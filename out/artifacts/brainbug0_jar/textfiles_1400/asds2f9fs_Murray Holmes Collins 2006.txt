A model of risk regulation is proposed to explain how people balance the goal of seeking closeness to
a romantic partner against the opposing goal of minimizing the likelihood and pain of rejection. The
central premise is that confidence in a partner’s positive regard and caring allows people to risk seeking
dependence and connectedness. The risk regulation system consists of 3 interconnected “if–then”
contingency rules, 1 cognitive, 1 affective, and 1 behavioral. The authors describe how general
perceptions of a partner’s regard structure the sensitivity of these 3 “if–then” rules in risky relationship
situations. The authors then describe the consequences of such situated “if–then” rules for relationship
well-being and conclude by integrating other theoretical perspectives and outlining future research
directions.
Keywords: relationships, rejection, perceived regard, risk, belongingness

risk substantial dependence (Kelley, 1979) to establish the kind of
satisfying relationship that can fulfill basic needs for belonging or
connectedness (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). They need to behave
in ways that give a partner power over their outcomes and emotions and to think in ways that invest great value and importance
in the relationship (Gagne & Lydon, 2004; Murray, 1999).
For instance, people in satisfying relationships respond to their
partner’s needs as they arise and leave the timing of repayment up
to the partner (Clark & Grote, 1998). They disclose self-doubts to
their partner, seeking social support for personal weaknesses that
could elicit rejection (Collins & Feeney, 2000; Simpson, Rholes, &
Nelligan, 1992). People in satisfying relationships also excuse
transgressions when a partner has behaved badly (Rusbult, Verette,
Whitney, Slovik, & Lipkus, 1991). Rather than being sensitized to
partner traits that might prime rejection concerns, people in satisfying relationships turn negatives into positives. They see virtues
in their partner that they do not see in others (Rusbult, Van Lange,
Wildschut, Yovetich, & Verette, 2000) and that are also not
apparent to their friends (Murray, Holmes, Dolderman, & Griffin,
2000) or their partner (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996a; Neff &
Karney, 2002). Taking such risks optimizes the benefits and minimizes the costs afforded by adult relationships (Kelley et al.,
2003; Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003).
These relationship-promotive transformations are critical for
fostering satisfying relationships. However, they also compromise
self-protection concerns by (a) increasing the likelihood of rejection in the short term and (b) intensifying how much the ultimate
loss of the relationship would hurt (Simpson, 1987). If Sally relies
on Harry for support, she will expose herself to some less than
supportive behavior on his part. If Sally sees Harry’s faults as
evidence of his special fit to her, she is also unlikely to believe that
others could make her as happy or that she could easily recover
from losing him (D. T. Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, &
Wheatley, 1998). Consequently, the intense social pain of losing a

How do people find the courage they need to love when risking
greater closeness to another leaves them more vulnerable to the
hurt and pain of rejection? The psychological costs of rejection
only increase as interdependence and closeness grow (Braiker &
Kelley, 1979; Leary & Baumeister, 2000). Imagine how crushing
it can be to have a request for a first date rejected or to have a
dating relationship end after a few months. Such rebuffs pale in
comparison with believing that one’s spouse is uninterested in
providing support or is attracted to the physical attributes of
another. In fact, the ultimate rejection, the dissolution of a marriage, is a substantial risk factor for self-doubt and depression
(Gotlib & Hammen, 1992).
Given the potential pain of romantic rejection, people should be
motivated to think and behave in ways that minimize dependence
on a partner and, consequently, minimize the likelihood of being
hurt (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000). However, people need to

valued other should increase people’s motivation to think and
behave in ways that both limit vulnerability to the partner’s actions
in the short term and diminish the long-term potential pain of
relationship loss.
The essential dilemma of interdependence is this: The thoughts
and behaviors that are critical for establishing satisfying close
connections with others necessarily increase both the short-term
risk of rejection and the long-term pain of rejection. This article
presents a conceptual model developed to explain how people
negotiate the conflict between the goal of creating satisfying
interpersonal connections and the goal of protecting themselves
against rejection.
The organizing assumption is that perceptions of a partner’s
regard and caring control a cognitive, affective, and behavioral
system for resolving this goal conflict (Murray, Bellavia, Rose, &
Griffin, 2003). The proposed model of the risk regulation system
stipulates three interconnected “if–then” contingency rules that
operate to track the risks of rejection and resolve conflicts between
self-protection and relationship-promotion goals. These rules involve the following: (a) an “appraisal” rule system that links
situations of dependence to the goal of gauging a partner’s acceptance, (b) a “signaling” rule system that links perceptions of a
partner’s acceptance or rejection to the experience of gratified or
hurt feelings and coincident gains or losses in self-esteem, and (c)
a “dependence regulation” rule system that links perceptions of a
partner’s acceptance or rejection to the willingness to risk future
dependence. Our objective is to specify the imprint that dependence dilemmas leave on relationships. We do this by detailing
how confidence in a partner’s regard prioritizes the pursuit of
secure connectedness goals and how doubts about a partner’s
regard prioritize the need for self-protection.

Dependence Dilemmas in Interpersonal Relationships
Situations of dependence are fundamental to romantic life. One
partner’s actions constrain the other’s capacity to satisfy important
needs and goals. Such dependence is evident from the lowest to the
highest level of generality. At the level of specific situations,
couples are interdependent in multiple and varied ways, ranging
from deciding whose movie preference to favor on a given weekend to deciding what constitutes a fair and appropriate allocation
of household chores. At a broader level, couples must negotiate
different personalities, such as merging one partner’s laissez-faire
nature with the other’s more controlled style. Couples are also
interdependent in their choice of relationship goals, such as deciding when and whether to have a child or finding a way to balance
one partner’s need for closeness with the other’s need for autonomy (Braiker & Kelley, 1979; Holmes, 2002). At the highest level,
the existence of the relationship itself requires both partners’
continued cooperation.
Inevitably, significant conflicts of interest and the necessity of
compromise and sacrifice will arise in these negotiations (Kelley,
1979). This dilemma is made all the more important because
people do not routinely choose the partner who would provide the
best (or even a decent) fit to their personality and goals (Lykken &
Tellegen, 1993). Take the simple example of a couple trying to
decide whether to go to the current blockbuster action film or a
contemplative arts film. Imagine that Sally confides to Harry that
she believes that seeing the action film will help distract her from

work worries, concerns that she fears the arts film Harry wants to
see will only compound. In making this request, Sally is putting
her psychological welfare in Harry’s hands. Consequently, like
most situations in which some sacrifice on Harry’s part is required,
Sally risks discovering that Harry is not willing to be responsive to
her needs.
The exact nature of such situations may change throughout a
relationship’s developmental course. However, it is precisely such
situations as these—situations of dependence in which one’s partner’s responsiveness to one’s needs is in question—that activate
the threat of rejection in romantic life. The risk of rejection in such
situations depends on the amount of control a partner has over
one’s outcomes and the degree to which the partner’s preferences
overlap with one’s own (Kelley et al., 2003). The riskiest situations
for Sally are ones in which Harry has control over her outcomes
but his preferences in the situation diverge from her own. Making
herself vulnerable to Harry’s preferences in such situations can
have real costs. In the example we have given, Sally might have to
endure the art film. However, the greater potential cost is a
symbolic one—namely, the perception that Harry might not care
about her goals or needs and, by extension, that he might not care
about her. Situations such as these highlight the risk of a much
more threatening form of rejection—the loss of the relationship
itself.
Given multiple layers of interdependence, people routinely find
themselves in situations in which they need to gauge how much
dependence they can safely risk. Throughout the course of the
relationship, partners need to make iterative and often implicit
choices between self-protection (decreasing dependence) and relationship promotion (increasing dependence). Consequently, to
risk being in the relationship, people need a system in place that
functions to keep them feeling reasonably safe in a context of
continued vulnerability. Consistent with this logic, models of
attachment and self-esteem assume that people strive to perceive
themselves and their social world in ways that allow them to feel
protected from harm in an unpredictable world (Greenberg, Solomon, & Pyszczynski, 1997; Mikulincer, Florian, & Hirschberger,
2003).
What types of relationship experiences afford insurance against
risk? How is this sense of assurance regulated across the diverse
situations that form any relationship? In the next two sections, we
describe a conceptual model developed to explain how people
resolve the tension between self-protection and relationship promotion inherent in dependence dilemmas. We first consider the
broadest situation of dependence—the relationship itself—and
stipulate the functional requirements of a risk regulation system. Then we describe how this system adapts itself to meet the
circumstances imposed by the level of risk inherent in specific
situations. We first develop our arguments at a conceptual level
and then document the empirical evidence illustrating how this
risk regulation system operates in the context of adult close
relationships.

The Risk Regulation System
The central assumption of the model is that negotiating interdependent life requires a cognitive, affective, and behavioral regulatory system for resolving the conflict between the goals of
self-protection and relationship promotion. The overarching goal

of this system is to optimize the sense of assurance that is possible
given one’s relationship circumstances.1 This sense of assurance is
experienced as a sense of safety in one’s level of dependence in the
relationship—a feeling of relative invulnerability to hurt. To optimize this sense of assurance, this system must function dynamically, shifting the priority given to the goals of avoiding rejection
and seeking closeness to accommodate the perceived risks of
rejection.
To carry out a dynamic function, this system needs a means of
estimating and summarizing the risk of rejection. The model
stipulates that confidence in a partner’s regard acts as an arbiter
that tells people whether it is safe to put self-protection aside and
risk thinking and behaving in relationship-promotive ways (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, Rose, & Bellavia,
2003; Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000). Figure 1 illustrates the
operation of this risk regulation system. It illustrates three “if–
then” rule systems needed to gauge the risks of rejection and make
the general situation of being involved in a relationship feel
sufficiently safe. Gauging and regulating rejection risk requires
appraisal (Path A), signaling or emotion (Path B), and behavioral
response (Path C) rules. These interconnected rule systems operate
in concert to prioritize self-protection goals (and the sense of
assurance that comes from maintaining distance) when the perceived risks of rejection are high or relationship-promotion goals
(and the sense of assurance that comes from feeling connected)
when the perceived risks of rejection are low.

The Appraisal System
The general situation of interdependence in Figure 1 refers to
the relationship over time. The link between dependence and
perceptions of the partner’s regard captures the assumption that
dependence increases people’s need to gauge a partner’s regard
(Path A in Figure 1). This path captures the operation of an
appraisal system— one that makes sense of the overall flow of
events. This contingency rule takes the form “if dependent, then
gauge acceptance or rejection.”
An appraisal system is necessary in romantic relationships because securing a caring and committed partner allows people to put

self-protection aside and risk connection to one specific person
(Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000). To accurately gauge rejection
risk, people need to be able to discern whether a chosen partner is
willing to meet their needs and commit to them. Paths D through
F in Figure 1 capture the supporting “if–then” contingencies governing appraisals of a partner’s regard for the self. These paths
stipulate that people rely on shared, largely implicit beliefs about
what qualities in the partner (Path D), the self (Path E), and the
dyad (Path F) indicate a high versus a low likelihood of a partner’s
acceptance and caring.
If people are to risk connection, the outcome of this appraisal
process needs to give them reason to trust in a partner’s responsiveness to needs in situations of dependence. Evolutionary and
attachment theorists assume that perceived responsiveness to
needs is the sine qua non of satisfying interpersonal relationships.
Perceived responsiveness is so critical because securing a partner
who is motivated to respond to one’s needs minimizes the likelihood of rejections that could threaten survival and the successful
transmission of one’s genes (Bowlby, 1982; P. Gilbert, 2005; Reis,
Clark, & Holmes, 2004; Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). In fact,
evolutionary theorists maintain that specialized cognitive mechanisms evolved to detect whether intimates perceive qualities in the
self that could not easily be obtained in alternative relationships.
Thus, the perception that others value the self makes them safe to
approach in times of difficulty (Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). Consistent with this logic, situational primes that activate belongingness needs sensitize people to cues that suggest which specific
others might be capable of responding to these needs (Gardner,
Pickett, & Brewer, 2000; Pickett, Gardner, & Knowles, 2004).
The particular experiences that afford optimistic expectations
about responsiveness likely vary across relationships and perhaps
across cultures (Berscheid & Regan, 2005). From the perspective
of the current model, the common diagnostic that affords confidence in a partner’s expected responsiveness to needs is the
perception that a partner perceives qualities in the self worth
1

We use the term assurance to invoke the idea of “confidence in mind
or manner” (Mish, 1995, p. 70).

valuing— qualities that are not readily available in other partners.
In more independent cultures, this sense of confidence requires the
inference that a partner perceives valued traits in the self (Murray,
Holmes, & Griffin, 2000; Swann, Bosson, & Pelham, 2002). In
more interdependent cultures, this sense of confidence requires the
additional inference that a partner’s family also values the qualities
one brings to the relationship (MacDonald & Jessica, in press).2

The Signaling System
The link between perceived regard and self-evaluations (Path B
in Figure 1) illustrates the operation of a signaling or emotion
system that detects discrepancies between current and desired
appraisals of a partner’s regard and mobilizes the energy for action
(Berscheid, 1983). That is, given the general goal of being
uniquely valued by a partner, perceiving signs of a partner’s
acceptance should feel good, and perceiving rejection should hurt.
The contingency rule governing the signaling system takes the
form “if accepted or rejected, then internalize.”
This rule reflects a basic assumption of the sociometer model of
self-esteem. Leary and Baumeister (2000; Leary, Tambor, Terdal,
& Downs, 1995; MacDonald & Leary, 2005) believed that the
need to protect against rejection is so important that people
evolved a system for reacting to rejection threats. The authors
argued that self-esteem is simply a gauge—a “sociometer”—that
measures a person’s perceived likelihood of being accepted or
rejected by others. The qualities that people come to value in
themselves, such as intelligence or social skills, are valued because
those are the qualities that people believe elicit interpersonal
acceptance and the likelihood of having their needs met by others.
The sociometer is thought to function such that signs that
another’s approval is waning diminish self-esteem (Leary, Cottrell,
& Misha, 2001; Leary et al., 2003; Leary, Haupt, Strausser, &
Chokel, 1998; Leary et al., 1995). This contingency is so powerful
and automatic that state self-esteem can be undermined by ostracism by a stranger (Leary et al., 1995), by a computer in a ball-toss
game (Zadro, Williams, & Richardson, 2004), and by the experience of disapproving others activated outside of conscious awareness (Baldwin, Carrell, & Lopez, 1990). Because the detection of
and reaction to physical and social pain operate through similar
brain and behavior systems, sensitivity to social pain is thought to
motivate people to avoid harmful situations and approach safer
ones (MacDonald & Leary, 2005). In this sense, the sociometer
functions not to preserve self-esteem per se but to protect people
from suffering the serious costs of rejection and not having their
needs met.
The need for such a signaling system is amplified in romantic
relationships because narrowing social connections to focus on one
specific partner raises the personal stakes of rejection. In committing himself to Sally, Harry narrows the number of people he can
rely on to satisfy his needs and, in so doing, makes his welfare all
the more dependent on Sally’s actions. In his routine interactions,
Harry also does not need to seek acceptance from someone he
perceives to be rejecting. However, in his relationship with Sally,
he is often caught in the position of being hurt by the person whose
acceptance he most desires. Thus, the level of dependence necessitated by a relationship constrains people’s capacity to fulfill their
needs in important ways. Imagining a permanent separation from
a partner even heightens the accessibility of death-related thoughts,

which suggests that people’s basic sense of physical well-being is
tied to their relationships (Mikulincer, Florian, Birnbaum, & Malishkovitz, 2002).
Given all that is at stake, the signal that is conveyed by this rule
system needs to be sufficiently strong to mobilize action (Berscheid, 1983). Perceiving rejection or drops in a partner’s acceptance should hurt and threaten people’s general and desired conceptions of themselves as being valuable, efficacious, and worthy
of interpersonal connection (Baumeister, 1993; Pyszczynski,
Greenberg, Solomon, Arndt, & Schimel, 2004; Taylor & Brown,
1988). By making rejection aversive, this signaling system motivates people to avoid situations in which relationship partners are
likely to be unresponsive and needs for connectedness are likely to
be frustrated. In contrast, perceiving acceptance should affirm
people’s sense of themselves as being good and valuable, mobilizing the desire for greater connection and the likelihood of
having one’s needs met by a partner.

The Behavioral Response System
The link between perceived regard and dependence-regulating
behavior captures the assumption that the threat and social pain of
rejection in turn shape people’s willingness to think and behave in
ways that promote dependence and connectedness (Murray,
Holmes, & Griffin, 2000). This path illustrates the operation of a
behavioral response system— one that proactively minimizes both
the likelihood and the pain of future rejection experiences by
making increased dependence contingent on the perception of
acceptance (Path C in Figure 1). As the direct and mediated paths
illustrate, this system may be triggered directly, by the experience
of acceptance or rejection, and indirectly, through resulting gains
or drops in self-esteem. The contingency rule governing this system is “if feeling accepted or rejected, then regulate dependence.”
The proposed model assumes that the behavioral response system operates to ensure that people only risk as much future
dependence as they feel is reasonably safe given recent experience.
Suggesting that felt acceptance is a relatively automatic trigger to
safety and the possibility of connection, unconsciously primed
thoughts of security heighten empathy for others (Mikulincer et al.,
2001), diminish people’s tendency to derogate out-group members
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2001), and increase people’s desire to seek
support from others in dealing with a personal crisis (Pierce &
Lydon, 1998). In contrast, experiencing rejection automatically
triggers the perception of risk and the desire to distance oneself
from the relationship. MacDonald and Leary (2005) argued that
rejection elicits a social pain akin to physical pain to trigger
2

Because we focus so heavily on the goal of feeling positively regarded
and loved by a partner, some readers might wonder whether the proposed
model contends that people care more about feeling valued and loved than
they care about actually being loved and valued. This is not the case. The
model assumes that people care most about actually being loved and valued
by specific others. Given the biases inherent in social perception and
people’s tendency to treat social perception as if it was veridical (Griffin &
Ross, 1991; Kenny, 1994), people are not likely to believe they are loved
unless they feel loved. For this reason, we argue that feeling positively
regarded by one’s partner is a necessary precondition for putting aside
self-protection goals and satisfying connectedness needs within specific
relationships.

increased physical distance between oneself and the source of the
pain. For instance, people respond to ostracism from strangers by
aggressing against those who ostracized them, which suggests that
the need to distance oneself from painful interactions is a relatively
basic and automatic one (Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, & Stucke,
2001).
Given the general operation of such a dependence regulation
system and the heightened need to protect against romantic rejection, people should implicitly regulate and structure dependence on
a specific partner in ways that allow them to minimize the shortterm likelihood and long-term potential pain of rejection (Murray,
Holmes, & Griffin, 2000).
When a partner’s general regard is in question and rejection
seems more likely, people should tread cautiously, reserve judgment, and limit future dependence on the partner. A first line of
defense might involve limiting the situations people are willing to
enter within their relationships. Efforts to delimit dependence by
choosing one’s situations carefully might involve conscious decisions to seek support elsewhere, disclose less, or follow exchange
norms. These strategies minimize the chance of being in situations
in which a partner might prove to be unresponsive. A second line
of defense might involve shifting the symbolic value attached to
the partner and the relationship itself. Such efforts might entail less
deliberative shifts in the way people construe their partner’s behavior and qualities, such as becoming less willing to excuse
specific transgressions (Bradbury & Fincham, 1990) or coming to
see a partner’s habitual lateness as maddening rather than endearing (Holmes & Rempel, 1989). By diminishing their partner’s
value as a source of connection and minimizing the pain of
rejection in advance, people can protect a sense of their own
worthiness of interpersonal connection against loss.
When confident of a partner’s general regard, people can more
safely risk increased dependence in the future. They can enter into

situations in which the partner has control over their immediate
outcomes, forgive transgressions, attach greater value to their
partner’s qualities, and risk a stronger sense of commitment to the
partner and relationship.3

Individual Differences in the Operation of the Risk
Regulation System
We are not arguing that all people are equally sensitive to the
“if–then” contingencies underlying the operation of this system at
all times and in all situations within a specific relationship. Instead,
the proposed model assumes that the sensitivity of the risk regulation system adapts itself to suit specific relationship circumstances. Figure 2 illustrates how feeling more or less positively
regarded by a specific partner interacts with event features to
control the sensitivity of appraisal (Path I), signaling (Path J), and
dependence regulation rules (Path K).
In this model, perceptions of the partner’s regard refers to
people’s general or cross-situational expectations. Situations of
dependence refers to the objective or “given” structure of specific
events (Kelley, 1979). The sociometer model assumes that drops in
felt acceptance are more motivating than increments (Leary &
Baumeister, 2000). Therefore, the events of primary interest are
ones that highlight the costs rather than the gains of dependence.
3

In depicting perceived regard as a pivotal causal variable, we are not
arguing that it is the only causal factor influencing self-evaluations or
dependence regulation. Other factors, such as people’s chronic dispositions
and attachment histories (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003) or the desire to
protect existing commitments (Rusbult & Buunk, 1993), are undoubtedly
important. The point is that perceived regard is a critical, often overlooked,
causal force that helps explain the role of these sources of influence. We
develop this argument further as we proceed.

<-----Page 5----->646

MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

Negative events, such as a partner’s intemperate remark, should be
more strongly associated with the activation of “if–then” contingency rules than positive events, such as a partner’s gentle touch.
These situations can be anticipatory (i.e., the possibility that a
partner might be unresponsive to one’s needs) or experienced in
nature (i.e., the actuality of perceiving a partner as hurtful or
rejecting).
The multiplicative function in Figure 2 illustrates the assumption that chronic perceptions of a partner’s regard interact with
specific event features to control the extent to which people
categorize or code specific events as situations of risk. To the
extent that Sally is unsure of Harry’s regard, even the mundane
choice of one movie over another could make concerns about
dependence salient. However, to the extent that Sally is more
confident of Harry’s regard, she might only begin to entertain
thoughts about her vulnerability to his actions when they try to
negotiate more serious decisions in their relationship, such as
deciding whose financial philosophy to follow. Once identified as
such, the possibility of rejection inherent in such “dependent”
situations activates a situated conflict between self-protection and
relationship-promotion goals, heightening the in-the-moment need
for a sense of assurance or safety.
The activation of the need for a sense of assurance or invulnerability to harm then triggers the appraisal, signaling, and behavior
response systems (either individually or in concert). The model
stipulates that a person’s habitual means of optimizing feelings of
assurance within the relationship is revealed in the idiosyncratic or
signature ways this person tailors or calibrates the operation of
these rules to prioritize self-protection or relationship-promotion
goals in specific situations of dependence (Paths I through K in
Figure 2). Mirroring this procedural emphasis, developmental
scholars argue that children develop behavioral strategies to maintain a sense of safety in interactions with caregivers that are
specialized to circumstance (Sroufe & Waters, 1977). Social cognition scholars also argue that strategic goals followed in relationships, such as cooperativeness or achievement, are activated when
significant other representations are primed (Baldwin, 1992;
Fitzsimons & Bargh, 2003; Shah, 2003).
In using the term signature, we expand the metaphor for personality developed by Mischel and Shoda (1995). They argued that
personality is best conceptualized in terms of consistent, situationspecific patterns of behavior, not in terms of stable, crosssituational tendencies (Mischel & Morf, 2003). In their model, the
psychological features of the situation correspond to characteristics of an interaction partner in a particular context, and “personality” is revealed in the way people tailor their cognition, affect,
and behavior with interaction partners in certain types of social
situations (e.g., a boss conveying criticism, a friend behaving
competitively, a spouse conveying praise). We posit a similar
Person ⫻ Situation structure in relationships. However, we define
a person’s relationship-specific “personality” in the way people
tailor appraisal, emotion, and behavioral rules to minimize the
level of rejection risk given the perceived features of the partner
and the dependent situation.

Perceived Regard and the Situated Pursuit of Assurance
For people who generally feel less positively regarded by a
specific partner, the goal of feeling valued and discerning the

partner’s caring is likely to be chronically activated (Murray,
Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). The chronic
accessibility of this goal should sensitize people who feel less
positively regarded to rejection threats, shaping the “if–then” contingencies that are activated in ways that put a premium on
self-protection.
Why is this the case? General expectations of rejection, such as
those embodied in low self-esteem, make specific rejection experiences all the more painful and all the more motivating (Leary &
Baumeister, 2000). For people who generally anticipate interpersonal rejection, the need to feel and be more included is sufficiently strong that their state self-esteem is sensitive to even
unconsciously activated rejection cues (Sommer & Baumeister,
2002) or signs of a stranger’s disapproval (Nezlek, Kowalski,
Leary, Blevins, & Holgate, 1997).
For people who generally feel less positively regarded by a
specific partner (i.e., lows), situated rejection experiences hurt
more because they pose a greater proportional loss to a more
precarious, generalized sense of their own worthiness of interpersonal connection. Consequently, such individuals are in particular
need of a self-protectively weighted or prevention-oriented rule
system (Higgins, 1996)— one that quickly detects rejection,
strongly signals the possibility of further hurt, and motivates them
to take defensive action sooner rather than later (Pietrzak,
Downey, & Ayduk, 2005). Thus, chronic doubts about Harry’s
regard require that Sally act as though she believes that minimizing
the pain of rejection provides greater assurance or safety from
harm than risking closeness. In a functional sense, being primed to
see rejection is likely the best means of avoiding even more
threatening situations (MacDonald & Leary, 2005). For lows, the
“if” part of their contingencies should operate like a hair trigger,
setting a low threshold for the identification of threat. Sally’s fear
of being hurt by Harry should cause her to vigilantly attend to
situational cues that categorize events in terms of dependence. She
should also be quick to perceive rejection so she might prevent
herself from getting closer and even more hurt. A regulatory
system that functions to prioritize self-protection goals best affords
people who generally feel less valued some minimal sense of
continued assurance in the relationship.
This general line of reasoning is echoed in classic formulations
of approach–avoidance conflicts and modern characterizations of
rejection sensitivity, anxiety disorders, and self-esteem. In translating Dollard and Miller’s (1950) analysis of approach–avoidance
conflicts, Epstein (1982) made the paradoxical point that people
can protect themselves from experiencing fear by making a particular goal or state more fearful. Put in technical terms, Sally’s
readiness to perceive rejection should increase her avoidance gradient, keeping her farther from situations that might prove to be
even more hurtful. Downey and Feldman (1996) made a conceptually related point in their analysis of rejection sensitivity. These
authors argued that chronic differences in the tendency to expect
and perceive rejection reflect the operation of the defensive motivational system (Pietrzak et al., 2005). This system is triggered by
the goal of avoiding threatening or dangerous situations (Lang,
Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1990). Similarly, Mineka and Sutton (1992)
argued that chronically high levels of anxiety automatically direct
people’s attention toward threatening stimuli so that they might
avoid such situations. For instance, threatening words, such as

<-----Page 6----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

injury or criticized, capture attention automatically for people
troubled by generalized anxiety (MacLeod, Mathews, & Tata,
1986). Similarly, Leary and Baumeister (2000) argued that the
sociometer is more reactive to rejection for people who are chronically low in self-esteem than it is for people who are chronically
high in self-esteem.
Rather than evaluating the evidence in an evenhanded way,
people who feel less positively regarded should respond to situations of dependence by becoming more concerned about concluding incorrectly that their partner cares about them (Holmes &
Rempel, 1989; Taylor, 1991). In appraising the meaning of ongoing events, people who feel less valued should be risk averse, more
ready to generalize from signs of rejection than to trust signs of
acceptance. They should also be readily hurt by perceiving rejection, questioning their own value and worth in the face of acute
rejections. Given the greater hurt, people who generally feel
less positively regarded should then react to acute rejections in
ways that minimize the potential for future hurt. Such efforts
might involve limiting dependence by becoming less willing to
self-disclose, to seek support, or to put oneself in situations in
which one’s outcomes are dependent on the partner’s actions.
Protective efforts could also involve diminishing the importance of the connection itself— by devaluing the partner and
relationship, turning to alternative relationships or sources of
support, or lashing out in ways that communicate such diminished sentiments.
For people who generally feel more positively regarded by a
specific partner (i.e., highs), there is little need for such a defensively calibrated rule system. For them, specific rejections pose a
smaller proportional loss to a comparably rich resource. Instead,
the goal of maintaining the desired level of confidence in the
partner’s positive regard and caring is likely to prevail (Murray,
Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). A regulatory
system that functions to prioritize relationship-promotion goals
better affords highs a continued sense of assurance or safety in the
relationship. In other words, confidence in Sally’s regard allows
Harry to act as though he believes that seeking closeness affords
the greatest safety from harm.
In appraising the meaning of specific situations of dependence,
people who generally feel more positively regarded set a high
threshold for detecting rejection. Rather than being primed to see
rejection, highs appraise and respond to most situations of dependence in ways that dispel unwanted rejection concerns and uncertainties and protect the desired sense of confidence in their partner’s positive regard and caring (Gagne & Lydon, 2004; Murray &
Holmes, 1993, 1994). In particular, specific situations of dependence should activate “if–then” contingencies that link potential
threats to motivated cognitive processes that bolster and protect
perceptions of the partner’s acceptance and caring. Even in situations in which they feel rejected, general expectations of partner
acceptance should dull the sting of specific hurts, protecting selfesteem from most experiences of rejection. In fact, general expectations of acceptance should give highs reason to believe that
seeking greater closeness to the partner will minimize rather than
exacerbate the likelihood of future hurts. Consequently, people
who generally feel more positively regarded should respond to
situated rejections in ways that foster greater dependence.

The Situated Operation of the Risk Regulation System
How might such dynamics play out in a specific situation of
dependence, such as a conflict? If Harry generally doubts Sally’s
regard, such situations remind him that depending on Sally is
risky. An insecure Harry should maintain some sense of safety in
the face of the acute tension between wanting to avoid rejection
and wanting to be close by activating procedural rules that put
self-protection at a premium. He should perceive rejection in
specific episodes (Path I, “if dependent situation, then question
acceptance”), feel hurt and personally diminished (Path J, “if
feeling acutely rejected, then internalize”), and respond to such
hurts by diminishing his dependence on Sally (Path K, “if feeling
acutely rejected, then decrease dependence”). If Harry felt more
confident of Sally’s regard, he might instead resolve such situated
tensions in favor of relationship-promotion goals. A secure Harry
should perceive evidence of acceptance in such episodes (Path I,
“if dependent situation, then bolster acceptance”), not be as seriously hurt when he feels acutely rejected (Path J, “if feeling
acutely rejected, then externalize”), and increase his dependence
on Sally in situations that highlight rejection risk (Path K, “if
feeling acutely rejected, then increase dependence”).
The specific translation of these “if–then” rules is likely to
depend on features of each partner’s expectations of caring and
features of the situation they face. Although people who feel less
positively regarded should generally set a lower threshold for
perceiving rejection, the events that activate the greatest concern
should be highly specific to the couple. For instance, some people
may experience chronic difficulties negotiating conflicts in their
relationship. For others, conflicts may be relatively easily resolved,
whereas situations in which one partner solicits the other’s support
may be more threatening. In the former case, conflicts might
activate concerns about dependence (e.g., “When I want something
different than my partner does, my partner will reject me”),
whereas occasions when support is solicited may activate more
optimistic assumptions (e.g., “If I have a problem at work, my
partner will try to solve it”). In the latter case, soliciting support
might activate concerns about rejection (e.g., “If I want my partner
to listen to my problems, my partner will ignore me”), whereas
conflicts may not.
The specific behavioral strategies that couples adopt to optimize
feelings of assurance or safety in the face of acute rejection
concerns should also be tailored to meet the constraints imposed
by features of each partner’s expectations and the situation they
face. People who generally feel more positively regarded by their
partner may differ in their habitual means of increasing closeness
in situations in which they feel rejected. For some, the activation
of rejection concerns may prompt the desire to express their needs
more clearly. For others, the activation of rejection concerns may
activate caregiving behaviors directed toward the partner. Similarly, some people who generally feel less positively regarded may
restore feelings of assurance through strategic efforts to reduce
dependence. For some, this might involve derogating the partner,
a relatively direct strategy. However, for others, such strategies
might be ineffective because their partner responds to such behavior in ways that trigger conflicts, and thus this approach would
further exacerbate rejection anxieties. In such circumstances, dependence reduction strategies might involve limiting conversation
to superficialities or turning to friends for support.

648

This new approach to understanding individual differences in
relationship functioning locates the core of a sense of assurance in
the habitual strategies people adopt to optimize a sense of invulnerability to harm in dependence dilemmas. In his seminal work,
Bowlby (1982) argued that the attachment system evolved to
protect infants from harm by fostering physical proximity to caregivers—that is, by satisfying the goal of “felt security” (Sroufe &
Waters, 1977). Early experiences of feeling more or less safe in the
presence of specific caregivers are thought to determine people’s
capacity to experience “felt security” in adult relationships (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). In this sense, “felt security” is a property
of a person’s disposition. Although we recognize the importance of
generalized expectations, the proposed model underscores the role
that specific expectations of a partner’s regard play in regulating
how people think and behave in the interdependence dilemmas
posed by adult relationships.
By advancing a social–psychological analysis of how a sense of
assurance— our translation of the “felt security” concept—is optimized in adult close relationships, we integrate central tenets of
attachment theory (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003), the sociometer
model (Leary & Baumeister, 2000), and interdependence theory
(Kelley, 1979, 1983). The risk regulation model we offer advances
these perspectives by arguing that confidence in a partner’s regard
activates “if–then” rules that sustain a sense of assurance by
prioritizing relationship-promotion goals and seeking connectedness. In contrast, doubts about a partner’s regard activate “if–then”
rules that sustain a sense of assurance by prioritizing selfprotection goals and avoiding rejection.
Attachment and interdependence theorists both conceptualize
relationships as a process of mutual influence (Kelley, 1983;
Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003; Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003). If the
model we offer provides a meaningful way of conceptualizing how
people optimize a sense of assurance, then the idiosyncratic contingencies that govern people’s cognition, affect, and behavior
should have interpersonal and relationship consequences. Paths L
through N in Figure 2 capture the potential for such effects. These
paths illustrate the possibility that the self-protective or
relationship-promotive contingencies evident in one partner’s
thoughts and behaviors should influence the contingencies evident
in the other partner’s thoughts and behaviors. The risk regulation
model we present assumes that relationships are most satisfying
and resilient when people set aside self-protection and promote
dependence.

Organizational Overview
We first evaluate the evidence for the operation of the appraisal,
signaling, and behavioral response rules within the general situation of relationship dependence. We then examine individual differences in how people calibrate and apply these rules in responding to specific situations of dependence. Next we detail
applications of the model by illustrating how the “if–then” rules
predict future relationship well-being. We also clarify enduring
issues in the literature, including why those people who need
relationships the most are likely to think and behave in ways that
undermine this need. We conclude by integrating alternative theoretical perspectives and by pointing to limitations in the literature
and future research directions.4

The Risk Regulation System: Normative
Contingency Rules
In this section, we address two questions. First, is monitoring a
partner’s regard a basic contingency of romantic life (Path A)?
Second, does feeling more or less positively regarded by a specific
partner have normative consequences for self-evaluations (Path B)
and dependence regulation (Path C) that are evident across people
involved in close relationships?

The Appraisal System: If Dependent, Then
Gauge Acceptance
Consistent with models of attachment (Mikulincer & Shaver,
2003), interdependence (Kelley, 1979), and self-esteem (Leary &
Baumeister, 2000), the model presented in Figures 1 and 2 assumes that people need to convince themselves that their partner
sees reason to be caring and responsive toward them. To support
this inference, people need to believe that their partner sees qualities in them worth valuing— qualities that are not readily available
in others.5 Consistent with this logic, people in dating relationships
report wanting their partner to see them as more physically attractive than they see themselves (Swann et al., 2002). People in dating
and marital relationships also report wanting their partner to see
them more positively than they see themselves on qualities of
interpersonal value, such as warmth and tolerance (Murray,
Holmes, & Griffin, 2000). Believing that a partner perceives these
hoped-for selves affords greater confidence in that partner’s love
and continuing commitment (Drigotas, Rusbult, Wieselquist, &
Whitton, 1999). In fact, people in dating and marital relationships
report greater confidence in their partner’s continued love when
they believe their partner sees them more positively than they see
themselves (Murray, Holmes, Griffin, Bellavia, & Rose, 2001).
In arguing for the importance of feeling uniquely valued, the
proposed model does not assume that people are motivated to
overstate how much a partner values them. Instead, it assumes that
people strive to be correct in reaching the desired inference that
their partner sees special qualities in them. People may approach
the early stages of a relationship with a deliberative mind-set—
conscientiously tracking the available evidence for signs of a
partner’s caring (Taylor & Gollwitzer, 1995). However, once a
person is confident of a partner’s caring, appraisal processes may
shift to the implemental task of sustaining this conclusion.
4
Given the voluminous nature of the literature on interpersonal relationships, it is also necessary to delimit the scope of this article in two main
respects. Although the proposed model has implications for furthering an
understanding of the precursors to relationship initiation, the model focuses
on already initiated relationships. Rich conceptualizations of the precursors
of initiation and related phenomena, such as unrequited love, are available
elsewhere (e.g., Baumeister, Wotman, & Stillwell, 1993; Berscheid &
Regan, 2005). Although we draw heavily on attachment theory and research to support the arguments offered, available space also precludes a
detailed discussion of the developmental origins of felt security and its
varied consequences. Rich descriptions of these processes have been provided by Mikulincer and Shaver (2003), Fraley and Shaver (2000), and
Hazan and Shaver (1994).
5
Although the theme of appraisal is central to work on close relationships, no review to date has specified how people actually learn about a
partner’s acceptance.

<-----Page 8----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

In summary, the model stipulates that people monitor a partner’s
regard and caring not just to gauge rejection risks (a kind of
prevention motivation) but also to secure acceptance (a kind of
promotion motivation). Consistent with the importance placed on
partner-specific expectations of acceptance, relationships generally
thrive when people both feel and are more valued by their partner.
For instance, feeling cared for by a partner is the strongest predictor of attachment security in specific relationships (Davila &
Sargent, 2003; La Guardia, Ryan, Couchman, & Deci, 2000). In
both dating and marital relationships, people also report greater
satisfaction and less conflict the more positively they believe their
partner sees their interpersonal qualities (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000), the more loved they feel (Murray et al., 2001), and the
more positively their partner actually regards them (Murray et al.,
1996a). People also report similar relationship benefits when their
partner feels more positively regarded.6

The Operation of the Appraisal System: Supporting
If–Then Contingency Rules
A basic inferential dilemma exists throughout relationships:
Without any direct means of establishing insight into the contents
of another’s consciousness, how can people gauge whether a
specific partner perceives qualities worth valuing in them? The
existing evidence suggests that people solve this puzzle by invoking shared, largely implicit beliefs about the contingencies underlying interpersonal acceptance (Baldwin & Sinclair, 1996). This
set of contingencies links the likelihood of acceptance to qualities
in the partner, the self, and the dyad.
Partner-based contingencies. In gauging acceptance, people
rely in part on judgments about whether a partner possesses the
kinds of qualities that foster responsiveness. Evolutionary perspectives on the formation of pair bonds maintain that people are drawn
to others who are attractive, warm, and cooperatively motivated
because such traits signal a willingness to form social connections
(Gangestad & Simpson, 2000; Hazan & Diamond, 2000). However, the perception of desirable traits in the partner is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for confident inferences about a partner’s caring. Perceiving Sally as kind and responsive has little
value for Harry if Sally is not motivated to be kind to him.
Consequently, people need to gauge their partner’s likely personality or demeanor within the context of their relationship.
To assess such interpersonal dispositions, people rely on implicit theories about the value of self-sacrificing behaviors (e.g., “If
partner sacrifices, then acceptance”). Interdependence theorists
argue that people understand that some partner behaviors are more
diagnostic than others (Kelley, 1979). Consider the attributions
Sally might make if Harry reveals embarrassing information about
himself. His willingness to make himself vulnerable signals his
commitment to her and gives Sally greater reason to trust him.
Similarly, if Harry volunteers to do chores that he and Sally
dislike, he demonstrates his selfless concern for her welfare. However, Sally would learn little about his responsiveness if he chose
those chores that he liked and she disliked.
As relationships develop, people rely on such augmentation and
discounting attribution principles to draw inferences about their
partner’s caring (Holmes & Rempel, 1989; Kelley, 1979). For
instance, people report greater trust in their partner’s caring when
they witness signs of their partner’s commitment, such as their

649

partner’s selfless responsiveness to their needs or willingness to
excuse their transgressions (Wieselquist, Rusbult, Foster, & Agnew, 1999). People also are more likely to feel cared for when their
partner discloses personally revealing information over mundane
facts (see Reis & Shaver, 1988, for a review). A partner’s willingness to provide support for one’s own revealing disclosures
similarly reinforces feelings of trust (Collins & Feeney, 2004).
Witnessing Harry’s responsiveness should give Sally greater reason to trust both in Harry’s benevolent nature and, more important,
in his caring for her.
Self-based contingencies. In gauging a partner’s regard, people cannot escape the biases imposed by their own self-views
(Griffin & Ross, 1991; Kenny, 1994; Shrauger & Schoeneman,
1979). People with a history of inconsistent attachment experiences possess less positive and more uncertain beliefs about themselves than people with a more secure attachment history (Collins
& Read, 1990). Similar self-doubts characterize people troubled by
low global self-esteem (J. D. Campbell, 1990) or rejection sensitivity (Downey & Feldman, 1996). Attachment theorists argue that
people use such generalized models to gauge current relationship
contingencies (Collins & Read, 1994; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003).
In particular, people seem to operate on the basis of contingencies
that link the possession of desirable qualities to interpersonal
acceptance and undesirable qualities to rejection (Baldwin & Sinclair, 1996).
Knowing that the regard of others is earned, people troubled by
self-doubts may have trouble understanding why a partner who
must see many faults in them and who seems superior to them
would really care for them or remain committed. In both dating
and marital relationships, people with low self-esteem underestimate how positively their partner sees them on specific traits
(Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000) and even underestimate how
much their partner loves them (Murray et al., 2001). People who
are more sensitive to rejection or more preoccupied in attachment
style also underestimate their dating partner’s relationship satisfaction and commitment (Downey & Feldman, 1996; Tucker &
Anders, 1999). In contrast, confidently held, positive self-views
provide a readily accessible, compelling rationale for a partner’s
caring.
Dyadic-based contingencies. People also seem to rely heavily
on dyadic cues to gauge a partner’s regard. These are cues that
suggest a partner is likely to be accepting because he or she falls
within one’s “league.” To feel loved, people need to believe that
they are just as good a person as their partner (Murray et al., 2005).
Accordingly, people treat the perception of similarity as a cue to
acceptance because similarity allows them to justify why their
partner might value and care for them (Condon & Crano, 1988).
After all, Harry is not likely to feel confident in Sally’s apparent
affections if he thinks her greater physical attractiveness or superior social skills put her effectively out of his league.
6
The proposed model does not claim that feeling understood by a
partner is unimportant (Reis & Shaver, 1988; Swann, Hixon, & De La
Ronde, 1992). Instead, it assumes that people need to be able to pinpoint
(good) reasons why their partner would value them overall before they are
likely to believe that their partner would tolerate their more negative
qualities. In fact, for low self-esteem people there may be special value in
believing that their partner sees their faults but values them nonetheless.

<-----Page 9----->650

MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

Supporting this logic, social exchange theorists reason that
people possess implicit theories about the importance of matching
a partner’s worth on consensually valued qualities and pin their
hopes on people who are perceived to be of similar net social
worth (Berscheid & Walster, 1969; Murstein, 1970; Thibaut &
Kelley, 1959; Walster, Walster, & Berscheid, 1978). Evolutionary
theorists also believe that the cognitive system has evolved specific mechanisms to automatically detect violations of fair exchange principles (Cosmides & Tooby, 1992). Even people’s
images of an ideal romantic partner are constrained by their
self-perceptions on most dimensions, reflecting the implicit assumption that one can find greater happiness by aspiring to a
partner within one’s league (L. Campbell, Simpson, Kashy, &
Fletcher, 2001).
A large literature suggests that the perception of similarity is
indeed one of the most powerful triggers of interpersonal attraction
(Berscheid & Reis, 1998). People express more interest in pursuing relationships with dating partners whose levels of physical
attractiveness and social desirability match their own (Berscheid,
Dion, Walster, & Walster, 1971). Rather than fading with increasing interdependence, the heuristic value of perceiving similarity in
worth only increases over time. Couples in stable relationships
believe their own level of physical attractiveness matches their
partner’s attractiveness (Feingold, 1988). Satisfied married intimates even inflate perceptions of similarity, exaggerating how
much their spouse shares the same traits, values, and feelings
(Murray, Holmes, Bellavia, Griffin, & Dolderman, 2002).
In situations that might activate unsettling concerns about inferiority, satisfied dating and married intimates react to the threat
posed by one partner outperforming the other by perceiving such
imbalances as complementary—that is, by seeing one partner’s
success as relevant to that partner but irrelevant to the self (Beach
et al., 1998; Beach, Whitaker, Jones, & Tesser, 2001). People are
sufficiently concerned with being outperformed by close others
that they are less willing to provide close than distant others with
performance-enhancing information (Pemberton & Sedikides,
2001). Conversely, when romantic partners conclude that their
contributions to the relationship are unequal, they report less
satisfaction and commitment (Hill, Rubin, & Peplau, 1976; Sprecher, 1988, 2001).7

Accuracy of Perception
Given the inherent difficulty in discerning the contents of another’s mind, people rely on specific contingencies to gauge a
partner’s positive regard and love. Reliance on such rules does
provide reasonable insight. In dating and marital relationships,
people who believe their partner sees them more positively on
specific traits are better regarded (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin,
2000). People who feel more loved also tend to be more loved
(Murray et al., 2001). Clouding this level of acuity, people also
assume that their partner sees as much (or as little) to value in them
as they see in themselves. Consequently, people’s capacity to be
confident of their partner’s regard is constrained as much by their
dispositions as by any reality in the relationship.

A Normative Rule System?
The literature reviewed supports the contention that dependence
motivates people to gauge a partner’s regard. Is an appraisal rule

a necessary component of a risk regulation system? At first glance,
low self-esteem people seem to be an exception to this rule. In both
dating and marital relationships, they underestimate how positively
their partner regards their traits (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000)
and how much their partner loves them (Murray et al., 2001).
Rather than seeking positive regard, perhaps low self-esteem people put greater priority on verifying a negative self-image. In fact,
low self-esteem people express greater feelings of intimacy when
their spouse verifies their self-image on concrete traits (Swann et
al., 1992).
The bulk of the existing evidence suggests that the insecurities
of low self-esteem people arise despite their desire to establish
confidence in a partner’s positive regard and love. Feeling valued
by a specific partner is likely to be more important for low than for
high self-esteem people because general anxieties about rejection
leave low self-esteem people feeling deprived of secure connections in other relationships as well (Leary et al., 1995). Moreover,
even low self-esteem people want their partner to see them more
positively than they see themselves when it comes to the traits
valued most in relationships (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000;
Swann et al., 2002).
In experimental situations in which low self-esteem people are
led to believe that their partner actually is within their league, they
also express just as much confidence in their dating partner’s
acceptance and love as do high self-esteem people. For instance,
low self-esteem people react to perceiving new flaws in their
partner by reporting greater confidence in their partner’s acceptance (Murray et al., 2005). Rather than being intractable, their
insecurities stem in part from remediable feelings of inferiority to
the partner. The finding that low self-esteem people readily identify reasons to trust in their partner’s acceptance suggests that they
are motivated to find reason to feel valued and accepted. However,
they have difficulty constructing the rationale necessary to sustain
optimistic perceptions in normal circumstances (Kunda, 1990).
Is constructing a rationale for a partner’s love necessary for
everyone? Attachment theorists argue that people develop generalized expectations of others as more or less accepting through
early interactions with caregivers (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). If
the lessons learned in such interactions are sufficiently positive,
might this alone be enough to foster confidence in a specific
partner’s positive regard and love?8
Growing evidence suggests that, rather than exhibiting a style of
attachment that is stable across relationship contexts, people exhibit different attachment “styles” with different significant others
(Baldwin, Keelan, Fehr, Enns, & Koh-Rangarajoo, 1996; Cook,
2000; Cozzarelli, Hoekstra, & Bylsma, 2000; Overall, Fletcher, &
7
Consistent with the emphasis on the reassuring value of perceiving
similarity, people who are anxious–ambivalent in attachment style and,
thus, particularly in need of relationships and anxious about interpersonal
rejection are likely to assume even greater similarity between themselves
and others than people who are less anxious about rejection (Mikulincer,
Orbach, & Iavnieli, 1998).
8
The argument that dispositional security may obviate the need for
specific secure representations may strike some readers as a particularly
strong form of attachment theory. We are sympathetic to this view, as
many attachment scholars would argue that even people who are dispositionally secure in attachment style pay attention to relevant, specific
behavioral evidence (Bowlby, 1982; Collins & Read, 1994).

<-----Page 10----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

Friesen, 2003). Such specificity points to the normative and adaptive importance of forming expectations about a specific partner’s
availability and responsiveness. Reanalyses of existing data further
buttress this point. If dispositional security can substitute for
partner-specific expectations of caring, the association between
believing that a partner regards one’s traits positively and feeling
loved should be substantially reduced for secure types. The association between feeling positively regarded and reporting greater
satisfaction should be similarly diminished. However, regardless
of people’s dispositional attachment style, intimates report feeling
more loved and being more satisfied the more positively they
believe their partner regards their traits (Murray, 2005). This
suggests that justifying perceptions of a partner’s love is indeed a
normative goal and that partner-specific expectations are a critical
feature of people’s relationship representations.

The Signaling System: If Feeling Accepted or Rejected,
Then Internalize
As people update and revise their perceptions of how accepting
or rejecting a partner is likely to be, do such appraisals turn people
inward and shape the inferences they draw about their own worthiness of love and care? The lessons conveyed by people’s social
environment shape their sense of self-worth from infancy well into
adulthood (Baldwin, 1992; Bowlby, 1982; Cooley, 1902; Leary &
Baumeister, 2000; Mead, 1934; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003;
Shrauger & Schoeneman, 1979). For instance, across casual acquaintanceships, close friendships, parent– child relationships, and
romantic relationships, people’s views of themselves mirror the
image they perceive in the eyes of others (Felson, 1989; Kenny,
1994; McNulty & Swann, 1994).

The Romantic Relationship Context
The practical and symbolic gains of eliciting acceptance and the
costs of rejection are magnified in close relationships because this
context necessitates such high levels of dependence on another’s
willingness to meet one’s needs. People’s sense of themselves is so
sensitive to interpersonal ties that simply being exposed to a novel
person who resembles a significant other shifts the content of the
working self-concept to resemble the sense of self that is experienced in the presence of the significant other (Hinkley &
Andersen, 1996). In both Eastern and Western cultures, which are
thought to differ in the importance of relationships for self-esteem,
people with more negative peer and family relations report lower
self-esteem (Abe, 2004).
Expectations of a partner’s acceptance can be internalized and
shape self-esteem over repeated interactions and experiences
within a specific romantic relationship. Intimates who believe their
hoped-for selves are not well understood or nurtured by their
partner report greater discrepancy between their actual and ideal
selves over time (Drigotas et al., 1999; Ruvolo & Brennan, 1997).
The opposite is true for people who feel more affirmed. Similarly,
dating intimates who believe their partner sees them relatively
negatively on specific interpersonal qualities see themselves more
negatively on these traits over time (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin,
2000). Being the object of a partner’s relatively negative appraisals
even decreases self-esteem and attachment security over time
(Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996b). The opposite is the case for

651

people who feel (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000) and actually
are more valued (Murray et al., 1996b). People who have suffered
the dissolution of a dating relationship or marriage (especially
those who did not want the relationship to end) report experiencing
great personal pain and anxiety about their worthiness of love
(Gotlib & Hammen, 1992; Gray & Silver, 1990). Even people who
report having had an unrequited love describe the experience as
causing them to question their worth and value as a relationship
partner (Baumeister et al., 1993).
As these varied examples illustrate, interdependent exchanges
with a romantic partner strongly influence the inferences people
draw about the value of the qualities they possess. People implicitly assume that others will seek them out only to the extent that
they possess qualities of value to others (Baldwin & Sinclair,
1996). Such interdependent exchanges likely constrain people’s
assessments of their likelihood of soliciting love. Consequently,
perceiving rejection hurts not just because it thwarts people’s
general desire to be included (Leary & Baumeister, 2000). Instead,
feeling less than fully valued by one’s partner especially hurts
because of its symbolic message—it raises the specter of a future
absent of social connection.

A Normative Rule System?
The literature reviewed suggests that perceiving a partner’s
acceptance or rejection modifies people’s self-evaluations. Is a
signaling rule necessary within a risk regulation system? If the
lessons learned in early interactions are sufficiently positive, might
this be enough to protect people’s self-esteem against later experiences with less accepting others (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003)? If
this were the case, the tendency for people who feel more valued
by a specific partner to report higher self-esteem should be noticeably reduced for people who are more dispositionally secure in
attachment style. Contrary to this suggestion, married intimates
who feel less positively regarded by their spouse report lower
self-esteem regardless of attachment style (Murray, 2005). Further
evidence suggests that the self-esteem of people who claim not to
need or want social ties still is sensitive to social contingencies.
People who are high in attachment-related avoidance report higher
self-esteem when they are led to believe that others will be accepting of them (Carvallo & Gabriel, 2006). Being rejected also
threatens state self-esteem for people who claim their sense of self
is not contingent on others (Leary et al., 2003).

The Behavioral Response System: If Feeling Accepted or
Rejected, Then Regulate Dependence
Given the symbolic stakes, people should regulate a sense of
connection to others in ways that optimize feelings of assurance
within this context of continued vulnerability. Doubts about a
partner’s regard should activate self-protection goals—fostering
thoughts and behaviors that decrease dependence and minimize the
short-term risk and long-term pain of rejection. In contrast, confidence in a partner’s regard should activate relationshippromotion goals—fostering thoughts and behaviors that increase
dependence and heighten the risk of rejection.
The pervasiveness of dependence regulation effects emerged
first in the literature in the reciprocity of liking principle (Berscheid & Walster, 1969). The phenomenon of people liking those

<-----Page 11----->652

MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

who like them is so robust that Kenny (1994) described it as a
cultural truism. This effect is usually explained in terms of social
exchange: Liking is reciprocated because it is rewarding to be
liked.9 However, this logic does not fully explain the breadth of
these data.
In the platonic relationships typically examined, reciprocity of
liking increases as relationships deepen in interdependence
(Kenny, 1994). People also assume much more reciprocity of
liking than actually exists (Kenny, 1994). Neither of these effects
follows easily from social exchange logic. Perceiving another’s
liking should decrease in reinforcement value as partners become
more interdependent and more familiar. Also, distorting another’s
liking should not convey the practical rewards and reinforcements
that actually being liked provides. The assumption that people first
need some sense of confidence in another’s regard before they
allow themselves to risk closeness anticipates both of these effects.
As interdependence (and the negative consequences of rejection)
increases, people should become all the more in need of the kind
of psychological assurance provided by perceiving another’s positive regard.
Consistent with this logic, attachment theorists believe that
finding that a significant other is not available or responsive in
times of crisis is sufficiently self-threatening that such experiences
can effectively deactivate proximity-seeking behaviors (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). For instance, when infants’ attempts to
elicit care go unmet, they develop avoidant behavioral patterns in
stressful situations, actively diverting attention away from their
caregivers (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). In adulthood, people who have suffered hurt feelings at the hands of
specific others report that the incident caused them to restrict or
sever the nature of their relationship with the transgressor (Leary,
Springer, Negel, Ansell, & Evans, 1998). When the general risks
of relationship loss are experimentally primed, dating intimates
become less trusting of their partner. They see their partner’s past
transgressions as more serious in nature, and they become less
willing to believe excuses for these transgressions (Boon &
Holmes, 1999).
People also report greater feelings of closeness to a partner in a
specific interaction when they perceive that person to be more
accepting of their self-disclosures (Laurenceau, Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998). However, people report feeling less close
when the recipient of such self-disclosures is perceived to be less
accepting. People are also more willing to offer help that puts them
at a disadvantage when they believe a prospective relationship
partner is available for a deeper, more caring relationship than
when they believe a partner is available for only a more superficial,
exchange-based relationship (Clark, Mills, & Powell, 1986). People who are highly socially anxious and anticipate rejection in
most interpersonal contexts also report behaving in a cold, distant
way toward others (Alden & Phillips, 1990).
In terms of the qualities people attribute to a partner—the social
inference that is perhaps most critical for establishing secure
connections—people in both dating and marital relationships reserve judgment, not letting themselves believe that they have
found the right partner until they feel confident of that partner’s
positive regard. People are more likely to idealize their partner’s
traits when they believe their partner sees them more positively on
interpersonally valued traits (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000).
They are also more likely to idealize their partner the more loved

they feel (Murray et al., 2001). In contrast, dating and marital
intimates are more likely to find fault in their partner’s traits when
they are more uncertain about their partner’s regard. Such dependence regulation is also evident over time, pointing to the causal
priority of perceived regard in fostering satisfaction and connectedness. Dating intimates who initially feel more positively regarded report greater certainty in their commitment to their partner
later on. They also come to see their partner’s traits more generously (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000).

A Reaction to a Real Threat?
Keeping a safe distance or even dissolving a relationship is an
adaptive response for people who accurately perceive that their
partner is not committed to them. It is simply too risky a gamble
to forgo the potential to find a more caring partner. When people’s
sense of their partner’s regard is calibrated, dependence regulation
may function as a “stop” routine that preempts fruitless relationship pursuits (MacDonald & Leary, 2005). Such calibration is not
always evident. Consequently, dependence regulation efforts may
be misplaced. The effects reported by Murray, Holmes, and Griffin
(2000) and Murray et al. (2001) remained evident when people’s
perceptions of their partner’s regard were controlled. Such findings
suggest that dependence regulation does not simply reflect one
partner’s tendency to mirror the sentiments of the other—a kind of
reciprocity effect. Instead, unwarranted insecurities about the partner’s regard can motivate people to put the goal of self-protection
ahead of the goal of relationship promotion.10

A Normative Rule System?
The literature reviewed suggests that people generally allow
only as much practical and symbolic dependence on a partner as
feels safe given their level of confidence in that partner’s regard.
Is a dependence regulation rule a necessary part of a risk regulation
system? Perhaps people who generally anticipate acceptance, such
as people who are high in self-esteem or secure in attachment style,
can risk dependence without needing this form of reassurance. If
that is the case, the association between perceived regard and
relationship promotion should be greatly reduced. However, regardless of self-esteem or attachment style, people perceive greater
value in their partner’s traits the more loved and positively regarded they feel (Murray, 2005).

Individual Differences in Contingency Rule Sensitivity
How does this risk regulation system adapt itself to circumstance? Figure 2 illustrates the proposition that feeling more or less
9
Historically, the causal dynamics thought to underlie reciprocity of
liking have been a source of considerable confusion. Scholars often describe the dynamic as Sally’s liking of Harry causing Sally to perceive
Harry’s liking of her—the exact opposite causal process of the social
exchange and dependence regulation perspectives.
10
In underscoring the costs of underestimating a partner’s regard, we
should also mention that there are likely to be costs of overestimating a
partner’s regard as well. For instance, a high self-esteem Harry is not likely
to be served well over the longer term by being unaware of the most
obvious signs of Sally’s disaffection. We focus on unwarranted insecurities
because these types of misperceptions are more common (Murray, Holmes,
& Griffin, 2000; Murray et al., 2001).

<-----Page 12----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

positively regarded by a partner interacts with features of specific
events to structure the nature of the “if–then” contingency rules
people adopt. The risk regulation model assumes that feeling less
positively regarded by a partner generally primes self-protection
goals. Questioning a partner’s regard activates “if–then” contingencies that link situations of dependence to the perception
of rejection, hurt feelings and diminished self-esteem, and
behavioral and psychological tactics meant to diminish dependence. In contrast, feeling more positively regarded generally
primes relationship-promotion goals. Confidence in a partner’s
regard activates “if–then” contingencies that link situations of
dependence to the perception of acceptance and efforts to
increase dependence.
In examining the evidence for individual differences in the
operation of the risk regulation system, we focus on research that
examines how expectations of acceptance shape people’s appraisals and responses in specific situations of dependence. We review
literature that includes both direct and dispositional measures of
acceptance expectations because the model stipulates that specific
expectations of acceptance reflect general self-views (Path E in
Figure 1) and current relationship contingencies (Paths D and F in
Figure 1). We review experimental, observational, and daily diary
studies that examine how dispositional proxies for perceived regard affect how people think, feel, and behave in situations involving acute self-doubts (e.g., Murray, Holmes, MacDonald, &
Ellsworth, 1998), induced needs for support (Collins & Feeney,
2004), acute concerns about the partner’s responsiveness (e.g.,
Collins, 1996; Murray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, & Kusche, 2002;
Simpson, Ickes, & Grich, 1999), and conflict (e.g., Ayduk,
Downey, Testa, Yen, & Shoda, 1999; Campbell, Simpson, Boldry,
& Kashy, 2005). The dispositional proxies we examine include
global self-esteem (e.g., Murray, Rose, et al., 2002), attachmentrelated anxiety (e.g., Simpson et al., 1999), and rejection sensitivity (e.g., Downey & Feldman, 1996). These dispositional expectations operate similarly to partner-specific expectations of
acceptance.
In a longitudinal daily diary study of married couples, Murray,
Bellavia, et al. (2003; Murray, Griffin, Rose, & Bellavia, 2003)
used a direct measure of expectations of a specific partner’s regard
and tracked how couples negotiated a wide variety of dependent
situations over 21 days. Participants rated how they believed their
partner saw them on positive and negative interpersonal attributes
(i.e., perceived regard), such as warmth, criticalness, and responsiveness (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000). In each diary, participants indicated which specific situations of dependence had
occurred that day (e.g., “had a minor disagreement,” “partner
criticized me”) and completed state items tapping self-esteem (e.g.,
felt “good about myself”), how rejected or accepted they felt by
their partner (e.g., “rejected or hurt by my partner,” “my partner
accepts me as I am”), perceptions of the partner’s responsiveness
(e.g., “my partner is selfish”), and closeness (e.g., “in love with my
partner”). The researchers then obtained reports of marital satisfaction 1 year after the daily diary period.

Individual Differences in Appraisal Sensitivity
Contingencies
Although the prospect of dependence generally activates the
goal of gauging a partner’s regard (Path A in Figure 1), the

653

sensitivity of this appraisal rule shifts according to the circumstances afforded by generally feeling more or less valued by a
partner in situations that are more or less risky (Path I in Figure 2).
Situations of dependence should readily activate concerns about
rejection for people who generally feel less positively regarded by
their partner (i.e., “if dependent situation, then question acceptance”). For people who generally feel more positively regarded,
the goal of preserving a sense of assurance should activate
relationship-promotive contingencies that link situations of dependence to bolstered perceptions of acceptance (i.e., “if dependent
situation, then bolster acceptance”). Such “if–then” contingencies
might involve the automatic activation of excuses or a selective
search through memory for those occasions when the partner
proved to be particularly responsive (Kunda, 1990). In examining
these hypotheses, we explore two situations of dependence—selfbased situations, in which one person needs support, and
relationship-based situations, in which a partner initiates a conflict
or behaves negatively.

Appraisal Sensitivity and Self-Based Situations of
Dependence
Imagine that Sally gets criticized at work for failing to complete
a project. Such situations activate the attachment system and the
need to seek another’s literal or symbolic validation (Collins &
Feeney, 2000). In fact, priming failure-related thoughts activates
thoughts of seeking proximity to others (Mikulincer, Birnbaum,
Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000) and increases the accessibility of a
romantic partner’s name (Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002).
However, to the extent that Sally feels unsure of Harry’s regard,
she may be reluctant to disclose a personal failing for fear he might
be disparaging of her. Instead, such a situation may activate
“if–then” contingencies that link her failures to Harry’s likely
rejection. Consistent with this logic, people who are low in selfesteem—that is, people who generally doubt the acceptance of
others—see interpersonal acceptance as more conditional in nature. In a lexical decision task, low self-esteem people were
quicker to identify rejection-related words when they were primed
with failure than when they were primed with success, and they
were quicker to identify acceptance-related words when they were
primed with success than with failure (Baldwin & Sinclair, 1996).
Such implicit contingencies were not evident for people who were
high in self-esteem. Consequently, to the extent that Sally felt
more confident of Harry’s regard, she might readily compensate
for her work-related angst by reminding herself how much Harry
values her, using him as a resource for self-affirmation.
We find evidence of these differential appraisal contingencies in
the daily diary study and experimental research. In the diary study,
on days after participants felt badly about themselves, those who
generally believed their partner regarded them more positively
actually felt more loved and accepted by their partner (Murray,
Griffin, et al., 2003). Unfortunately, intimates who generally felt
less valued did not find this symbolic source of support or comfort
in their partner.
Similarly, people who are high in self-esteem and, thus, dispositionally likely to feel more valued by their partner react to threats
to self-esteem by becoming even more convinced of their dating
partner’s acceptance and love (Murray et al., 1998). For instance,
high self-esteem participants reacted to failure on a purported test

<-----Page 13----->654

MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

of intelligence by exaggerating their partner’s love (relative to high
self-esteem controls). In contrast, dating intimates who were low
in self-esteem reacted to experimentally induced doubts about their
intelligence or considerateness by expressing greater concerns
about their partner’s likely rejection (Murray et al., 1998).

Appraisal Sensitivity and Partner-Based Situations of
Dependence
Now imagine that Sally comes home to find Harry in an irritable
mood, grumbling about the lack of food in the fridge and the fact
that Sally had promised to replenish the fridge’s contents by day’s
end. To the extent that Sally trusts Harry’s continuing positive
regard, such situations might activate appraisal contingencies that
link Harry’s irritation to a ready excuse. In fact, she might even
find some way to see such foibles as signs of Harry’s acceptance
and love, a motivated reconstrual of the evidence (e.g., “If Harry
grumbles, he’s just showing he can be himself around me”). If
Sally generally feels less valued by Harry, however, she may have
difficulty attributing such negative events to some specific feature
of the situation, such as Harry’s fatigue. Instead, Sally may attribute such grumbling to an interpersonal disposition— his
broader displeasure with her (e.g., “If Harry grumbles, he’s upset
with me”).
We find evidence for these differential appraisal processes in
both the daily diary study and prior experimental research. In the
daily diary study, married intimates who generally felt less positively regarded by their spouse read decidedly more rejectionrelated meanings into negative situations than did intimates who
generally felt more positively regarded (Murray, Bellavia, et al.,
2003). For instance, people who generally felt less valued by their
partner felt more rejected on days after their partner had simply
been in a worse than average mood, a mood that had nothing to do
with them or the relationship. Such sensitivity to rejection was not
at all characteristic of people who generally felt more positively
regarded. Instead, they actually recruited more feelings of being
loved and accepted by their partner on days after they reported
more than their usual amount of conflict or negative partner
behavior (and thus had greater actual reason to distrust their
partner’s availability and responsiveness).11
Dating intimates who are low in self-esteem overinterpret their
dating partner’s hypothetical negative moods, seeing them as
symptomatic of their partner’s ill feelings toward them (Bellavia &
Murray, 2003). Low but not high self-esteem participants react to
experimentally induced signs of a partner’s irritation by anticipating rejection (Murray, Rose, et al., 2002). Similarly, dating intimates who are high on attachment-related anxiety about acceptance (and are likely to question their specific partner’s
acceptance) interpret a partner’s hypothetical (Collins, 1996) and
actual misdeeds in suspicious ways that are likely to exacerbate
hurt feelings (Mikulincer, 1998; Simpson, Rholes, & Phillips,
1996). People who are high on attachment-related anxiety even
interpret a partner’s ambiguous attempts to be supportive as intentionally hurtful (Collins & Feeney, 2004). They also interpret daily
conflicts as a sign of their partner’s waning commitment (L.
Campbell et al., 2005). When gauging their dating partner’s
thoughts about attractive opposite sex others, intimates who are
high on attachment-related anxiety are also more empathically
accurate, discerning threatening thoughts that are misunderstood

by secure intimates (Simpson et al., 1999). People who anticipate
interpersonal rejection attribute negative intent to a new partner’s
hypothetical behaviors (Downey & Feldman, 1996). In marriage,
people who are less trusting of their partner’s responsiveness react
to reminders of past transgressions by perceiving more hurtful
intent in their partner’s discussion of a current problem. In contrast, people who are more trusting react to past transgressions by
seeing their partner’s current motivations more positively than
controls (Holmes & Rempel, 1989).

Summary
The evidence reviewed suggests that feeling more or less positively regarded by one’s partner moderates the sensitivity of the
appraisal contingencies that are activated in specific situations. For
people who generally feel less valued, situations of dependence
activate self-protective “if–then” contingencies that link vulnerability to rejection anxiety. However, for people who generally feel
more valued, situations of dependence activate relationshippromotive “if–then” contingencies that link such vulnerability to
bolstered perceptions of acceptance.

Individual Differences in Self-Esteem Sensitivity
Contingencies
The signaling system generally operates to detect discrepancies
between current and desired appraisals of a partner’s regard,
thereby mobilizing energy for action (Path B in Figure 1). For
people who generally feel less valued by their partner, detecting
drops in acceptance poses a greater proportional loss to a limited
resource. For them, the signal conveyed by this rule needs to be
especially strong (Path J in Figure 2). Relative to people who feel
more positively regarded, people who feel less valued should be
hurt more readily, questioning their worth in the face of perceived
rejections (i.e., “if feeling acutely rejected, then internalize”).
Differential state sensitivities to rejection have emerged in both
the daily diary study and experimental research. In the diary study,
global perceptions of the spouse’s regard determined how much
daily concerns about a partner’s rejection deflated state self-esteem
(Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). People who generally felt less
positively regarded by their partner felt worse about themselves on
days after they experienced a greater than usual level of anxiety
about their partner’s acceptance (as compared with low-anxiety
days). In contrast, for people who generally felt more positively
regarded, one day’s anxieties about acceptance did not turn into the
next day’s self-doubts. In a conceptually parallel experiment, low
but not high self-esteem dating intimates responded to induced
fears that their partner perceived important faults in them by
questioning their own self-worth (Murray, Rose, et al., 2002,
Experiment 3).
The combination of greater appraisal and self-esteem sensitivity
to rejection for people who generally feel less valued by their
partner raises an interesting paradox. Namely, why are they so
willing to perceive rejection if it is so hurtful? As we argued
11
Murray, Bellavia, et al. (2003) found no significant variability between people in their tendencies to draw inferences about acceptance or
rejection from daily relationship-related positive events.

<-----Page 14----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

earlier, it is precisely the fact that rejection is more hurtful that
makes lows more susceptible to perceiving rejection. In approaching their relationships, people who feel less valued may be attuned
for signs of potential rejection so they might avoid even more
hurtful situations in the future (MacDonald & Leary, 2005). Given
a minimal level of interdependence, such avoidance attempts are
not likely to be wholly successful, however. Prior research on
prevention motivations suggests that such ironic effects are quite
likely to occur. For instance, people who are motivated to avoid
negative outcomes (people who are high on behavioral inhibition)
are no more successful in avoiding negative events than people
who are low on such motivations, despite the fact that people who
are high on avoidance motivation react more emotionally when
such events occur (Gable, Reis, & Elliot, 2000).
The existing data suggest that feeling more or less positively
regarded by one’s partner moderates the sensitivity of the signaling
rule. For people who feel less positively regarded by their partner,
detecting rejection poses a greater proportional loss of an impoverished resource, heightening the need for a self-protective rule
system that clearly signals the costs of dependence. Consequently,
feeling rejected in specific situations hurts and diminishes selfesteem to a greater degree for people who already feel less valued
by their partner.

Individual Differences in Dependence Regulation
Contingencies
The behavioral response rule system operates to minimize the
likelihood and pain of rejection by only allowing people to risk as
much future dependence as feels safe given recent experience
(Path C in Figure 1). For people who generally feel less positively
regarded, perceiving acute rejections should activate the goal of
self-protection and the desire to reduce dependence (Path K in
Figure 2). For people who feel more positively regarded, perceiving acute rejections should activate the goal of promoting dependence and connectedness.

If Feeling Acutely Rejected, Then Decrease Dependence
The existing evidence suggests that people who feel less valued
by their partner do indeed respond to perceived rejections by
reducing dependence. In the daily diary study (Murray, Bellavia, et
al., 2003), people who generally felt less positively regarded
responded to feeling acutely rejected by their partner one day by
treating their partner in more cold, critical, and negative ways the
next day. For lows, feeling rejected activated the behavioral contingency “distance myself from my partner.” These reactions
emerged even though the partners of people who felt less valued
were not actually upset with them when the people felt most
rejected. Instead, people who felt less valued responded to an
imagined rejection by treating their partner badly.
Conceptual replications of these dynamics are evident in experimental and field research. People who are likely to doubt their
partner’s acceptance by virtue of their disposition react to feeling
rejected in specific situations in ways that minimize dependence.
People with low self-esteem respond to induced anxieties about
their partner’s possible rejection by depending less on their partner
as a source of self-esteem and comfort (Murray et al., 1998). They
also evaluate their partner’s qualities more negatively (Murray et

655

al., 1998; Murray, Rose, et al., 2002). The need to downplay the
value and importance of the partner (the source of the hurt) is
sufficiently powerful that derogation effects emerge on the qualities that typically reveal people’s positive illusions about their
partner (Murray et al., 1996b). These devaluing processes also
emerge whether these acute rejection anxieties are imagined in
response to a newly discovered fault in the self (Murray et al.,
1998) or arise in response to the partner’s behavior (Murray, Rose,
et al., 2002). Such devaluing efforts appear in part to be automatic,
as they also surface on implicit measures of partner regard (De
Hart, Pelham, & Murray, 2004). Low self-esteem people evaluate
their partner’s name letters less favorably the more difficulties they
currently perceive in their relationships. By diminishing their
partner’s value, people who feel less valued give their partner less
power to hurt them in the future by making the partner a less
important source of need satisfaction and a less valued informant
on their general worthiness of love and connection.
Research by other scholars further illustrates the model’s contention that risky situations activate distancing attempts for people
who generally feel less valued by a specific partner. Women who
are higher in attachment-related anxiety display greater anger
toward their partner in a situation in which their partner might not
have been as responsive as they hoped (Rholes, Simpson, & Orina,
1999). After discussing a serious relationship problem, more anxiously attached men and women also reported greater anger and
hostility (as compared with controls, who discussed a minor problem), and they downplayed their feelings of closeness and commitment (Simpson et al., 1996). To the extent that expressions of
anger are a means of trying to control the partner’s behavior, such
sentiment both directly and indirectly reduces dependence.
Intimates who were high on attachment-related anxiety also
reported feeling less close to their partner in a situation in which
they accurately inferred the (threatening) content of their partner’s
thoughts about attractive opposite sex others (Simpson et al.,
1999). When dating men in this study were both high on
attachment-related anxiety and empathically accurate, their relationships were at the greatest risk of dissolution (Simpson et al.,
1999). People who are high on attachment-related anxiety also
react to higher levels of daily conflict by minimizing their feelings
of closeness to their partner (L. Campbell et al., 2005). As another
example, women who are chronically high on rejection sensitivity
respond to a potential partner’s disinterest by evaluating that
partner more negatively (Ayduk et al., 1999). Rejection-sensitive
women are also more likely to initiate conflicts on days after they
felt more rejected by their romantic partner, and simply priming
rejection-related words automatically activates hostility-related
thoughts for these women (Ayduk et al., 1999).

If Feeling Acutely Rejected, Then Increase Dependence
For people who generally feel more positively regarded, feeling
acutely rejected activates “if–then” contingencies that link situations of dependence to relationship-promotion goals. Such
dependence-increasing contingencies emerged in the diary sample
and in experimental research. Intimates who generally felt more
positively regarded actually drew closer to their partner on days
after they felt most rejected, a relationship-promotive response
(Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003). Similarly, dating intimates who
tend to feel more positively regarded by virtue of higher global

<-----Page 15----->656

MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

self-esteem respond to induced concerns about their dating partner’s likely annoyance with them by reporting greater feelings of
closeness to that same partner (Murray, Rose, et al., 2002, Experiment 2). For highs, feeling rejected activated a behavioral contingency “draw closer.” Dating intimates who are high in global
self-esteem also react to experimentally induced self-doubts by
reporting greater dependence on their partner’s reassurance as a
source of self-esteem (Murray et al., 1998). Similarly, people who
are low on attachment-related anxiety come to value their partner
more after discussing a serious conflict than after discussing a
minor conflict (Simpson et al., 1996). Such relationship-promotive
tendencies even extend to situations in which a partner is attracted
to another. Intimates who are low on attachment-related anxiety
feel closer to their partner the more accurate they are in discerning
their partner’s attraction to opposite sex others (Simpson et al.,
1999).

Summary
The literature reviewed suggests that feeling more or less positively regarded by a partner moderates or controls the activation
of specific dependence regulation contingencies. For people who
feel less positively regarded, specific rejection experiences activate
self-protective “if–then” contingencies that link the restoration of
assurance to decreased dependence. For people who feel more
positively regarded, specific rejections activate relationshippromotive “if–then” contingencies that link the restoration of
assurance to increased dependence.12

Alternative Explanations for the Moderating Effects of
Perceived Regard
The findings reviewed suggest that feeling less positively regarded by a specific partner sensitizes people to the prospect of
rejection and the potential for hurt and loss, activating “if–then”
contingency rules that favor self-protection goals. In contrast,
generally feeling more positively regarded sensitizes people to the
benefits of closeness, activating “if–then” contingency rules that
favor relationship-promotion goals. Alternative conceptual explanations for these effects exist, however. We address three salient
possibilities.
The first alternative is that people who feel less positively
regarded may not be sensitized to rejection. Instead, they might
possess partners who value them less and behave in ways that
warrant greater concerns about rejection. However, the appraisal,
signaling, and dependence regulation effects observed in the diary
study remained when the authors controlled for the partner’s actual
regard and behavior (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003).
The second alternative centers around the influence of generalized as opposed to specific expectations of acceptance (Holmes &
Cameron, 2005). The literature reviewed suggests that both dispositional insecurities, such as low self-esteem or chronic attachment
anxiety, and specific insecurities about a partner’s regard sensitize
people to drawing rejection-related inferences, sensitize people to
internalizing rejection, and motivate people to respond to feeling
rejected by distancing. We interpret this convergence as evidence
for the importance of partner-specific expectations, as even generalized measures capture specific expectations of acceptance. The

alternative possibility is that the apparent moderating effect of
feeling valued by a specific partner might better reflect the moderating effect of more generalized representations.
Further analyses of the data reported by Murray, Bellavia, et al.
(2003) revealed that chronic attachment-related anxiety did shape
appraisal and dependence regulation contingencies. People who
were higher on attachment-related anxiety were more likely to feel
rejected on days after conflicts or days after they perceived a
moody or ill-behaved spouse. They were also more likely to
respond to feeling rejected one day by behaving in a more
negative, rejecting way toward their partner on subsequent
days. However, an independent effect of partner-specific expectations emerged beyond the effect of such generalized attachment expectations.
The third possibility is that people who feel less valued behave
badly in response to feeling hurt not to self-protect but to retaliate.
If retaliation is the primary motivation, we should find the most
evidence of dependence regulation in situations in which the
partner is actually behaving badly. Also, the punishment should in
some sense fit the crime. However, people with low self-esteem
respond to doubts about their own intelligence (and the anticipated
rejection these doubts activate) by devaluing their partner (Murray
et al., 1998). Such partner derogation effects emerge in the partner’s absence (Murray et al., 1998; Murray, Rose, et al., 2002) and
on measures of implicit partner regard (DeHart et al., 2004).
Married intimates who feel less valued also respond to feeling
rejected by treating their partner badly when nothing in their
partner’s behavior should have elicited such treatment (Murray,
Bellavia, et al., 2003). In making the point that these actions are
not necessarily retaliative, we are not disputing the evidence that
feeling rejected primes aggressive impulses (Twenge et al., 2001).
Instead, rather than being an end in itself, such aggressive acts may
represent an overlearned means of reducing dependence.
A related possibility is that people who feel less valued might
behave negatively toward their partner in response to acute hurts
not to distance themselves but as an attempt to elicit reassurance
and draw closer to their partner (i.e., protest behavior). If people
who feel less valued are trying to draw closer, they should show
signs of behavioral ambivalence. However, married intimates who
felt less valued were no more likely to respond to feeling hurt by
engaging in more positive behaviors toward their partner (Murray,
Bellavia, et al., 2003). In a variety of experiments, low self-esteem
participants showed no sign of responding to rejection by evaluating their partner more positively (Murray et al., 1998; Murray,
Rose, et al., 2002). The evidence just reviewed also demonstrates
that people who feel less valued respond to rejection with anger
and hostility.

The proposed model contends that people who feel less valued react
to acute hurts by minimizing dependence to blunt the pain of future
rejections. However, one could argue that people withdraw from a partner
not to minimize the partner’s value but to minimize the likelihood of doing
something that might further undermine the partner’s regard (Leary &
Baumeister, 2000). As people are behaving in ways that put them at risk of
eliciting a partner’s annoyance, the motivation to blunt the pain of future
rejections is likely to be the more pressing one, at least in this context.

<-----Page 16----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

Applications of the Risk Regulation Model
In this section, we outline how conceptualizing a state of assurance or “felt security” in terms of people’s means of resolving
conflicts between self-protection and relationship-promotion goals
can help resolve three enduring issues in the close relationships
area.

Procedural Markers of Relationship Resilience
The holy grail of close relationships research is determining
which relationships are likely to thrive and which are likely to fail.
What metrics might make such discriminations? The most common metric involves comparing the relationship outcomes of people who differ in their amount or level of a particular construct—a
person-centered approach (Karney & Bradbury, 1995). For instance, people’s mean levels of support provision might be used to
predict relationship outcomes. The current analysis of the risk
regulation system points to an alternative metric. A correlation
tapping people’s tendency to provide greater support in situations
in which their partner expresses more or less need might better
predict relationship outcomes.
The current model assumes that a relationship’s ultimate fate
rests in the nature of the “if–then” contingencies that people adopt
to negotiate interdependent situations (Paths L through N in Figure
2). Because the authors examined couples across situations, the
diary study (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al.,
2003) afforded a means for obtaining indexes of the “if–then”
contingencies implicit in each person’s relationship representations. For instance, the size and direction of the within-person
correlation or slope linking one day’s self-doubts to changes in the
next day’s expectations of partner acceptance provide one index of
how a person’s online appraisal system is calibrated (i.e., a selfevent-driven appraisal rule, Path L). In this case, more positive
slopes (predicting acceptance from self-esteem) reflect people’s
implicit assumption that the partner is more accepting when their
personal qualities warrant it.
The size and direction of the within-person correlation or slope
linking one day’s level of rejection anxiety to changes in selfesteem the next day tap a person’s level of self-esteem sensitivity
to rejection (Path M). In this case, more negative slopes (linking
rejection anxiety to self-esteem) reflect the operation of a more
sensitive signaling system. In terms of the contingency rules that
regulate dependence (Path N), the nature of the slope linking one
day’s rejection anxiety to the next day’s level of negative behavior
toward the partner taps one index of each person’s tendency to
respond to feeling rejected by minimizing dependence (i.e., a
self-protective dependence regulation rule). In contrast, the nature
of the slope linking one day’s rejection anxiety to the next day’s
willingness to provide support or the next day’s feelings of closeness to the partner taps possible indexes of each person’s tendency
to respond to feeling rejected by increasing dependence (i.e., a
relationship-promotive dependence regulation rule).
A 1-year follow-up on the married sample that participated in
the daily diary study reported by Murray, Griffin, et al. (2003)
revealed promising support for the idea that the fate of relationships may rest in part in how people regulate the tension between
self-protection and relationship-promotion motives on a day-today basis (Paths L through N in Figure 2). Relationship difficulties

657

were more likely to arise when people’s online systems for appraising rejection threats were calibrated in a more self-protective
fashion. When women linked their own personal self-doubts to
their husband’s lessened acceptance, their husband reported relatively greater declines in satisfaction over time (Murray, Griffin, et
al., 2003). When women both felt less valued by their husband and
linked personal successes at work to their husband’s acceptance
and failures to rejection, their husband also became more distressed over time (Murray, Griffin, Rose, & Bellavia, 2006). Conversely, when women compensated for self-doubts by embellishing their partner’s acceptance, their husband reported relatively
greater satisfaction (Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). Relationship
difficulties were also more likely to arise over time when people’s
signaling systems were more sensitive to rejection. When people
reacted to anxieties about rejection by reporting diminished selfesteem the next day, their partner reported significantly greater
declines in satisfaction. Finally, when women’s behavioral response to feeling rejected was to reduce dependence, their husband’s satisfaction declined. The more women reacted to felt
rejection by behaving negatively on subsequent days, the greater
was the decline in their husband’s satisfaction (Murray, Griffin, et
al., 2003).
The longitudinal costs of self-protective contingency rules
emerged even in analyses in which Murray, Griffin, et al. (2003)
controlled for the mean levels of the self-related affect or behavior
in question, which suggests that the fate of people’s relationships
really may rest in the mental and behavioral “if–then” associations
they form to deal with specific situations of dependence and
vulnerability. The effects of these subtle “if–then” contingencies in
shaping the future of these marriages are all the more impressive
given the difficulty of predicting changes in satisfaction with
considerably more obvious indicators (Karney & Bradbury, 1995).
In summary, when intimates put self-protection ahead of relationship promotion, it seems to set the stage for interactions that
ultimately undermine relationship well-being.

Why Seeking Acceptance Can Sometimes Make Finding It
Less Likely
It is one of the enduring ironies of life that people who want
something more are often less likely to find it. This same irony
riddles romantic life: People who are low in self-esteem or insecure in attachment style are less likely to find lasting happiness in
relationships even though they need this resource the most (Collins
& Read, 1990; Hendrick, Hendrick, & Adler, 1988). The salient
explanation for such effects is that people troubled by dispositional
insecurities pick worse partners who are less likely to be valuing of
them. This is not the case. The association between spouses’
self-esteem levels is near zero (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000).
Moreover, cross-sectional data reveal that people express just as
much love for low self-esteem partners as they do for high selfesteem partners (Murray et al., 2001). People also see low selfesteem partners more positively than they see themselves (Murray
et al., 1996a). Why do people troubled by self-doubt end up in
relationships that both partners find less satisfying?
The nature of interdependence is such that hurts at the hands of
a partner are inevitable. Because people troubled by dispositional
insecurities are likely to doubt their partner’s regard (Downey &
Feldman, 1996; Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000; Tucker &

<-----Page 17----->658

MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

Anders, 1999), they are not likely to respond to such interdependence dilemmas in ways that promote the relationship. Instead,
they are likely to see the slightest offense as rejection and be
motivated to self-protect.
Therefore, the desire to reduce dependence and minimize the
pain of rejection in the short term could have the unintended
consequence of making partner rejection more likely (Paths L
through N in Figure 2). For instance, on days after rejectionsensitive women felt rejected by their dating partner, their partner
also reported greater dissatisfaction, even though their partner had
not been upset initially (Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri,
1998). In the Murray, Bellavia, et al. (2003) study, people with a
partner who felt less valued came to see their partner as being more
selfish and unappreciative on days after their partner had felt most
rejected, even though they had not been upset with their partner in
the first place. In such ways, self-protective attempts to blunt the
likelihood and pain of rejection eventually alienate one’s partner.
In fact, intimates in dating relationships come to regard low
self-esteem partners less favorably over time and ultimately report
less satisfaction themselves (Murray et al., 1996b).
By putting self-protection at a greater premium than relationship
promotion, people who feel less positively regarded may create
long-term interpersonal realities that defeat their hopes and confirm their fears. Repeated experiences with a partner who reads too
much into relatively mundane problems and lashes out in return
may then set the stage for cycles of negative affect and behavior
that are the hallmark of marital distress (Gottman, 1994).
Unfortunately, the potential for such patterns to develop is not
likely to be part of the consciousness of a person caught in the
immediate experience of trying to blunt the short-term pain of a
perceived rejection. People respond to experimentally induced
fears of lifelong rejection and social isolation by behaving in
self-defeating ways, putting short-term pleasures, such as making
risky gambles or unhealthy food choices, ahead of the long-term
costs of such endeavors (Twenge, Catanese, & Baumeister, 2002).
Induced rejection fears also undermine people’s scores on intelligence tests (Baumeister, Twenge, & Nuss, 2002), which suggests
that coping with rejection impairs the type of executive functioning necessary for effective self-regulation. For people who chronically doubt their partner’s regard, gauging and then responding to
perceived rejections may be sufficiently preoccupying that they
exhaust the self-regulatory resources needed to anticipate the costs
of self-protection (Finkel & Campbell, 2001).

Understanding Relationship Transitions
Although the nature of interdependence changes dramatically as
couples go from casual dating, to commitment, to shared childcare
responsibilities, close relationships scholars have paid little attention to how such structural changes could also change the basis for
relationship well-being and resilience. In particular, specific transition points in a relationship’s development are likely to heighten
people’s need for a protective sense of confidence in a partner’s
regard. Imagine the threat posed by the prospect of a relationship
becoming long distance or the stakes involved in deciding whether
to get engaged. These transition points necessitate at least some
deliberation about the costs and benefits of increasing one’s commitment, deliberations that are likely to highlight the possibility of
rejection and relationship loss. Consequently, people in this state

of mind might take a mental step back and try to evaluate their
relationship in a more balanced manner. However, once people
have put thoughts of rejection out of mind and made the decision
to deepen dependency, their psychological energies should be
geared toward finding ways to see their relationship in the best
possible light (e.g., Taylor & Gollwitzer, 1995).

Transition Points
Supporting this logic is the fact that people make more accurate
forecasts about the future fate of their relationships when they are
deliberating about an important relationship decision than when
they are thinking about how to implement an already made decision (Gagne & Lydon, 2001a). These effects emerge because
people in a deliberative mind-set consider both the positive and the
negative features of the partner and relationship in making their
predictions, whereas people in an implemental mind-set focus only
on the positive. Put in terms of risk regulation processes, people in
a deliberative mind-set may be more evenhanded precisely because such deliberations sensitize them to the possibility of rejection and the need for caution. If this is the case, thinking in a
deliberative way should be less threatening and engender less need
for caution for people who generally trust in their partner’s availability and responsiveness. Consistent with this analysis, people
who are high in commitment to their partner respond to the threat
implicit in deliberating about the relationship by evaluating their
partner more positively (Gagne & Lydon, 2001b). Such defensive
reactions do not emerge for people who are less committed.

Recalibrating the Risk Regulation System
Events and transitions of sufficient magnitude should also have
the potential to recalibrate the risk regulation system, shifting
people’s means of maintaining a sense of invulnerability to harm.
Recalibration in people’s “if–then” rules then may change more
general levels of confidence in the partner’s regard by altering
levels of dependence in ways that either increase or decrease a
partner’s capacity to provide actual evidence of caring.
In the first 2 years following marriage, newlyweds report less
chronic anxiety about abandonment and greater comfort depending
on others (Davila, Karney, & Bradbury, 1999). Given the assurance afforded by a publicly recognized commitment, even people
who have been uncertain of their partner’s regard may entertain
more optimistic expectations of acceptance. These heightened
feelings of confidence might temporarily desensitize them to the
risks of dependence, altering the “if–then” contingencies underlying the appraisal system. In the light of Sally’s new commitment,
her criticisms about Harry’s weight may not be troubling to him.
Desensitized to Sally’s criticism in this domain, Harry might
become more willing to brush off Sally’s perceived transgressions
in other domains. If forgiving Sally’s transgression has positive
consequences for Harry, such positive experiences might, in turn,
lessen Harry’s need for a sensitive signaling system. He might then
be willing to risk entering into new situations of dependence. His
once chronic doubts about Sally’s regard might then begin to abate
because he has given Sally more opportunities to demonstrate
caring. In such ways, the graded activation of relationshippromotive “if–then” contingencies could bolster confidence in a
partner’s regard.

<-----Page 18----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

In contrast, marital roles become increasingly traditional over
the transition to parenthood, and women are likely to shoulder
more than their fair share of the burden for childcare and household tasks (Grote & Clark, 2001; Hackel & Ruble, 1992). Given
the stress of this transition, most women may question their husband’s capacity to meet their needs. Even if Sally generally had
felt confident of Harry’s regard in the past, this transition might
trigger the operation of a self-protective appraisal system (Holmes,
1981). In the domains of housework and childcare, Sally might
begin to appraise events in ways that draw her attention to inequities. Although she once overlooked Harry’s failure to tend to the
dishes, such episodes might now activate concerns about his responsiveness (e.g., “If my partner doesn’t help me, he doesn’t
care”). Such sensitivity to perceiving rejection in this domain
might then spill into others. Accumulated instances of perceived
nonresponsiveness might then heighten Sally’s need to be wary of
situations in which she might be hurt, leaving her self-esteem more
dependent on Harry’s actions. Sally’s greater self-esteem sensitivity might then motivate her to avoid situations in which Harry
might be insensitive to her plight, effectively limiting his opportunities to demonstrate his caring. The erosion of Harry and Sally’s
marriage may be evident in a sequence whereby appraisal rules
first become sensitized to rejection, signaling rules then become
amplified, and dependence regulation rules finally become selfprotective. In such ways, the graded activation of self-protective
“if–then” rules could erode Sally’s confidence in Harry’s caring
for her.

A Theoretical Integration
Apart from its utility as a heuristic tool for addressing applied
problems, the risk regulation model offers a means of integrating
the assumptions of the sociometer model (Leary & Baumeister,
2000), the relational schemas approach (Andersen & Chen, 2002;
Baldwin, 1992), attachment theory (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003),
and interdependence theory (Holmes, 2002). By focusing on the
interdependence dilemmas implicit in adult romantic relationships,
the proposed model adds further richness to these theoretical
perspectives.

The Sociometer Model
The conceptualization of perceived regard as an arbiter that
estimates and summarizes rejection risk coincides with many
aspects of the sociometer model of self-esteem (Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Leary & MacDonald, 2003; Leary et al., 1995). Both
perspectives assume that people are motivated to feel positively
regarded and valued by others. Both perspectives also assume that
social relationships are most likely to be satisfying and stable when
people respond to signs of rejection by behaving in ways that put
connectedness at a premium.
However, the present conceptualization of the interrelation between self-esteem and connectedness motivations differs from the
sociometer model. These motivations are largely isomorphic in the
sociometer model. When the threat of rejection is salient, establishing connection represents the primary means of having one’s
needs for approval met, thereby restoring a sense of esteem in
one’s relational value.

659

In the unique context of an adult close relationship, these motivations are more separable and, consequently, sometimes in
conflict. As most people possess one romantic partner at a time,
this person has special power in satisfying (or thwarting) people’s
capacity to meet important needs and goals. Such outcome control
makes a romantic partner a uniquely powerful informant on one’s
worthiness of interpersonal connection. Consequently, people are
likely concerned about more than just minimizing the actual potential for rejection (as in the sociometer model). Instead, preemptively minimizing the pain of rejection if it were to occur is also an
important goal. For these interrelated reasons, the present model
assumes that people actively regulate their sense of connection to
this specific other—letting a partner become a valued and important source of need satisfaction when the potential for rejection
seems low. In contrast, minimizing the partner’s value may be the
best means of discounting the meaning of unresponsive behaviors
when people are less sure of another’s acceptance. In so doing,
people can protect a symbolic sense of connection to others without the cooperation of specific others (in the short term).
The integration of the sociometer and risk regulation models
may rest in the possibility that people may possess multiple sociometers, ones that vary in their generality and, thus, in their
likelihood of being activated in specific contexts (see Kirkpatrick
& Ellis, 2001). At the highest level of generality, global selfesteem might operate as a default. This sociometer might forecast
the likelihood of acceptance and regulate affect and behavior in
situations with strangers or casual friends (Leary et al., 1995;
Nezlek et al., 1997). Perceptions of a partner’s regard might
operate as a lower level sociometer. This gauge might forecast the
likelihood of acceptance and regulate behavior with one specific
relationship. This lower level sociometer also might operate in
ways that guard against losses to the operating level of the general
sociometer. In this light, people who generally feel less valued by
their partner may distance themselves from a rejecting partner to
protect a more general sense of their worthiness of interpersonal
connection.

Relational Schemas and Relational Selves
The current model shares several points of emphasis with recent
social– cognitive analyses of relational schemas (Andersen &
Chen, 2002; Baldwin, 1992). Baldwin (1992) argued that people
develop relational schemas through past experiences with others
that help them navigate their social worlds. These schemas include
declarative beliefs about the characteristics of the self in specific
contexts, beliefs about the characteristics of others in these same
contexts, and “if–then” interpersonal scripts that specify the relation between the self and others (e.g., “If I depend on my spouse
for support, he or she will be comforting”). Similarly, Andersen
and Chen (2002) argued that accessible ties exist in memory
between aspects of people’s self-conceptions and representations
of specific significant others. Consequently, signs of a significant
other’s qualities in a new acquaintance can activate the significant
other representation through a process of transference. This activation can then shift people’s self-concepts to match those selfaspects experienced in the presence of the significant other (e.g.,
Hinkley & Andersen, 1996).
Both of these theoretical perspectives share points of emphasis
with the model we have presented. These perspectives assume that

<-----Page 19----->MURRAY, HOLMES, AND COLLINS

660

people are motivated to establish secure ties to others and that
people’s sense of themselves is shaped by their expectations about
the orientation of specific significant others toward them. These
perspectives also assume that the declarative and procedural aspects of people’s working models shape social inference and
behavior.
The current model advances thinking about relational schemas
because it identifies three general “if–then” contingency rules and
describes how they develop across situations of dependence. The
model also differs in its conceptualization of self-schemas and
their relation to schemas of specific others. A relational schemas
approach assumes that the content of people’s working selfconcepts shifts to accommodate whatever audience is most salient.
For instance, Harry may think of himself as a leader in his dealings
with his office subordinates but as egalitarian in his equal-status
interactions with his wife Sally because the model of other that is
activated in each context primes a different aspect of his selfconcept. The current model assigns greater causal priority to the
reflected aspects of people’s self-schemas, such as Harry’s perception of how much Sally values his skills. In this model, people’s reflected image of themselves shapes the goals they adopt in
specific situations because such self-schemas afford more or less
optimistic inferences about another’s likely responsiveness to the
self. The present model further suggests that models of self then
dynamically shape people’s models of others.

Attachment Theory
The current model resonates with many aspects of attachment
theory (see Fraley & Shaver, 2000; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003, for
reviews). Both perspectives assume that assessments of an attachment figure’s availability and responsiveness determine the strategies people adopt to restore a psychological sense of safety in
threatening situations. Both perspectives also assume that understanding people’s sensitivity to rejection-related cues and strategic
responses to feeling rejected is critical in determining the relationship’s current welfare and future stability. Both perspectives also
assume that people’s capacity to forge satisfying adult relationships rests in part on the expectations that develop in formative
relationships.
The current conceptualization of the nature of the relation between working models of self and other presents a different twist
on attachment theory. Attachment theorists generally argue that the
systems that detect rejection threats operate largely independently
of the systems that respond to such threats (Bartholomew, 1990;
Fraley & Shaver, 2000; Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994; but see
Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003, for a recent exception). Fraley and
Shaver (2000) argued that attachment-related anxiety governs the
appraisal or threat detection system, whereas attachment-related
avoidance governs the system regulating behavioral responses to
threat. As these systems are thought to be independent in principle,
people can express strong fears of rejection and strong desires for
closeness (i.e., preoccupied) or few anxieties about rejection and
strong desires for distance (i.e., dismissing).
The proposed model contends that the “if–then” rules that
sensitize people to perceiving and internalizing a partner’s rejection must be connected to the “if–then” rules that dull the impact
of such threats if people are to sustain feelings of assurance. In
other words, people are not likely to see qualities in a specific other

that would elicit proximity seeking unless they can first find reason
to trust in that specific other’s regard. Thus, the current model
suggests that models of specific others are likely to be contingent
on expectations of acceptance. It also suggests that generalized
expectations about one’s worthiness of love and the trustworthiness of others—aspects of working models that have often been
conceptualized as independent—might have common effects mediated through the specific beliefs they foster about a partner’s
regard. Thus, both anxiety and avoidance might regulate people’s
willingness to risk dependence.13
Consistent with the risk regulation model, generalized
attachment-related anxiety and avoidance are equally detrimental
to feeling positively regarded by one’s partner (Holmes & Cameron, 2005). When anxiety and avoidance are viewed as statements
about the partner’s anticipated responsiveness, the behaviors associated with preoccupied and dismissing styles also take on a
different meaning. Both hyperactivating behaviors, such as expressing hostility or controlling the partner, and deactivating behaviors, such as immersing oneself in work, may resolve the
tension between self-protection and relationship-promotion goals.
Both of these classes of behavior reduce one’s dependence on the
partner’s good will. For instance, by demanding more of Harry’s
attention, Sally may be trying to reduce the likelihood that he will
act in ways that are not sufficiently attentive to her needs (Holmes
& Rempel, 1989).
To take this logic one step further, we note that the ultimate
effect of people’s general expectations about themselves and others may be modified by people’s partner-specific beliefs (see
Collins, Guichard, Ford, & Feeney, 2004). If that is the case,
people who are troubled by dispositional vulnerabilities may respond adaptively to threat if they believe their partner sees qualities in them that merit attention, nurturance, and care. Consistent
with this logic, secure base schemas— expectations of responsive
and loving care— can be activated even for people who are insecure in attachment style (e.g., Mikulincer et al, 2000; Mikulincer,
Gillath, & Shaver, 2002). Similarly, women who are high in
attachment anxiety who nonetheless believe that their partner will
be responsive during the transition to parenthood remain satisfied
in their marriage during this stressful time. The opposite is true
when anxious–ambivalent women do not feel valued by their
partner (Rholes, Simpson, Campbell, & Grich, 2001). People who
are high in attachment anxiety who nonetheless feel confident in a
partner’s acceptance also report better quality interactions in daily
life than people who possess pessimistic general and specific
expectations (Pierce & Lydon, 1998). Further research along these
lines has the potential to enrich both attachment and risk regulation
perspectives.

Interdependence Theory
The current model’s emphasis on the diagnostic nature of
situations that create a tension between self-protection and
relationship-promotion goals resonates with analyses that depict behavior as a function of the person and the situation
13
For this reason, we prefer the more generic term model of other to
avoidance. Avoidant behaviors or psychological distancing may stem from
either anxiety about rejection or doubts about others.

<-----Page 20----->RISK REGULATION IN RELATIONSHIPS

(Holmes, 2002; Kelley & Holmes, 2003; Kelley et al., 2003).
Mischel and Shoda (1995) argued that the essence of people’s
dispositions or personality rests in the contingencies that underlie the ways that they think, feel, and behave in similar
situations. Kelley and Holmes (2003) extended such an analysis
to adult close relationships. They argued that specific relationship situations differ in the substantive problems they present
and in the interpersonal dispositions that are relevant to solving
such problems. Thus, situations afford the activation of certain
interpersonal dispositions. For instance, in a situation in which
Harry and Sally need to coordinate divergent movie preferences, Harry’s trust in Sally may afford a cooperative choice on
Harry’s part, one that presumes Sally will also act to maximize
their joint interests. In interdependence theory terms, the nature
of people’s beliefs about their partner’s goals in such situations
shapes the goals people select (Holmes, 2002).
The current model shares assumptions that are fundamental to
both the Mischel and Shoda (1995) and the Kelley et al. (2003)
analyses. These perspectives both assume that social perception is
influenced both by features of the situation and by people’s expectations and goals. Both models also emphasize people’s expectations about their partner’s goals (Holmes, 2002). However, classic perspectives on interdependence assume that people develop
only situation-specific beliefs about their partner’s goals. The
proposed model assumes that people rely on general expectations
about their partner’s regard to predict their partner’s goals in
specific situations. These perspectives also assume that expectations or goals turn one kind of situation into another. The current
model focuses specifically on how people transform a situation
that has the possible risk of rejection into a situation that activates
the goal of being connected.

Conclusions and Future Directions
Of all the forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal
to true happiness.—Bertrand Russell, The Conquest of Happiness

Perhaps one of the greatest ironies of life is that the relationships
that have the most potential to satisfy adult needs for interpersonal
connection are the very relationships that activate the most anxiety
about rejection (Baumeister et al., 1993). Given the personal stakes
associated with narrowing social connections to focus on one
partner, some level of caution is required. However, to be happy
over the longer term, people need to set rejection concerns aside
and risk substantial dependence (Murray, 1999). The research
reviewed suggests that people are most likely to experience a
relationship as satisfying and fulfilling when they put seeking
connectedness ahead of minimizing the likelihood and pain of
rejection.
Aspects of this risk regulation system still require development
and research. The most important avenue for future research involves stipulating the content of the “if–then” rules underlying the
appraisal, signaling, and behavioral regulation systems. First, the
content of appraisal contingencies and how such contingencies
change over time require greater specification. For instance, early
in the relationship, signs of Harry’s irritation might activate the
general goal of relationship promotion for a secure Sally, motivating her to find some way of excusing this behavior. However, with
repeated experience, signs of Harry’s irritation might automatically activate specific beliefs about his patient nature.

661

Second, further specificity is also needed to delineate the specific “if–then” contingency rules that govern strategic attempts to
increase or decrease dependence. Most research has focused on
behaviors and thoughts that directly or indirectly diminish the
value of the partner’s contributions to the relationship. However,
people could also limit dependence by reducing their own inputs— by becoming less prosocial and willing to give of themselves to meet their partner’s needs. Examinations of the regulation
of the “if–then” contingencies surrounding caregiving (Feeney &
Collins, 2001) and communal norm adherence (Grote & Clark,
2001) present two critical avenues for study. Examining how
“if–then” contingencies change in their specificity and coherence
over time also presents an important task for future research. With
repeated experience, the generic goals of avoiding rejection or
increasing connection may be supplanted by a repertoire of specific behaviors that best fulfill such goals. In her first experiences
with conflicts, an insecure Sally might “try out” different means of
regulating a sense of assurance or safety. As some strategies prove
more effective than others, the types of behaviors that are linked to
such situations may become increasingly regimented.
Greater attention to issues of reciprocal causation and longitudinal change will further enhance the utility of this conceptual
model. One avenue involves stipulating how the “if–then” contingency rules a person adopts in a specific relationship affect his or
her general dispositions toward relationships. For instance, people
who react to feeling rejected by self-protecting may become more
generally avoidant of intimacy and closeness. A second avenue
involves demonstrating the interconnected operation of the risk
regulation system, including issues of mediation. The link between
the signaling and dependence regulation systems presents a ripe
avenue for research in this respect. In the short term, the acute
self-esteem sting of rejection may motivate dependence regulation.
Over time, dependence regulation responses may preempt such
consciously felt hurts from arising if specific situations trigger
active efforts at avoidance.
A third avenue involves further specifying the dyadic nature of
risk regulation processes. The huge majority of the existing research examines how people’s “individual” perceptions of their
relationships affect their contingency rules. However, the contingency rule one partner adopts must shape and influence the rules
adopted by the other partner. The evidence for self-fulfilling effects points to this possibility, but, with few exceptions, most
relationship scholars have not examined how each partner’s qualities combine to create a unique relationship personality (see
Swann, Rentfrow, & Gosling, 2003, for an exception). It is critical
to specify exactly how such couple effects emerge and shape how
risk regulation systems operate.
Further research might also profitably examine whether the
proposed model provides a template for understanding the dynamics inherent in nonromantic relationships. The dynamics we have
described should be most evident in relationships in which people
can choose how much dependence to risk and in which the value
of a particular other’s regard is not easily substituted. It is in these
situations that people should need the assurance provided by
specific expectations of caring. Consequently, dependence regulation dynamics might be more pronounced in relationships between
adult parents and children or between best friends (DeHart, Murray, Pelham, & Rose, 2003) than in relationships between casual
friends or coworkers.

Although the tension between self-protection and relationshippromotion goals is a fundamental undercurrent in interpersonal
life, this conflict has received little attention. Understanding the
regulating role played by confidence in a partner’s regard is likely
to have the practical benefit of increasing insight into both the
relational self and relationship resilience and the conceptual benefit of integrating diverse theoretical perspectives under one
umbrella.
