GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 5----->executive summary

1.1	 Why entrepreneurship? This analysis is designed to enhance
		

understanding of innovative and productive entrepreneurship that

		

can promote economic growth, job creation, sustainability, and

		

quality of life. The ‘ecology’ in which these entrepreneurs operate

		

is probed.

1.2	 Why GEM? Participation in GEM brings Canadian data into a rich
		

international context of policies and circumstances. Uniquely,

		

GEM paints a portrait of the individual entrepreneur;attitudes,

		

activities, and aspirations. In the second year of renewed

		

Canadian participation, some indications of changes over time can

		

be discussed.

ATTITUDES
2.1	 The Canadian environment and culture for entrepreneurship

1

		

is healthy. Entrepreneurship is seen as a good career for which

		

opportunities exist within the capacities of a large segment of

		

the population. Entrepreneurial success is widely admired.

		

Policy for entrepreneurial culture can be more sophisticated,

		

fostering innovative growth.

ACTIVITY
2.2	 Canada is a leader in early stage entrepreneurial activity with a
		

rate of 13.0, marginally up from 2013. This rate is just behind the

		

US and equal to Australia. It is well above the remainder of a

		

reference group that includes the G7 plus Singapore.

			 - Canadian entrepreneurs report opportunity as their
				 motivation much more often than necessity.
			 -	 Owner/managers of established business over 3.5 years old
				 represented 9.4% of respondents, also a value higher than
				 other countries except Australia.
			 -	 Intrapreneurship (employee entrepreneurship activity, EEA),
				 which leads development of a new activity for a principal
	 	

	 	 employer, is the weak spot in the Canadian profile.

				 Entrepreneurial activity among the currently employed (not
				 self-employed) is 7.0%, Canada’s rate is well below the US
				 or Australia. This is consistent with a number of studies from

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 6----->	 	

	 	 other points of view that see Canadian firms as weak

				 innovators lacking an innovation oriented strategy.

executive summary

			 -	 Social entrepreneurship, founding organizations or entities
	 	

	 	 with social, cultural, or environmental benefit is significant

				 (8.6% of population). Most of these entrepreneurs are not full
				 time engaged in the social enterprises.
			 -	 The stages of entrepreneurship: the entrepreneurial process
	 	

	 	 proceeds in five stages, not necessarily linearly. Canada data

	 	

	 	 are quoted for each as identified in the year’s survey.

				 Entrepreneurship begins from intentions (of respondents)
				 to early stage activity. Some become established businesses
				 after 3.5 years, and some close (a loss), and some owners sell
				 to new owners who continue the business (positive outcome).
				 Both are low in comparison to TEA, and in Canada the two
				 exit modes are similarly important. The excess of
				 start-ups over established businesses reminds us of the risks
				 of entrepreneurships.
2

ASPIRATIONS
2.3	 Signals of productive entrepreneurship and innovation are found
		

in a reasonable level of aspirations for growth and frequent

		

reporting of aspirations to introduce new products and to export.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE ECONOMY
3.1	 The new firms are classified in four sectors: extractive (e.g.
		

agriculture, mining), transformative (e.g. manufacturing),

		

business oriented services and consumer oriented services.

	 	

Canada has a lower share of firms in consumer services and a

		

larger share in business oriented services than the reference group

	 	

of countries. This suggests a sector profile more likely to

		

experience growth and produce innovations.

3.3	 New firms oriented to new markets and new products make an
	 	

up a significant share of TEA, indicating innovative activity. New

	 	

firms dependent on high or medium technology are not prominent

		

anywhere in the G7. The Canadian numbers are slightly better

		

than Australian and comparable to US numbers.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 7----->executive summary

3.4	 Case studies of ambitions for high job growth are reported to
		

illustrate that important, but rare, high impact phenomenon. One

		

of two project growth to the two thousand level.

DEMOGRAPHICS
4.1	 The age distribution of Canadian early stage entrepreneurship
		

is similar to the reference countries with a healthy rate of

		

entrepreneurship among the younger cohorts. This year the

		

peak for Canadian entrepreneurship has moved up to the 45 –

		

64 age group. As with other countries, there is a decline in the 55-

		

64 age group. Seniors (not surveyed in other countries) have a

		

low rate, but entrepreneurship does continue to be observed past

		

age seventy. With increase of senior populations, this category

		

should be tracked in future.

4.2	 Education attainment of early stage entrepreneur respondents

3

		

varies moderately from a respectable share in the ‘some secondary’

		

to somewhat less for ‘secondary diploma’. It rises with education,

		

with a peak among those with post graduate experience. It is

		

interesting that the frequency of the established business owner/

		

manager role increased smoothly with increasing education.

4.3	 TEA by gender was mentioned above. The ratio of male to female
		

(a bit more than 3/2) entrepreneurs is little changed from 2013.

		

Sector data show women are more active in consumer related

		

services than men. Initiatives are needed to broaden the

		

opportunities for women. For men the lead sector is business

		

oriented services.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SELECTED PROVINCES
There is significant variation among provinces. Alberta reports the
highest TEA and Quebec the highest intrapreneur, EEA, rate.

THE FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS FOR
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CANADA
The experts surveyed evaluated eighteen themes with four or more
statements to apprise in each on a five point scale from ‘completely
true’ (5) to ‘completely false’ (o). Each statement characterized a
condition favourable to entrepreneurship. Scores above three suggest
conditions in Canada are acceptable. Scores below three identify
problems. Scores for each of the major areas of framework condition
are shown in the figure described fully in Chapter 7.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
See the recommendations on the following page.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 9----->recommendations
Innovation. The low rate of initiatives by entrepreneurial
employees compared to peer countries is the major weakness
revealed in the population survey data. This is consistent
with studies that suggest larger Canadian firms do not adopt
innovation oriented business strategies. As Mazzucato14.
has shown, transformative innovation requires public sector
acceptance of leading risks, as has been done in Canada for
oil sands technology and aerospace. In Canada’s present
circumstances, major government initiatives for the growing
Canadian green technology sector are an opportunity at federal
and provincial levels.
Women entrepreneurs. Current data suggest no increased
share in early stage entrepreneurship by women. Efforts
should take into account that sector data suggests there may
already be more women entrepreneurs active in consumer
oriented services than men. Much of the gender gap may be
accounted for by lower rates of entry to sectors other than

5

consumer services. Measures to support women entrepreneurs
should remain a high priority. Greater breadth of Government
programs, illustrated by the federal Business Development
Bank and the regional economic development agencies, need
support for their mentoring activities and the capacity to
substantially assist scalable initiatives by women entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurship education. Interest in education for
entrepreneurship appears to be growing. Expert opinion is
sceptical, and still emphasizes more attention. The population
survey indicates a high level of confidence in having the
knowledge to start a firm. The attitude data suggests the
actions need not be oriented to increasing the attractions of
entrepreneurship. Indeed Canada’s TEA is high. However, the
expressed confidence may reflect lack of education.  The low
rates of employee entrepreneurship point to the need for a focus
on creative entrepreneurial thinking applicable within firms

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 10----->recommendations
and in broad social settings, going beyond business education
that equates entrepreneurship with new venture start-up.
Culture. As far as willingness to start-up is concerned,
Canada has a strong entrepreneurial culture, still experts have
concerns. As the recent OECD studies12,22 show, a relatively
small fraction of start-ups account of most of growth and a
substantial number of start-ups do not survive. It is hard to
pick winners, but as Shane19 argues it is easier to identify those
initiatives without growth aspirations. Support needs to be
directed to scalable initiatives.

1.1.	 WHY ENTREPRENEURSHIP?
CANADA, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND GEM
The concerns over growth and for employment that have been
expressed in GEM reports over the years are certainly as or more

that the present uncertain
economic situation

entrepreneurship policy. As

relevant now during a tepid recovery. To these two, we must
add concerns about sustainability and quality of life1. Broad
and convincing evidence2 shows that the scope and character of
entrepreneurship strongly influences all four of these goals for Canada.
As was the case in the 2013 report, the results of this GEM survey
document the fact that attitudes among a majority of Canadians remain
quite favourable to entrepreneurs. It is not necessary to persuade
Canadians that entrepreneurship is a good career or that its risks
are insurmountable. The focus of policy must be on quality growth
oriented entrepreneurship that can promote:
	 •	 Job creation,
	 •	Sustainability,
	 •	 Economic growth,
	 •	 ...and, in consequence, Quality of life.

7

There can be little doubt that the present uncertain economic situation
prioritizes implementation of evidence based entrepreneurship policy.
As well, future development (its extent and quality) requires attention
to a truly Canadian innovation policy. Finally, it is important to
acknowledge that in Canada; ‘intrapreneurship’ initiatives inside our
large and medium firms as well as social entrepreneurship to build our
communities are a priority too, and may be the weak point.
THE NATURE AND ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Entrepreneurship is defined in the GEM context as:
		 …“any attempt at new business or new venture creation, such

GEM Canada Report 2014

		

as self-employment, a new business organisation, or the

		

expansion of an existing business, by an individual, a team of

		

individuals, or an established business”3 (p.9).

<-----Page 12----->The GEM definition includes at least the following four areas of activity
that Steve Blank calls the ‘four pathways’ of entrepreneurship4:

1. Introduction

	 •	 Small business
	 •	 Scalable business
	 •	Intrapreneurship
	 •	 Social entrepreneurship
The first two are treated together in this report with emphasis on
the urge to grow. The latter two are treated in separate sections on
employee entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs. The goal all of these
processes is creation of value as emphasized in an OECD framework5.
The definition is expansive enough to include the champions of
all types of innovation, but a special place is reserved for those
entrepreneurs who create new establishments, businesses or other
ventures with prospects for growth, job creation, and impact.
It is well known that we live in a knowledge economy. Knowledge is
the economic good that does not degrade in use and few organizations
can effectively realise the full economic return on all of the knowledge

8

they possess6. This leads to the ‘spillovers’ that, for example, create
productive clustering for which the archetype is Silicon Valley. Among
the most productive forms of entrepreneurship is turning ‘spillover’
knowledge into breakthrough new ventures that escape and go beyond
the constraint on use of all the knowledge imposed on incumbent large
firms who must attend to ‘core businesses.
As the influential economist, William Baumol, pointed out7, there
are three types of entrepreneurship; productive, unproductive and
destructive. Productive entrepreneurship is that which has
growth potential and produces significant innovations. It yields
growth and quality of life benefit as well as jobs. Unproductive
entrepreneurship simply re-shuffles the locus of accumulation
of money. It includes, for example, opening imitative consumer
services businesses. Still, net employment may increase. Destructive
entrepreneurship, such as criminal inventiveness, is outside the
scope of GEM study. There is no rigid line between productive and
unproductive types; more realistically, it is a continuum with these as
the end points. Nevertheless, the main interest in entrepreneurship

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 13----->1. Introduction

study is the productive entrepreneurial process, which is the main
driver of long-term transformative growth. Much interest centres
on entrepreneurship and innovation. Much innovation analysis has
focused attention on R&D and technology. Yet it is clear that not all
innovation is derived from technical inventiveness. Think of Starbuck’s
coffee shops or the introduction of ‘Medicare’. In fact, analysis of
innovation shows that every success depends in large measure on nontechnical social factors. Hall and Martin8 point out that an innovation
must pass four hurdles: technical feasibility, commercial viability,
organizational capability, and social acceptability (not in a temporal
sequence). They argue that uncertainty increases as we pass along this
value-added chain from left to right. An entrepreneurial venture must
succeed at each stage. In most cases, the major challenges arise after
technical feasibility has been established.

intimate information. Every entrepreneur is a potential innovator,
since all initiatives grow out of some new idea. Most innovation
literature offers a firm based perspective. GEM brings the individual
initiator back into focus. The latest addition to GEM is questions
addresses activity within firms and identifies leaders in developing new
activities for a principal employer. This is designated intrapreneurship,
or employee entrepreneurship. It plays a large role in the creativity and
growth of established firms, especially larger ones.
As a complement, the framework environment that influences and
conditions entrepreneurial activity is assessed through the national
panel of experts in the National Experts Survey (NES).

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 14----->1.3.	 ENTREPRENEURSHIP, INNOVATION,
	
GROWTH – THE GEM MODEL9

1. Introduction

The interpretation of entrepreneurship from the central GEM
perspective focuses on the individual entrepreneur with personal
aspirations, capabilities and opportunities against an alternate
perspective focusing on human capital, policy, markets, finance
and culture. However, the GEM project regards entrepreneurship
as a process in a complex ecosystem and examines individual
entrepreneurs and ventures in the context of this ecosystem and
the social factors that shape the responses of the entrepreneurially
oriented. The GEM model of the entrepreneur’s ecosystem is shown in
Figure 1.1. In the context of the model, Box 1 summarizes the core of
the GEM Adult Population Survey (APS)
Conceptual framework of the GEM Adult Population Survey.
	

The three components of the GEM Conceptual Framework and the assumed

	

relationships among them are at the heart of the GEM contribution to a better

	

understanding of entrepreneurial energy in any economy. The analysis is

	

based on the following data:

	

	

10

•	 Individual attributes – which reflect perceptions about opportunities,

			 capabilities to act entrepreneurially, entrepreneurial intentions and
			 fear of failure;
	

	

•	 Social values – which reflect how the society values entrepreneurial

			 behavior, and
	

	

•	 Entrepreneurial indicators – different forms of entrepreneurial activity

			 along the life cycle of a venture

GEM classifies economies that participate in the study as factor driven,

11

efficiency driven, and innovation driven. The categories are derived
from the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness
Index which categorizes three phases of economic development based
on GDP per capita, and the export share represented by primary
goods. Canada is in the innovative economy classification, exhibiting
sufficient reliance on business sophistication and innovation despite
its engagement with basic resources. Businesses in an innovation
driven economy are more knowledge intensive and the service sector
figures more prominently in the economy. Entrepreneurship and
innovation factors play a more dominant role in the development of
these economies, but they still rely on a healthy profile of the basic
requirements and efficiency enhancing factors.

<-----Page 16----->Table 1.1 Social, Cultural, Political, and
Economic Context of Entrepreneurship.

(Source: GEM Global Report, 2014)

Beyond the structural aspects, The GEM model also views
entrepreneurship as a process occurring over different phases from
intention to start, to just starting, to running new or established
enterprises, and even to exit and discontinuance (not the same
parameter as business failure). Given variable contexts and conditions,
it is not inevitable that any one phase leads linearly to the next. Figure
1.2 shows the phases of entrepreneurship. In exploring the early
phases, the GEM project assembles data not available from business
statistics.

1.4.	 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE
The GEM project begins by grouping participating countries into three
categories identified by the World Economic Forum (WEF). These are

13

factor driven economies, efficiency driven economies and innovation
driven economies. The least developed, factor driven, economies
deliver the highest rates of entrepreneurship with the largest fraction
associated with necessity driven activity, alternatives for earning a
living being scarce. The efficiency based economies are intermediate
and the innovation based (knowledge) economies exhibit the overall
lowest entrepreneurship rates, but with the values dominated by
opportunity driven entrepreneurship, where attractive novel economic
niches are recognized.
ADULT POPULATION SURVEY (APS)
Using a telephone survey, an independent polling firm randomly
selected adults between the ages of 18 and 99. Their responses to a
series of detailed questions, phrased in everyday language, that are
used throughout the GEM international entrepreneurship project, were
solicited from interviewees. These are used to assess entrepreneurial
attitudes, activities, and aspirations of the national population.
They provide a profile of a representative cross section of the adult
populations, balanced for age and gender distribution. For analysis,

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 18----->the sample is weighted for age and gender to standard Canadian
demographic data. Where the sample size in a province was smaller

1. Introduction

than required for the standard set for statistical significance, provincial
samples were augmented in the participating provinces.
NATIONAL EXPERT SURVEY
National Expert survey (NES) themes are specified by GEM: finance,
policy, government programs, education and training, technology
transfer, support infrastructure, and wider society/culture fields. The
questionnaire presented a series of statements reflecting the GEM
perspective on conditions supporting entrepreneurship. The experts
are asked to estimate the degree to which each is true for Canada. The
final section solicits open ended responses, which are coded to nine
categories. The questions cover the nine major framework areas:
	 •	 Financing, governmental policies,
	 •	 Governmental programs,
	 •	 Education and training,
	 •	 Research and development transfer,

14

	 •	 Commercial infrastructure,
	 •	 Internal market openness,
	 •	 Physical infrastructure and
	 •	 Cultural and social norms.
STANDARD SOCIOECONOMIC DATA
Basic data were obtained from Statistics Canada and OECD
publications. Several other international and national agencies also
sponsored studies of relevance. These studies are cited in the report
where information is drawn from them.

The key indicators from the GEM survey probe:
	 •	 Entrepreneurial Attitudes

(How strong is the common perception in the general population

		

of a culture of entrepreneurship?)

	 •	 Entrepreneurial Activity

	 •	 Entrepreneurial Aspiration

by all entrepreneurs, both
the crucial productive
entrepreneurs and those
other entrepreneurs who also

creation.

­		

(What do these entrepreneurs seek to achieve?)

The primary indicators for these categories paint a portrait that is
unique to the GEM methodology of the individual entrepreneur acting
in the community.

2.1.	ATTITUDES
ATTITUDES INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
For any policy designed to support highly productive entrepreneurship,
impact is hard to measure. Yet it is clear that some of the most

15

important policy outcomes depend on attitudes and mind sets in the
general population10. A key policy goal for all jurisdictions is to foster
a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation through informing,
training, and educating. GEM provides a variety of perspectives
on the success of such policy through questions, both to the entire
adult population and specifically to the entrepreneurially oriented
themselves. This entrepreneurial culture shapes the challenges faced
by all entrepreneurs, both the crucial productive entrepreneurs and
those other entrepreneurs who also contribute to activity and job

<-----Page 20----->PERCEPTIONS OF OPPORTUNITY AND CAPACITY IN
THE GENERAL ADULT POPULATION
The strength of an entrepreneurial culture is reflected by how
optimistic the general population is about entrepreneurship. Four

2. The Practice of
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

questions appraise the perception of capacity for entrepreneurship.
(Abbreviations used in figures follow each question.)
	 Have you met an entrepreneur in the last two years? (know ent)
	 Do you think there is a good opportunity to start a business in the
	 next six months? (opp 6 mos)
	 Do you have the knowledge and skill to start a business? (know and
	skill)
	 Would fear of failure inhibit you from starting a business? (fear fail)
These data are complemented by responses that indicate how
entrepreneurs are regarded.
	 Is entrepreneurship a good career choice? (good career)
	 Are successful entrepreneurs highly regarded? (suc respected)
	 Does entrepreneurship receive good media coverage? (good media)

16

In Figure 2.1 the affirmative answers to these questions are reported
for the entire Canadian sample, age 18–99. In Figure 2.2 Canadian
public attitudes are compared with a reference group of comparable
countries.

total Canadian pop. age 18 -99.

The Canadian results can be put in international perspective if
attention is restricted to the 18 – 64 age groups used for other
countries. The reference group is from the G7 plus Norway (as resource
based), Australia, and Singapore (as a next high TEA jurisdiction).
Figure 2.2 shows the above variables compared in this group (sample
ages 18-64).
Figure 2.2 Attitudes among countries in a broad reference group.

17

Probably the first aspect to remark is the parallel between Australia
and Canada. This will recur below and make Canada – Australia
comparisons particularly interesting. Canada compares favourably
with the US with somewhat more perception of near term opportunity,
but exhibiting somewhat greater inhibition from fear of failure. The
perception of a high level of respect for successful entrepreneurs
is exhibited across the group. If Canada and the US (followed
closely by Australia) are quite confident on all of these measures,
Canadians are more optimistic about the short term environment and
Americans show more self-confidence. Overall, public perception of
entrepreneurship is high these countries.
Seniors’ attitudes. Internationally, seniors are excluded. In Canada,
seniors aged 65-99 were included (Fig. 2.1). The sample of seniors is
over four hundred. The attitudes of seniors toward entrepreneurship
were quite positive as shown in Table 2.1.

Although seniors know fewer entrepreneurs, they see opportunity
similarly to their junior colleagues and have higher confidence in skills
and lower fear of failure. They also hold higher opinions of the career.

2.2.	ACTIVITY
The heart of the GEM survey - the indicators that provide key
perspectives on the culture and circumstances of entrepreneurship are those where action, with its risks, is reported. These identify the
ongoing level of early stage start-up activity. Comparisons among
countries and trends over time in conjunction with the reports of the
expert survey on framework conditions provide the basic information
for judging outcomes of policy.
The analysis centres on two measures that are combined to head the

18

tabulations below.
	 1)	The nascent entrepreneurship rate, (the percentage of the
		

18 -99 age population for Canada (or the 18-64 age population in

		

international comparisons) who are currently engaged in setting

		

up a business that has not paid salary, wages or other payments to

		

owners for more than three months.

	 2)	The new business ownership rate, percentage of the same pair of
		

age populations who are currently owner-managers of new

		

businesses that have paid wages, salaries or any other payments to

		

owners for more than three months but not more than 42 months.

	 3)	 These two are combined (counting each individual only once) to
		

yield an overall indicator, ‘TEA’, the total early stage activity, or

		

the entrepreneurship rate.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 23----->2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

Understanding of TEA is enriched by analysis of: (1) gender, and (2)
opportunity versus necessity as the driver of entrepreneurship. It is
also helpful to compare the early stage entrepreneurship rate to the
population segment that own or manage an established business
in operation for over 42 months. Given the random sample of the
population, these respondents will predominately be owners and/
or managers of small and medium businesses that represent the next
stage for the successful entrepreneurs.
Figure 2.3 shows the Canadian data for the 18–99 population age
group surveyed in the Canada survey. The TEA is composed of nascent
entrepreneurship (9.9%) and new businesses (4.8%) with no double
counting, expressed as a percent of the population. TEA14 represents
this year’s result and Estbus represents the respondents in the survey
who do own/manage businesses over 42 months old. Opportunity vs.
necessity records answer to the question of the primary motivation.
Was the activity stimulated by recognition of an opportunity or was it
from lack of an alternative?

(% of pop. - ages 18 – 99 ) with breakdown by gender and
opportunity vs necessity driven.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 24----->Globally, where does Canada’s TEA stand? The quick answer is
that Canada is now very much at the top among innovation driven
economies. The US has been a clear leader in recent years. With

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

Canada’s return to the GEM survey last year, we now find Australia
and Canada in a virtual tie as close second to the US. An overall
international perspective is shown in Figure 2.4 that shows TEA
values for other countries in the innovation driven economy group1.
In all international comparisons, the population considered covers the
18–64 age range surveyed in other countries. (We see that this rate is
higher at 13% than the rate when seniors are included (i.e. 11.4%). The
younger population is more active. (Details on age as a variable appear
below.)
Figure 2.4 TEA values for economies1 in the
‘innovation driven’ category (18 – 64).

20

Values of TEA do evolve over time. In part these will follow changes in
business climates but such a model would oversimplify. For countries
like Canada, levels of TEA have been rising in the last few years.
The trends from 2001 to 2014 are shown in Figure 2.5 for Canada in
comparison to the US, UK, and Australia. Of course, the interpolation
of Canada data over the 2006 to 2013 gap is the most simplistic model
– linear.

1	 A few cases of countries with an admixture of other characteristics are omitted.

Figure 2.5 Selected TEA trends from 2001 t0 2014 (18 – 64).

The US continues as a clear leader and we find Australia and Canada in
a virtual tie as close second to the US. A useful way of placing Canada
in an international context is to place it in the context of the G7 leading

21

economies. In addition to the G7, Canada has a ‘near twin’ (as will be
seen in several parameters below) in Australia. In addition, Singapore
is an interesting high TEA economy presenting some contrasts. (Other
resource based economies such as Norway do not reveal many parallels
to Canada.) Elaborated activity data for this reference set of countries
are summarized in Figure 2. 6.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 26----->Figure 2.6 TEA Values for reference economies and Canada (18 – 64)

22

The present Canadian TEA rate of 13.0% of the 18-64 population
represents an increase of just less than one percent from the rate of
12.2% in the 2013 survey. The US experienced a similar increase. The

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

fairly stable 2013 to 2014 results compare to the 8% found in the last
full pre-2013 Canada report from 2003. A key observation in 2003 was
that the women’s entrepreneurship rate was only half that of men it
is now nearly 2/3 (as it was in 2013). The women’s share is similar in
Australia but slightly higher in the US. TEA is reported to be motivated
by opportunity more than necessity by a factor of about five, as it is in
Australia. The US ratio is larger, where it was smaller last year. (The
errors in small necessity rates render the ratios uncertain.)
The TEA from the US, Canada, Australia and the UK invite comparison
to the Continental economies, Germany (DE), France (FR) and Italy
(IT). Some European commentators have suggested a divide between
the more neo-liberal economic policies of the US, Canada, Australia

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 27----->2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

and the UK compared to those of the continental countries. If this is
valid, the data suggest a more neo-liberal economic culture is more
favourable to the individual entrepreneur, but clear evidence is lacking
to show this links to better overall economic performance2.
Further important parameters of the analysis of overall activity include
data about established businesses (those in business more than 42
months), about how TEA breaks down into its two components of
nascent activity (start-up in the past year) and new business (those
in operation but under 42 months old – ‘Babybus’), and about the
extent of informal investment in new businesses (here called angel
investment) , a crucial ingredient for start-up – this rate is dominated
by the key family and friends investors. Data for Canada and the
reference group are shown in Figure 2.7.
Figure 2.7 TEA components, nascent venture, and ‘baby business’; with
established businesses and informal investment rates.

23

We see that among the two TEA components: start-ups (nascent) of the
current year outnumber the young firms (babybus) that have operated
for less than 3.5 yrs. The data for established businesses (Estbus) are
seen to be systematically below the sum (TEA) of early stage values
recorded above in Figure 2.7.
Informal investors (Angels) are those who have made a personal
investment in the last two years. It is significantly less than TEA rates.

2	 A possible alternative explanatory factor was noted in 2013. It was the women’s
	 entrepreneurship rate, but 2014 data do not support this

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 28----->These are predominately the small investors belonging to the critical
friends and family supporters of start-up.
It is interesting that the established business rates in Canada and

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

Australia are larger than the US rate. As well, the ratio of nascent
activity to young firms is smaller for Australia and Canada than the US.
All this may suggest more efficient survival across the first transitions.   
The lower values for established businesses (representative of
outcomes of past entrepreneurship) reminds us of the precarious
character of entrepreneurial activity. Of course the established
businesses reported here reflect start-up over a number of years. A
2014 OECD policy paper on start-up firm dynamics12 provides data
on the fate of start-up firms after three years. Canadian data for end
years 2004, 2007, and 2010 indicate 22 – 24% not reported (inactive),
62 – 65% in the same size category (e.g. 0 – 9 employees) and 4 or 5%
growing out of their initial size category in those first three years. .
Tracking the relation between start-up phases and established business
has some bearing on churn in firm dynamics. For example, the high

24

established business rate in the context of low TEA in Japan suggests
a stable environment. If this is correct, it suggests a higher churn
rate in the US compared to Canada and Australia. The important
informal investor rate is higher in the US than in Canada or Australia.
The numbers involved are small and these differences may not be
significant, but it is clear that these rates are higher than those for
Europe or Japan.
A final issue informing the drivers of activity concerns motives for
entrepreneurial activity. This is complex. Much entrepreneurship
relates directly to the relation of the entrepreneur to the specific
attractions of the new activity. The one area susceptible to questions
addressed to all entrepreneurs centres on the economic motives
and the question of independence. Figure 2.8 shows percentage of
entrepreneurs (TEA) who identify maintaining income (maintain),
have motives mixed between opportunity and necessity (mixed),
increasing income (income up), increased independence (independ)
and improvement in one of various dimensions (improve).

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 29----->Figure 2.8 Motives for entrepreneurial activity.

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

The generalized question around improvement drew agreement from
the highest percentage of entrepreneurs considered in these culturally
related comparators to Canada. The UK is lower than the other three.
Income increase is preferred over independence in all countries except
the UK. Canada also appears stronger on independence. Mixed motives
were not an important response except in the UK. These motive data

25

provide little insight as to which entrepreneurs are looking toward
innovation or job growth, the scalable productive entrepreneurship
most highly prized.
Intrapreneurship – entrepreneurial employees
GEM has also recently introduced measurement of the parallel
to entrepreneurship that occurs within existing organizations,
new ventures created by employees for their principal employer
– ‘intrapreneurship’. Parallel to TEA the index is entrepreneurial
employee activity, EEA.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 30----->Figures 2.9 Intrapreneurship, EEA, percentages of the
total survey population and of those employed.

The survey items are based around questions that ask about
development of new activities for your main employer over the last
three years. Figure 2.9 shows data for percentage of respondents who:

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

(1) report taking a leading role in such development over the three year
period (All), (2) limiting the population to those who are now employed
(Emp) – not self-employed or unemployed, and (3) those who report
this leading role going on currently (Now), and (4) those employed
and active now (Emp. now) Leading countries are the UK, the US and
Australia in the same reference group as used for TEA comparisons.
Canada’s rates are near half of its TEA rates and similar to France,
Germany and Singapore rather than the leaders. If the activity data
suggest no lack of an entrepreneurship culture in Canada, the EEA
data suggest intrapreneurship as the problem area.
Leadership (the individual entrepreneurial act) is not the only role in
firm innovation. In larger companies projects commonly involve teams.
As well, the transition from nascent to young firms has an analogy in
bringing a new idea for an activity in a larger firm to implementation.
Some more detailed data on intrapreneurship are shown in Table 2.2.
The table first shows what percent of respondents report participation
in developing a new activity within the last three years. (A caution, the
respondent sample is only about 70% of the sample population for the

GEM Canada Report 2014

26

<-----Page 31----->2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

TEA rate and even smaller numbers answered sub-questions.). Next
the percentage reporting that the activity is proceeding now is listed.
The fraction generating the idea (‘intrapreneurs’) is noted. The ratio of
leadership roles to support roles is reported next and finally the extent
of participation in carrying the new activity forward to implementation
(the parallel to ‘baby business’ status) is recorded. Each of these is
presented in the context of the relevant number of responses. Note
that the base level of involvement in, 19.5% of 1453, or 283 innovation
participants in all roles, does compare favourably with the respondents
classified as TEA contributors.

The problem of innovation in Canadian firms
27

The results for the EEA rate confirm once more a widely remarked
concern in Canada – a failure of innovation and its relation to lagging
productivity. Both innovative activity and the adoption of ‘embedded
innovation’ in the form of the adoption of the latest technology are
weak. A detailed analysis of the problem appeared in 2009 from an
Expert Panel of the Council of Canadian Academies13: Innovation
and Business Strategy: Why Canada Falls Short. Interestingly, the
panel identifies business strategy as a major source of weakness. It
is clear that innovation in Canada needs stimulation. A direction is
suggested by the influential work of Mazzucato14 who has shown the
importance of government initiative, and acceptance of the major
risks, in transformative innovation. For example she identifies major
government programs critically contributing at several stages to the
eleven transformative technologies that, exploited together, achieved
the smart phone. In Canada an example of this approach was seen
in the government programs that supported the development of the
technology leading to exploitation of the oil sands. At present Canada
has an emerging healthy green technology sector. Active government
stimulus is a promising approach to inducing more innovation oriented
industry strategies.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 32----->Stages of Entrepreneurship.
The GEM model sees the life cycle of entrepreneurship as comprising
four stages: intention, early stage and new firm, established

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

business and discontinuance (see introduction.) A ‘snapshot’ of the
relationships among the phases emerges from looking at the activity
in the successive phases that were identified in the current year
surveys. Five survey variables from the four stages are instructive.
Three of these are new here to this report: Intent (a rather nebulous
stage), and two variables for discontinuance - a positive outcome, exit,
when the owner sells or transfers to a new owner and a negative one,
discontinuance, where the business closes.
	 •	 The intention variable asks for intentions to start a business in
		 the next three years (intent).
	 •	 The early stage can be represented by the TEA variable (TEA).
	 •	 Established business is measured as those reporting
		 ownership of a business that has been in operation for more than
		 42 months with income (EB).
	 •	 Discontinuance is measured in two variables: (i) owner exit
		 with business closure (Disc) and (ii) owner exit with continuance
		 of the business by others (Exit).

in the reference countries.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 33----->2. The Practice OF

Each of these variables is calculated on the basis of the % of the 18-64
population in 2014 that is active in that stage. Figure 2.10 presents
the successive phases from intention to either closing or transfer
to new owners. (Of course, these are different businesses at each
stage so no answer in the stages of a country column came from the
same interviewees.) The lesser variation from country to country of
the established business rate again underlines the volatility of early
entrepreneurship.

The five year survival rate for small firms has been reported by
Statistics Canada at approximately 50% over several years of data. A
recent OECD study of firm dynamics12. reports that Canadian ‘micro’
firms three years after formation (start-dates 2001, 2004, 2007). A
rough similarity between the ratios of established businesses surveyed
to start-ups of this year seems to be reasonably consistent with the
survival and growth rates data. (The OECD data is based on firm
registries and supporting statistical agency data, in contrast to the
GEM individual interview data.)

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 34----->2.3 ASPIRATIONS
A final key aspect of early stage entrepreneurship is the entrepreneur’s
aspirations. This has a great deal to do with the potential for impact

2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

on innovation and employment, i.e. on the question of productive
entrepreneurship. Three areas explore the ambitious intentions for the
new businesses intending growth: what fraction expects substantial job
growth, what fraction will produce new products and expand markets,
and what fraction will export.
Jobs. Is the new business creating jobs now, or expected to create
jobs in its first five years? Questions probed include the number of
jobs created and the overall expectation for the next five years, Basic
Canadian data appear in Table 2.3. Two further questions are used for
some comparisons of Canadian performance: the number expecting
more than 10 jobs and 50% growth in the first five years, and the
number expecting job growth greater than 19 jobs within the five years.

The data clearly reflect some growth aspirations among a majority of
the new firms. Of course, spectacular entrepreneurial successes are a
small fraction of total entrepreneurship. It may be interesting to note
that 5 among 258 respondents even aspire (realistically or not) to job
growth to one thousand or more employees (<2% of the responding
entrepreneur population). High job growth issues will be further
discussed in the next Chapter.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 35----->2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship

International comparison of Canadian performance in Figure 2.11
compare Canada to the US and Australia on two high aspiration
metrics. The first, blue, identifies firms expecting to grow to 20 or more
employees in five years. The second, red, identifies those that expect
to reach at least 10 employees accompanied by 50% or more business
growth.
Figure 2.11 Comparison of total high 5 year job growth aspirations.

The US entrepreneurs show greater job growth aspirations than
the Canadian or Australian (perhaps a consequence of the larger
31

economy). The numbers of new firms expecting to grow to 20 or more
jobs is small in all three cases and comparisons are uncertain, but the
incidence of expectation of exceeding ten employees accompanying
50% growth is clearly greater in the US. If we relate the job results
to the total respondent population (age 18 -64), the entrepreneurs
aspiring to creation of any jobs are 10.1% of the population in Canada,
11.5% in the US and 9.6% in Australia.
New markets and new products. New products and new markets
are two among Schumpeter’s (1911 - engl. transl. 1934)16 five types of
innovation identified in his classic work founding innovation theory.  
Innovations are often characterized as new to: the world, a country,
a firm, or a market. The GEM survey considers novelty in the market
most directly and combines this with interest in market expansion.
Questions in the survey addressed to entrepreneurs ask:
	 1	 Is the product offered by few or no other firms?
	 2	 Is the product new to all or some customers?
	 3	 More precisely, is the product new to all, some, or no customers.

Over half of the entrepreneurs have aspirations to expand markets or
offer products new to their customers (i.e. market).
A small number of EEA (entrepreneurial employees) also answered
questions about new products and market expansion. No significant
difference from the TEA population was detectable.
Again a useful international bench mark is to compare key variables
to results for the US and Australia. Reading from bottom to top are
percentages of entrepreneurs reporting a new product/new market
combination, ones reporting few businesses offering the same product
and no businesses offering the same product (i.e. a fully novel product).
The case of many businesses offering the same product is not reported.
32

Figure 2.12 Comparison of Canada to the US and Australia with
respect to uniqueness (no or few competitors) of products and whether
there is a novel product/market combination.

It is consistent with the observation that opportunity is much the more
common motivation for entrepreneurship than necessity in these
countries that a great many of the ventures have found specific niches
of their own in markets. They are innovating in varying degrees. The
US appears to lead with Canada close and Australia somewhat behind.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 37----->2. The Practice OF
Entrepreneurship
in Canada in 2014

Export. Export activity is a desirable contribution to the export
oriented Canadian economy. Market scale and geography are
important variables influencing export orientation. Canada’s position
as a resource strong US neighbour is distinct from all other countries
in the reference group. Nevertheless continuing the comparison with
the US and Australia may offer some insights. In Canada, 16.5% of
reporting entrepreneurs expect no customers outside Canada. Of the
remaining eighty-three percent 63.7% estimate export customers
between 1% and 25%. A final twenty-seven percent are export oriented
with 19.8% reporting export accounting for between 25% and 75% of
customers, and 7.4% export intensive firms reporting outside Canada
customers as between 75% and 100% of total customers (Figure 2.13).
A small number of EEA (entrepreneurial employee) respondents
responded to export questions. No significant differences from the TEA
population could be detected.
Figure 2.13 Percentage share of customers outside the country.

33

Failure to export at all (no foreign customers) seems evenly distributed
over the three countries and modest levels of export orientation
dominate in all. Canada, however, seems to lead in export oriented
ventures, quite possibly as a consequence of its unique geopolitical
positon. In studies of Canadian clusters in high technology, it is
common to find even small firms have few local customers17,18, in large
measure because the knowledge base is global. It is interesting to note
a significant correlation between start-ups looking to export and new
technology and a suggestive quite weak correlation between start-up
export orientation and job expectations.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 38----->This chapter expands on issues that emerged in discussion
of aspirations. The key policy concern is the extent to which

3. Entrepreneurs in
the Economy

entrepreneurship modifies the economic climate: jobs, innovation,
growth and sustainability.
How can economic impact be predicted? Baumol’s categories
distinguish productive from non-productive initiatives where the first
are seen as economically creative and the second simply re-arranging
the distribution of economic benefits. Clearly, the productive category
is closely tied to innovation. The total entrepreneurship measures do
not give indications of the degree to which a given effort has productive
content. (It was noted above that the less ‘productive’ may still have
positive aspects, as for example, in job creation, and, in any case, trying
something new is the first step in innovation.) However, Shane19, in an
award winning paper, shows that ‘non-productive’ entrepreneurship
may even be negative, e.g. for growth when too much local competition
is generated. He recommends that policy instruments be carefully
designed to focus start-up support on those new businesses that have
clear growth plans.

34

“Policy makers should stop subsidizing the formation of the
typical start-up and focus on the subset of businesses with growth
potential”19.
Alexander20 introduced a second distinction: “A portion of the
economic effort in a city is supported by non-local demands. But these
city people in turn have need for local services, thus a second urban
function is … that which caters to the [local] needs.” The first category
is a key driver of regional growth and is associated much more strongly
with sectors other than consumer services. It is commonly assumed
that the transformative sector (manufacturing, etc.) offers greater
opportunity to ‘productive’ entrepreneurs. The innovation literature
has recently emphasized the role of knowledge intensive business
services, KIBS21, which suggests business services may be an important
sector for innovative opportunities.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 39----->3. Entrepreneurs in

Job creation and export propensity are central parts of analysis of
economic impact, for which some main point were treated in the
aspirations discussion that recorded entrepreneurs predictions.
This chapter begins with the analysis of the sector distribution of
entrepreneurial effort.

3.1 SECTORS
GEM data offer indicators through cataloguing the limited number of
initiatives into four sectors:
	 •	 Extractive (e.g. mining, agriculture),
	 •	 Transformative (e.g. manufacturing),
	 •	 Business oriented services,
	 •	 Consumer oriented services.
The distribution among these sectors (Figure 3.1) offers insight into
the sort of economic development that can result from entrepreneurial
activity.
Figure 3.1 2014 Distribution (as % of TEA) of initiatives over four sectors.

35

The 2014 distribution over sectors for the reference group of
countries is shown in Figure 3.1. This group underlines the leading
role of consumer services in entrepreneurial activity. The ‘nonlocal’ (Alexander20) market sectors most likely to generate highly
productive innovations do not lead. The notable cases with a lower
share of consumer orientation are Canada and Australia (with France).

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 40----->Germany (DE) and the US (known for manufacturing) are high in
business oriented services but not transformative sectors. Canada and

3. Entrepreneurs in
the Economy

Australia are also strong in business oriented services.
In 2013 the business oriented services sector in Canada commanded
42.6% of TEA initiatives. The large drop to <35 may reflect the small
number of response that comprise sub-categories of TEA. The TEA
number is 273 for 2014. Since there in not expected to be such large
changes in entrepreneurial behavior over one year, and there is
essentially no chance of significant overlap of respondents from 2013
to 2014. It may be useful to pool the TEA respondents of the two years
to produce a sample of nearly 600 entrepreneurs. Figure 3.2 shows
the sector distribution for the pooled 2014 and 2013 TEA populations.
These are compared to the established business (EB) respondents.
(Cursory examination of the data on distribution of employee numbers
indicates the expected dominance of both TEA and EB by small
enterprises.)
Figure 3.2 Distribution over sectors by percent of
TEA or EB respondents.
(2013 and 2014 pooled responses)

36

A relevant reference point for interpretation of the TEA data is the
sectorial distribution of established businesses identified by owner/
managers who were encountered in the surveys. The EB data offer
some insight into prospects for the new initiatives (although EBs may
represent a range of ages and economic circumstances at founding).

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 41----->3. Entrepreneurs in
the Economy

The pooled data suggest that business oriented services are the leading
sector for both new initiatives and established small businesses
responding in this random sample of the adult population. The
increase in business services share and decrease in consumer oriented
services share in the EB population compared to the TEA population
suggests higher survival rates in business services.
The low level of extractive sector entrepreneurial activity is surprising.
The expected importance of extractive industries in Canada is better
exhibited by the established businesses. It is probable that the high
fraction of business oriented services includes new small businesses
serving extractive industries. This is evident in an “oil and gas” centre
such as Calgary where a large fraction of business services serve the
core cluster, especially in knowledge oriented services.
A subset of respondents in the EEA (entrepreneurial employee)
population answered the sector question. The distribution is not
significantly different from the TEA population except for a small,
possibly significant, increase in the share of business services.

37

3.2 TECHNOLOGY
The share of TEA active in high or medium technology sectors is also
often assumed to be an indicator linked to innovation and growth
ambitions. The percentage of TEA reporting such high or medium
technology (OECD definitions) is:
Table 3.1 High or medium technology sector (OECD def.)
	

CA	US	AU	UK	FR	DE	IT	 JP	SG

	5.7	 9.4	 11.1	8.9	 11.3	6.8	 5.9	 7	 5.6

As with business services, Canada’s reported participation is lower
than in 2013. The pattern here does not have obvious interpretations
and reflects small numbers of entrepreneurial initiatives and high
uncertainty in all cases. Probably a better indicator for innovation
related to technology is the question of the novelty of the technology
used in the new initiatives. Here three categories are probed. Does

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 42----->technology used include technology novel in the last year (latest yr.),
introduced in the last 1-5 years (last 1-5 yr.) or older than 5 years (old

3. Entrepreneurs in
the Economy

tech).
Figure 3.3 Percent of entrepreneurs using recent vs older technology.

Clearly the majority of entrepreneurs do not report a critical
dependence on new technologies. The data suggest leadership from
Singapore, which has probably supported this with policy directions.

38

France reports a strikingly high level of use of the latest technology. Of
course, industrial structure is expected to influence this factor, but no
simple interpretation of the trends suggests itself. Notice the similarly
low levels in Canada and Australia.

3.3 HIGH LEVEL JOB CREATION
High levels of job creation have direct impact on the economy. Various
studies show firms have their greatest impact on employment in
phases of high growth. Data supports the contention that high growth
decreases in likelihood with the age of a firm22. Yet small firms, as
noted above12, make a major contribution to employment losses.
The basic data about high job growth were reported in the aspirations
section above. A closer reading of the Canadian data is given here. Note
that the number of Canadian respondents answering the questions
placing them in the category, TEA2014, was 273. The international
comparisons (Figure 2.8) are based on percentages of respondents
to each question. The raw Canadian data, which can be accessed for

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 43----->3. Entrepreneurs in
the Economy

this report, reveal that there is a significant variation in response
rates for the job questions. It is instructive to consider the actual
numbers of positive respondents to each question. Only 6 of the
TEA2014 entrepreneurs reported current employment above 20, but
the overall response rate to this question was low. There were good
overall response rates to the same questions posed to established
business owner/managers and 23 reported employment above 20.
There was also a good response rate to the question asking for expected
employment levels in five years. Forty one TEA2014 entrepreneurs
anticipated job levels above 20 within five years. As might be expected,
the firms enjoying still higher growth in their early years is a small
specialized fraction. Case study approaches have been used to analyze
the characteristics of selected examples of successful growth. In
contrast, the comprehensive population coverage of the GEM Adult
Population Survey provides perspectives on the overall frequency and
aspirations for impact of this category of entrepreneurship.
As a small ‘case study’ from these interviews, Table 3.2 collects the five
highest current job numbers reported and job numbers anticipated

39

within five years by entrepreneurs in either start-up phase or owners/
managers of young businesses (TEA). Firms represented by numbers
in two adjacent columns may be different ones. In the anticipation for
five years, two entrepreneurs projected 1000 employees. What these
cases illustrate is that the population includes a small but significant
percentage, hard to identify in a broad survey, that have aspirations
to create high impact on employment. They are found among a more
easily characterized population of entrepreneurs with modest job
growth ambitions. The numbers underline Shane’s19 recommendation
that public policy be carefully designed to selectively support initiatives
with clear growth aspirations rather that provide blanket support for
entrepreneurship. High growth projections by established businesses
are shown. This shows that growth expectation is much higher for start
–ups.

A recent OECD study of firm dynamics12 reports that Canadian ‘micro’
firms three years after formation (start-dates 2001, 2004, 2007), if
inactive (about 30% of firms), contribute about  -35% to employment
(loss), but those stable in a size class (about 65% of firms) contribute
about +20% to employment (gain) and those growing into a larger
size class (about 5% of firms) contribute about +40% to employment
(gain). That is, the major contribution to employment comes from a
rather small set of firms. Further GEM data on this point appears in the

40

next section.)  The Canadian established business rate captures firms
started more than 3.5 years ago, but also over a number of years before.
Jeff Desjardins has coined the term ‘Narwhals’23 for Canadian startups founded since 1999 that have achieved a billion dollar valuation.
Four were identified. The disappointing feature is that the average
employment reported is less than 330. Apparently, market value alone
is not a comprehensive impact indicator.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 45----->4. Entrepreneurship
demographics

4.1. AGE
The GEM adult population survey addresses the working age
population from 18 to 64. In the international comparisons, seniors
are excluded. The population is segmented into five ranges: 1824, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64. Age distributions of TEA
‘entrepreneurship’ in selected countries are collected in Figure 4.1. All
show strong entrepreneurial engagement among the younger work
force, with participation showing a peak in the 25-34 age group. (It is
interesting that this is the peak age group reported for MIT graduate
entrepreneurs in a 2009 study24.) Canada has a peak of activity in the
45-54 age group (which was not observed last year). The decline in rate
in the older 55-64 decade is common to all countries.
The Canadian data differ from 2013 data in rate changes of 2-3% of
entrepreneurs. The changes are an increase in activity in the 18-24 age
group and the 45-54 age group with a similar drop in the 25-34 age
group. The changes may reflect trends but with only one year of data it
is difficult to reject fluctuations as an explanation.

Seniors are not covered in international data, but the Canadian APS
included respondents to age 99. This provided a final sample of 453
seniors that yielded positive responses for a TEA of 4.3%, extending
the downward trend from the 55-64 group. This group divided ~3/2
male/female with most reporting opportunity rather than necessity.
Approximately 10% anticipate more than five employees and at least
50% growth in five years. Over one third of these entrepreneurs are
42

over 70. The TEA rate for seniors is significantly higher than that found
in 2013 with a similar gender distribution. The numbers for high job
growth are smaller, but this result is of doubtful statistical significance.
With changing conditions for seniors, it will be important to continue
to monitor this group and the sample size is already satisfactory.

4.2. EDUCATION
Educational attainment is a variable that is best benchmarked by
comparing similar systems since cultural factors play a large role. Data
are reported here for Canada, the US, Australia, and the UK in Figure
4.2. The data for Canada are compared to the educational attainments
of owner/managers of Canadian established businesses as a reference
point then international comparisons are given.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 47----->4. Entrepreneurship
demographics

Figure 4.2 TEA rate (% pop.) by educational attainment compared to
education reported by Canadian established business owners.

Patterns are similar among these countries. At the minimal education
level there is a significant rate of entrepreneurial activity. (It should be
noted the number of respondents at this educational level is small). In
43

contrast to 2013 rates, this first level outpaces entrepreneurship among
secondary graduates, but not holders of a post-secondary qualification.
Starting from holders of secondary diplomas, entrepreneurship is
uniformly more common as education level rises to a post-secondary
qualification, then to post graduate experience. This common pattern
indicates importance of knowledge and skills. Australia stands out in
TEA among those with post-graduate experience suggesting an edge
in areas where highly specialized skills and knowledge are important.
Once again Canada and Australia are generally similar.
An interesting point is that the educational pattern among owners of
established businesses parallels educational attainment patterns of the
new entrepreneurs.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 48----->4.3. GENDER
Confidence. Most of the general population attitudes towards

4. Entrepreneurship
demographics

entrepreneurship reported above show little variation between male
and female respondents. However, differences of significance do arise
with respect to the perception of having needed skills and knowledge
(Suskl), and the question of a barrier posed by fear of failure (Ffail).
Women express somewhat less confidence in skills and a somewhat
higher fear of failure. Comparisons among Canada, the US, Australia,
and the UK are shown in Figure 4.3. (In Fig 4.3, f and m designate
female and male. The sample covers the 18 -64 age range)
Figure 4.3 Confidence about starting a business by gender (% of pop.).

44

The male-female rates of early stage entrepreneurship were noted
above (and are repeated here in a larger context). In most countries
the TEA reported by males is higher than that reported by females,
although the ratios vary widely among developing countries. The
ratios vary less among culturally similar countries such that detailed
comparison is meaningful. The figure compares Canada to the US,
Australia and the UK. As well, it is quite interesting to compare the
gender ratios for early stage efforts to those found among the owners/
managers of established businesses (EB, business life >3.5 years) which
are presented next to Canadian TEA in the figure. The gender ratio is
approximately 3/2, a bit lower for the UK. This is little changed from
2013.

Gender and economic factors: business sector, job aspirations,
technology. Further exploration of gender roles raises questions of
economic sector participation, job growth aspirations and use of
technology. Table 4.2 shows percentage of entrepreneurs active in
each of the four sectors mentioned above, reports whether or not newer
technology is important and presents the percentage with high growth
45

and job expectations within five years.  (Abbreviations follow parallel
analyses in earlier sections.)

The distribution over business sectors of initiatives does show
significant gender differences. Female entrepreneurs are less well
represented in the transformative (e.g. Manufacturing) sector and
business services sector, while they are much more prominent in the
consumer services sector. Does this last difference relate to lower job
growth aspirations expressed by the female entrepreneurs?
It can be said that there is no more than a marginal difference in the
propensity to use contemporary technology.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 50----->Beyond the ‘for profit’ economy there is a great deal of
entrepreneurship in the formation of organizations and initiatives

Entrepreneurship

that are oriented toward social, environmental cultural or community
goals. The entrepreneurs who initiate or manage such activities make
a major contribution to quality of life1, and beyond this intrinsic merit,
play a significant role in the environment for productive economic
growth. For example there is substantial research supporting the
idea that quality of life and cultural richness, function as talent
attractors, and play an important role in the economic success of cities.
Social entrepreneurship is an important topic in its own right for
contributions to key goals of sustainability and quality of life but it also
contributes to framework conditions for commercial entrepreneurship.
Table 5.1 provides a first look at the prevalence and structure of social
entrepreneurship activity.

The table shows that 8.6 percent of respondents are currently engaged
in start-up or management (or ownership) of a social activity. Seventyone percent of those active indicate start-up efforts occurred in the
last year, in some cases for a second activity. Management roles
vary as seen in the next three columns and the majority do not have
this activity as a part of their ‘daily job’. Fully a quarter work in the
activity part time and only a minority report it as their daily job. Of the
respondents, 28% reported that the activity, organization or initiative
had provided service or received external funding for more than 3
months compared to 61% answering ‘no’.
The majority of specific services identified were focused in a specific
community and some were for profit businesses with a ‘social’ goal.  
Most of the activities were small, but had growth aspirations.

Table 5.2 shows data on the small current numbers of ‘workers’ (Work
now), not necessarily employees and the distribution of this work to
volunteers and part time workers. (An individual worker may fit in
more than one category.) The last column shows anticipated numbers
of workers in five years. The mode (most commonly reported number
of workers) and maximum (Max case – There is only a single example
of this number in each column) are shown. Unfortunately, not all
social entrepreneurs responded to these questions about workers. The
maximum number of responses was only 43.

Fifty three percent report that income to support these activities will
come, at least in part from sale of goods or charges for services. Forty

47

four percent of respondents report 100% of activity income from these
sales/charges. Only 14% report 20% or less of total income from such
business activity. Respondents were asked to assign points to impact
in the areas of the economic, social or environmental value of the
activities. The median for economic value was 44 points, social value
35 points and environmental value 15 points. An economic focus
is clearly present among the activities encountered. There is some
concern that the economic focus of the majority of questions in the
GEM survey may have influenced the interpretation of the concept of
social entrepreneurship.
Measuring impacts of social initiatives is important in the
multidimensional domain of social entrepreneurship. Impact of the
activities was being measured in 13% of the reported cases, plans to
measure existed in 34% of cases and 43% had no plans to measure
impact.

<-----Page 52----->An important characteristic of Canada is that it is a nation of regions.
Economic structure, culture and geography vary widely. Consequently,

an analysis of Canada cannot be complete without some comparative
data for provinces. Figure 7.1 shows the early stage entrepreneurship
rates (TEA) for the five provinces where the number of entrepreneurs
identified in the survey was sufficient. The number of significant figures
is adjusted for error estimates. This sample includes one from Atlantic
Canada, two large central Canadian provinces (one French speaking
and one English speaking) and two large Western provinces (one an
interior resource economy and one a coastal resource economy.)

The

figure shows overall TEA values and the rates of male and female
entrepreneurship. The percentage of established businesses (> 3.5
yr. old) is given as a reference point. Alberta, with its oil/gas as lead
industry, has the highest rates followed by BC with the remarkable
characteristic of effective gender parity. (There was a small imbalance,
male > female, in the 2013 data.) The manufacturing centre, Ontario, is
at the national average. Quebec, also a manufacturing centre, and Nova
Scotia, a maritime province, are somewhat below that average.

Figure 6.1 Early stage entrepreneurship (TEA %) by province.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 53----->6. Entrepreneurship
by Province

Turning attention to entrepreneurial employees (EEA) – the
intrapreneurs – a different picture emerges. The survey items are based
around questions that ask about development of new activities for your
main employer over the last three years. Figure 6.2 shows data for
percentage of respondents who: (1) report taking a leading role in such
development over a three year period (pop), (2) limiting the population
to those who are presently employed (emp) – not self-employed or
unemployed, and (3) those who report this leading role going on now
(now), and (4) those now employed and active now (emp. now). The
two rates (%) based on the currently employed population are probably
the most revealing. Here the industrial base economies show greater
relative strength with Quebec a leader. Quebec is known for some
technologically advanced sectors, e.g. aerospace. Alberta, with its rapid
recent economic growth, is still high, while Ontario and Nova Scotia
report competitive rates. As with TEA, the largest province, Ontario, is
at the national average. The national Canadian data complete the figure
for comparison.

<-----Page 54----->The Canadian framework conditions that create the environment for
entrepreneurship are probed by the National Experts Survey (NES).
Forty-two experts from nine professional perspectives responded
to a series of statements used in the global NES study. These

7. Framework
for the Canadian
entrepreneurship
environment: NES

statements express GEM formulations of circumstances favourable to
entrepreneurship. The experts identify how favourable conditions in
Canada are by rating the statements on a five point scale:
	 1.	 ‘completely false’,
	 2.	 ’partially false’,
	 3.	 ‘neither true nor false’,
	 4.	 ‘partially true’,
	 5.	 ‘completely true’.
These are coded on the 1-5 scale. Discussion here will focus on the
means that assume a quasi-continuous underlying variable. Mean
scores above 3 indicate some agreement with the statements. An
alternative view is given by the modes that identify the evaluation of
the statement given by the largest number of experts, a convergent

50

group within the panel. The survey has been carefully validated for
quantitative significance and international comparability. Finally,
the experts provided open ended comments that were coded into
categories.

7.1 FINANCE
Availability of finance is, of course, critical. The population survey
has provided one possibly positive sign, the relatively high incidence
of informal investing. However this needs to be put in the context of
the combination of equity, debt, and government subsidy IPOs and
venture capital. Questions to experts asked whether each of these was
sufficient to Canadian needs. The score of 3 represents neither true nor
false where 1 represents completely false and 5 completely true. The
mean gives insight on balance of opinion and the mode emphasizes
where a major group is converging. Finance question scores are
summarized in Figure 7.1.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 55----->Figure 7.1 Sufficiency of Financial Sources.

7. Framework

entrepreneurship
environment: NES

In comparison to last year, expert opinion is more positive. Means
are near neutral to slightly positive. Only in the case of Debt and IPO
funding did the largest number of experts make 2 the mode. There is
some doubt as to whether IPO funding is important to first stage new
firms. The conclusions here should probably be interpreted with an eye
to analysis in the EY G20 Entrepreneurship Barometer26 which finds
Canada among the most favourable countries for finance, with the cost

51

of starting a business dropping by a factor of two in recent years.
Data from the population survey (APS) includes evidence about
‘business angels’ who have contributed in the last three years to a
venture not their own and not via share or mutual fund purchase. The
participation rate in Canada was 5.5% which compares to 6.1% in the
US and 5.1% in Australia (within standard error of each other). The UK
rate was 2.1 %. These contributions would lie in the private category.
Eighty-six such angels were found in the Canada survey. The median
investment was $15,000 and ten of the 85 invested between $25,000
and $1 million. About 40% had family connections to the entrepreneur
(‘friends and family money’). This picture of angel investing seems
consistent with the expert appraisal of the status of private investment.

7.2 GOVERNMENT POLICY AND PROGRAMS
Government policies were probed on five aspects:
	 •	 that government policies (e.g. procurement) consistently favour
		 new firms,

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 56----->	 •	 that the support of new and growing firms is a national, federal
		 government, high priority,
	 •	that support  for new and growing firms are a high priority for
		 local government,
	 •	 that new firms can get required permits and licences in about a
		 week (timeliness),

7. Framework
for the Canadian
entrepreneurship
environment: NES

	 •	 that the amount of taxes is NOT a burden for new and growing
	 	 firms.
	 •	 Taxes and other regulations are applied in a predictable and
		 consistent fashion.
Means and modes on the 1-5 scale, 1- completely false, 5 - completely
true, are shown in Figure 7.2 along with data on government programs.
Scores generally lean to the negative side. Only consistency of
regulation receives a mean score tending toward ‘partially true’. For
priority given by local governments, in the Canadian context either

provincial and municipal or both, to new firms receives a mode of
4, ‘partially true’, despite a slightly negative mean, reflecting a split
opinion. The experts believe policies such as procurement do not

52

consistently favour new and growing firms. Issuing permits and
licenses is not seen as timely (in contrast to conclusions drawn in
EY26.). This connects to an ongoing government conversation in
Canada about reduction of ‘red tape’. Experts feel reduction should
continue. As to tax levels, the mean near neutral with a mode of 1
identifies a split of opinion. Nineteen respondents chose a degree of
‘false’ and fourteen chose a degree of ‘true’. The split did not depend on
province.
Government policies were probed for six characteristics:
	 •	 a wide range of services for new and growing firms can be
		 obtained through a single agency,
	 •	 science parks and incubators provide effective support,
	 •	 an adequate number of program for new and growing firms,
	 •	 people working in government agencies are competent and
	 	

effective in provision of support to new and growing firms,

	 •	 those needing government help for a new and growing business
	 	 can find what they need and,
	 •	 programs supporting new and growing firms are effective.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 57----->7. Framework
for the Canadian
entrepreneurship
environment: NES

Provision of effective support for science parks and incubators
is rated ‘partially true’ (4) by the largest number (with a mean of
3.7). Government workers (agents) are similarly judged (mode 4)
‘competent and effective in supporting new and growing firms’ (mean
only 3). The statement, ‘there are an adequate number of government
programs for new and growing firms drew a positive score last year,
but here falls to a neutral mean (3) and a negative mode (2). The
question of satisfying needs draws a low mean and a higher mode
indicating a significant split of opinions.
It is worth noting here that the recent Federal Budget offers new
support for small firms in the form of reducing tax rates over the
next few years from 11% to 9% . As well, expanded activity of the
Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) is foreseen. The BDC
plays an important role in helping Canadian small and medium-sized
enterprises grow and become more competitive, innovate, increase
their efficiency and explore new markets, at home and abroad.

characteristics that may require more early and continuing attention
than do the specific skills. The core characteristics may provide a good
base for development of entrepreneurial thinking.
At the post-secondary level a distinction is drawn between college

54

and university programs in general and business and management
education. In the broad domains the statement is that preparation is
adequate for starting up and growing new firms. The mean score has
risen from 2.4 last year to 3.0 and the most common scoring (mode)
is now 4, tending toward ‘partially true’. A similar statement directed
to business and management education receives a slightly better
mean score of 3.3 (mode = 4). Finally, the statement directed toward
professional, continuing and vocational education, draws a mean score
of 3.1. It is notable that, in contrast to last year, over 10% of responses
found this positive statement about post-secondary preparation
‘completely true’ (5).
The standards set by the phrasing of GEM propositions indicate
that low scores require increased focus on entrepreneurial thinking
and entrepreneurship in primary and secondary education, but the
experts appear to recognize the significant new initiatives arising in
post-secondary institutions.

Expert opinion is clear that improvements are necessary, but it
seems important to go beyond the coverage of the GEM propositions.
Policy for entrepreneurship education must be entrepreneurship
for innovation. Moreover it must recognize the importance of social
entrepreneurship, and ‘intrapreneurship’, entrepreneurial employees
within firms. (This last a weak point for Canada according to the
intrapreneurship(EEA) statistics reported above,)

7.4 R&D TRANSFER
R&D transfer policies were probed on five aspects with five assertions:
	 •	 New Science &Technology (S&T) and other knowledge are
	 	 efficiently transferred from universities and public research
	 	 centres to new and growing firms;
	 •	 Growing firms have just as much access to new research and
	 	 technology as large established firms;
	 •	 New and growing firms can afford latest technology;
	 •	 There are adequate government subsidies for new and growing
	 	 firms to acquire technology;
	 •	 The S&T base efficiently supports the creation of world-class new
		 technology based ventures in at least one area;

55

	 •	 There is good support available for engineers and scientists to
		 have their ideas commercialized.
The data in Figure 7.3 show significantly negative reactions with
respect to the first four of these propositions. Both public research
centres and larger firms are not judged efficient it at making new
research and technology available to small and growing firms, nor is
the government subsidizing access. These results are consistent with
the low level of use of the latest technology by entrepreneurs surveyed
(see Chap. 3). There is more optimism about Canada’s capacity to
support a world class technology firm and for Canadian scientists and
engineers to commercialize.

7.5 COMMERCIAL AND SERVICE
INFRASTRUCTURE, MARKET OPERATION

56

In the important area of services and infrastructure, five needs are
addressed:
	 •	 Subcontractors, suppliers, consultants 		

-	 There are enough,

	 	

-	 Small and growing firms can afford them,

	 	 -	 It is easy for small and growing firms to get these support
			services;
	 •	 It is easy for small and growing firms to get good professional legal
		 and accounting;
	 •	 It is easy for small and growing firms to get good banking.
Experts give positive responses to supply of subcontractors, etc., legal
and accounting, and banking services. There is less confidence about
ease of access to subcontractors, suppliers and consultants and their
affordability, results parallel to last years’. These probably reflect the
common lack of resources facing a start-up.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 61----->7. Framework
for the Canadian
entrepreneurship
environment: NES

Figure 7.4 Access to commercial services.

7.6 MARKET DYNAMICS
Market structures and market access are major framework factors

57

influencing new firms that include volatility, ease and cost of entry
to new markets, barriers from established firms, and the status of
anti-trust (competition) legislation. Dynamics are covered in terms of
market year to year change (volatility) for both consumer markets and
business to business – B2B - markets. Entry involves ease and cost of
entry to new markets. Barriers are those erected by established firms
and those prevented by anti-trust protection. The expert evaluations
are summarized in Figure 7.5. Markets are seen as moderately flexible
and open, with cost of entry and established firm resistance seen as
limiting. These reflect only small shifts from last year, with a slight
increase in ease of entry and a lower score for consumer volatility.
This is again an interesting disagreement with data from the EY G20
Entrepreneurship Barometer26.  that finds Canadian cost of entry low
and reports a recent sharp decline. Canadian anti-trust protection is
seen as marginally adequate.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 62----->Figure 7.5 Market dynamics for new and growing firms.

7. Framework
for the Canadian
entrepreneurship
environment: NES

7.7 PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Physical infrastructure for new and growing firms is appraised by the

58

experts’ views of five statements:
	 •	 Physical infrastructures provides good support;
	 •	 It is not too expensive to access good communication (phone,
		 internet, etc.);
	 •	 A new firm can get access to communication (iPhone, etc.) in
		 about a week;
	 •	 New and growing firms can afford basic utilities (gas, water,
		 electricity, etc.);
	 •	 New and growing firms can get good access to basic utilities.
Similarly to last year, this is the most favourably rated area. All of these
were found largely true in the Canadian environment with means of
4.2 except good access to utilities at 4.3 modes reached 5 for utility
affordability and access for new and growing firms. This is an area of
strength with evaluation higher than last year’s good rankings. But
the survey did not directly address whether it is easy to access leading
edge communication technology and that may lie behind some of the
reservations expressed.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 63----->7. Framework
for the Canadian
entrepreneurship
environment: NES

7.8 CULTURAL AND SOCIAL NORMS
The fundamentals of Canadian national culture are regarded as
reasonably favourable. Three statements command a reasonable degree
of assent:
	 •	 Canadian culture is highly supportive of individual success
		 achieved through personal effort;
	 •	 Canadian culture emphasizes self-sufficiency, autonomy and
		 personal initiative;
	 •	 Canadian culture encourages creativity and innovativeness.
For these, mean scores decline from 3.6 for the first to 3.3 then to
3.0 for the third. The mode is 4 (partially true) for the first two and 2
(partially false) for the third (creativity and innovativeness). The fourth
proposition is:
	 •	 Canadian culture encourages entrepreneurship and
		 entrepreneurial risk taking.
It receives a more positive score with a mean of 3.3 and mode at 4,
with a mode at 2, ‘partially true’. The final proposition in this group

59

proposes that:
	 •	 In Canadian culture, responsibility for managing his or her own
		 affairs lies with the individual (rather than the collective).
The mean is 3.3 and the mode is 4. A clear split of opinion leads to a
small margin for ‘partly true over ‘partly false’ with a few completely
true responses. This split probably reveals a well- known fault line in
Canadian politics.
The work-life relationship is a second dimension of the social
environment. Do social, political and cultural conditions in Canada
allow harmonization of personal and working life? Experts are divided
(mean 2.7). The idea that labour regulations support this is supported
(mean 3.0).
The related dimensions are whether entrepreneurs’ work and personal
life compares favourably to non-entrepreneurs. The expert diagnosis is
affirmative (means, 3.8 and 3.2).

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 64----->7.9 MEAN EXPERT OVERALL RATINGS OF THE
AREAS OF FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS
Beyond the expert appraisal of the detailed framework condition issues
the entrepreneurs face; it is useful to take an overview of the areas and

7. Framework

their relative ratings. GEM defines twelve groupings of framework
conditions (variables in the above sections) for establishing this profile.
The grouped variables are as follows:
	 •	 Financial
	 •	 Gov’t policies - concrete
	 •	 Gov’t policies – priority, bureaucracy
	 •	 Gov’t programs
	 •	 Education and training – primary, secondary
	 •	 Education and training – post-secondary, vocational
	 •	 R&D transfer
	 •	 Professional & commercial infrastructure
	 •	 Internal market dynamics – summary
	 •	 Internal market dynamics – barriers
	 •	 Physical infrastructure

60

	 •	 Cultural and social norms (for entrepreneurship)
The ordering of means for these grouped variables are shown in Figure
7.6. As was the case last year, the highest rated framework condition in
Canada is physical infrastructure for the young and growing firms. This
is followed by professional and commercial infrastructure, cultural
and social norms and post-secondary education for entrepreneurship,
and finance as the ones above the totally neutral score of 3.0. This
represents improvement of the ratings for both post-secondary
education and finance compared to opinion last year. As was the case
last year, both R&D transfer and Primary and secondary education for
entrepreneurship are ranked low.

7.10 OPEN-ENDED COMMENT:
CONSTRAINTS, FACILITATING FACTORS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS.
After completing the structured questions, NES expert respondents
were asked to provide open-ended comments identifying constraints
entrepreneurs face, facilitating factors supporting entrepreneurship,
and their own recommendations for modification of framework
conditions. A wide variety of ideas emerged. Their richness cannot
be represented here, but the responses were coded as fitting one of
fourteen topics and the areas of concern can be recognized in the
frequency of mention of each of these topics. In each case, experts
were asked to give three ideas in a priority order of first in importance
to third. A relatively small number of topics dominated these
responses.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 66----->In the case of constraints on entrepreneurs, five of the fourteen were
multiply represented. Figure 7.7 presents the number of incidences of
each of these. Despite relatively positive comments above about finance
available for entrepreneurs, twenty nine comments identified financial

constraints, more of these as the third priority of the expert. Much of
the government role was seen as constraining in twenty two responses,
evenly divided between policy and programs. Limits on education
and training drew nine comments at first and third priority. Finally
the cultural and social norms faced by entrepreneurs were as limiting
by fifteen, in contrast to the very positive climate reported in the APS
attitudes survey.
Figure 7.7 Framework conditions seen by experts as constraining.

environment: NES

Figure 7.8 presents the contrasting situation of framework conditions
that foster entrepreneurship in one way or another. Education and
training, R&D transfer, both government policies and programs, and
the cultural and social climate were seen as areas where conditions
could foster entrepreneurship. None of these were areas where the
present conditions were highly rated above. Finding good aspects
in the detailed open comments probably reflects the importance  
experts attach to the areas. The remaining three were capacity for
entrepreneurship, the economic climate (understandable in 2014), and
commercial and professional infrastructure (which was rated positively
above).
Figure 7.8 Framework conditions fostering entrepreneurship.

areas, all mentioned above in constraints and/or fostering factors. Not
surprisingly, recommendations directed to government, policy and
programs, led the list. The next area of emphasis was recommendations

related to education and training. Sixteen recommendations related
to finance were proposed and a few related to the cultural and social
norms, and to capacity for entrepreneurship completing the list of
prominent areas of recommendation. Data are shown in Figure 7.9.
Figure 7.9 Main areas of expert recommendations.

64

Finally, it may be worth noting that with thirty-six experts and fourteen
areas each expert had the opportunity (not always exercised) to touch
upon almost eight areas in responses to each of the three questions.
Overall, this supported the rich variety of comment.

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 69----->8. CONCLUSIONS AND
IMPLICATIONS

CULTURE
In common with reference countries, the APS data continue to
demonstrate wide public recognition of the opportunities for
entrepreneurship, and the capacity (in contrast to expert opinion)
to undertake ventures. Entrepreneurship is seen as a good career
choice and success delivers high social status. There is little reason
for policy to further encourage an overall culture of entrepreneurship.
Rather attention should be directed to high impact ,quality initiatives
encouraging productive entrepreneurship and innovation.
ACTIVITY
In common with the other leaders, the US and Australia, 2014 data
indicate a small, but possibly significant, increase in TEA. This overall
level is perhaps as high as is needed in a developed market economy.
However, the TEA includes a higher number of nascent entrepreneurs
than new businesses. The TEA is strongly reflecting the highest risk
most vulnerable phase.

65

FINANCE
Expert opinion suggests that the framework conditions surrounding
finance are somewhat improved. However, ratings are not high and
expert identify finance constraints in open ended comment.  Finance
remains an important area for policy development, especially in a fluid
era with the emergence of such phenomena as crowd financing through  
social media.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
Experts offer a variety of suggestions. Perhaps the most important
aspect for policy is assimilation of the consequences of the recent
research27 showing that governments play a crucial role in accepting the
early phase risks of transformative innovation. For example, programs
at all levels could promote the rapidly emerging green technology
industry in Canada as a transformative sector.

<-----Page 70----->EDUCATION

creativity oriented, but lacking in specific basic economic education
and introduction to entrepreneurship itself. Encouragement to
entrepreneurship education is a recognized need. An improving expert
appraisal at the post-secondary level may reflect a stirring across
Canada to improve university level entrepreneurship education.
However, it is important to realize the overall goals of public policy:
jobs, growth, sustainability and quality of life. Entrepreneurship
education must orient attitudes toward ‘productive entrepreneurship’
(Baumol) and innovation. As Shane19 has shown, the simple act of
entrepreneurship does not produce positive economic outcomes
in many cases. The weakness of employee entrepreneurship (EEA)
emphasizes the broad significance of entrepreneurial thinking.
Thus, the goal for education is fostering an entrepreneurial attitude

66

contexts and cultivating skills to develop them. At the post-secondary
level this recommends interdisciplinary initiatives.
INNOVATION
There is a measure of innovation in every entrepreneurial act, an
opportunity has been recognized. However, substantial innovation is
not commonly achieved by firms that remain small. A key indicator
is growth aspiration.  It emerged above that a significant number of
new initiatives intend job growth, but large job growth is rare and
conclusions based on the small number of respondents with high
growth ambitions are anecdotal at best. Some cases in the data with
high growth ambitions were described above. Beyond this a good share
of TEA respondents indicated products or processes new to all or most
customers. The sector distribution with lesser emphasis on consumer
services (the area where counterproductive entrepreneurship13.is
most likely to arise) than the comparable countries suggests activity in
areas favourable for innovation, especially including the “knowledge
intensive business services” (KIBS) sector. The negative aspect is the

GEM Canada Report 2014

<-----Page 71----->8. CONCLUSIONS AND
IMPLICATIONS

comparatively low level of entrepreneurial employee activity (EEA).
A key document on innovation in Canada was published in 201328 by
the Ottawa based Institute for Science and Public Policy. Developed
by a group led by Richard Hawkins, it was circulated for endorsement
by the majority of leading innovation scholars in Canada. It argues for
uniquely Canadian innovation policy noting:

67

		

“We should remember Canada’s great achievements as an

		

innovative society. Canada became an agricultural superpower

		

out of soil that Captain Palliser concluded would never grow

		

anything. The streets of Quebec gave birth to the Cirque du

		

Soleil, making Canada, of all places, the hub of a global multi-

		

billion dollar circus arts industry. The humble snowmobile gave

		

rise to one of the largest civil aviation and public transport

		

clusters in the world. Canada is one of the world’s largest

		

exporters of English and French language media content. It has

		

a thriving biotech sector. It manufactures oils out of [both] sand

		

and seeds.”

The document reminds us that innovation is not by any means
technology dominated. It also points out the merits of policy focus on
Canada’s geopolitical-economic ecosystem. This should favour policy
attention to initiatives that are ‘sticky’ to the environment and not
simply the internationally ‘hottest’ areas.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Basic R&D is strong as the Council of Canadian Academies study, The
State of Science and Technology in Canada29, shows:

GEM Canada Report 2014

		

With less than 0.5 per cent of the world’s population, Canada

		

produces 4.1 per cent of the world’s research papers and nearly

		

5 per cent of the world’s most frequently cited papers.

Council30 takes a more pessimistic view suggesting Canada is ‘treading

water’ with major concerns for business performance of Research and
Development (BERD) as a share of GDP and business investment in
Information and Communications Technologies. The NES experts are
aware of both of these views and generally give a consistent appraisal
of the entrepreneurial situation. Their main points would recommend
action to make science and technology knowledge more readily
available to small growth firms.
CULTURE AND SOCIAL NORMS
There is a curious split. The survey of the general population seems
quite positive about the opportunities, whether entrepreneurship is
a good career, and how it is treated in the media. Nevertheless, some
experts express significant reservations while others see aspects of
culture as facilitating factors. This is, perhaps, best understood in
distinguishing types of activity. The positive public attitude is probably
a mix of the sense of opportunity to start a small (local?) business

68

and admiration of the highly successful ‘celebrity entrepreneurs.
In contrast, expert opinion is more concerned about the climate of
support for a middle ground entrepreneur who is creative even if
not spectacular. Perhaps the best answer to this dichotomy is the
recommendation from Shane19. That governments sharpen their focus
on scalable, growth oriented initiatives.
