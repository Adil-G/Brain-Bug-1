<-----Page 1----->Guidelines for Measuring Trust in Organizations

By Katie Delahaye Paine

January 2003: A coalition of organizations representing 50,000 professional
communicators gathered in New Jersey to discuss ways to restore trust in American
business. Buffeted by scandal and crisis since the Enron debacle, the average citizen’s belief
in the integrity and honesty of corporate American had reached an all-time low. The
coalition agreed on three basic actions that they could recommend to each and every CEO in
America.
1. The CEO should articulate a set of ethical principles closely connected to their core
business processes and supported with deep management commitment, enterprise-wide
discipline and training.
2. The CEO should create a process for transparency that is appropriate for current
and future operations. It should include an oversight committee, culture audit and
consistent messaging. CEOs should ensure that they have professional, competent counsel
to serve as a strategic integrator, champion, bridge builder, catalyst, facilitator and record
keeper for appropriate transparency.
3. The CEO should establish a formal system of measurement, measurement of trust
a business standard for that proved benchmarking and encouraging peer pressure and CEOs
should make trust a corporate governance issue and a board priority tied to compensation
The first two are essentially process issues that are relatively easy to implement. The
third poses a problem to many corporations which has only been addressed by a few: How
to measure trust?
This document offers standard guidelines to help professional communicators answer
that question and implement the third directive of the PR Coalition.

<-----Page 2----->FOREWORD
Trust or lack thereof, has a measurable impact on the financial health of an
organization. Following the Enron scandal, its accounting firm, Arthur Anderson, was
essentially destroyed because its clients lost confidence in its results. Sales of fast foods
take a dive whenever news of tainted beef hits the airwaves causing consumers to question
the safety of their favorite burger. Conversely, a key component to FedEx’s success is
customer confidence in the company’s ability to deliver “when it absolutely positively” has to
be there in the morning.
What is disturbing is that even though we intuitively know that trust is important, we
have yet to embrace a consistent methodology to measure the trust of an organization.
Companies have relied upon customer loyalty surveys or employee morale surveys to
determine how people feel towards an organization, but there is little in the way of research
that specifically focuses on trust.
We hope that with these guidelines, organizations will agree with us that setting up a
system to measure trust in your organization is a critical component of corporate
governance.

<-----Page 3----->OVERVIEW
One of the key action items coming from the Coalition summit in January was the
need to have a single, unified approach to measuring trust. Rather than force-fitting all
programs into one system, The IPR Measurement Commission proposes a set of guidelines
that would recommend different measurement methodologies based on the type of
organization seeking to measure its trust.
This document outlines our basic definitions of trust, as well as guidelines for its
measurement. It is not intended to be a rigid set of criteria, but rather general guidelines to
ensure that we are all on the same page regarding the implementation of trust
measurement programs.
First, we understand that it is impossible to impose a single definition and measure
of a concept on everyone. Different researchers develop their own definitions of the same
concept based on their unique theorizing. If everyone could be forced to define and measure
a concept in the same way, we would lose the potential for innovation that science, in
particular, and scholarship, in general, value highly.
In addition, we do not have the ability to impose a single definition and measure on
everyone. Individual organizations have different constituencies, different objectives,
different culture, and their communications practitioners will need to develop a unique
product to measure trust with their own constituencies. In the long run, we all benefit from
this diversity of approaches because we can choose the approach that best fits our own
needs.
By taking the perspective that different system fit different organizations and
situations, we believe that we will better accomplish our goals -- to encourage more
companies to set up specific actionable and quantifiable systems for measuring and
improving trust.
DEFINITIONS: WHAT IS TRUST?
Trust has been a widely studied concept both by itself but, most importantly, as a
component of the quality of relationships. In psychology and interpersonal communication,
trust has been one of several dimensions identified in relationships. It also has been studied
extensively in business management and organizational communication—sometimes as a
single concept but, again, most often as a component of relationships. In psychology and
communication, the emphasis has been on interpersonal relationships among spouses,
friends, relatives, and the like. In business management and organizational communication,
emphasis has been on relationships among managers and between managers and other
employees.
Only recently have public relations researchers began to use similar concepts to
study organization-public relationships. The IABC document, Measuring Organizational
Trust, and the Institute for Public Relations Guidelines for Measuring Relationships both
contain extensive bibliographies that will be useful to any organization seeking to implement
a trust measurement program.
It is universally agreed that trust is a multi-dimensional concept. It is:
•

Multi-level: Trust results from interactions that span co-worker, team, organizational
and inter-organizational alliances.

<-----Page 4----->•

Culturally-rooted: Trust is closely tied to the norms, values and beliefs of the
organizational culture.

•

Communication-based: Trust is the outcome of communications behaviors, such as
providing accurate information, giving explanations for decisions and demonstrating
sincere and appropriate openness.

•

Dynamic: Trust is constantly changing as it cycles through phases of building,
destabilization and dissolving.

•

Multi dimensional: Trust consists of multiple factors at the cognitive, emotional and
behavioral levels, all of which affect an individuals perceptions of trust. has been one of
several dimensions frequently included in measurement of relationships. Since its
measurement is intrinsic to measurement of relationships, we include relationship
definitions with our definitions of trust.
Trust dimensions include:

Competence: The belief that an organization has the ability to do what it says it will
do. It includes the extent to which we see an organization as being effective; that it can
compete and survive in the marketplace.
Integrity: The belief that an organization is fair and just.
Dependability/Reliability: The belief that an organization will do what it says it will
do; that it acts consistently and dependably.
Openness and Honesty: This dimension involves not only the amount and accuracy
of information that is shared, but also how sincerely and appropriately it is communicated.
Vulnerability: The organization’s willingness, based on its culture and
communication behaviors in relationships and transactions, to be appropriately vulnerable
based on the belief that another individual, group, or organization is competent, open and
honest, concerned, reliable, and identified with common goals, norms, and values. Trust is a
complicated concept, which has several underlying dimensions.
Concern for Employees: Concern for employees includes the feelings of caring,
empathy, tolerance and safety that are exhibited when we are vulnerable in business
activities. Sincere efforts to understand contribute to high levels in any relationships.
Identification: Identification measures the extent to which we hold common goals,
norms, values and beliefs associated with our organization’s culture. This dimension
indicates how connected we feel to management and to co-workers.
Control mutuality: The degree to which parties agree on who has rightful power to
influence one another.
Although power imbalance is natural in organization: public
relationships, unilateral attempts to achieve control by one party are associated with
decreases in perceptions of communicator competence and satisfaction with the relationship
and increases in the level of activism.
For the most stable, positive relationship,
organizations and publics must have some degree of control over each other.

<-----Page 5----->Satisfaction: The extent to which one party feels favorably toward the other
because positive expectations about the relationship are reinforced. Or, a satisfying
relationship is one in which the benefits outweigh the costs. Satisfaction can also occur
when one party believes that the other party’s relationship maintenance behaviors are
positive.
Commitment: The extent to which one party believes the relationship is worth
spending energy to maintain and promote. Two dimensions of commitment are continuance
commitment, which refers to a certain line of action, and affective commitment, which is an
emotional orientation.
Finally, trust can only be considered in the broader context of the relationships an
organization has with its various publics. Therefore, one should also include the following
relationship dimensions:
•

In an exchange relationship, one party gives benefits to the other only because the
other has provided benefits in the past or is expected to do so in the future. In an
exchange relationship, a party is willing to give benefits to the other because it expects
to receive benefits of comparable value to the other. In essence, a party that receives
benefits incurs an obligation or debt to return the favor. Exchange is the essence of
marketing relationships between organizations and customers and is the central concept
of marketing theory. However, an exchange relationship often is not enough. Publics
expect organizations to do things for the community for which organizations get little or
nothing in return, that is how they develop trust. Many relationships begin as exchange
relationships and then develop into communal relationships as they mature. Often
mutually beneficial exchanges can begin to build trust, control mutuality, commitment,
and satisfaction.

•

In a communal relationship, both parties provide benefits to each other because they
are concerned for the welfare of the other—even when they get nothing in return.
Communal relationships are essential to developing and enhancing trust in an
organization. Communal relationships are important if organizations are to be socially
responsible and to add value to society as well as to client organizations. They also
greatly reduce the likelihood of negative behaviors from stakeholders mentioned
above—litigation, regulation, strikes, boycotts, negative publicity, and the like. Exchange
relationships are necessary for customers, stockholders, and suppliers. However,
exchange relationships never develop the same levels of trust and the other three
relationship indicators that accompany communal relationships. Therefore, public
relations can enhance the relationships with these stakeholders by using their unique
expertise to produce communal as well as exchange relationships.

GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING TRUST
WHAT IS TRUST MEASUREMENT?
Basically, it is any and all research designed to determine and quantify the
relationship an organization has with its various publics. Trust Measurement and evaluation
involves assessing the success or failure of much broader efforts an organization makes to
improve and enhance the relationships that organizations maintain with key constituents
More specifically, Trust Measurement is a way of giving a result a precise dimension,
generally by comparison to some standard or baseline and usually is done in a quantifiable
or numerical manner. It seeks to answer questions such as:

<-----Page 6----->•

Have the behaviors, programs and activities we implemented changed what people
know, what they think and feel about the organization, and how they actually act (as
exhibited by protests, votes and purchases).

•

Have the actions or behaviors of my organization had an impact on the trust that our
constituencies feel towards our organization?

•

Have those public relations and communications efforts that we initiated to build trust
had an impact—that is, "moved the needle" in the right direction—and, if so, how can we
support and document that with research?

MAJOR TRUST MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION COMPONENTS
For research to be credible, six components need to be considered.
1.

Define the publics with whom you have or want to have relationships.
Because trust is an element of a relationship, you need to specifically identify those
groups or individuals with whom you have or need relationships. Once those publics have
been identified, you can begin to create a system to measure your relationship with each
one.
2.

Set specific, measurable goals and objectives.
No one can really measure the effectiveness of anything without first figuring out
exactly what it is they are measuring. The communications practitioner, counselor and/or
research supplier ought to ask: What are or were the goals or objectives of the
organization? What exactly did the program or the activities hope to accomplish? The more
specific the answers, the more meaningful the research will be.
3.

Establish what you want to compare results to.
Measurement is essentially a comparative tool, and you always need something to
compare results to. Whether it is your own trust over time, or a comparison of your results
to a peer company, you must provide a benchmark and a context for the results.
4.

Select a measurement instrument and/or tool.
There is no one, simple, all-encompassing research tool, technique or methodology
that can be relied on to measure and evaluate trust. Usually, a combination of different
measurement techniques is needed. Some of the tools and techniques to measure trust
include: surveys, focus groups, before-and-after polls, ethnographic studies, experimental
and quasi-experimental designs, multivariate analysis projects, and model building.
There are many books available that discuss and describe both qualitative and
quantitative research techniques. Here are three that specifically discuss such techniques
from a public relations perspective: Using Research In Public Relations, by Glen M. Broom
and David M. Dozier (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1990); Primer of Public Relations
Research, by Don W. Stacks (New York: The Guilford Press, 2002); and Public Relations
Research For Planning and Evaluation, by Walter K. Lindenmann (available from the IPR
Commission on Trust Measurement and Evaluation, www.instituteforpr.com.)
Two useful resources for qualitative and quantitative research techniques are the
Advertising Research Foundation's two documents: "Guidelines for the Public Use of Market
and Opinion Research" and The ARF Guidelines Handbook: A Compendium of Guidelines to

Advertising Research Foundation, 641 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.
It is important to keep in mind that Qualitative Research (e.g., focus groups, one-onone depth interviews, convenience polling) is usually open-ended, free response and
unstructured in format—generally relies on non-random samples and is rarely "projectable"
to larger audiences. Quantitative Research (e.g., telephone, mail, mall, Internet, fax, and
email polls), on the other hand, although it may contain some open-ended questions, is
far more apt to involve the use of closed-ended, forced choice questions, which are highly
structured in format , generally relies on random samples and usually is "projectable" to
larger audiences.
To measure the perceptions of an organization’s relationships with key constituencies
focusing on the elements of trust as defined above we suggest administering a
questionnaire, from the up coming section – A Typical Trust Measurement Questionnaire,
that includes a series of agree/disagree statements pertaining to the relationship.
Respondents are asked to use a 1-to-9 scale to indicate the extent to which they agree or
disagree that each item listed describes their relationship with that particular organization.
5. Analyze results, make recommentions and measure again.
The process of developing and maintaining relationships with strategic publics is a
crucial component of strategic management, issues management, and crisis management.
Therefore, once you have the data from your constituencies you need to analyze it and
make recommendations as to its meaning and implications. Organizations generally make
better decisions when they listen to and collaborate with stakeholders before they make
final decisions, rather than simply trying to persuade them to accept organizational goals
after decisions are made.
First you need to identify any opposition to management goals and decisions before
it results in “issues” and “crises.” You also need to help management understand that
certain decisions might have adverse consequences on a public, so that management might
make a different decision and behave in a different way than it might have otherwise. That
is a behavioral change by management that should lead to a behavioral change by a public.
For example, the public would be more likely to accept a group home in its neighborhood,
buy a product that is now more acceptable, or support a downsizing that takes employee
interests into account. There also are times when communication helps a public to trust
management and to accept a decision that management wanted to make before
communication took place.
Since there are many times when good relationships do not lead to changes in
behavior immediately, it is important to set realistic expectations. Trust and good
relationships keep publics from engaging in negative behaviors such as litigation, strikes,
protests, or negative publicity. As a result, we have difficulty measuring a behavior that did
not occur because of a good relationship. At other times, there may be a long lag between
the development of a good relationship and a behavior—e.g., when good.
6. Determining the value of trust for public relations and organizations
When trust helps the organization build relationships with key constituencies, it
saves the organization money by reducing the costs of litigation, regulation, legislation,
pressure campaigns, boycotts, or lost revenue that result from bad relationships. A high
level of trust helps cultivate relationships with donors, consumers, shareholders, and
legislators who are needed to support organizational goals. Lower turnover of employees
has a direct impact on the bottom line. Good relationships with employees also increase the

more likely to support and less likely to interfere with the mission of the organization. Trust
from the financial community is critical to an organization’s access to capital and therefore
its ability to grow. Good relationships with the media can often avert a crisis. As you can
see, there is almost always a direct and measurable benefit to an organization when it
measures and understands its relationships with its constituencies.

QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE PUT TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMMISSION TRUST
MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION STUDIES
Here are some of the key questions that those who commission Trust Measurement
evaluation studies ought to ask themselves before they begin, and also the types of
questions that those who actually carry out the assignment ought to ask their clients to
answer before the project is launched:
--What are/were the specific goals and/or objectives of the public relations, public affairs,
and/or marketing communications program? (For example: To double the number of
inquiries received from one year to the next. To increase media coverage by achieving
greater "share of voice" in one year than in a previous year. To have certain legislation
passed. To enhance or improve brand, product, or corporate image or reputation.) Can
these be stated in a quantitative or measurable fashion
--Who are/were the principal individuals serving as spokespersons for the organization
during the communications effort?
--What are/were the principal themes, concepts, and messages that the organization was
interested in disseminating?
--Who were the principal target audience groups to whom these messages were directed?

asked to carry out a Trust Measurement and evaluation research project, before the
assignment is launched:
--What will be the actual research design or plan for the Trust Measurement and evaluation
project? Will there be a full description in non-technical language of what is to be measured,
how the data will be collected, tabulated, analyzed and reported?
--Will the research design be consistent with the stated purpose of the Trust Measurement
and evaluation study that is to be conducted? Will there be a precise statement of the
universe or population to be studied? Will the sampling source or frame fairly represent the
total universe or population under study?

evaluation project? What are their backgrounds and experience levels? Have they ever
done research like this before? Can they give references?
--Who will be doing the field work? If the assignment includes media content analysis, who
will be reading the clips or viewing and/or listening to the broadcast video/audio tapes? If
the assignments involve focus groups, who will be moderating the sessions? If the study
involves conducting interviews, who will be doing those and how will they be trained,
briefed, and monitored?

"readers," "moderators," and "interviewers" adhere to the research design and study
parameters?
--Who will be preparing any of the data collection instruments, including tally sheets or
forms for media content analysis studies, topic guides for focus group projects, and/or
questionnaires for telephone, face-to-face, or mail survey research projects? What role will
the organization commissioning the Trust Measurement and evaluation assignment be
asked, or be permitted, to play in the final review and approval of these data collection
instruments.
--Will there be a written set of instructions and guidelines for the "readers," the
"moderators" and the "interviewers"?
--Will the coding rules and procedures be available for review?
--If the data are weighted, will the range of the weights be reported? Will the basis for the
weights be described and evaluated? Will the effect of the weights on the reliability of the
final estimates be reported?
