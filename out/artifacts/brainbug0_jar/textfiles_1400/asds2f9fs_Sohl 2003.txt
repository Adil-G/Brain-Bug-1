(Final version accepted 17 October 2002)
Since the nadir of the early 1990s, the angel and venture capital markets began a rapid
recovery followed by a marked decline. These recent market gyrations offer insights into the
private equity industry. During the rise, angel and venture capital investments soared,
accompanied by rising deal valuations. For the first time since the study of angels was
initiated, venture capital investments exceed, in total dollars, the amount of angel
investments, although the number of deals remained larger in the angel market. However,
unsustainable trends inevitably return to normalcy and these changes have resulted in a
restructuring of the market. Angels are reasserting their fundamental role as the major
source of seed capital for high growth entrepreneurial ventures. This paper examines the
rise and the downturn in the private equity market, and identifies some of the causes for
each. Current and future market trends are also identified.

Introduction
The private equity market in the USA experienced much volatility over the
last decade and a half, marked by an expansionary period bookmarked by
two sharp contractions. Such volatility offers researchers a unique
opportunity to view this market through a critical lens. Taking a market
perspective, the interplay of the angel and venture capital marketÐand
their respective reactions to the market's expansion and contractionÐ
provide insights to the nature and structure of these sources of high risk
equity capital.
General studies on the characteristics, or ABCs (attitudes, behaviours
and characteristics), of angels have offered a foundation for understanding
the angel community. Research has examined the latent or potential
investor (Freear et al. 1994) and characterized the angel as an entrepreneur
(Politis and LandstroÈm 2002). In addition, the value-added quality of angel
investors, based on their prior experience as entrepreneurs, has been
identified (Mason and Harrison 1994) as has the long-term nature of the

investment horizon (Sohl 1999). With these characteristic identification
studies serving as a foundation, recent research has focused on various
specific dimensions of the angel and venture capital market segment. The
research on the investment decisionÐfrom the viewpoint of venture
capitalists (Zacharakis and Meyer 1995, 1996, Van Osnabrugge 1998),
business angels (Mason and Harrison 1996, Van Osnabrugge 1998, 2000)
and women entrepreneurs (Amatucci and Sohl 2003)Ðhas provided
insights on the process of investing. An analysis of the stages of this
decision process (Tyebjee and Bruno 1984, Van Osnabrugge 1998, Feeney
et al. 1999, Linde et al. 2000) has resulted in a taxonomy of the critical
points in the investment decision making. These critical points, or stages,
include both the pre-investment stage (Feeney et al. 1999, Kolodinsky et al.
2000, Mason and Harrison 2002a) and the post investment relationship
(Sapienza and Korsgaard 1995, Higashide and Birley 1998, Kelly and Hay
2001). Deal structureÐwith respect to the terms and conditions of angel
and venture capital deals (Sohl and Arenson-Perkins 2001) and the
theoretical context and implications of deal terms (LandstroÈm et al. 1998,
Kelly and Hay 2000)Ðhas also been analysed. With respect to outcomes,
some previous research has identified expected outcomes of angel
investments, including projected exit horizons, methods of exit and
expected rates of returns (Tymes and Krasner 1983, Mason and Harrison
1994). Recent research has begun to focus on the actual rates of return of
informal venture capital investments (Mason and Harrison 2002b) and
have concluded that trade sales are the primary harvest and that
approximately a quarter of sampled investments have an internal rate of
return in excess of 50%. As a further refinement on the angel market,
several country studies have been undertaken, including Japan (Tashiro
1999), Singapore (Hindle and Lee 2002), Sweden (LandstroÈm 1993),
Finland (Lumme et al. 1998), Australia (Hindle and Wenban 1999) and
Norway (Reitan and Sùrheim 2000).
Clearly, the research has added much to the understanding of various
components of the angel market. However, research from the inclusive,
market-based perspective, analysed during volatile periods, has not been
directly addressed, although the need for such research has been noted (de
Noble 2001). This paper analyses the angel market from a boarder
perspective: as a private equity market experiencing many changes in a
relatively short period of time. In essence, the volatility of the private
equity market throughout the 1990s and 2000 offers a good opportunity to
further knowledge and understanding of the private equity financing sector
of the economy. There is evidence that private equity contributed
significantly to the long period of economic growth in the 1990s in the
United States (Milken Institute 1999, Progressive Policy Institute 1999).
Yet, after a period of marked increase followed by a rather dramatic fall,
less is known about the private equity market in this expansionary/decline
period. This paper attempts to further knowledge and understanding of the
private equity market, especially the role of angels, during market cycles.
Specifically, the paper examines the rise and the downturn in the private
equity market, and identifies some of the causes for each. Current and
future market trends are also identified.

Market trends: the rise to 2000
As early as 1996 the angel and venture capital markets began a recovery that
was marked by a rapid rise, rather than the more measured growth that is
sustainable. The rudimentary beginnings of this new advance was in
evidence in 1994, when Jeff Bezos and a few employees created a web site
and database in Bezos's Bellevue (Washington) garage. Since the market
was still recovering and learning from the past excesses, Bezos's experience
in the search for early stage equity capital was realistic. He went looking for
capital from venture capital firms but their response became a familiar one:
good idea but, well, maybe later when the company grows. After being
introduced to some private investors, he succeeded in raising $1.2 million
from a dozen angels. A later round of $8 million was provided from
professional venture capital funds (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000).
With an IPO market beginning to demonstrate its affection for high tech
dot.coms, in May 1997 the company, Amazon.com, the Internet bookseller,
went public and provided the private equity investors and the entrepreneurs with a reasonable profit.
From this relatively quiet and little noticed beginning, angel and
venture capital investments began a steady expansion. As figure 1 indicates,
total venture capital investments increased nearly 15 fold in six years, from
$6.3 billion in 1995 to $90 billion in 2000. The number of deals funded by
the venture capital industry increased less rapidly, from 1128 deals in 1995
to 5485 in 2000, a five-fold increase, or one-third of the increase in the
dollars invested. The result of this mismatch of dollars invested and
number of deals indicated an extremely rapid rise in deal valuations.
Valuations increased, with entrepreneurs asking, and surprisingly receiving, ever increasing amounts of equity capital. During this same time
period, angel investments rose to approximately $40 billion annually in
close to 50 000 ventures, provided by over 400 000 active angels on an

annual basis (Sohl 1999). For the first time since the study of angels was
initiated, venture capital investments in the USA exceeded, in total dollars,
the amount of angel investments, although the number of deals remained
larger in the angel market. Isolated incidents of angels and venture
capitalists competing for deals were observed, but the markets still
remained, to a large extent, complementary.
A classic angel and venture capital boom was in the making. As the
dollar volume of the industry grew in size, as shown in table 1, the number
of venture capital firms increased accordingly. The number of venture
capital firms rose from 458 in 1996 to over 1000 in 2000. In keeping pace
with the increase volume in the market, the number of venture capitalists
and angels more than doubled from 1996 to 2000. More notably, the size of
individual venture capital funds grew at a rapid rate. Between 1996 and
1998, there were a total of four billion-dollar venture capital funds
(individual venture capital funds with total funds raised exceeding $1
billion) in existence. In 1999, there were nine billion-dollar funds and, by
2000, there were 19 such funds. These 19 funds in 2000 alone exceeded the
entire investments of the venture capital industry in 1994, 1995 and 1996
combined. Exacerbating the effect of these large and unwieldy funds was a
marked decrease in the time to conduct due diligence. Spurred on by the
hot IPO market and the increasing competition for deals, the pressure to
make the investments increased and the time devoted to due diligence
decreased. Due diligence became an afterthought and anecdotes of due
diligence completed in less than 10 days began to appear. The year 2000
closed with three venture-backed companies going public during the month
of December, raising $167.4 million. That brought the total number of
venture-backed initial public offerings for the year 2000 to 238 and the total
raised to $22.9 billion. In comparison, there were 22 initial public offerings
in December of 1999, raising $2 billion. The number of venture-backed
IPOs during the entire year of 1999 was 263, raising $20.5 billion. The
average issue size of the deals in 2000 was $96 million, an $18 million
increase from the $78 million average in 1999 (National Venture Capital
Association 2000).
Investment returns for venture capital funds rode the market upswing.
One-year average performance for venture funding was 38% in 1996. More
realistic returns of 31% and 20% followed in 1997 and 1998. However, 1999
saw one-year performance returns of 165% (National Venture Capital
Association 2002). Admittedly, one-year performance measures for funds
with a 10-year life are not the best measure of investment performance, but

they do give a good indication of market trends as they are occurring,
rather then at the close of a 10-year cycle. By the first half of 2000, oneyear returns fell to 42%. However, even these 42% returns are not
sustainable, given the 20-year average returns of 24%. During this same
time period, angel returns hovered in the 20 ± 40% range, more in line with
the pre market surge returns of the angel segment (Sohl and Sommer
2002).

The decline
Unsustainable trends inevitably return to normalcy. Unfortunately, after
market excesses, the return to normalcy is often severe. In 1997, there was
one Silicon Valley initial public offering per week, which minted close to 65
millionaires per day. By 2001, Silicon Valley was experiencing 4000 job
losses per month, adding 135 individuals to the ranks of the unemployed
every day. The local unemployment rate, 1.3% in 2001, had risen to 6.6% a
year later, the highest in seven years; close to 85 bankruptcies have been
filed on a daily basis during 2001. Venture capital returns, for the 12
months ending December 2001, declined to 727.8% (National Venture
Capital Association 2002). These negative returns signified the first ever
12-month negative return for the venture capital industry. Cash flow has
become critical and finding angel and venture capital dollars to maintain
companies with a reasonable chance of success is acute. Many venture
capital firms are using funds to bridge portfolio companies, rather than
adding new firms to their portfolios. A further case in point is the Silicon
Valley Fastest 50: the 50 fastest growing firms in Silicon Valley. As of the
close of 2001, 49 out of the fastest 50 have lost value, with the majority
experiencing market cap declines of 80%. Number 1 on the SV 50 list is
Transmeta, the maker of the Crusoe chip. In November 2000, Transmeta
was valued at $17 billion, selling at $50 per share. At that point, the early
seed stage investors in Transmeta were enjoying a 5400% return on their
original investments. By the third quarter, 2001, Transmeta's valuation has
declined to $215 million at $1.60 per share.
Although the dot.com implosion began in 2000, it continued and, by
some measures, even intensified in 2001. Through the end of 2001,
according to the Webmergers.com tracking service, 516 Internet companies
had shut down since the beginning of the year, compared with 225 in 2000.
The toll in 2001 included such e-commerce names as EToys and Webvan.
Shares in EToys, once the largest online toy outlet, fell from a peak of
$84.25 in October 1999 to just 9 cents in March, when the company, unable
to find new funding, finally declared them worthless and shut its site.
Webvan, the Foster City company that tried to persuade Americans to give
up the grocery store in favour of online ordering, closed in July, after
racking up $830 million in losses (Norr 2001).
The fall has not been restricted to the dot.coms. Many analysts once
arguedÐin part by analogy to the success of Gold Rush-era merchants such
as Levi Strauss, Leland Stanford and Sam BrannanÐthat companies
providing equipment, bandwidth and services for the Internet were bound

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 17:16 11 May 2009

to prosper even if many dot.coms never succeeded. But 2001 disproved that
analogy, at least for the short term. Networking-equipment giant Cisco
suffered its first quarterly loss in 11 years as a public company, largely
because it had to write off a staggering $2.2 billion worth of components it
had purchased, then found it had no use for. JDS Uniphase had to cut more
than half its workers and write off almost $50 billion for `impaired
goodwill' after demand for its fibre-optic communications gear suddenly
dried up. In July, Sun Microsystems logged its first quarterly loss in 12
years. Exodus Communications, the best-known specialist in the new field
of Web hosting, was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
began selling off its assets. A whole series of broadband Internet access
providers, whose valuations had increased in anticipation of burgeoning
demand, declined rapidly. Among DSL providers, NorthPoint Communications abruptly shut down, and rivals Covad and Rhythms entered
Chapter 11. High-speed wireless pioneer Metricom also went bankrupt and
ended up selling its billion-dollar Ricochet network for $8.25 million.
ExciteAtHomeÐthe company that created the cable-access business and
accounted for 40% of all broadband subscribersÐwent through a prolonged
agony that culminated with the suspension of service to 760 000 AT&T
subscribers and announced that it would shut down in February (Norr
2001).
The venture capital industry has indeed reacted to this new reality.
Quarterly investments by venture capital funds have (figure 2) deceased
steadily from the high of $26.2 billion in Q1, 2000, to the current rate of
$5.7 billion at the close of the second quarter of 2002 (PricewaterhouseCoopers/Venture Economics/National Venture Capital Association 2002).
This retrenchment represents over a 400% drop in investment dollars over
the last seven quarters. In Q2, 2002 the number of deals dropped to 819, a
level not seen since the 787 deals completed in Q3, 1997. At the same time,
the venture capital industry has close to $45 billion in funds that must be
put to work in private equity investments. While angel investments have
declined somewhat from the peak year of 2000, these individual investors

have the luxury to stop investing, rather than having a pool of capital that
must be invested in private equity.

The post-mortem
While the cause of the downturn in the angel and venture capital market
has many facets, a few notable factors can be discerned. First, the
proliferation of new venture capital funds, and the new fund mangers
required by the industry, added a layer of inexperience in a market filled
with uncertainty. In addition, these new participants had never witnessed a
downturn in the industry and often lacked the foresight to realize that such
downturns are distinct possibilities. The monikers angel or venture
capitalists appeared often in the media, terms that only recently were
confined to the purview of academics and a relatively small handful of
industry observers and participants. Many of these new entrants had
garnered their wealth from public equity deal making, rather than in the
private equity markets or the more traditional angel route of the cashed-out
entrepreneur. Public equity experience in isolation does not traditionally
provide the necessary background for investing in the private equity
market, for two notable reasons. First, the lack of a secondary market in
private equity investments dictates cash resolve and an understanding of
the complementarity of the angel and venture capital markets. Even if the
investment is experiencing high growth and a solid foundation, the
liquidity event is often dictated by exogenous factors including later round
investors and exit strategies, rather than the need for the investor to exit the
investment. Second, prediction of future financial performance is
confounded in the early stage equity market with the absence of any
reasonable financial history with which to base forecasts, and the lack of
audited financials. Thus, both illiquidity and the lack of financial data and a
layer of uncertainty, even for the seasoned investor, often present
insurmountable hurdles for the novice.
A second contributing factor to the downturn is that as new money
flowed into venture capital funds, individual fund sizes in excess of $500
million became the norm (National Venture Capital Association 2000).
These large funds lacked the `strike force' mentality of the traditionally
smaller, and more nimble funds, funds that were able to focus on an
industry sector that they knew best. With the increase in funds and fund
sizes, pressure to put these monies to work forced many general partners
into sectors with which they had little experience. Also, with the larger
funds and the increase in the number of deals, the value-added dimension
of venture investing became less pronounced, with many venture capitalists
stretched thin across several portfolio companies.
Third, as companies rushed to second rounds of private equity
financing, in part due to the increased availability of this capital, the
value-added start-up business experience of angel investors became
discounted. Research has indicated that business experience provided by
angels is considered by the majority of entrepreneurs just as important as
the capital provided by angels (Sohl 1999). Typically, an angel's influence

<-----Page 8----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 17:16 11 May 2009

JEFFREY E. SOHL

wanes as the company progresses to venture capital backed later rounds. In
the normal sequence, the start-up experience of the angel is not deemed as
critical as in the early stages of development. Unfortunately, these were not
normal times. These young companies, still in the critical start-up phase of
development and in acute need of angel advice, progressed quickly to later
venture capital backed rounds, whether they were appropriate or not for
their stage of development. Thus, the angels' value-added was diminished
through the rapid influx of new investors, at precisely the time that the
entrepreneur and management team needed this valuable advice.
Fourth, along with the shorter time between external equity rounds, the
entire time line from start-up to exit was abbreviated. Gone was the patient
investing that was the hallmark of the angel market. The rush to take
advantage of a red hot IPO market drove many investors, angels and
venture capitalists alike, and entrepreneurs to build `designer' companies
fashioned for an exit, rather than building a solid company.
Lastly, the inherent high failure rate in high growth ventures was
overlooked by many novice and experienced investors. The mantra `invest
what you can afford to lose' was often replaced by expectations of
unrealistic of capital gain multiples. Even in good times, good companies
fail. This, coupled with the proliferation of the designer companies,
brought many promising ventures down with the falling market.
The current market
The current market for early stage equity capital is signified by a back-tobasics mentality and recognition of the importance of angel core values.
These angel core values include patient, value-added investing on a
regional basis and usually provided by 5 ± 7 angels investing as a group
(Sohl 1999). Angels are reasserting their fundamental role as the major
source of seed capital for high growth entrepreneurial ventures. Figure 3
summarizes the current and near term future of the private equity market.
At the inception, or pre-seed stage, the venture is owner/inventor financed
through a variety of bootstrapping methods. In this context, bootstrapping
is defined as creative methods of acquiring the use of resources without
raising equity from traditional sources. Bootstrapping methods entail both
a reduction in expenses and acquisition of capital. Capital requirements are
small at this stage and as such bootstrapping presents a viable growth
strategy for the short term (Freear et al. 1995). As the venture begins to
develop, but is still in the pre-seed stage of growth, friends and families
tend to be the source of small pools of capital. At this stage, more often than
not, these are poorly structured deals typically entered into without a great
deal of due diligence. If this financing is not overburdened with terms and
conditions that may impinge on professional equity capital at a later stage,
these sources are useful to begin product development, but are not
considered to be classic investment capital (Sohl 1999).
As the entrepreneurial venture grows, so does the appetite for cash,
even in the measured growth of the post 2001 market. In the current
conditions, a realistic need for growth capital is essential. At this point, the

THE US PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET

seed and start-up phase, private investors are the major source of external
equity capital. This relatively invisible source is the oldest and largest
segment of the venture capital industry and is made up of individuals that
are self-made millionaires, typically with substantial business and
entrepreneurial experience. While many investors that entered during the
recent upswing have now exited the angel market, the size of the market
appears to be settling at a level substantially higher than before the current
surge, but lower than the apex of the recent surge. While estimates of the
scale of this informal venture capital market are difficult to ascertain with
any degree of certainty, a conservative estimate suggests that between
300 000 and 350 000 angels are investing approximately $30 billion every
year in close to 50 000 ventures (Sohl and Sommer 2002). All indications
are that the size of the informal market is stabilizing around this scale for
the near future. Estimates suggest that the number of latent or potential
self-made, private investors exceeds the number of active investors by a
factor of five to one (Sohl 1999). The typical angel deal is an early-stage
round (seed or start-up) in the $100 000 to $2 million range, raised from six
or eight investors (Sohl and Sommer 2002).
In contrast to the angel population, institutional venture capital funds,
the visible segment of the private equity market, invest primarily in later
stage and larger deals. This move to later stage represents a systemic, rather
than a reactionary trend, and is evident over the last decade. There are
approximately 1000 venture capital funds, and this number will likely
decrease slightly in the near future as funds mature and are not replaced on
a one-to-one basis. These funds currently manage about $175 billion in
investments. Venture capital funds invest between $30 and $35 billion
annually in entrepreneurial ventures and bankroll less than 3000 companies
per year. In addition, many of these financings are for ventures already in
their portfolios. A typical round of financing from a venture capital fund is
a later-stage deal in the $10 million to $15 million range, with average size

<-----Page 10----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 17:16 11 May 2009

of rounds steadily increasing (table 2). In 1994, the institutional venture
capital industry invested $2.7 billion in about 1000 companies and in 1995,
$3.8 billion in 1128 companies, or about $3.4 million per deal. In 1996, a
large increase in total investment dollars was not matched with a
proportional increase in the number of firms, with $10.1 billion invested
in 2163 companies or $4.6 million per deal. This trend continued in 1997
and 1998 with investment dollars increasing at a more rapid rate then the
number of investments. In 1999, an exponential growth in the venture
capital industry was beginning to take hold. The year 1999 saw total
venture capital investments reach $35.6 billion invested in 4006 deals.
Average investment increased to $8.9 million per deal, further cementing
this trend to later stage and larger deals that began in the early 1990s. In
2000, total dollars invested more than doubled, to close to $100 billion,
while the number of deals rose a mere 36% to 5485 deals. Average deal size
was $16.4 million for the year. Clearly, the high valuations, as noted
previously, and the move to later stage, contributed to this ballooning of the
average deal size. At the close of 2001, average deals size has receded to
approximately $9.3 million, still above levels as recent as 1999.
The funding gap: capital and information
During the market volatility throughout the 1990s and 2000, and in the
current market, a persistent funding gap has existed and a new gap has
emerged. The initial funding gap exists in the seed and start-up stage of
entrepreneurial ventures, while the second gap is in the follow-on rounds of
early stage funding. Throughout the time period studied in this paper, the
movement of the venture capital industry to larger and later stage deals,
and the continued focus of the angel market in the seed and start-up stage,
contributed, in part, these funding gaps. It appears that two market
inefficienciesÐcapital and informationÐcontribute to the existence of
these funding gaps.
To understand the contribution of the inherent market inefficiency to
the funding gaps, note that financial theory is predicated on the assumption
of efficient capital markets where there exists fully informed buyers and
sellers and low transaction costs. Under this assumption, all relevant

THE US PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET

information about sources of funds and investment opportunities is
available to all buyers and sellers of capital. For the established firm,
financial markets supply a complete variety of financing instruments, with
these markets being relatively accessible and the owner/manager is left to
decide the optimum mix of a financial structure based on the cost of capital.
For the high growth entrepreneurial firm, this supply assumption may not
hold, causing systematic market mismatches at particular stages of
development of the fast growth firm (Brophy 1997). These market
imperfections, prevalent in the informal venture capital market, lead to
two types of market inefficiencies, collectively referred to as the funding
gap.
The first market inefficiency is a capital gap between the needs of early
stage ventures and the suppliers of early stage capital. High growth
ventures need patient, value added equity capital to fuel growth. Under
efficient market conditions, capital flows from the suppliers of this capital,
angels and venture capital funds, unimpeded to the demand side, the high
tech entrepreneurs. In the USA, the private equity market does not meet
this standard of efficiency. The high-tech market has many promising
entrepreneurial ventures that do not receive the critical seed, start-up and/
or early stage capital necessary to move promising technology from the
laboratory to the marketplace. In most cases, the cost to successfully
commercialize a high tech innovation is at least 10 times the cost of the
original researchÐcosts often overlooked by the entrepreneur. One needs
to look no further than the superior technological advancements of the past
that have failed to achieve successful commercialization and market
penetration. Some of the more well known examples are: the Tucker
automobile, which in the 1940s introduced the padded dash board, disk
brakes and safety glass; the Betamax with its superior technology over the
VHS; and the Visicalc spreadsheet. There are numerous others that did not
even reach the collective consciousness beyond the scientific community.
The second, and equally important, type of market inefficiency
contributing to the funding gap is the information gap. The existence of
private investors and indications that capital is available, but quality deal
flow is lacking (Mason and Harrison 1994, Sohl 1999), tend to mitigate the
influence of the capital gap at certain stages of the development of the high
tech entrepreneurial venture. An efficient market implies an open and
timely flow of reliable information concerning financing sources and
investment opportunities. In the informal venture capital market, with the
suppliers of capital seeking a degree of anonymity, often in conflict with the
need to maintain quality deal flow, information flows very inefficiently. An
entrepreneur's search for equity capital is often a time consuming process,
resulting in missed market opportunities. Likewise, as investors seek a
balance between quality deal flow and the desire to maintain a reasonable
degree of anonymity, promising technologies are often overlooked or
prematurely discarded.
This capital and information inefficiency results in two substantial
funding gaps in the private equity market. The first gap occurs primarily in
the seed and start-up financing stage (see figure 3), and is the result of both
capital and information inefficiencies. The gap ranges from $100 000 at the

low end, the point at which the money raised from friends and families and
bootstrapping runs out, to the $2 million range on the high end, the time
when the venture would historically become attractive to venture fund
investors. It is in this seed and start-up stage that is the prime angel
territory. Research indicates that angel investors provide close to 80% of the
seed and start-up capital for high-tech entrepreneurial ventures (Sohl et al.
2000). Further evidence of the critical role of angels in financing high
growth venture is provided by the lack of attention afforded to this seed and
start-up stage by the venture capital industry. In 2000, venture capital seed
and start-up investments amounted to $1.7 billion in 238 deals, which
represents 1.7% of the total capital invested and 3.4% of the total deals. In
2001, these amounts were $843 million (2.3% of total capital) in 183 deals
(4.7% of total deals). This lack of interest in seed and start-up investments
is not a recent phenomenon. Since 1995, the percentage of venture capital
deals in the seed and start-up stage has never exceeded 10% and the total
dollars invested have never risen above 5% (PricewaterhouseCoopers/
Venture Economics/National Venture Capital Association 2002). If the
goal is public policy initiatives to spurn the commercialization of
innovation in the USA, one needs to look no further than initiatives
directed at the angel investor.
As recently as 1998 a new funding gap has emerged in the USA's equity
markets (Sohl 1999). This secondary market gap occurs in the early stage of
equity financing. As the venture capital industry has progressed to larger
and later stage financing, and the informal market has remained active
below the $2 million threshold, an ensuing capital gap in the $2 million to
$5 million range has developed. The funding gap is more of a capital gap
than the capital/information gap in the seed and start-up stage, and it has
been steadily increasing. These larger capital requirements, still considered
early stage deals, have spawned a new hybrid of angel financingÐthe angel
alliance (Cerullo and Sommer 2002, May 2002, Payne and Macarty 2002).
These alliances represent relatively large groups of business angels willing
to fund some second round, early stage deals. In addition, some of the
capital requirements in this secondary gap have been met through coinvestment between private investors and early stage financing entities.
However, both the angel alliances and the co-investment strategies do not
appear to be sufficiently satisfying the early stage equity capital needs of the
high growth sector. As such, high tech companies fortunate enough to
secure seed and start-up financing still face formidable hurdles as their
equity requirements progress to the $2 million to $5 million range. Of
course, without seed and start-up capital, many of these high tech ventures
do not even get past their initial stages of development.
The road ahead
Unsustainable expectations have been abandoned and, although angel net
worth is down, so are deal valuations by about the same percentage.
Realistic projections and realistic deal prices of early stage high tech
innovations are becoming more common. Angels are beginning to again

assert their role as value-added, patient investors in entrepreneurial
ventures. Angels continue to invest close to home with the newfound
ability to find good deals within a half days travel time. Both entrepreneurs
and investors are now striving to build companies with real value and
sustainable growth opportunities, rather than the designer companies of the
past that were built as exit strategies. It appears that investment dollars are
now being used as they should: to develop high-risk technologies with a
reasonable chance of success. Cash flow is now being used as it should, for
moving innovations from the laboratory to the marketplace. While layoffs
in the high tech sector are common, the increased skilled labour supply
offers hope. Many high tech advances and leading high tech companies are
spawned during economic down cycles, when talented labour is available at
reasonable prices. Entrepreneurship and angel investing are both alive and
well and quite active.
The role of government in the private equity market is now as
important as ever. There are several US government initiatives to enhance
the development of high tech ventures, including the SBIR programme,
Small Business Investment Corporations and the Advanced Technology
Programme (Chang et al. 2002). Each of these programmes offers unique
assistance to, and facilitation of, the development of high growth
entrepreneurial ventures. Of particular note as an active player in the
early stage market is the Advanced Technology Programme (ATP). The
ATP offers a vital component in the critical seed and start-up stage of a
technology's development, similar in many ways to the role of the angel
investor. By providing patient, early stage capital for high-risk innovations,
the ATP enables the technology innovation process through the adoption
of a long-term view of research and development. In essence, the ATP
provides the impetus for the development of high-risk technologies along
three dimensions. First, with direct financial support through its
programme of cost sharing for high tech start-ups, the ATP provides
critical funds that in many cases may not be available, even from the angel
market. Second, ATP support, in many instances, can be viewed as a form
of downside risk protection for the angel investor. The availability of ATP
funds as a form of leverage for the angel investor provides a form of cost,
and more importantly, risk sharing for the angel investor. While a deal has
much upside potential, the angel may have insufficient resources to
completely fund the project or deem the risks too high given the level of
capital that can be committed. With the ATP viewed as a form of coinvestor, the ATP funds in concert with angel capital can bring the funding
to a level that permits the accelerated development necessary to be at the
forefront of emerging markets. Third, the ATP's rigorous peer-review
system of independent evaluation assists the angel in the due diligence
process. While angels largely conduct their own due diligence, assistance in
vetting the deal through the use of independent sources is viewed as an
asset, in much the same way as angels often seek the support of other
investors to vet a deal.
In tomorrow's seed and start-up market, programmes such as the ATP
are needed more than ever. However, just as programmes such as ATP
assists in the funding of start-ups, there is an acute need for support for

research on the early stage equity funding market for high growth ventures.
Like the funding gaps that exist in the equity market for high tech ventures,
substantial knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of this critical
market.
Active and potential private investors have unique characteristics and
requirements. Uncovering incentives to bring this capital to bear on the
myriad of entrepreneurial activity sweeping the USA is a major challenge.
To this end, and to better understand the current private investor market,
longitudinal studies need to be undertaken. While surveys represent a cross
sectional `snap shot' of the market and have been the primary vehicle for
knowledge generation in angel research to date, these surveys need to be
supplemented with longitudinal research. Two key areas of longitudinal
research are currently lacking in the study of angels. First, direct research
on the market activity of angels, conducted at quarterly intervals, will offer
valuable insights on market trends. In this case, the individual angel, or
angel group, would be the unit of study. Such information would be
garnered from portals through which angels enter and participate in the
early stage market, and individual angels. A portal may best be categorized
by the predominant mechanism for bringing together entrepreneurs
seeking capital and business angels searching for investment opportunities
(Sohl et al. 2000). These portals collectively form the informal venture
capital market. Data on yield rates, valuations, size of investment, sector
information and co-investment strategies will reveal pertinent information
on the inner workings of the seed and start-up equity market.
Second, research on actual angel investment origination and conclusion
is acutely missing from the current knowledge base. In this vein, the
investment, as opposed to the angel, is the unit of study. Through the
tracking of the angel investment from the point of introduction, data on the
terms and conditions of the deal, subsequent external funding rounds, the
synergy between the angel and venture capital funded deal, actual return
rates and exit strategies, and the identification of both the successes and
failures, with each possessing valuable market information, can be
understood.
With a reasonable set of longitudinal data on angels and their
investments, critical early stage market trends can be identified and
analysed. This timely data would be used as a basis to strengthen existing
government programmes to enhance the development of high tech ventures
and to offer insights into potential public policy initiatives. Programmes
such as the ATP would be in the position to fully leverage their funding of
high-risk technology in the angel market with current data and access to the
investors that are a critical part of the market focus of ATP-funded
projects. The two longitudinal studies outlined above will not only increase
the understanding of the early stage equity market, but also serve to
educate both the entrepreneur/innovator and the angel investor. In recent
surveys, angels and entrepreneurs indicate a critical need for access to
accurate and timely market information and for assistance in some of the
technical aspects of private equity investments. These technical aspects
include research-based conclusions on conducting due diligence, negotiating deals, screening investments and pricing and structuring deals. Since

angels and entrepreneurs often operate alone, the need for reliable
information on market trends and deal structure is even more acute than
in the information overload atmosphere of the public equity markets. In
essence, with solid data collected consistently over time, programmes and
policies can take a proactive role in facilitating the equity financing of high
tech ventures. Critical questions on the angel market remain, whose
answers will help provide timely information to guide the formulation of
public policy initiatives directed at the vital role of the early stage equity
market in the continuation and strengthening of the position of the USA as
the world innovation leader.
The road ahead may be littered with mines, but the history of business
in the USA is the history of equity financing. For high tech entrepreneurs/
innovators, business history and the stock market pay tribute to the
entrepreneurs and investors who stuck it out. In the two decades of
research on informal venture capital, much has been learned. The vital role
played by business angels is being recognized, but their know-how and
their capital are still largely untapped entrepreneurial resources. The
private investor market is still largely misunderstood, inefficient and
under-researched. The more we learn about business angels, the more
research questions arise. However, by applying academic rigor to an
applied area of study, the research will continue to make progress and
provide valuable information to entrepreneurs, investors and public policy
makers. While the day when every deserving innovation will have access to
private equity, and investors will have a reasonable flow of quality
investment opportunities, is not close at hand, sustainable additions to the
understanding of the seed/start-up equity market is a goal within reach. It
is through this knowledge acquisition that nations will be well positioned to
compete in the world's innovation economy.
