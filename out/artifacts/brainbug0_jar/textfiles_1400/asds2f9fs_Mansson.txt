ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT
Based on a large database this study develops a business angel typology of early- and late-stage
investors. Early-stage investors are more entrepreneurial and less passive in giving managerial aid
to the companies invested in than are late-stage investors. Early-stage investors also seem to be
less averse to risk than late-stage investors.

<-----Page 1----->INTRODUCTION
The establishment of new firms is of vital importance for the development and growth of the
economy (Storey, 1994; Freear et al., 1995; Reynolds et al., 2003). Therefore, it is crucial to
stimulate the emergence of companies, and in this respect the availability of financial resources is
one of many factors that can be of importance for the creation of new firms (Lumme et al., 1998;
European Commission, 2002). However, in the seed and start-up phases of company
development financial resources are limited. Factors that may hamper investments in early-stage
ventures are the uncertainty inherent in the process, at least in more innovative ventures, and the
information asymmetry that may be present in the relationship between the entrepreneur and
investor.
Earlier research (Mason & Harrison, 1995; Coveney & Moore, 1998) has shown that while
institutionalised capital, such as venture capital funds and banks, has been turning its back on
high-risk investments in seed and start-up stages of firm development, informal investors, i.e.
individuals investing capital in unquoted companies to which the investor has no family
connection, have become increasingly important for young firms and it has been argued that
informal venture capital has the ability to fill the ‘equity capital gap‘ in early phases of
development (Mason & Harrison, 1992).
When studying the individuals making informal investments in more detail, it has repeatedly
been shown that the informal venture capital market is heterogeneous (Mason & Harrison,
1992; Landström, 1993). To be able to cope with this some attempts have been made to divide
this group of investors into different subgroups in order to find common characteristics (e. g.
Gaston 1989; Freear et al., 1994; Kelly & Hay, 1996; Sullivan & Miller, 1996; Coveney &
Moore, 1998; Sørheim & Landström, 2001; Avdeitchikova’s, 2005). Sørheim & Landström’s
(2001) and Avdeitchikova’s (2005) models are similar to each other in dividing the informal
investors’ market into four categories of investors depending on their degree of investment
activity and investor involvement. Based on these two studies, the four types of informal
investors are: ‘traders’, ‘micro-investors’, ‘mentors’ and ‘business angels’. In this paper we will
focus on one particular group of informal investors, namely the ‘business angels‘, i.e. investors
who repeatedly make informal investments and, apart from being active from a financial point of
view, also contribute to the management of the company in which they have invested. However,
even within the category of business angels we find a high degree of heterogeneity among

2

<-----Page 2----->investors. This heterogeneity has made it difficult to analyse the business angel community and it
has hence been argued that more research is required to identify angel typologies as well as
research focusing on specific types of investors (Mason & Harrison, 2000). The high degree of
heterogeneity among business angels does, however, according to Mason & Harrison (2000),
mean that studies attempting to identify typologies are in need of large and unbiased samples in
order to succeed.
The creation of business angel typologies is thus desirable from a theoretical perspective, but
these typologies must be based on a sound methodological base in order to be successful. As this
study is based on a database that is both relatively large and relatively unbiased it is likely that it
will be possible to distinguish between different types of business angels.
In addition, it is known that business angels tend to invest in industries and technologies of
which they have experience (MacDonald, 1991), and business angels’ backgrounds can hence be
said to influence their investment preferences. On the one hand, this implies that business angels
would primarily be interested in well-tried technologies and existing industries, and not in
innovations and changes in industrial structures. However, on the other hand, as many investors
have an entrepreneurial background (Mason et al., 1991; Harrison & Mason, 1992; Landström,
1997; Lumme et al., 1998; Brettel, 2003) the entrepreneurial process in itself may be regarded by
some business angels as their key area of competence. Thus, it may be appropriate to differentiate
between business angels who prefer early-stage investments, as they believe that knowledge of the
entrepreneurial process is most important, and business angels who prefer to invest at later stages
as they believe, for instance, personal experience of the industry or technology in question to be
most important.
Due to the importance of stimulating new firms in an economy, and the equity capital gap that
we can identify in the early stages of many firms’ development it would be of crucial importance
to be able to identify the business angels who preferably invest in companies at early stages. In
other words, if there are stage preferences among investors it would be useful to know whether
the two groups differ, and if it is possible to identify early-stage investors and discriminate them
from late-stage investors, something that would be useful from both a theoretical and policymaking perspective.

3

<-----Page 3----->In light of the usefulness of the ability to discriminate between early- and late-stage business
angels, and the possibility offered by a large and relatively unbiased sample, the aim of this study
is to analyse differences and similarities between early- and late-stage investors regarding their
expectations and background.
The paper begins with a frame of reference in which informal venture capital and business angels
are described. The development of hypotheses is followed by a methodological discussion and
presentation of the empirical results. Finally the conclusions of the study are presented.

FRAME OF REFERENCE
Mason & Harrison (2000) have reviewed the research within the field of informal venture capital
and business angels, and divided the research into first- and second-generation studies.
FirstFirst- generation studies
Seminal work by Wetzel initiated the focus on informal investors in the early 1980s (Wetzel,
1981; 1983). Since then, we have seen the diffusion of research into a number of countries
around the world, among them Canada (Riding et al., 1993), the UK (Harrison & Mason, 1992;
Coveney & Moore, 1998), Sweden (Landström, 1993), Finland (Lumme et al., 1998), Australia
(Hindle & Wenban, 1999), Singapore (Hindle & Lee, 2002), the Netherlands (K+V organisatie
adviesbureau, 1996), Japan (Tashiro, 1999) and Norway (Reitan & Sørheim, 2000). Thus,
research on informal investors is rather young and in order to get a picture of the market
researchers have considered it important to quantify and describe the informal investor market.
This means that a large proportion of the literature discusses matters such as the size of the
market, investor characteristics, decision processes, information channels, and the initiatives
intended to stimulate the informal venture capital market.
Comparing demographical data from first-generation studies in the search for differences and
similarities between different countries can be misleading for several reasons: (i) different
sampling methods and different questions are used in different studies, (ii) confusion between
the definitions of business angels and informal venture capital may lead to incorrect conclusions,
(iii) studies have been carried out over different time periods during which significant changes

4

<-----Page 4----->have taken place in the macro-environment, and (iv) business angels are a heterogeneous group
and comparisons based on average values may not give the complete picture.
In despite of the above mentioned difficulties in comparing different studies some characteristics
recur frequently (Gaston, 1989, Mason et al., 1991; Harrison & Mason, 1992; Landström 1993;
Lumme et al., 1998; Reitan & Sørheim, 2000; Vaekstfonden, 2002; Hindle & Lee, 2002;
Brettel, 2003). Earlier research, has, for instance, shown that business angels are predominantly
male and that they are middle-aged. The average business angel, furthermore, shows profound
entrepreneurial experience as the majority of them have started at least one company. The
business angels’ informal network is of importance when identifying new investment
opportunities, and information on new investment opportunities is often provided by business
associates and friends. However, contacting entrepreneurs also seems to be becoming increasingly
important, as seen in later studies. Business angels, furthermore, prefer to invest in relatively close
proximity of their home.
First-generation studies have, however, also revealed significant differences between the business
angels’ market in different countries. Business angels usually play an active role in the
management of the companies in which they have invested, but in the cases of Norway and the
UK business angels are often passive in their ownership. A high degree of syndication can explain
why business angels remain passive as not all of the investors involved have to be active, but the
degree of business angel passivity in the UK is further enhanced by the fact that the UK market is
the only market in which less than half of the investors have experience of making syndicate
investments. However, if business angels are active, it seems to be a general characteristic that
they become involved in companies through taking a position on the board of directors or by
functioning as a consultant. Another difference is that Japanese and, to some extent, American
investors more often take the majority of votes when investing in a company, whereas business
angels in other countries usually take a minority share of stocks. Other differences that can be
observed are that Swedish business angels show little interest in early stages, while German and
American investors, on the other hand, seem to prefer early stages. Furthermore, Japanese and
Scandinavian business angels seem to be slightly older than their counterparts in other countries
(Gaston, 1989, Mason et al., 1991; Harrison & Mason, 1992; Landström 1993; Lumme et al.,
1998; Reitan & Sørheim, 2000; Vaekstfonden, 2002; Hindle & Lee, 2002; Brettel, 2003).

5

<-----Page 5----->SecondSecond -generation studies
Second-generation studies show increasing sophistication compared to first-generation studies
and can be grouped into three different categories of studies (Masons & Harrison, 2000). The
first category is concerned with studies introducing theoretical perspectives. The perspectives
examined are related to several aspects of informal investments. The business angels’ investment
decisions have been studied in the light of decision, theory whereas economic approaches have
been used to explain the investors’ motives. The relationship between entrepreneur and investor
has been investigated through agency theory, which has led critics to use theories of trust as an
alternative. The second category consists of studies focusing on policy issues, where a large part of
research with policy implications has been related to Business Angel Networks (BANs) and the
way they can contribute to a more efficient market for informal venture capital. Some research
has also been related to government interventions, for instance, tax reforms aimed at making
informal investments more attractive. The third group of studies covers some new topics of the
informal investment phenomenon such as: (i) the complementarity of formal and informal
venture capital, (ii) the relationship between investor and entrepreneur, (iii) investors’ risk return
and holding periods have been carried out, and (iv) the investment decision making.
Thus, one topic that has emerged in research over the past couple of years is the business angels’
decision-making criteria. These criteria are often structured through dividing the screening
process into four phases: (1) first impressions, (2) the initial assessment, (3) analysis and (4)
negotiation (Riding et al., 1993; Dal Cin et al., 1995; Riding et al., 1995). Most investment
cases are rejected as early as in the first phase, in which the business angel lets his first impressions
guide him regarding whether the proposition should be further investigated or rejected
(Landström, 1998). The decision is often based on predetermined preferences, which in turn are
based on the business angel’s previous experience (MacDonald, 1991). This means that business
angels to some extent let their own background influence their investment-making decision. The
business angels’ decision-making process and their demographics are hence interrelated and
literature focusing on the decision-making process is therefore relevant in this study although the
empirical data are primarily related to the business angels’ demographics.
Hypothesis development
A large proportion of business angels have entrepreneurial experience (Harrison & Mason, 1992;
Landström, 1993 ; Landström, 1997) and one of the factors that has been identified as
motivating business angels is being able to relive earlier entrepreneurial experiences (Aram, 1989;

6

<-----Page 6----->Sullivan & Miller, 1996; Landström, 1997). Taking this further, it may be assumed that an
investor investing at an early stage has a stronger urge to once again experience entrepreneurial
processes than a late-stage investor. Since early-stage development must be regarded as more
entrepreneurial and later stages more managerial,, early-stage investors could be expected to have
a more entrepreneurial background. Furthermore, informal investments are high-risk
investments and the risk is regarded as being higher at the early stages. One method of managing
this risk is through one’s own experience from the specific market and the process of
entrepreneurship itself (Kelly & Hay, 1996). This suggests that early-stage investors may have a
stronger entrepreneurial background than late-stage investors.
The importance of prior experience is also emphasised as business angels regard it to be
important to have knowledge and an understanding of the technologies and the industries in
which the company is working (MacDonald, 1991). This means that business angels can easily
become conservative and prefer well-tried markets and technologies to untested technologies and
new markets. However, as indicated by Kelly & Hay (1996), business angels with a high degree
of entrepreneurial experience may regard their capacity to adapt to a changing environment of
new markets and new technologies to be central, and therefore regard the entrepreneurial process
to be their key area of competence. This means that early-stage investors not only ought to have
greater experience of starting companies, as suggested in hypothesis 1a, but also greater
experience of fast-moving and entrepreneurial industries building on new technologies in which
constant and rapid development is part of the environment, such as IT and telecommunications.
Hypothesis 1a:

Early-stage investors have more often started at least one company than late-stage
investors.

Hypothesis 1b:

Early-stage investors more often have experience of fast-moving industries than latestage investors.

As an early-stage investment is riskier than a late-stage investment it is less suitable to place a
large proportion of one’s personal wealth in early-stage informal investments. Assuming financial
rationality among business angels, this means that early-stage investors would have a smaller
share of their portfolio in informal investments than late-stage investors, since early-stage
investments are often smaller than late-stage investments (Mason & Harrison, 1994). Aram
(1989) found some evidence for this reasoning when establishing that investors solely investing

7

<-----Page 7----->in start-ups invested fewer dollars than other investors. This means that it is also probable that
early-stage investors have less capital invested in unquoted companies than late-stage investors.
An alternative is that the amount invested is the same, but that early-stage investors have more
unquoted companies in their portfolio than late-stage investors in order to achieve a larger degree
of diversification.
Hypothesis 2a:

Early-stage investors invest a smaller share of their portfolio in informal venture
capital than late-stage investors.

Hypothesis 2b:

Early-stage investors invest smaller amounts of informal venture capital than latestage investors.

Hypothesis 2c:

Early-stage investors have more unquoted companies in their portfolio than latestage investors.

Since it is almost impossible to conduct a systematic due diligence of an early-stage company,
early-stage investments must be deemed more risky than late-stage investments (Mason &
Harrison, 1992), and as a consequence early-stage investments more often lead to losses (Mason
& Harrison, 2000). Hence the compensation for early-stage investments should be higher than
for late-stage investments. In practice the risk premium on early-stage investments implies that
the same amount invested should render a higher share of stocks in an early-stage investment
than in a late-stage investment. Furthermore business angels’ tendency to manage risk through
managerial involvement means that early-stage investors making more risky investments should
strive to obtain relatively late-stage investors higher proportion of stocks in order to have a
stronger controlling influence on the company. (Kelly & Hay, 2001; Freear et al., 2002; Mason
& Harrison, 2002)
Hypothesis 3: Early-stage investors take a larger share of stocks than late-stage investors when
investing in a company.
Kelly & Hay (2001) give support for the fact assumed in many studies that business angels
manage their risk through active involvement in the management of the company in which they
have invested. This phenomenon has been explained in terms of agency theory and is associated
with the business angel’s ambition to avoid that the entrepreneur gives way to opportunistic

8

<-----Page 8----->behaviour. It has also been suggested in the literature that early-stage companies have greater
needs of additional management skills, leading to the assumption that early-stage investors are
more involved in the companies they have invested in than are late-stage investors.
Hypothesis 4: Early-stage investors play a more active role in the company they have invested in than
late-stage investors.
The market for informal venture capital is imperfect, with considerable information asymmetry.
Sellers often have more information than buyers as public information about small unquoted
companies is finite, creating a situation in which it is difficult to harvest an investment as
potential buyers are deterred from investing due to a lack of information. It is known that earlystage investments more often lead to total loss (Mason & Harrison, 2000), but whether it takes
longer to harvest an early-stage investment is not known. It does, however, seem reasonable to
assume that early-stage investments require a longer holding period before having gained a
sufficiently stable and strong position to sell the company, for instance, to an industrial buyer or
to a formal venture capital company.
Hypothesis 5: Early-stage investors expect longer holding periods than late-stage investors.

METHODOLOGY
Sample
Trying to sample a Business Angel population is a process with inherent difficulties. There are no
registers or public records of informal venture capitalists. Since it is expensive to identify
sufficient numbers of investors through random selection among the public, Harrison & Mason
(1992) suggest three different methods of identifying informal investors: (i) send questionnaires
to a large number of individuals believed to be investors; (ii) contact investors through the
companies they have invested in, and (iii) identify investors using the ‘snowball’ method in
which identified investors are asked to identify their peers. Each of these methods has drawbacks
that make samples obtained non-representative and biased in one way or another. Often the
method employed in different research projects is chosen for convenience, for example, investors
are contacted through different BANs or through snowball methods.

9

<-----Page 9----->One method of making the sample more representative is to combine several different methods
of finding business angels with the hope of offsetting the bias (Sørheim & Landström, 2001). In
this study members of twelve different BANs with different geographical locations and different
operational procedures were sent questionnaires. The fact that almost all of the BANs were newly
created is an advantage when trying to avoid bias since the BAN will not yet have had time to
affect its members in their investment procedures. The second method of finding investors was
trough the Swedish Patent and Registration Office’s (SPRO) company register in order to search
for members of boards whose first names and surnames in combination with ‘Investment AB’
also make up a company name. Thirdly, investors were identified through companies known to
have received venture capital, through articles in newspapers and business magazines, as well as
through the snowball method where bankers, entrepreneurs, solicitors and not least business
angels themselves have identified informal investors. The number of investors identified from
different sources is given in Table 1.

Survey process
In total, 894 questionnaires were sent out during the winter of 2003-2004, 400 of which have
been returned (45%). Some 122 of the respondents had not yet made any investments or did not
want to take part in the study, leaving 278 respondents (31%) who had invested in unquoted
companies to which they had no family connection. After having processed the questionnaires in
order to find early- and late-stage investors, as described below, 212 or 24% of the respondents
remained for further analysis within this study.
The ten-page questionnaire based on earlier studies by Harrison & Mason (1992) and
Landström (1993), as well as a study of formal venture capital carried out by the Swedish
Business Development Agency (NUTEK) and the Swedish Private Equity & Venture Capital
Association (SVCA), consists of 47 questions of different length taking in total about 30 minutes
to answer. The questions concern demographical data such as education, age and financial

10

<-----Page 10----->aspects, previous investment history including a section on the most recent investment, and
sections regarding investments during the past year as well as preferences regarding future
investments.
If the respondent had not answered within three weeks s/he was sent a new questionnaire and a
letter reminder. This procedure was repeated again after a further three weeks if an answer had
still not been received. The questionnaire was accompanied by a cover letter from the BAN if the
respondent was a member of such an organization.
In order to evaluate the non-response bias, the three groups of respondents answering the first,
second or third questionnaire sent to them were compared. The basis for this comparison was
that late respondents are expected to show similar characteristics to non-respondents (Armstrong
et al., 1977). It was found that the proportion of respondents not having made informal
investments rose significantly with each reminder sent. It was also found that early respondents
invested more often through a company privately owned or through a company partly owned,
which can be related to Swedish tax regulations favouring informal investments being made
through companies. This means that investors investing through companies ought to be viewed
as more structured and professional than those not investing through companies. Other
significant differences between early and late respondents also supported the assumption that
respondents are more active than non-respondents since early respondents had invested in larger
numbers of companies than late respondents. Taken together, this information indicates that
more active investors are over-represented in the survey.
Identification of earlyearly - and latelate- stage investors
Early-stage and late-stage investors were identified by asking whether their most recent
investment was made in a company that was in the seed-stage, start-up-stage, expansion-stage, or
if it was a buy-out. If the investment was made in a seed or start-up company the investor was
categorised as an early-stage investor, if on the other hand, the investment was made at the
expansion stage or if the investment was a buy-out, the investor was categorised as a late-stage
investor. In total 112 early-stage investors were identified and 100 late-stage investors. The large
proportion of early-stage investors was surprising, as the Swedish business angel market has been
characterised by a high degree of late-stage investments (Landström, 1993), but can be explained
by the tendency of Swedish business angels to become more early-stage oriented (Månsson &
Landström, 2005).

11

<-----Page 11----->In order to verify that the most recent investment constituted an appropriate variable for
categorising investors into early- and late-stage investors, it was compared with stage preferences
for future investments. It was found that early-stage investors were significantly more willing to
invest at early stages than were late-stage investors (p=0.002 Seed, p=0.000 Start-up). Late-stage
investors are also significantly more likely than early-stage investors to make future investments
in expansion-stage companies (p=0.000) while the greater preference for future buy-outs was not
significant (p=0.365). In spite of this, buy-out investors have been characterized as late-stage
investors since it can be argued that companies that are acquired through buy-outs have reached
later stages. Furthermore, when testing what would happen if buy-out investors were excluded
from the group of late-stage investors an analysis showed that no significant differences were
found when they were included. The trait of early-stage investors being positively inclined
towards continuing to invest in early stages has also been established by Aram (1989). The
statistical analysis software SPSS was used to analyse the collected data, mainly for chi-squared
tests to test the significances of the difference between early- and late-stage investors.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
Compared with earlier research, this study has three methodological aspects in its favour. The
sample is a mixture of different subsamples originating from different contexts, meaning a less
biased sample, although the sample can still not be regarded as strictly representative of the
population. The sample is large compared with many other studies (Sørheim & Landström,
2001), and the response rate is quite good since most studies achieve an unprocessed response
rate of about 20%, mainly due to the fact that informal investors tend to value their privacy
(Mason & Harrison, 2000).
Although the sample in this study is probably less biased than other samples, it is difficult to tell
in what way the present sample is biased. It is probably not representative from a geographical
point of view since most BANs used to sample the population are found in more densely
populated areas rather than in rural areas. It is also probable, although not known, that high-netincome individuals are over-represented since they are more likely to appear in newspapers and
magazines.

<-----Page 12----->EMPIRICAL RESULTS
The business angel market in Sweden
Small firms in Sweden have shown that they are reluctant to accept external equity finance as
only 3% of small firms receive financing from informal venture capital, and 5% from formal
venture capital. Instead, small firms in Sweden rely heavily on bank financing as an external
source of funds, and as much as 86% of companies rely primarily on capital received from banks
(Landström & Winborg, 1995). This dependency on bank financing, compared with for
instance small firms in the USA, is probably related to the fact that the two countries’ financial
systems are based on different traditions. On the one hand, the Swedish system is a credit-based
financial system, in which bank lending holds a central position, a system also employed in
continental European countries such as Germany, Austria and France. The USA and UK, on the
other hand, have a market-based system in which equity finance, through for instance stock
exchanges and venture capital, holds a strong position (Gerschenkron, 1966 in Zackrisson,
2003). However, there are reasons to believe that the Swedish financial system is becoming more
capital-market-based and hence more equity oriented. Månsson & Landström (2005) for
instance show that the internet hype is likely to have drawn more attention to the informal
venture capital market in Sweden.
Although increased attention to informal venture capital investments has attracted new investors,
the Swedish business angel can, as in many other countries, still be described as a highly
entrepreneurial, middle-aged man, who has started on average 3.51 companies. This, and the fact
that the results also reveal that a large share, or 52%, of business angels have made their wealth
through selling a company, supports Politis & Landström’s (2002) conclusion that making
informal investments is part of an entrepreneurial journey.
In addition, results show that Swedish business angels have invested a median of 2 million SEK
in an average of 4.11 portfolio companies. From a historical perspective, the portfolio has been
built up through repetitive investments, and during the previous five years the average business
angel has invested in 4.71 companies. As a high proportion of these investments consists of
syndicate investments, in which more than one investor is participating (77%), syndication
partly explains why as many as 51% of the investments being made render a share of stocks less
1

Extreme values have been neglected.

13

<-----Page 13----->than 10%, and that as many as 24% of business angels are passive in their most recent
investment. However, with 30% of business angels becoming involved as chairman of the board
and 33% as a member of the board, they generally play an active role in the management of
companies in which they have invested. These roles are furthermore often combined with help
given in the capacity of a consultant or as a mentor. However, despite the fact that active
involvement in the portfolio companies has been seen as a way of reducing investment risk,
making informal investments is a high-risk venture in which the amount invested is expected to
be tied up for an average of 5.6 years, and it is therefore understandable that business angels only
invest 12% of their fortunes in informal investments.
Test of hypotheses stated
In hypothesis 1a it was stated that early-stage investors have a more entrepreneurial background
than late-stage investors. The results show that, just as expected early-stage investors have, to a
higher degree than late-stage investors, started at least one company (see Table 2). The difference
is significant (p=0.019) but at the same time it must be observed that in both groups the vast
majority had started companies, 95% of early-stage investors and 85% of late-stage investors.

Another dimension when investigating to what extent investors have started companies is to
study how many companies they have started. It was found that late-stage investors had started
on average 3.4 companies, while early-stage investors had started 3.7 companies, showing signs
that early-stage investors do start more companies than late-stage investors, but the difference was
not significant (p=0.419).
In hypothesis 1b it was stated that early-stage investors have experience of fast-moving industries,
such as ‘telecom and electronics’, to a greater extent than late-stage investors. Many respondents
had experience of several different industries (see Table 3). This makes it difficult to identify any
major differences between the two groups when comparing their industrial background. The

14

<-----Page 14----->only significant difference found is within telecom and electronics, where early-stage investors are
more experienced, 30%, than late-stage investors, 18% (p=0.037). However, industries such as
computer and biotechnology showed no significant difference. As other differences for other
industries were not significant the observed differences for telecom and electronics only partly
support the hypothesis that early-stage investors have more experience in fast-moving,
entrepreneurial industries than late-stage investors.
Regarding the overall results of entrepreneurial experience, early-stage investors have experience
of starting at least one company significantly more often than late-stage investors. The observed
difference for serial entrepreneurs, that early-stage investors had started more companies, was
however not significant. Concerning previous industrial experience, early-stage investors more
frequently have experience of telecommunications and electronics, rendering only partial support
for the hypothesis that early-stage investors have a more entrepreneurial industrial background
than late-stage investors.

Whether early-stage investors have less capital invested in informal venture capital investments
than late-stage investors is a question that can be investigated in both relative and absolute terms.
Starting with relative terms, it is stated in hypothesis 2a that early-stage investors have a smaller
proportion of their wealth invested in informal venture capital than late-stage investors. Results
show that early-stage investors place 10% of their wealth in informal investments, while latestage investors place a slighter higher proportion (13%) of their investments in informal
investments, however, the difference is not significant (p=0.458).

15

<-----Page 15----->In absolute terms it is stated in hypothesis 2b that early-stage investors invest smaller amounts of
informal venture capital than late-stage investors. The investors were asked to state the amount
they had invested in unquoted companies to which they lack family connections. Since a few
investors had invested very large amounts they would influence any comparison of the average
amount invested for early and late investors. Hence the amounts of money invested have been
divided into six different intervals (see Table 4). The results reveal that, although early-stage
investors have small amounts invested (up to 0.5 million SEK) to a greater degree than late-stage
investors,

the two groups of investors cannot be significantly separated from each other

(p=0.611), nor can the medians be used to differentiate the groups since both groups stated that
they had invested 2 million SEK in informal investments. This means that late-stage investors do
not invest more informal venture capital in absolute or in relative terms.
When testing hypothesis 2c which states that early-stage investors have more unquoted
companies in their portfolio than late-stage investors, it was found that early-stage investors had
4.0 unquoted companies in their portfolio and late-stage investors 4.2. The difference is not
significant (p=0.696), but as early-stage investors have a smaller portfolio than late stage investors
this indicates that the opposite may be true to what was believed in the hypothesis.

To summarise the results regarding the amounts invested and diversification of the investors’
portfolios, early- and late-stage investors not only invest roughly the same amounts, in terms of
their private wealth, they also invest the same amounts in absolute terms. As early-stage
investments are of higher risk than late-stage investments, and early-stage investors do not
diversify to a greater extent than late-stage investors, early-stage investors must be deemed to be

16

<-----Page 16----->less averse to risk than late-stage investors, unless early-stage investors are compensated for their
higher risk or can reduce their risk level in some other way.
Hypothesis 3 states that early-stage investors take a larger share of the stocks than late-stage
investors when investing in a company. A comparison of the two groups of investors, with regard
to the share taken, shows that early-stage investors more often take a larger share than late-stage
investors (see Table 5). However, the difference between the two groups is not significant
(p=0.434) and the hypothesis has not been proven.

It was stated in hypothesis 4 that early-stage investors are more active in the management of their
investments in order to offset the higher risk taken. As shown in Table 6, early-stage investors are
passive investors in 16% of cases compared with 32% for late-stage investors, a significant
difference (p=0.006). However, as far as the different active roles played by the two groups are
concerned, the differences are not significant, but early-stage investors show strong signs of being
more active as they are active to larger extent as members of the board (37% vs. 28%, p=0.183)
and as consultants (25% vs. 18%, p=0.219). Taken active and passive roles together, early-stage
investors seem to be somewhat more active than late-stage investors.
Although not directly upholding the hypothesis there are also other variables that can be used to
analyse whether late-stage investors are less active than early-stage investors. Late-stage investors
more often invest as part of a syndicate than early-stage investors (83% vs. 72%, p=0.074), and as
it is often the case that not all investors in a syndicate are active this indicates that early-stage
investors are more active in the management of portfolio companies than late-stage investors.
Although not significant, the larger degree of syndication of late-stage investors hence partly

17

<-----Page 17----->explains why late-stage investors are more passive than early-stage investors. Early-stage investors
also show significantly greater preference (p=0.033) for making investments closer to home than
late-stage investors, as 64% of early-stage investors prefer to invest within 300 kilometres of their
home, while the equivalent figure for late-stage investors is 38%. As the remaining investors do
not think that distance is of importance this indicates that early-stage investors prefer to be in
closer contact with the companies they invest in.

To summarise, the test of hypothesis four and five, early-stage investors seem to take a larger
proportion of shares in the companies they have invested in, but the difference is not significant.
Early-stage investors are, however, less passive and probably also more active. The greater activity
may be an attempt to reduce the overall risk in the early-stage investors’ portfolios, but at the
same time it can be argued that early-stage investors should be rewarded for the extra time
devoted to the company; however, as the difference in share taken was insignificant it is not
possible to argue that this is the case.
Hypothesis 5 states that investors investing at early stages believe their investments to be tied for
a longer time, but the difference is not significant (p=0.216), with early-stage investors on average
expecting a holding time of 6.0 years and late-stage investors expecting on average a holding time
of 5.1 years. It is important to bear in mind that an experienced business angel will know that
some companies invested in will go bankrupt, and that this is more likely in the case of early
investments (Mason & Harrison, 2002). After being engaged in a company for a while the
business angel may expect a shorter holding period due to an unavoidable and foreseeable future
bankruptcy. In this study, for instance, already after an average of about one year from
investment, 13% early-stage investments and 9% late-stage investment companies had gone
bankrupt.

18

<-----Page 18----->CONCLUSIONS
In an attempt to go beyond what Mason & Harrison (2002) called the first-generation studies,
and to establish a typology of business angels, the aim of this work was to study business angels
who prefer to invest at early and late stages. We have succeeded in showing that business angels
making early-stage investments will also continue to invest at early stages to a large extent, while
late-stage investors, on the other hand, will probably continue to invest at late stages, i.e. the
categories of business angels seem to be stable over time. Although a theoretically valid typology
has been established, as called for, for instance, by Mason & Harrison (2000), it was interesting
to find that the differences between the two categories were less than we expected. This can
probably be explained by business angels being a heterogeneous group of investors demanding a
database even larger than the one available in order to find statistically significant differences
through offsetting the effect of heterogeneity. However, we have found some interesting results
when comparing the two groups of investors.
Early-stage investors have, as expected, proven to be more entrepreneurial as they have
started at least one company significantly more often than late-stage investors, and earlystage investors also show signs of more often being serial entrepreneurs. Early-stage
investors also have previous experience of the fast-moving telecom and electronics
industry to a larger extent than late-stage investors, indicating that they are used to a
constantly changing business environment.
As early-stage investments must be regarded as more high risk than late-stage
investments it was expected that early-stage investors would be more cautious in their
investments and invest smaller amounts as well as diversifying to a greater extent.
However, early-stage investors do not invest a significantly smaller proportion of their
wealth in informal investments, and both groups of investors seem to invest roughly the
same amounts. As early-stage investors do not diversify to a greater extent than late-stage
investors, this means that early-stage investors take greater risks than late-stage investors,
and they may therefore be less averse to risk than late-stage investors. In addition, there
is no significant difference in the amount of stocks taken by early- and late-stage
investors.
Early-stage investors are less passive in the management of a company in which they
have invested than late-stage investors, and early-stage investors also show several signs of

19

<-----Page 19----->being more active than late-stage investors. Early-stage investors, furthermore, prefer to
invest closer to home than late-stage investors.
Having established that both groups invest about the same amounts in about the same number
of companies it was unexpected to find that early-stage investors only showed signs of taking a
larger share of the company than late-stage investors. Either early-stage investors are less averse to
risk than late-stage investors, or the results should be interpreted as showing that the risk
premium for investing at early and late stages is assessed by the investors to be about the same.
The latter would be surprising since it is often assumed that early-stage investments are more
high risk than late-stage investments, but it may be that early-stage investors are able to
compensate in some way for the greater risk taken. One way of doing this, which was observed,
may be through being less passive than late-stage investors thus reducing the risk through active
involvement in the company invested in, i.e. the lack of management involvement by late-stage
investors may make late-stage investments as risky as early-stage investments. A higher degree of
involvement ought to lead to greater compensation for the extra effort, however, it could not be
proven that early-stage investors take a greater amount of shares than late-stage investors. This
leads us to the conclusion that early-stage investors either reduce their risk through other
measures than the ones observed in this study, for instance making greater use of resources in
their personal networks, or they are less averse to risk. It could, however, also be that early-stage
investors are compensated for their extra effort in some other way, for instance through the
satisfaction derived from investing at early stages. If this is the case, it would probably be possible
to find differences in the motives of the two groups. It may, for instance, be that early-stage
investors are driven by the possibility to be part of an entrepreneurial journey to a greater extent
than late-stage investors.
The primary theoretical contribution of this study has been to establish that there are two
distinct groups of business angels: early- and late-stage investors. Empirical differences have been
observed, such as early-stage investors being more entrepreneurial as well as less passive than latestage investors. However, unexpected similarities also indicated differences in the two groups’
perception of risk. It may be that there are differences in their motives for making investments in
unquoted companies, but it may also be that there are differences in the groups’ ways of handling
risk, for instance the way in which business angels in the two groups use their personal networks
in the investment process in order to reduce the risk. Both reasons, however, speak for future use

20

<-----Page 20----->of in-depth studies in order to clarify what drives business angels to prefer early-stage
investments.
From the results of this study we can draw the conclusion that in order to support young
ventures business angels, primarily interested in early-stage companies, should primarily be
sought among entrepreneurs within new and fast-moving industries such as telecommunications
and electronics. Furthermore, business angel networks trying to attract early-stage investors
should have a local perspective rather than a national perspective in order to enable investors to
take an active part in the management of portfolio companies.
