Abstract People who start new businesses vary in the degree of entrepreneurial talent and
temperament they possess. The same is true of strategic leaders and intrapreneurs inside large
organisations, where entrepreneurial people are required to champion the change agenda in
dynamic and turbulent environments. These issues can be explored in the context of six key
entrepreneur character themes, or natural and instinctive behaviours. Techniques help, but alone
they cannot compensate for missing characteristics. Without the important entrepreneur
characteristics, survival and growth rates are lower. This paper outlines a new framework for
identifying entrepreneurs and describes the research programme through which the model has
been validated.

In today's world of change and uncertainty we need the talents of
entrepreneurs more than ever. We need them to start new businesses; we need
them to champion the change agenda in established corporations and the
public sector. The difficulty is that we only know them when they appear. To
date, we have no effective method for identifying potential entrepreneurs, those
people we should ensure we support, although much work has been done over
the years to link personality characteristics with the way people behave.
Myers-Briggs, for example, using the work of the psychologist Jung, have
defined 16 personality types. While this helps to explain behaviour, it does not
help us to know in which jobs or roles people will perform best. Various
researchers ± see, for example Roberts (1991) and Goldsmith and Wharton
1993) ± have suggested the entrepreneur may be one of three different
personality types. The lack of convergence of this approach makes
identification of the entrepreneur difficult. Does this matter?
Some might argue that the most committed people will make it anyway,
regardless of any inhibitors or encouragement. It is also arguable that ``out
there'' are many more entrepreneurs who, given the right conditions and
opportunities, would simply ``come out of the woodwork'' as happened in
Silicon Valley and around Cambridge in the UK. At the same time, many
would-be entrepreneurs who lack the essential characteristics set off down the
route, quite possibly with the help of training courses, relatively soft finance
and other forms of encouragement. Without the appropriate support, typically

from people who themselves have entrepreneur characteristics, the results will
be disappointing. Arguably it does matter.
Similarly, the environment for established organisations in all sectors
continues to be dynamic, turbulent and uncertain. For many profit-seeking
businesses competition becomes ever-more global in nature. These companies
need to be both reactive and proactive with change initiatives. Continuous,
emergent change is a must; periodically more transformational change will be
required. All of this needs entrepreneurship within the organisation. Sometimes
we will see an entrepreneurial strategic leader as the visible champion of
change. On other occasions the strategic leader will ensure the organisation is
able to recognise, encourage and reward those entrepreneurial employees who
can make a difference.
The purpose of this paper is to explain the background to the development
of the Bolton Thompson Entrepreneur Indicator ± the BTEI ± which we believe
does provide an effective means for identifying those people who are most
likely to succeed as entrepreneurs, regardless of the context. The aim of the
BTEI is to provide a practical and accurate assessment of a person's
entrepreneurial potential and thereby ensure that help and support is given to
those who will benefit the most. The BTEI has a sound research base and
initial testing shows it does work. We believe that it could double the success
rate of business start-ups from the present figure of 20 per cent after five years
to around 40 per cent. At the same time, the identification and support of
potential intrapreneurs could strengthen the competitiveness of businesses in
general.
As a prelude to this discussion it is important to provide a definition for the
entrepreneur we are seeking to identify.
Defining the entrepreneur ± I
Bolton and Thompson (2000) have defined an entrepreneur as ``a person who
habitually creates and innovates to build something of recognised value around
perceived opportunities''. They acknowledge the ``person'' may in fact be an
entrepreneur team, but one with an entrepreneurial champion at its heart. The
use of the word ``habitually'' implies serial behaviour, the pursuit of more than
one opportunity sequentially. Clearly some entrepreneurs still chase
opportunities long after they have reached a position where they could retire
and lead a so-called life of luxury. They simply can not stop themselves.
Finding and seizing opportunities is, for them, natural and instinctive
behaviour.
The recognised value can be economic, social or aesthetic capital. There is
nothing to say that entrepreneurial behaviour is confined to the general world
of the small and growing business. As we have said, entrepreneurs can be
found inside large corporations in both the private and public sectors,
championing change and making a difference. Social entrepreneurs similarly
have a marked impact on communities and community welfare ± sometimes
through profit-seeking social enterprises, ``double bottom-line'' businesses with

<-----Page 2----->a social ethos; sometimes through grant-dependent community initiatives. The facets of the

entrepreneur
architecture. They might see themselves, first and foremost, as artists,
designers, composers or architects but they create or build something that
makes a difference in people's lives and quite frequently they become wealthy
in the process, much as happens with the business entrepreneur. In their own
245
fields they are entrepreneurs because they make a difference in some
significant way.
A clear distinction is being made between the enterprising person and the
entrepreneur. It is arguable that every one of us could, and perhaps should, be
more creative and innovative in many things that we do. The impact, however
valuable, might well be limited in scope. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand,
build something much more substantial that, typically, is significantly
different. In making this distinction the key issue is that not everyone can be an
entrepreneur, and people should not be encouraged to believe that they can.
This is quite different from arguing that everyone should be encouraged to
seek to improve at everything they do and invited to try to clarify in which area
of life they have the greatest opportunity to excel. It may not be as an
entrepreneur.
A further distinction might be made between the entrepreneur and the leader
entrepreneur. Some entrepreneurs who start successful businesses are doing so
because they crave a degree of independence and freedom ± they are somewhat
uncomfortable in ``structured'' organisations with formal systems and
discipline. But as their entrepreneurial businesses grow they need some formal
management systems if they are to cope with the increasing complexity. Some
entrepreneurs can deal with these changes and accept their role is emerging
and changing; they are ``leader entrepreneurs'' who possess a number of
important leader characteristics to complement their entrepreneurial ability.
Others are better served if they sell the business and start something new.
In just the same way we can distinguish three types of corporate
entrepreneur. Some strategic leaders are ``transformers''. They may be
transformers of the industry in which they compete ± these are the people who
successfully ``change the rules'' and cause every rival to take note. Others
transform their individual company, sometimes by changing strategies,
structure and style simultaneously, and often, in the process, turning around a
company's fortune. We might call them ``entrepreneurial leaders'' ± like ``leader
entrepreneurs'' they combine the characteristics of the entrepreneur and the
leader.
The term ``venturers'' embraces those entrepreneurial managers who spin
businesses out of existing businesses, sometimes in the form of management
buy-outs. The history of Silicon Valley is littered with stories of successful
venturers.
Paralleling the notion of the enterprising person (as distinct from the
entrepreneur) is the intrapreneur. Intrapreneurs are those employees who are
able to champion new initiatives in established organisations and make some

<-----Page 3----->MD

246

material difference. They come up with new and valuable ideas which they are
able to resource and develop in an encouraging, enabling culture.
Having defined the entrepreneur, how might we profile and identify one?
Talent, temperament, technique
Our talents are certain important characteristics or innate abilities that we are
born with, but which have to be discovered ± the nature side of the naturenurture debate. They are areas in which we have the greatest potential to excel,
but they have to be developed effectively if this is to happen.
Our temperament is the driving force behind our behaviour. It reflects our
passions, the things that really matter to us. It encapsulates our needs and
wants; and it is our temperament that affects the extent to which we exploit our
talents ± and also appreciate the relative value of certain training and
techniques. Whybrow (1999) and Buckingham and Coffman (1999) describe
temperament respectively in terms of an ``emotional landscape'' and ``highways
through the brain'' that are formed as we grow up and learn from our
environment and experiences, but which relate back to a genetic template.
Temperament thus has both born and made elements. It is, of course, the
nurture case that recognises that our temperament, and to a lesser extent our
talents, can certainly be influenced by the environment in which people grow
and develop.
The acknowledgement of talent and temperament emphasises the weakness
of concentrating on technique-based training for entrepreneurs, especially if it
is being claimed that entrepreneurs can simply be made with the right
education and training. Though business and other techniques may provide
helpful tools and impart knowledge, unless the talent and temperament is there
in the first place a person will not be a successful entrepreneur. The ability to
write a good business plan might be invaluable for the entrepreneur but this
ability will never define the entrepreneur. Techniques can definitely help
improve our talents; but techniques cannot simply create passion and drive.
Our temperament, then, is really a spearhead that builds on our talents and
utilises techniques to improve performance, but it is something we have to
learn how to manage. If our talents are relatively high but our temperament,
and our desire to achieve, weaker, then we may fail to achieve the hidden
potential that we have. Conversely, if our temperament is substantially greater
than our talent we may deceive ourselves into believing we can be better than
we really can.
Character themes
Character themes refer to those behaviours that are the most natural,
instinctive and habitual to us. They are the things we do without thinking.
They can, and generally will, be supported by the right techniques because
when the appropriate training is available the learning is relatively quick and
easy.

entrepreneur
Building on earlier work by the Gallup Organisation, Bolton and Thompson
(2000) identified a list of key entrepreneur characteristics, which they later
refined (2003). In part these were informed by observations of successful
entrepreneurs over many years, by reading and listening to how entrepreneurs
247
explain what they have done and achieved. These are listed and explained
below. Some of these behavioural characteristics will be very visible, maybe
``unsuppressible'', in entrepreneurs. Others will also be natural behaviours,
although not quite as instinctive. The remainder will be achievable with some
effort. All the themes identified can be classified as either talent or
temperament, and some can be strengthened by appropriate techniques.
When reading the list it will be apparent that most of us exhibit these
character themes at some time and to some extent. That is not the significant
issue. What matters is:
.
whether we exhibit these characteristics naturally, serially and
consistently;
.
whether the themes are present to a high, strong level; and
.
how many non-entrepreneur characteristics are more prominent.
Possession of the relevant entrepreneur characteristics implies someone is
``kitted out and ready to go'' ± they have what it takes. With this potential they
may opt for the entrepreneurial route, but they may choose something else
instead. However, at the same time, others without the necessary ``kit'' will be
tempted to become an entrepreneur ± and there are implications when this
happens. If they are a member of an entrepreneur team, where the team
possesses all the entrepreneur characteristics, things could work out very well.
It is when they set off alone the difficulties are likely to arise.
Entrepreneur enablers
A whole variety of different people, from family and friends to financiers, from
professional advisers to trainers and mentors, offer and provide advice and
support to the entrepreneur. Sometimes this advice might be poor; on other
occasions it will be excellent. The willingness of the entrepreneur to seek help
and advice in the first place ± and to discern who might be useful and who
might not ± comes down to certain ``team'' characteristics. The willingness to
listen to the advice will be strongly influenced by the relationship between the
entrepreneur and the adviser and whether there is a ``meeting of minds''. All too
often the person in the enabling role fails to think like the entrepreneur and, as a
result, is met with scepticism.
The effective enabler, then, helps to spot and develop people with talent,
helps the entrepreneur manage his (or her) temperament and imparts useful
techniques. The ideal people to help entrepreneurs are those advisers who
share some of the entrepreneur characteristics, but who are typically missing

<-----Page 5----->MD
42,2

other key ones. In place of the missing entrepreneur characteristics, effective
enablers are frequently strong on ``developer'', an ability to spot potential and a
desire to help bring out the best in others.
Adapting the equation for The Theory of Relativity we might summarise
these themes as follows:

248

C  ME2 ;
where:
C = credibility, the enabler's overall effectiveness;
M = motivation ± a key element of the enabler's ego;
E1 = excellence, the ability to carry out the mentoring and coaching tasks; and
E2 = empathy, which comes from the ``developer'' characteristic.
Defining the entrepreneur ± II
Bolton and Thompson (2003) offer a new framework for defining the
entrepreneur, based on six character themes that conveniently form the
acronym FACETS ± namely:
Focus
Advantage
Creativity
Ego ± inner and outer
Team
Social.
Each of these themes has at least three sub-characteristics. For example, focus
embraces target focus, time focus and action focus, which is often manifested
as urgency by the entrepreneur, a real desire to get on with things.
Creativity, advantage and focus work together. Creativity is the source of
ideas and opportunities. Advantage, the strategic element, distinguishes where
value can be created and added and selects those opportunities that are worth
pursuing. Focus delivers the required outcomes; it is required for effective
implementation.
Ego, meanwhile, has six components, split into our inner ego and our outer
ego. The inner ego embraces motivation (typically a desire to achieve, to make
a difference and maybe to ``leave footprints''), self-assurance and dedication.
The outer ego is the entrepreneur's internal locus of control, a desire to be in
charge of his or her own destiny. It includes responsibility and accountability
and, especially significant, ``courage'' ± an ability and willingness to deal with
setbacks.
FAC, focus, advantage and creativity, are linked talents. E, ego, is
temperament. It dictates how efficiently and effectively the talents are
exploited.
T, team, is a multiplier facet that helps the entrepreneur exploit the FAC
characteristics and extend the business. It is important to flag that there are
several team characteristics that are not entrepreneur team characteristics. In

<-----Page 6----->the context of entrepreneur team characteristics we are looking for four The facets of the
elements:
entrepreneur
(1) Finding (and selecting) the right people ± with complementary FACETS
being arguably more important than parallel functional abilities, such as
marketing, finance and operations.
(2) Building these people into an effective entrepreneur team.
(3) Knowing when and where help is required and who to turn to ± the
selection of appropriate enablers to build an ``external team'', and, vitally
important.
(4) Networking ± with people who can be of value to the entrepreneur and
the business.
Other team characteristics can mean someone is an excellent team member,
who enjoys working with others and makes an influential contribution ± but
the team may not be entrepreneurial in its behaviour.
S, social, influences the nature of the business or initiative, affecting, for
example, whether it is profit-seeking or non-profit and the extent to which it
has a community or environmental outlook. It also affects the culture and style
of the organisation and the way employees are treated. To what extent does the
entrepreneur feel all his or her employees should share the success of the
organisation, for example?
The entrepreneur ``crystal'', like quartz, has a hexagonal structure. Also like
quartz it comes in a variety of shades from the sparkling crystal to the roughcut gemstone. Some entrepreneurs never reach the limelight; others become
household names. But whatever their notoriety they are all essentially the
same. They possess some combination of the six facets of the entrepreneur.
Inter-dependent FACETS
The six FACETS are inter-dependent; and the interlinks between them explain
the important themes of opportunity and risk, which are at the heart of
entrepreneurship.
As we need to distinguish between the inner and the outer ego, and because,
as we have said, entrepreneurial behaviour is serial and habitual, we might
describe these links as ``the seven habits of the effective entrepreneur''!
The process begins with our inner ego, our inner drive, our motivation to do
something.
Creativity and advantage next work together, a binary requirement to
deliver opportunity continuously. Creativity spots opportunities; advantage
selects ones worth pursuing. Ideas, after all, are not necessarily opportunities.
The relevant opportunities might be new products, new services or new
processes, opportunities for operating a business differently.
Focus then combines with our outer ego to make things happen. The
opportunity is engaged and taken forward. The entrepreneur binds

249

<-----Page 7----->MD

250

perseverance and courage to overcome the inevitable setbacks, which confront
him on his (or her) journey. The potential in the opportunity is realised.
It is rare that an entrepreneur would be able to build something of
consequential value entirely alone. Hence team is used to drive multiplier
effects. Things start to spin off from each other as the venture gathers
momentum. Entrepreneurs do what they do because they are passionate about
something ± reflected in their inner ego. Many surround themselves with
equally passionate people.
The social facet may or may not be brought into play. Where social is
significant it impacts on the direction of the business or initiative by affecting
motivation (the inner ego that we start with), which in turn opens up new and
different opportunities and selection priorities (advantage), a different focus
and the courage to do something different that has social or maybe
environmental outcomes. Where social is strong it will attract a distinctive type
of team member or follower.
The additional characteristics of the leader
Focus is just as important for the leader as it is for the entrepreneur. However,
creativity and advantage are not defining characteristics of the leader. Instead,
leaders need ``strategic visioning'' ± while they may not necessarily be
described as visionaries, they have to be able to clarify the future direction of
the organisation, thinking long-term in the process. In contrast, advantage is
more short-term in nature. This vision then has to be communicated; others
have to be persuaded to commit and follow. Two relevant characteristics here
are ``envisioning'' and ``influencing''. Working alongside these are two
additional team characteristics ± gathering followers and empowering others.
As with the entrepreneur ego is also critical ± the leader, again, must want to
make a difference. Similarly, the presence ± or absence ± of the social
characteristic will have a marked influence on both the direction and culture of
the organisation.
The Bolton Thompson entrepreneur indicator
It is quite feasible that a person who studies the type of observable behaviour
associated with each of the FACETS can make a sound self-assessment of the
strength of each of their FACETS. However, Bolton and Thompson have
developed and tested different questionnaires, which allow an external
judgement to be made. The evolving research programme is explained below;
and the emerging outcome is a new entrepreneur indicator.
Ideally the BTEI is a three-screen process, the questionnaire comprising the
first stage. The balanced questionnaire that provides a first assessment of a
person's FACETS strengths has evolved from other questionnaires that have
been tested in various environments. With this the raw scores are perceived to
be less important than the underlying patterns. The key issues are as follows:

The relative strength of the team characteristics, because of the impact
this has on growth potential.

The second screen stage is a self-assessment procedure conducted within a
workshop programme run by trained evaluators. Here a detailed description of
each of the FACETS is presented to the participants and on the basis of this
deeper understanding they make their own assessment before agreeing a final
evaluation with a trained evaluator.
The third screening is an ongoing evaluation set within a mentor programme
that takes the potential entrepreneur/intrapreneur from start-up to growing
business or developed project over a two to three year programme. Formal
FACET evaluations are made during this period to monitor changes. Where real
talent is present we can expect to see improvements in the character themes.
Validating the framework and developing the questionnaire
The Huddersfield Business Generator (HBG)
The Huddersfield Business Generator was set up to help embryo creative
businesses at the start-up stage. It might be described as a pre-incubator as
most of the businesses involved are, at best, only just beginning to trade when
they join. There is a mixture of resident and virtual tenants.
In 2000, a sample of 14 tenants agreed to be interviewed face-to-face. A
questionnaire was designed, using as its foundation questions previously
created and tested by Gallup. A total of 12 character themes were included,
with three questions for each one. Respondents were simply asked the
questions by the interviewer; prompting and elaboration did not take place.
The interviewer was looking for a particular type of response in every case, the
response an entrepreneur would provide that is consistent with the definition
provided earlier. These sought-for responses were derived from focus groups
and other observations of the behaviour of successful entrepreneurs.
Afterwards, and prior to any feedback, each respondent was provided with a
list of the characteristics in the questionnaire and asked to judge his or her own
strengths and weaknesses. There was no detailed explanation of the
implications of the characteristics.
When we took the percentage of ``entrepreneur answers'' to the questions we
came up with the following results:
.
creativity ± 83 per cent;
.
ego ± 76 per cent;
.
focus ± 69 per cent;

<-----Page 9----->MD
42,2

252

.
.

advantage ± 61 per cent; and
team ± 50 per cent.

Given the businesses operate in the creative industries it is, of course,
hardly surprising that creativity tops the list. Interestingly, the creativityadvantage-focus funnel has a narrow middle, indicating a weaker ability to
appreciate the strategic and competitive advantage issues linked to ideas. The
FAC (talents) average is 71 per cent, lower than the key temperament, ego,
score of 76 per cent.
When we compared the questionnaire responses to the interviewees' selfperceptions there was a strong correlation between creativity and ego.
However, there was a lower correlation between focus and team. The
respondents tended to think they were lower on focus but significantly higher
on team. It was the belief of the interviewing team that the interviewees
interpreted team behaviour from a very wide perspective; they did not fully
appreciate the specific team characteristics associated with the entrepreneur.
As highlighted earlier, they were provided with only a limited explanation.
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
GEM is an annual research programme which tracks start-up activity in some
40 countries worldwide. It does not set out to analyse the characteristics of the
people involved in the start-up activity, per se.
In the New Zealand GEM in 2002 a total of 2,836 respondents, selected at
random, were contacted by telephone to check whether they were actively
engaged in starting a business or planning to do so. As an adjunct to the actual
GEM work, 242 of those who responded positively agreed to answer a follow
telephone questionnaire. This was a different questionnaire to the one used in
the HBG. It comprised 20 statements, which relate to selected characteristics
associated with the entrepreneur, the leader and with someone we might call
non-entrepreneurial. Respondents were asked to give themselves a score out of
ten to reflect the extent to which the statement applied to them. The actual
scores were seen as relatively unimportant; we were looking for the relative
placement or ranking of the characteristics.
Opportunity taking emerged as the leading characteristic, regardless of
whether those concerned were categorised as opportunity entrepreneurs
(people who had spotted an opportunity and were minded to do something
about it) or necessity entrepreneurs (those for whom the self-employment or
start-up route was perceived to be their best economic option at the time,
perhaps because they had been made redundant).
The lowest was the motivation to make a significant difference element of
ego, although courage fared better!
The rank order was:
(1) advantage;
(2) creativity;

<-----Page 10----->(3) focus;
(4) team; and
(5) ego.
This time, the FAC talent scores were higher than the temperament score. As
had been the case with the HBG questionnaire, social was excluded as we were
not targeting social entrepreneurs.
A number of non-entrepreneur team characteristics were included in the
questionnaire and the relative ranking of these was high, higher than the
entrepreneur team characteristics.
Did these results make sense for New Zealand?
Although New Zealand consistently demonstrates relatively high start-up
activity among the GEM countries, much higher, for example, than most
European countries, the relative growth rate of these businesses is not high.
They are enterprising small businesses rather than high-growth
entrepreneurial firms, although these latter do exist in more limited numbers.
Moreover, the failure rate of new start-ups is relatively high in the global
context. As this is not ego outstripping talent, it is perhaps, and at least in part,
explained by the low strength of the team facet.
The low ego itself is quite possibly linked to what the New Zealanders call
``the tall poppy syndrome'', a delight in bringing successful individuals down to
earth, rather than treating them as heroes. New Zealand is more committed to
team success, as seen with the All Blacks and Team New Zealand. There is also
a commitment to the recreational lifestyle that the country offers, thereby
creating a general lack of urgency to grow.
For a fuller explanation of this research see Frederick et al. (2002).
A third questionnaire, this time a paired comparison test which contrasts 16
entrepreneur characteristics with 16 non-entrepreneurial characteristics, was
later administered to eight part-time, mature students on a Masters degree in
business innovation and entrepreneurship in Auckland. The results were
different. This time the ego score was much higher ± as one might expect
from self-selected students with ambitions for high growth. The ego
score was higher than the scores for focus, advantage and creativity. As
was the case with the Huddersfield Business Generator sample,
creativity > focus > advantage.
This particular sample of students had also had the opportunity to analyse
themselves against the FACETS framework, having had it explained to them
in some detail. It is apparent that when respondents look into the implications
of the relative significance of each theme cluster, it helps explain why they
behave in particular ways and points the way to the appropriate support from
which they might benefit.
The Gallup StrengthsFinder Instrument
The Gallup StrengthsFinder Instrument is an on-line paired comparison
questionnaire that identifies a person's five most natural behavioural

characteristics or potential strengths. It is explained in detail in Buckingham
and Clifton (2001). The five are selected from a list of 34, which itself has been
distilled from some 400 discrete themes identified by Gallup over 30 years.
A sample of 71 ``entrepreneurs'' and entrepreneur enablers identified by
Bolton and Thompson was given access to the instrument and the results
analysed. The sample comprised enterprising people and entrepreneurs in the
context of the earlier definition ± people were not selected on the grounds they
had either grown a significant venture or exhibited serial behaviour.
Of the 34 Gallup themes, 19 identify or relate directly to the FACETS
themes:
.

two identify with focus;

.

three identify with advantage;

.

one identifies with creativity;

.

six identify with ego;

.

five identify with entrepreneur team characteristics; and

.

two identify with social.

Adopting a crude measure, as each of 71 respondents produces five key themes
out of 34 possibilities ± a total of 355 ± we might expect each theme to be cited
10.5 times in this sample. Thus, 11 citations and above would represent an
above-average incidence. The actual citation record was as follows (Table I).
In summary, the ranking of the significance of the FACETS clusters is as
follows:
(1) creativity;
(2) advantage;
(3) focus;
(4) team;
(5) ego; and
(6) social.

temperament strength below the talents strength.
Business Link South Yorkshire
The first FACETS balanced questionnaire was developed from the learning
experiences with the HBG, GEM and Gallup. This comprised 16 paired
comparison questions related to the four FACE characteristics ± focus,
advantage, creativity and inner and outer ego. The first version was piloted in
New Zealand with a small sample of Masters students; a refined version was
tested in summer 2003.
In 2003 Business Link South Yorkshire offered a free, concentrated summer
school opportunity for recent graduates who had an idea for a business start up
and who were selected from advertisements in local papers. As part of the
selection process each applicant filled in a FACE questionnaire. Some 46
responses were evaluated, with the results set out in Table II. The scoring used
allowed people to receive a maximum of +20 and a minimum of ±20 for each
characteristic. A score of +20 indicates a strong presence of the character
theme; a ±20 indicates strength in the paired characteristic. These pairs are all
respectable characteristics; they are simply not those pertaining to the
entrepreneur.
We can see quite clearly that the temperament scores are greater than the
talent scores, and that of the talents, creativity exceeds both advantage and
focus. Focus is the only characteristic where a minus average score was
recorded. What does this seem to be telling us? The people who responded to
the advertisement were ideas people who were ``up for the challenge''. This was
not a surprise; these are the type of people who might be expected to respond to
such an advertisement. However, because the temperament score exceeds the
talents score, and because outer ego (courage) is higher than inner ego, there is
a real danger the people in question could be tempted to believe they can
achieve more than they will ± unless the help and support they receive is
carefully targeted and deals with certain key issues. The inner ego is the
confidence and will to do something and to exercise one's talents; it is about
motivation and the drive to take action. The outer ego, built around courage,
handles the consequences.

Specifically, these results were telling us that if the paticipants were to benefit
from the summer school, the concentration of effort should be targeted on
addressing advantage and focus. It is vital the students come to appreciate the
need for creating and adding value (advantage and opportunity) and
implementation (focus).

Commentary
The research conducted at the Huddersfield Business Generator and with GEM
and Gallup validated the FACETS framework. From this the balanced
questionnaire piloted in New Zealand and with Business Link South Yorkshire
was developed; and this latter evaluation indicated the format the summer
school should take. In the event, the results did guide the selection of
participants; and the content of the summer school was built around techniques
to support advantage and focus. Participants began to appreciate what would
be required to develop their ideas into a true opportunity and possibly a serious
business. It would have been very easy and tempting to concentrate instead on
exercises in creativity and motivation ± whilst this would have been enjoyable
to the participants (who have clear strengths in these characteristics) it would
not have addressed their real needs.
The first challenge with identifying potential entrepreneurs is one of
recognition and visibility. It is, therefore, seen as desirable that the first
screening questionnaire is widely available via the Web to allow as many
people as possible to use it and evaluate themselves. This screening can be
used to reduce the many to the possible. But, ideally, it is just a starting point.
There is always the danger people will see the analysis as an interesting
exercise ± as they do many other profiling opportunities ± and not take the
implications seriously. The second screening ± involving the fuller explanation
and workshop ± will help convert the possible to the probable; and the third
screening ± with a programme of mentoring ± will transform the probable into
more actual success stories.
When we look at entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs who are
determined to succeed ± as distinct from less ambitious, but nevertheless
enterprising, people ± we find the relative temperament score becomes stronger
and it is in fact higher than the FAC talents scores. The reverse is the case with
people we might describe as more enterprising as distinct from entrepreneurial.
While this might not be unexpected it does emphasise the significant
importance of the desire to do something, the very start of the entrepreneurship
process. If the desire is there, people can be supported with certain aspects of
talent development, but to what extent can we put desire in place if it is not
already there? However, this still requires effective enabling from someone who
fully appreciates the importance of the ideas outlined in this paper. Not every
business adviser or coach is an effective enabler, as the relationship breakdown
between many would-be entrepreneurs and their would-be advisers confirms.
At an individual level the relative strengths of focus, advantage and
creativity highlights the type of team member a person needs to work with,

<-----Page 14----->always remembering ideas are not opportunities, and opportunities have to be The facets of the
engaged and implemented. Again the effective enabler can help build

entrepreneur teams.
It is, then, interesting to note the relatively low rankings of team amongst
the populations we investigated. To recap, in the context of entrepreneur team
characteristics we are looking for four elements:
257
(1) Finding (and selecting) the right people.
(2) Building these people into an effective entrepreneur team.
(3) Knowing when and where help is required and who to turn to.
(4) Networking.
Many people will have strong team skills or characteristics, such as being
supportive of others and listening attentively, which are different from those
listed above. If the entrepreneur team characteristics are missing, there is a
clear directional message concerning how we need to target support and
assistance.
Some concluding comments
We believe the FACETS framework can provide a valuable new insight to help
entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs understand their own strengths and
potential and, at the same time, flag up the areas where they are going to need
the greatest support if they are to succeed. The themes have been translated
into an entrepreneur indicator to enable interested outsiders to do exactly the
same and thus target their support more effectively. These interested outsiders
can also include the strategic leader and senior managers of larger, established
organisations who need to be able to spot and facilitate those managers with
the greatest potential to be intrapreneurs, entrepreneurs within the company.
But who are these effective enablers for providing effective follow-up
support? Our research has led us to conclude that they are people who can
think and behave ``inside the same box'' as the entrepreneur himself. In other
words, they also possess a number of the entrepreneur character themes ±
although typically one or more will be relatively weak. It is frequently
advantage or ego that is missing to such a degree that the enablers are not
entrepreneurs themselves. However, they also need to possess a desire and an
ability to develop others and to bring out the best in them. While the initial
questionnaire used with Business Link contained 16 questions which relate to
the FACE characteristics, additional questions which embrace team and social
have been developed and tested, as have a number of questions which relate
specifically to the entrepreneur enabler. We can look for the potential to be an
effective enabler at the same time as we look for the potential to be an
entrepreneur. This will allow us to target and strengthen the support process
for entrepreneurs and raise its effectiveness ± which will support our
fundamental aim of increasing the number of entrepreneurs who succeed in
developing sustainable growth businesses.
