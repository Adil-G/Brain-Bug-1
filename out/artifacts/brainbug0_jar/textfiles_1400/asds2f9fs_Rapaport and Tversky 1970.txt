Seven subjects participated in an optional stopping experiment, sampling
sequentially independent and identically distributed offers from a normal
distribution. On each trial a subject could either pay a fixed cost and sample
another offer or stop the search and receive a payoff based on the values of
the offers sampled thus far. The cost per observation, the form of the payoff
function, and the maximum number of offers that could be sampled were
varied. Dependent variables consisted of the number of offers actually sampled, the proportion of optimally solved problems, and the magnitude and
number of errors.
Most of the optional stopping problems were solved optimally. When
discrepancies from the optimal stopping rule occurred, subjects tended to
stop the search when they should have continued. A cut-off point model was
tested and compared to the optimal stopping rule.

optional stopping tasks, then, is to find some stopping rule that maximizes his expected gain.
Many everyday sequential decisions, such as buying or renting a house,
selling a used car, selecting a candidate for a job, or purchasing some
product on the market, can be viewed as optional stopping problems. In
all of these examples, a decision maker searches for the best offer, and
the termination of the search is determined by somehow weighing his
subjective probability of obtaining a better offer against the cost of additional search. This cost may be expressed in units of money, time, or
discomfort. Optional stopping problems, therefore, are of considerable interest from both normative and descriptive viewpoints. The goal of the
normative analysis is to determine optimal stopping r~les, that is, rules
that maximize the expected gain. The goal of the descriptive analysis is to
characterize the behavior of individuals in optional stopping problems.
Both viewpoints will be presented in this paper.
Optional stopping problems may be classified according to various
criteria-knowledge of the distribution function, limits on the maximum
number of offers that can be sampled, form of the payoff fm~ction, and
form of the cost function. Suppose the offers are independent and identically distributed with a common distribution function F ( x ) . This distribution function may be known exactly, or it may be known only partially, or it may be completely unknown. (In the latter case, only the
ran£ of the nth offer relative to the already observed offers is told to the
player. Otherwise, some learning about the distribution function is
inevitable.)
The total number of offers, denoted by N, that can be sampled may be
bounded or unbounded. In the former case it is assumed to be known to
the player from the start.
The payoff function may assume various forms. The two most common
payoff functions which have been studied both mathematically (e.g.,
Chow & Robbins, 1961, 1963; DeGroot, 1968; MacQueen & Miller, 1960)
and experimentally (Rapoport & Tversky, 1966) are:

where ci (i = 1,2,... ,n) denotes the cost per observation on Stage i. Optional stopping problems based on (1) are ealled (DeGroot, 1968) sampling problems without recall since the gross payoff equals the value of
the las~ offer. Once an offer has been passed, it can no longer be recalled.
Similarly, problems based on (2) are called sampling problems with re-

<-----Page 2----->OPTIONAL STOPPING TASK

107

call, since the gross payoff equals the value of the hiqhest offer observed;
any sampled offer can be recalled, so to speak, at any time.
Finally, the cost per observation may be constant, i.e., c~ = c for
n = 1 , . . . ,N, or it may vary as a function of n.
The above distinctions imply a 3 X 2 X 2 X 2 array with 24~ distinct
cases, which cover most of the optional stopping, or stopping rule problems, that have been investigated. (Note that the class of problems discussed in the present paper is distinguished from a b~oader class of sequentia] decision making problems by the characteristic that the gross
payoff depends on the values of the offers observed prior to the stopping
point. In many sequential sampling problems in statistical decision
theory (Wald, 1950), the player can also decide when to stop collecting
observations, but. his gross payoff is not determined by the actual values
of the observations, but rather, by the accuracy of his terminal decision,
which is typically based on the sampled observations.)
Problems of sampling without recall, a bounded N, and an unknown
distribution function have been treated by Breiman (1964), and Gilbert
and Mosteller (1966). Chow and Robbins (1961, 1963), MacQueen and
Miller (1960), and Sakaguchi (196.1) studied stopping rule problems of
sampling with or without recall, where N is either bounded or unbounded
and F(z) is known. Problems of sampling with or without recall, where
the distribution function involves parameters with unknown values, have
been treated by DeGroot (1968), Sakaguchi (1961), and Yahav (1966).
There have been only few experimental investigations of choice behavior in optional stopping problems. Kahan, Rapoport, and Jones (1967)
investigated the ease where the distribution function was unknown, N
was bounded (N = 200) and known, and the payoff function was given
by (1) with c~ = c -----0. The optimal stopping rule for this problem is to
pass the first 74 offers and then stop with the first offer whose value exceeds the values of all the offers sampled up to this time. About 60% of
the subjects who participated in the experiment followed the optimal
stopping rule.
Rapoport and Tversky (1966) conducted a computer-controlled experiment where F (z) was assumed to be known, and N was unbounded. Two
groups of subiects participated in the experiment, Groups L and I-I, who
received the payoff functions (1) and (2), respectively, with c~ = c. Four
different cost conditions were given to each group. The major findings of
this study were that Group H took significantly more offers than Group
L and that the difference between the average number of offers taken by
the two groups decreased as c increased. The optimal stopping rule, however, is the same for both groups regardless of whether sampling is with
or without recall. More specifically, the optimal solution to the above

<-----Page 3----->108

RAPOPORT AND TVERSKY

problem (Chow & Robbins, 1961; MaeQueen & Miller, 1960) is to stop
as soon as one obtains an offer whose value exceeds a(c) , where a(c) is
the unique solution of the equation
(z -

~ ) f ( x ) dx = c,

(a)

where/(x)dz = dF(z).
To obtain the optimal solution the distribution function must be completely known. Since subjects in the study of Rapoport and Tversky
(1966) received no prior information about the distribution function and
only sampled a relatively small number of offers during the entire experinaent, there is some doub~ whether they learned the shape of the distribution function sufficiently well. The purpose of the present study is
to overcome this shortcoming by running subjects who had a great deal
of experience with the distribution of the observations and the sampling
procedure, and to extend the investigation to the ease where the number
of observations is bounded. Specifically, we investigated the behavior of
subjects in an optional stopping task, using several values of c and N,
and comparing the effect~sof sampling with or without recall.
METHOD
Subjects. The subjects were four male and three female first year students in psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who volunteered to participate in a paid decision making experiment.
The subjects met five times a week for seven weeks. Each experimental
session las~ed about two hours. Throughout the first six weeks they partieipated in a signal detection type experiment. The optional stopping
study was conducted during the last week. The reason for employing the
same subjects in both studies was that throughout the first study each
subject observed sequentially 7800 slides of four-digit numbers (offers)
sampled randomly from each of two different distributions, denoted A
and B. Since performance throughout this period depended on knowledge
of the two distributions, and since the number of offers presented to the
subjects was unusually high, it seems reasonable to assume a fair knowledge of the two distributions by the time the present study v~as started.
Design. The experimental design, which ineluded six sessions, is summarized in Table 1. As shown in the table, Sessions 1, 2, 4, and 6 consisted
of sampling without recall, whereas Sessions 3 and 5 consisted of sampling
with recall. Distribution A was employed in Sessions 1, 3, and 4, and distribution B was used in the remaining sessions. N was bounded and known
in all six sessions with N = 24 in Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 5, and N = 8 in
Sessions 4 and 6. Four constant cost conditions (c = 0, 5, 10, 20) were
employed in the study. In each session, an equal number of problems were

presented with each of the (three or four) cost conditions; six problems
for each cost condition were presented in Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 5, and five
problems in Sessions 4 and 6. To minimize the dependency among problems within a given session, the cost conditions were presented in the alternating order 10, 0, 20, 5, 10, etc., except in Sessions 3 and 5 where the
ease c = 0 did not appear.
The two distributions were normal with the same standard deviation
of 167. The means of distributions A and B were 1630 and 1797, respectively. Five-hundred offers were prepared for each distribution so that
the normal distribution was approximated rather closely by the observed
frequency distributions.
Procedure. Subjects were run as a group. The observations were presented by a slide projector in a randomized order. Presentation time was
controlled manually by the experimenter; it varied between 5 and 12
seconds per slide with a mean of 8 seconds.
Subjects received detailed instructions about the task and the payoff
function. The cost condition for each session was specified on a response
sheet and the value of each offer was copied in the appropriate column on
the response sheet. When a subject decided to stop observing more offers,
he was instructed to write either four A's or four B's (depending on the
distribution that was used in the particular session) instead of copying
the offers that appeared on the slides. This was done in order to prevent
tacit communication among subjects. At the end of each problem every
subject computed and recorded his net gain for the problem.
To allow a direct comparison between sampling with or without recall,
the same sequences of offers were presented for cost conditions c = 5,
c ---- 10, and c = 20 in Sessions 1 and 3, and in Sessions 2 and 5. The presentation order of the problems differed between the two sampling conditions, but the order of the offers within a sequence was not changed.
Thus, the subjects actually observed the same sequences of offers when
sampling was with or without recall. A postexperimental interview showed
that no subject was aware of this fact.

<-----Page 5----->110

RAPOPORT AND TVERSK~

Subjects were told that offers in each session and each problem were
sampled randomly from the distribution used in the session. Indeed, they
had no reason to suspect dependence between the offers, particularly after
their six-weeks experience with comparable sequences of independent
identically distributed offers. Subjects were asked to maximize their gain
for each problem, and were paid 20 agorot (approximately a nickel) for
every 1000 points that they had accumulated. The payoff per session for
optimal performance amounted to approximately $2.25 for Sessions 1
and 2, and $1.75 for each of the remaining sessions.
RESULTS

This section is divided into three parts. Presented in the first part are
the results of sampling without recall--Sessions 1, 2, 4, and 6, then results
of sampling with recall--Sessions 3 and 5--are presented in the following
part, and finally the two sampling procedures are compared in the last
part. In each of the first two parts the presentation follows a similar pattern: the optimal policy is derived, the proportion of optimally solved
problems, the number of offers sampled, and the type and magnitude of
errors are presented, and a cut-off point model is tested.
S a m p l i n g w i t h o u t recall. Suppose offers are independent and identically
distributed with a common distribution function F ( x ) , which is completely known. The optimal stopping rule for problems of sampling without recall, when m = N - - n + 1 trials (stages) are left in the problem
and the offer x was observed on the previous trial, is obtained (Sakaguehi,
19'61) according to the following principle:
if x > w m - c, stop sampling;
if x _-< u,~ - c, continue sampling, m = 0,1, . . . ,N - 1.

(4)

If (w~ -- c) < 0 the optimal stopping rule specifies to take no offers at all
and to accept a net gain of zero.
The critical numbers w~ are defined by the recurrence relation:

When c > 0 and N is unbounded, the sequence (w,,} converges to a(c) +
c when m --> =.
Figure 1 portrays the values of w~ against m, m = 1 , 2 , . . . ,24, for four
different values of c, when F ( x ) is the standard normal distribution function. When the four costs, 0, .03, .06, and .12, are multiplied by the standard deviation, 167, they yield the four costs, 0, 5, 10, and 20, used in the
present experiment. The values of the critical numbers w= can be used to
obtain the critical numbers vm for distribution A (v,, = 167w~ + 1630),
and distribution B (v~ = 167w~, + 1797), since the critical numbers for
a normal distribution with mean ,~, and variance ~2 are given by v~, =
~w~ + ~.. I t is noted t h a t since the critical numbers v~ are increasing in

critical number minus the corresponding cost for this stage but stopping
at a later stage with an offer with a lower value. This behavior is, clearly,

Proportion o] optimally solved problems. Each subject solved altogether
88 different problems of sampling without recall, 48 problems in the high
N condition (Sessions 1 and 2), and 40 problems in the low N condition
(Sessions 4 and 6). A problem is said to be solved optimally when the
optimal stopping rule (4) is strictly adhered to. Since there were no significant differences in the mean proportion of optimally solved problems
between distributions A and B for each of the N conditions, the results
of the two distributions were combined.
The first two columns of Table 2 show the proportion of optimally
solved problems for each subject under each N condition. The table shows
that the mean proportion is higher for N----8 (.711) than for N---= 24
(.652), and further suggests that individual differences are consistent
over the two N conditions. Indeed, the results of both a correlated t test
between the mean proportions It(6) ------2.07], and a product-moment
correlation between the two N conditions (r ---- .70) , approached statistical significance at the .05 level.
Number of offers taken. Let n* (c) denote the optimal number of offers
that ought to be taken in a problem where offers are presented sequentially. The values of n* (e), determined by the optimal stopping rule (4),
were computed for the 48 problems in the high N condition. The means
and standard deviations of n* (c), ~* (c), and SD [n* (c) ], respectively, are
presented in the last two rows of the left-hand side of Table 3. Note that
the expected inequality n* (c) > n* (c') whenever c' > c, was not always
satisfied in the particular set of problems used in the experiment.
Let n (c) denote the mean number of offers taken by each subject under
each cost condition in Sessions 1 and 2 (each mean is based on 12 values).
The left-hand side of Table 3 shows the 28 values of n(c) together with

<-----Page 8----->113

OPTIONAL STOPPING TASK

their means, ~ (c). Comparison of the distributions of observed and optimal number of offers shows that subjects took on the average fewer offers
than predicted. Thus, n (c) < ~:" (c) for 26 out of 28 cases (p < .05 according to a sign test). To obtain further information regarding the number and magnitude of discrepancies from the optimal model the following
analysis of errors was performed.
Analysis o] errors. A subject could violate the optimal stopping rule
(4) in one of two ways. He could make a Type I error by passing over
an offer when he should have stopped, or he could make a Type II error
by stopping when he should have continued sampling. On each problem
a subject could make more than one Type I error bnt only one Type II
error (on the last trial). Table 2 'shows that errors were made in about
½ of the problems. To investigate the magnitude of errors, let e = [z~ -(v,, -- c) 1/167 denote the (absolute) magnitude of a given error, expressed
in standard deviation units, and let g denote the mean magnitude of
errors of a certain type for a given subject. Since no systematic differences
due to costs were observed in the number and magnitude of errors, the
number of errors was summed across the four cost conditions. Table 4
presents the total number of errors, denoted t, of a given type, as well as
the values of g for each of the subjects. The results are presented separately for the two N conditions.
Inspection of Table 4 shows that g is smaller than one-fourth of a
standard deviation in all but one case (Subject 5, N = 8, Type II). No
significant differences between the subjects were observed although Subjeer 4 tended to perform worse than the other subjects, while Subjects 1
and 3 tended to perform slightly better than the remaining subj cots. The

magnitude of T y p e I I errors appears to be considerably larger than that
of T y p e I ; it is about twice as large in the high N condition and about six
times as large in the low N condition. Likewise, the number of T y p e II
errors exceeded the number of T y p e I errors for all but one subject (Subjeer 4, N = 24). The excess of T y p e II errors is particularly noticeable in
the low N eondiUon.
A cut-off point model. Since subjects did not know and could not possibly use rule (4) for determining the stopping point and since a high
proportion of their responses were optimal, different, perhaps simpler
models than the optimal stopping rule may lead to the same or even
better predictions. A model suggested by K a h a n et al. (1967) prescribes to
sample n < N offers to gain some knowledge of the distribution and then
take the first, offer that exceeds M standard deviations above the mean
of the previous offers. Since this model requires the estimation of two
parameters (n and M) and since it is rather difficult to test it here because
of the relatively small values of N, an alternative model has been proposed. According to the strong version of this model, a subject selects a
cut-off point for every N and every cost condition and stops the search
on a given problem with the first offer whose value exceeds the predetermined cut-off point. If no such value is observed, sampling is continued
to the last stage. According to the weak version of the model, the cut-off
point is selected at the beginning of each problem and the cut-off point is
allowed to v a r y from one problem to another within a given cost condition. The weak cut-off point model is v e r y general and much more difficult
to refute than the strong cut-off point mode1, particularly when n ~ (c) is
relatively small.

<-----Page 10----->OPTIONAL STOPPING TASK

115

The two versions of the cut-off point model are elearly nonoptimal
when sampling is without recall and N is bounded and known. They may
provide, however, a good first approximation in an early stage of the
problem, particularly when N = 24, and c is relatively large. The quality
of such an approximation can be evaluated by examining Figure 1.
The weak cut-off point model is violated if a subject stops the search
after sampling n offers (1 < n < N) where there exists an z~ such that
x~ > x~ when n > k. Analysis of the subjects' stopping points in the high
N condition showed thai/the model was violated at least once by every
subject. The total number of problems summed over subjects in which the
model was violated was 25 out of the 291 problems on which the model
was tested (8.59%). The smallest number of violations was 1 for Subject.
1 and the largest was 6 for Subject 3.
The test of the strong cut-off point model was based on computing a
range of numbers containing the unknown value of the cut-off point and
then counting the highest number Of ranges for a given cost condition
whose intersection was nonempty. Only problems in the high N condition
for which 1 < n < N were included in the analysis. The test was condueted in the following way. First, a value of 167 was subtracted from the
value of every offer sampled in Session 2 to allow direct comparison between distributions A and B. Then a range (y,x) was determined for
every problem and every subject, where x denotes the value of the last
offer taken, and y denotes the value of the largest among the preceding
offers on the same problem. Clearly, x > y for problems that do not
violate the weak cut-off point model, but y _> z for the remaining problems and hence the range (y,x) is empty in these eases. If a cut-off point
exists it should fall within the range (y,x).
After determining in this manner the ranges (some of which were
empty) for each subieet under each cost condition, the highest number
of ranges yielding a nonempty intersection was counted. We denote this
number by r(c), and the lower and upper bounds of the resulting nonempty intersection by bl(c) and b2(e), respectively. Finally, the r(c)
values were summed over the four cost conditions for each subiect and
divided by the total number of problems for which N > n > 1 (between
40 to 44 problems for each subieet). The resulting proportions of problems
whose solutions were compatible with the strong cut-off point model are
shown on the third column of Table 2.
A comparison between Columns 1 and 3 of Table 2 shows that the proportion of problems supporting the strong cut-off point model is somewhat
larger than the proportion of the optimally solved problems for six out of
seven subieets. Note, however, that the strong cut-off point model is considerably weaker than the optimal model since the latter makes point

predictions for the critical numbers v~, whereas the former determines
only lower and upper bounds for the cut-off point. Furthermore, the
resulting ranges are not of the Same size and m a y frequently be fairly
large. The mean values of the ranges computed over subjects for each cost
condition were 9.6, 12.1, 21.0, and 26.4 for c--=-0, c = 5, c ~ 10, and
c ~ 20, respectively.
Sampling with recall. The optimal stopping rule in problems of sampling with recall, when c ~ 0 and the offer x~ was observed at the previous
trial, is obtained according to the following, principle (Chow & Robbins,
1963) :
if x~ > a(c), stop sampling,
if x~-< a (c), continue sampling,

(8)

for n ---- 1,2, . . . ,N - - 1. Clearly, if ~(c) < 0 one should take no offers at
all and accept a net gain of zero.
The critical number a (c) is the unique solution of (3). I t is independent
of N even when N is bounded and known. When F(x) is the standard
normal distribution function the values of the critical numbers are:
a ( . 0 3 ) - - 1 . 4 9 0 , ~ ( . 0 6 ) = 1.167, and ,a(.12:)= .799. Multiplying these
values by 167 and adding the result to the mean of distribution A or B
yields the critical numbers: , a ( 5 ) = 1879, . a ( 1 0 ) = 1825, and a ( 2 0 ) - 1763 for distribution A, and ,a(5) = 2046, ~(10) = 1992, and a(20) --1930 for distribution B.
The stopping rule (8) was used to determine the optimal number of
offers, n*(c), for every problem under the three cost conditions. The
values of n* (c) and SD [n* (c) ] are presented on the last two rows of the
right-hand side of T a b l e 3. The table also shows t h e values of n ( c ) - - t h e
mean number of offers taken by each subieet under each of the three cost
conditions in Sessions 3 and 5.
Inspection of the right-hand side of Table 3 shows t h a t most subiects
took, on the average, fewer offers than predicted by the optimalmodel.
(This tendency to take fewer offers is weaker than the one obtained under
sampling without recall. There were 6 (out of 21) cases in sampling with
recall for which n(c) > ~* (c) compared with only two (out of 28) cases
in sampling without recall.)
The analysis of errors is based on the frequency and magnitude of T y p e
I and T y p e I I errors. T y p e I error is defined, as before, as a case where
a subiect passes an offer when he should stop. Obviously, a subject can
make more than one T y p e I error on a certain problem. The definition of
T y p e I I error differs, however, from the one given for sampling without
recall. A subiect is said to make a T y p e I I error if he stops observing on
the nth trial and max(x~,x2, . . . ,x~) < , ~ ( c ) . In sampling with recall, a

<-----Page 12----->OPTIONAL STOPPING TASK

]]7

subject can make either one or more T y p e I errors or just one Type I I
error on a certain problem. H e cannot make both types of error on the
same problem.
The proportions of optimally solved problems are presented on the last
column of Table 2. Table 5 shows the total number of errors, t, of each
type and the mean values of e for each subject. The table shows that the
errors are of about the same magnitude as those observed in sampling
without recall. Excluding Subject 4, who contributed more than one-half
of all T y p e I errors, it is seen that the number of T y p e I I errors is twice
as large as the number of T y p e I errors. Individual differences in the
number and magnitude of errors are also similar to the ones observed in
Table 4, with Subject 4 having more errors with larger magnitudes than
the rest of the subjects. Subjects 5, 6, and 7, the three female subjects,
made considerably more T y p e I I than T y p e I errors, while Type I errors
were more frequent than T y p e I I errors for Subjects 1 and 4.
The optimal stopping rule (8) is clearly a special case of the (weak or
strong) cUt-off point model, where the cut-off point is uniquely specified.
Support for the former model implies support for the latter model, but
not conversely. Thus, a subject could make a T y p e I I error without
violating the cut-off point model, if his actual cut-off point happened to
be lower than ~ (c). Similarly, if the search is terminated on the Nth trial
and the subject's actual cut-off point is higher than a(c), a T y p e I error
does not necessarily violate the cut-off point model.
The weak cut-off point model was tested as before only for those
problems for which the search terminated on the nth trial, 1 ( n ~ N.
The model was violated in 44 out of the 217 problems on which it was
tested (20.3%). The number of violations per subject ranged between 1
(Subject 5) to 16 (Subject 4).

the three cost conditions with c > 0 the subjects were presented with the
same sequences of offers in problems of sampling with or without recall.
Despite the difference in the sampling procedures and the optimal stopping rules for these procedures, the difference between the mean proportions of optimally solved problems for sampling Without recall (.652) and
with recall (.618) was not significant. Individual differences in these proportions were consistent over the two sampling conditions (r = .722,
.05 < p < .10).
Individual differences in the frequency of errors o f both types were
also fairly consistent over the two sampling conditions. A comparison of
Tables 4 and 5 shows that Subjects 2, 5, 6, and 7 made many more Type
II than Type I errors on both sampling conditions, while Subject 4 made
many more Type I than Type II errors on both sampling conditions. Subjeers 1 and 3 made more Type II than Type I errors on problems of sampling without recall but reversed their bias on problems with recall.
Another comparison between the two sampling procedures can be made
in terms of the proportion of problems violating the weak cut-off point
model. The mean proportion over subjects was .086 for sampling without
recall and .203 for sampling with recall, despite the fact that the optimal
stopping rule is a special ease of the weak cut-off point model in the latter
but not in the former ease.
DISCUSSION

The present approach to the study of choice behavior is based on the
comparison between the normative solution of a decision problem and the
observed solution employed by subjects. In a broader sense, therefore,
man is viewed as an intuitive statistician who acts in order to maximize
some specified criteria while operating on the basis of probabilistie information. The results of statistical decision theory, which are applicable
to such problems are, then, used as a baseline for evaluating his performanee. The success of the above approach depends not so much on the
degree to which human choices are optimal, but rather on the degree to
which choice behavior can be properly characterized in terms of the pattern Of departure from an optimal model. The use of d' in the theory of
signal detection as an index of performance (Green & Swets, 1966) is a
ease in point.
In this eontext,'problems of optional stopping are of special interest for
three major reasons. First, they represent an interesting set of problems
whose optimal solutions have been investigated in detail. Second, they
offer a wealth of experimental paradigms that can be investigated. Third,
they appear to model many sequential decisions made in everyday life,
which are typically accompanied by some process of collecting observations that is always costly.

In the present study, when errors were made, subjects exhibited a
tendency to terminate the search when they should have continued sampling. U~ader both sampling procedures and all cost conditions, the subject~ took on the average fewer offers than predicted by the corresponding
optimal stopping rules, and in general made larger errors when they
stopped the search too soon than when they stopped it too late. The study
of Rapoport and Tversky (1966) reported that subjects took fewer offers
than predicted under low cost conditions but more than the optimal numbet of offers when the cost increased. Their results, however, are not
strictly comparable to the results of the present study since the number
of offers in their study was unbounded, and the number of offers actually
sampled was compared to the expected number instead of the optimal
number of offers for the sequences actually presented.
Errors of both types were made by the subjects in about 1/3 of the
problems; the remaining problems were solved optimally. To assess the
descriptive adequacy of the optimal models, (4) and (8), they were compared to the cut-off point model. The weak cut-off point model accounted
for about 80% and 91%, respectively, of the problems under sampling with
and without recall. The difference between these proportions is consistent
with similar results reported by Rapoport and Tversky (1966), and may
be attributed to the different costs for failing to take the offer with the
highest value under the two sampling conditions.
Since the subjects had a great deal of prior exposure to the distributions
of the offers, there was no apparent reason for the subjects to change their
cut-off point between problems within the same cost condition. It was
reasonable, therefore, to attempt a test of the strong cut-off point model.
To avoid arbitrary assumptions concerning the cut-off point for each
subject in each cost condition, a range of values surrounding each cutoff point was located. Compared to the optimal models, which make unique predictions for both sampling conditions, the performance of the
strong cut-off point model was not impressive. Although it accounted for
a higher proportion of problems than the optimal models, we feel that its
slight advantage was well over-compensated by its considerably weaker
predictions.
The results of the present study suggest that the optimal model prorides a reasonably good account of the behavior of the subjects. This
conclusion is at, variance with the results of some other optional stopping
studies (Tversky & Edwards, 1966; Peterson & Beach, 1967) in which
the behavior of subjects was markedly nonoptimal. In all of these cases
the optimal stopping rule was neither obvious nor easily computable, so
they exclude the possibility of overt computations by the subjects. The
discrepancy between the findings cannot be explained, therefore, in terms
of the difficulty, or transparency, of ~he optimal solution. It may be a~-

tributed to other factors such as the nature of the task, familiarity with
the distributions of offers, and insensitivity of the optimal stopping rules
for deviations from optimality. I n the optional stopping tasks employed
in the present experiment as well as in W a l d - t y p e sequential stopping
tasks, moderately large deviations from the optimal stopping rule result
in relatively small decreases in expected gain. F u t u r e investigations of
optional stopping, which should devote more attention to sensitivity
analysis of the optimal stopping rules, m a y delineate the conditions under
which people do or do not behave optimally, and thereby further our
understanding of h u m a n decision making in both experimental and reallife contexts.
