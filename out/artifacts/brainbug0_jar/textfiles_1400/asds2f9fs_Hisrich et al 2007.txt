Janice Langan-Fox and Sharon Grant

Entrepreneurship is a major source of employment, economic growth, and innovation, promoting product and
service quality, competition, and economic ﬂexibility. It is
also a mechanism by which many people enter the society’s
economic and social mainstream, aiding culture formation,
population integration, and social mobility. This article
aims to illuminate research opportunities for psychologists
by exposing gaps in the entrepreneurship literature and
describing how these gaps can be ﬁlled. A “call to action”
is issued to psychologists to develop theory and undertake
empirical research focusing on ﬁve key topic areas: the
personality characteristics of entrepreneurs, the psychopathology of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial cognition,
entrepreneurship education, and international entrepreneurship. Methodological issues are discussed and recommendations provided. It is shown that psychologists can
help identify the factors that inﬂuence new venture creation
and success and inform the construction of public policy to
facilitate entrepreneurship.

ntrepreneurship, starting and managing a business
for the purpose of growth and proﬁt (Carland, Hoy,
Boulton, & Carland, 1984), can be traced back to
ancient Greece, where entrepreneurial activity brought independence and economic and social reform. Entrepreneurship is credited with the development of the assembly line,
the airplane, the computer, the contact lens, and DNA
ﬁngerprinting (Baumol, 2004). It is a major source of
employment, economic growth, and innovation and is an
integral part of the economic renewal process (Kuratko,
2003). Entrepreneurship is also a mechanism by which
many people enter the economic and social mainstream of
society, facilitating culture formation, population integration, and social mobility (Bednarzik, 2000).
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM; Reynolds, Bygrave, & Autio, 2004) described entrepreneurship
as a “world-wide phenomenon” that is on the increase. The
1990s saw major start-up activity in transition economies,
where private sector activity is relatively new (Peng, 2001).
There was a rise in entrepreneurial activity in the United
States in the late 1990s, peaking at the new millennium
(Neck, Zacharakis, Bygrave, & Reynolds, 2003). In 2002,
11% of the American adult workforce was involved in the
initial start-up phase or the development of a young busiSeptember 2007 ● American Psychologist

ness (Neck et al., 2003). Around the world, 9 in every 100
people of working age are involved in entrepreneurship,
with approximately 300 million in the venture creation
phase (Reynolds et al., 2004). The generation of the 21st
century has been branded Generation E, the most entrepreneurial since the Industrial Revolution (Kuratko, 2003).
Eighty percent of would-be entrepreneurs in the United
States are between the ages of 18 and 34, with approximately 6 million people in this age bracket actively trying
to start their own businesses (see Kuratko, 2003). Entrepreneurship is also an important source of employment for
women, and there has been signiﬁcant worldwide growth in
women’s self-employment (Hisrich & Öztürk, 1999; Langan-Fox, 2005). In 2004, three times more women than
men started ﬁrms in the United States. This could reﬂect
the service-oriented economy and the fact that the service
sector represents a strong area for women (Coughlin &
Thomas, 2002). A dominant trend in the 21st century is
likely to be ethnic entrepreneurship, with entrepreneurial
activity in the developing world increasing because of free
trade, the availability of venture capital, and the development of infrastructure (Morris, Schindehutte, & Lesser,
2002).

An Expanded Role for Psychology in
Entrepreneurship
With the rapid expansion of entrepreneurship, academic
interest in the topic has also grown, as evidenced by over
50 conferences and 1,000 publications each year (Filion,
1997). The entrepreneurship literature is vast, complex, and
multifaceted, spanning economics, sociology, business,
and psychology. A hallmark of the literature is an overabundance of theoretical work and a relative absence of
empirical work (Gregoire, Noel, Dery, & Bechard, 2004).
Furthermore, a recent review (Chandler & Lyon, 2001) of
the methodologies used in entrepreneurship research signaled a need to reduce common method variance, improve
construct validity and scale reliability, specify the level of

Methodological issues are also presented and recommendations provided. In what follows, we deﬁne entrepreneurship as well as different types of entrepreneurs and the
entrepreneurship process. We then discuss the role of psychologists in extending scientiﬁc inquiry into entrepreneurship, illustrating how entrepreneurship is fertile ground for

analysis, and conduct longitudinal research to capture the
entrepreneurship process over time. Psychology’s theoretical sophistication and methodological rigor should make
an important contribution to the development of a more
comprehensive view of entrepreneurship. Several psychological variables are crucial to entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial intent and success have been linked to social competence (Baron, 2000), motivation (Collins, Hanges, &
Locke, 2004; Kontos, 2003; McClelland & Winter, 1969;
Miron & McClelland, 1979; Segal, Borgia, & Schoenfeld,
2005), self-efﬁcacy (C. C. Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998;
Zhao, Seibert, & Hills, 2005), and willingness to bear
uncertainty (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). Other research
has investigated the common attributes of entrepreneurs
(Baum & Locke, 2004; Hisrich, 1990) and the effect of
variables such as gender (Lewis, 2006) and minority status
(Ede, Panigrahi, & Calcich, 1998) on the propensity to
consider entrepreneurship as a viable career option.
However, Baum, Frese, Baron, and Katz (2007, p. 1)
noted that “despite the belief that the entrepreneur’s
personal characteristics are important for new venture
success, the psychology of the entrepreneur has not been
thoroughly studied.”
In this article we aim to illuminate research opportunities for psychologists by exposing gaps in the entrepreneurship literature and describing how these gaps can be
ﬁlled. We present a call to action for psychologists to
develop theory and undertake empirical research focusing
on ﬁve key topic areas that are pertinent to psychology: the
personality characteristics of entrepreneurs, the psychopathology of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurship education, and international entrepreneurship.
These topic areas can be used to identify the factors that
affect new venture creation and success and to inform the

In the early 20th century, entrepreneurs were not frequently
distinguished from managers and were viewed mostly from
an economic perspective (see, e.g., Ely & Hess, 1937).
With the integration of business, managerial, and personal
terminology, the concept has evolved to include newness,
creating, organizing, risk taking, and wealth (Ronstadt,
1984). Entrepreneurs are found in all professions: architecture, business, education, engineering, law, medicine, and
psychology. To include all types of entrepreneurial behavior, we use the following deﬁnition as the foundation of this
article: “Entrepreneurship is the process of creating something new with value by devoting the necessary time and
effort, assuming the accompanying ﬁnancial, psychic, and
social risks, and receiving the resulting rewards” (Hisrich,
Peters, & Shepherd, 2005, p. 8).
Types of Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurship can be conceptualized along a continuum
ranging from entrepreneur at one end to administrator at the
other (Hisrich et al., 2005). It can also be viewed in
absolute terms, “new ﬁrm versus no new ﬁrm,” or in
relative terms, “more entrepreneurial versus less entrepreneurial.” An important distinction is that between invention
(opportunity discovery) and innovation (opportunity ex-

ploitation). Innovation, creating a new organization, product, or process, may be further distinguished from imitation, entering an established market (Ruef, Aldrich, &
Carter, 2003), reﬂecting Schumpeter’s (1952) notion of the
entrepreneur as an innovator.
Typologies of entrepreneurs. Several typologies have grouped entrepreneurs on the basis of their
psychological characteristics, with most typologies focusing on the personality characteristics of entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Miner, 1997, 2000; Muller & Gappisch, 2005). Some typologies have examined the psychological characteristics
of subpopulations of entrepreneurs and have formed typologies of potential entrepreneurs (Erikson, 2001), nascent entrepreneurs (Korunka, Frank, Lueger, & Mugler,
2003), female entrepreneurs (Langan-Fox & Roth, 1995),
retiree entrepreneurs (Singh & DeNoble, 2003), and fatherless entrepreneurs (Strenger & Burak, 2005). Typologies of
entrepreneurs are presented in Table 1.
There are so many permutations of entrepreneurs that
some sort of grouping is necessary if only for the beneﬁt of
parsimony. Typologies of entrepreneurs are beneﬁcial for
theory development because theories require the summarization of variable content in order to arrive at a set of
variables that make a meaningful whole. Clustering recognizable types will enable researchers to identify types and
replicate research ﬁndings, as well as aid analysis (e.g.,
discriminant analyses of variables associated with different
types). Types also have practical value inasmuch as one
can ascertain which types might prove to be more or less
successful entrepreneurs, and this has implications for selection and training.
Team entrepreneurs. A new business is more
likely to grow and survive if more than one person is

involved in the start-up phase (see Shane, 2003). Although
research has traditionally focused on solo entrepreneurs,
team entrepreneurs have become widespread and play a
signiﬁcant role in new product innovation, particularly in
high-tech industries, where a diversity of expertise is often
required (Chowdhury, 2005). The term team entrepreneurs
refers to a group of owners and managers of the same ﬁrm
(Ensley, Carland, & Carland, 2000). Family ﬁrms are a
common form of team entrepreneurs (Ucbasaran, Lockett,
Wright, & Westhead, 2003). Team entrepreneurs may be
able to avoid some of the functional and social-psychological pitfalls associated with solo entrepreneurship. For instance, multimember teams have immediate access to emotional and instrumental social support, a larger and a more
diverse set of skills, and a stronger capacity for innovation.
On the downside, coordinating and integrating team members may prove costly (Ucbasaran et al., 2003). Past research has examined topics such as friendship within entrepreneurial teams (Francis & Sandberg, 2000), lead
entrepreneurs (Ensley et al., 2000), team member entry and
exit (Ucbasaran et al., 2003), and team skill heterogeneity
and functional diversity (Ensley, Carland, & Carland,
1998) in the context of team process variables and team
effectiveness. Ensley et al. (2000, p. 60) noted that “little
investigative effort has been expended on the general behavioral and cognitive dynamics of an entrepreneurial
team,” suggesting an opportunity for future research in this
area.
Corporate entrepreneurs (“intrapreneurs”).
The entrepreneur construct can be broadened to include
those who exhibit innovative and enterprising behavior
within an existing organization, that is, corporate entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs; the distinction between entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship is that the former is for
self-gain and the latter for organizational gain (Hisrich,
1990). Intrapreneurship may encompass business venturing; competitive aggressiveness; proactiveness; process,
product, or service innovation; risk taking; and self-renewal (Christensen, 2004). There are relatively few “ofﬁcial” intrapreneurs because of the belief that ﬁrms must
wait for them to emerge or self select (Davis, 1999).
Intrapreneurship is crucial for the survival of the mature
organization (Jelinek, 1997). It can be used to harness
creative energy and enhance morale, and may have a snowball effect throughout the organization (Carrier, 1996;
Pryor & Shays, 1993). Any organization not involved in
intrapreneurial activity has probably made an unintentional
decision not to stay in business for long (Merriﬁeld, 1993).
Past research on intrapreneurship has largely centered on
determining the characteristics of intrapreneurs who lead
their ﬁrms to new venture success (Antoncic & Hisrich,
2003; Christensen, 2004; Davis, 1999; Russell, 1999).
Other research has addressed the role intrapreneurs play in
recognizing and developing new ventures both domestically and abroad (Altinay, 2004). In addition, Abraham
(1997) studied the relationship between intrapreneurship,
individualism, and collectivism.

<-----Page 5----->The Entrepreneurship Process
It is generally agreed that entrepreneurship is a multiphase
process consisting of entrepreneurial intent and opportunity
search, discovery/recognition, evaluation, and exploitation
(Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Shook, Priem, & McGee, 2003).
In modeling the entrepreneurship process, it is useful to
distinguish between supply side factors, emphasized by
psychologists, and demand side factors, emphasized by
economists (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Shaver, 1995). Lafuente and Salas (1989) noted that although demand side
factors such as the demand for goods and services and the
relative cost of inputs provide the stimuli for entrepreneurial activity by inﬂuencing the number of potential opportunities, they do not guarantee that such opportunities will
be recognized and exploited. They argued that supply side
factors such as psychological characteristics (e.g., attitudes,
preferences) are important for the study of entrepreneurship
because they inﬂuence the number of potential entrepreneurs. As such, psychological characteristics have to be
identiﬁed in policy oriented toward promoting entrepreneurial activity, which renders a purely economic view of
entrepreneurship insufﬁcient (Lafuente & Salas, 1989). Of
course, demand side factors (e.g., economy, technology)
also have an impact on new venture success, and this
should be noted by psychologists. The results of the entrepreneurship process are typically measured in terms of
ﬁnancial performance, yet both economic and noneconomic outcome variables are important given that venture
creation is often a rewarding outcome in itself (Hisrich et
al., 2005).

Entrepreneurship Research and
Practice: A Call to Action for
Psychology
In the following sections, we review and critique the literature on psychology and entrepreneurship. The discussion
is organized around ﬁve key topic areas that provide abundant opportunities for psychological research. We propose
a number of research questions that provide a call to action
for psychologists interested in entrepreneurship. The research questions aligned with each topic area are shown in
Table 2.
The Personality Characteristics
of Entrepreneurs
Research on personality and entrepreneurship has focused
on two broad research questions: Why do some people but
not others become entrepreneurs? Why do some people
make more successful entrepreneurs than others? (Shaver,
2007). The personality approach provided the impetus for
substantial research in the 1960s and 1970s, with research
on need for achievement (nAch; McClelland, 1961), the
most frequently studied personality characteristic, peaking
in the 1980s (Rauch & Frese, 2007).
Rauch and Frese (2007) described the personality
approach as a classic but controversial approach to the
psychology of entrepreneurship. Currently there is disagreement in the literature as to whether personality is a
580

useful construct in entrepreneurship research. For instance,
some research has shown that personality characteristics
fail to reliably distinguish between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs (e.g., managers) and generally account for
only a small proportion of the variance in entrepreneurial
success (Cromie, 2000; Hisrich, 2000). Meta-analytic research has revealed a small, positive relationship between
autonomy, internal locus of control, and risk-taking propensity and new venture creation and success, and a moderate, positive relationship between innovativeness, nAch,
and self-efﬁcacy and new venture creation and success.
Risk-taking propensity has a weaker association with both
outcome variables, and self-efﬁcacy has a stronger association with success (see Rauch & Frese, 2007, for a review).
However, it is possible that the role of personality in
entrepreneurship has been underestimated in past research
because of design and methodological limitations.
Improving Design and Measurement in
Personality-Based Research
Entrepreneurship as a process: The need
for longitudinal research. Entrepreneurship is a
complex, dynamic, multiphase process, yet the important
personality characteristics at each phase have not been
identiﬁed. Past research has tended to focus on the start-up
phase, with characteristics of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs compared on the basis of the assumption that
innate or stable characteristics cause the dependent variable
of entrepreneurship status (Davidsson, 2007). This approach is problematic for a number of reasons. First, such
an approach does not test for reversed causation. That is, it
is difﬁcult to evaluate whether the personality characteristics of entrepreneurs are a predisposing factor or are
learned from the role itself. Empirical work has generally
assumed the former perspective: that those displaying the
characteristics in question self-select into entrepreneurship
(see Shane, 2003). Second, the personality characteristics
that predict start-up behavior may not predict behavior later
on in the entrepreneurship process (Eckhardt & Shane,
2003). For example, the trait of openness may be suited to
creating a new venture (creative mindset) rather than sustaining one (managerial mindset) (Ciavarella, Buchholtz,
Riordan, Gatewood, & Stokes, 2004). Finally, distal person
characteristics are unlikely to be a strong predictor of a
proximal event (i.e., start-up; Davidsson, 2007). Longitudinal research is needed to identify antecedent personality
characteristics as well as the characteristics involved in
persistence and long-term success. Davidsson (2007) recommended using a behavioral aggregate of entrepreneurial
activity such as entrepreneurial career performance as an
alternative to the dichotomous outcome variable of entrepreneurship status (i.e., founder vs. nonfounder).
Matching of predictor and criterion variables. Studies of how successful entrepreneurs differ
from less successful entrepreneurs have also been problematic. Such studies have utilized a cross-level design in
which individual-level personality characteristics are used
to explain ﬁrm-level performance (Davidsson, 2007). Yet
personality characteristics should relate more strongly to

Predictor and criterion variables should be measured at the
same level of analysis.
Construct operationalization. Entrepreneurship has been operationalized inconsistently, and this fact
has hampered interstudy comparison (Hisrich et al., 2005).
For instance, Stewart and Roth (2001) argued that different
operational deﬁnitions of entrepreneurship may have obscured risk propensity differences between entrepreneurs
and managers. In their meta-analytic review, Stewart and
Roth found that entrepreneurs had a higher risk propensity
than managers and that this difference was greater for
growth-oriented entrepreneurs than for income-oriented entrepreneurs.
Valid and reliable measures. Measures designed speciﬁcally to assess entrepreneurial personality
characteristics have been of questionable validity and reliability (Cromie, 2000; Rauch & Frese, 2000). Rather than
trying to develop a suite of personality measures exclusively for entrepreneurs, which would be of limited value,
future research should use established measures from mainstream personality psychology. Coming from a long and
sound tradition, projective measures of motives (e.g.,
nAch) have proven utility in the entrepreneurship literature
(McClelland, 1961, 1987) and should be used alongside
psychometrically established measures of traits such as the
theoretically grounded and empirically validated NEO-Personality Inventory (a measure of 30 subtraits classiﬁed
according to the Big Five). The inclusion of such measures
should ensure that key motives and traits are not overlooked.
Moderating and mediating variables.
Rauch and Frese (2007) noted that broad taxonomies of
personality traits such as the Big Five have been less
frequently studied in the entrepreneurship literature and
that general traits have lower predictive validity than speciﬁc traits in this context owing to the speciﬁcity of performance measures (e.g., sales growth). They suggested
that (a) predictor and criterion variables should be matched
on the basis of broadness versus speciﬁcity and (b) the
effect of broad traits on new venture creation and success
may be mediated by speciﬁc traits. Nonperson mediator
and moderator variables should also be included in future
research (Davidsson, 2007). For instance, previous ﬁndings
for internal locus of control and risk propensity are heterogeneous, suggesting the presence of moderator variables
(Rauch & Frese, 2007).
Psychopathology: Exploring the “Dark Side”
of Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs “break the mold” by rejecting society’s prevailing norm of seeking employment with another organization or person (Teal & Carroll, 1999). Many entrepreneurs are misﬁts, difﬁcult employees who start their own
ﬁrms because they are unwilling to submit to authority and
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to work in a prestructured environment
(Kets de Vries, 1985). Kets de Vries (1985, p. 161) noted
582

that “entrepreneurs seem to be driven by a magniﬁcent
obsession,” and Winslow and Solomon (1988) described
entrepreneurs as mildly sociopathic. Yet the dysfunctional
psychological characteristics of entrepreneurs have received little attention. Past work has been based on clinical
case studies or small patient samples rather than large-scale
survey research with established measures (e.g., Kets de
Vries, 1985, 1996; Strenger & Burak, 2005), thus limiting
its objectivity and generalizability. Nonetheless, case study
research may be valuable as a lead-up to survey research.
The in-depth, case-by-case analysis of real-world behavior
may be superior for hypothesis development, and the longitudinal nature of case study research could provide insight into the interplay between individual, task, and environmental characteristics in the entrepreneurship process
(Davidsson, 2007).
McClelland (1961) attributed the dark side of entrepreneurs to high nAch coupled with inner-directedness.
Other work has suggested that entrepreneurs are characterized by a need for control, a sense of distrust, a desire for
applause, and defense mechanisms such as splitting (Kets
de Vries, 1996), that is, seeing the world as all good or all
bad (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). This may
have a catastrophic effect not only on entrepreneurs themselves but on communication, decision making, morale,
and productivity within their ﬁrms (Kets de Vries, 1985,
1996). In addition, psychopathology may be linked to careless, extravagant, or unethical entrepreneurial behavior. As
McClelland (1961, p. 331) noted more than 40 years ago,
“We do not know at the present time what makes an
entrepreneur more or less ethical in his (her) dealings but
obviously there are few problems of greater importance for
future research.” Understanding the psychopathology of
entrepreneurs has practical implications for entrepreneurs
who are heading for trouble and for investors who need to
assess whether entrepreneurs are likely to succeed
(Strenger & Burak, 2005).
Historically, entrepreneurship has been synonymous
with economic well being, far removed from psychological
well being. A possible starting point for clinical research is
the family background of entrepreneurs. Kets de Vries
(1996) identiﬁed the classic familial proﬁle as consisting of
an emotionally or physically absent father and a controlling, overbearing mother, with death, illness, and separation as prominent themes. He argued that any self-destructive behavior of entrepreneurs is likely to stem from
insecurity, low self-esteem, and a fragile sense of self.
Through starting their own ﬁrms, entrepreneurs establish a
secure foundation, take control, and obtain afﬁrmation and
recognition (Kets de Vries, 1985, 1996). Strenger and
Burak (2005) observed that many male entrepreneurs are
characterized by fatherlessness, the experience of growing
up with an absent, abusive, insufﬁcient, or weak father.
They reasoned that fatherlessness may provide the future
entrepreneur with the incentive to create his own environment in much the same way that lack of paternal authority
does in Freud’s Leonardo hypothesis. However, although
entrepreneurs cope with fatherlessness by transforming it
into an asset, only those who psychologically come to
September 2007 ● American Psychologist

<-----Page 8----->terms with their father’s failure (entrepreneurs who become
their own fathers) will succeed. In contrast, those who
cannot let go of their rage (self-destroyers) or inner void
(grandiose dreamers) will fail (see Table 1 for details).
Entrepreneurs who “become their own fathers” typically
grow up with a neglectful father, whereas self-destroyers
typically grow up with an abusive one (Strenger & Burak,
2005).
The start-up experience is ﬁlled with anxiety, enthusiasm, frustration, and hard work. The failure rate is high
because of competition, poor sales, restricted capital, and
lack of managerial ability (Hisrich et al., 2005). Financial
and emotional risk can also be high. It takes a complex
personality to survive the troubled waters of new venture
creation. Entrepreneurs’ personality quirks and mix of creative and irrational impulses may be responsible for their
drive, energy, and success, making them interesting subjects for research (Kets de Vries, 1985).
Entrepreneurial Cognition
Cognition is the nouveau area in the entrepreneurship literature (Baron, 2004). Entrepreneurial cognition can be
deﬁned as “knowledge structures that people use to make
assessments, judgments or decisions involving opportunity
evaluation, venture creation and growth” (R. K. Mitchell et
al., 2002, p. 97). Entrepreneurial cognition is a valuable
topic given that cognitive strategies can be learned or
mastered through training (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Although research is in a formative stage, work to date has
suggested that the cognitive variables that distinguish entrepreneurs from nonentrepreneurs are opportunity recognition, risk perception, and cognitive shortcuts.
Entrepreneurs appear to make cognitive leaps about
potential opportunities long before they can be rationally
and systematically evaluated (Busenitz et al., 2003). Entrepreneurs may have a special ability for identifying opportunities that other people fail to recognize (Shane, 2003).
Recent attention to opportunity recognition (the cognitive
process through which opportunities are identiﬁed) has
been a major theoretical development in the entrepreneurship literature (Baron, 2006). Opportunity recognition has
been attributed to active search (Gilad, Kaish, & Ronen,
1989); alertness or “notice without search” (Gaglio & Katz,
2001; Kirzner, 1979); prior knowledge and cognitive
mechanisms (this may overlap with perception; see below;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000); ability, efﬁcacy, motivation, and desirability (Hostager, Neil, Decker, & Lorentz,
1998); and, more recently, pattern recognition or “connecting the dots” (Baron, 2006). However, despite a plethora of
theoretical work, exploration of opportunity recognition is
undeveloped in empirical work (Gaglio & Katz, 2001).
Given the methodological challenge of capturing opportunity recognition at its point of execution, experimental and
laboratory research (e.g., computer simulation) could be a
useful research paradigm.
The classic image of the entrepreneur is one of an
adventurous, bold, and visionary risk taker. Entrepreneurs
strike a balance between aversive and opportunistic risk.
The failure to pursue a potentially proﬁtable venture may
September 2007 ● American Psychologist

be just as costly in the long term (i.e., “sinking the boat”
risk vs. “missing the boat” risk; Dickson & Giglierano,
1986). As described earlier, the risk-taking behavior of
entrepreneurs has been explained in terms of a stable disposition, that is, a higher risk-taking propensity (McClelland, 1961; Stewart & Roth, 2001). However, recent work
on entrepreneurial cognition has suggested that entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs differ not in regard to their risk
propensity per se (i.e., conscious acceptance of risk) but
rather in how they perceive risk (Busenitz, 1999; Busenitz
& Barney, 1997). The central thesis of this work is that
entrepreneurs are characterized by lower risk perception,
thus giving the illusion of greater risk tolerance. Research
has shown that entrepreneurs categorize ambiguous business scenarios signiﬁcantly more positively than do nonentrepreneurs (Palich & Bagby, 1995) and rate the probability of securing desired career attributes (e.g., leadership)
signiﬁcantly higher than do nonentrepreneurs (Amit, MacCrimmon, Zietsma, & Oesch, 2000). Entrepreneurs also
appear to use cognitive shortcuts (e.g., heuristics) in decision making that lower their risk perception (Busenitz &
Barney, 1997; Keh, Foo, & Lim, 2002; Simon, Houghton,
& Aquino, 1999). However, an experimental study (Forlani
& Mullins, 2000) found that entrepreneurs’ decision making (new venture choice) was inﬂuenced by inherent risk,
perceived risk, and risk propensity, which suggests a more
complex decision-making process.
Applying cognitive shortcuts may be the only way
forward for entrepreneurs given the emotion, fatigue, information overload, novelty, uncertainty, and time pressure
associated with new venture creation (Alvarez & Busenitz,
2001; Baron, 1998). Busenitz and Barney (1997, p. 10)
argued that without cognitive shortcuts, “many entrepreneurial decisions would never be made.” On the other hand,
cognitive shortcuts may also give rise to cognitive error
(Busenitz et al., 2003). Baron (1998) proposed that entrepreneurs may be more susceptible to cognitive error because of affect infusion, counterfactual thinking, planning
fallacy, self-serving bias, and self-justiﬁcation. However,
only one of these cognitive mechanisms, counterfactual
thinking, has been empirically investigated. Baron (2000)
reported that entrepreneurs were in fact less susceptible to
counterfactual thinking than were potential entrepreneurs
and nonentrepreneurs. An important question is whether
successful entrepreneurs are less prone to cognitive shortcuts and errors than are less successful entrepreneurs
(Baron, Frese, & Baum, 2007). Notably, no research to date
has explored the use of cognitive shortcuts in a naturalistic
setting, for instance, over the course of the entrepreneurship process.
A cognitive variable that has been overlooked in the
entrepreneurship literature is general ability, that is, intelligence (Markman, 2007; Rauch & Frese, 2007; Sternberg,
2004). This is surprising given the well-established relationship between general ability and job performance in the
occupational literature (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998). Only a
handful of studies have investigated the general ability of
entrepreneurs. Ray and Singh (1980) found that the general
ability of farmer entrepreneurs predicted growth rate, that
583

<-----Page 9----->is, the difference between their outputs from 1970 to 1974.
A longitudinal study (van Praag & Cramer, 2001) found
that academic intelligence at age 12, measured by knowledge comprehension tests on school subjects, was a positive predictor of entrepreneurial talent in adulthood. Creativity, intuition, and divergent thinking should also be
important, but these aspects of cognitive ability have likewise been neglected in entrepreneurship research (J. R.
Mitchell, Friga, & Mitchell, 2005; Shane, 2003). Sternberg
(2004) argued that successful entrepreneurship is likely to
require a blend of analytical, creative, and practical intelligence (“successful intelligence”). Busenitz and Arthurs
(2007, p. 134) theorized that entrepreneurs need entrepreneurial capabilities, “the ability to identify new opportunities and develop the resource base needed to start a ﬁrm,”
and dynamic capabilities, “the ability to reconﬁgure the
ﬁrm’s resource base to meet changing demands.”
It is evident that the array of characteristics needed for
entrepreneurship is extensive. At the same time, it is unrealistic to expect all budding entrepreneurs to possess these
characteristics. Entrepreneurship education, discussed below, can be used to “make a person a more competent and
a more professionalized business owner” (Katz, 2007, p.
211).
Entrepreneurship Education
The notion that it is possible to boost new venture creation
and success through education is gaining popularity, and
there is increasing support for the idea of entrepreneurship
as a discipline that can be taught and learned (Kuratko,
2003). Katz (2007, p. 209) summarized the evidence that
entrepreneurship education is associated with entrepreneurial activity and success and noted, “Although evidence is
widely dispersed and unintegrated, the effort does seem to
work”: Entrepreneurship MBA graduates are more likely to
be involved in new venture creation or ownership than are
nonentrepreneurship MBA graduates; small ﬁrms that receive assistance from a Small Business Development Center (e.g., one-on-one counseling, training) show a higher
rate of survival and growth than do other small ﬁrms; and
the ﬁrms of entrepreneurship MBA graduates show a
higher rate of sales and employment growth than do the
ﬁrms of nonentrepreneurship MBA graduates. However,
research incorporating a Gene ⫻ Environment approach is
needed before the traditional hypothesis that entrepreneurs
are born, not made (the proposed “entrepreneurship gene”)
can be ruled out.
There is also evidence to suggest that characteristics
associated with entrepreneurial success, such as achievement motivation, can be learned. McClelland and Winter
(1969) developed an achievement motivation training program for entrepreneurs based on the rationale that increasing the strength of this motive may increase a country’s
economic development. Small businessmen in India were
trained how to think, talk, and act like people who score
high on nAch. Results indicated that there was an increase
in business activity two years after training. Similarly,
achievement motivation training for minority business people in the United States was associated with an increase in
584

monthly sales, personal income, and proﬁt six months after
training (Miron & McClelland, 1979).
Entrepreneurship education may take the form of an
academic program, entrepreneurship training, and individual or peer coaching (see Katz, 2007). Entrepreneurship
education is currently a hot topic, and there has been a
substantial increase in the number of courses offered in the
past 20 years— over 2,000 courses, 1,500 schools, and 100
funded centers in the United States alone (Kuratko, 2003).
A similar trend has emerged in Europe and China. For
example, the German government recently funded 25
chairs in entrepreneurship, and in China courses are taught
in many higher education institutions (Hisrich, 2005).
Entrepreneurs need to be multiskilled (Markman,
2007). Even experienced, motivated, and visionary entrepreneurs are not immune to failure (Shane, 2003) and may
beneﬁt from education to hone their skills as their ﬁrms
expand or change direction. Given what we have learned
about entrepreneurs’ cognitive shortcuts (see above), it is
possible that entrepreneurs fall prey to erroneous decision
making that could be avoided through appropriate education. In addition, entrepreneurs’ possible dysfunctional personality characteristics may mean that they lack the social
skills necessary to succeed. Baron and Markman (2000)
highlighted the importance of social competencies, including social adaptability, social perception, impression management, and persuasion and inﬂuence. Busenitz and
Arthurs (2007) stated that many entrepreneurs lack the
managerial and technical skills needed for developing an
organization. Baum, Locke, and Smith (2001) found that
owner–manager CEOs’ speciﬁc competencies (e.g., technical skills) but not general competencies (e.g., diagnostic
use of concepts) directly predicted new venture growth.
Baum and Locke (2004) introduced the construct of new
resource skill, that is, skill in ﬁnding capital and human
resources and setting up new systems, and found that it was
a signiﬁcant predictor of venture growth.
Behaviorally speciﬁc skills or competencies are invisible assets that can be exploited and leveraged. McClelland
(1987) identiﬁed several competencies that distinguished
successful from less successful entrepreneurs: assertiveness, commitment to work, efﬁciency orientation, initiative, and systematic planning. It may be difﬁcult to establish and measure entrepreneurial competencies given that
we do not have a complete understanding of how competencies change over the life cycle of the business. Markman
(2007) argued that what is needed is a knowledge, skills,
and abilities (KSAs) analysis of entrepreneurship. Although there has been extensive research on the personality
characteristics of entrepreneurs, there is a relative absence
of research on the KSAs needed to get a venture off the
ground and make it ﬂourish. A constructive way forward
would be to document the tasks that entrepreneurs need to
perform to start up a business and lead it to success. By
beginning with job analysis and deciphering the tasks that
are common and unique to particular phases (e.g., start-up)
and types (e.g., team-based) of entrepreneurship, psychologists will be able to identify important KSAs throughout
the entrepreneurial process. A comprehensive taxonomy of
September 2007 ● American Psychologist

<-----Page 10----->entrepreneurial tasks will allow researchers to better test
and apply entrepreneurship theory by enabling interstudy
comparison. Furthermore, knowledge of the KSAs associated with different entrepreneurial tasks would be valuable
for selection and training. For instance, the KSAs associated with start-up could be used as a tool for assessing
people’s natural potential for entrepreneurship.
A recent special issue on entrepreneurship education
in the Academy of Management Learning & Education
journal identiﬁed several areas for development, including
teaching opportunity recognition as a core competency
(DeTienne & Chandler, 2004) and educating entrepreneurs
about emotion management in the context of learning from
failure (Shepherd, 2004). Given the importance of protecting investor capital, ethics education is also a priority
(Bechard & Gregoire, 2005).
Entrepreneurship as a Global Phenomenon
The entrepreneurship literature is characterized by a lack of
reliable, internationally comparable data (Hisrich, HonigHaftel, McDougall, & Oviatt, 1996; Thomas & Mueller,
2000). Yet there are two major reasons why international
research should be given more attention. First, given the
global economy, a critical new challenge for entrepreneurs
is working on an international scale. Entrepreneurs are no
longer restricted to the domestic market, and international
entrepreneurship is emerging as the new breed of business
activity (Dess et al., 2003). Furthermore, even locally oriented entrepreneurs must be aware of international competitors, customers, employees, and suppliers (Hisrich,
Vahcic, & Glas, 1999). Morris et al. (2002) argued that
recognizing cultural similarities and differences is crucial
to building trust when negotiating, purchasing, selling, and
working on an international scale. Second, cultivating native industry through indigenous entrepreneurship may
provide a solution to unemployment and economic dependence in the developing world (W. Chen, 2000). Understanding the relationship between culture and entrepreneurship is vital to the internationalization of entrepreneurship
theory including policy to promote new venture creation on
a global scale (Thomas & Mueller, 2000). The role of
cultural values in entrepreneurship and economic development outside the Western context has received less attention, with past research focusing on environmental factors
such as capital, labor, and so forth (Morris et al., 2002).
A major source of information on international differences in entrepreneurship is the Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor (GEM), an ongoing initiative based on large-scale
household sampling across 40 countries, including the
United States. Entrepreneurial activity is measured using
two indices, the Total Entrepreneurial Activity index (those
active in starting a new business) and the Firm Entrepreneurial Activity index (innovation and growth in established ﬁrms) (Reynolds et al., 2004). GEM data are available to participating institutions for secondary data
analysis. Although secondary data analysis is attractive in
terms of cost and time efﬁciency, a major limitation of this
data set and other archival entrepreneurship data sets (e.g.,
the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics) is that they
September 2007 ● American Psychologist

typically focus on sociological variables (e.g., personal
background). Psychological variables are often lacking or
have to be approximated using distant, single-item proxy
measures (Davidsson, 2007).
Culture and entrepreneurship. Cultural variation may stem from ethnic, language, national, regional,
religious, or social class variation (Basu & Altinay, 2002).
Culture may affect the supply of entrepreneurs by inﬂuencing preferences for entrepreneurship (Davidsson, 1995)
or the personal characteristics of the population (Davidsson
& Wiklund, 1997). Alternatively, culture may affect entrepreneurship indirectly via contextual factors. For instance,
a culture’s prevailing attitude toward entrepreneurship
could affect the amount of ﬁnancial support available to
entrepreneurs or inﬁltrate the education system to determine the amount and quality of entrepreneurship education
and training (Hisrich, 1996). For example, America’s individualistic culture is amenable to entrepreneurship (Lee &
Peterson, 2000). Walt Disney, Sam Walton, Ray Kroc, and
Bill Gates embody the essence of entrepreneurship and the
American entrepreneurial dream (Burn, 2001), and it is
through entrepreneurship that the majority of the Fortune
200 companies were realized (Purrington & Bettcher,
2001). The United States is currently a world leader in
ﬁnancial support for entrepreneurship (Reynolds et al.,
2004). In contrast, Russia has been forestalled by the persisting culture of the communist regime, although a transition to a more entrepreneurial culture is now evident (Lee
& Peterson, 2000). Russian entrepreneurs typically rely on
personal funding and thus have restricted capital (Puffer &
McCarthy, 2001).
Empirical studies of culture and entrepreneurship have
tended to focus on Hofstede’s (1980) conceptualization of
national culture (i.e., individualism– collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity–femininity) (Hayton, George, & Zahra, 2002). A review of
empirical studies on national culture and entrepreneurship
(Hayton et al., 2002) indicated that (a) high individualism,
low uncertainty avoidance, and high power distance are
associated with national entrepreneurship; (b) individualism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance are related
to entrepreneurial characteristics such as cognitive scripts
and traits; (c) entrepreneurs are higher in power distance,
individualism, and masculinity and lower on uncertainty
avoidance than are nonentrepreneurs; and (d) Hofstede’s
cultural dimensions are meaningfully related to aspects of
corporate entrepreneurship such as entry mode, innovation,
spin-offs, and strategic renewal.
Tung, Walls, and Frese (2007) noted that despite
evidence linking culture with venture creation, success, and
failure, the culture– entrepreneurship relationship is inconsistent, small, and temporally unstable, with the nonequivalence of measures (e.g., cross-cultural differences in response styles and reference groups) contributing to this
problem. The blurred empirical distinction between cultural values and individual values is also problematic. For
instance, culture is conceptualized at the national level but
measured at the individual level (Davidsson, 2007). Hayton
et al. (2002) identiﬁed the relationship between culture and
585

<-----Page 11----->heuristics or scripts as a fruitful area for future research
given that such characteristics (unlike individual values)
are conceptually removed from cultural values. The development of a new measure of national culture focusing on
cultural dimensions that are directly relevant to entrepreneurship is pertinent. For instance, Hofstede’s (1980)
broadly deﬁned taxonomy (developed in the organizational
context) might not adequately capture cultural dimensions
that relate to entrepreneurship and/or cultural heterogeneity
within a country or region (Basu & Altinay, 2002; Hayton
et al., 2002). Basu and Altinay (2002) found that cultural
dimensions such as attitudes toward education, business
experience, family ties, family tradition in business, migration motives, and religion predicted business entry motives,
pattern of start-up ﬁnance, and family involvement in business.
Culture, religion, and entrepreneurship.
“Culture is greatly inﬂuenced by religion since religion
determines a person’s basic values and beliefs” (Basu &
Altinay, 2002, p. 373). Yet, despite its status as a key
component of culture and ethnic identity, religion has been
underresearched in the international entrepreneurship literature. Bellu and Flume (2004) found that religion moderated the effect of pursuing material wealth on life satisfaction. Personal religiosity was associated with higher life
satisfaction. Dodd and Seaman (1998) argued that religion
may act as a muniﬁcence factor for entrepreneurship as
well as strengthening (or weakening) other environmental
muniﬁcence factors. For instance, religion may inﬂuence
one’s decision to become an entrepreneur by supporting (a)
independent economic activity; (b) entrepreneurs’ subsequent business strategies via personal religiosity (e.g., faith,
morals); or (c) entrepreneurs’ social networks (e.g., access
to professional advice and support; Dodd & Seaman,
1998). Dodd and Seaman (1998) found that there were no
signiﬁcant differences between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs with respect to religious afﬁliation (belonging
to a particular religion), adherence (attending religious
meetings), and impact (difference religion made in one’s
life). Furthermore, religious adherence was unrelated to
entrepreneurial status or success. Note, however, that this
study was based on a British sample in which religious
behavior was generally low and skewed toward Christianity. Thus, it is possible that further research combining
greater religious diversity with a between-groups design
may reveal a stronger relationship between religiosity and
entrepreneurship. In addition, the effect of religion on
entrepreneurship may be mediated or moderated by other
variables. Entrepreneurs interact with bankers, investors,
customers, and employees, who form a major resource
network that is vital to the longevity of the business (Baron,
2000; Hisrich, 1990). Entrepreneurs might be able to use
their religious afﬁliations to help develop such networks
(Dodd & Seaman, 1998).
Policy and entrepreneurship. Countries need
a strategy for entrepreneurship. The challenge is forging a
culture to encourage entrepreneurial activity. Governments
have the potential to inﬂuence the rate of new venture
creation through policy that is either directly or indirectly
586

related to entrepreneurship (Hisrich et al., 2005). An interesting case is Northern Ireland, where government funding
was used to kick-start the war-torn economy, making entrepreneurship an important cornerstone in the country’s
economic revival (Hisrich, 1988). Deng Xiaoping’s dismantling of the communist system in China in the late
1970s is another example of how policy can have a dramatic impact on the development of entrepreneurship (see
Tung et al., 2007). The British government has been proactive in implementing a strategy for entrepreneurship that
focuses on encouraging the start-up market; developing
regulatory policy; increasing access to capital; improving
services for small ﬁrms; building skills to grow ﬁrms;
promoting entrepreneurship among the disadvantaged; underpinning entrepreneurship with resources; and evaluating
results (Gome, 2005). To further entrepreneurship worldwide, Reynolds et al. (2004) suggested that international
policy should focus on decreasing the cost of registering
ﬁrms, giving ofﬁcial recognition to property ownership,
reducing government control over national economic activity, and providing training.

Conclusion: The Way Forward
As a catalyst for innovation and job creation, entrepreneurship has signiﬁcance for prosperity and well-being at the
individual, family, community, and national levels. There
is a wealth of research on entrepreneurship in business,
economics, management, and sociology, but psychology’s
contribution is yet to be fully exploited, demanding this
“call to action” for psychologists. There are a number of
gaps in the literature that need to be ﬁlled, and in this article
we have identiﬁed research opportunities for psychologists
in ﬁve key topic areas: the personality characteristics of
entrepreneurs, the psychopathology of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurship education, and
international entrepreneurship. These topic areas can be
divided into two clusters: the characteristics of the entrepreneurs themselves, namely, individual differences such
as personality, psychopathology, and cognition, and psychological variables that relate to the infrastructure of the
entrepreneur’s environment, speciﬁcally, system variables
such as education and national factors, including culture
and policy.
With regard to the characteristics of entrepreneurs,
research opportunities reside in clarifying the role of personality in the entrepreneurship process through longitudinal research and appropriate matching of predictor and criterion
variables; improving construct operationalization and measurement (e.g., validity, reliability); exploring mediating and
moderating variables in the personality– entrepreneurship relationship; and examining the psychopathology of entrepreneurs, including dysfunctional entrepreneurial behavior and
its link to familial and/or work history. The study of entrepreneurial cognition, a nouveau area of entrepreneurship research, can provide a fresh outlook on the characteristics of
entrepreneurs. Research opportunities abound in investigating
the nature of opportunity recognition; examining cognitive
shortcuts and their impact on success and failure; and establishing the importance of general and speciﬁc cognitive abilSeptember 2007 ● American Psychologist

<-----Page 12----->ities for the entrepreneurship process. The possibility that an
entrepreneurship gene may determine the personality and cognitive characteristics of entrepreneurs must also be given
research attention.
Research on the infrastructure of the entrepreneur’s
immediate and broader sociocultural environment is
needed to improve entrepreneurship education and promote
local, ethnic, and international entrepreneurship. Research
opportunities include identifying the KSAs that underpin
entrepreneurship and incorporating these in education and
training; establishing a reliable, internationally comparable
database that includes psychological variables; improving
studies of the culture– entrepreneurship relationship by addressing the level-of-analysis problem and developing new
measures of national culture; and, ﬁnally, exploring the role
of religion in entrepreneurship.
This article should serve as a stimulus for a new era of
research on the psychology of entrepreneurship. Psychology’s contribution to entrepreneurship research and practice has the potential to revolutionalize our understanding
of the dynamics of new venture creation and success. Most
entrepreneurs start out with a dream: a magniﬁcent obsession. As we have shown, there are several psychological
variables that may inﬂuence the realization of this dream.
These variables will need to be translated into practical
solutions if the dream is to come true. The dream can be
accomplished; psychology can help.
