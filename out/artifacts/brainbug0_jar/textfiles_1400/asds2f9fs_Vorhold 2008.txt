This chapter provides an overview of studies in the field of neuroscience that investigate some of
the processes and concepts of risk perception, risky choice, and decision making under risk. First,
early studies in the field of neuroscience addressing the diminished decision-making abilities in
lesion patients are presented. A classical task in this research field is described along with its
neural implications. After this, the underlying model, its hypotheses, and neuronal implications
are discussed. Different aspects within risky decision making, such as the influence of memory,
inhibition, motivation, and personality, on risky choice and the respective underlying neuronal
substrate are described. After this, studies of risky decision making in healthy subjects are reviewed. A selection of studies shows that theories focusing on cognitive aspects only have to be
enriched in order to allow for additional aspects within risky decision making (e.g., emotion). Next,
the classical economic approaches and the development of theories incorporating further aspects
within economical decision making and the underlying neuronal substrate will be presented. Finally, research in the field of neuroeconomics, focusing on the role of social decision making and
evaluative judgment within risky decision making, is reviewed.

Introduction
In recent years, growing knowledge, new technologies, diseases, environmental challenges, and progress
in science have broadened existing definitions and concepts of risk. The more complex models and definitions of risk become, the more hope is put into new
technologies to provide a deeper understanding. Brain
imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allow studying the neural basis
of various cognitive functions by investigating changes
in cerebral blood flow, which is an indirect measure

of oxygen use at specific locations in the brain. fMRI
provides insight into the spatial distribution and dynamics of brain activation as a function of stimulus
presentation or task performance or as a consequence
of disease or medication. At first glance, fMRI seems to
be a straightforward, promising, and convincing tool
that directly accesses cognitive function and provides
a window into the brain. It offers the “extraordinary
opportunity” to observe the processes of the human
brain,1 and it is seen as the “key technology of our
times.”2
Especially enthusiastic are researchers in fields that
are in a stalemate concerning new ideas for further research. “The neuroscience revolution occurred when
. . . scientists realized that the best hope for understanding the workings of the brain comes from an interdisciplinary approach, a combination of traditional
approaches to yield a new synthesis, a new perspective”(p. 4).1 For example, researchers in the field of
neuroeconomics hope to find evidence for the neuronal substrate underlying risk perception or decision

making under risk. By connecting these processes to
behavior, they hope to gain a better understanding of
the phenomenon.3 Nonetheless, even if imaging techniques allow investigating neural correlates of cognitive
function, certain limitations in temporal and spatial
resolution restrict design and experimental manipulation and hence the research questions that can be
answered with this technique.
This chapter provides a critical overview of neuroscience studies that investigate processes and concepts potentially relevant to risk perception and
communication. First, early studies by Bechara and
colleagues addressing the issue of risk perception in
patients with lesions within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are presented.4–12 The classical gambling task in research fields investigating
risk decision making is introduced, and the neural
implications are presented and critiqued. After this,
the somatic marker hypothesis (SMH) and its neuronal implications are discussed. Different aspects
of risk perception using such decision-under-risk
paradigms are shown. In particular, slight changes
in the tasks result in an altered underlying neuronal substrate. Neural changes are supposed to
highlight the influence of memory, inhibition, motivation, and personality on risky choice. After
this, the underlying neuronal substrate of risky and
informed decision making in healthy subjects is
summarized.
In the subsequent section, a selection of studies in
neuroscience is introduced that show that theories focusing only on cognitive processes have to be enriched
with models that further distinguish possible emotional
aspects of risk decisions. In the next section, risky
choices investigated with economic models are introduced. This section will start with classical approaches
and lead to the development of Prospect Theory (PT)
and its assumptions. The hypothesized underlying neuronal substrate as well as the problems arising will be
described. Finally, the aspects in neuroeconomic studies focusing on social decision making and the role of
evaluative judgment within risky decision making will
be critically discussed.

The Iowa Gambling Task and Neural
Implications when Administered to Lesion
Patients
In the field of neuroscience, studies simulating reallife risky decision making in a laboratory setting detect the cognitive and neural mechanisms that, when
damaged, are responsible for impairments. Such impairments have been observed, for example, in pa-

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences

tients with damage to certain sectors of the VMPFC. a
The problems that result occur especially within the
personal and social functioning of the patients. Symptoms manifest themselves, for example, in obliviousness toward the future consequences of actions and
the reward-related guidance of behavior.8 The literature gives a detailed description of the symptoms these
patients suffer.13,14 Beyond difficulties with the cognitively demanding aspects of a task (e.g., estimation
of prices), the ability to understand, experience, and
effectively use emotions is especially impaired.14
Bechara et al.8 introduced the “Iowa Gambling
Task” (IGT), an experimental neuropsychological task
in which participants search for monetary payoffs
by selecting cards from several decks arrayed before
them. Each deck holds a certain number of winning/rewarding and loosing/punishing cards, and the
relative proportions of these cards can be learned by
repeated drawing. Healthy subjects are able to make
successful choices based on their intuitive estimates of
which decks are risky and which decks are profitable
in the long run. They show an improvement over time.
They fail, however, to give an account of the net gains
and losses associated with any single deck. In their initial article, Bechara and colleagues introduce E.V.R.,
a prototypical patient with damaged VMPFCs who
behaves disadvantageously in real-life decision making
(pp. 7–8).8 To determine the specific influence of the
VMPFC on decision making under risk, subsequent research with the IGT included six “E.V.R.-like subjects”
and compared their performances to nine control patients with lesions in other brain regions (p. 10).8, b
The researchers found this task detects impairments in
brain-damaged patients. Such patients perform “defectively in this task, and . . . the defect is stable over
time” (p. 13).8
Studying patient deficits in gambling tasks enable
researchers to compare performance within or even
between patient groups. Moreover, such studies allow
the assignment of behavioral deficits to particular brain
areas when lesions are shared or overlap. However,
there are some constraints of fMRI techniques that
limit the ability of these studies to provide an exact
causal relationship between lesions and the behavior in
deficit. For example, patient studies usually investigate

a
The VMPFC, as classified by the Iowa group, includes the medial
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and parts of the lateral OFC. Moreover, it
overlaps with medial Brodmann’s areas 10, 11, and 12 and lower Brodmann’s areas 24, 25, and 32.5,6 It is important to note that other authors
refer to a similar region when using the term OFC.15,16
b
Detailed descriptions of the patients’ lesions are given in Bechara
et al.12

<-----Page 2----->Vorhold: The Neuronal Substrate of Risky Choice

a few patients only, which makes statistically meaningful analyses difficult. Moreover, although the lesions
of patients overlap in a region of interest, such as the
VMPFC, patients’ lesions are not of an equal size and
hence cover heterogeneous regions of the brain.
It is also important to note that in different studies
the labeling of brain areas varies. The data regarding individual brain structure, once acquired, has to
be spatially preprocessed and normalized via (automated) transformations in order to match a standard
brain physiology template. This enables the researcher
to make anatomical and physiological statements and
comparisons between the brains of different patients.
Functional data is likewise normalized to the template,
enabling the assignment of functions to specific brain
structures. These transformations and normalizations
can be tricky when the brain of a patient is physically
damaged. Thus, it is important to be aware of the
need in patient or lesion studies to consider alternative
techniques to normalize the data in order to overcome
a mismatch between template, image, and functional
data.17

The Somatic Marker Hypothesis
and Its Neural Implications
The inability of patients to decide advantageously
(i.e. to, learn from an experience in order to gain a
reward) led to the formulation of the SMH.14 The
SMH states that, in an uncertain situation where
different behavioral alternatives can be chosen, somatic markers guide behavior by excluding previously
experienced emotionally charged behaviors. Somatic
markers can be either “primary inducers,” like unconditioned pleasurable and aversive stimuli, or “secondary inducers,” such as memorable learned entities
that are generated by recall. The inducers produce
a somatic state, which in turn can overtly be perceived as a feeling or covertly remain as a representation at the level of the brain stem.18,19 Somatic states
reached through secondary inducers enable the reexperiencing of a feeling that is associated with something. All of these somatic states, either negative or positive, combine to produce one overall somatic state. This
overall state provides important signals to the brain,
including the overall emotional state (via insula, somatosensory cortex) and it suggests overtly or covertly how
decisions should be biased when choosing between
alternatives.5,8,10,14,20
Bechara and colleagues8 state that the IGT detects
brain-injured patients’ impairments in a controlled setting. They assume that patients’ performances reflect
“their real-life inability to decide advantageously, especially in personal and social matters. . . . In life, as in

43

the task, an exact calculation of the future outcomes is
not possible and choices must be based on approximations” (p. 13).8 Moreover, with the SMH the respective
roles of primary and secondary inducers in decision
making can be differentiated.14 Conclusions can also
be drawn about the underlying neuronal substrate of
the inducers as these are believed to be regulated by
different brain regions.
The VMPFC is the part of the brain most crucial in
encoding secondary inducers via dispositional associations, i.e., it recalls the learned entities and bodily states
from past experiences. The VMPFC is thought to reactivate representations of a situation or state by recruiting this information from other areas in the brain. Secondary inducers can be recalled from areas representing a change in the body, like the somatosensory cortex,
insula, cingulate, basal ganglia, and brain stem nuclei.21 For primary inducers, i.e., unconditioned emotional stimuli, the VMPFC recruits information from
the amygdala.4,9 It appears that damage to the amygdala alters performance in the IGT because of its role
in linking stimuli to affective attributes. The VMPFC
holds the role of a decision maker over many alternative inputs received from other areas as well.4 Furthermore, neurotransmitter systems, like the dopaminergic
system in the brain stem, are thought to bias the action
of the somatic states in response selection11,14,21 .
The assumptions of the SMH were tested by the
Iowa laboratory in several studies5,8,10,12 . Results show
that somatic markers, as measured by skin conductance responses (SCRs), allow people to make better
choices even before conscious knowledge is accessible.
In the initial study, the authors provide three different explanations for the impaired patients’ behavior:
the patient is extremely sensitive to reward, is insensitive to punishment, or is generally insensitive to future
consequences. After varying aspects of the task, the
authors concluded that patients fail to perform advantageously in the task because they are “unresponsive
for future consequences,”8 reflecting “myopia for the
future.”
The SMH shows how a (cognitive) model can contribute to the understanding of a phenomenon of interest. It delivers hypotheses that can be tested and
falsified despite the fact that one experiment was not
enough to provide satisfying evidence. Altogether, the
SMH has, via the IGT, identified some brain regions
involved in decision making under risk. It shows how
emotion-related feedback from the body can guide performance. Nonetheless, it fails to describe how exactly
the interaction between body state, emotion, and decision making is supposed to happen, especially when
the biases guiding behavior are unconscious.21,22

<-----Page 3----->44

The Role of Working Memory, Inhibition,
Motivation, Personality, and Underlying
Neuronal Substrate in Risky Choice
Since its inception, different aspects of the IGT have
been varied and results have been replicated and augmented. Apart from new ideas about mechanisms and
factors other than “myopia for the future” that might
be responsible for the findings, these studies provide
evidence for additional brain regions presumably involved in regulating task performance. This is true not
only for tasks focusing on decision making under risk
but also for a whole range of tasks that are likely to be
influenced by the same factors (e.g., evaluative judgment, risk judgment).
The role of working memory on the IGT was questioned by studies with dual-task methodologies.23,24
Bechara et al.7 dissociated working memory from
decision-making capacities by showing that working
memory did not depend on intact decision making.
Interestingly, decision making was affected by working memory. Performance in the IGT was worse when
patients had working memory problems. A broader
damage to the prefrontal cortices (PFCs), including
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), leads to
impairments in the IGT.7,16 Other authors tested for
different explanations of the impact of working memory in task performance.22,25 New methods to screen
the knowledge people have about the card decks reveal
that a hypothesis about unconscious somatic markers
may not be necessary to explain the behavior in gambles.22 The authors conclude that people know about
the advantageous strategy. Whether they apply this
knowledge to guide their behavior remains another
question.
Other research considers that impaired performance in the IGT may be because of an inability to
inhibit responses or deficits in reversal learning. Studies
investigating the impairments of patients with frontal
lobe damage have found that ventral PFC and OFC
(but not DLPFC) patients show an impaired reversal
learning performance.26–28 If impairments in reversal
learning are responsible for poor performance in the
IGT, we have to add the OFC as a candidate region in
risky decision making.
Deficits in task performance from a lack of motivation or personality influences were investigated. Different patient groups were recruited and their typical
behavioral patterns were analysed (e.g., increased or
decreased betting). Personality changes in participants
with either bilateral VMPFC lesions or with prefrontal
lesions but not bilateral ventromedial involvement and
persons with nonprefrontal lesions were investigated.
The results suggest that diminished emotionality, im-

paired decision making, and psychosocial dysfunction
may be related to ventromedial prefrontal dysfunction
in both prefrontal lesion groups compared to nonprefrontal.29
Sanfey et al.25 investigated patients’ risk preferences
independently from the accuracy of their decisions
in order to detect whether they were risk seeking or
avoiding. They found VMPFC patients to be both risk
seeking and risk avoiding. In comparison, healthy controls, both old and young, were risk averse. Moreover,
the authors could not clearly disentangle any lesion
differences that could contribute to a better understanding of the findings for the patient group. The
risk-taking group only tended to have lesions extending
to the DLPFC. Hence, these studies do not suggest
additional regions of interest nor do they exclude the
VMPFC concerning the role it plays in risky decision
making.

Risky and Informed Decision Making and the
Neuronal Substrate in Healthy Subjects
So far we have discussed conclusions about candidate regions drawn from knowledge about lesion locations in impaired patients. Studies using neuroimaging
also gain evidence from the investigation of healthy
subjects. Hence, we can draw conclusions about the
underlying neural substrate of task aspects. Such studies provide mixed support for the central role of the
VMPFC and OFC. When the decision-making component of a computerized “Iowa Gambling-like-task”
was isolated, decision making, per se, activated OFC,
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial PFC, DLPFC,
insula, inferior parietal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. Guessing (i.e., unlearned task performance occurring within the first task administration) activated
sensory-motor associative areas and the left amygdala.
Informed decision making (learned risk-taking task
performance during a second administration) activated
the hippocampus, posterior cingulate (responsible for
memory processes), striatum, and the cerebellum (regulating motor control).30 Moreover, a study focusing on
the risk anticipation period of the IGT found that during that period the medial frontal gyrus was activated
exclusively. Interestingly, no orbitofrontal regions were
activated.31
We have to bear in mind that especially fMRI data
are likely to be distorted in the frontal brain and
that they are relatively slow measures. Hence, subtle
variations of task aspects in order to tease out even
more specific regional functions might be an aim that
can only be reached with the support of additional
physiological measures (e.g., eye movement parameters, physiological parameters from the pupil, SCR,

<-----Page 4----->45

reaction time measures). Further, even if participants
of these studies were considered “healthy,” this does
not mean that their brains are exactly matching. Variations are conceivable in structure and function. Additionally, personality traits (e.g., sensation seekers versus harm avoiders) and constitution may differ, not
to mention gender differences that could lead to performance discrepancies and hence should at least be
controlled.

The Neural Substrate for Emotional, Social,
and Cognitive Intelligence within Decision
Making under Risk
Sanfey20 sum up the advantages of the SMH in that
it offers a way of integrating emotional influences into a
domain that predominantly would explain behavioral
strategies by traditional views within cognitive psychology. He picks up some critical points regarding existing
studies. According to Sanfey,20 the SMH fails to clearly
indicate how unconscious emotional processes interact
during decision making. The SMH does not offer a way
to explain in detail the emotional processes (e.g., fear,
anger) or the somatic markers triggered by the IGT.
To better disentangle emotional and cognitive processes in decision making, Sanfey et al.25 investigated
performances in another game known as the Ultimatum Game. In this game, two players have to split a
sum of money. One of the participants, the offerer,
proposes a split of the money and the other, the responder, can accept or reject this offer. If the offer
is rejected, neither participant is rewarded. Theories
based on rational choice predict that no offer should
ever be rejected by the responder. However, in all studies employing the game, responders readily reject low
offers.
People reject offers not because they lack knowledge
about how to play the game but rather because they react angrily to an offer perceived as unfair. These studies
provide evidence for the neural basis of decision making under risk, while suggesting an important role for
emotions, besides cognitive processes, in risky decision
making. Unfair offers elicit activity in the DLPFC and
ACC which relate to cognitive processes, but, more
interestingly, they also result in bilateral activity in the
anterior insula, an area related to emotion processing.
Moreover, activation in this emotional state processing
region correlated with subsequent decisions to reject or
accept an offer, showing stronger activation in subjects
that rejected more unfair offers. Hence, the authors
concluded that “neural representations of emotional
states guide human decision-making” and that “models of decision-making cannot afford to ignore emotion

as a vital and dynamic component of our decisions and
choices in the real world.”25
Further evidence that the neural substrate for emotional and social intelligence and cognitive intelligence are different is provided by Bar-On et al.32
They compared patients with average cognitive intelligence and with an emotional intelligence lying below average. The experimental group included three
kinds of patients with lesions in either the ventromedial cortex, the amygdala, or, alternatively, in the insula/somatosensory cortex. Control subjects had lesions in the superior and/or middle frontal gyri in the
right PFC, right precentral gyrus, and/or in the right
paracentral lobule with neither damage below the corpus callosum nor an extension to the frontal pole. In
some subjects, the middle temporal gyrus and the occipital cortex (without insula or somatosensory cortex)
were affected too. Emotional intelligence was measured with the Bar-On EQ-I, which is a self-reported
measure of social and emotional behavior. It provides
an estimate of underlying emotional and social intelligence.33
With the IGT, the researchers investigated the subjects’ ability to “exercise personal judgment in decision making.” Social functioning was employed with
semi-structured interviews as well as rating scales that
provided a “Total Social Scale” score indicating the extent of impairment (see Tranel et al.34 for more details).
Cognitive intelligence, perception, memory, and executive functioning were also assessed and, as intended,
did not differ between the groups. Additionally, no significant correlation was found between cognitive and
emotional intelligence.
Both social functioning and personal judgment in
decision making differed significantly between the
groups. On the one hand, the authors’ assumption
that emotional and social intelligence as well as the
underlying neuronal system differ from cognitive intelligence and its neural substrate is supported. On
the other hand, the results reconfirm the neurological
substrate that mediates somatic state activation and
personal judgment within decision making found in
patient studies. These neural systems seem to overlap with those of social and emotional intelligence.
The authors sum up that
the processes of judgment and decision making depend
on neural systems for: (i) memory, which is supported by
high-order association cortices as well as the dorsolateral sector of the prefrontal cortex; (ii) emotion, which is
mediated by subcortical limbic structures that trigger the
emotional response; and (iii) feelings which are supported
by limbic as well as closely associated regions such as the
insula, surrounding parietal cortices and the cingulate

cortex. (. . .) The VMPFC links these systems together;
(. . .). Impairment of these mechanisms (. . .) can have an
ill effect on one’s ability to effectively cope with daily
demands. Such impairment may include a decrease in
one’s ability to: (. . .) (v) cope flexibly with the immediate
situation, make decisions and solve problems of a personal
and interpersonal nature.32

The studies by Sanfey and Bar-On indicate that
ideas regarding candidate areas can come from all
types of studies that investigate behavior that is based
on a variety of cognitive processes possibly intermingled in the behavior of interest. Examples are studies
exclusively investigating neural networks of emotions
or emotion processing35–37 or studies focusing on task
variations that only trigger cognitive processes. Overall, fMRI does not unambiguously delineate areas responsible solely for one behavior of interest. In other
words, there is no area exclusively active during risk
perception. Connections in the brain are complex, and
hypotheses regarding locations of activity from a specific task have to be discerned with the help of cognitive
models.

Ecological Decision Making
A different origin for neuroscientific approaches related to a concept of risk comes from studies interested
in the neural circuits associated with ecological decision making. Neuroeconomical theories have been developed describing the neuronal substrate of behavior
by integrating normative approaches of emotion and
cognition with decision making. In the quickly growing
field of neuroeconomics, the overall goal is to provide a
better understanding of the cognitive processes of decision making and to draw conclusions for risky behavior
in everyday life.
Most classical economic theories assume that humans are rational decision makers that follow the rules
of probability without being influenced by emotions.
Given this assumption, mathematical models and theories exist that predict and explain decision making.
Such models are the most valuable tools ecologists
have had so far to analyse complex problems. However, these models often fail to consider biases in human decision making. They neglect that people might
use various, rather irrational, strategies (e.g., heuristic
routines) to overcome uncertainties in risky decision
making. As a consequence, the rational economists’
models, providing a normative description of behavior,
were supplemented with psychological and biological
assumptions. The purpose was to account for less rational, more realistic, human behavior and to be able
to draw conclusions and generate hypotheses about behavior by looking at the underlying neural processes.

In the following section, the classical economical
view of peoples’ behavior is introduced and it is shown
how deficits of such models led to the formulation of
PT. After that, the neural implications of neuroeconomic models are discussed.

From a Rational Economic View to the
Development of Prospect Theory
Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician, observed in 1738
that people do not evaluate options by their objective utilities to maximize their expected (net) wealth
but rather by some kind of personal utility system.38
He assumed that within this personal utility system
one chooses the option with the highest expected utility in each possible state, constructing a weighted average. The weights are probability estimates of each
state; hence, the expected utility is an expectation in
terms of probability theory. The Expected Utility Theory, introduced later by Neumann and Morgenstern,39
proved that any normal preference relation over a set
of states can be written as expected utility. It is one of
the most traditional models and it describes decisions
under risk and uncertainty with the help of a utility
function. The function assumes a concave relationship
between wealth and utility. Nevertheless, this model
fails to explain certain paradoxes (e.g., the Ellsberg
paradox, the Allais paradox), and hence the model’s
descriptive value was questioned.40
A new theory introduced by Kahneman and Tversky,41 PT, replaced the term “utility” with “value.” PT
predicts that preferences will depend on how a problem is framed. Value is defined in terms of gains and
losses, i.e., people do not make decisions based on the
absolute level of net wealth. Gains and losses are evaluated relative to some kind of neutral reference point,
which may vary from situation to situation. Moreover,
the value function for losses differs from that for gains
in that it is convex and steeper with its curve lying below the horizontal axis.41 Unlike the Expected Utility
Theory, which concerns itself with how decisions under uncertainty should be made, PT concerns itself with
how decisions are actually made. It is taking into account
some irrational tendencies or asymmetries, reflected
in so-called framing and editing procedures within human choices, by introducing a flexible reference level
for the decision maker.

Neural Implications of Neuroeconomics
and Prospect Theory
In economic models, findings of research focusing on “decision utility,” “expected utility,” and “outcome probability” (OP) can be distinguished. In PT,
decision utility is central. PT attempts to overcome

<-----Page 6----->Vorhold: The Neuronal Substrate of Risky Choice

shortcomings of classical economical models by defining subjective value functions with different assumptions about the curves for gains and losses. The impact of high and low probabilities is characterized by
a weighting function. Additional major components of
PT are the “value function,” which focuses on the neuronal representations of values, the “weighting function,” which focuses on the neural processes involved
in the generation of such a value function, and “representation.” The latter encompasses a presentation
of the neural processes underlying framing effects and
editing operations that help inform behavior.
Decision utility and expected utility predict
neuronal representations from anticipated and
experienced reward and punishment. Results from
neuroimaging studies suggest that different brain
mechanisms in decision making could embody both
forms of utility. Signals related to reward, if experienced or expected, have been found in brain areas,
such as the striatum, DLPFC, OFC, posterior parietal
cortex, supplementary eye field, and ACC and posterior cingulate cortex (for a review see Ref. 42).
Regions involved in decision utility, which is an
estimate or anticipation of experienced utility during decision making, should be recruited during reward anticipation or when a subjective value of future
events is evaluated. The dopaminergic system is a system arising from the midbrain to various cortical and
subcortical areas. The system occupies a modulatory
neurotransmitter, dopamine, which seems to be the
primary substrate for decision utility. Neurons within
this system heighten their firing rate when unexpected
rewards or stimuli that predict future rewards are being processed (see Schultz43 for a review). Candidate
brain areas are the ventral striatum, PFC, and the
amygdala. The ventral striatum is one of the target
regions of the dopaminergic system. It integrates signals coming from PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus,
and it seems to play a crucial role in the representation of anticipated rewards. It increases activity during
an exposure to a riskless stimulus (i.e., in a pure win
situation).44
The PFC may be further divided into the DLPFC
and the VMPFC, which both play a role in decision
making under risk. The importance of the DLPFC
and VMPFC was predominantly shown in the studies
investigating the impaired behavior of lesion patients
playing the IGT. Here, the DLPFC was important for
manipulating and/or maintaining cognitive representations in working memory in order to better plan future behavior. The VMPFC was more associated with
experienced than anticipated reward. However, as patients with lesions in that brain region fail to develop

47

anticipatory SCRs to risky choices, a certain involvement of the VMPFC in the development of anticipatory responses was presumed as well.12
The amygdala is involved in emotion and learning.
It is essential for the production of fear responses and
crucial for the learning of associations between emotional stimuli and behavior (for review see Refs. 35–37).
Again, studies by the Iowa group provide evidence that
the amygdala is required to help build fearful anticipatory SCRs to losses.4
Regions involved in expected utility, which implies that an action has already resulted in a
reward or punishment, should show differential
activation during the experience of positive or negative feedback. Moreover, brain activity possibly varies
depending on the magnitude and valence of the outcome. Studies show activation related to such processes
in the striatum, the OFC, the VMPFC, and in the
amygdala.
The striatum can be divided into its dorsal and ventral parts, and each part receives inputs from different
structures. The ventral striatum is thought to get input
from amygdala, hippocampus, and VMPFC, whereas
the dorsal part of the striatum receives signals from the
dorsal and lateral PFCs. This suggests different roles
for dorsal and lateral areas in risky decision making.
The ventral part, which includes nucleus accumbens
and ventral putamen, is active during reward anticipation and experience. The dorsal part of the striatum,
i.e., caudate nucleus and dorsal putamen, is central in
the processing of experienced reward magnitude and
valence.44–47
The VMPFC shows signal changes during reward
and not so much during loss. Gambling tasks show
that it plays a role in the choice between desirable
stimuli. Patient studies suggest involvement in behavior of executive control rather than in representing
value per se. The ACC seems sensitive to perception
of negative outcomes, which is presumably influenced
by the dopaminergic activity within this region.44 The
amygdala, however, seems to be specifically involved in
the representation of negative outcomes, as previously
shown by Bechara et al.4
In PT, the same brain process could be responsible
for representing the value of gains and losses as the
shape of the value function is assumed to be equal independently of the direction of the actual outcome. So
far, separate systems for the representation of reward
magnitude and the valence of an outcome were mostly
suggested by neuroscientific data (see review by Lee42 ).
There is also evidence that there are brain regions,
like the striatum, that are involved in the processing of
outcome valences as well as reward magnitude.45–47

<-----Page 7----->48

In a situation that offers both potential gains and
losses, PT assumes that the value function is steeper
for losses than for gains, implying risk or loss aversion.
Again, the ventral striatum may play an important role
in signal integration of gain and loss representations. It
has access to representations of positive and negative
outcome values as it receives input from the amygdala,
hippocampus, and PFC. As described in detail above,
it has been shown in studies with patients suffering
from lesions in the amygdala and/or in the VMPFC
that these regions are essential for building up and
“holding/keeping” a risk aversion. Nevertheless, it was
also shown that, with task variations, the deficits are
more or less present in particular patients. The role
of the OFC was discussed as the region important for
learning reward associations, suggesting that this, and
not loss aversion, could be the mechanism responsible
for the deficits found in patients.
The neural representations of OP are mostly described with the help of animal studies (see review by
Trepel et al.44 ). When animals make choices between
stimuli that promise different probable rewards, it was
found that neurons in the lateral intraparietal area increase firing rates with growing probability of a positive
outcome. Moreover, reward probability may also be reflected by the dopaminergic system, which was found
to respond with varying firing rates in dependence of
reward probabilities in human midbrains (regions central for dopamine reception) and monkeys.48,49 Greatest dopaminergic activity was found during the conditions of highest uncertainty. This again speaks for the
assumption that the dopaminergic system codes for the
degree of risk associated with a decision.44
In accord with PT, the most important aspect of OP
is that high probabilities are underweighted while low
probabilities are overweighted. The result is a characteristic curve of a weighting function that stands for an
overall willingness to entertain risk. The shape of the
curve could emerge from diminishing sensitivity and
also from emotional aspects within risky decision making. For example, underweighting high probabilities
might reflect fear and overweighting low probabilities
might reflect hope. Trepel et al.44 hypothesize that fear
could be represented by amygdala activation and hope
would be reflected in activation of the ventral striatum.
Additionally, they hypothesized that an impulsive acceptance of gambles, as found in some patients, would
result in an increase in weighting function elevation.
Hence, the individual differences in the elevation of a
weighting function could be related to differences in
the dopaminergic system as well as the serotonergic (5HT) system, as both have been shown to be associated
with individual levels of impulsivity.

Framing and editing operations are hypothesized
by PT to be responsible for guiding decision making via shaping of representations of the prospects.
In dual-process models of judgment and choice, researchers distinguish between two processing routes
that can influence judgment and decision making. The
one route would be spontaneous, associative, and affective and would, for example, use availability and/or affect heuristics to make choices. The other route would
be rule based, cognitive, and reflected through dominance in choice and/or higher order reasoning in decision making.
Assuming a dual route within PT for the generation of judgment and choice might also contribute to
the understanding of underlying brain areas. Passive
framing and probability weighting may be processes
belonging to the first system, which relies on limbic and
basal ganglia regions. More controlled active framing
and editing operations may reflect changes within the
second system, incorporating regions of the lateral and
dorsomedial PFCs.50
The neural substrate of framing effects becomes evident in studies focusing on reward perception in dependence of the reward context. It was shown that the
ventral striatum and the VMPFC responded to outcomes more when the respective outcome was viewed
as a gain or when it was presented in a gains-only
gamble.45 Editing processes involve controlled reformulations of prospects and hence should recruit memory and executive control processes, thereby relying
on the DLPFC. Moreover, editing requires inhibition
of fast automatic (and hence route one driven) responses, which is known to take place in the right
lateral PFC and with the help of the dopaminergic
system. Studies strengthen this assumption by showing
that patients with lesions in the VMPFC fail to inhibit
responses.
There is growing evidence regarding the neural representation of risky decision making. Models like the
PT try to absorb the losses of pure rational economic
models by introducing more flexible explanations for
risk-seeking or risk-adverse behavior. Nonetheless, further work is needed to disentangle the exact contributions of the different aspects hypothesized by PT that
are shaping the choices. Especially, the framing and
editing effects have to be investigated in some more detail as well as the exact cognitive and affective processes
that lead to the perception of an overall probability
weight. So far, only assumptions or indirect knowledge
gained through animal or patient studies are available.
Moreover, it is unclear how people are thought to behave if the probabilities are unknown, i.e., if they are
making uncertain decisions.

<-----Page 8----->Vorhold: The Neuronal Substrate of Risky Choice

As discussed above, fMRI can only answer these
questions with many subsequent studies. PT may be
too complex a model to allow investigating neural
representation of risky decision making in one fMRI
experiment. Meaningful tasks have to be found that
allow such designs. Those tasks have to be repeated
in a block-wise manner to account for shorter cognitive events than those lasting 2–8 s. Risky decisions are
among such cognitive events. As a consequence, we
need to average the brain signal over many trials. In
such studies, outcome depends on the rate with which
stimuli are presented because a certain amount of one
stimulus type is required to get a sensitive measure
of one condition. If neural activity underlying certain
stimuli is compared, the same should only differ in the
exact matter of interest (as we build differential contrasts for comparisons), i.e., stimuli need to be matched.
Without a control task (i.e., comparing activation to a
resting state), fMRI data are even harder to interpret.
It is probably most challenging to find a suitable
control condition that exclusively differs from the experimental task in one single aspect, i.e., the effect
of interest. Unfortunately, the models to date are not
constructed in that way. They usually describe a phenomenon and not how to control for it in an experiment.

Neuroeconomical Studies Focusing on Social
Decision Making and Evaluative Judgment
Decisions made during social interaction, or when
the outcome depends on the behavior of another person, are different from decisions made in isolation.
Brain areas important in individual decision making
are relevant in interactive decision making, too. Signal changes from interactive decision making in a trust
game were found in the nucleus caudate.51 Here, activation changed systematically depending on whether
the player perceived an opponent’s response as malevolent, neutral, or benevolent. As described in more detail
above,25 the activation in the anterior insula changes
when an opponent’s offer in the Ultimate Game is
perceived as unfair. Brain activation in the anterior insula, ACC, and striatum also changes depending on
whether or not subjects believe they are playing with a
real partner or a computer. This indicates that aspects,
other than reward, can bias decisions.25,52
Other decision-making strategies are learned
through past experiences. People, when recruiting
experiences to generate an evaluation of choice
alternatives in a game, may update their own value
functions or even their beliefs about other players’ behavior.51,53,54 There is little literature providing evidence for the neural substrate of interactive

49

reinforcement learning (in the sense of revising utilities of certain choices of one self and others in order
to perform better). Bhatt55 investigated players’ beliefs
about their own and other players’ beliefs and choices.
Earnings from choices and accurate beliefs correlated
negatively with activity in the insula and positively with
ventral striatum activity. The same brain mechanisms
could also contribute to judging risk, as people can
come to different conclusions about the hazard of a
certain risk resulting from learned experiences and beliefs. So far, there are not many studies investigating
interactive risky decision making.
Evaluative judgment (when the decision maker has
to evaluate alternatives before making a choice) plays
a central role within everyday decision making. However, judgment and decision making depend on the
same neural systems. Evaluative judgment can and
should be investigated separately because judgments,
for example in connection with attitude expression, are
not restricted to decision making.
The neuronal basis for evaluative judgment was
explicitly investigated by Zysset et al.56 They define
judgment as “the assessment of an external or internal stimulus on an internal scale.” Thus, evaluative
judgments represent a special type of judgment. Like
memory retrieval tasks, evaluative judgments also depend on previously acquired knowledge and experienced events and these are closely related to a person’s
value system. Which internal scale an event is related
to is, therefore, self referential.
In the study by Zysset and co-workers,56 the evaluative process was isolated by comparing brain activation
during evaluative judgment with brain activation during episodic and semantic memory retrieval. Anterior
frontomedian cortex, inferior precuneus, and left inferior PFC were found as the underlying substrate for
evaluative judgments. The anterior frontomedian cortex activation reflects metacontrol processes, and the
activation of the inferior precuneus reflects episodic
memory retrieval during evaluative judgments. The
inferior frontal gyrus shows signal increase when people are selecting information among alternatives during an evaluative judgment. Furthermore, the results
suggest a functional interdependence of the anterior
frontomedian and the median parietal cortex, with the
former being more activated by processes incorporating self-referential processes as well as self-initiation
of subsequent cognitive processes. The latter (inferior
precuneus) is thought to be more activated by processes
incorporating episodic retrieval.
That aspects within evaluative judgment, for example if it is performed explicitly or implicitly, involve
different neural networks is highlighted in a study by

<-----Page 9----->50

Cunningham et al.57 The authors found that, dependent on whether the task is explicit or implicit,
different brain regions are important. For example,
right OFC and temporal pole were associated with
emotional intensity only during explicit evaluation.
Inferior frontal/insular cortex activation correlated
significantly with attitude valence not with emotion
intensity. Nevertheless, activity in some areas was
found to be task independent, suggesting some sort
of automatic implicit processing by these areas. Activity in the amygdala correlated with emotional intensity, and activity in the right insula and the ACC
correlated with valence in both tasks. A study by
Vorhold et al.58 provides evidence that, during an explicit risk rating task, the medial PFC, the inferior
frontal gyrus, the cerebellum, and the amygdala are all
activated.
Altogether, it is important to note that evaluative
judgment is, like decision making, not a single process.
It varies, for example, in the degree to which it is implicit (automatic, unconscious) or explicit (controlled,
conscious). As a consequence, different brain mechanisms should also subserve different aspects within an
evaluation judgment like emotional intensity, valence,
memory recruitment, and the self-initiated processes
to change and/or control an initial behavior. Usually,
judgment features are not modelled or defined separately but are rather subsumed under decision-making
properties.
Northoff et al.59 try to disentangle the contributions
of cognitive and affective components within decision
making. Paradigmatically, these components are believed to be reflected in affective judgment consisting
of a reaction to emotional stimulation and an evaluation requiring rational categorizations. Subsequently,
affective judgment may influence decision making. It
was found in healthy subjects that the brain signal
in the VMPFC when performing affective judgments
(with and without a preceding expectancy period) correlated with the subsequent performance in the IGT.
This can be seen as evidence that VMPFC activity
during affective judgment is crucial for beneficial decision making. Maybe the VMPFC holds the key role in
the complex interplay between affective judgment and
successful decision making.
Further, ideas for an explanation of the exact relationship between judgment and decision making are
discussed.59 Judging risk is an ability needed and used
frequently within everyday life. Judgments occur even
without direct decision making. It seems indispensable
to consider the neural substrates for all of the displayed
mechanisms when generating ideas about candidate
regions active in risk perception.

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences

Taken together, theories assuming solely rational behavior cannot account for complex real-life decision
making. It is becoming clearer that affect plays an important role in risky choice.60 Models of emotion-based
choices can help to enrich these rational theories. Joining different ideas, models, or even disciplines together
helps to draw conclusions about underlying neuronal
processes in more complex real-life behavior. Risk perception, risky decision making, and risk judgments are
such complex behaviors. fMRI can contribute to the
understanding of the underlying neuronal substrate of
risky choice. Despite this, some important restrictions
have been outlined above that have to be considered
when using fMRI to interpret these phenomena.
