The Neural Basis of Economic
Decision-Making in the
Ultimatum Game

The nascent ﬁeld of neuroeconomics seeks to ground economic decisionmaking in the biological substrate of the brain. We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging of Ultimatum Game players to investigate neural substrates
of cognitive and emotional processes involved in economic decision-making. In
this game, two players split a sum of money; one player proposes a division and
the other can accept or reject this. We scanned players as they responded to
fair and unfair proposals. Unfair offers elicited activity in brain areas related to
both emotion (anterior insula) and cognition (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex).
Further, signiﬁcantly heightened activity in anterior insula for rejected unfair
offers suggests an important role for emotions in decision-making.

Standard economic models of human decisionmaking (such as utility theory) have typically
minimized or ignored the influence of emotions
on people’s decision-making behavior, idealizing the decision-maker as a perfectly rational
cognitive machine. However, in recent years
this assumption has been challenged by behavioral economists, who have identified additional
psychological and emotional factors that influence decision-making (1, 2), and recently researchers have begun using neuroimaging to
examine behavior in economic games (3). This
study applies functional neuroimaging techniques to investigate the relative contributions of
cognitive and emotional processes to human
social decision-making.
The limitations of the standard economic
model are effectively illustrated by empirical
findings from a simple game known as the

Ultimatum Game. In the Ultimatum Game, two
players are given the opportunity to split a sum
of money. One player is deemed the proposer
and the other, the responder. The proposer
makes an offer as to how this money should be
split between the two. The second player (the
responder) can either accept or reject this offer.
If it is accepted, the money is split as proposed,
but if the responder rejects the offer, then neither
player receives anything. In either event, the
game is over.
The standard economic solution to the Ultimatum Game is for the proposer to offer the
smallest sum of money possible to the responder and for the responder to accept this offer,
on the reasonable grounds that any monetary
amount is preferable to none. However, considerable behavioral research in industrialized cultures indicates that, irrespective of the monetary
sum, modal offers are typically around 50% of
the total amount. Low offers (around 20% of
the total) have about a 50% chance of being
rejected (4–8). This latter, quite robust, experimental finding is particularly intriguing, demonstrating that circumstances exist in which
people are motivated to actively turn down
monetary reward.

ide–sensitive factor) (33–35) or AP2 (36) may
be required for export of functional heteromeric
receptor complexes and/or stabilization of these
complexes at the cell surface.
Our results suggest that phosphorylation
of GluR2 Ser880 is necessary for LTD induction. In Purkinje cells transfected with GluR2
K882A, which presumably contain at least
some GluR2 K882A/GluR3 and/or GluR2
K882A/GluR4c heteromeric receptor complexes, the presence of a PKC consensus site
on subunits other than GluR2 appears to be
insufficient to enable LTD. It is unknown
whether the corresponding serines on GluR3
and GluR4c are indeed phosphorylated by
PKC or if upstream sequence differences and
differential protein binding render these subunits incapable of supporting LTD.
Previous attempts to test the involvement
of cerebellar LTD in motor learning paradigms have relied on drugs or genetic manipulations that act early in the LTD induction
signaling cascade, either at receptors or second messengers (1). These studies have been
limited owing to the nonspecific nature of the
manipulations (e.g., disruption of mGluR1 or
PKC function). A GluR2 K882A knock-in
mouse could provide the first strong test of
the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD is required
for certain forms of motor learning.

Why do people do this? The game is so
simple that it is improbable that these rejections are due to a failure to understand the
rules of the game, or an inability to conceptualize a single-shot interaction with a partner (9). On the basis of participant reports, it
appears that low offers are often rejected
after an angry reaction to an offer perceived
as unfair (10). Objecting to unfairness has
been proposed as a fundamental adaptive
mechanism by which we assert and maintain a
social reputation (11), and the negative emotions provoked by unfair treatment in the Ultimatum Game can lead people to sacrifice
sometimes considerable financial gain in order
to punish their partner for the slight. Unfair
offers in the Ultimatum Game induce conflict
in the responder between cognitive (“accept”)
and emotional (“reject”) motives, motives that
we might expect to see represented in brain
areas implicated in cognitive and emotional
modes of thought, with additional regions possibly mediating these competing goals (12).
To shed light on the neural and psychological processes mediating such behaviors, we
scanned 19 participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), each in the
role of the responder in the Ultimatum Game.
We were interested in neural and behavioral
reactions to offers which were fair (the money
is split 50:50) or unfair (the proposer offered an
unequal split to his or her advantage). In particular, we hypothesized that unfair offers
would engage neural structures involved in
both emotional and cognitive processing, and
that the magnitude of activation in these structures might explain variance in the subsequent
decision to accept or reject these offers.
Before scanning, each participant was introduced to 10 people they were told would partner
with them in the games to follow. They were told
that they would play a single iteration of the
game with each partner and that their decisions
with each partner would not be revealed to the
other partners and, therefore, could not affect
subsequent offers. The participants were then
placed inside the MRI scanner and began playing the Ultimatum Game with their partners via

and two $9:$1 offers from both human and computer partners (20
offers in total).

a computer interface (Fig. 1A) (13). They completed 30 rounds in all, 10 playing the game with
a human partner (once with each of the 10
partners), 10 with a computer partner, and a
further 10 control rounds in which they simply
received money for a button press. The rounds
were presented randomly, and all involved splitting $10. Offers made by human partners in fact
adhered to a predetermined algorithm, which
ensured that all participants saw the same set
(and a full range) of offers (14, 15). Half of these
offers were fair, that is, a proposal to split the
$10 evenly ($5:$5), with the remaining half proposing unequal splits (two offers of $9:$1, two
offers of $8:$2, and one offer of $7:$3). The 10
offers from the computer partner were identical
to those from the human partners (half fair, half
unfair). The 10 control trials were designed to
control for the response to monetary reinforcement, independent of the social interaction. The
distribution of offers generally mimics the range
of offers typically made in uncontrolled versions of the game (i.e., involving freely acting
human partners).
Behavioral results were very similar to
those typically found in Ultimatum Game
experiments (Fig. 1B) (16). Participants accepted all fair offers, with decreasing acceptance rates as the offers became less fair.
Unfair offers of $2 and $1 made by human
partners were rejected at a significantly higher rate than those offers made by a computer
($9:$1 offer: ␹2 ⫽ 5.28, 1 df, P ⫽ 0.02; $8:$2
offer: ␹2 ⫽ 8.77, 1 df, P ⫽ 0.003), suggesting
that participants had a stronger emotional
reaction to unfair offers from humans than to
the same offers from a computer (17).
Among the areas showing greater activation
for unfair compared with fair offers from human
partners (Fig. 2, A and B; table S1) were bilateral
anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
The magnitude of activation was also significantly greater for unfair offers from human partners as compared to both unfair offers from
computer partners (left insula: t ⫽ 2.52, P ⬍
0.02; right insula: t ⫽ 2.2, P ⬍ 0.03) and low
control offers (left insula: t ⫽ 3.46, P ⬍0.001;

right insula: t ⫽ 2.83, P ⬍ 0.05). This suggests
that these activations were not solely a function
of the amount of money offered to the participant
but rather were also uniquely sensitive to the
context, namely perceived unfair treatment from
another human (Fig. 2, C and D). Further, regions of bilateral anterior insula demonstrated
sensitivity to the degree of unfairness of an offer,
exhibiting significantly greater activation for a
$9:$1 offer than an $8:$2 offer from a human
partner (Fig. 2E) (left insula, P ⬍ 0.001; right
insula, P ⬍ 0.01), in addition to the aforementioned greater activation for unfair offers than
fair ($5:$5) offers.
Activation of bilateral anterior insula to unfair offers from human partners is particularly
interesting in light of this region’s oft-noted
association with negative emotional states. Anterior insula activation is consistently seen in
neuroimaging studies of pain and distress (18–
20), hunger and thirst (21, 22), and autonomic
arousal (23). This region has also been implicated in studies of emotion, in particular involvement in the evaluation and representation of
specific negative emotional states (24). Chief
amongst these are anger and disgust, both of
which have been found to engage a distinct
region of the anterior insula activated by an
unfair offer in the present study (25, 26).
Though studies of disgust have largely focused
on physical sensations of taste and odor (27), it
has been suggested that emotion-based disgust
(as perhaps induced by an insultingly unfair
offer) may be conceptually similar. The recruitment of similar neural structures, namely the
anterior insula, in both physical and moral disgust gives some credence to this notion.
If the activation in the anterior insula is a
reflection of the responders’ negative emotional
response to an unfair offer, we might expect
activity in this region to correlate with the subsequent decision to accept or reject the offer.
Because all fair offers and the vast majority of
$7:$3 offers were accepted, we focused on the
$8:$2 and $9:$1 offers from a human partner for
the analysis of whether neural activity was related to the decision made in the game. Indeed,
looking at the participant level, those partici-

which they indicated whether

pants with stronger anterior insula activation to
unfair offers rejected a higher proportion of
these offers (right insula: correlation coefficient
r ⫽ –0.45, P ⫽ 0.025, one-tailed; left insula:
r ⫽ –0.39, P ⫽ 0.05, one-tailed) (Fig. 3A). Of
particular interest is whether these differences in
anterior insular activation extend to the trial
level. Looking across participants, an examination of individual trials also revealed a relation
between right anterior insular activity and the
decision to accept or reject (Fig. 3B). Activation
in this area was significantly greater in response
to unfair offers that were later rejected (P ⫽
0.028, one-tailed). These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that neural
representations of emotional states guide human
decision-making.
In contrast to the insula, DLPFC usually has
been linked to cognitive processes such as goal
maintenance and executive control (28, 29).
Thus, the DLPFC activation we observed in
response to unfair offers may relate to the representation and active maintenance of the cognitive demands of the task, namely the goal of
accumulating as much money as possible. An
unfair offer is more difficult to accept, as indicated by the higher rejection rates of these offers,
and hence higher cognitive demands may be
placed on the participant in order to overcome
the strong emotional tendency to reject the offer.
Although DLPFC activated to unfair offers, this
activation did not correlate with acceptance rates
(r ⫽ 0.04, P ⬎ 0.05), suggesting that activation
of this region alone is not sufficient to predict
behavior. However, motivated by the hypothesis

that this region may be competing with emotional areas in influencing the decision, we examined
the balance between activation in anterior insula
and DLPFC for unfair offers. Unfair offers that
are subsequently rejected have greater anterior
insula than DLPFC activation, whereas accepted
offers exhibit greater DLPFC than anterior insula
(Fig. 3B). The contrast in activation between
these two areas is significantly different for accepted and rejected offers (P ⫽ 0.033, onetailed), consistent with the hypothesis that competition between these two regions influences
behavior. DLPFC activity remains relatively
constant across unfair offers, perhaps reflecting
the steady task representation of money maximization, with anterior insula scaling monotonically to the degree of unfairness, reflecting the
emotional response to the offer. Caution is needed when comparing the magnitude of the fMRI
signal across brain regions. However, it is interesting to note that the outcome of the decision
may reflect the relative engagement of these
regions, with greater anterior insula activation
biasing toward rejection and greater DLPFC biasing toward acceptance. Finally, unfair offers
were also associated with increased activity in
ACC. ACC has been implicated in detection of
cognitive conflict (30, 31), and activation here
may reflect the conflict between cognitive and
emotional motivations in the Ultimatum Game.
This study sought to identify the neural correlates of fairness and unfairness, and in particular the relative contributions of cognitive and
emotional processes to human decision-making.
A basic sense of fairness and unfairness is es-

<-----Page 4----->the idea that the areas of anterior insula and
DLPFC represent the twin demands of the Ultimatum Game task, the emotional goal of resisting unfairness and the cognitive goal of accumulating money, respectively. Further, our finding
that activity in a region well known for its involvement in negative emotion is predictive of
subsequent behavior supports the importance of
emotional influences in human decision-making.
We believe that these findings, and work that
proceeds from them, will provide a more detailed characterization of specific emotional responses, their neural substrates, and the social
circumstances under which they are elicited.
Therefore, not only do our results provide direct
empirical support for economic models that acknowledge the influence of emotional factors on
decision-making behavior, but they also provide
the first step toward the development of quantitative measures that may be useful in constraining the social utility function in economic models (32, 33). Models of decision-making cannot
afford to ignore emotion as a vital and dynamic
component of our decisions and choices in the
real world.

12. We use the term “cognitive” here, in place of the term
“rational” (as commonly used in the traditional economic literature), in recognition of the fact that emotional
responses may also have a rational basis (e.g., to punish
unfair offers). The term “cognitive” is perhaps also problematic, for similar reasons. Terms such as “proximal”
and “distal” may be more accurate, respectively indicating the immediate and longer-term sources of gain
associated with the behavior. However, until the ﬁeld
converges on a new set of accepted terms for designating these classes of motivation, we use the terms cognitive and emotional as intuitively accessible, if not
technically accurate.

14. This methodology deviates somewhat from the standards
of experimental economics, a ﬁeld that generally proscribes the use of deception [see (34) for a summary of
the issues, though there are some exceptions (35)]. We
chose to use a limited amount of deception in the current
study primarily because of the heavy logistic demands of
an fMRI study, requiring a full distribution of offers in a
constrained number of participants. Practical issues notwithstanding, we believe the use of deception had little if
any impact on our results, and any effect was not likely to
confound their interpretation. During the post-experiment debrieﬁng, no subject gave any suggestion that

1758

they had been suspicious of the offers they received.
Further, the behavioral results in the human partner
condition replicate those found in versions of the game
using no deception, with approximately half of offers of
20% or less of the total being rejected (9). Perhaps most
importantly, if subjects suspected deception, this should
have diminished emotional responses (i.e., if subjects
suspected the offers to be ﬁctitious, their emotional
reactions to these offers, particularly unfair offers, should
have been muted). The fact that we observed signiﬁcant
effects consistent with emotional responses suggests,
once again, that the effects of deception were minimal
and, if they were present, have simply caused an underestimate of the observed effects. Although we are sensitive to the issue of deception, we believe that the methodological constraints of fMRI justiﬁed our practice and
that the ﬁndings do not appear to be tainted by subjects’
possible perceptions of the deception used.
15. A common concern regarding the use of deception
involves possible contamination of the participant pool.
As mentioned previously, rejection rates in the current
study replicate those typically reported from uncontrolled Ultimatum Game studies; therefore, we do not
believe we suffered unduly from this. Furthermore, a
comparison of rejection rates over the course of the
experiment (i.e., longitudinally over participants) indicates no systematic trends in these rates (mean rejection rate of offers for ﬁrst six participants was 32%;
mean rate for last six participants was 35%).
16. After the conclusion of the Ultimatum Game with all
partners, subjects then played a single round of the
Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game with each of the partners.
This raises the possibility that subjects did not treat the
Ultimatum Game as a true single-shot game. We do not
believe playing the PD game affected their play in the
Ultimatum Game in this study for several reasons. First,
our behavioral results support the notion that the Ultimatum Game was played as a single-shot game. As noted
above, the proportion of rejected offers in our study
matches proportions reported in the experimental economic literature when the game is strictly controlled as
single-shot. We would have expected much higher rejection rates in an iterated Ultimatum Game. Second, unpublished data of ours using a single-shot Ultimatum

suggests that subjects treated the Ultimatum Game as a
single-shot game, as instructed.
We asked our participants as part of the debrieﬁng
process what they considered a “fair” offer to be
irrespective of their decision to accept or reject, thus
providing an indication of their standards of fairness.
Of our participants, 58% considered any offer less
than $5:$5 as unfair, with the remaining 42% deeming anything less than $7:$3 to be an unfair division.

V1 Neurons Signal Acquisition of
an Internal Representation of
Stimulus Location

A fundamental aspect of visuomotor behavior is deciding where to look or move
next. Under certain conditions, the brain constructs an internal representation
of stimulus location on the basis of previous knowledge and uses it to move
the eyes or to make other movements. Neuronal responses in primary visual
cortex were modulated when such an internal representation was acquired:
Responses to a stimulus were affected progressively by sequential presentation
of the stimulus at one location but not when the location was varied randomly.
Responses of individual neurons were spatially tuned for gaze direction and
tracked the Bayesian probability of stimulus appearance. We propose that the
representation arises in a distributed cortical network and is associated with
systematic changes in response selectivity and dynamics at the earliest stages
of cortical visual processing.
To assess whether monkeys (Macaca mulatta) form an internal representation of stimulus location, we devised a task in which

information about future stimulus locations
could be acquired progressively with successive trials in one experimental condition but
