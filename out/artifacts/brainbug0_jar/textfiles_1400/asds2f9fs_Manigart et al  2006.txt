Financial theory, access to deal flow, selection, and monitoring skills are used to explain
syndication in venture capital firms in six European countries. In contrast with U.S. findings,
portfolio management motives are more important for syndication than individual deal
management motives. Risk sharing, portfolio diversification, and access to larger deals are
more important than selection and monitoring of deals. This holds for later stage and for
early stage investors. Value adding is a stronger motive for syndication for early stage
investors than for later stage investors, however. Nonlead investors join syndicates for the
selection and value-adding skills of the syndicate partners.

Introduction
Venture capital (VC) firms invest in companies that have high growth potential. They
have developed various strategies to deal with this high-risk environment, one of which is
the syndication of investments (Wright & Robbie, 1998). An equity syndicate involves
two or more VC firms taking an equity stake in an investment for a joint payoff (Wilson,
1968), either in the same investment round or, more broadly defined, at different points in
time (Brander, Amit, & Antweiler, 2002).
Syndication is common in the VC industry, both in North America and in Europe. The
statistics of the European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) (2002) show that almost
30% of the value invested by European VCs and of the number of deals were syndicated
in 2001. Despite its importance in the VC sector, surprisingly little is known about the
motives for syndication. VC firms will only invest if they believe the potential return
adequately compensates for the investment risk. Why, then, do VC firms give up potential
return by not investing the whole amount needed by the portfolio company, but rather seek
another VC firm to coinvest and thereby share in the potential gains (or losses)? This

<-----Page 1----->question is compounded by the fact that syndicate arrangements are subject to agency
conflicts and, hence, agency costs (Fried & Hisrich, 1995; Wright & Lockett, 2003). What
are the perceived benefits that compensate for the costs involved in syndication?
The literature on VC syndication discusses several motives as to why VC firms
syndicate their deals. These motives can be classified as dealing either with issues at the
level of the management of the overall fund or with issues related to the management of
a specific investment. From a portfolio management perspective and following traditional
finance theory, VC firms may syndicate to obtain a well-diversified portfolio, thereby
reducing the unsystematic risk of the portfolio (Bygrave, 1987, 1988; Lockett & Wright,
2001). Another rationale for syndication that addresses issues at the level of the portfolio
of the fund is “window dressing” (Lerner, 1994). By syndicating, VC firms are able to
limit underperformance with their peers. Alternatively, VC firms try to be associated with
other successful VC firms so as to increase the chance of raising new funds successfully.
Syndication may further be a means to reduce the uncertainty with regard to good
economic opportunities for investing in the future. By syndicating a deal, VC firms expect
other partner VC firms to reciprocate the gesture in the future (Lockett & Wright, 2001),
thereby securing improved access to more and/or better quality deals (Seppä &
Jääskeläinen, 2002; Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). Moreover, the expectation of reciprocity
reduces the incentives to behave opportunistically and hence, trust between syndicating
partners may be enhanced (Wright & Lockett, 2003; Zucker, 1986).
Additionally, syndication may address different activities in the VC investment cycle
that deal with specific investments in the portfolio of the VC fund. First, syndication may
improve the selection process through improved screening, due diligence, and decision
making (Brander et al., 2002; Lerner, 1994). Second, by syndicating, investors are able to
share their specific knowledge and complementary skills, and as a result, add more value
to the portfolio company (Brander et al.; Bygrave, 1987). Third, syndication may be the
result of a fixed-fraction equity contract at a second-round investment stage that helps
resolve potential agency conflicts between the entrepreneur and inside investors on the one
hand, and inside investors and new outside investors on the other hand (Admati &
Pfleiderer, 1994; Lerner, 1994). Fourth, syndication may lead to collusion and hence,
investors, through cooperation, may increase their negotiating power toward the entrepreneur and, as a result, get better financing terms (Brander et al.). Finally, at exit, and more
specifically at IPO, syndication may lead to enhanced certification and lower underpricing
of the portfolio company (Chowdry & Nanda, 1996; Stuart, Hoang, & Hybels, 1999).
In this article, we compare the relative importance of syndication motives across
different types of venture capitalists. Specifically, we look at two ways in which syndication may improve portfolio management, namely, by increasing deal flow and spreading
risk (finance motive). We contrast these with two ways in which syndication may improve
the VC investment process, namely, by improving deal selection and postinvestment value
addition. The characteristics of venture capitalists that we focus on are investment stage,
size, industry specialization, and experience as lead and nonlead syndicate members. We
empirically test these ideas by using a questionnaire-based methodology since the motives
for syndication are multidimensional.
There is growing attention to the differences between VC markets in different countries (Black & Gilson, 1998; Jeng & Wells, 2000). This study furthers our knowledge of
VC syndication practices in different European countries. After the U.K.-based Lockett
and Wright (2001) study, this is the second study on VC syndication practices outside
North America and the first to encompass multicountry data. Other international studies
have shown that VC practices in North America are not necessarily replicated outside that
region due to economic, legal, institutional, and cultural differences (Kaplan, Martel, &
132

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->Stromberg, 2003; Manigart et al., 2002; Sapienza, Manigart, & Vermeir, 1996). Gaining
a deeper understanding of the syndication motives in European VC markets, where legal
and cultural boundaries may hamper cross-border syndication, may yield insights that are
relevant for other regions of the world.
The article is structured as follows. In the next section, the theoretical perspectives on
syndication and hypotheses are developed. Thereafter, the research setting and the
methods used to test the hypotheses are outlined, and the results are presented. The final
section discusses implications for researchers and practitioners.

Motives for Syndicating VC Investments
This study looks at two ways in which a VC firm can use syndication as a means to
improve the management of its overall portfolio, namely, a financial motive (risk spreading) and securing access to future deal flow, and two ways in which syndication can
improve the management of individual portfolio companies, namely, (1) preinvestment
screening and (2) postinvestment monitoring and value adding. In the remainder of this
section, we develop hypotheses as to why a particular motive for syndication may be more
important for some VC firms than for others.

The Finance Motive
The traditional finance perspective shows that by constructing a well-diversified
portfolio, risk can be reduced without reducing expected return. By spreading investments
across a greater number of investments that do not covary, syndication has the potential to
reduce risk considerably (Markowitz, 1952). This means that the variation in returns is
reduced without reducing the expected return of the portfolio. A fully diversified portfolio
is, however, more difficult to obtain for VC firms compared with institutional investors
who invest in listed stock because of the capital constraints due to the relatively small size
of a VC firm or fund (Sahlman, 1990; Wright & Robbie, 1998). If the VC firm is too small
relative to the project size, syndicating the deal may well be the only way to invest in that
particular deal without unbalancing the VC portfolio. Moreover, syndication gives the VC
firm the opportunity to invest in a larger number of portfolio companies than it could do
without syndication, thereby increasing diversification and reducing the overall risk of the
fund. For example, Cumming (2006) has empirically shown that the number of portfolio
companies in Canadian VC funds increases when they actively syndicate, all other things
being equal, while Zacharakis (2002) has shown that there is less syndication in riskier
U.S. early stage deals than in less risky but larger expansion stage deals. The latter is
explained by the smaller size of early stage deals, giving early stage investors the
opportunity to limit the concentration of their portfolio even without syndication.
A second finance-related motive for syndication is related to the illiquidity of VC
investments (Lockett & Wright, 2001). Minimum investment periods make equity illiquid
in the short to medium term. As a result, equity cannot be continuously traded, unlike
shares listed on the stock market. Due to ex-ante informational asymmetry, the real risk of
the investment may only be fully revealed once the investment has been made. If the risk
associated with the investment turns out to be higher than anticipated, it may be difficult
to adjust the portfolio by divesting because of the illiquid nature of the VC market.
Syndication, therefore, provides a means of sharing risk on a deal-by-deal basis that may
help to reduce overall portfolio risk. Brander et al. (2002) have shown that the volatility
March, 2006

<-----Page 3----->of the performance of Canadian syndicated investments is larger than that of stand-alone
investments, implying that syndicated investments are riskier.
It is unlikely, however, that the finance motive is equally important for all VCs. It is
anticipated that the importance of ex-ante information asymmetry and illiquidity of the
investments are stronger for early stage VC firms than for later stage VC firms. Berger and
Udell (1998) argue that startup firms are more informationally opaque. Due to informational asymmetries, VC firms ascribe a higher standard deviation to returns of early stage
investments. As a result, early stage VC firms need more investments so as to reduce the
unsystematic risk of the portfolio compared with later stage companies. We can expect,
therefore, that the finance motive will be more important for early stage compared with
later stage VC firms. Moreover, it is well known that early stage investments have a longer
time to exit than later stage investments (Cumming & MacIntosh, 2001). Early stage
investments are thus inherently more illiquid compared with later stage investments. The
above information asymmetry and illiquidity arguments lead us to derive the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1a: The finance motive is more important for early stage VC firms than
for later stage VC firms.
Syndication may be driven by the desire to spread financial risk across different
parties (Bygrave, 1987, 1988). The diversification argument is directly linked to the size
of a VC firm. Syndication gives a VC firm the opportunity to invest in a larger number of
portfolio companies than it could without syndication (Cumming, 2006), thereby increasing diversification and reducing the overall risk of the firm. All other things being equal,
a smaller firm benefits more from syndication than a larger firm under the finance
perspective, as this decreases the level of concentration in its portfolio (Zacharakis, 2002).
Moreover, if a VC firm is not large enough relative to a particular project, syndicating the
deal may well be the only way to invest in that opportunity. Hence, following traditional
corporate finance arguments
Hypothesis 1b: The finance motive is more important for small VC firms than for
large VC firms.

Access to Deal Flow
There is a second motive to syndicate from a portfolio management point of view,
namely, to increase the quantity and quality of deal flow (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). It is
important for VC firms to have access to as many high-quality opportunities as possible
in order to select the very best ones. Having a strong syndication network increases the
status and visibility of a VC firm (Lerner, 1994), increasing its likelihood of being invited
into a syndicate network. By syndicating out deals, a VC firm may create an expectation
for reciprocation in the future. If so, the VC firm may be invited to join other syndicates
as a nonlead in the future, and deal flow is increased. The reciprocation of syndicated deals
between VC firms means that deal flow can be maintained even when an individual VC
firm may not be the originator of the deal (Bovaird, 1990).
There are again reasons to believe that the deal flow motive is not equally important
for all VC firms. Larger VC firms need to invest in more deals than small VC firms, all
other things being equal. It is therefore more challenging for them to maintain a good
quantity (and quality) of investment opportunities. The deal flow motive is thus likely to
be more important for large VC firms than for small VC firms. In particular, large firms
seek to increase the quantity of their deal flow through syndication. Hence,
134

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->Hypothesis 2a: The deal flow motive is more important for large VC firms than for
small VC firms.
The likelihood that a VC firm will invest in a new venture declines sharply with
geographic distance and industry dissimilarity, i.e., “the level of dissimilarity between the
VC firm’s previous investment experiences and the industry classification of a given target
company” (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001, p. 1548). Opportunities to interact and, thus, to
exchange information, are more frequent among individuals and firms in the same geographic area or in related industries. This suggests that VC firms are not likely to identify
interesting investment opportunities that lie outside their natural investment area. Syndication may be a powerful way to extend the geographic and industrial investment scope of
VC firms. Sorenson and Stuart (2001) have shown that the probability that a VC firm
invests in a distant or in a dissimilar company increases if there is a syndicate partner with
whom it has previously coinvested, and if that syndicate partner is located near the target
company. A dense interfirm network may be created through frequently syndicating
investments. The network may be viewed as a repository of information that facilitates the
dissemination of information across geographic and industry boundaries. In this way, a
VC firm increases its investment opportunities in areas it would find difficult to access
otherwise. The deal flow motive is therefore more important for VC firms with a broad
investment scope that spans geographic and industry boundaries. The likelihood, however,
that they will come across interesting opportunities that lie far outside their normal
industry or geographic focus is rather small. Specialized VC firms restrict their investments to a small geographic or industry space. This reduces their need to syndicate from
a deal flow perspective. Hence,
Hypothesis 2b: The deal flow motive is less important for specialized VC firms than
for nonspecialized VC firms.

The Deal Selection Motive
VC firms may syndicate in order to reduce company-specific risk both ex ante and
ex post. Ex-ante decision making relates to the selection of investments, whereas ex-post
decision making relates to the subsequent management of the investment. Syndicating
with the same partners builds trust in their investment appraisal, monitoring, and valueadding capabilities, thereby reducing the need for the VC firm to actively do so (Sorenson
& Stuart, 2001; Wright & Lockett, 2003).
Syndication may be a way to better assess the information provided by potential
portfolio companies (Lerner, 1994). The potential for adverse selection may therefore be
reduced by syndicating at the deal selection stage, as syndication allows VC firms to
obtain better information when evaluating risky investment decisions. From an information processing perspective, different decision makers can increase their information
processing capacity to reduce uncertainty (Sah & Stiglitz, 1986).
Bygrave (1987, 1988) shows that syndication is a function of the need to share
information. If VC firms syndicate in order to reduce the ex-ante risk, the selection motive
will be especially important for projects where an informed second opinion is valuable.
This is supported by Lerner (1994), who found evidence that established VC firms
syndicate with one another in first-round investments, and they syndicate with less
established organizations in later rounds. In cases where VC managers cannot decide
outright to accept (high-quality projects) or reject (low-quality projects) an investment
proposal, information received from syndicate partners may help to reach a better decision
March, 2006

135

<-----Page 5----->(Brander et al., 2002). Bygrave (1988) shows that uncertainty and willingness to syndicate
are positively related. Given that uncertainty and information asymmetry are larger for
early stage opportunities than for later stage opportunities, it is likely that the selection
motive will be more important for early stage VC firms than for later stage VC firms.
Hence,
Hypothesis 3a: The selection motive is more important for early stage VC firms than
for later stage VC firms.
Furthermore, it is expected that the selection motive will be less important for firms
that primarily act as lead investors compared with firms that have more deals as nonleads.
The lead investor may have its own particular skills for selecting and monitoring a specific
investment (Wright & Lockett, 2003). When syndicating out a deal as a lead investor, the
VC firm signals to syndicate partners that it backs the deal with its reputation. This is
important as the lead firm, in the vast majority of cases, has the largest (or joint largest)
equity stake in the syndicate (Lockett & Wright, 2001). However, the VC firm that invests
in a deal as a nonlead investor may largely rely on the reputation and the selection skills
of the lead. Hence,
Hypothesis 3b: The more a VC firm acts as a nonlead investor, the more important
the selection motive is.
VC firms, specialized in a specific industry sector, have a deeper understanding of that
sector and therefore experience lower informational asymmetries to evaluate opportunities. Given greater in-house knowledge on their target sectors, VC firms that are specialized in a specific sector have a lower need to rely on syndicate partners for selection
purposes. The same is true for VC firms, focusing on a smaller geographic region.
Geographic distance between a target company and an investor is still a barrier to effect
thorough due diligence and to overcome information asymmetries. Reliance on syndicate
partners close to the target can help to overcome informational asymmetries (Sorenson &
Stuart, 2001). The logic of this argument is that VC firms, specialized in a specific industry
or geographic area, have a lower need to syndicate for selection purposes than nonspecialized VC firms.
Hypothesis 3c: The selection motive is less important for specialized VC firms than
for nonspecialized VC firms.

The Value-Adding Motive
Apart from selection skills, specialized resources may be required for the ex-post
management (monitoring and value adding) of investments (Bruining & Wright, 2002;
Sapienza et al., 1996). This need for specialist expertise in the ex-post management of
portfolio companies can be met by the VC firm’s own resource base, by outside industry
specialists, or by syndicate partners (Brander et al., 2002). Brander et al. found that
Canadian-syndicated VC deals have higher rates of return than stand-alone projects,
and argue that the need to access specific resources for the ex-post management of
investments, rather than for the selection of investments, is a more important driver of
syndication.
There are arguments that early stage VC firms put more emphasis on the value-adding
motive than later stage VC firms. VC firms add value when they are able to reduce critical
uncertainties for the venture (Sapienza et al., 1996). Given the uncertainties in early stage
ventures, VC firms are able to add greatest value to early stage ventures (Bygrave &
136

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Timmons, 1992; Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Sapienza, 1992; Sapienza et al.). All other
things being equal, the value-adding motive is therefore be more important for VC firms
investing in early stage ventures, as these firms provide more hands-on management and
monitoring skills to their portfolio companies than later stage investors. Hence,
Hypothesis 4a: The value-adding motive is more important for early stage VC firms
than for later stage VC firms.
Wright and Lockett (2003) argue that lead investors are more actively involved in the
management of their investee companies. Given that the reputation and the standing of the
lead investor is at stake when syndicating out a deal, a VC firm only takes the lead in a
syndicate if it feels reasonably confident that it has the resources and ability to manage
the investment. When a VC firm joins a syndicate as a nonlead, however, that firm will
normally have a more passive role, relying on the lead investor for managing the relation
with the portfolio company (Wright & Lockett, 2003). Consistent with hypothesis 3b, it is
expected that the value-adding motive is a more important driver to syndicate for nonlead
investors compared with lead investors. Hence,
Hypothesis 4b: The more a VC firm acts as nonlead investor, the more important the
value-adding motive is.
Consistent with the argument that specialized VC firms rely less on syndicate partners
for screening purposes, we hypothesize that specialized VC firms also rely less on
syndicate partners to manage the deal after the investment. VC managers need specific
skills and abilities in order to add value to their portfolio companies, and the more
industry-specific knowledge they have, the better their value-adding capabilities are
(Sapienza et al., 1996). Sapienza et al. have further shown that VC managers spend less
time with geographically distant ventures, although their perceived added value does not
decrease with distance. We hypothesize that VC firms with a broad sector or geographic
scope rely more on syndicate partners to add value and monitor their investments ex post
than VC firms that invest in a narrow range of opportunities.
Hypothesis 4c: The value-adding motive is less important for specialized VC firms
than for nonspecialized VC firms.

Research Setting and Method
Research Setting and Sample
In order to test our hypotheses, VC syndication practices are studied in six European
countries: Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.
Our sample thus includes countries in different parts of Europe where the VC industry is
long established and industry practices have matured. In the countries included in this
study, syndication is most common in Belgium in terms of amounts invested through
syndicates (53.9%) (see Table 1). However, the highest proportions of syndicated deals
are found in France and Sweden (both 39.9%). In Sweden, the amount syndicated (8.2%)
is remarkably lower than the number of deals syndicated (39.9%). Syndication practices
in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are low both in terms of amount invested as
well as the number of deals, with there having been continual decreases in syndication
activity throughout the 1990s (Lockett & Wright, 2001). Syndication activity in Germany
is in-between.

In order to understand why VC firms syndicate, a questionnaire was initially designed
and pretested with U.K. VC managers, advisors, and academics (Lockett & Wright, 2001).
Most studies to date use outcome-based methods (e.g., Brander et al., 2002; Bygrave,
1987, 1988; Lerner, 1994). A specific behavior of VC firms with respect to syndication is
observed, and researchers speculate on the underlying motives that may lead to that
behavior. By using a questionnaire-based method, we directly asked VC managers the
motives for syndicating their deals. We expect, therefore, to get a more profound and
subtle insight in some of the reasons for syndication compared with outcome-based
studies. As the different theoretical perspectives on syndication were anticipated to be
multidimensional, it was deemed necessary to ask respondents a number of questions
relating to each of the perspectives. Data on VC firm characteristics gathered from the
questionnaire—investment size, stage, and industry preferences—were further supplemented or cross-checked with data from industry directories (EVCA guide and directories
of the national VC associations).
The questionnaire was administered by mail to the head offices of all 106 VC firms in
the United Kingdom, identified by using the British Venture Capital Association handbook and the Center for Management Buy-Out Research records, in 1998. The questionnaires were then translated into Dutch, French, German, and Swedish. In the other
countries covered in this study, questionnaires were sent out in the autumn of 2001.
Questionnaires were sent to the following VC firms: 79, Belgian; 120, French; 191,
German; 169, Swedish; and 54, Dutch. These firms were identified as VC firms because
they were full members of the EVCA or because of their national VC associations. In
order to be as complete as possible, some nonmember firms that act as VC firms were
added to the sample. In all countries, follow-up was undertaken by sending reminders or
by calling the VC firms after 3–6 weeks. Responses were sought from individuals at the
level of investment executives upwards. An early pilot study in the United Kingdom
(Lockett & Wright, 2001) showed that the issues examined here were generally driven by
138

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->organization-wide policies and hence, only a single respondent would be able to provide
the company-wide perspective.
Response rates were good, ranging from a low of 36% in Germany to a high of 59%
in the United Kingdom. The total sample consists of 317 usable responses (44% response
rate). More than 90% of the respondents had ever been involved in a syndicate. The
representativeness of the sample was tested for each country separately using firm-specific
characteristics (minimum and maximum investment preferences and the number of staff
members) available from the national and European VC directories. In Belgium, France,
Germany, and the Netherlands, no significant differences were found between respondent
and nonrespondents. In Sweden and the United Kingdom, the respondents’ maximum
investment preference is significantly larger than that of nonrespondents. Together with
the high response rates, this indicates that the sample is representative for the VC industry
in the six countries included in the study.
Table 2 gives a description of the sample, after removing three outliers (one VC firm
with 3,000 portfolio companies and two VC firms without investment executives). A VC
firm employs, on average, 7.7 (median = 5) investment executives and has, on average,
36.4 (median = 15) investments in its current portfolio. Each investment executive thus
manages, on average, 5.7 (median = 3.5) portfolio companies. The minimum investment
preference is, on average, €2.91 million (median = €0.50 million), while the maximum
investment preference is, on average, €18.81 million (median = €5.00 million). The
average age of a VC firm in the sample is 10.4 years (median = 7 years).

Dependent Variables
In order to test the importance of the motives of interest in this study, the respondents
were asked to indicate on 5-point Likert scales how important they find different items in
their decision to syndicate deals (see Appendix). In order to test the selection motive, we
employed a single item, namely, “the need to seek the advice of other VC firms before
investing.” The results for the selection motive should therefore be interpreted with
caution. We included this item in the factor analysis in order to control for whether it could
discriminate between the other motives. The rotated factor analysis revealed that the items
load on four factors: a finance motive, a deal flow motive, a selection motive, and a valueadding motive (see Appendix). The internal reliability of the scales is high for three out of
the four factors, with Cronbach’s alphas of 0.74 for the finance motive (three items), 0.82
for the deal flow motive (two items), and 0.81 for the value-adding motive (five items).1
The items for these factors were summed and the average was computed. The selection
motive did not load on any of these factors and was isolated through a fourth factor in the
analysis.

Methods and Independent Variables
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to test the above hypotheses. Given that
early stage VC firms may be different from later stage VC firms, bivariate nonparametric
Mann–Whitney statistics were used to test the difference in importance of the four motives
for early stage and later stage investors. We obtain comparable results with parametric
t-tests. We further ran multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and ordinal
1. In order to check the consistency of the data across the countries, we recomputed the scales in the different
countries separately. The scales are reliable in all countries.

VC firm characteristics (cf. infra) as independent variables. The multivariate regressions
were run not only on the total sample, but also on the subsample of early stage VC firms
on the one hand and of later stage VC firms on the other hand.
The subsamples of early stage and later stage VC firms are constructed as follows.
Following Mayer, Schoors, and Yafeh (2005), we computed the “average investment
stage” variable, reflecting the average stage in which a VC firm invests. We first collected
data on the stages in which each VC firm invests: seed, start-up, expansion, and
replacement/buy-out investments. Each stage was given a value from 1 for seed investments to 4 for replacement or buy-out investments. The average was calculated for each
VC firm by adding these numbers and dividing the total by the number of investment
stages in which the VC firm invests (Mayer et al., 2005). For example, a VC firm that
invests in the startup and expansion stage will have an average of 2.5 = (2 + 3)/2. The
sample was then split up between early stage and later stage investors using this average
stage variable. The distribution of the “average investment stage” variable is bimodal, with
maxima at 2.5 and 3.5 and a low at 2.66. Therefore, we split the sample into a subsample
of early stage VC firms with an average investment stage of 2.5 or lower (n = 128) and a
subsample of later stage VC firms with an average investment stage of three or higher
(n = 146). We excluded two firms with an average of 2.66.
The characteristics of the subsamples of early stage versus later stage investors are
presented in Table 2. To indicate differences between the means of these two groups,
t-tests were used. Early stage investors have significantly fewer investments in their
portfolio. While early stage investors have, on average, 25.4 (median = 12) investments in
their portfolio, later stage investors have, on average, 49.0 (median = 20). The median
values for the minimum investment preference (€1 million versus €0.25 million) and the
maximum investment preference (€6.9 million versus €2.5 million) are, of course, higher
for later stage investors compared with early stage investors. The difference in mean for
minimum investment preference is marginally significant, whereas the difference in mean
for maximum investment preference is highly significant. In order to measure the specialization of the VC firms with respect to industry and geographic region, the respondents
were asked to indicate on a 5-point Likert scale how specialized their VC firm’s investment preference is in terms of industry sector and geographic region, with 1 = highly
unspecialized and 5 = highly specialized. The specialization in terms of geographic scope
is, on average, 3.46 on a 5-point Likert scale, while the specialization in terms of industry
sector is 3.14 on a 5-point Likert scale. Later stage investors are also significantly less
specialized in specific industries and in geographic areas compared with early stage
investors. Moreover, early stage investors have a significantly higher propensity to syndicate than later stage investors. Finally, early stage investors are, on average, significantly
younger than later stage investors, with an average of 7 years (median = 4 years), compared with 13.6 years (median = 12 years).
Several VC firm characteristics were used in the multivariate regressions. Table 3
gives the correlation between all variables. We have four proxies of VC firm size, either
self-reported or taken from industry directories: number of investment executives, number
of portfolio companies, and minimum and maximum investment preferences (see
Table 2). The correlation between all four size variables is high except between the
number of investments in the portfolio and the minimum investment preference (see
Table 3). We included, therefore, only one proxy for size in the multivariate analyses,
namely, “the maximum investment preference.” We also used industry and geographic
preferences in the multivariate analyses. Furthermore, we included the average stage
variable discussed earlier and the proportion of investments as nonlead. Finally, we

Results
The Importance of the Four Different Motives
Table 4 shows the importance of the different motives relating to a VC firm’s decision
to syndicate a deal in the sample as a whole and for the early and later stage VC firms
separately.2
The traditional finance motive for syndication is significantly more important than the
other motives tested in our questionnaire (mean = 3.99; see Table 4). This is the most
important motive overall, and for both early and later stage VC firms. If the size of the deal
is large compared with the size of the fund, or if additional rounds of financing are
expected, then VC firms are more likely to syndicate their deals.
Our data show that the deal flow motive (mean = 2.73) is significantly less important
than the finance motive (mean = 3.99) for European VC firms, but is significantly more
important than the value-adding motive (mean = 2.50) and the selection motive (mean =
2.36) for the total sample (Table 4). The deal selection motive is a significantly less
important motive to syndicate than the finance motive, but is not significantly different
from the value-adding motive.

The Finance Motive
An examination of the results of the multivariate analyses indicates that, and in
contrast to hypothesis 1a, the finance motive is not more important for early stage VC
firms than for later stage VC firms. The coefficient in the OLS regression for the total
sample is not significant (see Table 5), and the Mann–Whitney test reports no significant
difference between the sample of early and later stage investors (see Table 4). The finance
motive is the most important motive for syndication (among those tested in this study) for
all VC firms, both early stage and later stage: the difference between the finance and all
the other motives is highly significant for the total sample and for both subsamples.
Hypothesis 1a is therefore not supported.
The coefficient of the size variable is significantly negative. Consistent with hypothesis 1b, the finance motive is more important for small VC firms than for large VC firms
in the total sample regression. The regressions for the two subsamples of early and later
stage investors are not significant.

The Deal Flow Motive
Table 4 suggests that the deal flow motive is significantly more important for later
stage VC firms than for early stage VC firms. While the deal flow motive is significantly
more important than the selection and value-adding motives for later stage VC
2. Similar analyses were run in each country separately. The importance of the motives to syndicate a deal is
consistent across all countries, highlighting the fact that VC practices are very similar in different European
countries. This finding strengthens the validity of our approach to pool respondents from the different
countries into one sample for further analyses.

<-----Page 15----->firms, there is no difference between the importance of these motives for early stage VC
firms. The multivariate regressions for the deal flow motive in the total sample and in
the sample of later stage investors are not significant (see Table 5). The regressions for
the sample of early stage investors are, however, significant. The coefficient for the size
proxy is significant and has the expected sign. Hypothesis 2a is therefore supported in
the sample of early stage investors: the deal flow motive is more important for larger
VC firms. The coefficient of industry specialization is not significant. Hypothesis 2b
that states that the deal flow motive is less important for specialized VC firms is therefore not supported.

The Selection Motive
Hypothesis 3a, which states that early stage VC firms syndicate more than later stage
VC firms for deal selection purposes, is supported in the bivariate analyses (see Table 4)
but not in the multivariate analyses (see Table 5). The coefficient of the average stage
variable has, however, the expected sign and a p-value of 0.129. The evidence is thus
mixed. The bivariate analyses further suggest that the value-adding motive is marginally
more important than the selection motive for later stage VC firms, but not for early stage
VC firms. Deal flow, selection, and value adding are equally important motives for
syndication for the latter. In the multivariate analyses, the coefficient for the percentage of
deals done as nonlead investor has the expected sign and is significant. Hypothesis 3b is
therefore supported for the total sample of VC firms. Hypothesis 3b is further supported
for the subsamples of early and later stage investors. However, for later stage investors, the
regression is only marginally significant. The finding that nonlead investors rely on the
selection skills of lead investors is thus mainly driven by the behavior of early stage
investors. In the subsample of early stage investors, industry specialization has the
expected sign and is significant. The geographic specialization variable is not significant,
however. Hypothesis 3c is therefore partially supported for early stage VC firms: the deal
selection motive is significantly less important for VC firms that are specialized in a
specific industry.

The Value-adding Motive
The bivariate analyses indicate that the value-adding motive is significantly more
important for early stage VC firms compared with later stage VC firms (see Table 4). This
is also confirmed in the multivariate analyses for the total sample: the coefficient for the
average stage variable is significant and negative (see Table 5). However, the regression
model for the total sample is only marginally significant. Thus, there is limited support for
hypothesis 4a. The coefficient for the percentage of investments undertaken as a nonlead
investor is positive and significant for the total sample. Hypothesis 4b is hence supported
for the total sample; the more a VC firm invests as a nonlead investor, the more important
the value-adding motive will be. This is also supported within the sample of early and later
stage VC firms. The coefficient is only marginally significant, however. The value-adding
motive is also more important for larger early stage investors, but is less important for
larger later stage investors. Again, we should note that both the regression model for later
stage and the coefficient for the size proxy are only marginally significant. Our coefficients for industry and geographic specialization are not significant. Hypothesis 4c is
therefore not supported.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->Conclusions and Discussion
Motives for Syndication
The study highlights a number of key findings. First, we show that overall VC
portfolio management strategy is a major driver of syndication. This driver may have been
underestimated in previous studies on syndication behavior. Among the motives considered here, the motives for syndicating a deal are driven much more by finance considerations or, more broadly, by portfolio management considerations, than by the wish to
exchange firm-specific resources for selecting and managing specific deals. European VC
managers mainly consider syndication as a means to improve the management of their
overall portfolio. The main purpose of syndication is to increase portfolio diversification,
to allow VC firms to invest in deals that otherwise would be too large, and to improve
access to future deal flow. Syndication as a means to improve preinvestment selection of
individual deals and to enhance postinvestment monitoring and value adding in specific
deals is much less important than other studies suggest.
Our results contrast with those of the majority of studies on syndication in that we find
much greater support for financial motives and much less support for deal-specific
motives. Although some studies, e.g., Bygrave and Timmons (1992), and Zacharakis
(2002), acknowledge that financial considerations are important drivers of syndication,
the majority of findings suggests the importance of better decision making (selection) or
value adding as motives for driving syndication. Lerner (1994) shows that syndication is
a way to better assess the information provided by potential portfolio companies. Syndication thus leads to better deal selection. More recently, Brander et al. (2002) show that
syndication leads to higher performance in the portfolio company. They therefore conclude that syndication partners add value beyond those of the lead investors. In the same
vein, Jääskeläinen et al. (2002) show that VC executives are able to efficiently manage a
larger number of portfolio companies if they syndicate, thanks to additional resources
brought in by syndication partners.
Is this an evidence of different syndication behaviors of European and American VC
investors? It might well be that European VC managers underestimate the role that
syndication may play in accessing information, knowledge, value-adding skills, and deal
flow. Our preliminary interviews did not reveal this, though. Rather, the VC managers
interviewed expressed the view that they were unlikely to invest in a deal if they did not
have confidence in their own knowledge/abilities with respect to a particular deal and its
sector. Another explanation for the striking differences between our results and previous
studies may be that most studies on syndication have taken the individual deal as a unit of
analysis, while this study focuses on the syndication policy of a VC firm. When analyzing
why a particular deal is syndicated or not, it is likely that portfolio perspectives (finance
and deal flow motives) are less prominent than deal perspectives (selection and valueadding motives).

VC Firm Characteristics That Influence the Motives for Syndication
The finance motive is the most important motive for syndication for both early and
later stage VC firms. This is an interesting finding given the emphasis in earlier studies
on early stage ventures. While the deal flow, selection, and value-adding motives are
equally important for early stage VC firms, there is a clear hierarchy of motives for later
stage VC firms. For later stage VC firms, the finance motive is followed by the deal
flow motive, which in turn is significantly more important than the value-adding motive,
March, 2006

147

<-----Page 17----->but the latter motive is significantly more important than the selection motive. Value
adding is not an important motive for any VC firm. Nevertheless, it is more important
for early than for later stage investors. Access to specific skills from syndicate partners
in order to improve the management of an individual investment is thus more important
for early stage investors than for later stage investors. This is not surprising, as
value adding is, in general, more important for early stage investors (Sapienza et al.,
1996).
The size of a VC firm has an impact on the reasons to syndicate. We find that
the finance motive is less important for larger later stage VC firms. Larger VC firms are
less restricted by their fund size in their investment policy. They are able to diversify
their portfolio by investing in a larger number of deals, to invest in large deals, and to
provide follow-on finance when needed. This explains why larger later stage VC firms
syndicate less for financial reasons. Syndication is, however, a strategy for small VC
firms to overcome their liability of smallness. We think that this may also partly
explain the difference we found between syndication motives in the present and
earlier studies. It may be that the European VC firms in our sample are, on average,
smaller than those in previous, mostly U.S.-based, studies, and that their smallness
explains why financial motives are more important for them. An unexpected finding is
the fact that large early stage VC firms put a higher emphasis on the value-adding
motive compared with smaller early stage investors, everything else equal. We may
expect that larger early stage investors have more in-house knowledge and resources.
This calls for further research on the relation between syndication strategies and VC
firm size.
The deal flow motive is, on the other hand, more important for larger early stage VC
firms than for smaller early stage VC firms. Larger VC firms need to invest in more deals
and therefore need to have access to a larger deal flow, everything else equal.3 Finally, it
is rather surprising that the selection and value-adding motives are more important for
larger early stage VC firms than for smaller early stage VC firms, controlling for the
number of investments per investment executive. One may expect that larger VC firms
have more resources and knowledge in-house, all other things being equal, and therefore
have a lower need to rely upon selection and value-adding skills of outside partners. This
intriguing finding calls for more research.
Neither the industry nor the geographic specialization of a VC firm has an influence
on the importance of any of the motives to syndicate except for the selection motive.
Nonspecialized early stage VC firms syndicate more for deal selection purposes than
specialized early stage VC firms, but not for value-adding purposes. Our lack of more
significant findings should be treated with caution, however, as we rely upon a crude
measure of VC firm specialization. Research that uses a more refined measure of VC
specialization may yield stronger conclusions.
Finally, the more a VC firm syndicates as a nonlead investor, the more important
access to specific deal management skills from syndicate partners will be. The selection
and value-adding motives are significantly more important when a VC firm acts more as
a nonlead investor. In that situation, VC firms rely on their syndicate partners for preinvestment selection and for postinvestment monitoring and value adding. Clearly, lead and
nonlead investors syndicate for different reasons.

3. The correlations suggest that larger VC firms, with a higher maximum investment preference, also have
more companies in their portfolio.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 18----->Implications for Practitioners
This study has implications for both researchers and practitioners. We stress the fact
that our results show very similar syndication practices across different European countries. This indicates a high degree of institutionalization of an accepted way of working
throughout the European VC industry. This contrasts with findings in earlier studies on the
European VC industry, which found important differences in the way VC firms work in
different European countries (Manigart et al., 2002; Sapienza et al., 1996). Despite the
difference between the market-driven financial system in the United Kingdom on the one
hand and the more bank-driven financial system (Black & Gilson, 1998) in the other
Continental European countries covered in this study on the other, and notwithstanding
the different degrees of maturity of the VC markets in the different countries in our study,
our results are remarkably consistent across countries. VC practices have clearly spread
across Europe without taking national boundaries into consideration. The VC industry
appears to be evolving toward a uniform pan-European industry, with comparable
methods of working. It is likely that syndication practices have helped to spread common
norms and behavior (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001).
We would urge VC managers to formulate explicit strategies with respect to syndication. It seems that VC managers are well aware of the financial benefits that syndication
may yield, but they seem to underestimate the importance of additional benefits, such as
obtaining access to additional information and skills, building strong and trustworthy
networks, and increasing deal flow. We are, however, not blind to the fact that more
partners in a syndicate also means more complex managerial issues after the investment
has been made and more dilution of ownership (Wright & Lockett, 2003). More research
is needed to assess where the optimal trade-off point lies.

Avenues for Future Research
Research on syndication in the VC industry has only recently started to receive
attention, although studying syndication behavior in this setting is relevant beyond the VC
community. A syndication involves a partnership between two investors, but unlike traditional alliances, there is an important third—independent—party, namely, the portfolio
company. This increases the complexity of the situation, as there are potential agency
problems between the portfolio company and the lead investor on the one hand, and
between the lead and the nonlead investor on the other hand. We call for more research on
the different positions of lead and nonlead investors. Little is known about how lead and
nonlead investors behave differently (though see Wright & Lockett, 2003). The deal
selection process of nonlead investors may be different from that of lead investors. The
characteristics of the portfolio company and those of the lead investor may affect the
decision of the nonlead to join a syndicate. After the deal is done, the monitoring and
value-adding behavior is likely to be affected by the lead or nonlead position of an
investor. Finally, VC firms that have a strategy to invest predominantly as lead investors
may have different portfolio strategies from those that predominantly invest as nonleads.
More research is needed in this area, e.g., on the impact of agency risks, of transaction
costs, and of trust on the initiation and subsequent management of a syndicate
arrangement.
Further research may also usefully consider the effects of different rounds of investment on the syndication decision. Our research, along with most other research on
syndication, has not taken the effect of different rounds of investment into account. For
example, VC firms may syndicate for different reasons in the various rounds of an early
stage investment. As the venture becomes more established and larger, the deal selection

more important. This may have implications for the type of VC firm that it seeks at each
stage. Further, the performance of the venture at the time a new investment round is
planned may also have an impact on the type of syndicates that will be formed.
Finally, there is more work to be done on the relation between syndication strategies
and performance, both on the level of the portfolio companies and on the level of a VC
firm. As stated, the trade-off between the benefits of syndication and the costs associated
with managing more complex situations is not well understood yet. We need to know more
on the management of syndicates. All this will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding
of the fundamental trade-off each VC firm has to make between running the VC firm as
either a traditional hands-off financial intermediary on the one hand, where financial
risk-return considerations are the most important management criteria, or running it as a
hands-on value-added investor.
We conclude by calling for more studies that explicitly take into account the difference in institutional environments in the behavior of VC firms. There is a need to model
and to test more specifically the effect of institutional environments on syndication
behavior. Comparative research on syndication practices may be especially important as
evidence from Venture Economics indicates that over 60% of VC investments in the
United States in 2000 were syndicated. This figure compares with EVCA data of 13% in
the United Kingdom and 30% across Europe as a whole.4 Similarly, extending the analysis
to compare VC syndication practices between Europe, the United States, and Asia is an
interesting avenue for further research. Asian VC markets are developing rapidly (Lockett
& Wright, 2002), and previous research has shown that there are important differences
between U.S., European, and Asian VC industry practices (Black & Gilson, 1998; Jeng &
Wells, 2000). For example, the VC market in the United States is more dominated by
earlier stage investments than is the case in Europe, while late stage investment is more
important in Asia. Investigating similarities and potential differences in syndication
motives and propensity may yield interesting insights.

4. One should be careful, however, when comparing U.S. and European figures. As stated, U.S. figures focus
on pure early stage VC, while European figures include both early and later stage VC or private equity. As we
have shown, early and later stage investors have different syndication strategies.
