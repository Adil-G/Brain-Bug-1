Chapter 1

A Study of New Business Venture
Trust
1. 1 The Role and Function of Trust for
New Business Ventures
Every established business enterprise has once started as a new venture. The
existing enterprise managed to survive the period of start-up and early
development. New businesses are vulnerable and many do not survive the first
few years. One very large study of survival rate of start-ups among 3.6 million
firms found that only two out of five new firms survived the first six years
(Vesper, 1990, p. 32).
No wonder that there is an large amount of books and start-up training
courses etc. oriented towards giving business starters practical "hands-on" advice
on how to manage and succeed with a new venture. "Hands-on" advice generally
means normative prescriptions on matters like how to raise capital, how to
formulate a business idea, how to select between legal forms of business in a
specific country, how to approach potential customers etc. Often advice
concerning a precise sequence of start activities can be found: Get funding first
or get customers first. These prescriptions are often given in a tone of "Do it in
this way and you will succeed". This way of approaching business start-up gives
important information in start-up situations but is at the same time problematic
from at least two angles. Firstly, empirical research indicates that there is no one
"best" way to start a business. Vesper (1990, pp. 112 - 118) found a wide variety
of different ways to start for new ventures that were successful. Secondly, the
business start-up is a matter not only for the starter but also for others in contact
with the new venture, notably customers, suppliers and financers in spe. That is
also to say: Relationships between the business starter and other actors around
the new venture are important for the start-up. Relationships differ beween every
specific start-up situation due to the basic fact that people differ in the situations.
Relationships - new or existing from before - are thus fundamental for the
new venture to enter into exhange on markets, acquire necessary legitimacy to

<-----Page 1----->2

act or just to get important information for operations. Advice on action must
take relationships into account, as a prerequisite for action to be understood or
accepted. For example the network research approach to study business
formation assumes that the key to success is the ability to develop and maintain a
personal network of ties and linkages (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986; Birley, 1985;
Johannisson, 1988). This line of research has brought attention to the quantity
and intensiveness of relations as well as the implications thereof. But important
questions remain: Why has a network a specific extension and intensiveness?
What determines the network? What underlies an observed set of network ties
and linkages? Network characteristics can be seen as an outward display of the
parties' inner meaning. The parties' meaning concerning a relationship is
fundamental for the relationship as such. This issue has been recognized in the
business formation network approach (e.g. Johannisson, 1988) but the meaning
of relationships in connection to business start-up deserves to be more focused,
be it by network studies or in other ways.
The notion of meaning, used in the last paragraph, in connection with
business formation can be exemplified concerning the external actors. It is vital
for them to judge whether it is certain, probable or at least reasonable that the
new venture can deliver products/services, pay for material bought, pay rent on
loans etc. The business starter must be trusted. Trust is one meaning in relationships and action. New businesses may have a history, if for example the
entrepreneur starting the business is not new in the industry. Trust may then exist
since before. But in many cases the new venture is not a well-known actor in the
market for products, capital and other resources and has no adequate
trustworthiness with external actors. For a new venture to establish itself as an
actor, secure its position in the markets and develop, trustworthiness is
important.
The importance of trust for a new business venture has been discussed by
some writers in the literature concerning new business ventures. Birley &
Norburn (1985) write that young companies often fail because they do not
succeed in acquiring credibility. They need money to buy equipment, lease
space, hire people etc. Credibility has to be gained with stakeholders providing
the resources. The entrepreneur must
establish personal credibility in the eyes of at least one of the stakeholder groups to
survive. As business grows, personal credibility will be replaced by corporate credibility.
The organisation will have a track record - critical factor for survival of the small firm.
By definition, large firms already possess that characteristic of corporate credibility (p.
84).

<-----Page 2----->3

How can trust be gained? MacMillan (1983) points at the need to use trusted
contacts to increase one's own trustworthiness:
The entrepreneur must be able to mobilize all parties with a stake in the new venture to
commit themselves firmly to it. One way of developing credibility is via a network of
influential contacts (p. 8).

But MacMillan (1983) also points at a catch-22 situation due to stakeholders
watching each other before they act:
Stakeholders will not join in until commitments from other stakeholders are forthcoming.
More often than not, none of these parties wants to be the first to commit itself to a new
venture. Entrepreneurs must learn to anticipate resistance or reluctance, and develop
political skills to neutralize and overcome it (p. 8).

Concerning stakeholders' importance and the impact of their assessment
Diffenbach & Higgins (1987) write that credibility refers to how others view a
company's strategy and strategic planning capability. Credibility is likely to be
critical in different situations. So, they contend, a start-up firm is especially
vulnerable to low credibility. But they also refer to examples where the start-up
companies enjoyed high trustworthiness when organised by leading teams with
successful track records from other firms. This e.g. allowed raising a large sum
of start-up funds in a referred case study.
Bird (1992) elaborates the theme above in the way that the venture takes
shape in the public eye as the firm establishes credit, acquires resources and
manages timely payment. Events like writing a business plan, signing a lease,
sales to the first customer take on symbolic meaning - "Symbolic Marker
Events". Due to such events people more and more come to trust the
organisation. Through the symbols the organisation acquires verification by
social construction of the organisation's reality (Berger & Luckmann, 1967).
Bird's approach contains the view of action and events evolving over time. The
actors base their action on events and others' actions, which become meaningful
in that they are given symbolic interpretation.
The quotations above point at trustworthiness or credibility as an
important issue concerning new ventures. But apart from stating importance, the
writers do not explicitly study the role and function of trust in new business
ventures. This study agrees on the general view of the above quoted authors
concerning trust as an important issue in business start-up and early
development. This view will also be further qualified by new aspects in
discussions in this book. But the main reason for the study is not to state the
importance of trust in a general or normative sense but to bring the investigation

<-----Page 3----->4

further into the notion of trust bringing insight into and answers to questions
like: How does trust make sense for entrepreneurs and external actors in business
start-up and early development? What does trust mean for different actors? Has
trust the same or different meaning over time during the start-up and early
development process? How is trust-building performed? Specifically, how does
the entrepreneur use trustworthiness or build trustworthiness among different
actors? Do the actors make sense of specific patterns of action in building and
using trust?
Answers to such questions bring insights into how entrepreneurs and
external actors act when they see trust as meaningful. Thereby the study can
contribute to theory concerning entrepreneurship by concept-building with focus
on action processes and trust. So the study's over-all purpose is to contribute to
knowledge of the role and function of trust in business start-up and early
development in action processes between entrepreneurs and external actors.
This over-all purpose is broad and needs to be delimited to a few tangible
aspects. Therefore, the study is designed to deal with three specific research
issues.
The first issue becomes: What are the external actor's bases for trust in
the entrepreneur and the new venture? Trust is a complicated and multifacetted
phenomenon, which needs to defined for any specific study purpose. Trust
between actors in business start-up is individually and socially constructed
meaning governing the commitment between the actors. What one actor sees as
important for trust in the other, i.e. what makes sense for trust, becomes a
starting point for further analysis. Therefore insight into constructed meanings of
trust is needed and a language representation for the findings - in the form of a
taxonomy concerning trust bases - will open up for the continued analysis.
Trust as a mental representation between two actors may change over time
due to action performed and the actors' interpretation of consequences, though.
An actor makes sense of her/his trustworthiness in the eyes of the other actor but
how does s/he cope with the need to be trusted? Particularly, how can the actor
handle a situation where trustworthiness is not or can be assumed to not be
adequate? The second study issue then becomes: How do entrepreneurs and
external actors use and build trust in action processes?
In trust between two actors more complex patterns concerning trust may
be constructed by them. Trust may involve intermediaries in a role of conveying
trust. The third research issue therefore becomes: Do entrepreneurs and external
actors in action processes repeatedly use intermediaries for trust-building and
assessment of trust?

<-----Page 4----->5

These three research issues will form three steps in the analyses, forming
the main contents of chapters 6, 7 and 8 respectively. But before that a number of
central concepts need to be discussed and defined, along with a frame of
reference as a basis for the study.

1. 2 New Business Venture - An Equivocal
Situation
1. 2. 1 Business Start-up and Early Development
The term new /business/venture will in the study be used covering both busines
start-up and early development based on the following discussion.

Business Start-up
First of all, it is important to define business. The Concise Oxford Dictionary
(1976, p. 133) gives two relevant definitions:
1/ Buying and selling; commerce; trade
2/ Commercial house; firm.
The first definition concerns transaction and exchange made on just one
occasion or, as the notions of trade and commerce clearly imply, transactions and
exchanges repeatedly performed over time. The last notion brings us over to the
second definition: Repeatedly performed transactions and exchanges will
become the basis for a commercial firm, i.e. an organisation that deals with
business transactions and exchanges.
So, one way of seeing business start-up is that transactions and exchanges
performed repeatedly form the commercial enterprise in a process of organising.
"To organise is to assemble ongoing independent activities into sensible
sequences that generate sensible outcomes" (Weick 1979, p. 3). In chapter 3 we
will go deeper into what organising means in a business start-up situation.
The entrepreneur - one person or more for a specific venture - is a key
element. S/he acts to perform business transactions: Selling, buying, acquisition
of necessary funds, production or management of how goods and services are
produced. In these actions the entrepreneur as an actor acts with other actors:
customers, suppliers, financers etc. So, there is an interplay between the
entrepreneur and the environment. Different actors interplay on several
occasions or repeatedly, forming processes of action and interaction. Gartner

<-----Page 5----->6

(1985) describes new venture creation as an interplay between four components:
Individual(s), environment, process and organisation.
In this interplay the entrepreneur seeks out resources and competences in
the market place. A combination of individuals, environment and action
processes shapes the organisation formed.
Gartner (1985) also means that actions evolve in their own particular way for
each new business start-up. It is not instantaneously produced, but evolves over
time. Each business start-up is both a unique and complex phenomenon.
Foundings occur within a time-pace context in which the order of events is a
critical part of the process (Bird, 1992, p. 13 ).
Empirically, to distinguish between an entrepreneur and a new business
venture is not easy (Birley & Norburn, 1985, p. 82). Obviously, an entrepreneur
is a prerequisite for a new venture to occur. In the continued start-up, the
entrepreneur will take part in almost all action, until maybe other people not
fulfilling the entrepreneurial role come into the play. Then the typical roles for
manager vs. employee, problems about differentiation and integration of tasks
etc. - that we recognise in the traditional management and organisation theory may become issues in what is by then an established enterprise.
There is normally a period between the entrepreneur's starting to act and
the formal registration of a firm. Reynolds (1993) uses the term nascent
entrepreneur covering the period when the prospective entrepreneur works with
the idea in her/his head. The pre-start-up period covers in Kazanjian's (1988)
terminology activities up to formal registration. In the pre-start period there does
not yet exist a firm, which can legally assume rights and obligations (apart from
an extrapreneurial situation, where the prospective entrepreneur can act in
another firm). This must be done by the entrepreneur in person, which may make
a clear difference in the eyes of surrounding actors and the general environment.
Formal registration means that there is a firm in the legal sense, which in
accordance with laws governing forms of enterprises (i.e. firms), brings rights
and obligations to bear. Formal registration is important in that the business startup gets its own identity in the eyes of surrounding actors and the general
environment.
Based on this discussion the study will use business start-up as a
collective name for the action processes starting with the entrepreneur's
sensemaking of a business opportunity continuing until the formal registration of
a firm.

Early Development

<-----Page 6----->7

New venture creation is an emerging organisation (Gartner et al., 1992, Gartner,
1993). Emerge means that a phenomenon becomes manifest, comes into view,
and does that by evolution. The view is also one of diversity: Each business'
early development is in itself specific. Gartner (1985, p. 696) refers to literature
surveys showing that differences between entrepreneurs are as great as the
variation between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. Likewise, differences
among their ventures are great just they are between new firms and established
firms. Even if development in processes is firm-specific, there are two
distinguishing features. One common feature is that the formal registration of the
firm has brought rights and obligations to bear. Another common feature is early
development often characterised by vulnerability, which manifests itself in a
weak or unstable financial position of the firm (Vesper, 1990, p 32). More
basically, vulnerability is due to lack of effective relationships (Singh, Tucker &
House, 1986) or undeveloped ones in its environment (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994).
Other studies show that survival rates increase after the first years (Singh, House
& Tucker, 1986). Relations with external actors become more established
(Stinchcombe 1965). Olofsson (1979) uses the term environmental anchorage,
denoting a situation where a developing enterprise establishes co-operation with
organisations, groups or individuals representing the intended market or which
are expected to be important for the market the enterprise strives to establish.
Early development will in this study be used as a collective name for the
action processes from formal registration onwards. The notion "early" just
implies that the first few years after start-up will be in focus.1

Business Start-up and Early Development - an Equivocal Situation
Discussing what is problematic for business start-up and early development for
emerging organisation, Gartner et al (1992) express their stance:
Emerging organizations are thoroughly equivocal realities that tend towards nonequivocality through entrepreneurial action (p. 17).
1

The notion of "early" in early development can imply that the firm changes its situation in a
specific way. Normann (1975, p. 184) distinguishes between early and mature stages of
development, where early development is characterized by a view of process, growth and
learning. For mature development a view of goal, business ideas and harvesting from tangible
and intangible investments is more typical. However, we consider that the process and goal
views are not necessarily based on stage development of the firm. Furthermore, growth views
are often not important for new ventures. Finally, a culture of learning may be more contingent
on type of environment and industry than the position of a firm's development. The discussion
shows that the notion of "early" easily becomes problematic linked to firm characteristics. Our
needs to delimit a study period of new firms is not linked to any other characteristics than just
having operated for a short time, hence the more pragmatic notion of "early".

<-----Page 7----->8

The concept equivocal is based on Weick (1979) and denotes a situation
with abundance of information, which can be given two or more interpretations.
In an equivocal situation it can for example be difficult to assess cause - effect
relationships. In emerging organisations, entrepreneurs will give plausible
explanations of current and future equivocal events by non-equivocal
interpretation. Entrepreneurs talk and act "as if" equivocal events are nonequivocal (Gartner et. al. 1992). Action is taken in expectation of non-equivocal
events occurring in the future. Starr & Macmillan (1990) give a good example in
describing how an entrepreneur secured the use of a friend's business resources
(office equipment and delivery van) during the start-up of an import business to
show outsiders his available resources. They actually took it for granted that
these resources were acquired on a permanent basis. Outsiders are likely to
respond to an emerging business "as if" it were an existing business: They will
place orders, offer material on credit etc.2
In contrast, according to Gartner et. al. (1992), the established
organisation is more bound-up in non-equivocal events. Individuals behave more
in a context of already determined (and interpreted) interactions. Individuals in
existing organisations tend to "take-for-granted" (Powell & Di Maggio, 1991)
that certain interactions will occur and that these interactions will have a
particular meaning to those individuals involved. Established organisations
function more on the basis that individuals, both in and around the organisation,
have developed a common view of meaning in interaction.
Our conclusion from this discussion will be: One should be cautious in
seeing the equivocality concerning emerging and existing organisations as
exactly contrary, but rather see them as varying. Still, the interaction between
individuals from emerging and established organisations may imply that
expressed desires of unequivocality from emerging organisations will be takenfor-granted by established organisations, since this may be congruent with their
reality. But for the emerging organisation, expressed desire of unequivocality
may reflect a process of building trust.
Going back again to the discussion in section 1.1 we can see that the
quoted references pointed at stakeholders providing resources, sales to customers
and use of influential contacts for ensuring others' commitment (Bird, 1992;
Diffenbach & Higgins, 1987; MacMillan, 1983). Trustworthiness is considered
to be necessary but the surrounding parties' commitment is not certain, according
2

The researcher has studied an entrepreneur, who hired secreterial services only during visits to
the company. Still, the researcher does not consider these examples to contain deception or
fraud, since the resources were actually there to be used on the occasion.

<-----Page 8----->9

to the quoted writers. Seen from the point of view of the entrepreneur the
situations are equivocal and trust may be seen as a way to cope with
equivocality. Therefore we now need to see how equivocality may reside in
some important business matters like the market, the acquisition of funds and
also general relations between entrepreneur and actors surrounding the business
start-up.

1. 2. 2 Equivocality Concerning Market
A new enterprise is often unknown in the market. Its intentions, motives and
goals may not be seen by existing competitors; in Porter's (1980) terminology the
entrant sends market signals that can be characterised as weak. Weak market
signals may enable the new entrant to build a market before competitors react.
However, weak market signals could be contrary to the new entrant's desire to
become a well-known actor among customers in spe, and may make trustbuilding in general more difficult. So the entrepreneur may face an equivocal
situation: To be salient in the market for building trust may evoke more
countermeasures from strong competitors.
Entry barriers for the start-up enterprise can emanate from a number of
sources, the most important being customers, competitor capability and required
assets (Vesper, 1990). Customer habits and beliefs may favour existing products,
if these are considered to be satisfactory. The new entrant has to prove
advantages and change customer thinking - build trustworthiness for the
enterprise and its products. Changes can also be constrained by switching-costs
for customers leaving an old supplier in favour of a new one (Porter, 1980).
Knowledge and skills necessary for the product and market can be a barrier for a
new entrant compared to existing competing enterprises. No wonder therefore
that many investigations show that successful entries into different industries are
made by entrepreneurs with high competence and experience in the same
industry (Diffenbach & Higgins, 1987; Reynolds, 1993). They are often
extrapreneurs, trained in an existing company.3 This makes a situation with
lower equivocality which may facilitate building trustworthiness in the eyes of
external stakeholders. Required assets can be entry barriers. Some assets are
intangible, such as reputation and name recognition. Others may involve formal
documents: patents, trade marks, copyrights, quality certificates and contracts
3

Cooper, 1985; also Hägg & Johnsson, 1985: Extrapreneur is a white-collar worker who leaves
his employment for the purpose of establishing a separate firm which will complement his
earlier employment; they could also establish themselves as competitors.

<-----Page 9----->10

with external actors. There may also be tangible assets: funds, buildings,
production and distribution equipment. In these days information handling
equipment and systems are often vital assets which can sometimes be difficult to
obtain for a start-up. Assets may be important for building and conveying trust
(cf. Birley & Norburn, 1985 above).

1. 2. 3 Equivocality Concerning Acquisition of Funds
Funding, the acquisition of money, is central and underlies much - although not
all - acquisition of other resources. Since a business start-up nearly always is a
small business very much debate regarding small business financing is relevant
also for new ones. A point of departure is the degree to which the start-up is
financed by owner's capital versus borrowed capital. If it is totally financed by
owner's capital, which in itself could be easier to accomplish in a new and small
business, most of the discussion below will be irrelevant. But to a large extent
entrepreneurs need external funding and the following will be important or
crucial.4 The legal forms of proprietorship and partnership, which are common
for start-up in most countries, normally do not permit limited liability provision.
The owner has to bear all the risk including also her/his personal property. In
some countries a small business can be organised as a corporation on the same
lines as a large business, but - at least in Sweden and the United States - owners
will not be protected against personal losses from business failure. The reason is
that they are often required by lenders to provide a personal guarantee or to put
up non-corporate personal assets as security for loans. Trust in the owner will
become an essential issue. The new venture may have less property to offer as
security for loans than an established business. New (and small) businesses also
generally have fewer sources for funds in the capital market. No publicly traded
securities, neither debt nor stock are traded on the capital market, not until the
enterprise may have grown. This also means that market valuation as a basis for
further funding the enterprise does not exist, which makes evaluation of lending
terms more difficult for lenders. The absence of market valuation may make cost
of capital higher for start-ups. The new venture's duration in the market, and
consequently the basis for long-term loans, can be difficult for lenders to judge.
For the lenders, trust in the financial resources and stability will be an issue and
the situation for the borrower will be equivocal.

4

The following discussion is partly based on Ang (1991).

<-----Page 10----->11

An established business applying for new loans is assessed by i.a.
historical performance data (balance sheet, income statement etc.). Start-ups
have no or little such information. Instead they have to be assessed based on
plans instead of performance information, judgement on entrepreneurial
capability etc. New ventures may for the reasons stated here have a weak
bargaining position for funds. Opportunities in the ordinary capital market can be
low and transaction costs for capital high. On the other hand the government
provides support to start-ups in many countries in order to promote new business. Support can be loans (on or below market terms), guarantees or direct
contributions. Personal relations with capital providers are often different for the
start-up. Partly due to a weaker position on the capital market an entrepreneur
may have to rely on other sources for money: friends and relatives (Birley, 1985;
Johannisson, 1988). The owner - employee relationship is often close to personal
(Brytting 1991; Steiner, 1990) and the employees may be capital providers on a
temporary or more permanent basis. New and small business could in this way
get financial flexibility including extra support in financially critical situations.
To this flexibility can also be added that small business owners are often willing
to settle for a lesser monetary reward in return for the fulfillment of objectives
which the ownership function and other non-monetary rewards provide
(Dandridge, 1979). To conclude, instead of trust from a convincing financial
history, the new venture's trustworthiness must be built on other grounds.
Equivocality resides in assessment criteria with less "hard data" which can be
compared to other financial support situations for reduced equivocality.

1. 2. 4 Equivocality and External Actors
The now almost classical quotation in discussing relations between entrepreneurs
and actors surrounding the business start up is the "liability of newness" coined
by Arthur Stinchcombe (1965). He took an interest in what encourages the start
of new organisations but also why new organisations so often fail. He states that,
as a general rule, a higher proportion of new organisations fail than old ones
(Stinchcombe, 1965, p. 148; see e.g. also Singh, House & Tucker, 1986). A new
organisation - especially if it is a new form, e.g. bringing in an innovation - has
to be much more beneficial than the old one to compensate for its newness. He
concludes that if there are populations in which the "liability of newness" is
exceptionally great, organisational innovation will tend to be carried out only
when alternatives are difficult to implement. Equivocality would be a barrier for
new ventures to emerge.

<-----Page 11----->12

Stinchcombe (1965, pp. 148-9) presents four criteria for the liability of
newness: First, new organisations, especially new types of organisations,
generally involve new roles, which have to be learned. In old organisations
former occupants of roles can teach their successors: skills, decision criteria,
responsibilities, devices for conflict-resolving and - and also loyalty to the
organisation. New organisations have to get by with generalised skills produced
elsewhere or to invest in education. Learning costs, including inefficiency from
lack of routine, appear.
Second, the process of inventing new roles, the determination of their
mutual relations and of structuring the field of rewards and sanctions have high
costs in time, worry, conflict and temporary inefficiency. These problems can be
reduced by standard social routines and - more important still - the sense of
responsibility and initiative to get the job done.
Third, new organisations must rely heavily on social relations among
strangers. Relations of trust are more precarious in new than in old organisations.
Trust may concern that a stranger will do the job he says s/he will do,
furthermore that his/her promises to pay actually bind the resources s/he says
they do. Other concerns may be that the new goods stranger describes are
something like what s/he says they are and that the stranger acts from honesty
and competence.
Fourth, one of the main resources of old organisations is a set of stable
ties to those who use organisational services. These ties stand for accurate
knowledge of customers needs and quality requirements. Ties may also stand for
channelling of orders and whom to call for action. These stable ties also imply
personal loyalty in the consumer-producer relation.
All these four criteria of "the liability of newness" have implications for
trust: built-up skills that are visible to others, standard social routines, and
relationships. But it is also vital to qualify Stinchcombe's arguments against
other views and findings: First, not all entrepreneurs are new in their field of
operation. In fact, most have industry experience (Cooper, 1985; Reynolds,
1993) and a built-up network of contacts to use in start-up (Birley & Norburn,
1985).
Second, Stinchcombe (1965) may underestimate the importance of new
forms for innovative work, non-routine can actually be an advantage (Peterson,
1981). Actually, the break away from the tradition and routine can in itself be the
cause of the new business and may have implications for trust. Bull & Willard
(1993) expressed the view that new firms face liability of newness but existing
firms face liabilities of age and tradition.

<-----Page 12----->13

Third, even if Stinchcombe (1965) identifies the sense of responsibility
and initiative to get the job done, he may underestimate strong motivational
forces evoked when the entrepreneur faces the need for survival and expansion an equivocal situation. "We suggest that entrepreneurs create a constellation of
different motivational systems to involve different stakeholder groups in the
organising process" is the conclusion of Gartner, Bird & Starr (1992) from a
review of motivational theories' potential in entrepreneurship research.
Equivocality in relations does not necessarily hamper new ventures, instead it
may evoke action to become established.

1. 2. 5 Conclusion: The Equivocal Situation for the
New Venture Evokes a Need for Trust
The start-up and early development of a new venture is performed by the
entrepreneur as starter of the new venture and by external actors providing
resources for the new venture. The relationships between entrepreneurs and
external actors differ between ventures. The relationships develop differently.
The situation is equivocal for the entrepreneur, i.e. open to many possible
interpretations. Equivocality pertains to relationships to customers and suppliers
(markets), financers (acquisition of funds) and to others bringing important
resources to the new venture. For the entrepreneur, and the other actors, reduced
equivocality makes sense in order to experience lower risks in action involving
the other parties. One way of reducing equivocality and thereby risks is to trust,
either by using existing trust or building trust with important actors. Trust
becomes a vital issue in action processes between the entrepreneur and those
external actors which are important to the new venture.

1. 3 Outline of the Book
Chapters 2 - 4 present the study's frame of reference, which is built on existing
theory: Thus in chapter 2 theories about the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship
are discussed. A short historical background is given on the notion of
entrepreneur. The lack of precision and a clear-cut definition of the notion itself
is discussed. Modern theory of entrepreneurship is then classified and presented
as a ground for the selection of a framework of the entrepreneur for the study.
Chapter 3 is devoted to a presentation of theory about organising and
action process, mainly based on Weick (1979). Sensemaking, i.e. how people
make sense of events and experience is discussed. The social constructionist
view of action process is then applied to organising business start-up and early
development.
Trust is the theme in chapter 4. Different scholars' (mainly economists and
sociologists) writings about trust are compared and discussed as a basis for
defining trust, trustworthiness and mutual trust. Trust is then introduced as a
meaning in sensemaking.
Chapter 5 deals with methodology. The case study design is presented,
along with considerations of different design issues. The chapter includes an

<-----Page 14----->15

overview of how the study was conducted and methods used for data collection,
reduction, interpretation and analysis. Quality criteria are discussed. The cases in
the pre-study and main study are presented.
Chapters 6 - 8 contain analyses of trust and action processes in the cases,
covering both the entrepreneurs and external actors of the new ventures. Chapter
6 thus presents and discusses case data on what external actors base trust in the
entrepreneurs and new ventures: person-based, enterprise-based and institutionbased trust.
An analysis of performed action in the cases is the aim of chapter 7. The
notions of use and build trust are presented. Sequences and patterns of use of
trust and trust-building in six relationships between entrepreneurs and external
actors are studied. Commonalities are identified, concerning how trust develops
in action processes and how trust develops in interaction between two actors.
Chapter 8 brings together the analyses to how entrepreneurs use and build
trustworthiness through intermediaries symbolising trust. How they make sense
of strategies for building and using trust is also identified. These strategies
function as interpretive schemes built on earlier experience.
Chapter 9 presents conclusions from the study in three areas: The findings'
contribution to theory, implications for practice and suggestions for further
research.

Chapter 2

The Entrepreneur and
Entrepreneurship
2. 1 A Short Historical Background
The word entrepreneur derives from the French word entreprendre, meaning to
undertake. The word was in use as early as in the twelfth century and the noun
entrepreneur developed in the course of the fifteenth century. In the early 16th
century the Frenchmen who organised and led military expeditions were referred
to as entrepreneurs. By 1700 the term was applied to road, bridge, harbour, and
fortification contractors, and by the middle of that century, French economists
used the term to designate self-employed persons in the economic sphere as
opposed to hired people (Long, 1983; Peterson, 1981). Richard Cantillon is the
best known of these economists. He said that entrepreneurship entails bearing
the risk of buying at certain prices in the present and selling at uncertain prices in
the future. During the latter part of the eighteenth century the fysiocrats
expanded the concept of entrepreneur into someone "who must have the capacity
of economically combining the appropriate goods and services to the end of his
greatest profit" (Long, 1983, p. 48). The French economist Jean Baptiste Say in
the early nineteenth century with the emerging industrial revolution brought in
attributes like qualities of judgement and talents like the ability to procure loans
of capital. Say described the entrepreneur as someone who shifts economic
resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and
greater yield. Thus the entrepreneur becomes a promoter of economic activity in
general (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990).
This sets the line for the classical economists' view of entrepreneurship;
what matters is the net effect on the general economic system of the
entrepreneur's actions. The micro-economist Marshall, in the first decade of the
20th century, followed by Robinson and Chamberlin in the 1930's, focused their
attention on the market equilibrium. In investigating the consequences of a
particular event in the economy, they examined and compared the equilibrium
conditions (product prices and quantities) before and after the change. An
economist who emphasises equilibrium tends to identify economic development

<-----Page 16----->17

with attaining an equilibrium position in production and consumption. They may
overlook other aspects underlying economic development. Another development
of thoughts concerned economic development due to changes in equilibrium.
Joseph Schumpeter considered entrepreneurship to be the process that
disrupts the market equilibrium, and makes the economy as a whole go forward.
It is a shift from one equilibrium to the next one, in his words "the circular flow".
Its essence is "innovation", a novel recombination of pre-existing factors of
production. "Carry out new combinations" is enterprise, and the individuals who
perform this task are called "entrepreneurs" (Schumpeter, 1934). He
distinguishes as "new combinations":
- introduction of new goods
- new method of production
- opening of a new market
- conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials or semimanufactured goods
- new organisation of an industry.
Schumpeter could be considered as the first in a line of writers to identify
entrepreneurship with innovation. The previous tradition was to use the term
"entrepreneur" for any businessman (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990, p. 19). The
importance of Schumpeter can be characterised in the following way: 1) the
movement from a view of static equilibrium to disequilibrium as a dynamic force
for innovative change in the economy 2) the recognition of the entrepreneurial
function as responsible for economic improvements, due to innovations, and 3)
the distinction between the roles of owner, financer, manager and innovator is
opened up, i.e. the need for more clear notions of "entrepreneurship" and
"entrepreneur" when the words are used.
While Joseph Schumpeter emphasised the equilibrium view, Israel
Kirzner saw entrepreneurship in a still other perspective. He wanted to
understand how the decisions of individual participants in the market interact to
generate the market forces that compel changes in prices, output, and in methods
of production and allocation of resources (Kirzner, 1973, p. 6). These decisions
are made successively and interactively by consumers, entrepreneur-producers
and resource-owners. Taken over time, this series of systematic changes in the
interconnected network of market decisions constitutes the market process
(Kirzner, 1973, p. 10). The lack of knowledge of potential buyers/sellers, output,
prices, qualities etc. among the original sellers and buyers gives room for "an
entrepreneurial element in the market" consisting of "outsiders" who are able to
perceive opportunities for entrepreneurial profits. Apart from these outsiders, the
entrepreneurial element may also reside in actors already in the market,

<-----Page 17----->18

middlemen, as well as in resource owners, producers and managers. (But then
one also has to distinguish the entrepreneurial element from the role as investor,
leader etc.)
There is present in all human action an element which, although crucial to economizing
activity in general, cannot itself be analyzed in terms of economizing, maximizing, or
efficiency criteria (Kirzner, 1973, p. 31).

This concept of entrepreneurial element builds on von Mises' homo agens.
Man is capable of acting in a framework not confined to given ends and means,
which was the normal assumption of earlier economists. The entrepreneurial
element in human decision-making is responsible for our understanding of
human action as active, creative, defining and revising means and ends rather
than as passive, automatic, mechanical and bounded. It is possible to view a
succession of different decisions by the same individual as a logically unified
sequence, with each decision comprehensible as the logical outcome of reflection
and learning from prior decisions (Kirzner, 1973, pp. 35-37) To sum up: Man
learns from her/his experience in the market and changes her/his actions
accordingly. Despite Kirzner's attention to the behavioural aspects in decision
making and action, he could still be classified as an economist. His conclusion,
the arbitrage theory of profit is: Profit opportunities arise when the prices of
products on the product markets are not adjusted to the prices of resources on the
factor markets. Successful entrepreneurship consists in noticing maladjustments
before others do. The entry of entrepreneurs has the effect of adjusting prices and
eliminating profit. In the meantime new reasons for lack of knowledge of price
adjustment come up with room for new entrepreneurial action. Kirzner's
signification for the notion of entrepreneur and entrepreneurship can be
summarised in this way: 1/ he introduces dynamics residing in a wider
perspective on human decision making and action 2/ he displays a focus on a
realistic picture of what constitutes a market, and 3/ he refines the Schumpeterian
discussion on different roles in business including the role of entrepreneurship.

2. 2 The Entrepreneur and Entrepreneurship in Recent Theory
2. 2. 1 The Entrepreneur and Entrepreneurship Elusive Notions?

<-----Page 18----->19

Since the 1960's there has emerged a variety of views on the notions of
entrepreneur and entrepreneurship, due to scholars' different backgrounds,
frames of reference and focus of research interests. Currently, no single
definition of "entrepreneur" has uniformly been accepted. Writers have
expressed concern about the lack of precision in the entrepreneurship literature
(e.g. Bull & Willard, 1993; Bygrave & Hofer, 1991; Carland, Hoy, Boulton &
Carland, 1984; Cunningham & Lischeron, 1991; Gartner, Mitchell & Vesper,
1989; Macmillan & Katz, 1992). The lack of precision is due to the abovementioned different views and interests concerning what to study, but also that
entrepreneurship is - in spite of some writers in history - a rather new field of
research. Bygrave (1989) compared different basic and applied fields of
research. He found that empirical entrepreneurship research has during 30 years
mainly imported and used different concepts from several disciplines.5 Baumol
(1968) once called the entrepreneur an elusive notion. There are also arguments
against the possibility of a precise construct of entrepreneurship, it being used as
too broad a notion.6 Even so, for any specific purpose, it is vital to clarify one's
notion of entrepreneurship, what one includes - and excludes - in using the word.
In this vein, it is possible and worthwhile to classify entrepreneurship research.
In entrepreneurship research, as displayed in the literature and conference
documentation, it is possible to distinguish four main levels of study of
entrepreneurship: Society, clustered enterprises (e.g. industries), enterprise (as an
entity), individual.7 Studies are normally focused on one level, sometimes multilevel studies are designed to identify phenomena on different levels, or
perspectives are selected joining more than one level.8 The purpose of this study
concerns trust between entrepreneurs and external actors, which indicates the
importance of level of study for defining the notion of entrepreneur. The
question is therefore: What would be the consequences for the study of selecting
a certain level? A concentrated discussion of entrepreneurship theory forming
the basis for each level is needed to guide the selection.

5

Being also a Ph.D. in physics, Bygrave could make comparisons, and as a contrast show that
modern physics is firmly based on a tradition with theory developed from the 17th century.
6 Low & Macmillan (1988) compared the notion of entrepreneurship with that of leadership,
which is considered by e.g. Pfeffer too broad to be distinguished from other concepts of social
influence.
7 In the literature you can see variations. For example van de Ven, Hudson & Schroeder (1984)
in studying 14 educational software start-ups' performance used three levels: entrepreneurial
(individual), organizational and ecological (industry as a whole).
8 See e.g. Aldrich & Auster (1986) who studied new and small organizations versus large and
old from both organization and population (society) level.

<-----Page 19----->20

2. 2. 2 The Entrepreneur from a Societal Perspective
The entrepreneur in society and in its development is a focus of interest which
we have already met in the beginning of this chapter. The economists Cantillon,
Say, the microeconomists, Schumpeter and Kirzner all took a primary interest in
how entrepreneurs contribute to the functioning of society as a whole.
Entrepreneurship is seen as a function or a role, which together with other
functions or roles have different implications for society. Typical study areas
with a focus on entrepreneurship in society are how entrepreneurship contributes
to growth in the economy, the role of entrepreneurship in society, the importance
of the social context for entrepreneurship, how entrepreneurship affects values,
norms and traditions in society, and how entrepreneurship contributes to
knowledge development in society. Entrepreneurship in this perspective has in
the Western hemisphere since 30 years been interesting for society' s policymaking concerning business start-up as a vehicle towards economic expansion
and employment. Public administrations have engaged researchers to study how
the founding and expansion of enterprises can be promoted.
A societal perspective applied to our study would mean that the
individual business start-up and early development came outside the focus, since
the perspective entails a generalised view on the actors, seen as a function or role
in society. How trust develops in action processes would mainly be outside of
the study.

2. 2. 3 The Entrepreneur from a Clustered Enterprise
Perspective
Studies regarding the entrepreneur from a clustered enterprise perspective
concern sub-sets of society, e.g. a region, a type of business such as
manufacturing, or an industry. The perspective takes its origin from a view of the
sub-set as an entity and the enterprises within the sub-set as units. Typical issues
of a focus on entrepreneurship in a clustered enterprise perspective may be for
example how entrepreneurship contributes to growth in the industry, or the role
of entrepreneurship in knowledge intensive enterprises. Entrepreneurship on
industry level has been studied using the institutional approach and also using
the population ecology approach.
Aldrich & Fiol (1994) used an institutional approach to study the
constraints facing entrepreneurs in emerging industries, i.e. in the founding of

<-----Page 20----->21

whole industries. Aspects of the entrepreneurs' legitimacy outside and inside the
emerging industry were discussed. Strategies that founders can pursue for
legitimacy to evolve from innovative ventures to broader contexts were
identified, collectively reshaping industry and institutional environments. There
are some obvious parallels in purpose between their study and this one, but also
some main differences. The individual entrepreneur is in Aldrich & Fiol (1994)
seen as part of a group within the industry, external actors are groups in
collective roles in the industry's environment. Their study also takes an interest
in new industries more than specific new ventures.
Hannan & Freeman (1977) applied the population ecology model,
originating from biology and developed by Campbell (1969), as a metaphor for
organisation fit and survival. The study was based on their main question: Why
do so many kinds of organisations exist? The first stage in the natural selection
process is the occurrence of variations of organisations, planned or unplanned.
Instead of genetic processes there are learning processes (Aldrich & Pfeffer,
1976). The second stage is the operation of selection criteria that select individuals, i.e. those organisations survive that are consistent with the selection
criteria. The third step involves a retention mechanism, by which selected
organisations are preserved, duplicated or reproduced - once again the learning
process and memory system function as means for recalling positively selected
responses in the future. In this way enterprises and industries will be developed
over time. They survive or not, those that fit best develop and may become
models for others. Apart from Hannan & Freeman a number of researchers have
used this metaphor-based model to study births of enterprises, often based on
statistical data (see further an overview in Tucker, Singh & Meinhard, 1990).
To see trust between entrepreneur and external actors using a clustered
enterprise perspective entails a generalised view of the actors, seen as a function
or role in a larger setting. In this way it resembles the societal perspective above.
But at the same time trust as a phenomenon pertinent to industry norms, types of
products could be studied. But studies using this perspective do not - or to a
lesser extent - account for the individual variation between enterprises and
specific actors.

2. 2. 4 The Entrepreneur from an Enterprise-as-Entity
Perspective
In business administration research there is a long tradition of seeing the
enterprise as one entity and studying what the enterprise does in the market, how

<-----Page 21----->22

it competes or co-operates with other enterprises. You can say that the enterprise
in this perspective is handled as an individual and acts in relation to other
enterprises, seen as other individuals. The enterprise is on this level of analysis
assumed to be uniform, and as an entity it gets certain characteristics. To see the
enterprise as a uniform entity has a number of analytical advantages. The most
important one is making it possible to handle several enterprises in the same
analysis without getting overwhelmed by data.
Another tradition in business administration is to identify and study
functional areas within enterprises: marketing, finance, control, management etc.
Similar functional areas exist in most or all enterprises, so studies can concern
one functional area and encompass several enterprises or just one enterprise,
using knowledge and earlier research experience concerning that same functional
area. The very reason for defining functional areas is in itself functional specialisation of research, i.e. a need or just a desire among researchers to develop
specific knowledge.
This perspective in research concerning business start-up leads to
research issues such as: What is typical for business start-ups, what factors make
them develop, and how resources, planning, production, distribution etc. are
handled in business start-ups. Key success factors and entry strategies that enable
the business start-up to survive and develop is an area attracting interest for
studies (cf. Vesper, 1990). E.g. Sandberg & Hofer (1987) have in a contingency
approach studied the interaction of personal, environmental and strategic
variables on performance of new ventures.
In the perspective of the enterprise as an entity it is seen as created,
growing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes revitalised and sometimes dying. The
organisational life cycle is a metaphor based on the biological life cycle of
organisms and it is assumed that there is an isomorphic relationship between
biological and social or organisational phenomena (Kimberly & Miles, 1980).
This relationship might stimulate new views, new research questions and bring
focus to observations that would else pass by unnoticed. In this way it can open
up for new findings.9 In the words of Kimberly & Miles (1980) the biological
metaphor "can force theorists to think through carefully where the metaphors are
appropriate and inappropriate, their use can lead to the raising of new important
questions and perhaps to the recasting of old ones" (p. 9). Some well-known life
cycle models have been presented by Adizes (1988), Churchill & Lewis (1983),
Cooper (1981), Greiner (1972), Katz & Gartner (1988), Kimberly & Miles
(1980), and Quinn & Cameron (1983). Common to them is that stages in the life
9

See e.g. Norén (1995) for a discussion on the use of metaphors in general.

<-----Page 22----->23

cycle are discussed and named or defined, characteristics of each stage are stated
and discussed, and explicitly or implicitly the researcher discusses the findings in
terms of generality.
Trust can be studied as a central issue in the enterprise as an entity
perspective. On the other hand the new venture as it emerges, particularly during
start-up, is characterised very much by the entrepreneur in person (Birley &
Norburn, 1985, p. 82). Trust may therefore very much be connected to one or
more specific persons. Also trust in and from some external actors may be
personal and not characteristics of the specific organisation or function within it.
So there is an element of individual perspective in our research issues concerning
trust.

2. 2. 5 The Entrepreneur from an Individual
Perspective
The characteristics of the entrepreneur and traits in the entrepreneurial
personality have attracted considerable interest, particularly among scholars with
background in psychology. The main issue is: Who is the entrepreneur? How
entrepreneurs differ from non-entrepreneurs and motivational forces for the
entrepreneur are other common issues.
In 1948 Arthur H. Cole at Harvard University established the Center of
Entrepreneurial History at Harvard. The centre advocated the need for research
into motivation forces and characteristics of the entrepreneur (Cole, 1968). The
Harvard studies have been famous primarily through David C. McClelland,
whose book The Achieving Society (1961), has been very influential in the area
throughout the years. McClelland's research was based on the concept of a "need
for achievement" (n Ach). He characterised the individuals with high n Ach as
those preferring to be personally responsible for solving problems, setting goals,
and reaching those goals by their own efforts. Such persons have a strong desire
to know how well they are accomplishing their tasks. In his studies he
investigated relationships between n Ach and behaviour, e.g. risk-taking.
McClelland has been followed by a large number of researchers in a similar
direction (see overviews in e.g. Brockhaus, 1982; Davidsson, 1989; Wärneryd,
1988).
A responsible individual who does not believe that the outcome of a
business venture will be influenced by his own efforts is unlikely to expose
himself to risky business efforts. The potential entrepreneur's perception of a
situation influences her/his decision to start a business. This is the view behind

<-----Page 23----->24

Rotter's (1966) "locus-of-control"-theory, which implies that an individual
perceives the outcome of an event as being within (called internal locus-ofcontrol) or beyond (called external locus-of-control) her/his personal control and
understanding. Rotter and his followers have studied whether individuals with
internal belief would more likely strive for achievement than would individuals
with external beliefs.
A typical denominator for studies of entrepreneurs (individuals) is
motivation (Wärneryd, 1988), personal values: (e.g. Hornaday and Aboud,
1971), creativity, self-confidence, needs for independence or autonomy,
conformity, adaptiveness to change (Sexton & Bowman, 1986). Entrepreneurs'
growth-orientation is often studied (e.g. Cooper & Dunkelberg, 1986;
Davidsson, 1989), comparisons are made of the path to entrepreneurship
(inheritance, purchase, start-up) with background attitudes characteristic of
entrepreneurs. Some researchers have used personality traits to identify different
entrepreneurial types and have sometimes also created typologies. In that vein
Stanworth & Curran (1976) identified three types: the Artisan, who wants an independent type of work to make a product of high quality; the Classical, who
aims at traditional profit maximisation; and the Manager, who wants status and
security and often has inherited the enterprise.
A personality trait that has attracted attention in the last two decades is the
entrepreneur's tolerance for ambiguity, i.e. her/his ability to work in perceived
vague and unclear business conditions. This has been studied by e.g. Johannisson
(1992), Schere (1982), and Sexton & Bowman (1986). Effects of the individual's
previous business or professional experience is an issue that has attracted much
attention, not least for its start-up policy-making relevance: Is the potential
entrepreneur "pulled" or "pushed" into a start-up? Pull is an independent own
decision, while push is by force for reasons such as unemployment (Cooper &
Dunkelberg, 1987). Do the entrepreneurs have role models? Do they have
personal contacts in the profession or industry, such as businessmen with
experience from start-ups? There are numerous such studies. A well-known
classical study to determine age, education, birth, country and similar
characteristics is Collins, Moore & Unwalla (1964): The Enterprising Man, an
empirical study of 150 successful entrepreneurs. The authors see the
entrepreneur in a Freudian psycho-analytical perspective and discuss background
characteristics and performance as entrepreneur.
In sum, the perspective of the entrepreneur from an individual perspective
implies a focus on the traits and characteristics or experience of the person. As
we discussed in the preceding chapter the start-up and early development of a
new venture is performed by the entrepreneur and by external actors providing

<-----Page 24----->25

resources to the new venture. That is to say, not only the entrepreneur but also
the interplay between the actors form the development of the new venture.
Important actors around the entrepreneur must therefore also be focused, not
only the entrepreneur. The present study needs a perspective allowing the study
of this interplay.

2. 2. 6 The Entrepreneur from an Individual-inContext Perspective
Research concerning the individual entrepreneur may, as we have seen above,
include a research interest of the entrepreneur and her/his personal experience
and situation. This opens up for a view on the importance of the individual
entrepreneur in her/his context. Low & Macmillan (1988) mean that
psychological studies that focus on the entrepreneur in a context will be useful.
Schein (1983) asked: How do the entrepreneurs/founders of organisations create
organisational cultures? Organisational culture is the pattern of basic
assumptions that a given group has invented, discovered or developed in learning
to cope with problems of external adaptations and internal integration. In his
article the entrepreneur's personality is central for shaping the new organisation
and building culture. Still, his study has the entrepreneur in focus and the context
is mirrored in the entrepreneurial personality.
But instead of asking who is the entrepreneur, one could ask: What does
the entrepreneur do to accomplish something, e.g. to start a new business? Others
involved, what do they do? How does the entrepreneur influence the
accomplishment, e.g. a business created? That is entrepreneurial behaviour or
action. Instead of traits or characteristics the process becomes central. The
organisation is shaped in and by the process. Not only the entrepreneur but also
other people involved will then become interesting. There are often unclear
boundaries between the entrepreneur and others involved in the process, hence
both individual and organisation (as a number of people connected) need to be
studied. This approach views the creation of an organisation as a contextual
event, the outcome of many influences. The action view of entrepreneurship
places the entrepreneur within the process of new venture creation performing a
series of actions that result in the creation of a new organisation (Gartner, 1988).
Entrepreneurial action along the lines outlined in this section has a
shorter study history. There are some researchers who view entrepreneurship as
organising (Weick, 1979), and the formation of the organisation as a
fundamentally enacted phenomenon, a socially constructed reality (Berger &

<-----Page 25----->26

Luckmann, 1966) in an equivocal situation. The network approach to studying
business formation assumes that the key to successful entrepreneurship is to be
found in the ability to develop and maintain a personal network (Aldrich &
Zimmer, 1986; Birley, 1985; Johannisson, 1988). Aldrich & Zimmer (1986)
view the entrepreneurial process as embedded in a shifting network of
continuing social relations that facilitates and constrains linkages between
entrepreneurs, resources and opportunities. Birley (1985) in studying the role of
network in the founding of 160 new firms differentiated between two kinds of
networks: informal (family, friends) and formal (banks, accountants, lawyers,
promoting agents). Johannisson (1988) discussed context and boundaryspanning which concerns the small business' need to use resources outside itself
to reach its aims; a problem less prominent for the large business with specialists
and different resources inside its organisation. The main condition for required
action, mutual commitment, is supplied by the entrepreneur's social network and
its ties between the entrepreneur and family, friends, relatives, business
colleagues, customers, suppliers etc. Mentors and role models are important.
Both Birley (1985) and Johannisson (1988) see the local anchorage of the
network as important for business start-up. The network must also be able to
channel both information and influence, i.e. it must include both strong and weak
ties (Granovetter, 1973).
The perspective of individual-in-context encompasses the view of
interplay between entrepreneurs and other actors in a process, which will allow
studies of trust development in action and over time. Further consequences are
discussed as conclusions in the following section.

2. 3 Conclusions for the Study: The
Entrepreneur in Context and a
Process View
In the preceding section five different perspectives on the entrepreneur in theory
were identified and discussed with the aim of establishing the most fruitful
perspective for the study. The individual-in-context perspective brings focus
both to the entrepreneur and to actors around the new venture. In this perspective
there is also earlier research carried out to give a foundation to the view of new
venture creation as organising in action processes. At the same time this research
has opened up a view of actors' sensemaking, which can give this study a frame
of reference concerning why actors act, their construction of meaning, and trust

<-----Page 26----->27

as meaning. The next two chapters will elaborate this framework further. Before
that we will conclude with assumptions and definitions for the study concerning
the entrepreneur, the context and the process view.

2. 3. 1 Definition of Entrepreneur for the Present
Study
In the literature survey above in this chapter one theme has been the variety of
views between writers. Nevertheless, there seems to be little divergence in views
of the entrepreneur as a person when the notion is used for a business starter.
Theory in this line can be summarised that the entrepreneur is the founderowner-manager (alone or with other entrepreneurs) of a business start-up. There
are different foci on the entrepreneur's characteristics, but one common
characteristic can be labelled as dedication or commitment to the business startup, to be the owner of the business and to the work entailed. Therefore this study
will define the entrepreneur as the founder-owner-manager (alone or with other
entrepreneurs) of a business start-up and to have three commitments. All three
commitments should be fulfilled for a person to be considered as an
entrepreneur.
Commitment means that the entrepreneur is willing to and actually does
undertake a considerable effort to succeed with the business start-up. Start
commitment implies that the entrepreneur him/herself or together with other
entrepreneurs has taken the initiative that aims at a new business venture.
Initiative means that a person takes the first step or makes the introductory
moves. The entrepreneur starting a new venture is generally legally owner and at
the same time manager (Steiner, 1990). When the firm grows, i.e. is not any
more an emerging organisation, and becomes more complicated to operate
internally, Steiner (1990) found that new managers, often with no ownership,
come into the play. So the concept of entrepreneur can in this study assume
ownership commitment to be central for the emerging enterprise. Generally
business starters also provide owner's capital (often along with other sources of
finance). The importance of owner's capital may vary between different
industries according to capital needs for activities. The provision of owner's
capital implies two things: 1) the owner bears some risk of personal financial
loss in case of failure, and 2) being capital provider the owner has specific rights
concerning the firm, more than e.g. an employee not providing owner's capital.
More risk and more rights characterises the situation with provision of owner's
capital. In the definition above is included a work commitment, i.e. to manage

<-----Page 27----->28

and actively work with the business start-up makes a difference from a situation
with detached ownership. I other words: The person's occupation and
professional role is at stake.
The notion of entrepreneur and entrepreneurship is often also used to
denote change, renewal and development within existing enterprises (e.g.
Corporate Entrepreneurship, Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990; Intrapreneurship,
Pinchot, 1985). Trust concerning new business ventures emerging and remaining
within established firms is not covered in the study. Excluded is also trust
concerning business ventures that are by the entrepreneur considered as
temporary or short-lived. The study is concentrated on new ventures important
for making a living more permanently. At least one entrepreneur should work
full-time with the new venture after start-up.

2. 3. 2 The Entrepreneur and Context
In the discussion of the perspectives above the notion of context has been used,
but it has still not been clarified. Context and environment are notions used by
different writers. During the last few decades the relationships between an
organisation and its environment have been discussed extensively in the
literature. Burns & Stalker (1961) introduced the contingency perspective on
organisations, which takes on different structures depending on the character of
the environment. The environment, although discussed, seems less often to be
defined. To quote Buckley (1967, p. 62):
The environment, however else it may be characterized, can be seen as an ensemble of
more or less distinguishable elements, states, or events, whether these discriminations are
made in terms of spatial or temporary relations' properties.

"More or less distinguishable elements, states or events" and "spatial or
temporary relations' properties" is a rather unlimited definition. It also represents
well how the term environment actually has been used. A definition intended to
cover all aspects of a wide and indistinct phenomenon will inevitably become
vague. With the sensemaking view for this study, it is natural to see not only a
multitude of different relations between a focal entrepreneur and external actors,
but also that these relations differ over time and situations. For any specific
action process, at any point of time and by a specific focal actor, e.g. the
entrepreneur, a part of the general environment is enacted. This part will or may
be active in forming the action process. This part of the general environment will

<-----Page 28----->29

be called the context. The organising context is a structure between the
individual entrepreneur/new venture and the wider environment (Johannisson,
1988). The context can in the study be defined as: Environment, enacted in an
action process by a focal actor at a specific point of time. The context in an
action process can vary
- for one actor over time, and
- between actors, at a specific point of time.

<-----Page 29----->30

2. 3. 3 Entrepreneurship in a Process View
The notion of process has been used above in connection with the entrepreneur
in individual-in-context perspective. As yet it has not been discussed and
clarified as to its implications. This will be done in this section by contrasting a
structural vs. processual view of entrepreneurship. A structure is a configuration
of parts, and structural description is a characterisation of the way the
components in a set are interrelated (Hernes, 1976, p. 518). A structural view is
to see the character of phenomena as stable, static, unchanging in time and place.
The notion of structure implies stability or constancy as a predominant feature,
while a process is a series of actions, operations or motions involved in the
accomplishment of an end (Merriam-Webster Thesaurus, 1991, p. 466).
Similarly, Stymne (1970, p. 35) defines process as:
a number of interrelated activities extended in time. An activity is seen as the behavior of
an individual at a given point in time.

A processual perspective is to see a phenomenon as changing, streaming,
flowing. The phenomenon will be different over time and place. The notion of
process implies instability. The phenomenon is undergoing changes, movement.
A process is a sequence of events, different appearances are bound together.
Dynamics is a predominant feature: Inherent power and forces produce motion
and change. According to Buckley (1967, p. 18):
the process model views society as a complex, multifacetted, fluid interplay of widely
varying degrees in intensities of association and dissociation.

The dichotomised description of structure and process above needs to be
qualified, since there are links combining the views rather than definite
contradictions. A stable structure can be seen as a process in equilibrium
(Hernes, 1976, p. 520), the equilibrium can be more or less temporary. That is to
say: Conditions governing structure are processual or a combination of
processual and structural. Stymne (1970, p. 39) discusses on similar lines:
Structural or environmental characteristics elicit processes leading to structures.
Still the researcher can in her/his view emphasise either constancy, change or
both regarding a structure. If change is emphasised the structure can be seen as
the output or the distribution of results, which Hernes (1976, p. 519) calls an
output structure.

<-----Page 30----->31

In a description of a complicated phenomenon, there is often the need for
economising on information conveyed to the recipient/reader. To describe a
complex process over time, with many actors and other intervening
circumstances can imply a mass of information and loss of overview of
important phenomena. A structural description is advantageous here since it can
easily be based on logic and parsimony. And a process can be described in
structural form. Hernes (1976, p. 519) defines what he calls process structure as
"a specification of the logical form of the process generating the result".
A phenomenon like entrepreneurship can be viewed in terms of structure
and process. In fact, most of the schools, directions and studies discussed above
display a conscious stance in this respect. The view of structure is inherent in the
personal trait and characteristics type of research. It is assumed that clear-cut
types of characteristics can be identified. It is further assumed that the
characteristics cause something else that can also be defined, success for
example. These factors are assumed to be stable as factors. Once they are defined
and operationalised and relationships discovered they can be applied in future
studies and values compared. New factors can be included, but on the whole
progress in knowledge is based on stabilised structures. The critique within this
line of thought often implies that intended structures have not been established.
Some researchers take on the view that the personality is a structure but
processes in the environment have an impact, e.g. entrepreneurial motivation is
affected by the person's earlier experience. The traditional view of the enterprise
as an organisational entity or its functional division is clearly structural in its
basis. Processes may change structure though. Change may or may not be
prominent in the view, i.e. the structural forms of the enterprise may be more or
less the result of processes, more or less permanent due to impact of processes
involved.
The individual-in-context study perspective is generally process-oriented.
There seem to be two underlying views of the role of process. One is to focus on
the process as important and at the same time work towards structural aims:
establish structured models or theories out of the processual findings. Schein
(1983) and Aldrich & Zimmer (1986) seem to follow this line of research. The
views of the organisational life cycle and population ecology are rather similar in
this discussion. The researchers see the enterprise as a process, developing from
birth to death. In the definitions of stages and common characteristics for
enterprises, properties take on structural forms. These function as a means of
economised description.
The second process-oriented view of entrepreneurship - organising and
formation of the organisation as a fundamentally enacted phenomenon, i.e. as a

<-----Page 31----->32

socially constructed reality - seems to consider the study of processes as a
research issue per se (e.g. Gartner, 1985, 1988; Van de Ven & Polley, 1992).
The socially constructed reality presumes changes, streams and flows in action
processes. Complex processes - as they normally are seen to be - will often be
depicted in structural form.10
The process view will suit the needs of this study to capture the
development of business start-up and early development, due to the inherent
character of change, sequence of events and, to a large extent, instability. It can
also be added that time is an important issue (Bird, 1992) underlying actions and
events as well as sequences of action. Time will emerge in process studies (Van
de Ven & Polley, 1992). In this predominantly processual view, structural
elements may be important to identify. Results from the study may take on
structural forms (cf. the notion of process structure; Hernes, 1976).
To sum up, this concluding section has set the line for frame of reference
for the study in three ways. First, the three commitments constituting the
entrepreneur have been an argument concerning e.g. the selection of cases. The
business starters in the cases should display three entrepreneurial commitments:
start, ownership and work commitment. Second, external actors should be
focused in accordance with the notion of context, i.e. those made sense by the
entrepreneur. Third, the process view opens up for studying the business start-up
and early development as action processes. Fundamental behind all this is the
view of sensemaking governing the organising of the new venture. This
fundamental view will be further elaborated in the following chapter.

See for example Gartner's (1985) organizing model of "diamond type" with the four concepts
(variables) of Individual, Environment, Process and Organization.

Chapter 3

Action Processes and
Sensemaking
3. 1 Organising in Action Processes
The discussion in section 2.3.3 concerning the characteristics of structure and
process is applicable to the term "organisation". In Webster's Dictionary there are
two main definitions, each with two variants. One definition is "association,
society; an administrative and functional structure (as a business or a political
party)" (1976, p. 594). The second definition is "act or process of organising or
of being organised; condition or manner of being organised".11 In the first set of
definitions the word "organisation" is a noun denoting structure with permanence, stability and a more or less definite state. "Organisation" is conceived
as an object to which fixed properties are assigned. Sometimes organisation is
not even seen as an object but is an object, e.g. "the organisation is flexible and
smooth, well adapted to its environment and capable of adjustment". When an
abstract concept becomes used as if it referred to a thing (reification), there is
always the risk of e.g. conclusions more relevant to the thing than for the original
concept - and the phenomenon the concept denotes. Abstract, structural
phenomena can easily in people's mind take on the object's properties. Dynamics
in a setting may then be underestimated.
When conditions in the environment change, objects and social systems
will change, but in different ways; when an object no longer suits your needs,
you normally simply discard it and acquire a new one. A social system is not
discarded, it usually changes itself to comply with new circumstances. A social
system normally takes part actively in its own change, whereas an object is
changed by activities outside itself, passively. "Organisation" as reification can
e.g. hamper needs to change by evoking passiveness.
According to Hernes (1976) a stable structure can be seen as a process in
equilibrium (cf. section 2.3.3), where the equilibrium can be more or less
temporary. Here one part of the second definition comes into the picture. A
11

The definitions represent two ways of seeing definitions: ostensive versus performative as
discussed by Czarniawska-Joerges (1994).

<-----Page 33----->34

process leads to the state of being organised. By change a shift occurs over to
another state: the new organisation, assuming new permanence and stability.
But the second definition also covers what has in section 2.3.3 been
discussed as the process view. "The act or process of organising" links the notion
of process to organising. Weick (1979) builds his process view on the verb
organising. A verb denotes movement, change, streams and flows. Just as nouns
easily can be connected to structure, verbs imply process: Transformation
occurs, events are connected, somebody does something. In the words of Weick
(1979): "Streams, flows and changes are the essence of what managers manage"
(p. 42), i.e. often initiated or run by people. Using verbs when studying what
happens in an organisation means focusing on people and what they do.
Czarniawska-Joerges (1994) thus distinguishes between organisation as being or
doing. Verbs bind together sequences of events and give a picture of what
happens over time (and sometimes also spatially). Transformation from one
point of time to another will automatically become highlighted. Finally, verbs
often denote acting. Action of people will be in focus. People will be noticed for
what they do, as actors. Actors and actions change one event to the next.
Sequences of action can be identified. Organising is doing things in a flow:
Processes contain individual behavior that are interlocked between two or more people.
The behaviours of one person are contingent on the behaviors of another person (Weick,
1979, p. 89).

Patterns of on-going action-reaction will emerge: An action by A can evoke a
specific response from B, which is then responded to by A. Regular patterns of
"interacts" will be established forming action processes (Weick, 1979, p. 89). A
person does not invest all interacts in one single group; interacts will occur with
several groups. One or several interacts enacted by an actor to reach an
outcome will in this study be labelled an action process. This definition implies
that any action process will be personally conceived by every actor involved for
the reasons that desired outcomes may differ.
The Weickian notion of outcome is used in this study. Outcomes will be
continuously constructed and reconstructed as part of meaning development. In
this view, organising is not necessarily governed by clearly specified goals as in
the main stance in classical analytical decision theory (cf. Enderud, 1976).
Instead, explicitly stated goals may be formulated in retrospect, which means
that unfolding action precedes goals. Van de Ven & Polley (1992) studied trialand-error learning during the development of a technological innovation by an
interorganisational joint venture. They found that the principal actors' outcome

<-----Page 34----->35

criteria shifted over time and appeared to reflect the dominant concerns of
managers and investors at different points of time along the innovation journey.
The goals themselves were reconstructed to redirect the innovation. People
adjusted what they wanted to come out of action to the unfolding of action
processes. Thus, the notion of outcome as a meaning is subjective, personally
interpreted and time-bound. Action processes and actors' sensemaking are
intertwined.

3. 2 Sensemaking
Chapter 1 briefly presented the view that emerging organisations face an
equivocal reality (Gartner et al., 1992; Weick, 1979). The entrepreneur meets an
abundance of information, possible to use for different and alternative ways to
act. The information may be not unclear in itself, instead it gives room for
different ways to act, where the entrepreneur often must make choices based on
values, priorities and clarity of preferences (Weick, 1995, p. 27).
The abundance of information is a problematic situation, which the
entrepreneur has to convert to a possibility that can be acted upon to reach
something desired. This conversion of the problematic situation into a possibility
to be acted upon is done by the entrepreneur's sensemaking of reality.
Sensemaking refers to people's concern with making sense of events and
experience. It is a process where they attempt to construct meaningful
explanations for situations and their experiences within those situations.
Sensemaking thus entails intricate (and often unconscious) processes such as
attending, comparing, attributing, relating, reflecting and retaining (Gioia, 1986,
p. 61). The basic view behind sensemaking is that the human mind constructs or
invents meaning out of complicated settings rather than seeing or responding to a
world of meaning that is objectively there.
Sensemaking can be defined as the reciprocal interaction of information
seeking and meaning construction with action (cf. Thomas, Clark & Gioia, 1993,
p. 240). The expression "information seeking" has also to be seen in the light of
conditions of equivocality, where seeking can be both systematic, unsystematic
and mixed. People engage in ascribing or imposing meaning upon experience
including their own actions and use the imposed meaning as a basis for
subsequent understanding and action (Gioia, 1986, p. 50). Meaning created
influences action taken. And, reciprocally, action taken also influences meaning.
There are for this study important characteristics of the sensemaking view

<-----Page 35----->36

concerning how people construct meaning. The notions of sensemaking and
meaning construction seem to be used by different writers with little or no
difference (Weick, 1995, p. 69). In this study meaning and meaning construction
is used in a more narrow sense as can be seen from the sensemaking definition
above.
Just like action, the notion of behaviour also denotes what people do but
behaviour has no connection with sensemaking. In traditional behavioural
research you observe behaviour and maybe measure connections between stimuli
and response, but you do not interpret motives and intentions (meaning).
Behaviour is primarily associated with the questions of what and how. Action is
in the view of this study closely linked to the question of why.

3. 2. 1 Sensemaking is Both Individual and Social
Sensemaking will be personal in that people use intuition, imagination, vision,
revelatory flashes of insight, and creative problem solving in the construction
and use of meaning (cf. Gioia, 1986, p. 64). Sensemaking will also be contingent
upon the personal experience, professional competence and abilities. The
personal element in sensemaking is one reason why two persons "see" different
things in the same problem setting and based on that act differently. This is
fundamental to entrepreneurship and pervades some of the entrepreneurship
research as we have seen it in chapter 2, particularly what we have labelled the
individual-in-context perspective.
At the same time, human thinking and social functioning are essential
aspects of one another (Weick, 1995, p. 38). This is also relevant for
organisations, as expressed by Burns & Stalker (1961, p. 118) :
In working organizations decisions are made either in the presence of others or with the
knowledge that they will have to be implemented, or understood, or approved by others.
The set of considerations called into relevance on any decision-making occasion has
therefore to be one shared with others or acceptable to them.

The entrepreneur's sensemaking will not only be individual but social,
including external actors. Information seeking is done in conjunction with others.
Meaning is sought individually but may also emerge in communication
involving others. Action generally is made possible or constrained by others
taking part in it. The entrepreneur's sensemaking becomes a blend of influence
from her/his own mind and that of others.

<-----Page 36----->37

Does the individual and social sensemaking imply shared meanings
between the entrepreneur and external actors? Does a specific situation with two
actors in which sensemaking occurs also imply that equivalent meanings are
attributed by actors for joint action to occur? It is not necessary for people to
agree on ends to act collectively. Although they may not share meanings, they do
share experiences (Weick, 1995, p. 188). They can actually pursue different ends
for quite different reasons, still, they can agree on means and initiate common
action. Partners may
share space, time and energy, but they need not share visions, aspirations, or intentions.
The sharing comes much later if it ever comes at all (Weick, 1979, p. 91).

Business exchange means for a buyer acquisition of goods or recieving a service,
whereas for the seller it means inflow of money. A loan from the bank may mean
business start-up for the entrepreneur and for the bank it means revenue on
provided capital, qualified by a certain calculated risk. If the amount of money
and conditions on the loan make sense for both parties action is elicited, but
conjunct sensemaking may be restricted to the situation at hand. In both cases
outcome differs between the involved actors, consequently they enact differences
in coherence of interacts, i.e. action processes.

3. 2. 2 Sensemaking the Environment
Smircich & Stubbart (1985) distinguish between three ways of seeing the
environment: objective, perceived and enacted. In e.g. mainstream business
strategy research, environment is something that exists "out there", just to be
recognised. A focal organisation can discover and map the environment. Anyone
who investigates the environment of a specific organisation will find the same
environment. Then research often proceeds to find the fit between organisation
and environment. The environment is objective.
The problem is that the environment normally is complex, composed of
many different organisations. Man's ability to discover and map is limited, and
discovery depends on what you perceive. Due to various perceptions, people will
find different extensions and compositions of one organisation's environment.
For example, an investigation's result is contingent upon the researcher's
perception. But still there is one objective environment, so the investigation
problem is to overcome the "filter" imposed by human perception. The
environment is perceived.

<-----Page 37----->38

But if you start looking at environment from the viewpoint of a person in
an organisation, (or an entrepreneur in business start-up) s/he may pose questions
like the following: What organisations or people could be useful for us now or in
the future? For this and that specific purpose, who has interesting information for
us? In future contingencies, who could bring us support? The answer to these
questions will differ depending on the person giving the answers just as
discussed above concerning perception. But there is not a finite and precise
number of organisations and people enabling an objective answer. It is
dependent on how the person interprets the questions, what will be considered as
important features to observe and also her/his imagination. Bringing answers
also implies action, using e.g. personal network to tap information from
(Johannisson, 1988) and intellectual efforts to make sense out of these actions.
The person enacts the environment: S/he produces the part of environment faced,
what in section 2.3.2 was labelled context. The enacted environment is
subjectively constructed, built by personalised experience and open to multiple
interpretation. Three strands of research meet in this view: interpretative
sociology (Schütz, 1967), sociology of knowledge (Berger & Luckmann, 1967)
and cognitive social psychology (Weick, 1979).
The notion of enacted environment is important concerning business startup and early development. The entrepreneur often lacks own resources and has
to make use of resources provided by others (see e.g. Stevenson & Gumpert,
1985; Macmillan, 1983).12 It is vital to enact possibilities and not to be
constrained by a precise notion of enterprise boundaries. The environment can be
enacted to extend enterprise boundaries by creating actors outside the enterprise,
who act for the enterprise. A broad network of contacts widens the enactable
environment by social construction and may increase viability of action.13

3. 2. 3 Sensemaking Concerns the Future but Tends to
Retrospective

be

Sensemaking concerns outcomes lying ahead and action to come. The future is
equivocal, though. Entrepreneurs need to reduce the abundance of information
by meaning in order to act (Gartner et al., 1992). But there can be many possible
meanings for a person in one situation and a multitude of clues for information
seeking. Clues are often sought in the past. When people contemplate future
12

Brytting (1991) thus used the term "hitch-hiking", and Lindqvist (1991) "piggy-backing" for
making use of another company's market organisation.
13 Cf. the notion of "strength of weak ties" by Granovetter (1973).

<-----Page 38----->39

action they think about it as if it has already occurred to be able to make sense of
the intended outcomes. So what one has experienced earlier can - consciously or
not - be a way to non-equivocality. We therefore often attend to new situations as
if they were earlier experienced situations, in Weick's words retrospective
sensemaking (1979, p. 194-201; 1995, p. 24). The idea of retrospective
sensemaking derives from Schütz's analysis of "the meaning of lived experience"
(1967, p. 73). Creation of meaning is an attentional process focusing on what has
already occurred. The past is singled out to guide the present and the future. "The
meaning of lived experience" also highlights the individual aspect of
sensemaking: life experience. Even if the entrepreneur is new as a business
starter the whole impact of experience from education and training, earlier
positions in work life etc. will be important for retrospective sensemaking. But
retrospective sensemaking can at the same time be prospective by using
experience that specifies meaningful occurrences in advance of their happening
(Gioia, 1986, p. 63). Retrospectiveness resides in basic values and beliefs of a
person and experience, stored in memory as patterns called interpretive schemes.

3. 2. 4 Basic Values and Beliefs
Basic values and beliefs pervade the individual's assumptions about the nature of
the world, the role their organisation will play in society, the nature of human
beings, truth, relationships, time and space (Schein, 1983, p. 17). Johansson
Lindfors (1989) in a study of small business managers categorised personal
values found into existential ideas, work ethics, conception of human relations,
conceptions of power, and conceptions of human work. Basic values are rooted
in the person's previous experience and stable over time.14 The bearer can be
more or less conscious of her/his basic values. Basic values, even when they are
less conscious to the bearer, become expressed in beliefs, assumptions and ideas.
Beliefs as rooted in basic values are also stable over time but nevertheless more
influenced by meaning construction and reconstruction and may therefore
change and develop more than basic values. Attention and action performed may
reconstruct meaning and, by that, change beliefs.
Implicit or explicit basic values and beliefs will form and activate the
individual's construction of meaning (Weick, 1995, p. 146). Through meaning
they also have an impact on attention, interpretive schemes and action. In the
14 Basic values as a concept is approximately equivalent to what in anthropologial literature is
called dominant value orientation, cf. Schein (1992, p. 21).

<-----Page 39----->40

words of Brunsson (1982, p. 30): "Ideologies (= set of ideas) that are conclusive,
complex and consistent can provide a good basis for action, in that they solve a
good deal of choice problems". The choice problem, indicated in the quotation,
is the interplay of basic values and beliefs with construction and reconstruction
of meaning.
Basic values and beliefs are primarily individual, but may also be
common in groups. Shared meaning development may result in shared beliefs.

3. 2. 5 Interpretive Schemes
People develop ways of economising on information and to lessen the task of
handling the myriad of potentially meaningful clues for action available (Gioia
1986, p. 55). This choice problem is difficult and laborious, so people need to
simplify. From earlier occasions they use experience that has been stored in
memory, and is brought forward again. Structured, pre-existing knowledge is
used to interpret the situation and generate appropriate action. These
representations are given various names in the literature: "blueprints",
"interpretive schemes", "schemas", "scripts", "patterns", "templates", "cause
maps" and "theories" (See for example Weick, 1979 and Gioia, 1986, for concept investigations). Here the notions of interpretive scheme and scheme will be
used as synonyms denoting structured sets of pre-existing views, and patterns of
events/actions that can contribute to meaning and action.
Lord & Foti (1986, p. 23) differentiate between four types of schemes
giving a picture of different ways for schemes to function. A self-scheme
contains information about the scheme-holder him-/herself: personality,
appearance, and behaviour. A person scheme focuses on the trait and behaviour
information common to certain groups or types of people. Knowledge about
"entrepreneurs" as a prototype is an example. Event scheme (script) describes the
typical or appropriate sequences of events or activities in a particular situation. It
possesses causal or temporal ordering of events. Examples of event schemes are
the fixed prescriptions of start-up sequences discussed in chapter 1. A person-insituation scheme contains information of people and action typically found in
specific social situations, a compound knowledge of persons and events. The
distinction between these four types points at differences in attention and
meaning ascription, i.e. what a person tends to focus on as a basis for action.
Typical of all schemes is that they guide the perception of equivocal information.
They often shape memory towards consistency or orderliness. They also fill in
gaps where information is missing. Schemes are stored products of successful

<-----Page 40----->41

earlier sensemaking. They have a perseverance effect in that they tend to be
robust against change and thereby promote retrospectiveness (Lord & Foti, 1986,
p. 32). Schemes are built from experience, and they are believed to become more
abstract, contain more information and get more consistent over time.
When a person brings up a scheme in a particular situation it is in our
terms contingent on meaning ascribed to or imposed on the situation due to
attention, basic values and beliefs and schemes at hand. Meaning and schemes
are interrelated. Ascribed or imposed meanings are keys to bring relevant
schemes forward, but schemes may also specify the expectation of meaningful
occurrences. Schemes may create a self-fulfilling process, i.e. an expectation that
something will happen, makes it happen or provokes interpretation that it does
(Gioia, 1986, p. 63). Basic values and beliefs have governed what schemes have
become stored. At the same time development of more elaborated schemes may
affect beliefs through meaning reconstruction (cf. Ranson, Hinings &
Greenwood, 1980). Also action is reciprocally related to interpretive schemes with ascribed or imposed meaning in between. Daft & Weick (1984) identify
interpretation modes. In one of them organisations learn by doing. This is also to
say that they actively develop interpretive schemes for future action. Other
organisations interpret and act within traditional boundaries, which implies that
they rely on existing schemes.
Schemes taken for granted by people enable them to recognise, interpret
and negotiate even strange and unanticipated situations and thus continuously to
create and recreate meaning in the course of interaction (Ranson, Hinings &
Greenwood, 1980). But schemes also work as blinders. The more successfully
they are used, the more resistance they can evoke when they need to be changed
in view of e.g. a desired outcome. But meaning construction is not only a process
of recalling existing interpretive schemes. If that were true, no new learning
could occur (Gioia, 1986). Instead, meaning construction and understanding
involves association of experience with existing knowledge, alteration of
existing schemes by incorporating new knowledge, and occasionally a dramatic
restructuring or creation of knowledge by intuition and revelation (Bartunek,
1984). To handle that the literature (see e.g. Brytting, 1991, p. 76; Gioia, 1986)
sometimes uses the notion of "Piagetian framework", in which assimilation
denotes the incorporation of experience into existing schemes (integration) and
accommodation refers to construction or alteration of schemes in the face of
experience (creation).
Schemes are used either intentionally and therefore under the person's
control or automatically, not consciously. The role of schemes is to facilitate life
and lessen the "cognitive load" (Lord & Foti, 1986, p. 21) brought on people

<-----Page 41----->42

when simultaneously handling a large number of situations. Particularly the
automatically working schemes enhance our capacity to manage many tasks.
To conclude, interpretive schemes can be both beneficial and detrimental
for business start-up. On one hand an entrepreneur's well developed event
schemes and person-in-situations schemes based on previous work experience
can become appropriate guiding lines for action. On the other hand, if existing
schemes govern action in terms of assimilation when accommodation would be
called for, they may cause problems or failure.

3. 2. 6 Attention, Clue Seeking and Selection of
Information
The environment brings the individual information for sensemaking. For any
specific situation, where the individual perceives a need or a potential need to
act, the entire datum of information tends to be abundant. There is a problem
what information to attend to. The situation is equivocal (Gartner et al. 1992). So
the individual needs guidance regarding what information to distinguish for
further attention and use. Now an interplay starts between attention to information and creation of meaning. In the selection of information clues are needed.
Clues work as reference points in the large and complicated quantity of
information. But once extracted, clues may suggest something more (Weick,
1995, pp. 49-50). Clues map, discover and create at the same time. Clues
interplay with meaning. A meaning attributed at the start of the process can
change and develop as a result of the clues selected and applied to information
selection. Clues trigger meaning development. The individual can in an active
role through meaning development produce change in her/his environment due
to information selected. Attention, clue seeking and selection of information is to
a greater or lesser extent done by the individual in conjunction with others.
An important question is whether attention and clue-seeking consciously
and intentionally can be done by the individual, and whether it is possible by
clue selection to govern one's own development of meaning. The question is
problematic. According to Bateson (1979, p. 56) people are not conscious of the
processes we call perception, only the products of the processes. Furthermore, in
these non-conscious processes, people use assumptions and preconditions, which
will be part of the final perceived result. We know very little of the brain's way
of forming perception. Still, Bateson (1979, p. 268) contends that it is possible to
assume that perception can be governed by his referring to results from a number
of studies. For this study the assumption will be that attention is partly automatic

<-----Page 42----->43

(cf. Kiesler & Sproull, 1982, p. 555), some clues may be non-consciously
selected which will make information selection more automatic. But actors may
also put much effort into attention, selecting clues out of several perceived ones
and the actor may even express clear-cut reasons for the selection. Even if the
processes behind are not known, reasons stated for selection can express
meaning.
In the equivocal reality the individual engages him/herself or becomes
engaged in many problems at the same time. When attributed, meaning problems
may be connected or not. Information seeking, clue seeking and action evolve
differently and at different times. Meanings change as current projects change
(Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991, p. 435). One reason for change is influence on
meaning construction by actors around a focal actor and change of surrounding
actors.

3. 2. 7 Symbols in Sensemaking
Construction and reconstruction of meaning is done throughout any specific
sensemaking process. To ascribe or impose meaning to a situation is an attempt
to gain understanding. One of the ways people engage in the sensemaking
process is by using symbols to convey meaning and understanding. A symbol is
some representative sign that stands for some other object, entity or concept
(Gioia, 1986, p. 52). Symbols are part of meaning construction and relate to the
other components in the sensemaking process. Organising provides people and
organisations involved in the process with names, roles and identities
(Czarniawska-Joerges, 1994). These may take on symbolic meaning. In a
business start-up the identity issue is connected to the entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurship is often associated with a stock of taken-for-granted meanings,
regarding both the entrepreneur him/herself and surrounding actors as well as a
wider environment (society). The entrepreneur and entrepreneurship can be
typifications, ready-made labels that are attached to the words and to people
denoted by them (Schütz, 1967).

3. 2. 8 Implications of the Sensemaking View for
Start-up and Early Development

Business

The sensemaking process will be characterised by both individual and social
construction. At least some, albeit not all, meaning construction for events,

<-----Page 43----->44

objects, words and people will become shared between the actors (Smircich,
1983). The business start-up situation may for the entrepreneur include a
contradiction between the individual and social construction of reality. On one
hand the entrepreneur may bring in innovation to the market (Schumpeter, 1934)
which implies a different sensemaking from what is taken for granted. Individual
meaning construction may be prominent. On the other hand, the entrepreneur
may need sensemaking in conjunction with external actors (cf. section 1.2.4).
Fundamentally an actor's sensemaking concerns the individual in the
context but also groups such as a company or categories such as customer or
supplier. Interpretive schemes often contain prototypes, an abstract set of
features commonly associated with members of a category (cf. person schemes
above and Lord & Foti, 1986, p. 25). Sensemaking in the action processes may
be contingent on categories. Scott & Meyer (1991), use the notion of technical
and institutional environments. Following that, we define two corresponding
categories surrounding the entrepreneur.
The commercial context concerns production, distribution and exchange
in a market for goods and services. The entrepreneur - as well as other actors are rewarded for effective and efficient control of production, distribution and
exchange. This control makes sense for the actors and meaningful outcomes will
be characterised by trading: exchange of goods and services for money.
Participants in an exchange relationship impose meaning on: 1) reciprocity, by
which one is morally obligated to give something in return for something
received, 2) fair rates of exchange between utilitarian costs and benefits (Blau,
1964), and 3) distributive justice, through which all parties receive benefits that
are proportional to their investments (Homans, 1961).15
The institutional context is a category characterised by sensemaking rules
and requirements to which the entrepreneur must conform in order to receive
support and legitimacy. The entrepreneur and external actors construct and
reconstruct meaning with rules and requirements in mind. Typical external actors
surrounding a business start-up:
- regulatory agencies for e.g. registration of firms, fiscal authorities,
- professional and trade associations e.g. product testing and certification,
- morally and financially supporting agencies for business start-up.
The entrepreneurs' outcomes will imply action in conformance with rules,
regulations, conventions and generalised belief systems (Scott & Meyer, 1991).
Outcomes may also be based on order and advice provided by the external actors
15

We label this category commercial instead of Scott & Meyer's (1991) notion technical, in
order not to confuse it with the word technical in other senses.

<-----Page 44----->45

in the institutional context. This context differs from the commercial context in
constructed meanings. Often there is no reciprocity in these relations. They are
unilateral with one-sided directives or information (Stymne, 1970, p. 45) with
normative implications going from the external actor to the entrepreneur.
Relations are not characterised by exchange in the classical meaning of the word
(see above).
For many business start-ups a third context category would be
meaningful: the personal context. Family and friends are often important for the
start-up and the entrepreneur (Birley & Norburn, 1985; Johannisson, 1988)
Values and beliefs may have different implications from what may characterise
both the commercial and institutional contexts. Meanings based on family
relations and friendship will take on other content and requirements: more love,
liking and multiple common interests.
Sensemaking may imply no clear boundaries between the three types of
context. Business relations can take on meaning partly based on friendship (see
e.g. Johanson & Mattsson, 1987). Dependency of the entrepreneur on a dominant
supplier in the market can make sense for compliance with imposed conventions
(cf. Porter, 1980). Commercial exchange can make sense also in the personal
context, in for example family businesses.
As can be understood from the discussion above in this chapter there is no
fixed pattern or sequence of how attention, basic values and beliefs, interpretive
schemes interrelate with meaning. The entrepreneur in business start-up and
early development must manage situations, action processes and relationships
characterised by a variety of requirements. Different action processes within
commercial, institutional and personal contexts will be going on at the same time
with very different meanings (cf. Gartner, 1985). All these processes must be
handled by the entrepreneur him-/herself. This adds to the situation containing
equivocality, liability of newness and need for trustworthiness. Adaptiveness,
tolerance for ambiguity and different social skills must form part of the
entrepreneur's repertoire:
The owner-manager needs to have the broad thinking of a generalist and be able to
tolerate disorder, endure switching from role to role, and stick to fundamentals (Welsh &
White, 1981, p. 32).

Mitchell (1973) suggested three elements in content of interaction: a)
communication content; the passing of information from one to other, b)
exchange content; or the goods and services flowing between organisations, and
c) normative content; or the expectations one has of the other because of some

<-----Page 45----->46

social characteristics or attribute.16 Interaction between any two actors may
contain all the three elements, but one element may be prominent depending on
context category. The commercial context would then be characterised largely by
exchange content, the institutional context by normative content.
Communication content would be important in all three contexts and prominent
in the personal context. The personal context may also have an interaction based
on normative content. The entrepreneur must have social skills convening with
all three elements and must have ability to identify and create meanings
involved.
Sensemaking in Weick's view depicts actors as active. Many choices are
made out of a multifacetted reality. This leads to varied experience and
consequently a diversity of interpretive schemes. Resulting action, enactment,
will become highly personalised. Weick's view implies that there can be a wide
scope of e.g. strategic choice open to an actor, such as the entrepreneur (Child,
1972). Actually, even the environment becomes personalised into a context in
the way the sensemaking works. Enactment implies: Which other actors will be
attended to depends on the actor! And, as Czarniawska-Joerges (1994) contends,
some actors will be more successful than others in making sense of a context that
matches their visions. Those more actively making sense of the context will in
enactment by trial and error build more externally oriented interpretive schemes
(Daft & Weick, 1984, p. 294), and they build their schemes more in conjunction
with external actors. This may provide a wider scope of possible action for an
entrepreneur.
On the other hand the liability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965) implies
the need for building relations with external actors. It can be described in terms
of reciprocal sensemaking processes. If the entrepreneur is not familiar with
other potential actors there may be no relevant schemes of earlier success or
failure ready to guide relations towards the actors. The process is one of reality
construction implying trial and error, which can be both hazardous and timeconsuming. Enactment is also learning. Ties (schemes) standing for accurate
knowledge of customer needs and quality requirements, channelling of orders
etc. are lacking and loyalty between the parties does not exist yet. Seen from
other actors' points of view, the situation is similar. There may not be relevant
schemes of earlier success or failure guiding relations towards the specific actor
either. Nor may schemes come forward in their minds guiding them how
procedures for information, merchandise handling etc. will work towards the
16

Stymne (1970, p. 45) used a similar classification: 1) reciprocal (exchange in market), 2)
unilateral (one-sided imformation), and 3) unilateral (one-sided directives, such as legislation).

<-----Page 46----->47

start-up. To the extent the start-up and other actors are familiar with one another
from before, present schemes may become further resorted to by assimilation or
developed by accommodation. One interesting point about one entirely new
party is the possibility that reciprocal trust-building will facilitate common action
by congruent schemes emerging.
Unfolding action means that interacts will influence later action by
accommodation and assimilation of interpretive schemes. Sensemaking can by
meaning development and changing schemes have deviating and amplifying
effects on action processes and vice versa. Action processes and events within
them can by sensemaking be connected in a way to change outcomes. This is the
essence of enactment. Often loops will emerge like virtuous or vicious circles
(Weick, 1979, pp. 72-83) An entrepreneur, having a good reputation from earlier
employment, could by doing something good in action processes in others' view
amplify this reputation. External actors bracket positive information, earlier
information will be confirmed and strengthened, i.e. his action in the process
affects their sensemaking. Another entrepreneur, running into temporary
difficulties, could have a tough time convincing actors having information of
earlier difficulties that problems are over, i.e. their views and action ought to be
revised - but his action does not change their meaning and accommodation of
schemes will not occur, rather may the old schemes become reinforced. Selfreinforcing schemes could develop what Merton (1968) called self-fulfilling
prophecies after having studied a bank crisis during the great depression. He
found that the rumour of the bank being insolvent caused the clients to withdraw
their savings which then actually provoked insolvency. Likewise, from
surrounding potential actors prospective entrepreneurs often meet attitudes
which may assume the character of a self-fulfilling prophecy: Macmillan (1983)
points at external actors committing themselves to a new venture and thereby
becoming gateopeners for others to commit themselves - and vice versa (cf.
section 1.1). The actors' prophecies may contribute to the actual unfolding of
events.
In a two party relation both parties construct and reconstruct meaning
concerning the other. Reciprocal influences between enacted contexts occur.
Their schemes can by mutual influence become developed in similar or different
directions. In group relations the same phenomenon can also be seen. Janis
(1972) thus in Victims of Groupthink described how groups slightly isolated
from their environment developed shared illusions of invulnerability and
morality, stereotyped views of external parties and a shared illusion of group
unanimity. That can be interpreted as reciprocal influences between their
individually enacted contexts resulting in joint construction of meanings with

<-----Page 47----->48

little influence from other sources. Entrepreneurs who foster an open context, by
enacting new actors for new outcomes, run less risk of becoming victims of
groupthink than when context and outcomes are seen to be fixed.

3. 3 Conclusion: Sensemaking in Action
Process
The arguments in this chapter are that in an equivocal reality actors act in action
processes to promote desired outcomes in the new venture creation. They need
different meaningful clues as to what action makes sense to embark upon.
Individually and together with other actors in an enacted context they construct
meaning concerning action: sensemaking. Sensemaking and action processes are
intertwined in enactment. This implies that meaning guides the unfolding of
action processes and in an action process meaning becomes developed. Meaning
is sought in interrelation between the individual's basic values and beliefs,
experience memorised as interpretive schemes concerning earlier action
performed, and her/his attention to a situation. Symbols can convey meaning.
We discuss some different situations where sensemaking is important to
understand action concerning new ventures. We have in this chapter not been
very specific about what meaning can be. We assume, however, that there is a
vast variety of representations in the human mind that potentially constitute
meaning for action processes and a basis for enactment. This study will from
now on concentrate on trust as one such meaning. The next chapter is devoted to
studying trust as the literature deals with it, and introduces a notion of trust into
our frame of reference for the study.

Chapter 4

Trust
4. 1 The Notion of Trust
In the Merriam-Webster Dictionary (1976) trust is defined as "assured reliance
on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone and something". It has
also a definition of trust in a commercial setting: "reliance on future payment for
property (as merchandise) delivered" (p. 952). Central in both the general and the
more commercially oriented definitions is that someone, a truster, believes
something about someone or something else, a trustee. The truster has a belief
about the trustee's ability to do something, about her/his character etc. This belief
is somehow important for the truster who may be at odds if the trustee does not
live up to what the truster expects him/her to do or be.
Trust as a more or less prominent issue has been studied by i.a.
psychologists, sociologists, economists, management and marketing theorists and in philosophy (Hosmer, 1995). A multifacetted phenomenon lacking
agreement on fundamental definitions and ways to define it lends itself to be
grasped and summarised by different views on it. Two main views concerning
trust can be traced in this literature. In the first expectation is seen as the essence
of trust. The second view also concerns expectation, but it is qualified against
risk. These two main views of trust and the more specific aspects that can be
seen in the literature, namely trustworthiness, reputation and distrust, need to be
discussed here before stating the study's view of trust.

4. 1. 1 Trust and Expectation
In the view of trust as expectation Luhmann (1979) is a common point of
reference for most authors published in the field since 15 years. In any relation
we put trust on another party, that s/he will meet with our expectations. Our
action is often based on expectations that others will do things which will favour
us or at least not put us in a detrimental position. Trust builds on one's
expectation that the other will act in some desired way. Expectation implies that

<-----Page 49----->50

this will not occur immediately but in a future time. Trust comes in as a form of
complexity reduction (Luhmann, 1979) involving a problematic relationship
with time. "To show trust is to anticipate the future. It is to behave as though the
future were certain." (p. 10) That is to say: Man makes use of the present trying
to reduce complexity of the future. Trust in the present forms the basis for trust
in the future.
Barber (1983) has the same outlook as Luhmann (1979) in taking an
actor's expectations as a starting point for trust. Expectation is for him meanings
actors attribute to themselves and others as they make choices about which
actions and reactions lead to desired ends and are emotionally and morally
appropriate. Barber (1983, p. 7) sees three kinds of expectations underlying trust:
1) Expectation of the persistence and fulfillment of the natural
and
the moral order.
2) Expectation of technically competent role performance from
parties
involved with us in social relationships and systems.
3) Expectation that partners in interaction will carry out their
fiduciary obligations and responsibilities, that is, their duties in
certain situations to place other's interest before their own.
Society is based on natural and moral order. Trust works as a "functional and
cultural variable" (Barber, 1983, p. 5) and in the two more specific ways above.
Man puts trust in competence. In a complex society with accumulation of
knowledge and technical expertise, professionals and professional groups are
often looked upon as trustworthy (Barber, 1983, p. 14). For example, a
technically competent engineer presenting a technical solution to a problem will
normally be trusted. Trust as fiduciary obligations and responsibilities, goes
beyond technically competent performance to the moral dimensions of
interaction. Technically competent performance can be monitored insofar as it is
based on shared knowledge and expertise. But when some parties to a social
relationship or some members of a social system cannot comprehend the
expertise, performance can anyway be controlled by trust.
Expectations need to be tied to someone or something. Zucker (1986, p.
53) discusses how people connect expectations and sees three central modes of
trust. In process-based trust the decision or inclination to trust is contingent on a
record of prior exchange often obtained second-hand or by imputation from
outcomes of prior exchange. The prevailing view is that persons and firms make
investments in process-based trust by creating positive "reputations" or brandnames (Zucker, 1986, p. 61). In characteristics-based trust all that is necessary is
information concerning social similarity (Zucker, 1986, p. 61). Similarity in
family background or social situation may be sought out as a basis for common

<-----Page 50----->51

understanding and for attaining reciprocally satisfactory exchange outcomes.
Institutional-based trust is tied to formal societal structures, depending on
individual or firm-specific attributes. Formal mechanisms are used to provide
trust that does not rest on personal characteristics or on past history of exchange.
Formal mechanisms can be membership in a sub-culture, such as a well-known
professional association, or intermediary mechanisms, such as commonly
accepted procedures.
But how much reason and experience are expectations based on? Lewis &
Weigert (1985) discuss expectation as a leap beyond what reason and experience
alone would warrant. Expectation is according to them not necessarily
calculative. Expectation can differ as to what one expects from the other.
Expectation can mean hope. Luhmann (1979, p. 24) uses the word hope to
denote expectation without connection to a decision. Trust implies that you
handle an uncertain situation in a calculative manner. One who hopes simply has
confidence despite uncertainty. Trust reflects contingency. Hope ignores contingency. The one who trusts bears the risk of miscalculation and trust
unfulfilled. Anyone who puts hope into someone or something ignores risk and
more or less takes things for granted. Giddens (1990) opposes the view of
calculation as a basis for trust. It is unhelpful to connect the notion of trust to the
specific circumstances in which individuals consciously contemplate alternative
courses of action. Trust is usually much more of a continuous state (Giddens,
1990, p. 32) and, when trust is given to people, it is connected to non-calculative
attribution of emotions, like honour, love and faith - sometimes also to
correctness of abstract principles like expertise. Also for other authors
expectation can contain predictability (e.g. Zucker, 1986) or only confidence in
other's good-will (Ring & van de Ven, 1992).
The effects expectations may have were demonstrated by Zand (1972), in
investigating the role of managers' trust in solving a marketing-manufacturing
policy problem. He studied two groups, one characterised by low trust in the
group's problem-solving behaviour, the other high trust. In the low trust group
the energy and creativity was diverted from finding comprehensive, realistic
solutions, and members used the problem as an instrument to minimise their
vulnerability. In contrast, in the high trust group there was less socially generated
uncertainty and problems were solved more effectively.

4. 1. 2 Trust and Risk

<-----Page 51----->52

The debate indicated in the last section brings us over the view of trust as
expectation qualified by risk. The essence of going into a risky situation can be
seen like this: The penalty (disutility) one suffers if the other abuses one's
expectation is greater than the benefit (utility) one gains if the other does not
abuse that expectation. The main source of reference for his view is Deutsch
(1962). If you trust someone you give that person something that is or can be
important to yourself. The trusted person acts on that but outside of your control.
Risk is attributable therefore to the action of others, including the possibility that
they will behave opportunistically, such as withhold information, create
confusion etc. (Lorentz, 1988). Some risks are avoidable. You can choose not to
trust a person, company etc. But then you may miss something valuable, e.g. a
business opportunity. Luhmann (1979, p. 33) argues that the truster seeks clues
whether or not trust is justified. By the clues you can reduce risk but not
eliminate it.
If you trust someone to do something for your benefit, you expose
yourself to risk of suffering detrimental effects. You become vulnerable.
Vulnerability is central in some definitions of trust. According to Sabel (1993, p.
1133) trust is the mutual confidence that no party to an exchange will exploit
another's vulnerability. Parties to an exchange can be vulnerable in several
different ways. Barney & Hansen (1994, p. 176) in discussing adverse selection
vulnerability and hold-up vulnerability thus argues as follows: When a party
brings to an exchange resources that are costly to evaluate, the party is subject to
adverse selection vulnerability, because the other party may find it cheaper,
easier to evaluate or less risky to choose resources from a third party. When
parties bring to an exchange asymmetric transaction-specific investments they
are subject to hold-up vulnerability. A hold-up situation is at hand when one of
the parties has invested large amounts of money in e.g. product development and
needs cash from sales, which the other party knows and can make use of in
negotiations. Trust in these situations appears to be when the parties share a
mutual confidence that the other party will not exploit adverse selection or holdup vulnerability. For start-up firms the problem of both kinds can be important.
Being new can lead to adverse selection vulnerability, being small in the market
can lead to hold-up situations.

4. 1. 3 Trust and Trustworthiness
In the discussion above there are expressions concerning the truster's beliefs
about the trustee; beliefs as a basis for trust. Trust is belief seen from the truster's

<-----Page 52----->53

point of view. Trust seen from the trustee's point of view is trustworthiness, i.e.
to be worthy of trust in the eyes of truster. Trustworthy is in the Oxford
Dictionary of current English defined as: worthy of trust, dependable, and in
Merriam-Webster Thesaurus (1991, p. 627) as reliable, having qualities that
merit confidence or trust. Reliable is a synonym to trustworthy. A related notion
is credible. If it is believed that a person's word is reliable and corresponds with
her/his deeds, that person will be considered trustworthy (Huemer, 1994).
Credible often denotes trustworthy in a slightly narrower sense, denoting what a
person says. Trustworthiness is an attribute of individual parties, while trust is an
attribute of a relationship between parties. Trustworthiness is given to a person
(trustee) by another (truster); it is a conferred status. Expectations and norms
form trustworthiness, but also experience from the relation between trustee and
truster. Trustworthiness can also be attributed to a group of persons, (trustees) if
this group is expected by the truster to be uniform in relation to the truster.
Every social action involves the actor's presenting himself in terms of
trustworthiness (Luhmann, 1979, p. 39). The actor knows that and gauges her/his
action accordingly. The result is selective representation of him/herself, which
provides other criteria on which to build up trustworthiness and to establish
norms of anticipated continuity. Trustworthiness will be formed gradually, in
selective steps, by a combination of action choices and action already determined
institutionally or historically (cf. interpretive schemes). We choose whom we
will consider trustworthy, in which respects and under what circumstances. We
base the choice on what we take to be "good reasons", constituting evidences of
trustworthiness. Trustworthiness involves at least some familiarity with the
object of trust (Lewis & Weigert, 1985). We wish to know the sort of person we
are dealing with before we deal with him/her. But we will know it only imperfectly. We form an opinion on the basis of background, the opportunities s/he
has faced, the courses of action s/he has taken and so forth. Our opinion is thus
based partly on the theory we hold of the effect of culture, class membership,
family line, and the like, partly on a person's motivation (her/his disposition) and
hence behaviour (cf. basic values and beliefs). Our problem in essence is to infer
the person's qualities from such data (Dasgupta, 1988).
In Koenig's (1995) view the trusting party develops expectations
regarding its opposite's behaviour, in mutually relevant matters. If the party is
trustworthy, it will feel obliged to fulfill these expectations. Only if specific
expectations can be formed on one hand, and fulfilled on the other, is
trustworthiness confirmed and reconfirmed. A breach of trust occurs when there
is awareness of the expectations, but no fulfillment. Consequently, in the
development of a relationship there is a reciprocality in the roles of truster and

<-----Page 53----->54

trustee. For mutual trust to develop, both parties need to display trustworthiness
before the other (cf. Blau, 1964). The process may start, though, by one requiring
more trustworthiness than the other. Aware of the anticipations regarding its
general conduct, the trusted party becomes trustworthy. The party then feels the
obligation to fulfill these anticipations. The combination of anticipation and
obligation yields an effective mode of co-ordination (Koenig, 1995).
Trustworthiness is dependent on norms and social structures. Barney &
Hansen (1994) consider that trustworthiness is partly based on the existence of
elaborate social and economic governance mechanisms and that opportunistic
behaviour would violate values, principles and standards of behaviour that have
been internalised by parties to an exchange. In some situations trustworthiness is
clearly exogenous to a particular exchange structure, in other it is endogenous.
Values, principles and standards may reflect an exchange partner's unique
history, culture or the personal beliefs and values of individuals associated with
it.

4. 1. 4 Reputation
What is extensively said or believed about a person's or an object's character is
covered by the notion of reputation (Bromley, 1993, p. 1). Reputation can
concern what the person has done, is or has been able to do or her/his
outstanding attributes. Not only a person, but also groups or organisations can
get reputation. Weigelt & Camerer (1988) for example define corporate
reputation as a set of attributes ascribed to a firm, inferred from the firm's past
actions. A product is an example of an object which can be given a reputation.
Trust, as we have discussed it, is between two parties: truster and trustee.
Reputation includes a third party, a more or less easily defined set of people or
objects. The word "extensively" above indicates that this third party is often
large and unspecified, e.g. customers in general, people in the industry, industrial
purchasers in Europe. Reputation is also a shift of our interest in trust over to the
third party. Mainly, when we use the word reputation, we imply that the third
party has an impact on trust. The trusters' beliefs about the trustee is mediated
through the third party. Trust, where reputation has an impact, becomes
complicated. The third party could consist of people with different pre-existing
beliefs (interpretive schemes) about the trustee or object. It is often difficult to
establish whether a specific alleged reputation is widespread or not, if it is
unanimous or not. The grounds, i.e. what it is based on, or the motives for a
reputation can be significant, but difficult to find out.

<-----Page 54----->55

About the importance of reputation in economic life Hayek (1948) meant
that in actual life we have inadequate knowledge of the available commodities or
services. This is made up for by our experience with the persons or firms
supplying them - competition is in a large measure competition for reputation or
goodwill. His conclusion was that reputation is one of the most important factors
which enables us to solve our daily problems. There is a discussion in the literature of just how important reputation is and how it works: Just as with trust
between truster and trustee, reputation can be built up by pursuing certain
courses of action, or destroyed by pursuing certain others. Normally it is
acquired gradually. People invest resources for the purpose of building a
reputation of being trustworthy (Dasgupta, 1988). Reputation can also concern
the exchange parties themselves.
Trust is more likely to be extended to an organization when that organization earns a
reputation in the market place for following norms of equity (Ring & van de Ven, 1992,
p. 489).

Madhok (1995) in an investigation of opportunism and trust in joint venture
relationships found that reputation was important when the parties lacked
familiarity with one another. But Ring & van de Ven (1992, p. 489) also state:
a reputation for trustworthiness, while necessary for acting in reliance on trust in a
business relationship, is not sufficient.

There is a line of discussion concerning reputation as important but not
always necessary or sufficient. What kinds of limits are there? According to
Huemer (1994, p. 3): "Reputation is only part of trust: a look into a rear-view
window." This means that reputation may be lost, and not to be relied upon due
to changes that the third party has not observed. In the words of Lorentz (1988,
p. 206) who studied subcontractor's trustworthiness: "Reputation (given by
others) is not enough, own experience is also necessary." Reputation from a third
party can not replace the truster - trustee relationship. Differences between how
the truster and the third party make sense of the trustee may exist.

4. 1. 5 Trust and Distrust
Trust implies positive expectations, i.e. a trustee expects the truster to bring
him/her something positive. Distrust implies the opposite: A trustee expects the
truster to bring him/her something detrimental. Would then no expectation of

<-----Page 55----->56

trust and no expectation of distrust be the same? Distrust can be seen not to be
the opposite of trust (Luhmann, 1979, p. 71). Differences between trust and
distrust are in Luhmann's view due to the functions of trust. Trust reduces social
complexity and simplifies social life. Distrust, on the other hand, is often
emotionally tense and often frantic. It displays repertoires of fixed roles, such as
seeing each other as enemies to be fought. Distrust relieves the role partners from
obligations to one another. Moral order may even seem to be non-existent or not
meaningful. Social interaction combined with expectations within trust may over
time and by increasing contact have strengthened ties as a motive. Distrust, on
the other hand, often implies rudimentary or no contacts at all and often a wish to
preserve distrust (Luhmann, 1979, p. 74).
In the present study it is in this vein assumed that a change from distrust
to trust (and vice versa) will necessitate radical shifts in the parties' construction
of meaning, especially if earlier expectation is strongly developed. The study
will not focus distrust, nor shifts between trust and distrust.

4. 2 Trust and Action Processes
In chapter 3 the view was presented that meaning interplays with action,
enactment. Does trust as meaning also imply that there is an interplay between
trust and action processes, i.e. that trust influences an individual's enactment?
Does trust develop in and through action processes? Arrow wrote that "virtually
every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust, certainly any
transaction conducted over a period of time" (1973, p. 24) and that "trust is an
important lubricant in the social system" (1974, p. 23). This depicts a view of
trust as important for the unfolding of action processes. Blau (1964, p. 98) argues
that social exchange generates trust: "As individuals regularly discharge their
obligations, they prove themselves trustworthy of further credits." Specifically,
he points at the connection between action and development of trust.17
Development of trust in action is also a theme of Luhmann (1979, p. 42):
In open-ended situations and where both parties can operate selective choices, which
influence one another, it is possible to set in motion a process which forms trust by
17

However, in his view there is a distinction between purely social exchange and economic
exchange in that the former "engender feelings of personal obligation, gratitude and trust,
purely economic exchange as such does not." His view on this marked distinction between
social and economic exchange has been extensively critizised, by e.g. Emerson, (1975) based
on a view that economic exchange also contains more or less clear elements of personal
obligation, gratitude and trust.

<-----Page 56----->57
tackling problems of the reduction of complexity over several discrete steps, i.e.
sequentially.

So for Luhmann development of trust will occur by successive and deliberate
selection of action forming the action process with trust-building in mind.
This brings the discussion over to action processes and time. Perrow
(1986, p. 240) uses the term trust when there are long-term relationships between
firms and suppliers, firms and customers or supervisors and workers. He stresses
continuity in trustful relations: "repeated interactions", and "bilateral
relationship". An action process with trust-building in mind and extended over
time will require something more. There are demands concerning commitment in
the process. Luhmann argues again (1979, p. 64) that:
Trust accumulates as a kind of capital, which opens up more opportunities for more
extensive action but which must be continually used and tended and which commits the
user to a trustworthy self-presentation.

Shared expectation between the actors is essential for action to occur
(Zucker, 1986). Shared expectations may develop piecemeal, though. The
trusting party displays expectation regarding the opposite's behaviour in
mutually relevant matters. If the party is trustworthy, the opposite party will feel
obliged to fulfill these expectations. The process may take a long time. A drive
to create standardised expectations can emerge, if all parties are motivated (cf.
Håkansson, 1982). But as has been discussed in chapter 3, shared expectations in
common action do not necessarily mean common goals. In the long run the
development of a relationship will promote a reciprocality in the roles of truster
and trustee. For mutual trust to develop, both parties need to display
trustworthiness before the other (cf. Blau, 1964). Combination of anticipation
and obligation yields an effective mode of co-ordination (Koenig, 1995).
Gradually growth of mutual trust occurs.
By discharging their obligations for service rendered, individuals demonstrate their
trustworthiness, and the gradual expansion of mutual service is accompanied by a parallel
growth of mutual trust. Hence processes of social exchange, which may originate in pure
self-interest generate trust in social relations through their recurrent and gradually
expanding character (Koenig,1995, p. 94 ).

But the opposite may also occur. Unfulfilled expectations and betrayal can break
trust-building as well as common action.
To sum up, there is evidence from the literature of an interplay between
trust and action/action processes. There are also views implying that trust

<-----Page 57----->58

develops in and through action processes. In our study's terminology trust makes
sense and may therefore influence enactment.

4. 3 Sensemaking Trust
Sensemaking is future-oriented. It concerns outcomes and action to come. Trust
as expectation is also oriented towards the future (Luhmann, 1979, p. 10):
To show trust is to anticipate the future. It is to behave as if the future were certain.

A truster gives attention to information in which expectation concerning
the trustee is worked upon, clues are bracketed and elaborated in a construction
of meaning. Basic values and beliefs concerning trust as well as trust from earlier
occasions residing in interpretive schemes will also be brought into the meaning
construction. Expectations concerning a trustee will be an element in action
formed and entered upon, enactment. Experience concerning trust in the action
performed will be worked upon and perhaps reconstructed for assimilation in or
accommodation to existing schemes. Trust can be an important element in the
sensemaking process. The next step is to further consider how trust can work in
the sensemaking process.

4. 3. 1 Trust and Basic Values / Beliefs
Trust as existential ideas is a part of people's general values about obligations
and moral order (see above). People may experience trust in obligation to be
important in social life, where obligation denotes promise, duty or condition that
indicates what action ought to be taken. Behind obligation there is a sense of
what is right towards others. If this sense of what is right is generally accepted,
as the law, obligations extend to become general moral order (Barber, 1983, p.
16). Barber (1983) and Zucker (1986) discuss expectation as tied to obligation
and moral order. Expectation is based on assumptions of others' values
concerning obligation and moral order. Our own values, conscious or more
taken-for-granted, will underlie construction of meaning. We need unanimity
with or at least predictability of other's values for entering into trust with them.
Basic values and beliefs with trust as an element pertain also to business
and work life In business marketing, trust has been viewed as a belief about an
exchange partner's trustworthiness that comes out of the partner's expertise,

<-----Page 58----->59

reliability or intentionality. Behavioural intention or behaviour reflecting reliance
of a partner is another issue, which may also involve vulnerability and
uncertainty on behalf of the truster. Also honesty, standing by one's word,
fulfilling role obligations, interest in the other party's welfare, sincerity and
timeliness are discussed (Moorman, Deshpandé & Zaltman, 1993). These values
and beliefs are preconditions for business relations or transaction to occur. In the
view of this study values relate to expected business outcomes by meanings.
A third area of basic values and beliefs is human relations. Trust may be
based on the degree to which one party judges that another party will fulfill its
commitments and that the relationship is equitable. Norms of equity can be
important for trust (Ring & van de Ven, 1992) The concept of equity is
developed in exchange theory, which argues that participants in a relationship
desire reciprocity, by which one is morally obligated to give something in return
for something received, fair rates of exchange between utilitarian costs and
benefits, and distributive justice, through which all parties receive benefits that
are proportional to their investments (cf. Zucker, 1986, p. 60; also Blau, 1964;
Homans, 1961).
Schurr & Ozanne (1985) found that buyers' expectations about trust
significantly affected attitudes and behaviour toward their current supplier. Low
trust stimulated less favourable attitudes, communications and bargaining power
with respect to the supplier. Reciprocity, fairness in exchange and distributive
justice are values which have impact on meaning.

4. 3. 2 Trust and Interpretive Schemes
According to Luhmann, (1979 p. 26) trust makes sense in situations to generalise
experiences and extend them to other similar cases. Retrospectiveness is
prevalent in his notion of trust. His views parallel that of Weick (1979, 1995).
Trust takes on the properties of interpretive schemes as we have met it in the last
chapter about sensemaking. In the view of Zucker (1986) trust has background
expectations as one major component, which stands for interpretive frames,
indices and signals, used for interpretation of meaning. These frames operate the
way we have seen discussed among the sensemaking writers: to see events and
action in a typical way, to make use of pre-established knowledge. Persons and
firms make investments in creating schemes about e.g. brands, family
background, professional association where trust is tied to exchange, persons and
formal social structures respectively. Membership in a sub-culture, e.g.
association for chartered accountants, brings automatically trust to individual

<-----Page 59----->60

members. Mechanisms that e.g. guarantee the performance of something can
imply competence. Concerning business start-up, this view of Zucker (1986) can
be exemplified as follows: When a bank makes as a condition for support to a
business start-up that the business idea should be scrutinised by a business startup consultant, we have a trust-building process based on competence in a social
structure. And a similar view is displayed by Barber (1983, p. 19):
Trust has the general function of social ordering, of providing cognitive and moral
expectational maps for actors and systems as they continuously interact.

Barber (1983) specifically discusses generalised beliefs about professions
and how trust pertains to these through schematic knowledge and assumptions.18
Trust as fiduciary obligations and responsibilities goes beyond technically
competent performance to the moral dimensions of interaction. Technically
competent performance can be monitored insofar as it is based on shared
knowledge and expertise. But when some parties to a social relationship or some
members of a social system cannot comprehend the expertise, performance can
anyway be controlled by trust. For example when someone marketed a
technically complicated solution to a problem, even if the solution is not
understood, trust could still emerge due to formal guarantees in e.g. contracts or
other forms of social control.
Barney & Hansen (1994) consider that trustworthiness is partly based on
the existence of elaborate social and economic governance mechanisms. They
further contend that opportunistic behaviour would violate values, principles and
standards of behaviour that have been internalised by parties to an exchange. In
some situations trustworthiness is clearly exogenous to a particular exchange
structure, in others they are endogenous. As discussed above, values, principles
and standards may reflect an exchange partner's unique history, culture or the
personal beliefs and values of critical individuals associated with it. Their notion
of governance mechanisms seem to be equivalent to the interplay between
meaning and interpretive schemes in the terms of this study's sensemaking frame
of reference and their discussion also brings in the impacts of basic values and
beliefs. We can also in their discussion see that interpretive schemes can be both
pertinent to a specific set of actors as well as in a larger setting. Zucker (1986, p.
64) goes more specifically into what she calls intermediary mechanisms: In
transactions between parties or in procedures between them, signals are given to
convey trust in the form of insurances, guarantees etc. These intermediary

18

Cf. also prototype: Lord & Foti (1986, p. 23).

<-----Page 60----->61

mechanisms signal the willingness of one party to protect the other from losses
or from failures of the signalling party.
When stored interpretive schemes do not make sense, the situation may be
attended to as being different. Personal trust can also be acquired by withdrawal
of standardised expectations from one's partner and replacing them with other
expectations, based on the partner's individual personality, unique style etc.
(assimilation and accommodation of schemes). For example: a customer meeting
an entrepreneur in a business start-up may have earlier standardised expectations
of new businesses and entrepreneurs, which may or may not be relevant in the
situation at hand. But, on the other hand trust residing in interpretive schemes
can be compared to a capital asset (Dasgupta, 1988), denoting the characteristics
that trust may need time and effort to acquire and is seen as valuable when it is
there. Once established, trust may resist accommodation and become a taken-forgranted belief.

4. 3. 3 Trust and Attention
Luhmann (1979, ch. 4) means that man lives in a complex world and he sees
trust as a reduction of complexity. The view parallels that of Weick (1979) and
Gioia (1986). So trust as a meaning gives a guide to attention. For attention,
clues implying trust are sought out. Luhmann (1979, p. 33):
A truster seeks in his subjective image some objective clues about whether or not trust is
justified.

Information congruent with trust is worked upon to become a basis for action. If
trust has been an issue earlier in a specific situation resembling a later situation,
people will look for and use information congruent with the earlier situation.
People also present themselves in a way so as to be assessed as trustworthy or in
the words of Luhmann (1979, p. 41): "every socially comprehensible action also
involves the actor's presenting himself in terms of his trustworthiness". We
explicitly or implicitly judge trustworthiness (Gambetta, 1988, p. 217):
The probability that the other will perform an action that is beneficial or at least not
detrimental to us to consider engaging in some form of co-operation with him.

In a situation which is relatively open-ended, and where both parties can
operate selective choices which influence one another, trust can be formed in
several separate steps (Luhmann, 1979, p. 42). Attention and meaning

<-----Page 61----->62

construction and reconstruction interplay. Trust can be built gradually as or
within meaning development.
Also standardised expectations of trust (see above) can in this way be
replaced by trust in the trustee. Reputation as standardised expectation, mediated
by a third party, is a way to get attention. This makes judgement against meaning
different. Since
- the third party may not be involved in direct communication
- the grounds and motives for reputation are difficult to assess
- reputation may differ between groups
- reputation may be static, i.e. does not take into account changing conditions
meaning will become more complex between the parties. But if reputation by
truster is considered relevant and clear-cut, selection may be facilitated (cf.
Hayek, 1948, and Barney & Hansen, 1994).

4. 4 Conclusions: The Frame of Reference for the
Study
The theory-based discussion above gives four conclusions concerning trust for
the study's frame of reference. 1) trust is mainly expectations 2) trust can be onesided or mutual 3) clues to trust as meaning can be identified 4) trust as meaning
is affected by basic values, interpretive schemes, attention and action.
The first conclusion is that expectations are prominent in most authors'
view of trust. The sociologists Luhmann (1979), Barber (1983), Zucker (1986) as
well as the economists and business administration writers Arrow (1974),
Håkansson et al. (1982), Lewis & Weigert (1985), Ring & Van de Ven (1992,
1994) make expectation essential among trusting parties. Also among exchange
theorists (Homans, 1961; Blau, 1964) reciprocity, fair exchange and distributive
justice are notions containing element of expectations. Therefore expectations
will in this study be a foundation to the notion of trust.
A second conclusion concerning trust is distinguishable in the references
above: Who trusts whom in an action process? That is to say, for a focal trustee,
different trusters can vary in beliefs concerning the trustee. Hence
trustworthiness as a notion will be important as a set of one-sided expectations
concerning one actor in the eyes of another actor. It is a conferred status.
Trustworthiness is then a set of expectations concerning one actor in the eyes of
another actor. Mutuality in beliefs regarding oneself and one or several
counterparts is a common theme in the literature. Mutuality, i.e. shared expecta-

<-----Page 62----->63

tion, is a mutually conferred status. Mutual trust is a set of expectations shared
by actors involved in an interaction.
The third conclusion runs as follows. Trust is part of the basic values and
beliefs of any actor concerning e.g. the role of business, human relations and
work (cf. section 3.2.4). By sensemaking the actors construct meaning to create
unequivocality out of equivocal situations (cf. section 3.3). By clues invented
and extracted out of meaning, complexity in information will be reduced and
possibility for action increased (cf. section 3.2.6). The question is now: What
clues can trusters invent and extract out of the meaning of trust? That is to say:
On what will the truster base trust? To what is trust associated? The views of
Barber (1983), Luhmann (1979) and Zucker (1986) applied to the study issues
indicate three bases for an actor to make sense of trust (section 4.1.1):
- a person, e.g. the entrepreneur
- an organisation, i.e. the new venture in early development
- some kind of normal order of things in the eyes of the truster, such as "how we
normally do in business" or "in this industry".
This leads to a view of actors' (trusters') sensemaking of trust as
1) Person-based, where trust is tied to person, her/his characteristics,
competence and experience, managerial and commercial capacity
2) Enterprise-based, where trust is tied to the enterprise as an entity, its
operations of past and future action processes, its products, resources and
financial stability
3) Institution-based, where trust is tied to formal mechanisms based on law and
norms in society or a sub-society, general values, beliefs, moral order, and
traditions.

Chapter 5

Methodology
5. 1 Basic Assumptions
The researcher's choice of methods is ultimately governed by assumptions about
the nature of the reality under investigation (ontology), about a deterministic or
voluntaristic view of human nature, about the nature of knowledge produced
(epistemology) and methodology (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Assumptions within
this range always pervade how the researcher approaches the study field and how
the researcher interacts with phenomena in the study area. The reader may very
well have noticed that basic assumptions concerning the study have to a large
extent already been stated by choices made in the chapters so far.
The notion of sensemaking implies that reality is seen through the minds
of people. Reality is further shaped and changed in their minds as people act on
the basis of their view of reality. The entrepreneurs create the new venture in
interaction with external actors. The resulting new venture will make sense for
the entrepreneur, shaped by not only the entrepreneur but also by others. A
choice was made to see trustworthiness as a set of expectations concerning one
actor in the eyes of another actor. Mutual trust is seen as a set of expectations
shared by actors involved in interaction. This implies that trustworthiness and
trust is shaped in the mind of each specific actor, it is not merely given outside
people involved. The ontological assumption underlying this view is reality as a
product of individual construction. The view does not rule out that some
phenomena will be conceived as reality common to many people or everybody.
The assumptions concerning human nature are central in entrepreneurship
theory and the theories concerning entrepreneurship recapitulated above in
chapter 2 have various stances concerning whether entrepreneurship is
determined by the environment or not. The framework selected allows for the
individual's action based on her/his will, but does not preclude constraints and
influences due to situations and context.
The epistemological assumption is to see knowledge as more personal,
based on experience, and therefore differing between people. It is constructed to
a large extent in social interaction. However, extreme views in this line see
knowledge to be so personal that it can not be communicated between people or

<-----Page 64----->65

systems. That is not the stance of this study, which will be further commented
below.
Burrell & Morgan (1979) dichotomise assumptions concerning
methodology as nomothetic vs. ideographic. The former denotes as a main stance
the search for universal laws which explain and govern the reality observed.
Even if social sciences may not reach so far, the way to do it is by theorybuilding, where clarified and commonly accepted rules for theory-building
should be adhered to:
The scientific endeavour is likely to focus upon an analysis of relationships and
regularities between the various elements and with the discovery of ways in which these
relationships can be expressed. The methodological issues of importance are thus the
concepts themselves, their measurement and the identification of underlying themes
(Burrell & Morgan, 1979, p. 3).

The ideographic methodology, on the other hand, emphasises understanding of
what is unique and particular to the individual rather than what is general and
universal. Furthermore, the particular and individual may not at all be expressed
as commonalities between individuals.
Now we are coming to a central point of this study. It adheres to the
general view that reality formed in the minds of people, i.e. individually by
social construction. At the same time it is possible in research to identify patterns
and commonalities by interpretation (cf. the nomothetic view above). The
language provides us with the means for interpretation and identification of
commonalities. Patterns and commonalities can then form bases for further
knowledge building, by the same researcher or be communicated to others. The
research process can thus build theory out of a process of accumulation of individual knowledge and experience. At the same time, the interpretative research
process needs clarified and commonly accepted rules and procedures for theory
building, since knowledge accumulation builds on communicability and
acceptance of results between researchers. Research quality assessment needs
clarification of how studies are performed. For this combination of ontological
and methodological approach the study has found inspiration in the works of
Glaser & Strauss (1967), Lincoln & Guba (1985), Miles & Huberman (1994),
and Strauss & Corbin (1990).
These assumptions also lead to a basic view concerning the researcher. In
this study the researcher's role is to convey constructed realities, which is done
by interpretation (Schütz, 1967). The view underlying this study could be
depicted and in short explained as follows (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Role of the researcher
Different actors make sense of their "reality". The researcher studies and tries to
interpret the meaning of the actors' respective reality. The researcher uses theory
(frame of reference) and contributes by building concepts, models, with the aims
of building or refining theory. The researcher also attends to and interprets
meaning in phenomena directly from the field. All the double arrows in figure 1
indicate the process of sensemaking. We can also see in figure 1 that actors B
and N in a joint process attend to and construct meaning of the same phenomena.
(The researcher may also actively construct or impose meaning on phenomena in
the field in order to affect the actor's construction of reality. That would be action
research, which is not the aim of this study.) Implications of the approach
concerning research design and study performance will further be noticed below
in this chapter.

5. 2 Methods in the Study
5. 2. 1 Decision Bases for Study Design

<-----Page 66----->67

A research design is the logic that links the data to be collected (and the
conclusions to be drawn) to the initial questions of the study (Yin, 1989, p. 27).
The initial questions in the study are the study purpose and study issues as stated
in chapter 1. Also the basic assumptions come into play (see above) guiding how
the researcher interprets phenomena in the field of study. This section aims to
bridge a gap which otherwise may appear between research philosophy and
research practice. The research design must be suitable to study
- actors in action processes,
- how actors make sense of phenomena, and
- how action makes sense for the actors.
The study should allow for the researcher's interpretation, both for specific actors
or action and for patterns or other commonalities in data collected. This also
implies allowance for "sensitising concepts", concepts developed successively to
be filled with content in accordance (Blumer, 1954; cf. also the concept
theoretical sensitivity of Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Since there is very little earlier
research in the interface of entrepreneurial action processes and trust, the study
must be built on exploration, implying data collection which will be extended
successively during the study. All this indicates also a design and methods
applicable to predominately qualitative data being collected and analysed.
There are three sources of inspiration behind these standpoints: Symbolic
Interactionism, Grounded Theory and Naturalistic Inquiry. Since they are
guiding lines for performance of the study, we will give a short presentation of
each and also indicate what has and has not been important for the study.
Symbolic interactionism is a qualitative movement made known by
George Mead and Herbert Blumer at Chicago University (Joas , 1987). It stands
for the following:19
Ideographic research

studies to be based on understanding and
therefore necessarily small number of cases

Qualitative methods

in order to catch variation in the interpretative processes between people

Exploration

to reach a more complete understanding of
empirical data

19

The description is based on Alvesson & Sköldberg (1994).

<-----Page 67----->68

Social action

to be interactive, symbolic and intersubjective

Conceptual orientation

to get insight into new relations, perspectives and views. Sensitising concepts

Cognitive orientation

implies that meaning is cognitive rather than
emotional; every action has inner meaning
and outer behaviour

Empirical orientation

designed as induction by intensive study in
a mood of empathy, then comparison by
successively enlarged basis of theory

These principles form the basis for the study except for part of the
cognitive orientation. It is not the belief of this study that it is possible to
demarcate cognition (logos), emotion (pathos) and ethics (ethos) in research of
entrepreneurial action. Otherwise it is for the study an important view that action
has outer behaviour and inner meaning: Action is normally directed and
performed in a way that makes sense for the actor.
In later years grounded theory has become a most discussed line within
this movement with its founders Glaser & Strauss (1967). Grounded theory adds
to these general principles of interactionism ideas and a specific methodology
concerning data collection, interpretation and analysis procedures. Even if
grounded theory is a source of inspiration for the study there is no intention here
to describe grounded theory.20 Instead it is worth mentioning one point where the
study does not agree. Glaser and Strauss (1967) advocated not having prior
knowledge of the research field before a study.21 But, as we see it, having no
knowledge in an area will increase risks for misjudgement and biased views. An
investigator who is ignorant of earlier research and theories risks studying a
trivial problem, producing a copy of some earlier study or repeating others'
mistakes (Merriam, 1988, pp. 73-74).
The third source for inspiration is Lincoln & Guba (1985) with their
principles and methodology called naturalistic inquiry. They also adhere to the
set of principles discussed above. "Natural setting" for a study implies that no
20

See e.g. Glaser & Strauss (1967) or Strauss & Corbin (1990) for presentations of the
methodology.
21 Strauss has later modified his view. According to Strauss & Corbin: (1990, p. 42) one source
of theoretical sensitivity is literature, which "includes readings on theory, research and
documents (e.g. biographies, government publications) of various kinds. By having some
familiarity with these publications, you have a rich background of information that
'sensitizes'you to what is going on with the phenomenon you are studying".

<-----Page 68----->69

phenomenon can be understood without its relationship to contexts around it
(e.g. the new venture and its environment). "Purposive sampling" covers ideas
that non-statistic sampling design carried out with serial selection of sample units
could be the best way to get maximum variation in a sample. "Negotiated
outcome" is about relations researcher - respondents, and they discuss that facts
and interpretations that find their way into reports must be subjected to scrutiny
by respondents who earlier acted as sources for that information.

5. 2. 2 Case Study Design
This concept- and theory-building study can be related to study choice criteria in
Yin (1989, p. 21). He recommends case study when
the investigator's goal is to expand and generalise theories (analytic generalization) and
not to enumerate frequencies (statistical generalization).

Action concerns actors outside the new venture but focuses entrepreneurs
inside the new venture. The boundaries of the study are influenced by discovered
actions and subsequent interpretation during the study. Yin (1989, p. 23)
recommends case study when the researcher investigates a contemporary
phenomenon within its real-life context and boundaries between phenomenon
and context are not clearly evident.
One design issue is the choice of single-case or multiple-case design. In
order to build concepts by a study we wanted to cover different new venture
situations (cf. section 1.2 and section 5.5.1):
- capital intensity (resources crucial for trust)
- knowledge intensity (competence crucial for trust)
- different market situations, (a broad market versus narrow
market with different implications for trust).
It seemed impossible to cover these situations in one case. Therefore, a multiplecase was desirable, so designed that each case could produce different results for
predictable reasons, i.e. in Yin's terminology a theoretical replication. That is
also to say: as much variation in data as possible (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). On
the other hand the number of cases must be restricted to the limited resources for
the study. Below in this chapter the choices will be discussed and specific data
about selected cases will be presented.

<-----Page 69----->70

How to use cases is not self-evident but has to be related to an over-all
purpose. Stake (1994) discusses three main types of case study in connection
with research:
Intrinsic case study

the researcher wants better understanding of
a particular case. The case itself is in focus

Instrumental case study

the researcher studies a particular case to
provide insight into an issue or refinement
of a theory

Collective case study

the researcher studies a number of cases in
order to inquire into a phenomenon,
population or general condition

Understanding differs between the types. In an intrinsic case study understanding
the case itself is central. In the other two types understanding the case,-s is/are
instrumental to something outside the case per se. This concept-building case
study concerning trust could be labelled instrumental (focusing on theorybuilding concerning trust in action processes). Of its instrumental character
follows that understanding concerns 1) phenomena important for conceptbuilding concerning trust in action processes which should be prioritised before
other phenomena in the cases, and 2) that cases should be bounded to incorporate
phenomena important for trust for the case even if the phenomena would be
found outside, i.e. external actors.
The study of action process also calls for a sustained study period. Studies
of processes require a design that fits the important events over time (Yin, 1989).
4 to 6 years of business start and early development was estimated to be possible
and to cover development of relationships (cf. section 1.2.1). A longitudinal
study therefore becomes the natural choice. A study can be outlined as a
retrospective, simultaneous or a combination thereof. A simultaneous study of 4
to 6 years' length was outside the possible scope of the project. The decision thus
was a combination of simultaneous and retrospective study. The entrepreneurs
should have initiated their venture 2 to 4 years before the first interview and it
should be studied by recurring interviews with them and with important external
actors during another 2 years. In this way the desired time length of operations
would be covered. In section 5.4 the issue of retrospectiveness within the study
will be further discussed.

<-----Page 70----->71

5. 3 How the Study was Performed
This section will first give an account of how different issues concerning data
management: Collection, reduction, interpretation/analysis were resolved. Then
we describe the course of the pre-study and the main study.

<-----Page 71----->72

5. 3. 1 Data Management Issues: Collection,
Reduction, Interpretation and Analysis
A source of inspiration concerning data management is Miles & Huberman
(1994), who convincingly discuss and show how systematics and rigour could be
guidelines for research without loss of understanding and insight. They propose
and demonstrate a middle way between a totally impressionistic data handling
and an in detail pre-planned and rigorously performed collection and analysis.
An impressionistic data handling can promote new ideas for interpretation and
the discovery of unexpected actions and events, but may not be congruent with
the our view that communicability and credibility will be important in a conceptand theory building study. It aims at a language which could also be used in
studies outside the cases per se and by other researchers. So systematics and
rigour is a guiding line. In detail pre-planned and rigorously performed
collection and analysis may on the other hand obscure identification of patterns
and commonalities.

Data Collection
Qualitative data collection sources are mainly observation, interviews and
documents. Since the researcher's purpose is not to influence action (i.e. action
research), observation - only possible in the simultaneous part of the study would have to be performed with no interference with action process: passive
attendance in meetings and other communication. Most of the entrepreneurs'
communication with external actors during the study period would, from their
experiences, be telephone contacts and documents. Documents would be made
available to the researcher. Telephone contacts provide a number of problems:
They are often unplanned and done during travels. In addition, it is obviously
difficult to listen to both parties' argumentation on the telephone. Together, the
entrepreneurs and the researcher considered recurring planned interviews to be
adequate for data collection from the entrepreneurs. From external actors,
interviews and some requests for documentation were considered adequate.
The main purpose of the interviews was to acquire a bank of information
usable for interpretation of meaning ascription by the respondents, for building
concepts and identifying patterns in action. For the sake of bringing enrichment
and to identify unexpected and important results, there was a need for thickness
in data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 125). Thickness in data was of course
restricted by resources available for the study. Therefore the interviews had to be

<-----Page 72----->73

designed to make many analyses possible: Each interview must tell more than
one thing. But there were more purposes than the analyses. Apart from being
conducive to the specified research issues, they must give the researcher a
general insight into the companies, the industry niches served and general
environment for the company and entrepreneurship in the area. Interviews had
also a cross-checking purpose regarding earlier collected information and were a
forum to discuss the researcher's preliminary interpretations of earlier collected
information.

Data Reduction, Interpretation and Analysis
In a qualitative study data reduction, interpretation and analysis automatically
become intertwined as the researcher successively penetrates into the data (Miles
& Huberman, 1994, pp. 10-11). Interpretation of a rich material can take many
ways. The researcher needs guiding lines. This study is built around two:
Sensitising concepts and coding procedures.
Understanding is reflected in the language and we use linguistic means to
increase understanding. Concepts, model and theories are expressed in language.
So theory building - concepts, model and theories - is active use of linguistic
means to increase understanding. This is where sensitising concepts come in:
Concepts actively used to comprehend thinking, meaning, relationships etc.
Blumer (1954, p. 7) differentiates between definite and sensitising concepts. The
former refers to
precisely what is common to a class of objects, by the aid of a clear definition in terms of
attributes or fixed bench marks.

Sensitising concepts lack fixed attributes or bench marks. Instead, they give the
user a general sense of reference and guidance in approaching empirical
instances: What to look for more than what to see. Or as a guiding question:
What is relevant to look for?22 In the building of the frame of reference in the
chapters above a concept like person-based trust is used as a guiding line into the
empirical data, to provide clues and suggestions for data collection, data
reduction, analysis and presentation. Still, by a concept built on earlier theory it
is hoped to obtain benefits from other researchers' earlier experience (cf.
"theoretical sensitivity"; Strauss & Corbin, 1990, p. 41). The sensitising work
22

Concerning definite vs. sensitizing concepts compare also the different views on definitions
discussed in section 3.1. Definite concepts and ostensive definitions denote permanence,
stability and structure, whereas sensitizing concepts and performative definitions imply change,
transformation and processes.

<-----Page 73----->74

confirms or contradicts, qualifies and extends the concepts by bringing in
developed knowledge concerning phenomena in study. Inference from the
concrete instance to developed concepts and models is the approach.
An early decision concerning interpretation/analysis concerned how to
handle the volume of data, especially the need for different kinds of sorting and
clustering the data in order to identify patterns and commonalities. The standard
way is coding. This is a procedure where raw data are systematically transformed
and aggregated into units that permit precise descriptions of relevant content
characteristics (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Codes is by Miles & Huberman (1994)
defined as "tags or labels for assigning units of meaning to the descriptive or
inferential information compiled during a study" (p. 57). In our view coding
brings consistency to the data reduction, interpretation and analysis in four
possible ways: 1) codes can be deduced out of key concepts of the research
issues, thereby safeguarding adherence and sensitivity to the theoretical
framework, 2) codes work as guiding lines to reduction of data and to
understanding what is going on in the data, 3) codes with assigned data facilitate
discerning connections, i.e. patterns and relationships, and 4) codes developed by
confrontation with data can be the basis for new or developed concepts, models
and theories. Miles & Huberman (1994) identify three levels of coding:
Descriptive coding implies that you code superficially on recognition of
phenomena, i.e. facts etc. Interpretive coding means that you analyse behind the
act or event trying to discover motives etc. The third level is pattern coding,
where you identify emergent themes, configurations or explanations.
Successively applying the levels means getting more and more insights into the
data. Coding was therefore applied as a prominent feature in our analysis. It was
applied differently, though, in various stages in the work, as will be further
described in the next two sections.

5. 3. 2 The Pre-study
The main approach of the pre-study was to study six cases rather broadly in
order to investigate areas for further study within a general interest area in
entrepreneurial development.23 The first approach included a main focus on
characteristics of the new venture in the areas of relationships, competence and
trust, but also other distinguishing features of the new ventures. For the selection
the researcher turned to two organisations engaged in promoting entrepreneurs in
23

Some information about the six cases can be seen below in this chapter.

<-----Page 74----->75

new venture creation: The Regional Development Fund in Örebro County
(Utvecklingsfonden i Örebro län, later during the period of the study renamed
Almi Företagspartner AB) and the branch office in Örebro of The Jobs and
Society Association (Nyföretagarcentrum). Each of them provided the researcher
with a list of entrepreneurs/new ventures meeting our requirements of initiation 2
- 4 years earlier. The primary selection from the lists consisted of 8 companies,
which were contacted by telephone and asked if they were interested in being
interviewed. Seven were positive, the eighth was closing down. One of the seven
had started formally but not in reality. Since the aim was to get 4-6 new ventures
for the pre-study, all the remaining six were included.
One interview was prepared and performed for each of the new ventures.
The interviews were semi-structured and the questions covered the entrepreneurs'
background, basic ideas behind the new venture, the pre-start period, formal
start, activities and events so far, a little about the near future and expectations
for some years ahead. Each interview lasted around two hours. All six were
interviewed in March-April 1994. The entrepreneur performing the managing
director role was the respondent. The interviews were taped and written-up.
Brochures, company- and product descriptions, curriculum vitae's, newspaper
articles etc. were also collected. Respondents were given an opportunity to make
changes and give comments on the transcripts.
The data were analysed using qualitative methodology (Miles &
Huberman, 1994) to build preliminary concepts concerning competence, network
and trust, but also to display other distinguishing features of the new ventures.
Analysis of the six cases in transcript was done accordingly based on the
principle of coding (see also section 5.3.1). A coding scheme was successively
developed based mainly on the collected data. Manually, codes were attached to
sections or statements of the text. In the pre-study all codes were on the descriptive level. The purpose of this coding was threefold: 1) to identify areas of
interest for the deeper study, 2) to develop a coding scheme useful as a starting
point for more elaborated coding in the area of interest with the intention to
handle interpretations and pattern identification, and 3) to choose two new
ventures for the continued study.
As areas of primary interest the researcher judged it possible to continue
with a cognitive perspective of the new venture, relationship (network
perspective) or examine the role of trust for the new venture. Finally trust in
action processes was selected on two grounds: 1) the researcher's reading
indicated that there were few studies on new venture trust, and 2) there was
richness in case data concerning trust.

<-----Page 75----->76

5. 3. 3 The Main Study
The plan for the continued study was to use two of the cases. The researcher
wanted to cover different new venture situations as presented in section 5.2.2 and
to get as much variation as possible in data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Just one
new venture would not fulfill the demands. 3-4 new ventures would probably
give even more variation in data (Eisenhardt, 1989), but would have been outside
the scope of the project's limited resources to handle in time and volume. One
new venture (Explosive) was selected on the grounds that it is a knowledgeintensive and highly innovative technical consultant producing tailored solutions
to a few customers' needs. The second selection was a manufacturing company
producing goods in bulk for many, but exacting industrial customers (Plastics).
The selection of the two companies based on their characteristics and other facts
about the companies are described in section 5.5. Before final choice the
researcher checked once again with each of the entrepreneurs their willingness to
spare some hours in contacts with the researcher. The researcher also guaranteed
continued anonymity since the entrepreneurs considered that sensitive market
and relation information would be given. The researcher finally checked that
they would not disagree about the project plan to contact some of their
customers, suppliers, creditors and business advisors. The project got the OK
from both.
The next step was to use the collected data on these two companies again
for the deeper study. The aim now was to successively go from descriptive
coding to interpretive coding (Miles & Huberman, 1994) by going deeper into
the data. Some early reflections concerned how to perform the deeper analysis
and how to reduce time-consuming manual searching and combining of data.
Another factor was the anticipated increase in the volume of data being analysed.
Computer software has increasingly, also in qualitative research, become an aid
in data management, from simple text storage with word-for-word searching and
editing to indexing, categorising and linking of data. Therefore we looked for
adequate software to support the analysis. Some options were investigated.
Demo-versions of software packages tested led to the decision that the computer
software NUD*IST would suit the purposes best.24 The software package is
designed for data management and for creating and exploring new ideas and for
building theories/models. It does not determine the research approach, but rather
24

NUD*IST stands for Non-numerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing.
NUD*IST is developed by Qualitative Solutions and Research, La Trobe University, Australia.

<-----Page 76----->77

provides tools to support a range of tasks required for qualitative analysis. For
example
- store and retrieve document texts
- create, record, store and explore categories (cf. Glaser & Strauss, 1967)
- organise categories in a hierarchical system
- index categories in document text
- use the index system for different kinds of search and retrieval of
documents, linking, making reports
- write and handle memos to record ideas about documents and
categories
- develop categories for further analysis.
The transcripts were introduced into NUD*IST and the software was used to
mark text units, i.e. demarcate chunks of data. Text units were mainly one
statement in the interview, normally one question from the researcher together
with the response from the respondent (there are exceptions from this general
rule). The next step is the interpretation, i.e. coding of data. The old coding on
the first and second level from the pre-study concerning the two ventures was
revised and registered. Concepts, deduced from the research issues were used as
codes forming a coding scheme with Actor with subcategories and Trust with the
notions from the frame of reference as subcategories (cf. chapters 3 and 4). The
researcher worked repeatedly through the texts attaching relevant codes to text
units, thereby creating a reference base for interpreted empirical occurrences of
the different concepts.
The concepts in the beginning were rather broad notions supposed to
become more specified and sharpened by the interpretation/analysis. The method
was first to browse several times through the reference base of each node to
identify what was empirically going on. Expected and unexpected things were
identified. For example new aspects were detected widening the notion of
enterprise-based trust. The next step was to create new reference bases by
combining nodes, which for example brought the researcher's attention to
questions like: Which external actors tend to see trust as institution-based? The
software offers a variety of combinations using Boolean algebra. The work
continued with browsing combinations to detect and grasp for example how trust
came into the play for different external actors. So among other things some
complicated situations with so far non-included external actors were clearly seen,
such as authorities, mass media and technical consultants. Successively the
coding scheme was enlarged, encompassing new concepts.
Working with chunks of data in different selected reference bases started
processes of remarks, questions and ideas in the researcher's mind (this is the
human mind's work - not the computer's). These remarks etc. were noted in

<-----Page 77----->78

memos (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, Strauss & Corbin, 1990, and Miles &
Huberman, 1994) and were used in the analysis and as one basis for subsequent
report writing.
Above in section 5.3.1 was mentioned the coding levels of descriptive
coding and interpretative coding (Miles & Huberman, 1994) based on deepened
experience in the study. The presence of a specific actor in a situation is typically
descriptive coding denoting some fact in the data. Even if the already used codes
concerning trust bases are interpretative in character, the second research issue
oriented towards action processes contained much more interpretation of things
going on in processes over time. At the interpretative level the researcher by
using the empirical data identified different aspects, variations etc. which gave
more dimensions to the concepts, subconcepts or new combinations. To some
extent the reference bases of use trust and build trust (cf. chapter 7) could be
utilised, but interpretation of action processes required a more holistic view than
the precise text units of the software permitted. After a few coding attempts the
researcher instead used his earlier experience from management procedures
specification to get relevant overviews and later to communicate facts and
interpretations in cross-checking with the respondents. Action processes were
outlined in schemes containing activities, key events and trust as meaning
ascription during the processes. In a condensed form such schemes can be seen
in section 7.2. So far the work was intra-case analyses of each of the two new
ventures.
In October 1994 the second round of interviews with the two ventures was
performed. A semi-structured interview of two hours length was done with each
of the ventures. The aims were partly to collect more data of the new venture, i.e.
what had happened since the first interview and supplementary hard data
(concerning finance and resources). But the main aim was to discuss the
researcher's interpretations of their action processes and trust content. The
respondents were asked to assess whether they considered the researcher's interpretations to be correct and reasonable. They were also requested to give
supplementary or more correct data on the processes.
The analysis using both the old and the new data now began to focus the
actors' sensemaking of trust in action. Beliefs, interpretive schemes etc. were
identified (cf. chapter 8). The work with interpretation also started in the
researcher's mind a process of trial and error on how concepts are related and
patterns of e.g. action and meaning construction are discernible in the empirical
data. Inter-case analysis, using data from both cases, gave crude sketches to
concepts like trust "spill-over": trust reference, trust agent, and trust sign (cf.
chapter 8). The analysis started to reach the coding level of patterning: Pattern

<-----Page 78----->79

identification is even more inferential to see how the coding works on a more
integrated level. The computer software was now used less and less in order to
enable broader visions requiring synthetic thinking more than analytical
classification. Pattern identification grows out of the researcher's work with
sensitising concepts and data, the insights acquired by being extensively exposed
to the material. Pattern coding also implies looking from new angles at the earlier
interpreted results. Three steps can be distinguished in the pattern identification.
Firstly, memos written during the interpretation/analysis became one way of
systematically using ideas, hunches and observation from the earlier work.
Secondly, pattern coding was used, on a trial-and-error basis first, more
decidedly later on. Thirdly, recurrent discussions and cross-checking the pattern
ideas with respondents stabilised the picture. In this way the more abstract level
concepts emerged (cf. Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Miles & Huberman, 1994).
This ended the first part of the main study. Up to that point trust and
action process had been studied mainly as seen from the entrepreneurs' point of
view. The researcher had by then also got a fairly good picture of what action
processes had occurred and which were the important external actors around
each of the new ventures. The findings so far were summarised in three
conference papers. One concerned the concept building about trust. It was
discussed at EIASM's Research on Entrepreneurship VII workshop in Tampere
in November 1994. The second paper concerned trust and action processes. It
was presented at the Babson Conference on Entrepreneurship in London in April
1995. Finally, the researcher revised the content on the two papers due to
comments and combined them into a third one, which was presented and
discussed at the International Council for Small Business (ICSB) 40th World
Conference in Sydney in June 1995. Together with informal comments from
colleagues this ended peer reviews (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) in the first part of the
main study.
In the second part of the main study data collection was enlarged by
including key actors around the two ventures. Two customers, one supplier and
one financer of one of the selected firms, Plastics, were interviewed in spring
1995. The two customers represented industrial purchasers with different product
requirements and variation in how the action processes with Plastics had started.
The supplier was the largest raw material provider to the venture and the financer
was a definite key actor concerning financial trust for Plastics. In the spring of
1995 an interview was made with one customer of Explosive, the other selected
firm, which represented a third type of relationship between industrial customers
and new ventures. A business advisor, important for trust in Explosive in the
eyes of a wider range of actors and possible actors, was included. The selection

<-----Page 79----->80

of external actors was intended to enlarge possible variability in findings and
give richness in data (cf. the notion of theoretical sampling in Glaser & Strauss,
1967) within a limited number of interviews. A couple of interviews with other
business advisors and financers were performed to give the researcher a wider
picture of how these services were given by other providers. Interviews were
taped, written up and respondents were given an opportunity to give comments
and effect changes on the transcripts (negotiated outcome; Lincoln & Guba,
1985). As had been done with earlier data, the new data was introduced to the
qualitative analysis software to enable cross analyses between cases, concerning
trust, action processes and their patterns. Interpretation based on new data and
the earlier constructed concepts confirmed earlier conclusions or gave
successively more content to concepts and patterns concerning trust bases
(mainly in chapter 6), the concepts and patterns concerning trust in action
processes (mainly in chapter 7) and intermediaries for trust and strategies in
sensemaking trust (chapter 8). In the end of 1995 the final round of interviews
was conducted with the entrepreneurs. The latest evolution of the action
processes were presented by the entrepreneurs, facts and interpretations in drafts
were checked etc. (negotiated outcome; Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
During the study all write-ups were returned for scrutiny by and
comments from the respondents. In some instances they remarked on wording or
technical vocabulary, which led to changes in documentation. The low number
of comments is probably due to the fact that all interviews were taped and
completely written up, which the respondents could clearly see. The researcher's
interpretation concerning each actor's action and meaning behind action was presented to the respondents, who could verify, bring nuances and complementary
information or reject the interpretation. A couple of preliminary interpretations
concerning meaning of specific actions were rejected and therefore discarded
from further analysis. For some others additional information enriched further
analysis.
In all, for the pre-study and main study 18 interviews (See list in
appendix) were performed and transcripts amount to 340 pages, to which should
also be added documentation provided by the ventures and external actors,
newspaper articles etc. Before this monograph, two working papers summarising
state-of-the-project were produced, in the end of 1994 and 1995 respectively.
These working papers were presented and discussed at faculty seminars.

5. 4 Quality Assessment

<-----Page 80----->81

One ultimate quality of a study is whether other people, researchers and
practitioners, find that the ways to results make sense. For the present study the
language in form of concepts should convey insights and invite researchers to
use and further develop them. How can we tell if the study is performed in such a
way that the results will be good enough for making sense?
In predominately quantitative study the terms of validity and reliability
mean precise contents in construct, operationalisation of variables, exactness in
relation, instrument precision (cf. Lincoln & Guba, 1985). In a mainly qualitative
study high complexity of data is focused, rather than low complexity enabling
frequencies of data. Validity and reliability in a qualitative study do not
generally reside in measurement. Common for any study, irrespective of its kind
of data, is the basic needs to convey credibility in the study and its results. Some
researchers use the terms validity and reliability in qualitatively oriented studies
and give them other definitions. Others have developed concepts covering the
essential purposes behind reliability and validity to prevent face resemblance
with the traditional notions. Attempts up to now have resulted in a diversity of
such concepts, although not so diverse in views.25 An evaluation of this diversity
is outside the scope of this study. This study has adopted quality assessment
criteria based on its own basic assumptions and uses the four assessment
concepts of Brytting (1991), which seem to be fruitful for an explorative,
qualitative, interpretive and concept building study. These assessment criteria
are: Accuracy, reliability, theoretical linkage and generative capacity. For the
four assessment concepts we were also inspired by discussions in Lincoln &
Guba (1985), who have a similar classification.

Accuracy
Accuracy is to carry out the study in such a way that the findings can be
approved by the constructors of the multiple reality studied. The respondents
should for example recognize contents and wording in write-ups from interviews
in which they have taken part. The second issue is researcher's interpretations
from this data being close to the original wording. With a specific research issue
and purpose of study in mind the researcher always runs the risk of overinterpreting phenomena in the direction of issue and purpose. For this study there
is a risk of identifying actor's trust in the data when trust was not making sense
25 Examples of studies and books on methodology using or proposing different terminology:
Brytting (1991); Färnström & Kedström (1975); Lincoln & Guba (1985); Miles & Huberman
(1994).

<-----Page 81----->82

for action. Such a risk can never be completely eliminated, but it can be
effectively reduced by adherence to three rules in handling data:
1) The researcher must be aware of the risk and be self-critical e.g. by constantly
asking "Does this really make sense? Is this expressed meaning really so
important?" These questions may lead to necessary re-interpretation.
2) Submit preliminary interpretations to the respondents. They should be given
the opportunity to confirm or reject interpretations concerning phenomena to
which they have close access. If they reject, the interpretation should normally
be discarded. But there is also the researcher's interpretation of a more general
scope, concerning for example several actions and several actors involved.
Sensemaking of this order concerning commonalities such as patterns of action
and sensemaking grows out of the researcher's experience from the case and
should be considered to be the researcher's responsibility towards results (see
section 5.3.3).
3) Discuss interpretations in peer groups and with fellow researchers. Working
papers presented in different seminars with prepared discussants is a good way
for scrutiny (see section 5.3.3).
Apart from respondent review, "negotiated outcome" in Lincoln & Guba's
(1985) terminology, the authors recommend prolonged engagement, persistent
observation and triangulation of sources, methods and investigators. Prolonged
engagement is attained by the longitudinal study design, which enables a check
against temporary phenomena dominating collected data and makes reflections
on events and actions possible. Recurrent interviews were partly used to check
earlier data and to collect what was new since the preceding interview.
Persistency was regarded in that way. Triangulation is in books on methodology
often recommended but not often applied in practice, probably due to costs
involved. Triangulation could not be introduced is this study, but different
sources were used to cross-check action processes, since both a focal actor and at
least one external actor were involved. They were interviewed separately. This
latter is also a matter of reliability.

Reliability
Reliability in a qualitative study may be given a sense covering replicability,
instrumental unreliability due to human factors, such as fatigue, tendency to

<-----Page 82----->83

make mistakes etc. Replicability is to a large extent based on a clear-cut frame of
reference for the study, which at least makes it possible to conduct similar
studies for comparison. We have devoted extensive discussion to outline the
frame of reference in the chapters 1 - 4 above to enable the readers to assess
replicability potentials.
As to human factors, one important source for making mistakes is time
between an event and the study of the event. The study was performed during a
shorter span of time than the studied period of business start-up and early
development for the two cases in the main study (cf. section 5.3.3). This
highlights reliability concerning retrospectiveness.26 Approximately four years
were covered retrospectively and two years simultaneously. By retrospectiveness
is here meant the difference between the respondent's sensemaking at the time of
a specific event and the time when the respondent in an interview was asked to
describe her/his sensemaking at the time of the specific event. The time-lag may
impose problems of reliability due to the following factors (Thurén, 1986, ch. 3):
People just forget, meaning can be influenced by sheer wish to forget something
unpleasant, or they have a desire to be different from before. Furthermore,
combined with oblivion people may add new details and restructure their
memory-pictures. Such rationalisations can be conscious or unconscious. The
length of the time-lag is also important. The longer the retrospectiveness the
more biases may occur due to the factors. On the other hand, according to
Thurén (1986, p. 29):
people remember better what they are interested in, what is useful for them and what is
congruent with their values, and - not least - significant roles of their own in a setting,
particularly if the circumstances are flattering (translated from Swedish).

This may account for the detailed and accurate descriptions entrepreneurs often
give regarding how their new venture started. Even so, this will not necessarily
preclude biases.
In the present study retrospectiveness may concern a) facts and events, b)
action (own or another actor's), and c) meaning in action. Potential biases due to
retrospectiveness have been considered and handled as follows:

26

Due to ontological paradigm there are also different views on the signification and
consequences of retrospectiveness. A less objectivistic view seems to go along with less
signification. Weick (1979; 1995) sees all sensemaking as subject to retrospectiveness, i.e. it is
not possiible for an actor to distinguish in a specific situation between sensemaking earlier
experience and sensemaking the situation as original. For Weick retrospectiveness is always a
prominent datum in interpretation. The present study agrees on the view but assumes in
accordance with the presented discussion that it may be possible to discern retrospectiveness
after the event.

<-----Page 83----->84

a) important facts and events, i.e. numbers, points of time, and order of events
have been cross-checked with documents and with statements of other actors
involved (cf. previous section). These cross-checkings have been performed on
separate occasions, not involving the first source of information.
b) the unfolding of actions studied has been described by two parties involved,
irrespective of one another. On a few occasions slight differences appeared,
which have been straightened out if being important for the analysis.
Cross-checking done in these ways should reduce biases.
c) for meaning in action we can use our view that meaning interplays with
attention, basic values and beliefs, and interpretive schemes. Retrospectiveness
in attention is difficult to cross-check if the same facts for attention were not
been brought in by another actor. So there remains a source for bias concerning
e.g. how one actor looked upon the other actor at their first meeting. Basic values
and beliefs tend to be stable over time which would imply that there should be
no or little difference during the retrospectiveness period (Schein, 1992; cf. also
note in section 3.2.4; Thurén 1986, p. 29). So for example when one actor
contends that the other seemed to be reliable for dealing with, the expressed
general belief in reliability in business will probably not be very different in
retrospect for that actor. Interpretive schemes as based on experience tend also to
be stable over time, but may be affected by accommodation. So changes may - at
least in theory - be discernible as changes in interpretive schemes due to enlarged
experience. However, most experience tends to be assimilated, moulded into the
form of already existing schemes, in which case meaning in interpretive schemes
will probably not be very different in retrospect. In practical work with
interpretation the distinction between assimilation and accommodation does not
appear as clear-cut as in theory, though. Sometimes retrospectiveness in
respondents' reasoning can be detected as inconsistencies.
The conclusion of the discussion concerning retrospectiveness is that
biases concerning facts, events and actions can be controlled to a large extent.
Biases in meaning can not be effectively controlled, only judged by reason after
collecting a wide range of data concerning the situation. Another way is making
the respondent aware of possible biases and thereby enable him/her to make the
distinctions in memory pictures. The study design with multiple information providers concerning the same information, recurrent interviews with partly
overlapping discussions gives important opportunities for assessment concerning

<-----Page 84----->85

retrospectiveness. Throughout the study, inconsistencies involving retrospective
phenomena have been few. Either they really are few or they remain undetected.

<-----Page 85----->86

Theoretical Linkage
The third assessment criterion for a concept building study depends to a large
extent on whether there is a base of theory to build on. If not, or if the researcher
intends to build theory irrespective of theory that exists, the principles of
grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) would be appropriate. Now, this study
takes the position that theoretical linkage (cf. Brytting 1991) is a principle
guiding the study. New concepts and further theory building should therefore be
related to existing theory. As the reader has seen in chapters 2 - 4 there is
existing relevant theory concerning the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship, action
processes and trust. Theoretical linkage also implies conclusions about the study
results, i.e. in what way the results complement or supplement existing theory.
This will be a theme in chapter 9 together with other implications of the study.

Generative Capacity
The fourth assessment criterion is that a study should bring additions to existing
knowledge. The results of a concept building study should be useful in other
studies contingent upon the judgement of the researcher and others, whether
setting and circumstances allow it. Its generative capacity can be to a large
extent monitored by the selection of concepts, models and theories to be
confronted with empirical knowledge, together with data collection,
analysis/interpretation guided to bring extended or revised knowledge (cf.
Brytting, 1991). Generative capacity will be discussed in chapter 9 together with
other implications of the study.

5. 5 The Cases
5. 5. 1 The Six New Ventures in the Pre-study
For the pre-study the six ventures were selected in February and March 1994
with the characteristics in common discussed above in previous chapters. First,
they should be new ventures, operate on a market, the entrepreneur should be
committed to it by working full time and should by him/her be seen as a
permanent venture, not a temporary one. Second, among them there should be
manufacturing firms, where finance and capital provision is important, and also

<-----Page 86----->87

knowledge-intensive firms, in which competence and competence development
could be an issue. The mixture of ventures should also reflect different market
situations: some of them dependent on a large number of customers, some on a
few and consequently each one important. Some basic data on the ventures of the
pre-study are summarised in Table 1. Since some requested anonymity, which
was guaranteed, the names are constructed. In Table 1 some basic information
about the new ventures in the pre-study is displayed.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter data collected from the pre-study
cases were important for building sensitising concepts. They also formed a base
of six new ventures from which those for the main study were selected. Selection
for a theory- and concept building study is generally based on acquiring as much
variation as possible in the data enabling richness in interpretation and thereby
content of concepts (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Explosive
and Plastics together cover the important characteristics (see also section 5.2.2).
In Table 2 all companies are characterised according to how important the
selection criteria above are for their development as interpreted from the
interviews.

5. 5. 2 The Two New Ventures and External Actors in
Main Study

the

The main study included two companies and some of their external actors.
Criteria for the choice are presented above, needed here only to indicate that
Explosive was selected on the ground that it is a knowledge-intensive and highly
innovative technical consultant producing tailored solutions to a few customers'
needs. The second selection was Plastics, a manufacturing company producing
goods in bulk for many, but exacting industrial customers. The covering of
different venture situations in type of production, market and capital needs is the
primary reason for the selection. In Table 2 it is possible to see that the two
selected new ventures together covered the important criteria.

A Note on Case Descriptions
The following sections aim at giving a description for the reader of the two new
ventures studied. A case description can be made for many purposes and in many
ways, though. Therefore thoughts about case description in this particular study
will now be discussed. The first task is to give a reasonable account of the
phenomena observed, that is to give an over-all account of the cases: Important
facts, such as background of the entrepreneurs, types of products, market and
basic data about the emerging enterprise. Such an account is contingent on the
account teller's thoughts regarding the reader's interest concerning the cases. This
account is given on a general level with the usual types of data when a company
is presented, and the aim is to give the reader a broad notion of the new ventures,
a short and concentrated description. By doing that other aims with the
description are sacrificed or not attained. A description in a study should also
contain data displays that are focused on the research issues. That is, the multitude of data should be arranged in a way to permit connection to the analysis. In

<-----Page 89----->90

this way a description can form a bridge between the research issues and
subsequent detailed treatment of collected data. Hopefully, this will enable the
reader to assess the potential of the cases in connection with stated research
issues. This kind of description will also facilitate for the researcher to analyse in
accordance with research issues and identify what further analyses are called for
during the work. The second task is therefore to account for the new ventures
applying the perspective of organising by action processes.
The two case descriptions below are based on documentation and the
interviews with the entrepreneur performing the role of managing director in
each company.

5. 5. 2. 1 Explosive Inc.
Explosive was started in 1990 by three engineers working in one of the largest
chemical companies in Sweden, below called Incubator Inc. Two of the
entrepreneurs are chemists and one is a mechanical engineer. They knew each
other very well and had worked in Incubator for 30 years, i.e. most of their
careers. All had worked together with different aspects of pyrotechnics, and were
specialised in a field in which very few people in Sweden are experts. Incubator,
which is a diversified group of companies, was at this time, in the end of the
1980's, changing its strategy. The purpose was to specialise more deeply into its
chemical core business. The line of pyrotechnics, which had been developed by
the three engineers, did not belong to the core business. Managers in Incubator
mentioned this line of product as one of those that were not going to be
important for Incubator in the future. But there was no immediate danger of the
three engineers losing their jobs in Incubator.
The three engineers had developed know-how and products for which
they could see a market and thought it would be wrong to "put the products in
the grave", as one of them expressed it. Instead they said to themselves: "Would
it not be possible for us to take over this business on our own?" And they did so.
They outlined the market, products and general ideas on how the company
should work. None of them had any experience of running a business of their
own, but one of them went to a course on "Start-your-own-business". Actually
they were familiar with their main market since their employment in Incubator.
To begin with they continued product development started already in Incubator.
They could e.g. bring a patent with them. They were well-known in the industry,
and at the beginning very often connected with Incubator. But since they were
new in running a business of their own and a company, they looked for support.

<-----Page 90----->91

Relations were developed with The Regional Development Fund (Almi) in
Örebro County, which gave them advice in commercial matters and has also
supported them in other ways.27 But Explosive has no venture capital from Almi,
which is otherwise one common support of Almi. Explosive also participates in a
network of entrepreneurs in its municipality. The activities of this network are
seminars and study tours etc. on matters useful for business, especially new
ventures.
The business idea is to develop tailored solutions to industrial customers'
needs in the chemical area where the venture has competence. This means to
design, construct and test a theoretical solution. Depending on customer's needs
they can also make prototypes and small series of products. But they do not
manufacture a product once it is developed. Their customers are mostly wellknown and large Swedish industrial companies (not Incubator, though). To them
Explosive is a consultant in chemical problem solutions and product
development. The size of the jobs vary from small and insignificant (in revenue)
to a couple of large jobs, that have been very important for Explosive, both in
terms of future business and financially. In periods doing large jobs Explosive
can become rather dependent on the customer. Each job is individual in scope
and content.
The basis for Explosive is a small number of customers. In the end of
1994 the company had five regular customers (with recurrent orders) of which
only two are very significant in number of orders as well as in volume. As
competence-based and having no scale production suppliers are not important.
The company also sticks to one bank connection. Characteristic for Explosive's
network is bilateral relationships for its sales and a large and complex network
for development of business ideas.
The venture is based on the chemical competence of the engineers,
products emanate from that competence combined with the needs of each
customer. This has up to the end of 1994 resulted in 15 patents, owned by either
the customer or Explosive. If Explosive is the owner the patent is usually sold
against contract on further development work for Explosive or against royalty on
sales of the manufacturing company. Their products are inventions, and three of
them have been nominated for awards in national invention contests.
Explosive has during the period of research three employees (apart from
the three entrepreneurs/owners). They are young engineers, two in chemistry and
one in mechanics. One of the chemists is also trained in computer programming.
27

RDF is now reorganized under the name of Almi Företagspartner AB. See also below in this
chapter, where Almi is presented as external actor.

<-----Page 91----->92

They came to Explosives to do specified parts of project work and in the
meantime learn more of the specific know-how of Explosive. Since there is no
school in Sweden covering pyrotechnic chemistry, they have to learn it on site.
Gradually they will become responsible for projects.
Explosive rents a small building in the grounds of a company in the
Incubator group, which also provides janitorial services. Upstairs is the office
with computers, drawing-office, archives for technical specifications, drawings
and patent information. Downstairs are two small laboratories, one chemical and
one mechanical. They have several instruments of their own for construction
work and measurement. They can also still use laboratory equipment at
Incubator's laboratories. Whenever necessary, they buy specialised laboratory
and similar services from other sources.
Financially, Explosive is run on the principle of funding with owner's
capital and retained earnings. It avoids long-term liabilities. A small long term
loan from the National Swedish Board for Technical Development (NUTEK) for
financing a large project has been repaid in advance. In Table 3 can be seen
some data and financial indicators about the company since its start. Turn-over
and profit have steadily increased. Current assets are steadily higher than current
liabilities which makes the liquidity measured in working capital well above 100
%. Retained earnings and decreasing liabilities in 1993/94 make the equity ratio
increase. In the summer of 1994, immediately at the start of the fiscal year of
1994/95 the company repaid its long-term debts which was a goal. The second
goal was attaining 50 % in equity ratio, which was then also accomplished.

Postscript
In the middle of 1995, two of the entrepreneurs retired at the age of 67. The
remaining entrepreneur chose not to take over all on his own. Instead he
accepted a take-over bid from Incubator, which at that time had changed its
strategy to include the line of chemistry represented by Explosive. Explosive
became a subsidiary company in the Incubator group. The entrepreneur is still
managing director in the company. Its line of business, as described above, is
unchanged, but for the future product development requiring a level of funding
which the Incubator group can provide is foreseen.

5. 5. 2. 2 Plastics Inc.
Plastics was founded in 1990 by two entrepreneurs, but one of them left the new
venture after a short time. The remaining entrepreneur was born in a nearby town
as the son of a local industrialist. His parents and grandparents, as well as his
wife's, were families of entrepreneurs and industrialists, active in the region. The
entrepreneur's father had a firm making plastic components, but since none of the
growing children at that time seemed interested in taking over, the firm was sold
and a little later closed down. The future entrepreneur worked as a young man in
his father's firm but decided on a technical education. He first became a civil
engineer in mechanics, then continued his education and went into research in
plastic chemistry. After attaining the degree of Doctor of Technology he worked
for a short time in a plastic company situated in the big city where he had
studied. But he and his family wanted to return to the neighbourhood where they
were born. For him it also meant the chance to start a new business with much
moral and practical support from people in the area. He started Plastics, based on

<-----Page 93----->94

the idea to develop and manufacture high-quality plastic components for
industrial use. The combination of developing and manufacturing is unusual in
one and the same company in that industry, but he believes that Plastics should
be based on the entrepreneur's knowledge of Technology. He considers this to be
a competitive advantage.
Customers are well-known industrial companies in different Swedish
industries. What they have in common is their need for qualities like acidresistance, durability etc. for these components, used in their production
processes and products going to their customers. But Plastics also makes
standard components, as a way to be a full range supplier and to get new
customers. As components in exported products, a large proportion of Plastics'
products goes on to indirect export. Plastics seeks competitive advantage in
certification of its products. Its demanding industrial customers often require
product certificates, which in many instances is more important than price.
Product certificates can for Plastics in this way ward off competitors that have
not attained the certification standard. Standards are based on the
recommendations of a United Nations committee. Products are tested by a
Swedish agency (Statens provningsanstalt), which also issues certificates.
There are a number of external actors with which Plastics has developed
relationships. In the middle of 1995 the company had between 25 and 30 regular
customers (i.e. that have bought from Plastics more than once). Plastics has three
regular suppliers of raw material (plastics in bulk) as well as various special
suppliers for specific details. The company also sticks to one bank connection
plus Almi for loans. Characteristic for Plastics' network is bilateral relationships
for most business deals, i.e. one customer or supplier at a time.
Plastics is situated in a small village, earlier dominated by a mining
company, that has now reduced its activities and left the village. Plastics bought
a large barn - one of the left-over facilities of the mining company - and rebuilt it
to suit its industrial manufacturing and storing needs. Two large rooms are
occupied by four machines for the component production. There is a storing
room for the plastic raw material. A large room is used to store final products.
On the upper floor is the office, three small rooms and in the attic of the former
barn a conference room. In the summer of 1994 Plastics bought another building,
some miles away but close to the entrepreneur's own house. One of the
machines, suitable for automatic production, was moved over and is run by the
entrepreneur himself "passing by before and after work".
The production philosophy runs like this: One aspiration is low manual
operating time per produced unit. In practice, one operator should handle two
machines. Efficient store handling and machine service is another principle. At

<-----Page 94----->95

the same time good working environment is sought. Second-hand machines are
bought in order not to increase debt more than necessary. At the same time these
should be modern machines, i.e. flexible for production of different products
with low degree of manual operation and high production per time unit. All this
combined takes of course much investigation to obtain the right equipment.
Machines have been bought in central Europe and sent to Sweden. Buying the
right machine is a strategic decision, since it can open up for new products and
customers.
Apart from the entrepreneur (at the start they were two, but one left after a
short time and his shares were bought by the remaining entrepreneur) five
employees have come to the company, to work in the two-shift production. Since
the autumn of 1994, number six, a part-time clerk has been employed for office
work. An increase in production volume is managed by organising production in
three shifts together with less operating time on each machine, i.e. productivity
increases. Different measures have also been taken to reduce the constant
problem of vulnerability, due to illness, vacation and similar causes.
The standardised raw material is bought in bulk on an international market
with oligopoly characteristics. A few large companies dominate as sellers and the
buyers are many and smaller. Raw material prices are sensitive to changes in oil
prices. Price changes in raw material give clear repercussions downstream.
Plastics uses three suppliers. A comparatively large amount of capital is bound in
stocks of raw material and final products. Due to requirements of the industrial
customers and competition prompt deliveries are often necessary, even delivery
on the same day as the order is received. As is usual for a manufacturing firm,
Plastics has great needs of capital, which is ploughed down in buildings,
equipment and material. A strategic competitive necessity is also new
investments, requiring new funds. A new venture in manufacturing cannot
generally rely on retained earnings. Even if the entrepreneur commits a large
amount of owner's capital - as he did - this is seldom sufficient. Large loans
become a necessity. But since the future of Plastics could be judged as unclear actually he started in a period when there was a general overcapacity in the
industry - there is a need for venture capital with risks above normal bank risk.
In this case Almi went in with venture capital enough to enable the bank to
contribute with loans with preferential repayment rights and therefore lower
risks.
As can be seen in Table 4 Plastics has had an increasing turnover and
profit before depreciation and taxes. But the company needed large investments
in fixed assets, which has had to be financed by long-term liabilities. The
positive development of turnover and profit before depreciation is almost wiped

<-----Page 95----->96

out when costs for capital and depreciation are added. Consequently, the large
amount of liabilities in combination with low build-up of equity results in an
extremely low equity ratio. The financial strategy of Plastics is to use the stillincreasing turnover to generate own funds for its investment needs, then in the
future to repay debts. Liquidity measured in working capital has been good
considering the general financial circumstances, which indicates a financially
well-run company.

Postscript
During 1995 expansion has continued, both sales to existing customers and to
new ones. A new range of products, using soft plastics has been developed and is
mainly sold on export. Acquisition of additional machinery is planned and a
new, supplementary factory building will be erected. The number of employees
is 11 in the end of 1995.

5. 5. 2. 3 External Actors of the Two New Ventures
The selection criteria for the external actors were presented in section 5.3.3. Each
of the external actors was interviewed in one interview in the middle of 1995.
The interviews lasted 2 hours. Respondents were the persons with whom the
entrepreneur made the initial agreement. These persons have in all five
companies also continued relations with the entrepreneur in important matters,
such as agreements, policy discussions for agreements, evaluation of
performances and large events with implications on relations. The five external
actors are the following28:

See also section 5.3.3. The selection was guided by a need to cover variation in customer
relationships due to different product requirements and how the relation started. Furthermore,
only the manufacturing new ventures has important supplier relationships.

<-----Page 97----->98

Plastics' customer Alpha is a small company with some 15 million Sw. Kronor in
turnover and 8-9 employees in 1995. It is a subsidiary to a large multinational
manufacturer in steel. It also has a number of sister companies in Sweden. Alpha
has a specific niche in manufacturing chemicals for surface treatment of highquality steel. Its chemicals are sold world-wide. Its products are classified by law
as environmentally hazardous products, requiring special handling in transport
and usage. The company has operated since the 1960's.

Beta
Plastics' customer Beta is a Swedish company within a large European business
group. It has a history as an independent family enterprise since the 1950's. Beta
specialises in the manufacture of decorative coating, i.e. paints for the building
industry and other professional use. Purchase of packing, such as containers, is
done on a large scale since the company's purchasing officers also serve sister
companies in some other countries. The company works with a large number of
suppliers. Purchase activities and procedures are to be standardised and efficient.
In 1994 total purchases of packing amounted to 53 million Sw. kronor.

Gamma
Explosive's customer Gamma is a Swedish company manufacturing detonators
for explosive charges. The company has existed since the beginning of the
century and had in 1994 close to 500 employees. Today it is owned by a larger
company abroad in the same industry. Gamma's policy is to be the world's
leading company in its niche and was actually the first to change over to a
detonator construction using chemicals less hazardous for the environment and
safer in both production and use. Safety is mainly attained by more strictly
monitoring the time before the detonator's explosion. Product development requires advanced pyrotechnic competence.

<-----Page 98----->99

Delta
Plastics' supplier Delta has since 1970 been a sales and distribution company for
polyethylenes in bulk in Sweden and Finland. Delta belongs to a large worldwide company in petrochemistry, in which polyethylenes is a small part of its
total operations. The manufacturing plant for polyethylenes is located in a
European country so Delta is also an importer. Delta has a sales turn-over in
1995 of 577 million Skr, which is a market share of 5 % of the whole range of
polyethylenes sold in Sweden. There are about 10-15 supplying competitors in
Sweden: 5 from European countries and 5-10 from other countries.

Almi Företagspartner
Almi Företagspartner is a Swedish organisation established to promote new
enterprise and to develop small and medium-sized enterprises. Support in the
establishment of new enterprises can be given in two ways: 1) By capital
provision to develop business ideas, productivity and competitiveness, and 2) In
the form of consultant services based on general business competence and
experience. Almi Företagspartner is jointly owned by the state, the Swedish
Trade Council and a number of trade and business organisations. In each county
the organisation has a subsidiary with consultants working with the support.
A further description of each company's relationship to and action
processes with Explosive and Plastics is given in chapter 7.

5. 6 Conclusions Concerning Methodology for the
Study
A study of actors' meaning in action requires a number of methodological
decisions stated in this chapter. The first point of departure is that the study aims
at building concepts based on empirics in order to contribute to theory. Such a
concept-building approach implies three conditions: 1) richness in data is
required 2) data must emanate from the field, i.e. an inductive approach.
Richness in field data is mainly provided in case studies 3) the study design is
guided to evolve successively in accordance with the need for data for the
concept building.

<-----Page 99----->100

The second point of departure is that the study area concerns action
processes in which actors are involved. Action is governed by actors' meanings.
This implies two conditions: 1) understanding actors' sensemaking is necessary
2) this understanding is attained by interpretation of the actors' accounts.
The methodology and consequently the performance of the study can be
summarised as depicted in Figure 2. The theoretical analysis in chapters 2 - 4 is
directed towards forming some provisional sensitising concepts, such as the
entrepreneur, action process, meaning, interpretive schemes, trustworthiness,
mutual trust and the different bases of trust. These concepts are used as a guiding
line into the empirics, to provide clues and suggestions for data collection, data
reduction, analysis and presentation. They are confronted with the empirical data
to confirm or contradict, qualify and extend the content of the concepts. They
work as triggering clues bringing an understanding that will in its turn permit
development of new or revised concepts and induce patterns in the data. By
using the empirical revised or induced concepts, patterns of action and
interpretive schemes can then be related to theory in order to state and discuss
contribution to theory, suggestions for further research and other implications.
Chapter 6 will thus be dedicated to development of the concepts
concerning bases of trust as an empirical answer to corresponding theoretical
implications in section 4.4. In chapter 7 the concepts of trustworthiness and
mutual trust (cf. section 4.4) are extended into a number of new concepts by
studies of action processes in the cases. Chapter 8 induces patterns in the data
and concepts denoting construction of trust in action processes involving not
only truster and trustee but also intermediaries. It extends the concepts in the
theoretical framework presented in section 4.4. Chapter 9 summarises the
concept development and pattern induction in terms of contribution to theory and
practice. The methodology described in this section is summarised and illustrated
in Figure 2.

Chapter 6

Bases for Actors' Sensemaking of Trust
6. 1 Introduction
The main reason for doing the case analysis underlying this chapter is the
research issue What are the external actors' bases for trust in the entrepreneur
and the new venture? 29 The sensitising concepts built and presented in section
4.4 have been confronted with the interview data to confirm or contradict,
qualify and extend concepts. The results are summarised in content dimensions
to each trust base reflecting our interpretation of the data attached to the coded
concept (cf. section 5.3.3). In focus will be what the external actors have
expressed and what are their clues to trust concerning the entrepreneurs and new
ventures. To some extent the entrepreneurs have also expressed knowledge or
opinions of actors' trust, which can then be used for comparison. Trust covers
trustworthiness in the eyes of the external actor or mutual trust when indicated.
As a tool for the data handling a computerised qualitative data program
was used (NUD*IST; cf. chapter 5). The bases and dimensions should not be
seen as a classification scheme but as conceptual tools for understanding actors'
view and action.30 And, as with all interpretations, the interpreter's (researcher's)
perception comes into the play.31

<-----Page 102----->103

6. 2 Person-based Trustworthiness
Person-based trustworthiness is expectations about an entrepreneur due to her/his
- personal characteristics, such as motivation, self-assurance
etc.
- competence and experience, appropriate education/training
and/or industry experience
- managerial and/or commercial capacity to manage business
and a firm, including creating and keeping relationships
to that
end.

6. 2. 1 Personal Characteristics
Personality traits and characteristics is one way of external actors' clue-seeking
for trustworthiness. The dimension covers the entrepreneur's motivation for
doing business, her/his self-assurance, seriousness and honesty in business and
towards actors in action processes.
Motivation concerns the entrepreneurs' willingness to give quick, accurate
and reliable responses to external actors questions and requests concerning
matters that needed investigation and reflection on the part of the entrepreneur.
Such responses are for example
- what product development could be performed,
- when products could be delivered.
As the entrepreneurs saw it, interaction implied conveying assurance to the
external actor that the entrepreneur is reliable and would be so in future
interaction. And the external actors looked for signs showing the entrepreneur's
efforts to fulfill engagements and promises. That is giving clues and noticing
them. One of Plastics' customers, Beta, explicitly noted that the entrepreneur
often calls or pays a visit when passing by to check that shipments have duly
arrived, even if he has no reason to fear delays. "Things like that makes us feel
confident in relations to him and his firm." (10)32 The entrepreneur displays
motivation for the relationship, which gives the other party a feeling of trust.
Self-assurance is i.a. when the entrepreneur conveys impression of
personal drive to get things done. Commenting on the first contacts between
Plastics and Alpha the latter stressed as part of trustworthiness that the
entrepreneur gave quick and accurate responses to questions and also
32

A number by an interview quotation refers to its number on the interview list. See appendix.

<-----Page 103----->104

immediately fulfilled what was required. Under these circumstances the
responses came to imply trust.
Close to these motivational and self-assurance aspects comes whether the
entrepreneur is seen as serious and honest, i.e. that the entrepreneur only gives
assurances of things that s/he is sure to live up to. A purchasing officer:
New contacts with new firms, that we do not know, are risky. They promise much
because they are anxious to deliver and get cash soon. But we can not take any chances.
We purchasers must not make any mistakes considering our production planning and
performance (10). 33

Clues given and clues desired for sensemaking may differ between the
parties, making clue display problematic. Attention, including clue display, and
construction of meaning may convene or not. Therefore trust development may
halt or even reverse. External actors' expressions concerning the personal traits
and characteristics seemed to be more common and important in the very
beginning of the interaction, i.e. clues for early sensemaking of trust.

6. 2. 2 Competence and Experience
Competence is an important feature for business ideas in both cases but in
different ways. Explosive is a high-tech operator in its niche, selling knowledge,
not goods. Plastics as a manufacturer seeks a competitive edge in product
development based on the entrepreneur's competence. It is not astonishing then
that competence was one dimension of person-based trustworthiness that the
external actors very much focused regarding both Explosive and Plastics.
Competence entails different clues for trust.
Explosive's early main customer (Gamma) was from the beginning so
convinced of the competence of Explosive, that no other external alternative was
discussed. The contact persons had a very accurate knowledge of the patents the
entrepreneurs had developed throughout the years. The customer also revealed
that if Explosive had not succeeded at the start, they would have offered the
entrepreneurs employment. This trust in Explosives' entrepreneurs formed the
basis for continued co-operation: "We were convinced that co-operation would
be successful" (12). That is in our frame of reference: Our shared meanings
makes it easy to form and create joint action.

33 This and following quotations of respondents' statements in interviews are translations from
Swedish.

<-----Page 104----->105

Plastics' entrepreneur looked particularly for customers with high
requirements for quality where the entrepreneur's competence would be
interesting. This would at the same time create a protected niche for Plastics in
competition and also enable wider price margins. Both interviewed customers
had the same ideas and very clearly expressed trust for Plastics' entrepreneur by
going into joint activities in product development. Plastics could, if its ideas
were considered to be fruitful for the customer, have considerable influence on
types of products and the pace of product development. The parties came near in
joint construction of meaning. One extreme situation was commented by Alpha
in this way:
I do not accept his [the entrepreneur's] ideas immediately, instead I need time to think it
over. The ideas were right, but I needed time to accept certain compromises about the
design, over which our final customer in France had opinions (11).

Plastics here, by its trustworthiness in the external actor's eyes, came very near to
assuming leadership in the product development downstream.
One of Plastics' financers, Almi, backed up the entrepreneur to a large
extent due to his solid technical background, which "is an important factor to
interest financers and others" (13). And Almi's finance manager contended that if
the entrepreneur and enterprise is trustworthy in their view, it would be so also
among customers. Financial back-up would facilitate potential customers'
decisions to rely on the new supplier. Almi in its advisory role towards
Explosive expressed trust in the entrepreneurs, whose strength was the combination of personal experiences and technical field of expertise. They had chosen
a niche just so narrow as to ensure that their competence created superiority.
Strategic positioning affects trustworthiness.

6. 2. 3 Managerial/Commercial Capacity
Technical competence and experience regarding the products need not
necessarily be matched by trust in the managerial and commercial ability and/or
capacity of the entrepreneurs. One of Plastics' customers, Beta, was not
convinced at the beginning but felt instead a need to observe for some time
whether the theoretically educated technical expert really could run a business
enterprise. Clues for trustworthiness had to emerge. The consultants in Almi
assess potential business starters. A person may be trustworthy in competence
and in ideas to exploit. Still, if s/he has handled financial matters, e.g. debts, ir-

<-----Page 105----->106

regularly in the past, the total trustworthiness will be low. Clues for trust can
certainly make negative sense for the other.
In what ways did the entrepreneurs display managerial or commercial
ability and capacity? Both entrepreneurs considered it necessary or desirable to
enter into close co-operation with customers for problem solving and product
development. They must display ability to work jointly with the customer in
accordance with the customer's procedures and traditions. It can also be
expressed as displaying different clues for the other's construction of meaning.
Trustworthiness lies in success of the projects in terms of quality, notably result
and timing. Alpha commented concerning Plastics' entrepreneur:
He informed us about the time schedule to develop necessary tools and equipment for the
new production. He managed in accordance with the time table. We were not used to
that. This was important, since we were dissatisfied with another supplier, and we had in
our turn given promises to our selling agents abroad (11).

Since then they have together developed other products. Trustworthiness is often
relative, depending on other actors and competitors. Trust can be a competitive
advantage.
One way to accomplish person-based trustworthiness in managerial/
commercial ability and capacity is to display understanding for the other actor's
problems. That is like saying: "I see your needs in meaning construction and
make that my own construction of meaning." The entrepreneur often meets
actors in large, established organisations, where many people are involved in
business transactions. Procedures are different. When many people are involved,
procedures may be difficult to change. There were situations where
entrepreneurs in both Explosive and Plastics had to consider the ways of
handling interaction and business transactions of their larger customers. The
entrepreneurs immediately understood this problem and did adapt their ways of
interaction, which the customers expressed as being positive for trust in the new
ventures. Alpha also expressed satisfaction with quick action from the
entrepreneur, since the entrepreneur did not have to inform so many others and
co-ordinate others' tasks in implementation.
Trust in managerial/commercial ability and capacity is central in personbased trustworthiness. An entrepreneur believed to be able to run a business must
assume commercial and managerial responsibilities. This is very important as a
prerequisite for growth and for being an employer. No wonder therefore that the
business start advisors connect trust to this dimension and look at the business
starter's whole personal capacity. The question about a specific entrepreneur:
Why do you consider him trustworthy? was answered by Almi as follows:

<-----Page 106----->107

Well, it is really the whole way of running the company. To be out visiting the customers
is important and to try to acquire new categories of customers. It is together with the
customers you will see new possibilities. Then bring it back to production. He has also a
large network with machine suppliers abroad. Sweden is too small. He invests in better
machinery before his competitors do, and he gets machines cheaply buying from
bankruptcy sales. He works with the organisation, arranges things so that it works also
when he is out travelling. He acts before acute problems show up (13).

6. 2. 4 Conclusions: Dialogue and Mutuality in
Person-based Trust
A purpose of using sensitising concepts in interpretations is to discover or
highlight new dimensions that will enrich the concept and make it more useful in
the future (cf. chapter 5). The three dimensions above of person-based
trustworthiness have now been discussed. What additional dimensions has the
analysis brought up? As an extension and partly rearranged outlook we will
discuss the importance of dialogue for person-based trustworthiness. Mutuality
as a stance behind the actors' interaction and its implications for trust is the
second extended dimension.

6. 2.4.1 Dialogue and Trust
A dialogue starts with each of the persons paying attention to the other. Each of
them seeks clues that make sense. They may then enter into further meaning
development and action. A clue for imposing meaning can be the impression on
the other that one makes. The other notices one's attitudes, modes of behaviour
etc. The entrepreneurs in the cases made contact using their old network and they
also tried to expand it by engaging new actors. Those interviewed who met
entrepreneurs of the new ventures for the first time reflected quite a lot about the
impressions they got of the entrepreneur on the first few occasions. In the
interviews we also discussed the external actors' experiences from meeting other
entrepreneurs than those in the cases.
The situation for the external actor is one of possibilities and risks. The
purchasing officer in Beta said: "Can I believe what he says? Can I rely on what
he says, that they will live up to it the way I need for a supplier?" (10). In
Weickian terms: Do I get clues for meaning construction? In chapter 1, this
situation has been explained in terms of equivocality (Gartner, Bird & Starr,
1992). The entrepreneur may express an equivocal situation as unequivocal for

<-----Page 107----->108

two reasons. One is that the external actor is expected to enact unequivocal
situations, the other may be the entrepreneur's self-deception. The entrepreneurs
in question also realised the dilemma for the external actor: the hazard in
premature trust. They used two ways to promote their own aims with the
discussion. One was an open attitude: As straightforwardly and candidly as
possible inform the external actor and give accurate answers to questions. The
expressions given in the interviews with the entrepreneurs of their endeavours
were matched by similar commentaries from the actors on how they perceived
the entrepreneurs. The open attitude displayed by the entrepreneur has then
continued in the relationships. An open attitude facilitates the others' attention
and meaning construction. Plastics' main supplier of raw material, Delta,
expressed it in this way:
Our discussions, normally three times a month, about the market and prices, his view of
what is going to happen, also gives a kind of picture of confidence. We are in a central
position of this development. What he tells, gives us signals that he perceives things in a
realistic way and that he is actively seeking information for his business (15).

Providing external capital to an existing enterprise can at least partly be
based on the history of the enterprise: sales figures, market share, financial data
from balance sheets etc. But history does not normally exist for the new venture.
There are few or no "hard figures" to assess as clues for trust. Judgement can be
partly be based on a business idea but as a credit officer in Almi said:
Everything falls back on the person. Trust must be conveyed through discussions, by
posing questions you let the person tell as much as possible. Raise questions that will
make the person open up in the discussion. Then the person must give accurate and sharp
answers on what he will do, how he will handle different situations. Formal
questionnaires, checklists and other templates give less than a straightforward dialogue
(13).

The initial dialogue and its continuation is very much contingent on the
discussing parties' general view on what they want to do and how to do business.
Alpha:
We soon noticed that we could discuss on a high level. We have the same background in
chemistry and we want a supplier to bring us new useful ideas. With him
[the entrepreneur] we can have a fruitful dialogue (11).

The entrepreneur expressed the same view in this way:
We want a new way of thinking among our customers: To see new areas for using our
products. And we look for such customers (8).

<-----Page 108----->109

The attitudes and ways of action seem to set the line for continued interaction.
Those actors who have long term relations to the entrepreneurs expressed similar
views, e.g. that they continue to work with the entrepreneurs because they speak
the same language, which was considered to be very important, particularly in
doing product research and development together.

<-----Page 109----->110

6.2.4.2 Mutuality and Trust
The views expressed concerning dialogue show a natural interest to promote
each actor's own aims but there is more to be identified. Beta said:
it is important that he [the entrepreneur] feels he can trust us, that they have a reliable
customer in us (10).

And another:
We are trustworthy, otherwise they would not continue to cooperage with us (11).

There is a view of mutuality in trustful dialogue. 34
But the dialogue in its turn seems to be instrumental to more depth in
trustful relations. There were also expressions for mutual trust in a more
personalised view. Explosive's entrepreneurs have, as mentioned above, decades
of relations with key actors within a large customer, Gamma, whose contact
person talked about a strong co-operation characterised by mutual trust and
respect for each other's work. Furthermore, the entrepreneurs had very clearly
acknowledged the customer's competence and vice versa. The contact person in
Gamma commented:
We know what each of us is good at and where we are weak. So then we can complement
each other. Together we have sometimes also had to look for competence from outside
our relations in order to reach what we both wanted (12).

Mutuality in personalised trust could be seen in different relations.
But there is still one step deeper where mutual trust can be seen as based
on ideology or values: Common views and ideas concerning the aims for doing
business, the role of the industry in society and responsibilities in a wider sense
than just the enterprises involved. The entrepreneurs in Explosive and Gamma
felt trust in each other because they shared the views on safety and
environmental protection in the industry handling dangerous and hazardous
processes and products (i.e. basic values and beliefs). Being very experienced in
handling the processes and products they could all of them rely on each other's
34

Cf. the discussion in chapter 4 concerning one-sided trust, i.e. trustworthiness, developing
into mutual trust.

<-----Page 110----->111

precautions not to cause accidents and maybe loss of life. This ideology was
accurately summarised by Gamma's contact person in this way:
Ideas and visions are important. To have an ideology. Environment, for my part. Not to
use things that could be dangerous for man and nature. Not to jeopardise people's health
for profit. I have experienced the same ideology in Explosive. We all want support for
our thoughts (12).

6. 3 Enterprise-based Trustworthiness
Enterprise-based trustworthiness is in the analysis expectations tied to the new
venture in the dimensions:
- trust in the new venture as an organisation, which is its
characteristics (not the entrepreneur's) and processes
within
the
venture or exchange processes between the new
venture
and
external actors
- trust in products, characteristics of products, product
development, quality of products and distribution
- trust in financial resources and stability.

6. 3. 1 Trust in the New Venture as an Organisation
For a business start-up and in its early development there is in the view of
external actors often no clear distinction between the entrepreneur as person and
the new venture (cf. section 1.2.1). Nevertheless, discussions on trust evoked
thoughts and arguments among external actors and entrepreneurs concerning
different issues: Is the new venture complementary to the external actor's own
enterprise? Is it something new or not in the market? What business risks are
involved when the external actor deals with new venture? How does the new
venture handle things compared to the external actors themselves?
To be complementary is to have something that the other party needs or
desires in order to reach its outcomes. Explosive possessed when it started a
specific patent around which it marketed and performed services, a very
noticeable clue. The new venture was complementary also in another way:
considered by actors to bring in new ideas, working with smooth-running
procedures and less bounded by traditions. Trustworthiness, manifested in
company assets based on competence, was important for the customer needing
the complementary services.

<-----Page 111----->112

Complementarity and novelty are phenomena close to one another. To be
new in the market and succeed can be based on bringing in something which did
not exist before - cf. Schumpeter's (1934) criteria for innovation in section 1.2.4.
Plastics' entrepreneur said on a number of occasions, that it is no use to start a
business with a "me too"-strategy, i.e. try to market something parallel to
existing enterprises. And this entrepreneur consciously attempted to bring
novelty to the market in terms of new product applicability and qualities that the
competitors could not or would not attain. Novelty was for the venture a way to
convey trustworthiness, to offer clues for trust. Still more so for Explosive:
Having in four years developed 14 patents and been awarded three times in
innovation contests functioned deliberately as a way to invite trust. Explosive's
entrepreneur:
These awards can be decisive for potential customers. The fact is that we have been
assessed by impartial people and been nominated to this rather advanced award. We see
that as trust between supplier and customer (9).

Trust can be an issue in deciding between alternative business partners.
Alpha had since a very long time, and before the start of Plastics, on-going
relations with another supplier. This quality-minded buyer regularly tested
quality of its supply and found in the last few years increasing quality
irregularities in delivery from its supplier. A visit on site showed ageing
production equipment (which the supplier had tried to camouflage). Discussions
did not help. Plastics happened to market itself at that moment, Alpha started to
buy from the new venture on a small scale. Plastics' products met the
requirements. As a consequence and after a period of slowly shifting between
these suppliers, Plastics is now replacing the old supplier. In other words: Wellestablished trust between parties in a relationship is not gained forever. It has to
be constantly reproduced. Trust and trustworthiness may dwindle. But to fulfill
business aims trustful parties are still needed. Relationships may change due to
the needs of trusted partners.
The discussion in the last section showed another issue connected to trust.
Alpha would not accept risks that a business relationship would not bring
accomplishment of its outcomes. There was a need to trust a partner, but trust did
not remain. Trust is important when there are risks. To reduce risks trust was
sought elsewhere. When a trustworthy partner emerged, trust developed and
risks were reduced in the customer's eyes. The need for trust goes hand in hand
with risk: An important relationship is a potentially risky relationship and trust
makes meaning in the relationship of reducing feared risk. Are there specific

<-----Page 112----->113

risks concerning new ventures and hence trust issues? All interviewed external
actors could see such issues. If it is difficult to assess trustworthiness, it is more
difficult to evaluate risks in involvement with the new partner (whether new in
the market or not). Risks in the relationship can concern promises and engagements: prices, qualities, quantities, timing, all of which may bring repercussions
to the external actor's own production, distribution etc. Different consequences
for the management were also mentioned when changes of plans had to be made.
But also explicit statements that some of these risks are not only connected to
new ventures but also to new relations with existing enterprises. A new venture
can be vulnerable in a number of ways: financially, in organisation of its production and distribution.
Due to risk assessment different criteria, rules-of-thumb, are needed in the
eyes of the external actors. There were a number of ways to perceive reduced or
controlled risk: One is trying to judge how important the customer or product is
for the new venture. A key product is one on which the new venture is very
dependent for survival and development. A key product can bring proportionally
high sales to the new venture and is therefore important for its cash-inflow. A
key product can also be important to create a niche or competitive edge for the
new venture. So the argument from one external actor, Beta, goes this way: The
new venture will do its utmost to succeed with a key product. Hence a noticeable
key product is positive for the new venture's trustworthiness. A parallel
argumentation came up concerning a key customer (or potential one). So
experienced purchasing officers tried to assess what key products and key
customers made sense for new venture. To be a key customer or buyer of a key
product is a clue for trust in the new venture.
Plastics explicitly tried to promote its trustworthiness by "records".
Records are references that a product or a relationship has worked in the past
between two actors. References are used by one actor to acquire trustworthiness
in the eyes of a third actor. Records as references will be further discussed in
chapter 8, here it needs only be said that the new venture can refer to a
relationship or ongoing transactions with one actor when it tries to promote
trustworthiness to another actor. If this new actor believes the reference to be
trustworthy, the trustworthiness for the new venture may be enhanced.
References are clues for trust. References are mentioned as being a standard
procedure in emerging contacts with new ventures, but only when there are
references considered to be relevant for the potential new actor's outcomes from
dealing with the new venture.
Before and during business start-up financers' and advisors' trust in the
total business concept is an issue. Apart from what was discussed regarding

<-----Page 113----->114

person-based trustworthiness above, trust to these actors has a wide meaning
covering almost all aspects of the start and early business: "Commercialising the
business idea", covers the possibilities in the market place, what is novel
compared to competitors, production and distribution facilities needed and
possible to obtain and how finances can be arranged. These issues will be further
covered later in this chapter. We concentrate here on what is important for trust
particularly in the start-up in relation to start-up financers and advisors. Many or
even most business ideas are in their very beginning vague, unspecified, often
unrealistic in terms of possible profitability. The market is often conceived too
wide or too narrow. The product may not be adapted to production in practice,
etc. That is to say: Clues for trust are lacking. Normally it takes a process of
dialogue and investigations in order to arrive at a practicable business solution.
Financers and start advisors do - apart from assessment of the entrepreneurs as
persons - evaluate adaptability in the business ideas: that ideas could be and were
actually changed when circumstances from market investigations etc. so
indicated. Trust is very much interpreted as flexibility in what arrangements
should be viable for the prospective new venture. Also Plastics' main supplier,
Delta, took some pains in deciding whether the new venture had a business
concept that would survive in the market and hence become an active and solid
buyer of raw materials. A supplier, well positioned in the industry, with a deep
knowledge of the industry's structure and way of functioning can both directly
and indirectly become an important "gate opener" or "gate closer" for the new
venture, depending upon how it assesses the new venture's possibilities.
Trustworthiness and trust is an issue. This supplier presented a similar situation
outside the cases:
Respondent: We have another customer, which started in the same period. Much more
capital was required for that venture. An established company went in with 10 % capital
and got a seat in the company board.
Researcher: Was that enough to increase trustworthiness?
R: Yes, definitely. Far more than the 10 % capital represented. A very competent person
at the board to give them advice. Had it not been for that solution, we would have
considered it very hard to give them help, considering the higher risks in this case due to
narrow price margins (15).

This combination of person-based and enterprise-based trustworthiness
immediately put the new venture on the recognised map of that industry, brought
trust to counter risks perceived.
Explosive developed, after a couple of years in business, a new idea. The
entrepreneurs immediately understood that it needed to be organised as a joint

<-----Page 114----->115

venture including authorities, technical consultants, financing bodies and
potential key customers. Since the idea was still very much in the core of
Explosive's competence and experience, the company saw itself as the "spider in
the web". But parts of the idea implied risky and temporary undertakings, other
parts expensive investments. It would not be possible to remain trustworthy if the
business's forms and joint venture organisation was not adapted to the specific
situation. So immediately, when the business ideas started to be discussed with
external actors, Explosive signalled its willingness to discuss how the joint
venture should be built up. Among other things this was a way to display
trustworthiness: We are prepared to do our utmost to make the joint venture
successful.

<-----Page 115----->116

6. 3. 2 Trust in Products
Trust and trustworthiness is seen in connection with the importance of the
product. In the preceding section the importance of the key product for
supplying new venture to counterbalance risk was identified. When the customer
of the new venture considered the product to be a key product for their own
operations it was subjected to more scrutiny, tests or small amounts in trial
orders. But, inversely, an experienced purchasing officer in Beta would also
assess whether the product was important for the new venture for
trustworthiness:
I would try to check how important the product is for them and based on that how I
would believe that things would turn out (10).

As could be expected, products from the new ventures were put to tests by
customers. Test procedures could be rather elaborated. First a "reference
product" - was required to be compared with existing or expected supply. If
positive, a second step would be to buy a small sample and use it in the
production process, as a component in what is sold to final customers. A blind
test was to use the sample in certain delivered lots but not others in order to see if
the final customers noted any change, complained or reacted in a positive way.
The next step would then be increased lots. When, finally, adequate
trustworthiness for the product was established, links to the new venture's
competitors might be weakened or broken. Somewhere in the process the
customer paid a visit to the new venture in order to assess production facilities,
production processes and maybe how distribution is organised. As Alpha put it:
"We want to see that they do not burn out antiquated machinery, that may
impede quality and jeopardise delivery to us" (11). Trust was in this way built
stepwise in interplay between attention, search for clues denoting trust and
assessment, i.e. meaning construction/reconstruction.
Of course not only new products were assessed. Regular delivery
reliability was important to the customers who often had made promises to
dealers and final customers in their turn. They risk their own trustworthiness
when they rely on the new venture. Their own trustworthiness is an important
meaning imposed for their relations with others. No wonder that reliable delivery
was mentioned (together with price and quality) as being one of the most
important aspects of trustworthiness in on-going transactions. Reliability
concerned both quality, quantity and timing. Delivered quantity and timing of
delivery was by Alpha once in a while tested by suddenly placing a larger order

<-----Page 116----->117

than usual to see what happened, i.e. if chaos broke out or not. Quality and
timing was assessed and registered upon arrivals of lots. Statistics were compiled
on quality deficiencies (by sample tests) and on timing of delivery. A sign of
trust was increasing long-term contracts and reliance on Explosive and Plastics
as main or sole supplier.
Belief that the new venture would continue product development was
important to the customers. This could furnish the customers with new ideas to
make use of in their markets. Alpha said:
We always look for new ideas for business, unconsciously. Stimulation. We want our
suppliers to bring that (11).

To be active in reconstructing meaning implies active attention and search for
clues. There were also signs of accelerating speed of development among
customers due to such ideas. Alpha and Gamma - one customer of each of the
new ventures - mentioned that some products came out commercialised earlier
than expected. Trustworthiness and development of trust was enhanced by that.
Entering into continued joint product development was facilitated. The financing
start-up advisor Almi also reckoned commercializable product ideas and ongoing product development as a basis in trustworthiness underlying funding
decisions.

6. 3. 3 Trust in Financial Resources and Stability
In the business start-up Plastics needed capital from external sources to build up
its production facilities etc. Trustworthiness was built very much on the
entrepreneur's capability and motivation, the business concept, products and the
competitive ability. On top of that came the financial requests. Two things were
important in the financing actors' view: 1) The total capital need compared to
what is normal for the industry, and 2) The financial leverage. Plastics could
count on a factory building with low rent. Rebuilding it was cheap, since friends
and family gave help, business friends sold material for low "friendship" prices.
The entrepreneur bought second-hand machinery. So the total investment was
favourable. He could personally raise funds making the relation between owner's
and borrowed capital favourable. Localisation in the countryside in an area with
unemployment made state loans on favourable conditions possible.
Trustworthiness could in these circumstances be raised both with Almi and the
bank.

<-----Page 117----->118

Essential for a new venture in manufacturing is credit with suppliers so
extended that capital tied to material in the production does not cause extensive
costs. This means negotiating for normal credit conditions on purchased material
and avoiding cash payment deals or special bank guarantees. Plastics was
scrutinised by Delta's (its main supplier's) finance department, since the new
company had no finance history to display in a normal credit investigation.
Clues, other than normally expected ones, had to be displayed by Plastics for
Delta's meaning construction. At the start Plastics therefore had to build
trustworthiness much more than had to be done once this "gate" was passed.
Explosive with its competence-oriented business ideas could argue the opposite
way:
When we started the business we had the aim not to build on loans and grants. Instead we
started with as little capital as possible, all of it was owner's capital. Then we wanted to
finance by retained earnings. But we were not against external funds for specific projects,
if it could be quickly repaid. We do not want to be dependent on the bank (1).

They have managed to live up to these expectations. But this obviously
favourable financial position has seemingly not been important for customers' or
other actors' trust in Explosive. Trust seems more to be based on factors
discussed above: the entrepreneurs' competence, successful product
development, a network suitable for expansion.
A standard procedure is credit investigation concerning the new venture
by using service bureaux specialised in the field. The actors seemed to consider
this as a routine measure taken by the company's finance department rather than
taken by those responsible for transactions, who in a couple of cases knew
nothing about what was reported. Credit investigation as clue for trust seemed
more or less to work as an alarm bell: You know nothing until it suddenly
sounds.
Additional fund raising became dramatic on certain occasions for Plastics.
Financial trust has required extensive personal acquisition of additional owner's
capital, otherwise Plastics would not have been entrusted loans from Almi and
the bank. Trust within the local community, i.e. among business friends of his
and his father's earlier company, have entrusted him with extended debt
repayment when necessary. But Plastics' entrepreneur had to fight for capital
from the bank several times, when investments in additional machines and new
products were planned. Trustworthiness has been at stake. In all he used five
ways for maintaining trustworthiness: 1) an open attitude to show circumstances
as they are, 2) a continuous dialogue with the local bank, 3) a use of balancing
parties for support and other external capital providers for reducing risk, 4)

<-----Page 118----->119

financial commitments by the entrepreneur himself and, finally, 5) showing
reliability in earlier commitments: "We have paid our interest on loans even if
the bank had tough prices on their money." (4) The use of balancing parts for
support and capital provision included suppliers. The main supplier agreed on
prolongation of payment for bills, confident that the new venture would do its
utmost to pay, all in the belief that its liquidity problems were temporary.
Relations so far had built up trust to meet the situation in an air of mutual regard.
The supplier, Delta, commented:
We accepted later payment against interest, since we knew what customers he had and
that they would not stop doing business with Plastics. At the end of the line there was a
good demand for the products in that range of certification (15).

So, financial trustworthiness was connected to a wider scope of assessment, a
complex set of clues for sensemaking.
Plastics has taken part in product development co-ordinated with
customers having specific requirements. Plastics' competitors have in similar
circumstances demanded that their customers with the specific requirements
should finance the product development. These competitors claimed that there is
no other buyer to sell to. Plastics instead offered to share development costs with
the customer. Looking for new business opportunities the entrepreneur saw it the
other way round: As an opportunity to get half the development costs for a new
product paid externally and still be free to market the result wherever possible!
This attitude was commented by Alpha:
We want a partner who is eager to develop new ideas. Next time we can use the spin-off
from his ideas (11).

Trust resides in realising and meeting the customers interests and needs, i.e. to
understand what makes sense for the other and construct meanings in
accordance.

6. 3. 4 Conclusions: Trust and Market, Trust and
Equity
6.3.4.1 Trust and Market
Among the actors around the two ventures it is possible to distinguish between
two opposite connections of trust and market. Some actors see the market,

<-----Page 119----->120

notably the industry where they are actors, as stable, not at all or very slowly
changing its structure. Still, the studied industry is based on chemistry with many
new product possibilities. These actors saw trust as not to disturb the industry's
main structure and functioning. New ventures' entrance was seen as something
positive, but at the same time the entrants should not rearrange industry
conditions in a more radical way. Trust was to enter and stick to the rules. The
respondent in Delta said that if the company wanted to expand, he would prefer
expansion involving existing actors rather than entrants. On the other hand the
same actor was positive in doing business with the study's new venture once it
was in the market.
The opposite connection between trust and market could be represented by
Alpha, who actually chose the new venture on the grounds that it brought
something new to the industry, namely novel products that would expand the
market as a whole. Trust here was seen to be efficient in bringing changes to
bear, and to challenge the established views of the products' roles and
functioning. Trust implied here that the new venture actually worked as a motor
for the customer's product development.
Trust is sensemaking based on the truster's view of ideals, i.a. their notion
of the ideal market. The notion of an ideal market reflects basic ideas and beliefs
about business in the industry, which for referred actors had a strong impact on
their meaning construction and how they paid attention to the new venture. The
entrepreneur must count on different grounds for equivocality in connection with
the market since the actors: customers, suppliers and competitors construct
meaning differently (cf. section 1.2.2).

6.3.4.2 Trust and Equity
Developing mutuality in trust could be seen on a number of occasions taking the
form of fair dealing in opportunities or costs. Above, concerning Explosive and
Gamma, we have seen mutuality in positive outcomes, such as benefit from spinoff products. Increasing costs were sometimes shared as a sign of trust. Plastics
met during a short time sharply increasing prices in raw materials. It could not
swallow the whole increase itself and feared negative consequences passing all
price increase over to its customers. So in open discussions with key customers
Plastics negotiated and reached agreements on splitting the loss between the
parties. The parties considered trust in the relationship to be important enough
not to take one-sided advantage of the situation.
Mutuality comes here close to equity (cf. section 4.3.1). Plastics splitting a
loss between the parties is an example of a situation that could have been settled

<-----Page 120----->121

in negotiation based on power, a solution that would probably have brought
detrimental effects to at least one of the actors involved. Instead the parties
sought a solution where the costs, imposed from outside, would be shared by all
actors involved. To suggest and to reach a solution based on equity the parties
must rely on each other, i.e. believe that everybody will fulfill her/his part of the
agreement. Also the deal between one of the ventures and a customer about
shared product development costs has an element of equity in it, particularly fair
rate of exchange between utilitarian costs and benefits expected.
Norms of equity and trust (mutual trust) go hand in hand. Equity is a set
of meanings and underscored by interpretive schemes. If that set of meanings is
shared between the actors, they will pay attention to each other accordingly.
Clues displayed signal meanings, ascribed as shared by the other actor and
including mutual trust. Common action based on trust ensues.

<-----Page 121----->122

6. 4 Institution-based Trustworthiness
Institution-based trustworthiness is expectations about an entrepreneur or new
venture tied to formal mechanisms which can provide trust. Formal mechanisms
are based on the dimensions appearing in the analysed data:
- laws and norms in society or a sub-society
- general values, beliefs and moral order
- traditions.
Laws and norms are highly standardised and written. They are imposed
generally but are often not very personally comprehended. Still they are used for
guidance. A sub-society can be an industry, region, or other social setting.
General values are values commonly upheld in a social setting. They are often
more personally comprehended than laws and norms. Beliefs are personal. Moral
order is values considered in a social setting to be obligations, even if they are
not formalised as laws or written rules. "Businessmanship", can be an example of
such a notion, i.e. a businessman is expected by other businessmen to be or act in
certain ways. An offer or an agreement from a businessman is in the setting
given certain meanings. Moral order is the obligation to share these meanings as
a basis for offers or agreements if you belong to the setting. Traditions as a base
for trust concern use of trust in the past for assessing trust in contemporary or
future situations.
Trust in the entrepreneur and/or the new venture resides in adherence to
institutional mechanisms as these are seen by the context or a wider
environment. These can be seen in the same way by the entrepreneur or in the
new venture but they may also be seen differently or not at all. It is the external
actor's sensemaking which is the basis for institution-based trustworthiness. In a
specific situation an external actor may see both institution-based trustworthiness
and another dimension: The entrepreneur may be seen both as personally
competent (i.e. person-based trustworthiness) and anxious to adhere to contract
norms in the industry (institution-based trustworthiness) at the same time. Still,
the distinction can be interesting for analytic purposes.

6. 4. 1 Laws and Norms in Society or a Sub-society

<-----Page 122----->123

Both new ventures were by external actors enacted regarding how they adhere to
laws as well as norms in the industry. Legal aspects pertain to different
comments on
- responsibility taken according to Swedish business laws
- financial legally sanctioned obligations concerning short-term
and long-term debts.
The legal form of the business venture can signal trust. In both new
ventures the entrepreneurs in the start-up chose the legal form of company
limited, even if that requires formal reports, more developed auditing etc., than
alternative Swedish forms (partnership or proprietorship). Explicitly, the
entrepreneur in Plastics explained that he did so because it seems more serious in
contact with large customers and suppliers. They get more confidence in the new
venture when financial control is more elaborated. And the entrepreneur picked
out an audit bureau which was expensive but had a nation-wide reputation. He
wanted to show that the company was backed up by the best financial
competence possible. Both entrepreneurs stressed in the discussion about start-up
how important it was to show to actors the symbols of an established company,
such as taxation number, bank accounts, postal giro number etc. Trustworthiness
seemed for them very much connected to the symbols that convey trust. The
symbols were thought to work as clues for trust. Common to the examples given
is that the entrepreneur (trustee) assumes that the displayed facts work as
meaning (trust) for the external actors (trusters). These meanings are assumed to
be held by the actors in a pre-determined way as interpretive schemes. They are
assumed to facilitate the external actors' sensemaking of trust for the new
venture.
Norms in industry concern i.a. agreements between the parties. One of
Explosive's customers, Delta, considered it very important with a thoroughly
worked-out agreement including not only co-operation between parties and
financial settlements, but also rights and obligations to patents, product use,
secrecy etc. They felt trust in that they shared the same view in making an
agreement covering as much as possible of these matters. One external actor
explicitly stated that they required industry norms to be the basis for agreements
with new entrants - "the floor", but also that these standards should be "the
ceiling": In a market with free and open competition no extra requirements
should be put on the entrants. Upon norms made sense as general, the actor
constructed meaning based on personal beliefs about the functioning of the
market.
So far this discussion regards adherence to laws and norms. Adherence is
a rather passive stance, that is just do what you must do. But the actors also

<-----Page 123----->124

enacted a more active way for the new ventures. They were to a large extent
proactive making use of laws and norms, even taking advantage of changes of
norms. Plastics' financer:
The entrepreneur acted in a unique way compared to more traditional competitors. He
quickly saw to it that he got important product certificates when the state increased
requirements in environmental laws. This was actually part of his business idea (13).

Both Plastics and Explosive explicitly considered acquisition of certificates to be
a business idea, to secure market niches and to ward off less qualified
competitors:
We sell a certified product to a key customer. Our main competitor is still trying to get
his certificate. Meanwhile we develop a related product for certification. In this way we
create a niche for ourselves by cutting the competitive situation and creating difficult
thresholds for competitors (4).

The customer in question (Alpha) expressed it in this way:
Plastics was not one of our regular suppliers at the time. But the product was certified, so
we started to buy from them on a small scale (11).

To be active in promoting business by norms is to attract attention, display clues
on meanings, similar to those imposed by the norms and expect that other actors
have or will create similar meanings. The role of norms is to standardise
expectations and meanings within a social setting.
Technical characteristics covered by norms, such as acid and heat
resistance were checked by scrutinising certification documents. The functioning
of the product was tested. Particular attention was paid to how the product
behaves in the actor's own production line together with other components and
whether it suited production and handling downstream, towards final customers.
This procedure and documentation functions as stored interpretive schemes to
promote business outcomes. In an example mentioned above, one of Plastics'
customers had changed to Plastics as supplier when the norms and requirements
were not reached by the former supplier, a competitor of Plastics.
Also the storage and handling during production in Explosive and
Plastics and the work processes are subjected to norms. The adherence to
different norms is regularly checked by the certification agencies in accordance
with the rules and requirements in the institutional context. Explosive had
acquired two different production and handling certificates from public

<-----Page 124----->125

authorities in the field. Inspections were regular and Explosive used the safety
argument to promote its trustworthiness:
The certificates give us orders. But we know that certificates are based on trust and we
must show the certification agency that we are worthy of trust by keeping good order in
what we do (1).

Both the entrepreneurs and external actors considered the inspections as well as
information exchange inherent in the inspection procedures to be important for
trustworthiness. Explosive also tended to see contacts between formal
inspections as some kind of insurance against mistakes or possible mishaps in its
operations, which could be negative for its reputation. To maintain reputation it
is worth paying some costs in time, as some kind of insurance fee. This could
also be expressed as an attempt to continuously reconstruct meaning for the company relevant for and in accordance with the institutional requirements.
Also many actors in the commercial context used inspection on the
premises as a means to judge the standards of the business partner (prospective
or in on-going relationship). Inspection concerns production and production
facilities, production processes and control as well as distribution processes.
Actors with established quality audits could make inspections of the supplying
new venture also on a regular basis. Plastics felt a pressure from a buyer who
used the ISO 9000 quality standard to meet the standard, but saw at the same
time more fundamental issues for trustworthiness in the short run. Another of its
customers using the same standard considered it to be more important that its
supplier worked with successive quality improvements over time.
Trustworthiness lay in the assurance that progress is part of the new venture's
endeavours, be it quality standards or other measures. To construct and
reconstruct meaning together with external actors was an issue, but a broader one
than just norms.

6. 4. 2 General Values, Beliefs and Moral Order
When two parties work together with product research and development it is very
important that you have the same background and understand each other. Even what is
not said. If your views are not the same, the co-operation will not be fruitful. You must
work for the same aims (12).

As a general view, represented by the quotation above, the Gamma project leader
considered the entrepreneurs' attitudes in Explosive towards safety and
environmental issues to be important in the industry. She also paid attention to

<-----Page 125----->126

this attitude showing itself in handling experimental and other development
work.35 Entrepreneurship and business start-up are in themselves phenomena to
which values are ascribed in society and sub-societies. Values concerning
business start-up were expressed by external actors and how these values could
affect action towards entrepreneurs and new ventures.
I considered it to be very strong to dare to start on their own after so many years in
Incubator. To take the risks. Positive factor (12).

This was expressed in part of a discussion on how the key actor in Gamma
judged entering into business with the new venture. General values concerning
business start-up influenced action in the specific situation. The purchasing
officer in Alpha:
Start-ups may have fresh eyes, looking at things in new ways. May come with new ideas
and are not laden with traditions. They have a slimmed organisation, making it easier to
handle co-operation, contacts go directly to the person who can fix what is needed. You
can use that to stir around in the pot a little, both in your company and the industry (11).

General values regarding the role of start-ups in the development of an industry
can affect trustworthiness for a specific entrepreneur exposing this set of values.
Action with this new venture takes on meaning. But there was also the opposite:
Expressions of hesitation, implying the importance of sticking to traditional ways
in the industry (cf. section 6.3.4 about the discussion on trust and market), and
attention concerning the entrepreneur focused on congruent clues, such as
adherence to the traditional delivery terms.
Among both entrepreneurs and the external actors there is a common
belief that there is a virtue for the entrepreneur to have a short way between
perception and action. The entrepreneur should grasp a situation and quickly
respond to it by action. For example the purchasing officer in Alpha:
I very quickly noticed that we could go into a direct dialogue, here and now. Not
necessary to send a lot of fax messages back and forth. Here we have a person who can
walk directly to his machines and adjust what is necessary (11).

For short this belief can be called "quick action". Enactment of this belief is
firmly based in the entrepreneur's context and it seems to be taken more or less
for granted in discussions. There was no difference in this belief between the
entrepreneurs and interviewed external actors. "Quick action" was often enacted
35

Cf. the discussion on mutuality and trust in the section on person-based trustworthiness
above in this chapter.

<-----Page 126----->127

by the actors concerning themselves and other actors. As a predominant social
construction in the context the belief probably influences how the entrepreneurs
want to see themselves and want others to look upon them. They want to act in
accordance with the common belief, since such action would be rewarded: It
facilitates reaching desired outcomes.
Researcher: Why do you have so large a stock of raw material?
Respondent: Must have. Today when we get an order we must deliver on the same day.
They may call at noon, and at 7 pm the truck is outside here. So we must have in stock
what we think customers may order (4).
------Respondent: Now I try to make the customers order 2 - 4 weeks in advance, but I fear the
competitors may cut in.
Researcher: In this way every company in the industry has very little influence?
Respondent: Yes.
Researcher: Strong norms develop?
Respondent: Yes, this is a function of spoilt salesmen who promise too much. And their
career hungry bosses who believe everything they read in business magazines (8).

An important implication is that the enactment of a belief such as "quick action"
easily becomes self-reinforcing. If among two actors both enact "quick action" to
be a virtue they will influence each other. This means that "quick action" will
become important for trust-building and use of trust. It will ultimately influence
the scope and directions of trust in industries. Quick action as a belief concerning
the entrepreneur will be value-laden and underlie trust.

6. 4. 3 Traditions
Tradition is an inherited or established way of thinking, feeling or doing
(Merriam-Webster Thesaurus, 1991, p. 619). Traditions play an important role in
the development of the two ventures, in the thinking of the entrepreneurs as well
as external actors. In the case description above (section 5.5) and earlier in this
chapter there are quotations and discussions where tradition is evident. To
summarise and conclude:
Explosive's three entrepreneurs have considerable industry background in
a large well-known company, from which the entrepreneurs could use earlier
performance and network for sensemaking. The main customer at the beginning
knew two of the entrepreneurs from doing business with Incubator, one of them
had actually worked with a project for that customer 30 years ago, another one

<-----Page 127----->128

had once been a teacher for the customer's contact person. One of Explosive's
entrepreneurs stated:
"We [the entrepreneurs] had as a common denominator that we had worked an immense
number of years with this kind of development work in Incubator. [...] We had learnt in
Incubator how to do the job and we continued in that way when we started." (1).

Traditions guided their professional work and also the assessment of the main
customer in their business start. Tradition in this sense includes stored
interpretive schemes by using earlier established work procedures, as
exemplified in the quotation.
The entrepreneur in Plastics also has a large research, production and
marketing experience in his industry. Furthermore, there are industrialist
traditions in his family and he is well anchored in local society. The family
tradition was well-known among Plastics' earliest customers, who knew or knew
of the entrepreneur's father and his father's company. The entrepreneur himself
was by some actors immediately connected to the father's company, since the
prospective entrepreneur had worked there. Beta saw Plastics as a direct continuation with some years in between. The entrepreneur himself expressed the
importance of trust from the family industrialist tradition in a situation with
temporary financial problems:
Suppliers gave me extra credit, they knew me through my father. He had a good
reputation and they assumed I was brought up in the same spirit (4).

The market director of his main supplier Delta formulated himself in a similar
way and added:
we had reason to assume that he would adopt his father's way of running the business
(15).

Institution-based trustworthiness in the form of tradition could be
important at the start. Trust as meaning is connected to tradition, which can be a
way to reduce equivocality by an already determined meaning construction. As
discussed in section 1.2, unequivocality makes sense for existing enterprises. The
new venture will therefore try to express itself as unequivocal. This is where
tradition may come into the play.
Traditions as an inherited or established way of thinking, feeling or doing
also must have a start some time and be formed and shaped due to events after
the start. New ventures in interaction with external actors embark upon tradition
formation, apart from what is inherited. Signs of tradition formation can be seen
in both the new ventures. Norms concerning product delivery and payment

<-----Page 128----->129

procedures were early built in a specific way in some relations and they tend to
continue without question over time once they are established. Reliance on each
other may promote the emergence of institution-based trustworthiness. An
example could be that Explosive nowadays gets orders on some rather complex
development work in a rather simplified way, almost as automatic orders. The
entrepreneurs' comment:
The customer does not make any effort to more clearly specify and delimit the orders
over time. I think they rely more and more on us and our specific competence. It is
difficult to buy in this specialised technical field (9).

We can see here signs of person- and enterprise-based trustworthiness, but also
the building of institution-based trustworthiness, i.e. an established way of doing
business that takes its model from what has functioned earlier, in the immediate
past, as stored interpretive schemes.

6. 5 Conclusion
In this chapter we used the three concepts concerning bases of trustworthiness:
person-based, enterprise-based and institution-based trustworthiness, denoting
the general types of clues for actors' attention concerning another actor. The
bases of trust were all believed to cover complex meanings and be rich in variety
at the time of forming the study's frame of reference. Dimensions of contents
within the trust bases were partly set as a frame of reference built in section 4.4,
partly they successively grew by interpretation out of the analysed data with
meaning expansion and enrichment as relevant purpose (Miles & Huberman,
1994; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). How an originally more narrow concept became
expanded in meaning can be illustrated by the following example: Enterprisebased trustworthiness was first given two main meanings, based on literature at
hand. Trust in products delivered and in the venture's financial resources
available were the preliminary content given. By confrontation of this sensitising
concept with interview data a prominent widening was the indication that trust
could reside in a trustee which was complementary, i.e. had or developed
something that the truster needs or desires. Also, it was pointed out, that if the
trustee has something new in the market, can bring novelty, this is a similar
cause for trust. Therefore, a new dimension of enterprise-based trustworthiness
was introduced, pertaining to the new venture as an organisation, its general
capabilities. An example of enrichment of the notion of trust in products

<-----Page 129----->130

delivered is the following. Not only quality, quantity and timing is conducive to
trust but also trusters' assessment of how strategically important delivery seemed
to be for the new venture (trustee) itself, i.e. conditions around a delivery
mattered for the truster to trust the trustee.
External actors were in the analyses labelled trust raters, when the role of
external actor to assess trust is in focus.36 Trust rating means that a truster pays
attention to, and seeks clues from meaning. Furthermore, the truster creates
meaning about a trustee by attention, basic values and beliefs, and interpretive
schemes. Also non-actors (with no direct contact with the new venture) in the
general environment, e.g. mass media, were found to be trust raters.
Some general conclusions can also be made concerning the situations
studied concerning trust. Trust can be a precondition for action to occur. The
entrepreneurs first considered whether trust should be justified and then enacted
trust. Entrepreneur's and/or external actor's construction of trust as meaning
elicits action or affects the way action will ensue. Trust raters assessed personal
characteristics, competence and capacity of the entrepreneur (person-based trustworthiness) meaningful for action. Enterprise-based trustworthiness often rested
on agreements, orders and capital provision decisions etc. Adherence to norms
such as certification was a necessity in many instances (institution-based
trustworthiness).
Trust can also be a result of action performed. Due to action, trust
emerges or is changed in the eyes of entrepreneur and/or external actor. By
interaction their sensemaking of trust is affected. Trust in the entrepreneur as
person could change due to sensemade performance in interaction. Enterprisebased trustworthiness could e.g. emerge by small trial orders or product tests. We
have also discussed examples of common values and norms developing during
interaction.

36

It is an analogy to the notion of rating, assessment of a company's financial status.

Chapter 7

Trust Development in Action Processes
7. 1 The Notions of Use and Build Trust
One of the main study issues presented in chapter 1 is: How do entrepreneurs
and external actors use and build trust in action processes? The purpose of this
chapter is to analyse how trust made sense in action processes. First, there is a
need to clarify how concepts are used. Some emanate from the theory presented
in preceding chapters, such as action process, sensemaking, trustworthiness and
the trust bases. Other concepts were induced from the data during the analysis, as
tools for description and understanding: use trustworthiness, build
trustworthiness and pre-trust are such concepts.

7. 1. 1 Trust Before and After an Action Process
One of the conclusions in the last chapter (see section 6.5) was that trust can be a
precondition for action to occur. The entrepreneurs in the cases first considered
whether trust should be justified and then enacted trust. An actor's construction
of trust as meaning elicits action or affects the way action will be taken. Trust as
meaning concerns the actor's own trust for the other actor, for example whether
the entrepreneur trusts a customer. For action to occur it also an issue whether
the entrepreneur is trusted in the eyes of the external actor. Trustworthiness as
precondition for an action process to occur includes for each actor a double
sensemaking: A sensemaking B and A sensemaking whether B trusts A. Any
two-actor relationship thus includes four sensemakings. If more actors are
involved, sensemaking becomes highly complex.
Trust can, as has been said in section 6.5, also be a meaning formed by
action performed, a result of action. Due to action trust emerges or is changed in
the eyes of entrepreneur and/or external actor. By interaction their sensemaking
of trust is affected. Each actor's double sensemaking (of the other and of self in
the other's eyes) comes in here too.

<-----Page 131----->132

From an analytical point of view there is a difference between trust as a
precondition to action and trust as result of action. As a precondition trust is
given ex ante. It is made sense outside of the studied action process, e.g. by
earlier action between the parties. As a result trust is made sense by the action,
but the action process may not be the only reason to trust ex post. Trust as a
result of action is a consequence of the interaction between the focal actor and
another actor, but can also be influenced by information about the parties coming
from outside the interaction and by other interactions.

7. 1. 2 Use and Build Trustworthiness
In action processes the entrepreneur can use trustworthiness, considered by the
entrepreneur to exist in the eyes of an external actor as a precondition to an
action process (cf. section 4.4). Trustworthiness could in its turn be affected or
not by the unfolding of the action process. Trustworthiness can as a result be
unchanged, increased or diminished.
In action processes the entrepreneur can intentionally build
trustworthiness, if existing trustworthiness as a precondition to the action
process is considered by the entrepreneur to be inadequate in the eyes of an
external actor for use in an action process (cf. section 4.4). Trustworthiness can
as a result be unchanged, increased or diminished.
When trust makes sense for the entrepreneur's desired outcome it is a
reason to use or build trustworthiness. Typical outcomes in business start-up and
early development are to become an established business, acquire external
funding or a new customer, get increased sales from a sales campaign, etc. But
such a business outcome can be difficult to reach and may require preparation in
the form of extensive trust-building in order to first develop trust between the
parties. Developed trust will then facilitate reaching a desired business outcome.
So trust-building can make sense not only for business outcomes but also for the
relationship between the parties. Meaning and action processes vary as to what
extent they are predominately business or relationship oriented, and whether acts
are characterised by use of trustworthiness, building of trustworthiness or a blend
thereof.

7. 2 Trust Development in Six
Relationships

<-----Page 132----->133

The study has analysed the two cases, Explosive and Plastics, as well as external
actors dealing with the new ventures, to see: 1) whether the entrepreneurs and
external actors attempted to make use of trustworthiness for the entrepreneur in
action processes in order to reach a desired outcome, and 2) whether the
entrepreneurs attempted in action processes to build trustworthiness in a
relationship with the actor in order to promote achievement of outcome.
The stated two points indicate a concentration to study the sensemaking
concerning the entrepreneur as focal actor (cf. the discussion in section 7.1.1
concerning complexity of the sensemaking situation).
Trust as a precondition for action to occur will for shortness be called pretrust. Pre-trust can be defined as trust considered by an actor to exist in the eyes
of another actor before an action process starts. If not otherwise stated pre-trust
will refer to the focal actor, the entrepreneur.
The presentation below contains central action processes with one focal
actor (entrepreneur) and one external actor in six different relationships. The
selection of relationships is based on the following considerations (compare also
section 5.3.3):
- Relationships between the entrepreneur as focal actor and different external
actors (customer, supplier, financer and advisor) will give an over-all view of
trust development as seen by the focal actor and at the same time a variety in
data
- Bilateral relationship between the entrepreneur and external actor in order to
distinguish more clearly the truster and the trustee
- As few relationships as possible to enable depth in analysis without an
overwhelming amount of data.
For each relation will be

- described the action processes over time
- discussed outcomes of the action process
- characterised the main pre-trust situation in the new
venture start, whether trust existed and could be used or had to
be built
- indicated trustworthiness used and/or built in action
processes

<-----Page 133----->134

- discussed trustworthiness as result of interaction
- indicated some implications for mutual trust.
An action process is in this study defined as one or several interacts enacted by
an actor to reach an outcome (cf. section 3.1). What an action process is, where it
starts and stops compared to different events, how action is grouped into a
specific process is due to actor's sensemaking of outcome. In this analysis,
however, action processes studied are demarcated by the longitudinal study
period (cf. section 5.3.3). It embraces the time from the start of the new venture
up to the stop of data collection for the study. So trust as result of interaction is
here linked to the stop of data collection and not to any specific event or outcome
in the processes. Since the purpose of this instrumental case study (see section
5.2.2) is not the study of trust in any specific outcome, but instead concept
building, the important thing for the analysis is that a number of action processes
have occurred during the study period. Trust as result of interaction is "up to
now", where "now" is the third round of interviews with the focal actors (cf.
section 5.3.3).
The presentation and discussion will in each relationship be built on
documentation and interview data from both the entrepreneur and the external
actor. The six relationships are the following:

7. 2. 1 Plastics - Alpha
7.2.1.1 Action Processes over Time
Customer Alpha's traditional main supplier of plastic containers for its products
more and more failed to reach quality standard in deliveries in the beginning of
the 1990's. Furthermore, the supplier did not manage to improve quality despite
complaints. Alpha was in this situation open for new solutions to its supply
situation. At that moment the entrepreneur in Plastics, well aware of Alpha's
quality requirements but not of its supply problems, started marketing to Alpha.
The entrepreneur and Plastics were at the time (1991) totally unknown in Alpha.
The entrepreneur's competence and ideas as well as the products matched the
requirements of Alpha's managing director. Product samples were tested and
found adequate, test lots were ordered and blind tests were performed with
Alpha's customers. All passed without adverse remarks. So Alpha successively
increased purchases from Plastics and diminished ordering from its old supplier.
For the original type of container, there is now an annually running agreement of
delivery. Alpha considers Plastics to be a stable supplier in quantity, quality and
time.
Alpha's managing director also wanted to develop new types of containers
for its products. That is also where Plastics' product ideas and competence fitted
into the picture. The dialogue between the entrepreneur and Alpha's managing
director resulted in a couple of new types of containers developed by Plastics,
where development costs were shared between the companies. This successful

<-----Page 135----->136

co-operation has then encouraged further joint development of existing and new
containers. Ideas and initiatives in this dialogue come from both parties.

7.2.1.2 Outcomes of Action Processes
For Plastics marketing to Alpha meant getting a stable customer in an industry
where legally enforced quality standards were strict. Plastics knew that its
product certificates matched Alpha's requirements and that few of its competitors
had the same certificates. Plastics' competence could then easily be noticed in
marketing and the venture's position in the niche was strengthened. For Plastics,
new product development together with Alpha also meant increasing its product
range with high-quality products for which there was a demand in the market.
Sales of these products could possibly be extended to new or existing customers.
Sharing development costs with Alpha facilitated for the new venture to
financially engage itself in this investment.
For Alpha, Plastics meant a more reliable supplier of containers. Alpha
runs risks if its customers - or environmental protection authorities - become
dissatisfied with the packing of delivered lots. For Alpha Plastics also meant a
co-operative partner bringing new competence in plastic containers to support
Alpha's own product development.

7.2.1.3 Pre-trust
Since Plastics and its entrepreneur were unknown to Alpha no trustworthiness
existed before the first contacts between the entrepreneur and Alpha's managing
director. The latter commented:
Our contacts in the container market had been very few. We exclusively stick to those
who have a good reputation. You do not enter into this business without references (11).

For Alpha pre-trust seemed important. And at the same time Alpha did not
consider Plastics references - at the time - important, since Plastics' customers,
then mainly in food processing and paint production, have far less strict quality
requirements in terms of necessary certificates. So Plastics could not use
trustworthiness to enter into this business. Trustworthiness had to be built.

7.2.1.4 How Trustworthiness was used and built in Action

The first meeting with the entrepreneur and subsequent telephone contacts were
commented on by the managing director in Alpha in this way:
He gave a very competent impression. He knows chemistry. Being a chemist myself, I
immediately felt that we can understand each other. [...] He gave accurate answers to my
questions. [...] A serious person (11).

So the entrepreneur could build person-based trustworthiness at the start of the
relationship. Then there were the tests of Plastics' products with no adverse
results. Trustworthiness for products was built, i.e. enterprise-based
trustworthiness. Alpha could here also compare the results with its former
supplier's. But what about entering into business with a completely new venture?
Alpha was not afraid of that, partly because of Plastics' competence, partly since
Alpha did not buy larger volumes than could have been bought from other
sources. When Plastics' delivery capacity and timing was proven, Alpha bought
more from Plastics. That is: a trade-off between trustworthiness and risk. At that
time trustworthiness for the entrepreneur (person-based trustworthiness) and
Plastics (enterprise-based trustworthiness) could be used - no tight schedule
enforced by Alpha. Finally, Alpha put itself a little more in the hands of Plastics,
going into product development that was important for Alpha itself. Alpha's
managing director:
He informed us of the time table. And he stuck to it. We are not used to that. Important
for us, since we must give reliable information to our distributors in 30 countries (11).

7.2.1.5 Trust as Result of Interaction
Starting with no trustworthiness, person-based and enterprise-based
trustworthiness have been built throughout the three years of business relations.
One example of Plastics' trustworthiness in the eyes of Alpha at the beginning of
1995 is the statement of Alpha's managing director:
During the development of the new products he saw our problems and could come up
with a suitable concept. I do not accept his ideas without question, but I need time for
thinking. His ideas were right, but I needed time to accept some compromises in design. I
had to check with one distributor how the final customer would consider the change. But
the ideas worked (11).

To accept, put efforts and costs in ideas coming from an external partner displays
very developed trustworthiness for the external partner.

<-----Page 137----->138

7.2.1.6 Implications for Mutual Trust
Building of trustworthiness for the entrepreneur and new venture has in this
relation been very effective throughout the three years. Regarding the
trustworthiness of Alpha in the eyes of the entrepreneur in Plastics there are three
indicators: Firstly, in an intimate dialogue between a supplier (Plastics) and a
customer (Alpha) concerning products based on the supplier's specific ideas,
competence and market information, the supplier runs the risk that the customer
will use the information for agreements with competitors. If the supplier suspects
that, restrictions on information will enter into the dialogue. In this case Plastics
has acted with free and open communication. Secondly, Plastics has used Alpha
as a reference in its marketing. Thirdly, if a supplier suspects that the customer is
unreliable in payment, then restrictions, such as shorter or no credit, bank
guarantee etc., will be claimed. No such thing has happened.
Particularly considering the free and open discussions and joint financing
of product development, trustworthiness seems to be reciprocal. Mutual trust has
developed during the period.

entrepreneur went into action considering he had trustworthiness. Build trust means that
the entrepreneur had a prominent wish to increase trust by entering into the action, i.e.
trust-building was intended. It is indicated whether use or build was predominant in the
entrepreneur's sensemaking.

7. 2. 2 Plastics - Beta
7.2.2.1 Action Processes over Time
Beta was a customer of Plastics' entrepreneur's father's company, from which
they bought containers. When that company ceased to exist Beta bought from
elsewhere. Then in 1991, shortly after Plastics' start the entrepreneur began
marketing the Plastics business ideas together with the former salesman of his
father's company. The entrepreneur was unknown but the salesman was very
well-known within Beta. The purchasing officers of Beta considered Plastics to
be a continuation of the father's company and started to buy the same kind of
container as earlier (with some functional improvements). First they bought a
small quantity for a test, which was successful. There are international
certification requirements for transport and handling of the containers, which
Beta adheres to, but not as strict as the Swedish requirements for hazardous
products. The quantity purchased of this product has then increased. Deliveries
are agreed on annually in a contract. Beta may in the future also start buying
containers of different sizes, but no decisions have been made yet. The
relationship between Plastics and Beta is up to the beginning of 1995
characterised by on-going planned purchase of one specific product.

<-----Page 139----->140

7.2.2.2 Outcomes of Action Processes
For Plastics, marketing to Beta meant getting a stable customer buying regularly
in bulk. Such customers are important for positive cash flow and constant use of
production facilities. Since Beta has a central position in its industry it is also
important for Plastics to have Beta as a reference in its marketing to new
customers.
For Beta, Plastics is important as a stable supplier. Timing of deliveries
and quality is important since the containers go immediately into the production
process, and delays are expensive in terms of Beta's own deliveries. But Plastics
accounts for less than 1 % of Beta's total purchase volume of packing, and can
easily be replaced.

7.2.2.3 Pre-trust
Trustworthiness existed at the start of the relation in two ways. First, the
entrepreneur's father was a highly regarded businessman in the industry, which
was indicated in the researcher's discussion with the purchasing officer in Beta:
Researcher: Did you feel more confident in Plastics because you used to buy from its
forerunner?
Respondent: Maybe subconsciously. It is possible things were not alien in that way. Even
if it was not the same person I believe it affects you. We knew he was the son of the old
company's owner (10).

The second way trustworthiness existed was through the well-known
salesman in the former company, who now came to represent Plastics. He
formed the bridge between the old and new, as the purchasing officer put it. But
on the other hand the entrepreneur in person was unknown to Beta. In all, pretrust existed as person-based trustworthiness. To some extent the attitudes
concerning the entrepreneur's father reflected values on business morals, i.e.
there was also institution-based pre-trustworthiness.

7.2.2.4 How Trustworthiness was used and built in Action
Processes
Plastics made use of trustworthiness of the former well-known salesman in the
first contacts. But soon the entrepreneur took over the interaction. By that time

<-----Page 140----->141

product tests were performed, building trustworthiness for the new venture. Beta
also made a credit investigation of its new supplier. Enterprise-based
trustworthiness was built. The entrepreneur has in regular sales both used and
actively built person-based trustworthiness in the eyes of Beta. He is in Beta
considered to be a competent professional and a serious businessman. Since he
also knows how important timing and accuracy in delivery is for Beta, he has
displayed more than ordinary interest in checking that delivery is according to
the customer's wishes. Beta as a large professional buyer has standardised
computer-based procedures for arrival control, invoice handling etc. Plastics has
taken pains in arrangements to meet the large and established customer's requirements in that respect, i.e. used and built trust very much by displaying
understanding of its customer's needs (enterprise-based trustworthiness).

7.2.2.5 Trust as Result of Interaction
After four years Plastics is trustworthy in the eyes of Beta primarily because
promises of quality and timing of deliveries have always been fulfilled. Since
Beta is ISO-certified this has been documented in systematised follow-ups. Beta
now also considers Plastics a possible future partner for new sizes and types of
containers. It is also possible that shifts will occur from other suppliers to
Plastics for some products. Trustworthiness is here very much due to the new
venture's adaptiveness to the large, established customer, in many ways different
from Plastics itself. This adaptiveness also means that Plastics is trusted for
adherence to the norms set by Beta, i.e. it still has institution-based
trustworthiness. In all, trust as result of interaction is both person-based,
enterprise-based and institution-based.

<-----Page 141----->142

7.2.2.6 Implications for Mutual Trust
Use and building of trustworthiness for the entrepreneur and new venture has in
this relation been very effective throughout the four years. The trustworthiness of
Beta in the eyes of the entrepreneur in Plastics can be demonstrated by two
indicators: First, Plastics has used Beta as a reference in its marketing. Second, if
a supplier suspects the customer to be unreliable in payment, then restrictions,
such as shorter or no credit, bank guarantee etc., will be claimed. No such thing
has happened.
There is a situation of certain dominance and submissiveness, conceived
by both parties. Plastics takes very great pains in complying with the customer's
needs. In one situation the researcher could even see that the entrepreneur overinterpreted some delivery requirements from Beta. Beta, on the other hand,
measures its supplier completely out of its own perspective, giving very little
room for mutual adaptation.
If mutual trust can exist in situations characterised by some dominance
and submissiveness it can be ascribed to the smooth and well-working
relationship between the parties. If mutual trust, on the other hand, is
incompatible with dominance creating an unsafe situation for one of the parties,
there are in this case restrictions to mutual trust.

<-----Page 142----->143

7.2.3.1 Action Processes over Time
Customer Gamma had in the beginning of the 1990's all the competence for
development of a new product, but the timetable for development was tight, and
the company decided to hire expertise on a consultant basis from outside for joint
product development. Explosive was contacted by the project leader in Gamma.
This occurred shortly after Explosive's start. This contact was not preceded by
any marketing activities from Explosive. The three engineers in Explosive were
well known in Gamma since the 1950's, when one of them developed a patented
product for Gamma. No other firm was contacted, since the project staff in
Gamma were convinced that Explosive was the right choice.
A one-year agreement on co-operation was settled in December 1991. The
agreement consisted of a thorough description of the job, clauses concerning
finance, secrecy, rights to developed patents and products. A close co-operation
ensued. The basic view of Gamma was to have a fully-fledged co-operating
partner with as wide an interest and role in the project as possible and not to hire
a consultant performing delineated parts of the work. Ideas were discussed
jointly as was planning of work. Job performance depended on what a person or
a group of people could take responsibility for on each occasion. Evaluation of
the job was done together. The first agreement was completed within the time
limit, which was all around considered to be a very good performance. New
annual agreements of the same type followed, concerning variants of the product.
Co-operation continued along the same line.

7.2.3.2 Outcomes of Action Processes
For Gamma, Explosive meant both extra resources and acquisition of new
competence, together enabling the company to keep the timetable for product
development. For Gamma, co-operation with Explosive also meant bringing in to
the company another kind of experience within pyrotechnics. Explosive
functioned as a stimulator for new ideas and as a means for concentration on the
main development task, warding off side issues so common within a large
company. Finally Explosive helped to convince more conservative people within
Gamma of the benefits of newer technology. Through the co-operation Gamma
has also become a supplier to Explosive's development project together with
another of Explosive's customers. That is to say: Gamma and Explosive are now
both suppliers and customers for each other.

<-----Page 143----->144

For Explosive, the project meant a stable customer in Explosive's main
line of competence: contribution to constant project occupation, positive cash
flow etc. Due to the co-operation and ideas of reciprocal benefit from the work
which was manifested by the agreements, the project has also given Explosive
new products and patents to market to other customers. This development could
not have been carried out solely in Explosive's own laboratory.

7.2.3.3 Pre-trust
Explosive's entrepreneurs' trustworthiness in the eyes of Gamma was very high
right from the start. Person-based trustworthiness existed concerning the
competence of all three engineers (entrepreneurs) due to long-term earlier
professional contacts and co-operation. A conviction that these persons were the
right ones for the job existed on several levels within Gamma. Gamma took on a
risk that the venture might fail, but confidence in the persons was strong:
Researcher: What would have happened if the venture had failed?
Respondent: We could have offered them jobs in Gamma (12).

So even though there was at the moment no basis for enterprise-based
trustworthiness, person-based trustworthiness was strong and compensated for
lack of possibilities to show enterprise performance for enterprise-based
trustworthiness.

7.2.3.4 How Trust was used and built in Action Processes
From a start of using person-based pre-trust, further person-based
trustworthiness and enterprise-based trustworthiness was built by successful cooperation and outcomes in accordance with timetables and agreements. Both
Gamma's project leader:
Explosive's trustworthiness became stronger over time. What I had hoped for came true.
We knew they had a different situation in Incubator than we had, but they showed that
they really understood that. You must think in other ways here. And so they did (12).

The entrepreneurs of Explosive displayed engagement in Gamma's problems and
in their needs for outcomes to be attained. Person-based and enterprise-based
trustworthiness was used in renewal of contracts. Over time, co-operation
became deeper through shared ideas concerning the co-operation, i.e. institutionbased trustworthiness. Gamma:

<-----Page 144----->145

We speak the same language and that has become more evident throughout the three
years of co-operation. Thoughts about safety, the respect for explosives, product
development is based not only on facts and figures, sometimes it is more art than science.
Fingerspitzgefühl (12).

Trust was also built in shared values concerning the products' and industry's role
in society as a whole (institution-based trust). The contact person again:
Ideas and visions are important. Environmental matters for example. Not to use things
dangerous for man and nature. Not to jeopardise people's health for profit. I have
experienced the same ideals in Explosive (12).

So we can see institution-based trust-building on different levels at the same
time. First, in the work itself. Second, concerning ideas about co-operation.
Third, regarding values and norms of this work in general. In sum, the joint
project work for Explosive functioned as an important means for building
person-based trust concerning performance in the work and enterprise-based
trust as a platform for new agreements, which then could be used for new
contracting. Successful project work then gave chances for more trust-building.
A virtuous circle appears.

<-----Page 145----->146

7.2.3.5 Trust as Result of Interaction
Now after three years of active co-operation Explosive is trustworthy in the eyes
of the Gamma project, based both on pre-trust and trust-building. Gamma's
project leader:
You can not get a better co-operation than this, because in the resulting patent we
contributed with one chemical compound each. This says something of how we worked.
If one party had disappeared the other could not have done it. Both were necessary for
the result (12).

It seems here that trustworthiness is at a maximum for any co-operation,
covering both person-based, enterprise-based and institution-based trust. In a
wider sense they have also reached views on shared responsibilities versus
external parties to the relation. They agree on joint effort to make the endproduct users assume responsibilities to more actively prevent accidents, for
example. When trust emerges during the process, it becomes natural to
cooperage even in matters outside the immediate relationship.

7.2.3.6 Implications for Mutual Trust
Actually, as may be noticed in the quotations above, mutual trust pervades very
much of the process. Explosive entered immediately into a very demanding
agreement and would have hesitated about the scope of obligations accepted in a
near-start situation if Gamma's trustworthiness were not high in their eyes. In the
joint co-operation Explosive disclosed competence that could have been misused
by Gamma if Gamma were not trusted by them. It would have been difficult for
Explosive to impose legal sanctions if Gamma had broken the rules and spirit of
the agreement. Conversely, also Explosive could have misused its knowledge of
business secrets in Gamma. Neither of them seriously contemplated such risks.
The action processes are very much based on mutual trust. According to
Gamma's project leader:
We have confidence in each other and respect each other's work - that is what I have
experienced (12).

They acknowledge each other's competence. They also discuss openly
weaknesses in competence and ability and seek actively to complement
deficiencies, inside the relationship or using resources from outside. Only in

<-----Page 146----->147

mutual trust can both parties acknowledge weaknesses to each other. Some
orders from Gamma to Explosive are given at short notice and in small portions.
Over time it seems that Gamma gives less and less guidelines and restrictions to
their job orders. Explosive, on the other hand, accepts this, which for a
consultant could be a risky undertaking, if the parties do not have confidence in
one another.

7. 2. 4 Plastics - Delta
7.2.4.1 Action Processes over Time
The father of the entrepreneur in Plastics bought raw material in bulk from the
supplier Delta for his company since the end of the 1970's. The entrepreneur at
the start of Plastics contacted the former salesman in Delta. The salesman and the
entrepreneur knew each other well. Plastics wanted to buy from Delta on normal
business payment terms, one month credit, since Plastics intended to use the
same terms towards its customers. Delta understood that a formal credit
investigation would not give very much information about the recently started
Plastics. Therefore not only the sales department but also the finance department
became engaged in assessment of Plastics' trustworthiness as a debtor. They
visited Plastics for an investigation and discussion on the spot: Plastics' sales
prospects and subsequent supply needs, how financial possibilities looked in
general etc. The discussion was very open-hearted. Delta's assessment covered

<-----Page 147----->148

the trustworthiness in the following respects: 1) The entrepreneur's capabilities
as a producer and businessman (person-based trustworthiness), and 2) The new
venture's financial prospects, primarily for stable future payment for deliveries
(enterprise-based trustworthiness). Delta got a positive picture of the
entrepreneur from answers to posed questions. The salesman also to an extent
recognised business views and morals from the entrepreneur's father (institutionbased trustworthiness). From their general knowledge of the industry they also
judged the range of products and types of customers to be favourable for Plastics
for the future. They came to the conclusion that Plastics could be given normal
credit terms, i.e. no bank guarantee or other intermediate buffer was needed.
Order, delivery and payment has ensued in a normal way. But on two
occasions Plastics ran into payment problems. From the beginning there were
two partners in Plastics. One of them left the new venture after a short time,
withdrawing capital, which the remaining entrepreneur had to raise. This took
some time and strained the liquidity of Plastics. The entrepreneur called Delta's
sales manager and informed him about the situation. He was given some days'
respite. The debt was paid. The sales manager considered the entrepreneur's
action positive, since not all of their customers would have taken pains to contact
and explain but would instead just have tried to let it pass. On a second occasion
Plastics ran into payment problems, mainly due to the fact that Plastics'
customers had run into similar problems in their turn. There was a short but
marked recession in the Swedish economy at the time (1992). Again, the entrepreneur called Delta's sales manager, explained the situation, asked for a time
respite and offered interest on a rather high level, used in delay situations. The
manager accepted for two reasons: 1) he now relied on the entrepreneur to do his
utmost to keep promises, and 2) he knew the market where Plastics customers
were and he was convinced that the market would expand despite the situation
for the moment. Payment was then fulfilled in accordance with the agreement.

7.2.4.2 Outcomes of Action Processes
For Delta, Plastics is a small customer, representing only a few percent of its
total sales in Scandinavia. Financially, Plastics brings some sales income which
is not very important for Delta. But in the specific niche: sales of raw material to
be used for blow moulding of high-quality containers, Plastics represents 20 %
of their market. And Delta considers it to be important to stay in that niche.
Therefore Plastics is important strategically more than in sales volume and Delta
regards the business relation as valuable.

<-----Page 148----->149

For Plastics, it is vital to have a stable supplier on a world supply market
that changes rather quickly due to forceful actors and price fluctuations. Apart
from supply per se, price and market information and personalised contacts for
agreement are vital for Plastics to maintain. Plastics also uses other suppliers, but
they work more locally, and can give less business information back in
discussions.

7.2.4.3 Pre-trust
Pre-trust existed for the entrepreneur in the eyes of the former contact persons
between Delta and the company of the entrepreneurs' father. The entrepreneur
was known in person. They also assumed that he would act in the same way as
did his father. Delta's sales manager:
We entered into this because we had the picture of the entrepreneur and his background,
his father and our business with him. Undeniably, this has facilitated contacts between
Plastics and Delta (15).

Pre-trust was person-based with some undertone of morals, institution-based
trustworthiness:
Researcher: What did you know about his ability as an entrepreneur?
Respondent: First of all we knew he had the experience from his father's business, who
was a skillful entrepreneur, who started with his empty hands. The son was opposite,
academic background and comes in another way. Still, we had reason to think that he had
his father's way of running the business (15).

7.2.4.4 How Trust was used and built in Action Processes
The entrepreneur was successful in building trust in the first discussion.
According to Delta's sales manager:
The impression he made on me and my colleague was positive. He could speak for
himself in a way that impressed us of plans he had for the future (15).

But pre-trust was not sufficient to enter into ordinary credit terms with the new
venture. Trust had to be built. Now the entrepreneur's personal ability had to be
displayed: Knowledge of product and market and how financial stability could
be reached for the new venture. Both person-based and enterprise-based
trustworthiness had to be built. In following regular purchases person-based
trustworthiness and enterprise-based trustworthiness could be used. Successful

<-----Page 149----->150

continued supply and payment relations have ensued with contacts 3-4 times a
month about price development, future deliveries, etc. Trust-building seems to
continue as this part of the interview with Delta's sales manager indicates:
Researcher: What is most important for the entrepreneur's and the new venture's
trustworthiness?
Respondent: Our recurrent discussions about the market, his view of what is going to
happen, gives also a sort of picture of trustworthiness. We know most of what there is to
know about price development. Positive to hear that he has a clear picture and keeps
himself informed. Raw material is an important part of the product's price, which an
entrepreneur must realise, otherwise he may get into trouble (15).

The entrepreneur builds trust by displaying knowledge of important business
factors in the eyes of the other party. He also by displays eagerness for more
information and shows the other party that the information is used for the
business. The entrepreneur could later on use trustworthiness in two trustdemanding situations with disturbances. First, the problems were not caused by
the entrepreneur or the new venture. Second, there were credible solutions at
hand, not detrimental for the supplier. Third, the entrepreneur displayed openness and candidness. But the basis for the supplier's support must be belief in the
entrepreneur's handling of earlier similar situations (building of person-based
trustworthiness) otherwise the supplier would have required supplementary
guarantees.

7.2.4.5 Trust as Result of Interaction
Trust as result of interaction can be exemplified by the last quotation of the
preceding section. The sales manager of Delta seems confident that Plastics will
also manage its business in the future. He also recognises the entrepreneur's
competence:
When there are problems in the production, where raw material is or when the producer
is believed to be a cause for the trouble, then we often have to give help. But that has
never been necessary for Plastics, the entrepreneur's background in polyethylenes
accounts for more stable production (15).

Fewer problems to be feared in future interaction seems to be positive for trust.
In all, Delta displays institution-based, person-based and enterprise-based
trustworthiness for the new venture at the end of the interaction.

7.2.4.6 Implications for Mutual Trust

<-----Page 150----->151

The open discussions between the parties where they disclose market
information etc. indicate that some mutual trust exists. Information exchange
seems to cover more than a minimum for this supplier - buyer relation. The
parties seem to experience more gains than risks by openness.
There can also be discerned a slight unbalance in the situation. Delta seemingly
considers itself to have more vital information than its counterpart, a possible
source for dominance. This could be a way to bind the customer harder to its
supplier. On the other hand, Plastics has more sources of information, so the
venture need not become dominated by this contact.

7. 2. 5 Plastics - Almi
7.2.5.1 Action Processes over Time
As a part of preparations before the start of Plastics the entrepreneur contacted
Almi in the county to tell them about his plans. His aim was general support and,
more specifically, financial support. No one at Almi had up to that point had any
contact with the entrepreneur (nor his father in his previous business). But they
knew who the entrepreneur was from indirect sources. After the entrepreneur's
first presentation the consultants considered him to be a person with a very good
technical education, relevant industry experience, and a person with no financial
problems (unpaid debts etc.) in his background. He presented his business ideas
in an interesting and accurate way.
In the next step, after an agreement on support, Almi conducted a market
investigation. They noticed that this initiative could become one of few
polyethylene manufacturers in Sweden to comply with new and more strict
norms concerning transport of hazardous products. They learnt from contacts
with industry experts that the production would need specific qualities of raw
material and strictly monitored dispersion of raw material into the production
process. This required adequate competence. The market for this kind of

<-----Page 152----->153

products could be expected to grow. Their conclusion was: Had the
establishment been a new company of the kind that is already typical for the
market - to compete on the same grounds as others - they would not have
supported the new venture. But this encompassed something new: Products that
fitted into the new requirements, which had been manifested by certifications.
Financially, they knew that the entrepreneur was prepared to raise owner's
capital. Then he had a bank contact. Finally some capital on the top was needed.
The bank declared itself prepared to provide capital if Almi did the same. Almi
for its part considered the business idea good enough according to the market
investigation (see above). The proportion of borrowed capital could be held
comparatively low, partly because of owner's capital, partly because of the low
cost level (low rent for a factory in the countryside and second-hand machinery).
Location in an area with unemployment qualified for state localisation loans on
favourable conditions, provided that local employment would be promoted. Almi
made a positive decision and so did the bank. Almi has later supported Plastics
with temporary loans on a few occasions. Firstly, when the entrepreneur's partner
left and his owner's capital had to be replaced and when Plastics widened its
product range by acquisition of another machine and another building. Secondly,
Almi has also performed the role of a regular discussion partner in monthly
meetings with the entrepreneur concerning Plastics' business development.

7.2.5.2 Outcomes of Action Processes
For Plastics, co-operation with Almi has meant a necessary contribution to
funding its business at the start and expansion. These loans have been more
important than the amounts themselves, since the bank has conditioned their
loans on the investigations and decisions of Almi. In this way Almi therefore has
functioned as a financial gate-opener. Apart from financial matters, the
knowledge that Almi built up concerning Plastics' industry, together with Almi's
general business consulting experience, has provided Plastics with a discussion
partner for its other strategic business decisions. The interaction continues also
when no funding needs are impending.
Almi has a very specific role. It is as a semi-public organisation in matters
of start-up funding, and a more typically market oriented role in general business
consultancy. In the market for business consultancy Almi needs customers that
show success in business and where this success at least to some extent can be
attributed to Almi's support. Plastics is such an example.

7.2.5.3 Pre-trust

<-----Page 153----->154

Plastics' entrepreneur had no pre-trust in the eyes of Almi's consultants, apart
from reputation, which was not in itself adequate for commitments.

7.2.5.4 How Trust was used and built in Action Processes
The entrepreneur's presentation of his business idea clearly built trust. Trustbuilding was person-based trustworthiness.
Researcher: Which is most important, the person or the idea?
Respondent: The person, no doubt. In this case, he could give a very good account of
how blow moulding should be performed. Then the person must have a view of potential
customers, market, competitors. But if someone shows up and can not give sharp answers
to our questions, that is a signal of warning. It all falls back on the person. In the
conversation we build a view of how the person functions, if he or she is prepared to take
responsibility, how earlier situations have been managed - and that the person has a
driving force to act (13).

Plastics' entrepreneur passed the scrutiny. The next step was to build enterprisebased trustworthiness, which was done by the investigation of market and
product. Then came the financial discussions and the funding decisions. Earlier
built person-based trustworthiness could be used, and then the entrepreneur
showed commitments both by assuming own financial risk and pursuing a credit
proposal with the bank, i.e. he built person-based trustworthiness. The
enterprise-based trustworthiness from the investigation was used to make
trustworthy calculations for the venture's operations based on accurate
knowledge of materials, production and work organisation. After the start, Almi
follows how Plastics performs in its regular operations. Its good performance
builds trustworthiness, both in terms of person-based and enterprise-based
trustworthiness:
Researcher: Plastics' trustworthiness in your eyes after the start period?
Respondent: Still very high. Can be measured in financial terms: Growth, turnover,
profitability, all is positive. Increased turnover by 1,5-3 million Sw. kronor each year,
takes market share, enters successively into profitable areas. New designs, new
containers, interesting for customers. And we have an open communication between him
and us (13).

Additional financial needs are often met with doubt or suspicion after fundraising in the start, i.e. whether the venture has a future or will become a "leaking
seave". Business plans and calculations need fundamental support of
trustworthiness. Plastics passed the test and got temporary credit when it was

<-----Page 154----->155

important to settle temporary problems or to take advantage of expansion
opportunities. It could use its person-based and enterprise-based trustworthiness.

7.2.5.5 Trust as Result of Interaction
Trust as result of interaction for Plastics was described by the consultant in Almi
as many ways of doing things combined:
The way of running the business. To be out visiting the customers and listen to their
needs and in that way see new possibilities. Looking for new customers actively. To
renew production facilities before problems arise. Develop the work organisation and
give responsibility to the staff (13).

These things are visible for the consultants as a result of the interaction. They
display person-based and enterprise-based trustworthiness.

7.2.5.6 Implications for Mutual Trust
Plastics' entrepreneur displays trustworthiness for Almi:
They have been very important for us to have reached where we are now. [...] We have
also had them as a balancing part, when the bank was reluctant to give us extended credit
(4).

But Plastics' trust for Almi is wider than merely as a financing part. That
is clear from their interaction in strategic development matters for Plastics. Since
Almi is no actor on the same market as Plastics the company does not need to
feel any risk of business plans leaking to competitors. This can facilitate
confidence.
In terms of a balanced or unbalanced situation of dominance and
submissiveness in the relationship Plastics has no doubt been dependent on
Almi's assessments, decisions and gate opening role versus the bank. But Plastics
may in the future more rely on retained earnings for investment (cf. section
5.5.2), which would automatically reduce risk of dominance. On the other hand,
for Almi, Plastics represents one role model for its activities: Almi recommends
others to contact Plastics for study visits, newspaper articles etc., which is good
marketing not only for Plastics but for Almi as well. Almi needs this kind of role
model to show how it co-operates with its customers. A high degree of mutual
trust seems to have developed between the parties due to openness in their
discussions and reciprocal benefits from interaction.

7. 2. 6 Explosive - Almi
7.2.6.1 Action Processes over Time
Explosive's financial strategy is to develop and grow mainly by retained earnings
and not to be dependent on external financers (see also section 5.5.2). So
Explosive had no reason to look for partners bringing capital to its business,
although specific projects have been temporarily funded by external capital. But
from the very start and onwards Explosive has been looking for business advice
and organisations for joint development of its business, i.e. organisations which
can complement its own competence and network.
Through a business development project conducted by the municipality,
Explosive made contact with Almi. The entrepreneurs were at this point of time
not known by the Almi consultants. They paid a visit to the venture in 1992.
Explosive presented its business ideas and activities so far. Both Explosive and
Almi found it interesting to keep in touch for the future. In this case no funding
for investment was needed, so the main purpose for continued contacts was
exchange of thoughts and ideas. Almi considered the products and product ideas
in Explosive to have a high technical level and at the same time good market

<-----Page 156----->157

prospects. Some short information activities followed during the following
months.
One of Almi's business support activities is to select interesting products
and companies for prize nominations in product contests and similar reward
activities. So, based on suggestions from local business, Explosive was
nominated to "Alfred Nobel's Skapa-stipendium", a nation-wide product contest.
Almi's assessment was in accordance with regulations for this prize: technical
level, novelty and market prospects. Explosive was nominated as number one in
the county and ended up with an honorary diploma in the nation-wide contest.
Explosive has since then been nominated for two more products, ended up as
number one in the county and participated in the national contest. These three
contests with regional awards each time have been followed by a number of
articles and interviews in local newspapers as well as in industry journals.
Explosive has taken the initiative to develop recycling processes and start
recycling some of its earlier developed products. It is a large project which must
encompass large manufacturing companies in the industry, regulating and
licensing agencies, and risk capital financers. The project organisation is open
and characterised by a lot of meetings. Being and feeling small in this group of
large and powerful actors Explosive needs support for its ideas and solutions.
Almi is one of its supporting bodies.

<-----Page 157----->158

7.2.6.2 Outcomes of Action Processes
For Explosive the contacts with Almi have meant assessment from outside by
experienced consultants, whether its business ideas will bring commercializable
products and whether they are novel. Also it has brought feed-back that the
enterprise is well-run. For Explosive, Almi is also a partner which through its
network can enhance good-will to Explosive and its competence for product
development. This good-will is particularly high-lighted by the nominations to
product contests.
Explosive is not one of Almi's most intimate customers, but Almi also has
the role of promoting business in its region. To forward Explosive is for Almi a
good example of how regional promotional activities can be run.

7.2.6.3 Pre-trust
Explosive and its three entrepreneurs were not known by Almi's consultant so no
pre-trust existed before interaction started.

7.2.6.4 How Trust was used and built in Action Processes
The consultants in Almi immediately got interested at the first meeting:
Their presentation was on such a level that we immediately got interested. The high
technical level of it makes it interesting. Also the persons, the background, the way of
presenting it all (13).

The consultants themselves have a technical background, so they could estimate
the competence along with the presentation of the extrapreneur-story behind
Explosive. Person-based and enterprise-based trustworthiness was built
immediately. Trust was then the platform for further, but not very intensive,
contacts. There was no agreement that Almi should take part in market research,
finance investigation or other business matters. But Almi had insight into the
product development and assessed products. In the words of Almi's consultant:
They had very good competence within their narrow market niche. Another solution than
electronics to compete with. Electronics is more vulnerable than pyrotechnics. And their
products are always close to commercialisation. No point in developing products nobody
wants to buy (13).

<-----Page 158----->159

So further person-based and enterprise-based trustworthiness was built for
Explosive, which was used in the nominations to the product awards. (However,
it should be pointed out that these were not based only on assessment from
Almi.)

7.2.6.5 Trust as Result of Interaction
Trust for Explosive after three years is in a way summarised by one of the
consultants:
Explosive's entrepreneurs are active 'doers' - all the time managing actors around
themselves. And somehow they make things and people move in the direction Explosive
wants them to. It is a combination of will-power, open communication and to think one
step ahead of others (13).

The last two quotations clearly indicate person-based and enterprise-based
trustworthiness of Almi for Explosive as a result of the interaction. Almi's
support to Explosive's product development contacts and the award nominations
are further indications. Concerning the awards, does trust built in action process
make trust even more easy to build further in later stages of an action process?
Does one success make next success more easy to accomplish? That is to ask:
Does trust built by the first award make the next award easier to get? Is trustbuilding like a snowball that automatically increases in size once it has started
rolling? What is the implication of built trust and reputation? Has trust from
earlier awards made it easier to win two more contests in sequence or is it
possible to disregard the past in a moment of assessment? Questions are more
easily posed than answers given. However, chapter 8 will discuss a phenomenon
which in this study is called "trust spill-over", meaning situations where trust
connected to one person or situation automatically will become connected with
other persons or situations. It will particularly treat implications of i.a. these
awards for reputation and trust outside interaction between the two parties.

7.2.6.6 Implications for Mutual Trust
The relationship does not contain decisive commitments from any of the parties.
No one would lose anything by breaking the contact. There is no dependence.
But both gain from the interaction. Even experienced consultants in Almi seem
to learn things from Explosive's actions. This attitude, and its resulting events
such as the nominations, is closely connected to trust. Explosive has expressed
trust for Almi by disclosing secrets in the products before they got protected by

<-----Page 159----->160

patents. Explosive has on a number of occasions sought trust with "objective"
partners such as Almi before difficult negotiations with demanding and powerful
customers. Trust is here a way of compensating for lack of resources or power.

7. 3 Conclusions Concerning Trust Development in
the Action Processes
Some conclusions concerning trust development in referred action processes
above can be made:
1) Trust can be built even if there is no pre-trust at the start, as was indicated in
Plastics' relations to Alpha and Almi as well as the relations between Explosive
and Almi.
2) Institution-based trustworthiness was important either as pre-trust, i.e. the
background of Plastics, or as norms and values developed during the action
process (Explosive - Gamma).
3) At the start person-based trustworthiness developed early by personal
presentations in marketing etc. Plastics' relations to Alpha and Almi as well as
the relations between Explosive and Almi had these characteristics. In the three
other relations person-based pre-trust for the new venture existed.

<-----Page 160----->161

4) Enterprise-based trustworthiness was developed after person-based (and
possibly institution-based) trustworthiness. This occurred in all relations except
Explosive - Almi.
These conclusions can be depicted as trust development patterns:37
Person-based trust -------> Enterprise-based trust.
Person-based trust concerning personal qualities and competence can be the
sensemaking basis on which enterprise-based trust may develop.
Institution-based trust and Person-based trust ---> Enterprise- based trust.
Trust based on norms, morals or tradition together with person-based trust can be
the basis for development of trust concerning product quality, delivery timing or
correct payment etc.
Person-based trust and Enterprise-based trust ---> Institution- based trust
Person-based trust and enterprise-based may be the trust platform for rewarding
interaction between the parties. Together the parties may develop values and
norms concerning products, the industry, business in general or society. These
common values and norms will become an additional basis for trust, institutionbased trust.
Furthermore, some conclusions can be induced from the data concerning
how trustworthiness is used and built. In the processes there is often an
alternation between use trustworthiness and build trustworthiness from one
action/event to the next in sequence. Either that concerns the same trust base, for
example build person-based trustworthiness to use it in next action, or a shift:
use person-based trustworthiness to build enterprise-based trustworthiness. And
as we contended in section 7.1.2, meaning and action processes may vary as to
what extent they are predominately business or relationship oriented. In business
oriented meaning the actor uses trustworthiness to promote outcome; if a
relationship needs to be strengthened there is an element of building
37

Induced patterns composed of chronological events in sequences can pose a challenge to the
researcher concerning relationship between the events. Yin (1989, p. 119) identifies four
possible relationships: 1) some events must occur before other events; reverse sequence being
impossible 2) one event must be followed by other events; a contingency basis 3) some events
can only follow other events after a prespecified passage of time, or 4) certain time periods in a
case study may be marked by classes of events that differ substantially from those of other time
periods. At present it is not possible to state relationship in these patterns due to the small
amount of data for induction. The patterns should be regarded as propositional - a challenge for
increased knowledge to be gained by more similar studies.

<-----Page 161----->162

trustworthiness. There are in the studied action processes some situations
characterised by the actor using trustworthiness for a business outcome and at
the same time aspiring to further build trustworthiness. It would be interesting to
discern whether the blend of meaning regarding use and build trustworthiness
varied in different situations, particularly if there as any pattern of blend during
the process. Such a study would, however, require a longer study period and
more data than provided in this study.

7. 4 Social Construction of Trust
In our presentation and discussion of trust as sensemaking we have so far
focused one actor's sensemaking of trust concerning another (cf. chapter 4). In
the discussed examples above we have met situations where two actors'
sensemaking has an impact on the unfolding of action processes. Reciprocality is
a matter in which sensemaking trust also implies that meaning and action of the
actors influence one another. To discuss our findings in general terms we now
make the following assumptions:
- an action process involves two actors, one truster and one trustee, but no others
- the trustee is an entrepreneur in a business start-up and the truster is an external
actor. No action between the parties has been performed earlier
- the trustee takes the initiative to reach a desired outcome on which
truster
has an impact.
The action process will unfold in a sequence of six steps described below.
Further similar sequences may follow.
1. Trustee's construction of trust
The trustee constructs meaning which would include action with the external
actor, enactment. Meaning is some business outcome. Part of meaning is also
pre-trust: The trustee's trustworthiness in the eyes of the truster will make sense
in the trustee's action. The trustee's meaning is influenced by basic values and
beliefs and stored interpretive schemes. (cf. section 4.3). By interpretive
schemes, the trustee may assess trustworthiness in the eyes of the truster to be
adequate for the trustee's desired outcome. To use trustworthiness in accordance
with the scheme will then be part of constructed meaning. But the trustee may
instead assess trustworthiness in the eyes of truster not to be adequate for desired
outcome, a need to build trustworthiness will enter into the construction of
meaning, and schemes to that end may enter into the meaning construction of the
situation.

<-----Page 162----->163

2. Trustee enacts truster.
Based on trustee's sensemaking the trustee acts involving the truster. In the
action there is an element of using or building trust.
3. Truster interprets action and constructs meaning.
The truster pays attention to the trustee's action and interprets meaning, whether
trustee's action makes sense for the truster. Truster's basic values and beliefs and
stored interpretive schemes guide meaning ascription. Both truster's own
outcomes and trustworthiness concerning the trustee make sense.

<-----Page 163----->164

4. Truster enacts trustee
Based on sensemaking the truster acts involving the trustee. In the action there is
an element of displaying trustworthiness as non-existent, using it or building it.
5. Trustee interprets truster's action.
The trustee pays attention to the truster's action and interprets meaning, whether
truster's action makes sense for the trustee. The trustee's basic values and beliefs
and stored interpretive schemes guide meaning ascription. Both the trustee's own
outcomes and the trustee's trustworthiness in the eyes of the truster make sense.
6. Reciprocal reflection, i.e. trust reconstruction.
Now, at this stage, one sensemaking signal has been given and one received by
each party. This will become the basis for individual or joint reflection on the
process so far. Each party's reflection concerns outcome as well as consequences
for trust, i.e. trust as result of interaction. Reflection may be assimilated into
interpretive schemes or be affected by accommodation. Beliefs may also
change. Reflections may therefore give new insights for each party's
sensemaking henceforward. The action process may continue between the parties
in a new sequence, i.e. as 1 - 6 above again.
Two more elements have been introduced compared to our earlier
analysis. One element is that enactment by one leads to attention and
sensemaking by the other (steps 3 and 5). Plastics sends quarterly financial
reports normally intended for internal control to the bank even though this is not
mandatory. This is regularly done without connection to demand for new credit.
The entrepreneur does so with the future in mind, if a situation with need for
extra support from the bank should occur. In such a contingency it should make
sense for the bank to support Plastics based on Plastics' action. Or as the
entrepreneur in Explosive expressed it concerning another situation:
We always try to play with open cards towards our customers, so during the product
development with Electro we accounted for all costs. They could easily see that we did
not try to exploit or manipulate them. We thought that they would not need to ask so
much later on (9).

When Alpha's managing director was presented with Plastics' solution to
one of Alpha's product development needs, he realised that the ideas were right
but he needed time to think and then work with some attitudes among the
company's distributors. The new solution brought to attention changed ideas
about the product (i.e. accommodation into interpretive schemes). The last

<-----Page 164----->165

example also encompassed the second element: reflections on action (step 6).
Another obvious example concerning reflection is the three years' time span of
project work between Explosive and Gamma. During the action process the
parties entered upon a joint development of ideas concerning products and the
industry as a whole. This is based on a co-operation with ample opportunities for
reflections on action, for example during the yearly evaluation leading to the
next agreement. Reflection concerning trust is the same as construction or
reconstruction of trust as meaning.
We can now pin-point important elements in two actors' sensemaking
trust regarding each other in a model depicting how the individual sensemaking
of each of two actors may affect each other.
Through action and attention the one's individual construction of trust will affect
the other's individual construction of trust. Trust may - to some extent at least be given changed meaning due to clues emanating from another person's trust
(reconstruction). More specifically what are those clues? As we can see from the
above described six-step sequence and depicted in the model in Figure 3,
attention to the other's action is a base for reconstruction of trust, apart from
experience of own action. We can also conclude that interpretive schemes by
accommodation and in the long run also beliefs may be changed. Figure 3 using
the six steps above gives a view of how individual construction of trust becomes
reciprocal construction of trust between two parties.
The next question is whether social construction of trust also means
development towards mutual trust. Our study with its empirical data is not
primarily aimed at the study of mutual trust, but some findings may give us a
clue. The co-operation between Explosive and Gamma had distinct and regular
opportunities for reflection, i.e. trust construction and reconstruction, in
performance evaluation connected to annual renewal of contracts. Reflections
over action performed and possible action for the next period was to a large
extent done jointly. Quite naturally, this gave social construction of trust ample
opportunities to develop. As we have seen above the

relationship was to a large extent by the parties given expressions of mutual trust
with converging views on a large number of common issues. It could from this at
least be proposed that mutual trust can develop by joint attention, action and
meaning construction, by assimilation and accommodation leading to similarities
in interpretive schemes and common beliefs. Joint sensemaking and reciprocal
enactment would promote mutual trust.
Converging meanings can as we saw in the relation between Explosive
and Gamma develop in a virtuous circle: Truster displays trustworthiness for the
trustee, which makes the trustee's trustworthiness for the truster meaningful, the
truster responds with more trustworthiness in the trustee, etc. Converging to
mutual trust implies changes in the parties' original meanings, but not necessarily
symmetrically, one may change meanings more than the other. For example,
Plastics developed different meanings of trust with its customers Alpha and Beta,
respectively, and efforts at development differed. Self-fulfilling prophecies
contain mechanisms of a similar kind: If a trustee's belief in self as trustworthy

<-----Page 166----->167

brings a truster's attention to clues making the trustee's trustworthiness
meaningful for this truster, trustworthiness may be imposed upon the trustee,
which will encourage the trustee to live up to these requirements. The important
thing is that the trustee manages the start of the sequence and presents
him/herself in such a way that the truster in his/her attention brings forward
"right" clues for the trustee's trust-building purpose. It seemed in the interview
with the experienced external actors that they made sense of the entrepreneur's
self, that is the entrepreneur's presenting himself in a genuine way, being honest
etc. Both entrepreneurs on occasions managed very quickly to build personbased trustworthiness, which they then did their utmost to correspond to.
But in the sequence, expectations about trustworthiness may not be
experienced, which will affect meanings and enactment in other ways than if
expectations were fulfilled. The action process with an outcome in mind may be
broken or geared over to another actor. The opposite of converging meaning:
Diverging meaning may create a vicious circle with reciprocal reduction of
trustworthiness in an action process. Since the vicious circle has a starting point
of trust in action, it is more expected to be found between established actors in a
context, not business start-ups. The example described above when Plastics
entered into expanding business with Alpha, displays some elements of a vicious
circle concerning Alpha's former supplier: The more times Alpha experienced
unfulfilled expectation due to deficiencies in delivered lots, the more
trustworthiness was reduced. The supplier could have tried to counter by
improvements to maintain trustworthiness, but did not do so. Trust between the
parties diminished successively, until joint action process ceased.

<-----Page 167----->168

7. 5 Conclusion
This chapter has been devoted to findings in the study concerning how
entrepreneurs and other actors use and build trust in action processes. We have
shown that trust is one meaning the actors give to their action, which affects
enactment and how action processes evolve. In the evolvement of action
processes we have empirical indications that trustworthiness develops in the
actors' interaction and ultimately may become mutual trust. There seem to be
certain ways and patterns of trust development in the action processes.
Furthermore, in attention and action involving two actors, each actor's individual
construction of trust seems to affect the other's individual construction of trust,
which leads to trust being reciprocally constructed between the two parties.
There are also some empirical indications that social construction of trust may
promote the development of mutual trust.
But action processes and trust may also involve more than two actors and
consequently more meanings in the interaction. The next chapter will go into
sensemaking when intermediaries (third parties) come into the play and how the
entrepreneurs by trust strategies involving intermediaries try to cope with more
complicated trust issues in action processes.

<-----Page 168----->169

Chapter 8

Intermediaries for Trust in Action
Processes
The construction of trust is the actor's way of coping with and trying to reduce
equivocality. We have so far seen ways and patterns of how trust develops
mainly in two-actor relations. In this chapter we will go further to action
processes involving an intermediary: a person, group or organisation or an object
symbolising trust. The first step is to see how intermediaries can be enacted by
entrepreneurs in sensemaking of trust in action processes. With this analysis in
mind we will proceed in a second step to the third issue in the purpose of the
study, namely: Do entrepreneurs and external actors in action processes
repeatedly use intermediaries for trust-building and assessment of trust?

8. 1 Intermediaries
In the study it has been possible to identify two patterns of how the entrepreneur
enacted external actors in action processes. One pattern was characterised by
enactment of the external actor that the entrepreneur really considered to be
central for an outcome. This is what would normally be expected, i.e. to build
trustworthiness where it is believed to be needed. The preceding chapter
presented and discussed those patterns. Another pattern concerns enactment of
another external actor than the external actor considered to be central for an
outcome. Trust with one external actor (A) could be built by building trust with
for example another external actor (B) if the entrepreneur considers B's
assessment to be important for A's assessment.
Explosive early made contacts with the National Swedish Board for
Technical Development (NUTEK), which can give financial aid and other kinds
of support to development and commercialisation of innovations in companies.
Later Explosive came up with an innovation, got temporary financial support
from NUTEK and patent rights after further development. For
commercialisation, Explosive needed co-operation with at least one large
Swedish industrial group in manufacturing and some of its sub-contractors. As a

<-----Page 169----->170

developer and not manufacturer, Explosive wanted to sell the patent rights
against contracts for further development to such a group. But Explosive found
itself at odds in negotiation being unknown and acting with the advanced legal
expertise in those resourceful companies. So Explosive asked NUTEK for
negotiating support. NUTEK accepted and after negotiation a contract was
signed between Explosive and the industrial group. NUTEK knew the products
as well as the capability of Explosive. NUTEK also knew what the industrial
groups wanted and how they performed this kind of negotiations. The industrial
groups considered NUTEK to be reliable in assessment of the new and unknown
venture. NUTEK could act a balancing part due to its trust with both parties. The
entrepreneur built trust with an intermediary to use it for building trust with
others connected to the business outcome.

8. 1. 1 Trust Carriers
In the cases have been observed that different kinds of intermediaries
symbolising trust make sense for actors.38 Examples:
- Plastics chose a business form that makes it easier to check the
new
venture's financial position
- both Plastics and Explosive used product certificates,
production and handling safety certificates to secure a market
niche,
i.e. to become the natural supplier in the eyes of certain
customers (These
examples were referred to in chapter 7).
The entrepreneurs consider that these intermediaries make sense to build
trustworthiness in the eyes of external actors. A typical intermediary for
institution-based trust is the quality concept of ISO 9000. Explosive's
entrepreneur commented in this way:
This customer performed a quality review in our company. They came to the conclusion
that we on the whole work according to ISO 9000, even though we are not certified. If
you document, you have to do it properly. Then you follow the law. As Juran said: ISO
9000 is good - if it does not interfere with quality! (1).

38

The notion of intermediary or intermediating actor denotes any third party bridging a gap
between two parties due to distance, be it geographical and/or cultural, psychical, or
technological (Havila, 1996, p. 5). Trust in our framework functions as one way to bridge a
psychical gap.

<-----Page 170----->171

This example shows that the focal actor may enact the intermediary to bring trust
in the eyes of other actors even if the focal actor him/herself considers that the
intermediary may in itself be less important for trust.
To conclude from these examples: Some person or object makes sense to the
new venture to carry trust, useful for the new venture's purposes. A trust carrier
is a mental representation for the entrepreneur believed by him/her to mean trust
for the new venture in trust raters' eyes. A trust carrier can be
- human, a person, a group of persons or an organisation
- object, tangible or intangible
Below this classification will be called: Type of trust carrier. 39
A trust carrier can also be seen as active or passive (Role of trust carrier).
A trust carrier can be seen to actively promote the new venture by own activity
towards trust raters as did NUTEK in one example above. In the other examples
no such activity from the trust carrier was seen. Its role was passive in the
entrepreneur's sensemaking. It takes a human to be active in this sense, so we get
the following possible combinations of type and role:

Type of carrier

Human

Human

Object

Role of carrier

Passive

Active

Passive

These three combinations of type and role: Human + passive, human +
active and object + passive make a starting point for a deeper analysis and
discussion of trust patterns discerned in the cases. This will be the aim of the
next section.

8. 1. 2 Trust "Spill-over" Patterns
When studying the action processes and trust in cases to understand how trust is
used and built it was possible to discern three recurrent patterns for the
entrepreneur to build trust for the new venture in the eyes of external actors (trust
39 The notion of intermediary seems in the literature generally to denote a person, group of
persons or organization. Since the meaning of trust can be carried also by objects, we use the
notion of carrier. It should be remembered that carrier is a product of sensemaking.

<-----Page 171----->172

raters) with a trust carrier in mind. From the discourse with the entrepreneurs and
the external actors, (trust raters), external actors often seemed to base actions
concerning the new venture on other companies, persons, or objects with high
trust in their eyes. These companies, persons or objects also seemed to have
some kind of connection with the new venture. This trust for a third party was
somehow transferred to the new venture - it seemed to "spill over". The new
venture had actually in its own eyes lower trust than the trust carrier, still it got
what it wanted through this other carrier's trust. The entrepreneur (as trustee in
spe) makes sense of the external actor (trust rater) making sense of the trust
carrier. For a "spill-over-effect" to work two double sensemaking processes must
come into the play. The entrepreneur must ascribe trust in the intermediary to
make sense for the external actor (trust rater). The external actor (trust rater)
must make sense of the intermediary's (trust carrier's) making sense of the
entrepreneur (trustee). In short, "spill-over" effect can be defined as: Trust for a
person, organisation or object is by a trust rater by sensemaking automatically/
spontaneously connected/ transferred to the new venture or entrepreneur of
which the rater needs to make sense in terms of trust.
On one hand, trust spill-over can be a decision rationale for the trust rater.
Instead of making own efforts for investigation, the trust rater takes advantage of
some earlier acquired experience about a trustee from a trust carrier, thereby
reducing her/his need for own efforts to investigate the trustee, i.e. the new
venture. Trust spill-over can also be seen as risk-reducing behaviour. The trust
rater relies on a trust carrier in order to reduce risks with unwarranted trust. On
the other hand, an interesting question to be commented on later in this chapter is
whether the entrepreneur and the trust rater deliberately or more automatically
made use of spill-over effects. The notion of "spill-over" is used to cover both
possibilities, not to convey a view of deliberation as the only one.
Let us now by examples investigate the identified three "spill-over"
patterns. The "spill-over" patterns should not be considered as a classification
system, though.40 As we will see there is a considerable overlap and other
patterns can possibly also be discerned.

Plastics expanded its business by first selling to one customer to get a number on
the customer's regular supplier list. Plastics deliberately sought these relations
with well-known industrial companies nation-wide and as exporters. Plastics
used this in its marketing to others. It told customers in spe that it is a supplier to
this and that company (with a good reputation) and gave references. The
entrepreneur:
Lambda came with a product inquiry to us. They asked who else buys from you? I could
mention Kappa. Well, if they buy from you, there cannot be any problem. And so we got
that order. In this way new sales relations have started a number of times (4).

Plastics used its first customers as references to start selling to new ones. The
entrepreneur commented:
To show others that we deliver to a well-known company creates trust and is a basis for
others to start trusting us (4).

These customers based further action involving Plastics on this information.
Either knowledge about its supplier situation was sufficient to start doing
business with Plastics, or the information about well-known customers was
important to elicit a small order on a trial basis. Another example is the
following: Plastics got very much help at the start from local craftsmen and
business people because they knew members of his family, who had been wellknown industrialists in the area. A third example: At the start of Explosive its
entrepreneurs were very often identified as former employees in their incubating
company, which facilitated marketing competence and product ideas.
In these examples the new venture made use of a trust carrier outside of
the new venture itself: Trust "spilled over". The companies, the entrepreneur's
family and Incubator in the examples did not do anything in particular in the
action process to promote the new venture's interest, i.e. they were passive
human trust carriers in the terminology above. But they had high trust in the eyes
of trust raters, who then acted as if they trusted the new venture. The passive
human trust carrier simply was there but was not actively involved in
transferring trust. The trust carrier made sense as a reference for the
entrepreneur. A reference person is supposed to give statements about another
person's character, abilities etc.41 The value of a reference is based on the
reference's trust in the eyes of the person seeking the information, often even
41 Note that the word reference denotes either the (potential) information given or the
(potential) informer. The notion of trust reference for human passive trust carrier denotes the
(potential) informer in this study.

<-----Page 173----->174

without contact between the information seeker and reference. The thing the trust
raters and the trust carrier had in common was a connection with the new
venture, which the raters knew. The necessary double sensemaking for trust
"spill-over" to occur, included the entrepreneur making sense of trust carriers and
trust raters also making sense of the trust carriers. Part of both sensemaking
processes concerned the trust carrier's connection with the trustee. A passive
human trust carrier must in the eyes of the trust rater have 1) high own trust, and
2) a connection with the new venture.
In the analysis of interview data and documents of the two cases it was
found that in these situations the entrepreneur made sense of a desired outcome
and at least one rater. For a rater one or more trust reference can make sense in
the eyes of the entrepreneur. The following outcomes, raters and agents were
found:
Outcome: Start of the new venture, Financial improvement, Market position,
New product, Purchase, Sales.
Trust raters: Authority, Bank, Co-operating company, Customer, Supplier.
Trust reference: Accountant, Authority, Business Consultant, Customer, Family,
Former employer, Prize committee, Product, Supplier, Technical consultant.
Example of how a situation could be composed: For the outcome
Development of a new patented product (PD) a customer (C1), the bank for
capital (B), a co-operating producer for components (P) etc. could be made
sense. For any trust rater one or more trust reference/-s could be made sense in
the entrepreneur's eyes. For the customer (C1) this could be another well-known
customer (C2) of the new venture with similar needs, a sister company that is a
supplier to the new venture (S) etc. Graphically illustrated:

For every possible outcome there are a number of possible trust raters and
a number of possible trust references. This pattern can be generalised: For
Outcome (O1...n) Raters (R1...n) make sense and could be conceived References
(Ref1...n).

8.1.2.2 Trust Carrier that is Active and Human: Trust Agent
The situations in the last section contained human trust carriers that were
passive. This section will highlight situations with trust carriers that explicitly act
to promote the new venture to trust raters. Both Explosive and Plastics got new
customers by existing customers telling potential customers about the companies
and products. The old customers' activity gave them new ones. As expressed in
discussion with Explosive:
Respondent: The customers we work with have been very useful, because of their
contacts. Since our customers know us very well they can say who we are and what we
do.
Researcher: Have you got any orders in this way?
Respondent: Yes, we have (1).

When Plastics needed additional funding from the bank, the entrepreneur asked
Almi for assistance in the negotiation. Almi actively supported Plastics with
arguments to the bank. Plastics' entrepreneur:
We had Almi with us as a balancing part. Had they not been our co-partner I think the
bank would have killed us (4).

<-----Page 175----->176

A human trust carrier outside the new venture acted to promote the new
venture in a situation, i.e. active role of human trust carrier, a trust agent. An
agent can be defined as a person who acts for another. In this context a person or
an organisation acts for the new venture by using its own trust. A trust agent
differs from a trust reference by being active in promoting the new venture. An
agent defines him-/herself. Other trust carriers are defined by the rater. An agent
is normally in close interaction with the new venture, a reference could be more
distant from the new venture. A trust agent (active human trust carrier) must in
the eyes of the trust rater 1) have a good knowledge about the new venture, 2)
have high own trust, and 3) give information about the new venture normally
implying trust.
The new ventures and the trust agents in the cases normally had close
contact with each other. Sometimes this could mean that the new venture
consciously selects a trust agent, which Explosive did on several occasions.
However, there was not necessarily any specific activity by the new venture to
do that. The agent that takes on this role had often a business interest or a
mission (e.g. Almi), which is promoted by acting as an agent. The agent is not
necessarily altruistic but acts from self-interest. The situations are characterised
by the work of three processes of sensemaking. In addition to the two concerning
the entrepreneur and trust rater discussed above, the active role of the trust agent
implies her/his making sense of trust in the entrepreneur. If trust concerning the
entrepreneur were not meaningful for a potential trust agent, s/he would not act.
Trust agent situations can - and in one of the cases actually did - represent a very
efficient means for the new venture. Explosive managed to expand its trust by
supplementary efforts from outside resources. The agent works from a higher
level of trust and the entrepreneur uses the agents' resources to compensate the
new venture's own scarcity. In the analysis of interview data and documents of
the two cases we found the entrepreneurs made sense of the following outcomes,
raters and agents:
Outcome: External Funding, Product development, Product prize, Purchase,
Sales, Start of the new venture.
Raters: Bank, Customer, Supplier.
Agents: Authority, Customer, Business consultant, Technical consultant.
Example: For the outcome of raising external funds in a financially
critical situation (F) the entrepreneur made sense of the following raters: The

<-----Page 176----->177

bank for providing capital (B), Suppliers for extending credits (S) and the
customer (C) for assurance of payment. For every trust rater one or more agents
could in his eyes be possible. For the bank as trust rater Almi, regional
development authorities, and a technical consultant could be agents. Graphically
illustrated:
Outcome

For every possible outcome there is a number of possible raters and a
number of possible agents. This pattern can be generalised: For Outcome
(O1...n) Raters (R1...n) make sense and could be conceived Agents (A1...n).

8.1.2.3 Trust Carrier that is Passive and an Object: Trust
Sign
A trust sign displays to trust raters positive facts about the new venture and its
products with the effect of promoting trust. In this sense trust signs are of course
often used in industrial marketing in general. Here the discussion is restricted to
trust signs used to enhance the trust of the new venture in the eyes of trust raters,
i.e. were given symbolic representation involving trust. Plastics often gives
potential customers samples as a reference on its products. The samples are to be
seen as a sign of functionality, quality, design etc. performed by the
manufacturer. Often samples are not exactly the product the potential customer is
looking for, still it is a sign of what the producer can accomplish, meant to
convey enterprise-based trustworthiness. Certificates are signs of competence
and/or quality. Product certification is important for Plastics, due to customers'
needs for acid or heat resistant material:
We look forward to certification of our new series of components. That will create new
business opportunities in the chemical-technical industry. We will make better use of our
production capacity, larger business volume, increased turn-over. I have it from the
purchasing manager in Omikron that if these components are certified according to their

<-----Page 177----->178
wishes, he will place orders here in the range of half a million kronor on a yearly basis
(8).

Hanging on the conference room wall at Explosive, clearly visible to
visitors, is put the invitation they received to the final award meeting for the
Swedish Nobel Skapa innovation contest (cf. also section 7.2.6). The innovation
contest concerns a prize, which the winner gets at a ceremony in connection with
the yearly Technical Fair in Stockholm. Several organisations stand behind it.
Explosive came to the final and when interviewed there, one of the entrepreneurs said:
The prize is important. Being able to show the company to the technical journals, to
representatives of Swedish and international industry (Nerikes Allehanda 1994-06-23).

The importance was later commented on by the entrepreneur in this way.
The purpose for us is to influence existing and new customers. An inexpensive way of
marketing. Another purpose: Trust between supplier and customer. This will strengthen
undecided buyers, because this product has been assessed by impartial people and was
nominated for such an advanced prize (9).

A sign is an object that can make sense concerning trust. The new venture
uses a sign as a symbol for something it wants to point out to one or more trust
raters. A sign could be anything making sense for a desired message. A sign in a
more restricted sense could be objects like those above, a product sample or a
prize nomination, material or immaterial. The notion of sign denotes in this study
the object type of trust carrier and the passive role of carrier.
In the terminology of the study, what is the difference between trust sign
on one hand, and trust reference and trust agent on the other? Sign is an object,
not a human being. Sign is sensemaking of a trust carrier that is normally more
inside the new venture (a product etc.), whereas the other two concepts, as
discussed above, denote carriers outside the new venture. A sign can be a clue to
trust in the new venture in the eyes of a rater, the other two trust in someone/something else that could be connected to the new venture. This conceptual
demarcation does not rule out the possibility that a combination of spill-over
effects could come into attention and be given meaning in a specific situation. In
fact one of the examples above could be seen in that way: The displaying of the
letter from the Nobel Skapa Committee could by a trust rater be meaningful as a
trust sign and at the same time it brings spill-over effect from trust reference. To
be effective, a sign must in the eyes of a rater imply trust. In the analysis of data
of the two cases we found that the entrepreneurs made sense of the following
outcomes, raters and signs:

<-----Page 178----->179

Outcome: Purchase, Sales, Start of the new venture.
Raters: Authority, Co-operating company, Customer, Competitor, Financer,
Prize committee, Supplier.
Signs: Accounting documents (Financial indicators), Bank account, Civil
engineer (title), Certificate, Doctor of Technology (title), Firm registration
number, Patent, Product Prize, Supplier number, Taxes paid.
Example: For the outcome of start of the new venture (TNV) the
entrepreneur made sense of trust raters: customers (C), suppliers (S) and
financers (F). In the entrepreneur's eyes a supplier wants signs that the firm is
legally registered (Reg), has funds to pay (Bank account) and proper payment
procedures (Giro). The example can be illustrated in this way:
Outcome

TNV

Raters

Signs

C

S

Reg
Bank
Giro

F

For every possible outcome there are a number of possible trust raters and
a number of possible signs. This pattern can be generalised: For Outcome
(O1...n) Raters (R1...n) make sense and could be conceived Signs (Si1...n).

8. 1. 3 Conclusions Concerning Intermediaries in
Sensemaking Trust
Out of the case data we have identified, discussed and conceptualised some
intermediaries that carry trust in the eyes of trustee and/or truster. Such trust
carriers: persons, groups, organisations or objects are by actors given symbolic
representation concerning trust. A symbol is a representation that stands for

<-----Page 179----->180

some other entity (cf. section 3.2.7), and the trust carriers take on signals that
convey trust in the form of insurances, guarantees etc. (cf. section 4.3.2 and
Zucker, 1986). They can also function in an active or passive role in the process.
An expression used in this study is that trust "spills over" to a trustee from a trust
carrier in a truster's eyes. The entrepreneurs in the study have made sense of such
effects repeatedly. These effects underlie patterns in action and consequently in
accordance with the study's theoretical basis these patterns can be seen as
interpretive schemes. Actors (persons) and events are prominent in these
schemes (cf. section 3.2.5).
Spill-over effects may have wide implications if sets of beliefs concerning
trustees become widespread. In section 4.1.4 reputation and the intermediary role
in trust conveyed by reputation was discussed. The empirical data of this study
can not give any conclusions concerning the role and function of reputation,
since only the entrepreneurs' most immediate context was studied. But the notion
of spill-over effects and conceptualisation of intermediaries done in this study
could be a point of departure for studying reputation. This will be discussed
more in chapter 9.

8. 2 Strategies in Sensemaking Trust
In section 8.1 we have presented and discussed how trust carriers could be given
symbolic representation concerning trust and different kinds of trust carriers
have been identified. Now the question is how this symbolic representation was
applied by the entrepreneurs in the action processes in the cases. That is also to
say, we will try to characterise the entrepreneurs' interpretive schemes
concerning trust and intermediaries.
We see three ways of characterising the interpretive schemes, whether:
1) the entrepreneur applies ways of action concerning trust and intermediaries
consciously or more automatically,
2) the entrepreneur makes sense of simple interpretive schemes, e.g. always one
specific way of trust-building involving intermediaries or different ways of trustbuilding, and
3) it is a separate action or maybe part of a connected chain of steps taken to
build and use trust to enhance some business outcome.
Trust strategy is here defined as an interpretive scheme implying a pattern or
connected sequence of actions for trust, made sense by the new venture to

<-----Page 180----->181

promote an outcome. A trust strategy implies: 1) ways of action concerning trust,
often consciously involving intermediaries, and 2) a connected chain of steps
taken to build and use trust. Schemes can imply one specific way of trustbuilding involving intermediaries, or different ways of trust-building. Patterns or
connected sequences imply that time is an element. If the entrepreneur should
have a tendency over time to display similar actions for trust in similar situations,
it is a trust strategy.
One question concerning trust strategy is whether interpretive schemes are
consciously selected and controlled or less consciously and automatically
applied. Lord & Foti (1986, p. 21) contend that controlled processing of schemes
places heavy demand on our limited capacity to pay attention. It requires much
thinking. Automatic processing, on the other hand, demands less attention and is
used in very familiar situations where it allows us to operate with little thought
or strain. Looking at the situations above in this chapter, there are characteristics
and similarities in the entrepreneurs' handling of the situations: they can express
very clear-cut and developed motives for their ways of action. This could lead to
the conclusion that schemes in the cases are always consciously applied. It is,
however, necessary to make two reservations here: The data was collected after
the events, and there is a possibility that the respondents rationalised motives and
thoughts in retrospect (cf. section 5.4). It may therefore, at least partly, reflect
their making sense of calculated action. But it has been possible to cross-check
some of the actions and events with external actors involved, who have given
accounts supporting a high degree of the entrepreneurs' control of motives for
action. The second reservation is that automatic scheme processing may need
more data than the scope of this study to become visible. For evident reasons the
actors themselves highlight consciously made decisions and motives for them,
which will tend to dominate their tales in interviews. Let us look into the data.
Some of the data is now familiar to the reader, it is brought up again for this new
purpose.

8. 2 .1 Focused Trust Strategies
Explosive displays a tendency to enact trust agents to promote its interest. They
nurtured relations with Almi and NUTEK and built trust in the eyes of these
actors. When they needed a trust agent to promote their interest in negotiations
concerning product development, they asked NUTEK for help, which was then
given (cf. also section 8.1). And Almi has been used as trust agent in two ways,
as explained by Explosive's entrepreneur:

<-----Page 181----->182

We have seen to it that we have good relations with Almi. Three times we have been
nominated for the Alfred Nobel Skapa- prize. This has also enabled us to deepen
relations with Almi. And then, when we have a product idea and want co-operating
parties in exploitation, it is sometimes a tough burden to convince others of the
advantages. On such occasions, Almi has been useful (1).

So, Explosive consciously looks for trust agents, to have as a trusting ally when
they want to promote an invention or a business idea. The role of the agent is to
compensate for the venture's own lack of resources in terms of marketing, legal
expertise or other capacity. Enacting the trust agent is not an isolated action, it is
a tendency. It is in our terms a consciously applied interpretive scheme, has a
certain complexity in using at least two ways of action and is repetitive.
Concerning the product contests the entrepreneur commented:
Researcher: The purpose of participation in contests?
Respondent: It is a good way of marketing, that does not cost so much. And increases
trust between us and potential buyers. It helps them to become convinced, since
assessment by impartial people has actually brought us nomination to such an advanced
prize three times (9).

The prize is a trust sign, which could be used in the long run to strengthen
relations to customers. It brings also a spill-over effect from the prize committee.
It is important for trust (reputation) to be nominated several times, repeatedly.
Headlines in two local newspapers at the third nomination after the prize
committee's press conference: "Good idea gave them another nomination"
(Karlskoga Tidning, 1993-06-05) "First in the world, again!" (Direkt, No. 5/93)
Plastics enacts trust signs and spill-over effect in the long run.
We have proven our specific position in the niche by doing things others haven't done.
But it takes a very long time. You must work for references. You must have so called
records. A potential customer, Lambda, came with a request on a product. I could
mention our customer Kappa, show details. 'Well, if they buy from you there cannot be
any problems", Lambda said. So we got that order. And so it has continued. [...] We sold
some details to our customer Beta, that business is still running. We got a supply number
in Beta. We also got a supply number at Epsilon, a component no others have managed to
make. I consider relations with the customer Epsilon important, not as business but as
reference. To show others that we sell to them creates trustworthiness and a basis for
others to risk doing business with us. I use this often when we contact new customers. I
mention it. For prestige we must have such references and reference products to expand
business (4).

This excerpt from an interview shows that when Plastics markets its products,
the potential customer's need for a decision rationale leads them to enact
references and signs of Plastics being a supplier to well-known Swedish

<-----Page 182----->183

companies. This is not an isolated occasion. Plastics has found this useful as a
repeated normal procedure to point at "records" and well-known company names
as trust signs and to take advantage of trust spill-over effects. Trust signs become
the basis for interpretive schemes brought in on several occasions when similar
business outcomes make sense for the actor.
Another forceful way to expand market is to enact and systematically use
certificates (trust signs), which is explicitly done by both ventures. Plastics takes
every opportunity to get their products certified. The entrepreneurs make sense
of certification as a trust sign denoting competence and quality in products,
necessary for business outcomes, as this interview statement indicates:
Certificates can be decisive for us to get the order or not, and that much more than the
price. It is a competitive advantage, decreases competition in our own area. And I am
working for that. It means to cut competition by making the threshold higher for our
competitors, to be the first in certified products good for the environment (4).

One thing is common for the examples and discussion of trust strategy
above: Firstly, the entrepreneurs make sense of one specific trust pattern useful
(e.g. carriers, either references, agents or signs). Secondly, the trust carriers are
given symbolic meaning concerning trust. Thirdly, they use that pattern
repeatedly and connect positive experience from one situation to later situations.
This line of trust strategy could be called focused trust strategy.

<-----Page 183----->184

8. 2. 2 Multiplex Trust Strategies
But there can also be discerned another pattern of trust strategy. It is
characterised by an applied pattern of different ways of trust-building in steps.
Section 8.1 has in short quoted a large project in which Explosive is - or wishes
to become - a central part. The project concerns a large business or product
development situation, complex in its action processes and with a large number
of trust raters. Another example was also discussed above concerning a strategy
using trust agents. Let us reconsider now the second example in the light of trust
strategy using a chain of different ways of trust-building:
Respondent: No one has attended to the problem how this product can be disposed of in a
good way for the environment. We have developed a business idea how it could be
accomplished. We are implanting the idea now with a lot of different parties involved.
We have discussed it thoroughly with Almi and have some contacts with authorities. We
think that we should be given the task of managing a system for product disposal in an
authorised way. The state county administration and Almi agree on that. We form a
subsidiary company in which necessary capital is invested. We bring competence and
technical solutions, investors bring capital, together we start operating from this idea. A
new niche for us.
Researcher: How important is the dialogue?
Respondent: Important, because in the end authorities must give guidelines. We must be
on the same line as them. We must meet their requirements with a company that can run
the operations. We have also involved the authority Sigma in the discussions. No one
disagrees, but the whole matter must mature a little.
Researcher: To live up to guidelines, are you sure that the authorities can give workable
guidelines in this new area, so that all will work well?
Respondent: They can only give guidelines based on relevant facts. We can give them
facts that will become the basis for their decisions. In this way we get the decisions we
need. Lobbying.
Researcher: It seems you consider it important to tell them how this should be
accomplished?
Respondent: Exactly. Explain to them problems that might come if it is run in the wrong
way, so that they, so to speak, realise that this must run in a specific way. Then of course
it is not wrong if that is our way!
Researcher: Do you consciously mean that it is good to influence them in such a way that
there will be guidelines fitting your competence, your way of working and so on?
Respondent: Yes, definitely (1). We can influence them by presenting solutions to bring
about decisions in the right direction. Plus that we will work even harder in the near
future with the customer Zeta about the disposal. After all it is Zeta as the producer, that
in the end will be responsible for making disposal of its products possible (9).

<-----Page 184----->185

Explosive in this example enacts a chain of trust steps. First the new venture
secures the support of its trust agent. Then it attempts to get trust in its
competence in the eyes of relevant authorities for rules and regulations. In this
discussion the new venture attempts to use its competence and/or product trust to
become the natural supplier of technical solutions for the new prospective
industry, to be backed up by the authorities (trust spill-over). Furthermore,
Explosive, by being in the middle of the dialogue, tries to get early information
on rules and regulations that are to come. They count on being in the field
immediately when the new system starts, which means that Explosive could,
before others, convey trust easily all around, incl. customers. And it also
attempts to use its position (trust in its competence) to influence the new rules
and systems in a way that suits its competence and development plans.
In the example above the new venture enacts an array of different steps to
build trustworthiness. The entrepreneurs in the case count on an effect from
combinations they consciously and consequently apply. Almi, authorities and
their regulations, and a company are conceived as symbolic representations
concerning trust that Explosive (trustee) wants to display for potential customers
(trusters), The pattern is not focused on one specific way of building trust,
instead in applying a combination of different ways. This line of trust strategy
could be called multiplex trust strategy.

8. 2. 3 Trust Strategies as Interpretive Schemes
Trust strategies work as interpretive schemes focused on patterns of action and
also containing actors and events. They possess causal or temporal ordering of
events (cf. section 3.2.5) Above we distinguished between focused and multiplex
trust strategies. As compared to examples regarding focused trust strategies, the
multiplex trust strategy example contains more different or more complicated
interpretive schemes applied. If we look at the background of the situations, the
entrepreneurs base their action on long term learning in the industry in the
forerunner to Explosive, i.e. in Incubator. And they continue to work as they did
in Incubator (see section 5.5.2), along with the tradition in the industry. Seen as
interpretive schemes, there is a long development of schemes, where assimilation
successively forms schemes with trust based on established ways of acting.
(Instititution-based trust) But the situation is partly new to the entrepreneurs who
make sense of e.g. environmental requirements which become accommodated
into interpretive schemes. So the multiplex trust strategy is characterised by both
assimilation and accommodation of schemes in enacting the situations. A rich

<-----Page 185----->186

array of experience stored in interpretive schemes will probably enhance
viability in sensemaking situations and bring forward variety in possible actions.
This may promote both adaptation and change within the setting where the
entrepreneur acts. On the other hand, the situations with more focused trust
strategies seem more to cover situations where the entrepreneur makes sense of
adapting to the external actors' interpretation of meanings in the situation. This
may imply more automatic enactment of interpretive schemes once they are
stored, assimilation of experience in different situations but less accommodation.

8. 3 Conclusion
In this chapter we have studied the construction of trust in action processes
involving not only truster and trustee but also intermediaries. The more actors
involved the more different constructions of trust (meanings) come into the play.
The most complicated action processes, bringing in even more equivocality,
encompass actors with very different roles in the process. For example in section
3.2.8 we contrasted commercial, institutional and personal contexts for actors,
which may bring very varied meanings to bear when actors from different
contexts take part in an action process. One actor may also enact another actor in
very different ways.
In these complex situations the entrepreneur needs to facilitate reduction
of equivocality. Experience manifests itself in interpretive schemes, which may
contain persons, events and types of action (see section 3.2.5) and will become
guiding lines in different situations. From the case data we identified patterns of
seeing actors, intermediaries and action that were relevant in trust construction.
We conceptualised trust carriers, i.e. third party intermediaries (human and
objects) given symbolic representation concerning trust, where the effects spill
over from a third party trusted by a truster to a trustee. We also identified
strategies using trust carriers which trustees tended to enact towards trusters to
promote trust. These trust strategy patterns were discussed in terms of
interpretive schemes.

Chapter 9

Implications of the Study
9. 1 The Findings' Contribution to Theory
In section 1.1 the main purpose of the study was set to contribute to
entrepreneurial theory regarding entrepreneurship by concept-building with a
focus on action processes and trust. In this approach three distinct research issues
were formulated, which will be commented in section 9.1.1.
The notion of generative capacity denotes to what extent a theory
building study actually contributes to existing theory (cf. section 5.4). A study
performed with generative capacity in mind requires presenting the "state-of-theart" on the research area as a starting point for the study. The next need is an
appropriate methodology to make the study generative. These two requirements
were met with in a way which was summarised in section 5.6. That is to say: Out
of theory of entrepreneurship, action processes and trust were formulated
sensitising concepts (Blumer, 1954). These were confronted with case data to
confirm or contradict, to qualify and extend the concepts into developed
concepts, patterns and other commonalities. The conceptual findings of the study
can be compared with the theories used, and contributions can then be discerned,
which is the purpose of this chapter.

9. 1. 1 A Taxonomy of New Venture Trust
The underlying belief in this study is that a taxonomy of concepts regarding new
venture trust brings benefits to understanding phenomena and to further
knowledge-building. Such a taxonomy can be used as a guiding framework to
theory-building in further studies. A taxonomy focuses the researcher's problem
identification and attention to research issues. A taxonomy of concepts thus
becomes a tool and a platform for knowledge-building. In this vein the findings
will be commented on and discussed in this section.
The first research issue was: What are the external actor's bases for trust
in the entrepreneur and the new venture? The three bases of trust, person-based,
enterprise-based and institution-based trust were formulated out of views and

<-----Page 187----->188

terminology of Zucker (1986): process-based, characteristics-based and
institutional-based trust (cf. section 4.1.1). In Zucker's notion of process-based
trust the decision or inclination to trust is contingent on a record of prior
exchange often obtained second-hand or by imputation from outcomes of prior
exchange. The prevailing view is that persons and firms make investments in
process-based trust by creating positive "reputations" or brand-names (Zucker,
1986, p. 61). In characteristics-based trust all that is necessary is information
concerning social similarity (Zucker, 1986, p. 61). Similarity in family
background or social situation may be sought out as a basis for common
understanding and for attaining reciprocally satisfactory exchange outcomes.
Institutional-based trust is tied to formal societal structures, depending on
individual or firm-specific attributes. Formal mechanisms are used to provide
trust which does not rest on personal characteristics or on past history of
exchange. Formal mechanisms can be membership in a sub-culture, such as a
well-known professional association, or intermediary mechanisms, such as
commonly accepted procedures. The findings from our study indicate that trust
concerning the new venture is broader. Particularly, person-based trust denotes
more than indicated by Zucker's characteristics-based trust which is biased
towards family and social background. Thus, competence/experience and
managerial /commercial capacity was found to be very important for studied
external actor's construction of trust concerning the entrepreneur. Enterprisebased trust was first given two main meanings, based on literature at hand: trust
in products delivered and financial resources available in the venture. By
confrontation of this sensitising concept with interview data the notion became
both broadened and enriched. A prominent broadening was indications that the
new venture (trustee) could be important for the other company (truster) in a
situation by being complementary in different ways. One way is that it had or did
develop something that the truster needs or desires. Another way was to bring
novelty to the industry. Therefore, a new dimension of enterprise-based trust was
introduced, pertaining to the new venture as an organisation, its general
capabilities. An example of enrichment of the notion of trust in products
delivered is the following. Not only quality, quantity and timing is conducive to
trust but also the trusters' assessment of how strategically important delivery
seemed to be for the new venture (trustee) itself, i.e. conditions around a delivery
mattered for the truster to trust the trustee. Our findings regarding institutionbased trust were congruent with Zucker's institutional-based trust. In all, our
findings confirm, but give a more extended picture of what constitutes actors'
trust bases. Our study concerning the bases of trust has set a framework for
dimensions in new venture trust which can work as a platform for further

<-----Page 188----->189

elaboration. For example can different actors' meanings of trust be highlighted
and their differences over time in the start-up process be described and
characterised.
Barber's (1983), Luhmann's (1979) and Zucker's (1986) views concerning
the role and importance of expectation underlying trust is confirmed in this
study. But it has in addition brought new reference points to expectation by the
notion of pre-trust and trust as a result of interaction. When expectation is
studied 1) over time, 2) in a process, or 3) before and after a specific event,
expectation as pre-trust and trust as result of interaction could be delineated and
compared. By juxtaposition of pre-trust and trust as a result of interaction,
studies may highlight differences and contribute to a more clear picture of how
expectation changes. These concepts are also an illustration of the benefits of this
study's perspective: By seeing new ventures as action processes building on
actors' sensemaking, it is possible to identify trust and how trust develops.
The study has a basic view on trust as meaning in action, and more
specifically the study undertakes to investigate the research issue: How do
entrepreneurs and external actors use and build trust in action processes? The
study has focused on trust development - as opposed to a more common view in
the literature of trust as a state. Two conceptual tools were built in the study to
acquire further opportunity to study changes in expectations concerning trust,
specifically with reference to actors in an action process. The concepts use
trust/worthiness/ and build trust/worthiness/ facilitate understanding how trust
functions in action processes and relationships between parties as described in
chapter 7. The concepts can also work as reference points on an ordinal
measurement scale concerning the development of trust, i.e. meanings of "more"
and "less". Finally, to study trust in action processes using the combination of
pre-trust/trust as a result of interaction and use/build trustworthiness, makes it
possible to discern patterns. Social construction of trust between actors is an
example where these notions were highly rewarding for description and analysis
(see the discussion about interplay between two actors' construction of trust,
section 7.4).
Regarding the study of our third research issue: Do entrepreneurs and
external actors in action processes use intermediaries for trust-building and
assessment of trust? a number of action processes were found to involve
intermediaries: persons, groups/organisations or objects symbolising trust in the
eyes of trustee and/or truster. The entrepreneurs as trustees often managed to
convey external actor's (truster's) trust for the intermediary over to the trustee.
This phenomenon was in the study labelled spill-over effects. The role of
intermediaries in mediating trust has been described (e.g. Barber, 1983; Zucker,

<-----Page 189----->190

1986), but these authors' publications have not developed the views and concepts
to the extent done in this study. A classification scheme was developed which
brings attention to the findings that both people and objects functioned as
intermediaries for trust. Human intermediaries also vary as to whether they
actively support the trustee or not. As trust carriers were identified 1) trust
references, which are a human type of carrier with passive role, i.e. not
themselves promoting the interests of the trustee, 2) trust agents, also human
type of carrier but working actively towards the truster to promote the trustee,
and 3) trust signs, i.e. objects implying trust in the trustee. These findings have
implications for entrepreneurship studies, particularly concerning different third
party functions in action processes. For example can the impact of reputation be
described, analysed and understood using this terminology. The classification
scheme - or a further elaboration of it - may facilitate knowledge-building
concerning complex networks and particularly processes behind their
development. The "spill-over"-effect as a prominent pattern of meaning
construction has in our view a rich potential as a study issue. The "spill-over" effect may very well be important to trust in other settings as well as generally in
studies concerning social construction. The concepts concerning trust carriers
and the phenomenon of "spill-over"-effects also opens up for studying
symbolism in both entrepreneurship and trust, which will be discussed later in
this chapter.
The work with concepts facilitated identification of patterns of action and
actors' meaning construction. Trust development patterns were induced from
data concerning the development of relationships between the entrepreneur and
external actors. Combining the notions of using and building trust with meanings
of trust (i.e. trust bases) in a time frame gave three sequence patterns of how
person-based, enterprise-based and institution-based trustworthiness was given
meaning. Such patterns are seldom to be found in the literature due to a lack of
time and process oriented studies.42 The patterns can be seen as a framework for
other studies and could then be further elaborated.
Trust strategy was defined as a pattern or connected sequence of actions
for trust, made sense by the new venture to promote an outcome. The identified
tendency to display similar actions for trust in similar situations can, in our view,
explain action in many circumstances. It can be seen as interpretive schemes
42

Close to ours in views and general approaches, although not the research issues, is the study
of van de Ven & Poole, (1990): Methods for Studying Innovation Development in the
Minnesota innovation research programme. This programme works also with inductive concept
building, pattern identification and it studies processes over time. However, the programme
resources enable wider aims, and quite a different scope of information management, etc. than
our study.

<-----Page 190----->191

(Weick, 1979, Lord & Foti, 1986), denoting structured sets of pre-existing views,
patterns of events/actions that can contribute to meaning and action. In the study
entrepreneurs were found to consequently apply patterns of action for building
trust with use of intermediaries. Some trust strategies incorporated a complex set
of actors and sequences of action. These multiplex trust strategies, implied a
combination of different ways for the entrepreneur to build trust, others
expressed a more automatic response in well-articulated situations using the
same specific way of trust-building (focused trust strategies). The concept of
trust strategy may have implications for theory (as well as practice) regarding explanation and prediction of action. The notion of interpretive scheme has been
useful in identifying patterns, particularly concerning trust strategies, by opening
up for possible explanations of the phenomena. Therefore we believe that it may
be rewarding in future to study one of the traditional issues in entrepreneurship
research, namely the entrepreneur's locus-of-control, using a sensemaking
approach as an alternative or a complement to the traditional personal traits and
characteristics view (cf. section 2.2.5).
We will in the sections below continue to discuss possible contributions to
the specific areas of theory within or close to the study's frame of reference.

9. 1. 2 The Entrepreneur in Context and a Process
View
In chapter 2 a range of different perspectives on entrepreneurship was presented
in order to give the background to selection of a more recent and yet not very
often used perspective: the entrepreneur seen as an individual-in-context. The
conceptual article by Gartner, Bird & Starr (1992) gives the ideas behind this
perspective and indicates a possible direction for development (cf. section 1.2).
Our study shows that it is possible to go further than indicated in the article.
Arguing that it is necessary first to present part of Gartner's et al. (1992) discussion in some more detail.
They position themselves against how social psychology provides insights
into understanding factors that influence an individual's behaviour. Doing so
they use the foremost theory building within that line of research, namely
theories of motivation. Traditionally, motivational theories have the fundamental
orientation that behaviour is a function of both person (traits and characteristics
such as motivation) and environment. Gartner et al. (1992) bring emphasis to the
contextual factors that influence the motivations of individuals in organisational
creation. Furthermore, through the lens of emergence the entrepreneur is often

<-----Page 191----->192

critical to the process of changing the equivocality of interactions among a
number of different individuals into the non-equivocal interactions of an
organisation. How entrepreneurs motivate others is then a typical question. They
conclude that motivation can be used as a tool-kit of ways that entrepreneurs
influence others. Still bent on motivation, Gartner et al. (1992) apply this view to
different types of motivation theory: need, reinforcement, equity and expectancy.
They present a number of possible research questions where motivation is seen
as actively used by entrepreneurs.
However, as we see it, by building their discussion on motivation, they
overlook some of the potential in their own ideas. Motivation is not defined in
the article but they seem to mean "something inspiring to action". The notion
automatically leads your attention to one individual: Does the entrepreneur
motivate others? etc. The thinking is stuck to just one individual at a time, be it
the entrepreneur or someone else. But interaction must be seen as reciprocal:
One influences the other, and the other influences the first one. The notion of
trust, as applied in this study, automatically brings attention to the interplay
between individuals. Furthermore, Gartner et al. (1992) use the notion of
behaviour in the article more than the notion of action. Behaviour is traditionally
built on a structural view, which may imply seeing the individual as a
demarcated component and may impede attention to interaction. The
contribution of this study to the individual-in-context perspective is the insight
that the perspective may need to build theory on entrepreneurial action, posing
research questions and using concepts focusing on interaction and being
consistent in seeing action in a process view.

9. 1. 3 Business Trust and Action Processes
This study may have implications concerning trust in a wider range of business
settings than just new ventures. A discussion of this study in relation to trust in
some recent marketing and management studies can point at possible
contributions. Trust is acknowledged as important in marketing channel
literature (Anderson & Narus, 1990; Hallén, Johanson & Seyed-Mohamed,
1991) as well as in studies oriented to relationship in marketing or inter-firm
relationships (Dwyer, Schurr & Oh, 1987; Larson, 1992; McAllister, 1995;
Moorman, Deshpandé & Zaltman, 1993; Schurr & Ozanne, 1985; Sullivan,
Peterson, Kameda & Shimada, 1981; Sullivan & Peterson, 1982). The approach
is generally to investigate the content of trust and causal relationships are studied
between different variables of which trust is one. Trust is seen as either a

<-----Page 192----->193

precondition to some outcome (Hallén et al., 1991; Schurr & Ozanne, 1985), an
intervening variable (Anderson & Narus, 1990), a result of independent variables
(Sullivan et al., 1981) or its characteristics are studied (Moorman et al., 1993).
Some of the studies come to the conclusion that longitudinal studies would be a
natural extension of their study (Anderson & Narus, 1990; McAllister, 1995;
Sullivan & Peterson 1982). Anderson & Narus (1990) write:
Longitudinal research could be directed at sets of "core" constructs, making possible
better inferences about their development over time and their causal sequence. (p. 55).

Larson (1992) investigated dyadic alliances between established, high-tech, fast
growing firms and their customers and suppliers in a process oriented study.43
The alliances were characterised by existing relationships being used for new
exchanges. Even if trust was not the main study aim, Larson found that
relationships were governed in important ways by social controls arising from
norms of reciprocity and trust. Another striking similarity with our findings is
that what we call person-based and institution-based trust developed in the processes studied by Larson in ways resembling what occurred in our cases. But
there are also differences in the case situations studied: Larson's case firms
seemed to be able to rely more on reputation and the use of what we call trust
references at the start of the processes, probably because the firms existed since
before and therefore had more earlier opportunities to build trust. These
established firms also seemed to have more resources of their own at the start of
the studied process. Our contributions extend those of Larson in some respects:
In contrast to Larson we identified the dimension in what we called enterprisebased trust: the significance of trust in the product, product development, its
quality and distribution. Furthermore, Larson's study identified intermediaries as
important for reputation, but the findings did not - as did our study - encompass
the type and role variation nor the symbolic significance of persons and objects
making sense as trust carriers. We therefore conclude two things: 1) The process
oriented approach has led to findings concerning trust in action processes in
both studies, which indicates the approach to be rewarding for the future 2) The
concepts concerning new venture trust in our study may be useful as a frame of
reference for studies of business trust in general.
Sullivan et al. (1981 and 1982) studied cultural differences concerning
perception of trust between American and Japanese firms in joint ventures. They
43

The author uses the term "entrepreneurial firms" meaning adaptive and innovative in
combination with high growth, i.e. another sense than our study's new venture (cf. section
1.2.1).

<-----Page 193----->194

came to the conclusion that American and Japanese firms defined trust similarly
(i.e. its content) but raised different requirements on contractual processes in
which trust was important. Such differences will not be noticed if the processes
themselves are not studied. But our study can be seen as a qualification and
extension of these findings since we also show that the content of trust (trust
bases) in a specific relation can change as the relation changes during an action
process. Trust bases can thus be both a prerequisite for an action process to
develop and the unfolding of an action process can have an impact on the trust
content (trust base). Our study indicates interrelationships, which may be of
interest for further studies. There could be fruitful combinations for further
studies concerning business trust using experience from time-as-element and
process oriented studies, such as our study, and the results from content-of-trust
and causal relationship studies.

9. 1. 4 Methodology for Entrepreneurship Research
Among scholars there is a debate concerning the most rewarding approaches to
entrepreneurship research, and a number of them criticise what is often labelled
as mainstream entrepreneurship research. Low & Macmillan (1988, pp. 156-57)
see challenges in entrepreneurship research coping with i. a. the lack of
definitional agreements, weak theory development with too few theoretical
perspectives, focus on personality instead of social context, single instead of
multiple levels of analysis. Gartner et al. (1992, p. 21) mean that there is a lack
of theoretical lense in studying entrepreneurs' managerial activities: "We suggest
that theories on entrepreneurial behavior would benefit more from studies that
utilize a variety of data-collection methods that describe what entrepreneurs do."
In this debate one underlying problem seems to be the lack of unanimous clarity
and unity of definitions on the entrepreneur and entrepreneurship in combination
with attempts to apply methodology - to a large extent survey studies and testing
of hypotheses - requiring basic conceptual clarity. Gartner et al. (1992):
The entrepreneurship area's pursuit of "rigor" has been narrowly construed to encompass
only large sample sizes of the latest sophisticated numerical analytical techniques, rather
than openness to use other methodologies that are likely to produce significant insights
into the phenomenon" (p. 21).

This concept-building study may by its approach and type of results contribute to
the view: Entrepreneurship studies need to focus on conceptualisation and less
on verification using premature concepts.

<-----Page 194----->195

Apart from conceptual clarity Low & Macmillan (1988) also point at a
need for longitudinal data collection to comprehend complex phenomena. To
comprehend entrepreneurial processes Bygrave (1989) contends,
Entrepreneurship begins with a disjointed, discontinuous, non-linear (and usually unique)
event that cannot be studied successfully with methods developed for examining smooth,
continuous, linear (and often repeatable) processes (pp. 7-8).

Davidsson (1990, p. 7) considers longitudinal studies in entrepreneurship to be
"badly needed". Our study used a sustained study period covering important
action and events for data collection to identify sequences and timing of action
and events. Most of that data can only be collected in observation and in
interviews, i.e. on the spot. A comparatively long time span for the study
facilitated reflection, both on the part of the respondents and the researcher.
Forming concepts and patterns of sensemaking and action inferred from data
needs recurrent data collection with time in between. This experience can be
used and developed in further studies.

9. 2 Practical Implications
The Entrepreneur and New Venture
Views and concepts in this study may be an aid to focus on how to build and use
trust in specific start-up situations: In relations with different trust raters, what is
most important concerning trust? Examples of important foci concerning trust:
- the entrepreneur as a person
- competence in the field of the new venture
- the ability to run a business
- its potential or actual product
- financial resources and stability
- background of the entrepreneur
- industry experience.
These aspects may have varying importance for different actors around the
venture: Customers may trust competence or product most, suppliers financial
stability etc. It could therefore be important for the entrepreneur to concentrate
on those trust dimensions actually expressed by identified external actors and
build trust in relations with that in mind. The study also points out conditions
important for trust such as

<-----Page 195----->196

- dialogue between actors
- mutual views on benefits from interaction
- shared risks and results between parties
- the parties being complementary to each other
- identifying key products and key customers
- use of balancing parties in financing, and the
- importance of industry norms for positioning in the market
may have implications for trust in the start-up.
Furthermore, patterns of trust-building could become consciously applied
ways of action. Could the new venture find a good trust agent? What trust signs
could be valuable and how to display them? Insight into the notion of trust "spillover" effects could open ways of dealing with relations. From the start or by
learning under way the new venture could design effective trust strategies. The
examples in chapters 7 and 8 indicate some ways. One more general thing to
remember: It is not self-evident that one correctly judges others' assessment of
oneself. The different trust concepts could be an aid to remember that.

Entrepreneurial Training and Education
Entrepreneurial training courses, "start-your-own-business"-aid activities and
practically oriented books in the field normally identify contact-building as
something important for new business ventures. In discussions how to build and
use these contacts, trust is worthwhile pointing out. It is also possible to
emphasise trust and action to build trust in different case-studies, checklists and
other educational material. Particularly, looking at the growing field of
entrepreneurship in academic education, the framework and concepts from this
study could be used when describing and explaining the phenomenon of
entrepreneurship and new venture creation. In e.g. thesis writing, views and
concepts from this study could be elements used and elaborated.

Decision Making and Advice
Decision making is done by organisations which promote new ventures by rating
venture possibilities, and giving different kinds of financial or managerial
support. Swedish as well as international studies indicate that decision makers
and advisors use a combination of structured and unstructured information as a
basis for decisions and other judgements concerning each new venture. By
structured aids for information is meant check-lists, ranking methods, scoring
methods, business planning models and similar. (These issues are discussed in

<-----Page 196----->197

Scott, Gibb, Lewis & Faulkner, 1986; NUTEK, 1993; Sandberg & Hofer, 1987)
From various studies and the researcher's personal communication with new
venture advisors, unstructured information seems to be considered most
important by the raters themselves. For the same reasons as discussed above in
this section, the notion of trust could be a mental tool when decision-makers and
advisors work using unstructured information. When using check-lists, models
for judging entrepreneurial possibilities etc., the trust notion could be one means
of assessing the potential entrepreneur's contact abilities.

9. 3 Suggestions for Further Research
Generative capacity implies whether the results of a concept building study can
be used in other studies, by the same researcher or by others. Eisenhardt (1989,
p. 541) discusses theory-building in two main steps. The first step is concept
building as in this study. The second step implies that you regard concepts as
hypotheses and shape them by using a replication logic across new cases. The
aim could be increased understanding of "why" relationships, sharpened
construct definitions, insights into validity and measurability. The second step
can concern similar cases, which would be continued theory building concerning
new venture trust or it could be an orientation to build business trust theory in
different empirical settings (cf. Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The latter means to
study trust concerning other business situations than that of being a new venture.
In both orientations there are common themes to study concerning e.g. what is
the impact on trust of characteristics of the relationships where trust comes into
the play.

9. 3. 1 Theory-building Concerning New Venture
Trust
The concepts and notions in the study can be seen as a frame of reference which
is not specific just for the ventures actually studied in this study, but reflects
important phenomena in any such study. The concepts and notions themselves
can be further elaborated, refined or revised in studies to come. This study can
be seen in a chain of theory and knowledge development in the spirit of Glaser &
Strauss (1967), the constant comparative method. By such studies a deeper
understanding can be reached in two areas: 1) The role of trust in business start-

<-----Page 197----->198

up and early development, and 2) The conditions for entrepreneurship in
business start-up and early development.
This study has focused on new ventures surviving their first five years. In
these cases the entrepreneurs/new ventures and external actors have managed to
use and build trust. But in other situations trust cannot be used or built. Lack of
expectations may remain or expectations may vanish during an action process.
Business failures could be studied for the impact and consequences of lack of
trust, which would bring understanding concerning the role of trust from another
angle. Furthermore, in section 4.1.5 the notion of distrust was discussed. Distrust
implies negative expectations, e.g. denials of common norms and obligations.
External actors may impose active resistance against the new venture, even in
situations where their sensemaking trust and desirable business outcomes would
be possible. Distrust as an obstacle for new venture creation may have important
implications for entrepreneurship on different levels and deserves to be studied.

9. 3. 2 Theory-building Concerning Business Trust
This study has been focused on business start-up and early development during
the first few years after start-up. Trust-building and the use of trust may be
different after this period. A couple of studied relationships in this study indicate
that mutual trust can become more prominent. This is also in line with findings
in the industrial network studies (see e.g. Håkansson & Johanson, 1992) and
small business network studies (Johannisson, 1988). Studies in mutual trust
could also be seen as part of network studies in business, with the aim of
investigating for example ties between parties due to mutual trust.
The entrepreneur may personalise the new venture. Person-based
trustworthiness often precedes enterprise-based trustworthiness. Common values
and beliefs between actors may develop later. Development of common values
and beliefs can be seen as externalisation of an originally subjective stance of the
actors. When externalised and accepted by other actors, values and beliefs
become objectified and subsequently may become internalised in new actors in
the setting. The process of institutionalisation, discernible in the study, can be
studied using the Berger & Luckmann (1966) framework. This would provide
insight into issues like development of industries by influence from new actors
or - vice versa - how existing value systems become internalised in entrants.
So far we have looked upon trust mainly as a phenomenon pertinent to
individuals or enterprises. But the institutionalisation view opens up for trust as
a collective phenomenon: industry trust, trust in society sectors and organisations

<-----Page 198----->199

in society. The actors here are industry organisations, trade unions, authorities,
professional opinion makers and mass media. There is a need for industries and
society sectors to build and use collective trust and the different bodies are actors
for using, building or changing trust concerning themselves (cf. Berg & Jonsson,
1991). Trust here is not personal but often conveyed by persons. Reputation is
one form of collective trust. Intermediaries play an important role for collective
trust. Views and concepts from this study could be used, extended and revised in
studies on collective trust. At the same time important phenomena in society may
be brought to attention and reflection. Collective trust can be studied using our
terminology of person-based (organisation personified by e.g. its president),
enterprise-based or institution-based trust (adherence to law, norms etc.).
In the study there are examples of actors, for whom trust itself is a
business outcome. Some actors exist on the production and distribution of trust:
They invest in trust, maybe acquire a licence for providing trust and produce
trust for other's consumption. Trust becomes a commodity. In our study some
commercial and technical advisors worked as professional intermediaries
between trusters and trustees. As trust agents they used trust in themselves in the
eyes of trusters to promote trust in trustees. An example: The bank gives the new
venture credit based on assessment from Almi which is then a commercial
advisor working as a professional in trust production and distribution.44 The role
may as in the example be based on society's legitimation as trust producer
(Zucker, 1986). Whole organisations in society are dedicated to maintaining such
systems of trust legitimation ("Packaged trust", Carlman, 1993). Trust as a
commodity brings different impacts on entrepreneurship and new venture
creation, which can be studied for development of trust theory as well as its
implications for new ventures and society.

9. 3. 3 Trust and Asymmetric Relationships
The notion of equity in conjunction with trust has been discussed in the literature
(Barney & Hansen, 1994; Luhmann, 1979; Ring & van de Ven, 1992). Equity is
not in focus for this study but it has been noticed in relationships studied that
different relations vary in terms of equity as interpreted by the parties, which
may have implications for trustworthiness and mutual trust. Relations may be
made sense as asymmetric in terms of 1) dependence of one on the other (Blau,
44

Trust in business professions such as accountantcy has been studied by Barber (1983) and
stock broking by Zucker (1986).

<-----Page 199----->200

1964; Emerson 1975) 2) information asymmetry (Barney & Hansen, 1994; Ring
& van de Ven, 1992) when one party can make use of information that the other
cannot use, and 3) power one has over the other (Cook & Emerson, 1978; Pfeffer
& Salancik, 1978). The meaning of trust, the need for trust and how it is used
and built may be affected by asymmetric relationships. There is a potential to
deeper analysis in the study's collected data concerning how the entrepreneurs
made sense of trust regarding certification agencies and regulating authorities on
which they depended more than vice versa. Apart from the issue of equity and
trust, studies of equity in action processes would also provide widened
knowledge of individuals' sensemaking in action, in individual and social
construction of reality.

9. 3. 4 Entrepreneurial Symbolism
The entrepreneurs in the cases displayed a very good understanding of how to
use symbols to promote their interests in the action processes. They spotted and
used human intermediaries as well as objects conveying trust (cf. chapter 8).
They have probably also made sense of persons, companies as well as objects
conveying trust unreflectedly, even if that is more difficult to discern. Symbols
transcend the literal to represent some wider domain of meaning (Gioia, 1986, p.
52).45 In entrepreneurship literature, however, symbols seem to have attracted
very little attention, but for a few writers.46 Even if this study could give only
limited conclusions (see e.g. section 6.4.2), further studies may encounter a rich
field concerning symbolic meanings in connection with 1) entrepreneurial action,
and 2) actors, signs and events. Another area for studies could be symbolic
representation of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship itself, its meanings to
entrepreneurs, other groups, or in society as a whole. Our new ventures have
been commented in local newspapers in ways that imply symbolic meaning for
progress and hope in a wider sense than merely pertaining to the ventures
themselves. Different conceptions in newspapers and popular management
45

A symbol is something that stands for something else by reason of relationship, association,
convention, or accidental resemblance (The Merriam-Webster Dictionary). This definition is
one of the more precise; the notion of symbol has in recent years become rather wide, denoting
e.g. that all human understanding is essentially symbolic in nature. Gioia (1986, p. 52)
comments on such wide definitions as "so encompassing that they tend to preclude a definition
of what is not a symbol, thus limiting the concept for organizational analysis".
46 Bird (1992) was quoted in section 1.1 for her notion of "Symbolic Marker Events". Events
like writing a business plan, signing a lease, sales to the first customer take on symbolic
meaning. Johannisson (e.g. 1992) introduces metaphors for understanding entrepreneurship and
entrepreneurial behaviour.

<-----Page 200----->201

magazines implying "entrepreneurs as saviours from unemployment" and similar
ideas indicate richness in symbolic meanings. Benefits from studies in
entrepreneurial symbolism could be increased understanding concerning
viability of entrepreneurial action and the role and conditions for entrepreneurship in general.

Förtroende mellan entreprenörer och externa
aktörer - sammanfattning
Förtroendets roll och funktion för nya företag
Förtroendets betydelse för nya företag har diskuterats i litteraturen. Några
författare ser förtroendet hos det nya företagets omgivning (kunder, leverantörer,
finansiärer m fl) som avgörande för att företaget ska lyckas att etablera sig (Bird,
1992; Birley & Norburn, 1985; Diffenbach & Higgins, 1987; Macmillan, 1983).
Emellertid fördjupar inte tidigare studier diskussionerna till att empiriskt
undersöka förtroendets roll och funktion för det nya företaget. Denna studie har
därför som övergripande syfte att ge ett bidrag till kunskaperna om förtroendets
roll och funktion vid företags start och tidig utveckling. Start och tidig utveckling
av nya företag ses i studien som handlingsprocesser i vilka entreprenörer och
externa aktörer deltar. Förtroende ses som mening/uppfattning vilken de olika
aktörerna tilldelar handlandet.
Studien avser att genom begreppsbildning bidra till teori rörande
entreprenörskap. Detta övergripande syfte utgör grund för tre specifika
forskningsfrågor. Den första forskningsfrågan gäller: Vilka är externa aktörers
grunder till förtroende för entreprenörer och nya företag? Förtroende ses som
ett komplext och mångfacetterat fenomen . Förtroende hos aktörerna är en
individuellt och socialt konstruerad mening/uppfattning. Insikter om dessa
meningskonstruktioner kräver bl a ett språk, en taxonomi, rörande grunder för
aktörers förtroende i och för fortsatt analys.
Förtroende mellan två aktörer kan förändras över tiden beroende på
handling och aktörernas tolkning av handlingarnas konsekvenser. Aktörers egen
trovärdighet är betydelsefull men skapas hos andra aktörer. Därför måste aktören
handla med utgångspunkt från en uppfattning om sin trovärdighet hos viktiga
andra aktörer. Den andra forskningsfrågan blir då: Hur utnyttjar och bygger
entreprenörer förtroende i handlingsprocesser?
Behov av förtroende kan medföra komplexa mönster för utnyttjande och
uppbyggnad av förtroende. Mellanhänder kan ha en roll i att förmedla
förtroende. Den tredje forskningsfrågan blir därvid: Utnyttjar entreprenörer och
externa aktörer regelbundet mellanhänder i handlingsprocesser för uppbyggnad
och bedömningar av förtroende?

<-----Page 203----->204

Företagsstart och företagets tidiga utveckling ses som en oviss (eng.
equivocal) situation i aktörernas ögon (Gartner, Bird & Starr, 1992; Starr &
Macmillan, 1983; Weick, 1979). Ovisshet gäller marknad, där det nya företaget
kan vara okänt och ha ett underläge visavi etablerade konkurrenter (Vesper,
1990). Vidare kan ovisshet också gälla kapitalanskaffning, i de fall
entreprenörernas egna kapital inte är tillräckligt. Det nya företaget kan ha en
svag position på lånemarknaden, beroende på att det har få säkerheter att erbjuda
och ytterst att det inte har historiska data att uppvisa angående lönsamhet och
andra finansiella nyckeltal (Ang, 1991). Slutligen kan ovisshet finnas i själva
relationerna till andra aktörer: Roller som inte är etablerade, ömsesidig förståelse
som är outvecklad, och att stabila rutiner för leveranser av t ex service saknas
(Stinchcombe, 1965). Alla dessa ovissheter varierar beroende på
omständigheterna i varje specifikt fall (Gartner, 1985). Det är dock meningsfullt
för entreprenören och externa aktörer att söka minska ovisshet. Ett sätt är att
utnyttja och/eller bygga förtroende.

Entreprenör och entreprenörskap
Begreppet entreprenör har länge funnits i ekonomisk litteratur. Entreprenörskap
har länge förknippats med rollen att genom utbud och efterfrågan skapa jämvikt
på marknaden (Peterson, 1981; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990). Schumpeter (1934)
bröt mot denna tradition i och med att han definierade entreprenören som den
som omkombinerar produktionsfaktorer genom innovation och därigenom
skapar en förflyttning från en jämvikt till en annan. Kirzner (1973) såg
entreprenören som den som utnyttjar vinstmöjligheter genom detaljerad
kännedom om marknaden och dess aktörer. Enligt Kirzner står handlandet i
fokus: Aktörerna lär sig av erfarenhet och anpassar sitt handlande i enlighet
därmed.
Under senare tid har en mängd olika synsätt på entreprenör och
entreprenörskap vuxit fram beroende på olika forskares disciplinbakgrund,
referensramar och forskningsintressen. Begreppen entreprenör och
entreprenörskap har betecknats som obestämbara och gäckande för analys (t ex
Baumol, 1968). Då är det viktigt att studier på ämnesområdet diskuterar tänkbara
synsätt, lägger fast ett synsätt vars innebörd för studierna klarläggs. Detta sker i
denna studie som en genomgång av teoribildningen och klassificering av
entreprenör och entreprenörskap i fem olika perspektiv:
- ett samhällsperspektiv
- ett perspektiv med företag grupperade, t ex i bransch
- ett företagsperspektiv

<-----Page 204----->205

- ett individperspektiv
- ett perspektiv med individ i kontext.
Perspektivet med individ i kontext är ett synsätt i vilket uppmärksammas
samspel mellan entreprenören och andra aktörer i handlingsprocesser. Detta
medger studier av förtroendeutnyttjande och -uppbyggnad i handling över tiden.
Begreppet entreprenör definieras som grundare-ägare-ledare till ett nystartat
företag och bärare av tre engagemang, vilka samtidigt ska vara karaktäristiska för
personen: Startengagemang, ägarengagemang och arbetsengagemang. Kontext är
den del av omvärlden som en aktör ser som meningsfull för handlande vid någon
specifik tidpunkt. Externa aktörer bestäms därvid genom entreprenörens kontext.

Handlingsprocesser och meningsskapande
Företags start och tidiga utveckling ses i studien som organisering genom
handlingsprocesser mellan entreprenör och externa aktörer (Gartner, 1985;
Weick, 1979). Handlingsprocesser innebär att handling av en person väcker
någon specifik respons från en annan, varvid den första personen ger ny respons,
osv. Varje person har en uppfattning om meningsfullt resultat (eng. outcome) av
sitt handlande, något som styr handlandet (Gioia, 1986; Weick, 1995). Aktörer
involverar andra aktörer i handling i vilken var och en uppfattar egna eller
gemensamma resultat. Denna syn på resultat medför också att vad personer
uppfattar som resultat förändras över tiden och att resultatuppfattning anpassas
till handlings- och händelseutveckling. Dessutom tilldelar aktörer sitt handlande
mening även retrospektivt, dvs konstruerar motiv i efterskott.
Ovisshet finns samtidigt med överflöd av sådan information som kan
utgöra grund för meningsfullt uppfattade resultat. Det centrala begreppet
meningsskapande (eng. sensemaking; Thomas, Clark & Gioia, 1993; Weick,
1995) i studien står för att människor utmejslar meningsfullt handlande genom:
1) Grundläggande värderingar (basic values) och trosföreställningar (beliefs),
vilka är stabila över tiden (Schein, 1992). 2) Tolkningsscheman (interpretive
schemes) som bygger på individens erfarenheter från tidigare handling. 3)
Ledtrådar till vad av den överflödiga informationen individen uppmärksammar
som grund för handling. Tolkningsscheman är strukturerade uppsättningar av
synsätt och mönster av händelser/handling som kan ge mening åt fortsatt
handlande (Lord & Foti, 1986). Medvetet eller omedvetet tenderar därvid
personer att handla enligt tidigare mönster, vilka dock kan utvecklas och
förändras.
Entreprenören befinner sig i en motsägelsefull situation.
Meningsskapande är både individuellt och socialt. Andra aktörer blir en

<-----Page 205----->206

väsentlig del i entreprenörens handlande, samtidigt som entreprenören kan vara
eller vilja se sig själv som ett komplement till kontextens traditionella syn- och
handlingssätt (Johannisson, 1992). Dessutom möter entreprenören samtidigt i
kontexten aktörer med skilda föreställningar om mening och resultat. Tre sådana
kontextkategorier identifieras: den kommersiella (affärsutbyten), den institutionella (normerande) resp den personliga (släkt- och vänskapsband).
Entreprenörens kommunikation med externa aktörer i de olika kontextkategorierna kan påverkas av föreställningar i och om kontextkategori.
Entreprenören måste i samspel kunna hantera alla. Dessutom skapar
entreprenören själv sin kontext genom meningstilldelad handling och påverkar
därmed de yttre gränserna för företagandet (Czarniawska-Joerges, 1994).
Symboler kan utgöra ett medel att kommunicera mening (Gioia, 1986).
Mening och handling i processer kan utvecklas genom olika typer av
förstärkning och t ex bli goda och onda cirklar som främjar eller hindrar det nya
företaget. Det finns stor variationsrikedom i vad som kan vara mening i
handlingsprocesser vid organisering av nya företag. Förtroende är en sådan
mening.

Förtroende
Förtroende kan uttydas som tilltro till egenskaper, förmåga, styrka eller
tillförlitlighet hos någon eller något. Begrepp och innebörd i förtroende har
studerats inom många akademiska ämnen (översikt i Hosmer, 1995).
Förväntningar är ett vanligt tema i litteraturen, ofta, men ej alltid, ställd mot risk.
Efter en diskussion av förtroendebegreppets behandling hos ett antal centrala
författare inom främst sociologi och ekonomi utvecklas ett synsätt och ett antal
begrepp att utnyttja i studien. Förväntningar är en väsentlig beståndsdel i förtroende. Förväntningar mellan parter innefattar ömsesidighet, nytta för bägge
parter, rättvisa och rimlig fördelning i deras utbyten (Barber, 1983; Blau, 1964;
Luhmann, 1979; Ring & van de Ven, 1992; Zucker, 1986). Begreppet ömsesidigt
förtroende avser en uppsättning förväntningar som delas av aktörer involverade
i interaktion. Trovärdighet rör en parts förväntningar på den andra: En
uppsättning förväntningar avseende en aktör i en annan aktörs ögon. I begreppet
anseende (reputation) ligger vad som i vida kretsar sägs eller anses om en persons eller ett föremåls egenskaper, förmåga, styrka eller tillförlitlighet. Anseende
för in en tredje part, vars funktion är att överbrygga förtroende mellan de två
parterna, dvs den som bedömer och den som blir bedömd.
Förtroende i handlingsprocesser diskuteras i studien med utgångspunkt i
frågans behandling i litteraturen. Teman i litteraturen gäller förtroendets

<-----Page 206----->207

betydelse i ekonomiska transaktioner, vidare hur förtroende antas utvecklas i
sociala relationer på kort sikt och över tiden, slutligen hur ömsesidighet i
förtroende antas kunna utvecklas i långvariga relationer. Det finns olika
indikationer på ett samspel mellan förtroende och handlingsprocesser (Arrow,
1973, 1974; Blau, 1964; Håkansson, 1982; Koenig, 1985; Luhmann, 1979;
Perrow, 1986; Zucker, 1986).
Förtroende som meningsskapande föreställning diskuteras på så sätt att
olika litteraturteman kopplas till studiens referensram med grundläggande värden
och trosföreställningar, tolkningsscheman och styrt uppmärksammande av
information. Grundläggande värden och trosföreställningar diskuteras inom
förtroendelitteraturen. Teman avser föreställningar om dels förpliktelser och
moralisk ordning som grundval för förväntningar, dels ärlighet och heder och
dels ömsesidighet i utfästelser (t ex Barber, 1983; Moorman, Deshpandé &
Zaltman, 1993; Zucker, 1986). Ifråga om tolkningsscheman förs i litteratur om
förtroende likartade diskussioner kring dels förväntningscheman, dels
generaliserade föreställningar om professioner dels också sociala och
ekonomiska styrmekanismer (t ex Barber, 1983; Barney & Hansen, 1994;
Luhmann, 1979; Zucker, 1986). Styrmekanismer avser här sådana som hindrar
att opportunistiskt beteende bryter mot värden, principer och beteendestandard.
Slutligen finns ett tema innefattande att människan lever i en komplex värld där
förtroende är ett sätt att reducera komplexitet (främst Gambetta, 1986; Luhmann,
1979). Detta utgör sålunda ett helt parallellt synsätt till studiens referensram
kring att söka ledtrådar till begränsad information för handling. Slutsats för
studiens referensram blir då att förtroende kan vara meningsskapande
föreställning.
En fråga uppstår därmed: Vilka ledtrådar finns till förtroende som
meningsskapande föreställning? Eller annorlunda uttryckt: Den som bedömer en
annan persons trovärdighet, vad grundar sig bedömningen på? Utifrån
litteraturgenomgångarna beträffande entreprenörskap och förtroende kan studien
ställa en uppsättning begrepp som utnyttjas för informationsinsamling och analys
i den empiriska undersökningen. Aktörer kan se förtroende som mening kopplat
till ledtrådarna person, företag och institutionaliserad miljö. Förtroende kan vara
personbaserat, företagsbaserat och/eller institutionellt baserat.

Metodfrågor
En grundläggande metodologisk föreställning inför studien är att teoribyggande
kan ske på empirisk grund genom ackumulation av tolkad information från det
beforskade området. Teoribyggandet genomgår en process innefattande att pröva

<-----Page 207----->208

och vidareutveckla begrepp ur tidigare litteratur samt att skapa begrepp induktivt
ur insamlad och tolkad information. Genom antaganden prövas sedan relationer
mellan begreppen varvid modeller och teorier ställs upp (Lincoln & Guba, 1985;
Miles & Huberman, 1994). Studien avser att mot empiri pröva begrepp ur
hittillsvarande teoretiska referensram och att denna prövning leder till
vidareutvecklade eller nya begrepp.
Från denna utgångspunkt blir fallstudier lämplig undersökningsuppläggning (Yin, 1989). Eftersom handlingsprocesser är studieobjekt
måste fallen studeras över tiden. Fallstudien blir därmed longitudinell. Den
täcker cirka 5 år från start av företag och framåt. Då själva studiens tidslängd
avsågs bli kortare, skedde den delvis retrospektivt, delvis simultant. För
datainsamling utnyttjades främst intervjuer. Datareduktion, tolkning och analys
bygger på kodning av huvudsakligen kvalitativa data, där kodstruktur återspeglar
valda begrepp och successivt begreppsbyggande (Miles & Huberman, 1994). I
detta arbete har forskaren delvis utnyttjat ett specialinriktat datorprogram för
teoribyggande med kvalitativ information.
I en förstudie ingick sex företag som vid studiens start varit verksamma 24 år. Genom en intervju per företag insamlades information om entreprenören,
företagsidén, handlingsprocesser före start, efter formell start, förväntningar för
nära framtid och för längre tid. Efter analyser av förstudiedata valde forskaren att
studera förtroende. Sedan utvecklade forskaren ett första kodningsschema och
valde två företag ur förstudien för huvudstudien. Det ena företaget, i denna
rapport kallat Explosive, utsågs på grundval av att vara kunskapsintensivt, främst
präglat av innovativ teknisk konsultverksamhet gentemot ett litet antal
industriella kunder vilka hade krav på kundanpassade lösningar. Det andra
företaget, kallat Plastics, är ett tillverkningsföretag som producerar varor i serier
till många, men samtidigt kvalitetskrävande industriella kunder.
Sammansättningen avsåg ge tillräcklig bredd för att studera förtroende för de
begreppsbyggande syftena (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Forskaren följde företagen
genom återkommande intervjuer och studier av dokumentation. Intervjuerna gick
ut på att kartlägga handlingsprocesser med externa aktörer samt entreprenörernas
meningsuppfattningar rörande sitt och externa aktörernas handlande i
processerna. Ett successivt tillkommande syfte var att delge respondenterna
preliminära tolkningar av den tidigare insamlade informationen och att därvid få
deras uppfattning om riktighet och rimlighet i gjorda tolkningar. Vissa korskontroller av insamlad information ingick dessutom. Intervjuerna bandades,
transkriberades och introducerades i analysprogrammet.
Externa aktörer till de två företagen intervjuades också: Tre kunder med
olika slags krav och förväntningar, en råvaruleverantör, en finansiär samt en

<-----Page 208----->209

nyföretagsrådgivare. Oberoende av entreprenören gav de sin syn på olika
handlingsförlopp och mening/ innebörd i dessa. Deras allmänna föreställningar
om företroende och trovärdighet hos nyföretagare tog forskaren också upp. Viss
korskontroll av sakuppgifter kunde också ske.
Tolknings- och analysförloppet kan sammanfattas så här: Med
utgångspunkt i kodningsschema som byggdes på forskningsfrågorna och den
litteraturbaserade referensramen, gjorde forskaren successiva analyser på tre
nivåer. På en deskriptiv nivå kartlades handlingsprocesser med handling,
händelser och aktörer. På en tolkningsnivå identifierades meningsskapande
föreställningar, särskilt förtroende och trovärdighet. Slutligen, på
mönsteridentifierande nivå, studerades begreppsinnehåll, sammanhang samt
mönster i handlingsprocesser och meningsskapande.

Grunder för aktörers meningskonstruktion om förtroende
Analys gjordes som svarade upp mot den första forskningsfrågan: Vilka är
externa aktörers grunder till förtroende för entreprenörer och nya företag?
Begreppen personbaserat, företagsbaserat och institutionellt baserat förtroende
ställde forskaren mot intervjudata för att finna bekräftelser, motsägelser,
nyansering eller utvidgning. Resultaten bildar innehållsdimensioner till
respektive begrepp återspeglande tolkningar av data.
Personbaserat förtroende hos externa aktörer för entreprenörer avser
deras personliga karaktäristika, såsom motivation, självförtroende, ärlighet och
hederlighet i framträdandet. Om betydelsen av dessa karaktäristika hade
intervjuade externa aktörerna alltid bestämda uppfattningar och de syntes mycket
snabbt bilda uppfattningar, så redan vid den första kontakten med entreprenören.
Entreprenörers kompetens och erfarenhet var betydelsefulla bl a på så sätt att när
förtroende för kompetens och erfarenhet fanns, kunde entreprenörerna få stort
inflytande och genomslag för sina idéer till nya produkter och gemensam
utvecklingssatsning. Entreprenörers företagsledande och kommersiella kapacitet
bedömdes i vissa fall inte vara självklar för de nya företagarna utan förtroende
växte fram som en följd av iakttagelser av deras handlande. Bl a utsattes de för
medvetna prov. Att entreprenörerna visade en öppen attityd och gav klara och
raka svar på ställda frågor synes vara en viktig del av de externa aktörernas
bedömningar. I gengäld upplevde de också viktigt att få entreprenörens
förtroende tillbaka i dialogen, ömsesidighet.
Företagsbaserat förtroende avser externa aktörers förtroende för det nya
företaget som organisation, dess produkter, produktkvalitet, leveranskapacitet
och kapacitet för produktutveckling. Vidare finns förtroende för finansiella

<-----Page 209----->210

resurser och finansiell stabilitet som en dimension. Förtroendet för det nya
företaget som organisation var för aktörerna nära kopplat till deras syn på det nya
företagets roll på marknaden och i branschen. Att företaget kan erbjuda något
som kompletterar branschutbudet och gärna kan erbjuda något nytt var för vissa
aktörer en källa till företroende. Andra såg det i stället som förtroendeskapande
att det nya företaget höll sig till traditionella sätt att verka i branschen.
Förtroendet för det nya företagets produkter byggde i stor utsträckning på
successiva prov och testförfaranden, såsom tekniska funktionstester, kontroller
med nästa led (dvs med köparnas egna kunder), leveranstester avseende tid,
kvantitet och kvalitet. Dessutom tillämpades tester som utvisade hur företaget
klarade av oväntade eller brådskande order. Förtroende för företaget som
produktutvecklare var mycket knutet till entreprenörens kompetens och en väl
fungerande dialog. Att ge kredit och lån, finansiering, till det nya företaget
upplevs givetvis medföra risker. Dessa måste motbalanseras av bl a förtroende,
något som förutom sedvanliga kreditprövningar mycket sammanhängde med ett
förtroende uppbyggt i andra dimensioner: ärlighet, kompetens, punktlighet i
tidigare betalningar samt, inte minst, en väl fungerande dialog. Att entreprenörer
klarar finansiering genom uppbackning från flera håll, dvs verkar för
riskspridning, angavs som förtroendeskapande. En liknande förtroendeskapande
föreställning hos de externa aktörerna var entreprenörers förmåga att skapa
uppgörelser med vinst- och riskspridning i samband med produkt- och
marknadsutveckling.
Institutionellt baserat förtroende avser att entreprenörer lever upp till
lagar och normer, allmänna värderingar och traditioner. Ofta avsåg de externa
aktörerna i intervjuerna normer, värderingar och traditioner i den egna branschen
eller den egna koncernen. Entreprenörerna själva såg den juridiska formen på
företagandet (aktiebolag) viktig för att skapa förtroende hos de externa aktörerna.
Detta innefattade i ett fall att visa upp att en välkänd - men samtidigt dyr revisionsfirma anlitades. De externa aktörerna syntes närmast ta
aktiebolagsformen med dess kontrollmöjligheter, revision och årsredovisning,
som givna i den industriella miljö där entreprenörerna verkade. Symboler för att
vara etablerade, såsom organisationsnummer, logotyper mm, lade
entreprenörerna i början av sin verksamhet stor vikt vid. De externa aktörerna, av
vilka de flesta ingick i stora koncerner, lade mer eller mindre automatiskt vikt
vid att de nya företagen följde avtalsnormer och liknande som var typiska för
dessa stora koncerners egen verksamhet. För bägge de nya företagen var normer
för verksamheten i form av tillstånd av myndigheter, produktcertifikat mm
betydelsefulla och i viss mån tvingande. Bägge lade stor vikt vid att skaffa även
ej tvingande tillstånd och certifikat för trovärdighet på marknaden. De sågs som

<-----Page 210----->211

en konkurrensfaktor och affärsutveckling inriktades på att ligga före
konkurrenterna i dessa avseenden. Betydelsen ur trovärdighetssynpunkt att
kunna visa upp kompetens och bra produkter via tillstånd och certifikat
bekräftades i rikt mått av de externa aktörerna. De tillmätte sådan verifierad
kompetens stor vikt för att olika relationer utvecklats och resultat uppnåtts. Vissa
externa aktörer utnyttjade reglerna för sina egna ISO 9000-certifikat till att göra
inspektioner hos företagen. Om förväntningarna vid dessa inte skulle ha
uppfyllts (vilket de gjorde) så hade trovärdigheten snabbt kunna förbrukas. Att
allmänna värderingar är gemensamma mellan extern aktör och entreprenör
betonades som viktigt för förtroendet av framför allt de aktörer som hade
långvariga relationer med entreprenören. Traditioners betydelse för förtroende
kom in vissa aktörers intervjuer. Det handlade då om att entreprenören själv eller
genom familj och släkt sedan länge funnits i branschen.
En allmän slutsats från analysen av de studerade situationerna är att
förtroende kan dels vara en förbetingelse för handling, dels ett resultat av
genomförd handling. Förtroende syntes kunna påverkas av handling.

Förtroendeutveckling i handlingsprocesser
Andra forskningsfrågan lyder: Hur utnyttjar och bygger entreprenörer
förtroende i handlingsprocesser? Följande synsätt och begreppsapparat
användes och utvecklades i analysen. I handlingsprocesser kan entreprenörer
utnyttja trovärdighet, som entreprenören anser finnas i en extern aktörs ögon
såsom förbetingelse för en handlingsprocess. Entreprenören kan också bygga
trovärdighet, om entreprenören anser befintlig trovärdighet vara otillräcklig i en
extern aktörs ögon såsom förbetingelse för en handlingsprocess. Trovärdighet
ses som meningsfull i entreprenörens ögon i förhållande till önskat resultat, som t
ex kan vara att skaffa externt kapital, få ökad omsättning genom marknadsföringsåtgärd etc. Entreprenören kan då välja att handla med uppfattning om
att trovärdighet kan utnyttjas för att nå resultat, men också bedöma resultatet
svårt att uppnå och kräva förberedelse i form av uppbyggnad av trovärdighet.
Trovärdighet skulle därigenom kunna ha mening inte enbart för affärsresultat
utan även för att utveckla relationen mellan parterna och därmed förbättra
betingelserna för framtida affärsresultat.
Studien har analyserat sex relationer över tiden mellan huvudstudiens två
fallföretag och externa aktörer (kunder, råvaruleverantör, finansiär,
företagsstartrådgivare) för att se om och hur entreprenörer utnyttjade och byggde
trovärdighet gentemot externa aktörer. För varje relation beskrivs i studien
kartlagd handlingsprocess över tiden, huvudsakliga förväntade resultat,

<-----Page 211----->212

förtroendesituationen vid det nya företagets start, utnyttjad och byggd
trovärdighet över tiden, trovärdighet som interaktion resulterat i samt
konsekvenser för ömsesidigt förtroende.
Analysen av de sex relationerna ger ett antal slutsatser och indicerar vissa
mönster till utveckling av förtroende. Slutsatserna är 1) Trovärdighet kan byggas
även om ingen sådan existerade vid företagets start 2) Institutionellt baserad
trovärdighet var betydelsefullt vid företagets start eller kunde byggas upp genom
utveckling av gemensamma normer och värderingar under handlingsprocessen 3)
Personbaserad trovärdighet utvecklades tidigt genom direkta kontakter med
externa aktörer 4) Företagsbaserad trovärdighet utvecklades efter personbaserad
och eventuell befintlig institutionellt baserad trovärdighet. Detta antyder följande
mönster i förtroendeutveckling:
A) Personbaserat förtroende kan vara meningsföreställning utifrån vilken
företagsbaserat förtroende kan utvecklas,
B) En kombination av institutionellt baserat och personbaserat förtroende kan
vara meningsföreställning utifrån vilken företagsbaserat förtroende kan
utvecklas,
C) Personbaserat förtroende i kombination med företagsbaserat förtroende kan
vara meningsföreställning för utveckling av institutionellt baserat förtroende
under handlingsprocessens gång.
Vidare kan ytterligare ett mönster urskiljas i data hur trovärdigheten byggdes:
Sekvenser av handling under processers gång uppvisade ofta en växling mellan
utnyttjande och byggande av trovärdighet från en handling till nästa handling i
sekvensen. Denna växling kunde då avse samma trovärdighetsbas, t ex att bygga
personbaserad trovärdighet för att utnyttja den in nästa handling, eller en växling
i trovärdighetsbas, t ex utnyttja personbaserad trovärdighet för att bygga
företagsbaserad trovärdighet.
Analyserna ovan bygger på en aktörs meningsföreställningar om
trovärdighet hos den andre. Många situationer präglas av reciprocitet, dvs
uppbyggnad av trovärdighet beträffande entreprenör hos extern aktör influeras
av den omvända trovärdighetsuppbyggnaden hos entreprenören beträffande den
externa aktören. Det insamlade materialet ger indikationer på den reciproka
trovärdighetsuppbyggnadens karaktär. Denna kan sammanfattas i en
sammanhängande sekvens i sex steg gällande två aktörers (A och B) reciproka
trovärdighetsuppbyggnad enligt följande:
1) A ser förtroende som mening i handling som innefattar B
2) A handlar visavi B
3) B uppfattar A's handling och tolkar dess trovärdighetsmening för B's egen del
4) B handlar visavi A

<-----Page 212----->213

5) A uppfattar B's handling och tolkar dess trovärdighetsmening för A's egen del
6) ömsesidig reflektion, dvs rekonstruktion av respektive aktörs trovärdighetsföreställningar. Denna rekonstruktion kan eventuellt påverka
tolkningsscheman. Reflektion kan möjligen även ha konsekvenser för aktörernas
värderingar och deras grundläggande trosföreställningar.
Handlingsprocessen kan fortsätta i en ny sexstegssekvens. Två element har
identifierats jämfört med föregående analys. 1) Handling av den ene leder till
uppmärksamhet och prövande av mening hos den andre. 2) Reflektion över
handling sker hos bägge aktörerna individuellt eller gemensamt och leder till
konsekvenser för fortsatt meningskonstruktion rörande förtroende. Utveckling av
förtroende kan beskrivas som flera kopplade sekvenser i en handlingsprocess,
där meningsföreställningar kan konvergera eller divergera. Konvergerande
meningsföreställningar om trovärdighet är utveckling av förtroende. Utveckling
av reciproka meningsföreställningar kan anta mönster såsom självuppfyllande
profetior samt goda och onda cirklar. Här kan utvecklingen studeras med
sexstegsekvensen som modell.

Förtroendeförmedlare i handlingsprocesser
Handlingsprocesser kan innefatta förmedlare av förtroende mellan två aktörer:
Person, grupp av personer, organisation eller föremål kan symbolisera
förtroende. Första steget i den fortsatta analysen gällde vilka mellanhänder
entreprenörer uppfattar för förtroende och trovärdighet i handlingsprocesser,
andra steget gällde den tredje forskningsfrågan: Utnyttjar entreprenörer och
externa aktörer regelbundet förmedlare i handlingsprocesser för uppbyggnad
och bedömningar av förtroende?
I studien framkom att entreprenörerna i många situationer byggde
trovärdighet hos extern aktör genom att bygga eller utnyttja trovärdighet hos
förmedlare, vilken entreprenören föreställde sig ha trovärdighet i den externa
aktörens ögon. Från intervjuerna med såväl entreprenörerna som deras externa
aktörer framträdde en grundläggande föreställning bakom utnyttjande av
förmedlare. Entreprenören tillskriver förmedlare trovärdighet i den externa aktörens ögon. Förmedlarens trovärdighet i den externa aktörens ögon antas av
entreprenören "spilla över" på entreprenören själv, som därvid får sin
uppbyggnad av trovärdighet hos den externa aktören underlättad. Förmedlarens
roll är sålunda att aktivt eller passivt förmedla trovärdighet för entreprenören.
Observerade förmedlare har utöver aktiv eller passiv roll grupperats i typ av
förmedlare: Människa eller föremål. Därvid uppstår tre möjliga kombinationer:
Passiv resp aktiv människa och objekt (alltid passivt).

<-----Page 213----->214

Passiv förmedling av trovärdighet via en person eller organisation är att ha
roll som i studien kallas trovärdighetsreferens. Entreprenören hänvisar till
referensen som är passiv, dvs inte gör någon egen insats för entreprenörens
trovärdighet. Referensen har egen trovärdighet i den externa aktörens ögon och
uppfattas av denne att kunna bedöma entreprenören. Exempel är när entreprenör
framhåller inför en ny kund att man levererar till ett välkänt företag.
Aktiv förmedling av trovärdighet via en person eller organisation är att
utöva roll som kallas trovärdighetsagent. Denne gör någon form av aktiv
handling för att främja entreprenörens trovärdighet i den externa aktörens ögon.
Ett exempel är när företagsstartrådgivare hos banken bistår entreprenör med
bedömningsunderlag i entreprenörens kreditförhandling med banken.
Passiv förmedling av trovärdighet via objekt som symboliserar
trovärdighet för entreprenör i den externa aktörens ögon är den tredje formen av
förmedling. Exempel på sådana materiella objekt iakttagna i studien är
dokument, såsom bolagsregistreringsbevis, produktcertifikat, patenthandlingar,
diplom och årsredovisning. Immateriella motsvarigheter är titlar som teknologie
doktor, civilingenjör och identitetsangivelser som organisationsnummer,
leverantörsnummer.
Förmedlare kan alltså tillskrivas symbolisk mening med avseende på
trovärdighet och förtroende. Om entreprenörer utnyttjar förmedlare på visst sätt
är detta en del av entreprenörens tolkningsschema för hur förtroende utnyttjas
och byggs. Dessa tolkningscheman kan ha olika karaktäristika: Entreprenören
kan tillämpa dess mönster medvetet eller omedvetet. Mönstren kan vara enkla
eller komplexa, dvs att alltid bygga trovärdighet på samma sätt eller att tillämpa
variation. Slutligen kan det finnas variation i vilken omfattning mönstren
upprepas. Studien myntar begreppet förtroendestrategi för tolkningsschema
innefattande mönster eller kopplad sekvens av handling som entreprenören/det
nya företaget tillskriver trovärdighetsmening för att främja ett resultat. Studien
undersöker sådana tolkningsscheman innefattande förtroende som mening och
som tillämpas medvetet av entreprenör. Studien fann enkla förtroendestrategier,
där entreprenören upprepat utnyttjade i likartade situationer antingen
trovärdighetsagent, trovärdighetsreferens eller trovärdighetsobjekt. Studien fann
också exempel på komplexa förtroendestrategier, i vilka entreprenören utnyttjade
en kedja av handlingar i en process, innefattande olika slags förmedlare av
trovärdighet som tillskrevs olika mening beträffande trovärdighet i olika lägen
under processen. De komplexa förtroendestrategierna verkade utformas speciellt
för varje tillfälle, återspeglande att situationerna under handlingsprocesserna
varierade. En del tolkningscheman karaktäriserades av mer automatisk

<-----Page 214----->215

tillämpning utan förändring vid tillämpning, andra påverkas troligtvis mer vid
tillämpning.

Slutsatser av studien
Studiens teoretiska bidrag är att utifrån dess begreppsbyggande syfte på empirisk
grund ha skapat en taxonomi kring trovärdighet och förtroende för entreprenörer
och nya företag. I samband med detta utvecklar studien också ett
processorienterat synsätt och metodologi för studier av entreprenörskap i sin
kontext. Men resultaten kan ha teoretiska bidrag även i övrigt. Studier kring
förtroende i företagsekonomiska studier med andra studieobjekt kan dra nytta av
resultaten för att ställa upp referensramar. Det gäller dels begrepp som
institutionellt baserat, personbaserat resp företagsbaserat förtroende, dels
tillvägagångssättet att studera förtroende i och genom handlingsprocesser samt
dels synsätt och begrepp kring roller som förtroendeförmedlare. Slutligen utgör
studien ett exempel på hur Weick's (1979, 1995) och Gioia's (1986) syn på
meningsskapande handling kan tillämpas i en empirisk studie.
Slutsatser för praktiskt utnyttjande finns i studerade handlingsprocesser
där företagare, utbildare och företagsrådgivare kan hitta exempel på betydelse av
trovärdighet och förtroende för nya företag. Idéer kan också hämtas till praktisk
hantering av trovärdighet och förtroende i olika situationer.
Förslag till fortsatt forskning gäller några olika områden enligt följande.
Förtroende för nya företag förtjänar studeras i fler liknande fall, då det finns
potential för ytterligare slutsatser med större material än denna studie har kunnat
inrymma. Dessutom bör "negativa fall", dvs startmisslyckanden samt fall som
drabbats av externa aktörers misstro vara värda studeras för att öka kunskaperna
om hinder för nyföretagande. Vidare bör studier göras som från företagsstart
sträcker sig längre fram i tiden än vad som här har varit möjligt. Då kan
ömsesidighet i förtroende mera ingående studeras, bl a kan så ske genom att
denna studies taxonomi kopplas samman med nätverkssynsätt som referensram
(Håkansson & Johanson, 1992; Johannisson, 1988). Förtroendets roll i
institutionaliseringsprocesser (Berger & Luckmann, 1966) kan också studeras
under längre tidsrymd, varvid t ex nyföretagares roll för branschutveckling kan
fokuseras. Förtroende är även ett kollektivt fenomen och taxonomin kan ha
relevans för att studera problem kring förtroende för samhällssektorer och
branscher i näringslivet. Förmedlarrollen finns även här och kommer att bl a
gälla anseende (reputation). I asymmetriska relationer, dvs sådana där makt är
ojämnt fördelad eller en part har informationsövertag, får förtroende speciella
konsekvenser, vilket denna studie ger vissa indikationer om. Detta kan studeras

<-----Page 215----->216

med mera empiriskt material. Slutligen har denna studie berört symboler och
symbolföreställningar. Studien innehåller vissa exempel på olika
symbolföreställningar om entreprenörer och entreprenörskap, med vidare
konsekvenser än enbart förtroende mellan aktörer. Sålunda förknippas
entreprenör och entreprenörskap med varierande föreställningar om roll och
betydelse för samhället. Sådana föreställningar kan ibland präglas av rikedom i
symbolisk innebörd, såsom: "Entreprenörskap som räddning mot arbetslöshet"
Om symbolföreställningar kring entreprenör och entreprenörskap synes än så
länge finnas mycket liten forskning.
