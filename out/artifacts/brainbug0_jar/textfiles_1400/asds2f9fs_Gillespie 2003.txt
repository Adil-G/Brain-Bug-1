<-----Page 1----->Abstract
This study describes the development and validation of the Behavioral Trust Inventory (BTI).
The BTI measures the willingness to be vulnerable in work relationships. The development
and validity of the BTI was supported by qualitative data, as well as cross-sectional,
longitudinal and matched-dyad quantitative data drawn from four samples; an interview sample
(N=96), a pilot sample (N=39), a validation sample comprising 77 R&D project leaders and
234 team members, and a cross-validation sample of 67 managers and 214 of their direct
reports.

The willingness to be vulnerable formed two distinct factors, characterized by

Reliance and Disclosure. The BTI contributes to the literature by offering a valid, reliable and
multidimensional measure of trust applicable to leader-member and peer relationships.

<-----Page 2----->The importance of trust in work relationships has long been recognized by scholars and
practitioners from a diversity of disciplines, with early research dating back to the 1950’s
(Argyris, 1962; Blau, 1964; Gibb, 1964; Jennings, 1967; McGregor, 1967; Rotter, 1967;
Strickland, 1958). However, it has only been in the past decade that trust has taken a centre
stage in the organizational literature, as evidence of the significant benefits trust affords to
organizations, teams and individuals has accumulated (Kramer, 1999). Interpersonal trust in
work relationships has been consistently shown to positively relate to a range of productivityrelated behaviors and outcomes, such as organizational citizenship behaviors, individual job
performance, and group level performance, as well as work-place attitudes and cognitions, such
as job satisfaction, commitment and acceptance of decisions and goals (see review by Dirks &
Ferrin, 2001).
The past decade has also witnessed a convergence amongst organizational scholars on the
central features that define interpersonal trust at work (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998). Despite this convergence, however, there remains few validated scales that capture the
defining features of trust. Rather, as Currall and Judge (1995) observe, most research on trust
in organizations has neglected to link the conceptual definition of trust with its operational
definition.
This paper describes the development and validation of the Behavioral Trust Inventory (BTI), a
trust scale specifically designed to assess the willingness to be vulnerable in interpersonal work
relationships. The paper first discusses the defining features of trust, followed by the rationale
for the development of a new trust measure. Next, the development of the BTI is described,
followed by an examination of its dimensionality and validity. The paper concludes with a
discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the findings, the study’s limitations
and guidelines for future research.

<-----Page 3----->The Defining Features of Trust
A review of the literature from the organizational sciences over the past four decades reveals a
multitude of definitions for trust (e.g. Blois, 1999; Clark & Payne, 1997; Deutsch, 1960;
Gabarro, 1978; Gambetta, 1988; Hosmer, 1995; Johnson George & Swap, 1982; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; McAllister, 1995; Ring & Van de Ven,
1992; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Zand, 1972, 1997). Whilst there remains no single universally
accepted definition, a recent review by Rousseau et al., (1998) of a cross-disciplinary collection
of trust research and theory published in the Academy of Management Review, identified
convergence around the following definition of trust proposed by Mayer et al., (1995):
“the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party
based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action
important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that
other party.” (p. 712).
This definition is consistent with earlier conceptualizations of trust proposed by influential trust
theorists, Deutsch (1962) and Zand (1972). Rousseau et al. (1998) drew on Mayer et al.’s
(1995) work to define trust as, “…a psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another” (p.
395). Vulnerability is central to both of these trust definitions, and can be defined as the
condition of being open to harm, criticism or attack (Oxford Dictionary, 2002).
It is paradoxical that vulnerability is central to the definition of trust. To fully appreciate the
paradox, it is important to distinguish the trustor’s subjective experience of vulnerability when
engaging in behavior with another, from the objective vulnerability inherent in the behavior.
Consider, for example, a leader who shares sensitive information with a trusted member of his
or her team. The leader may experience little sense of vulnerability in sharing this information.
However, when the leader is faced with the decision of sharing the same information with a less
3

<-----Page 4----->trusted team member, the vulnerability in the act of sharing is likely to become more salient.
From an objective point of view, a violation of trust by either party would leave the leader
compromised and vulnerable.

However from the leader’s subjective point of view, the

experience of vulnerability is typically greater with the less trusted party.

Indeed, a

characteristic of high trust relationships is the absence of the experience of vulnerability, in the
context of behavior which would lead to vulnerability if trust was violated.
So the paradox is that vulnerability is central to trust, yet the subjective experience of
vulnerability typically decreases as the level of trust in the relationship increases.

Put

differently, behavior which in the absence of trust would make one feel vulnerable, may not
engender the feeling or recognition of vulnerability in the context of a trusting relationship.
This paradox does not negate the central importance of vulnerability as a defining feature of
trust.

Rather it highlights the importance of distinguishing the subjective experience of

vulnerability from the objective vulnerability inherent in trust behavior. In line with this
distinction, the current paper focuses on the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the
actions of another party, as evidenced by the trustor’s willingness to engage in behavior which
would objectively open them to vulnerability if the trust was violated. It is recognized that such
a willingness may or may not be coupled with the conscious experience of a sense of
vulnerability.
In addition to the view that a willingness to be vulnerable is central to the concept of trust, there
is widespread agreement amongst researchers on two other conditions required for trust to
exist. These are risk and interdependence (e.g. Bigley & Pearce, 1998; Hosmer, 1995; Lane &
Bachmann, 1996; Mishra, 1996; Rousseau et al., 1998; Whitener, Brodt, & Korsgaard, 1998;
Zand, 1972). As many scholars note, trust begins where rational prediction ends (e.g. Barber,
1983; Gambetta, 1988; Hosmer, 1995; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Luhmann, 1979; Zucker,
1986), and risk actually creates the opportunity for trust.

4

In interpersonal relationships,

<-----Page 5----->uncertainty regarding how the other will act is a key source of risk. Interdependence occurs
when the interests of one party cannot be achieved without reliance on the other party. That is,
there is some level of dependence on the uncertain behavior of others.
The Measurement of Trust
Despite general agreement amongst organizational researchers on these defining features of
trust, there are few trust scales or empirical studies that operationalise trust as the willingness to
be vulnerable (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002), and hence capture the interdependence and risk that is
central to trust. Rather, empirical studies often measure perceptions of trustworthiness as a
proxy for interpersonal trust (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Several dimensions of trustworthiness,
also referred to as the ‘conditions of trust’ (Butler, 1991), have been proposed in the literature
including ability, integrity, benevolence, reliability, openness and loyalty (Butler, 1991; Mayer
et al., 1995; Mishra, 1996).
There are three important reasons why perceived trustworthiness is not an acceptable proxy for
trust.

First, making judgments about another’s trustworthiness does not require risk,

vulnerability or interdependence, essential features that discriminate trust from related concepts
such as confidence and cooperation (e.g. Luhmann, 1988; Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al.,
1998). For example, Luhmann (1988) distinguishes trust and confidence by recognizing that
trust involves the willingness to assume risk whereas confidence does not.
Second, empirical evidence suggests that trust and trustworthiness are distinct factors that have
distinct relationships with other important constructs (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Mayer & Davis,
1999). For example, Mayer and Davis, (1999) show that trust in management, but not the
perceived trustworthiness of management, was enhanced through the implementation of a fairer
performance appraisal system.

In their meta-analysis, Dirks & Ferrin (2002) report that

measures of trustworthiness are more strongly associated with intentions to quit, commitment,
job satisfaction and procedural justice, whereas overall trust has a stronger relationship with

5

<-----Page 6----->civic virtue, performance and quality of the leader-member relationship. Davis et al., (2000)
report that trustworthiness accounts for only 46% of restaurant employees trust in their general
manager. These studies suggest that whilst trustworthiness is an important and significant
determinant of trust, it does not equate to trust. Third, several scholars have noted that the
practical significance of trust is in its action (Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Mayer et al., 1995).
From a measurement point of view, a willingness to be vulnerable by engaging in trusting
behavior is proximally closer to trust behavior than perceptions of another’s trustworthiness,
and therefore better able to predict actual trust behavior.
The gap between the definition and measurement of trust in the research literature may be
partly due to the absence of, and difficulties developing, instruments that reliably measure trust
as the willingness to be vulnerable.

Mayer et al., (1995) state “the most problematic

component of the model from the standpoint of measurement is trust itself” (p. 729). A review
of the literature reveals only a few validated measures that assess trust either in terms of the
willingness to be vulnerable or as intentions to engage in trusting behavior. These measures are
reported in Currall and Judge (1995), Cummings and Bromiley (1994), and Schoorman et al.
(1996). Each of these measures have made important contributions to the measurement of
trust. For the purpose of assessing interpersonal trust between leaders, members and peers,
however, these measures are limited. In the case of Currall and Judge (1995) and Cummings
and Bromiley (1994) the main limitation is due to the fact that these scales were designed for a
different purpose. As Currall and Judge (1995) state, their scale was developed to assess trust
between boundary role persons in different organizations. Cummings and Bromiley’s (1994)
Organizational Trust Inventory (OTI) was designed to assess trust between departmental units,
rather than between individuals working together in the same unit. Some dimensions and the
wording of many items from these two inventories are not applicable to leader-member and
peer relationships. In regard to Schoorman et al., (1996), the authors state that this four item

6

<-----Page 7----->scale requires further development to obtain adequate reliability and examine the
dimensionality of the willingness to be vulnerable (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Schoorman et al.’s
(1996) scale and the OTI also mix items assessing distrusting behavior with items assessing
trusting behavior. For example, the majority of the OTI behavioral intentions items focus on
monitoring, checking, documenting, questioning, and being cautious. Given the continuing
debate as to whether trust and distrust are part of the same construct or are distinct constructs
(Clark & Payne, 1997; Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998; Sitkin & Roth, 1993), it is unclear to
what extent these scales assess trust or distrust.
In summary, the organizational trust literature is characterized by a mismatch between the
defining features of trust and its measurement. A contributing factor to this problem is a lack of
well-validated trust measures that are congruent with its defining features. In particular there is
a lack of reliable survey measures that assess trust as the willingness to be vulnerable and are
applicable to leader-member and peer working relations. The development and validation of
the BTI was conducted to address this gap in the trust literature.
Conceptual Models
Two models underlie the conceptual framework of the BTI and its validation. These are Mayer
et al’s (1995) Integrative Model of Organizational Trust, and Zand’s (1972) model of trust.
The main features of these models pertinent to the development and validation of the BTI are
reviewed here.
Mayer et al.,’s (1995) Integrative Model of Organizational Trust distinguishes ‘trust’ from
‘trusting behavior’ (termed ‘risk-taking in the relationship’ in their model). As Mayer et al.,
(1995) state, “The fundamental difference between trust and trusting behaviors is between the
“willingness” to assume risk and actually “assuming” risk” (p. 724). Trust can, therefore, be
viewed as the willingness to engage in trusting behaviors in the relationship. Trust is also

7

<-----Page 8----->distinguished from perceptions of another’s trustworthiness (e.g. ability, integrity and
benevolence), which are viewed in the model as key determinants of trust.
Zand (1972) proposed that one’s trust in another is reflected in behavior related to influence,
information and control. In regard to influence, trust is evident in the acceptance of influence
from others and interdependence with others. In regard to information, when people trust they
disclose more accurate, relevant, and complete information and more fully share their thoughts
and feelings. In regards to control, distrust is evident in people’s attempt to control, monitor
and check on the behavior of others. Zand (1972) found support for his model through
observing the trusting behavior of 16 executive decision making groups that had been primed to
expect either trustworthy or untrustworthy behavior. He did not, however, develop survey
measures to test his theory.
Aims of the BTI
There were two aims in developing the BTI. First, the BTI was designed to measure a person’s
willingness to be vulnerable in a relationship with a specified other, across multiple domains of
trusting behavior. Specifically, the inventory required respondent’s to indicate their willingness
to engage in trusting behaviors with the target person. Recent meta-analyses have shown that
behavioral estimation items are strongly predictive of actual behavior across a wide range of
settings and behaviors (e.g. Armitage & Conner, 2001; Randall & Wolff, 1994; Sheeran &
Orbell, 1998; Sheppard, Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988). Second, the BTI was designed to
measure trust in leader-member and peer relationships in a team setting. Hence the inventory
needed to capture the essential features of these typically complex and highly interdependent
work relationships.

<-----Page 9----->Development of the BTI
Review of the Literature
A review of the trust literature and existing trust scales was conducted to identify common
behavioral expressions of trust that involved vulnerability, risk and interdependence in work
relationships. This review revealed that behavioral expressions of trust were largely captured
by Zand’s domains of accepting influence and interdependence, and sharing information,
whereas common behavioral expressions of distrust or a lack of trust were captured by Zand’s
domain of exerting control.
Behavioral examples of the acceptance of influence and interdependence include reliance on
others (Clark & Payne, 1997; Gabarro, 1978), delegation (Mayer et al., 1995; Rosen & Jerdee,
1977; Schoorman et al., 1996), entering into informal agreements and task coordination
(Currall & Judge, 1995; Mayer & Davis, 1999), promoting interdependence, pursuing
opportunities and new joint initiatives (Lewicki et al., 1998), as well as the general acceptance
of influence and interdependence (e.g. Gabarro, 1978; Mayer et al., 1995; Roberts & O'Reilly,
1974).

Examples of authors that have identified open information sharing and/or self-

disclosure as common expressions of trust include Clarke and Payne (1997), Currall and Judge
(1995), Cummings and Bromiley (1994), Gabarro (1978), Jones and George (1998), McAllister
(1995), Rempel, Holmes and Zanna (1985), Roberts and O’Reilly (1974), Scott (1983) and
Weber (1998). In regard to exerting control, monitoring, checking and surveillance behaviors
were common examples of a lack of trust and/or distrust (Cummings & Bromiley, 1994;
Currall & Judge, 1995; Mayer & Davis, 1999; Strickland, 1958).
Qualitative Investigation
To examine the extent to which these behavioral domains were appropriate and important to
leader-member and peer relations, interviews were carried out with 32 “triads” consisting of

9

<-----Page 10----->project leaders and two of their team members drawn from 2 divisions of a large public
research and development (R&D) organization.

This resulted in a total of 96 separate

interviews. As part of a broader interview on trust, leaders were asked to identify trust and
distrust behaviors in their relationship with their two team members, and team members were
asked to identify trust and distrust behaviors in their relationship with their leader and the other
team member in the triad (ie their peer). To avoid leading respondents, no prompts or
examples were provided by the interviewer. The interview transcripts were examined and
descriptions of trusting behaviors extracted.
Two domains of trust behavior were identified. These were 1) Reliance: that is, relying on
another’s skills, knowledge, judgments or actions, including delegating and giving autonomy,
and 2) Disclosure: that is, sharing work-related or personal information of a sensitive nature.
These categories overlap with Zand’s (1972) domains of accepting influence and
interdependence, and sharing information. In keeping with the view that in most relationships
people choose to trust in some ways and not others (e.g. Lewicki et al., 1998; Lewis & Weigert,
1985), the following hypothesis was made;
Hypothesis 1: The domains of disclosure and reliance form distinct dimensions of trust
behavior.
Respondents also described the presence of controlling, monitoring and checking behavior as
evidence of distrust. This is congruent with emerging evidence suggesting that trust and
distrust are distinct concepts (see Clark & Payne, 1997; Lewicki et al., 1998) rather than
opposite ends of the same continuum. Therefore these behaviors were not included as a
domain of trusting behavior. Respondents described the absence of controlling and monitoring
behaviors as indicative of trust only when coupled with an act of reliance, delegation or sharing
of sensitive information. That is, the absence of controlling behaviors alone was not described
as a demonstration of trust. For example, a leader who rarely monitored how his or her team
10

<-----Page 11----->members went about their work, was not usually seen as trusting, unless the leader also
delegated and relied on his or her team members to accomplish important tasks. This suggests
that the absence of controlling behavior may not be a separate domain of trusting behavior, but
rather a component of the willingness to trust through relying on and sharing information with
another.
Two additional behaviors were described that did not fit the above categories. These were
supporting or being an advocate for the other person publicly (mentioned by two leaders) and
making decisions without consulting the leader when under time pressure (mentioned by two
team members). These were not, however, common themes.
Item Generation and Piloting
An initial pool of 50 items tapping reliance and disclosure behaviors was generated from the
interviews, the trust literature and existing instruments. Care was taken to word the items in a
way that made them generalisable to both leader-member and peer relations, and work
relationships beyond the field of R&D.
Two pilot studies were conducted. The initial set of 50 items was piloted on 15 people working
in project teams in different organizations and industries. Respondents were asked to think of a
specific member of their team and indicate; 1) how willing they were to engage in each trusting
behavior with this member, 2) whether engaging in the behavior reflected their trust in this
member, and 3) any items they had difficulty responding to or understanding. The second
question was used to check the content validity of the items (Ghiselli, Campbell, & Zedeck,
1981). A pool of 39 items remained after deleting items that were not consistently judged to
indicate trust or were difficult to understand.
A second pilot study was conducted on 24 R&D project staff (8 project leaders and 16 team
members). Leaders were asked to complete the instrument in regard to the team member they

11

<-----Page 12----->trusted most and the team member they trusted least. All team members were asked to
complete the instrument in regard to their project leader. In addition, half the team members
were asked to complete the instrument in regard to the team member they trusted most, and the
other half, the team member they trusted least. Respondents were asked to rate each trusting
behavior using three response scales. The first asked them to rate how willing they would be to
engage in each of the behaviors with the referent (i.e. ‘How willing are you to do the following
with this Team Member?’). The response scale ranged from “Not at all willing” (1) to
“Completely willing” (7). Respondents were provided with the option of rating items 5, 9, 10,
12 and 14 as not applicable, ‘if this behavior is not expected of a member at this occupational
level.’ The second and third scales asked whether there had been an opportunity to engage in
the behavior with the referent (i.e. ‘Have you had the opportunity to do this with your
Member?’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’), and if so, whether they had actually engaged in the behavior (i.e.
‘Have you done this with your Member?’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’). Respondents were also asked to
describe any additional behaviors not covered by the questionnaire that showed they trusted
their leader and/or team member(s), and to rate their overall trust in these relationships. These
data were used to identify and delete uncommon trusting behaviors and items that failed to
distinguish between high and low trust relationships. No new domains of trusting behavior
were identified.
The version of the BTI used in the validation study comprised 15 items. The same response
scales described above in pilot study 2 were used. Three items differed across the ‘leader rating
team member’, ‘team member rating leader’ and ‘peer rating peer’ versions of the questionnaire
(see Table 1, items 10, 12, and 15). The leader version also included an additional three items
assessing the willingness to delegate.

12

<-----Page 13----->Validation Study
Hypotheses
An hypothesis testing approach to establishing construct validity was adopted (Landy, 1986;
Nunnally, 1978). This approach involves testing whether the measure behaves as hypothesized
in relation to other variables within the nomological network (Chronbach & Meehl, 1955). The
theoretical and empirical evidence supporting each of the hypotheses is discussed below. For
ease of expression, the term team member is used in these hypotheses to refer to both leaders
and team members.
In the Integrative Model of Organizational Trust, Mayer et al., (1995) propose that the extent to
which a person is willing to trust another is based largely on the trustor’s beliefs about the
trustworthiness of the trustee. Several empirical studies support a strong relationship between
trustworthiness and trust (e.g. Currall & Judge, 1995; Davis et al., 2000; Mayer & Davis,
1999). For example, Currall and Judge (1995) found that a person’s perception of the past
trustworthiness of another party strongly correlated (r=.72, p<.01) with that person’s behavioral
reliance on that party. This evidence supports the second hypotheses made in this paper.
Hypothesis 2: A person’s perception of the trustworthiness of a team member will have a
strong positive correlation with their willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards
that team member.
Whilst feelings of trust and distrust may simultaneously coexist in a relationship, the two
constructs are acknowledged to be linked (Lewicki et al., 1998; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). When
feelings of distrust towards another generalize across many aspects of the relationship or
domains of behavior, distrust typically undermines and reduces the level of trust in the
relationship.

13

<-----Page 14----->Hypothesis 3: A person’s distrust towards a team member will be negatively correlated
with their willingness to engage in trusting behavior with that team member.
Trust is believed to develop over time (e.g. Blau, 1964; Burt & Knex, 1996; Strickland, 1958;
Zand, 1972). Trust typically increases with the duration of the relationship (Burt & Knex,
1996; Currall & Judge, 1995) and the frequency of interaction (Becerra & Gupta, 2003; Burt &
Knex, 1996; Cherry, 2000; Doney & Cannon, 1997). The level of interdependence in the
working relationship and the perceived risk associated with a loss of trust in the relationship
also creates an incentive to build and maintain trust, as parties know they need to rely on each
other in an ongoing capacity. These factors can be viewed together as indicators of the strength
of the relationship. It is recognized that the links between the strength of the relationship and
trust are reciprocal.
Hypothesis 4:

The greater the strength of the relationship (i.e. the duration of the

relationship, extent of interaction, level of interdependence, and perceived risk associated
with a loss of trust), the greater the willingness to engage in trusting behavior in that
relationship.
Several theorists have proposed that common values and common goals facilitate trust
development (e.g. Hart, Capps, Cangemi, & Caillouet, 1986; Jones & George, 1998; Whitener
et al., 1998). Sharing common values and goals may assist parties to be more willing to engage
in trusting behavior as it minimizes the threat of opportunistic or untrustworthy behavior that
would violate the trustor’s values, or work against his or her goals (Gillespie & Mann, 2000).
Hypothesis 5: The more team members perceive they share common values and/or goals,
the greater their willingness to engage in trusting behavior toward each other.
Team members are likely to be more willing to trust another member of the team, and in
particular rely on them, when they are satisfied with the member’s work performance. This
gives the trustor assurance about the other’s competence and that their trust is well placed.

14

<-----Page 15----->Hypothesis 6: The greater a person’s satisfaction with the performance of a team member,
the greater their willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards that team member.
In line with theory and empirical research indicating that trust enhances cooperation, openness
of communication, and commitment in relationships (for a review of this literature see Dirks &
Ferrin, 2001) and is an important predictor of relationship effectiveness (Graen & Uhl-Bien,
1995; McAllister, 1995; Robinson, 1996), the following hypothesis was made.
Hypothesis 7: The more willing team members are to engage in trusting behavior with
each other, the more effective their working relationship will be.
It was also hypothesized that team members’ willingness to trust would be moderately
associated with their trust in the team. This is based on the assumption that when assessing
one’s trust in the team as a whole, one considers trust towards the leader and each of the
members contributing to the team. Hence, trust towards any one member influences the overall
trust in the team. One’s trust in the team may also directly affect one’s willingness to trust the
leader and certain members of the team, due to the normative pressure and expectation to
cooperate and trust team members.
Hypothesis 8: A person’s trust in their team overall will be positively correlated with their
willingness to engage in trusting behavior toward a specific member of the team.
Much of the early work on trust conducted by psychologists focused on the distinction between
generalised and specific trust (e.g Rotter, 1967; Farris, Senner & Butterfield, 1973).
Generalised trust, also called disposition or propensity to trust, refers to a stable personality trait
reflecting a person’s willingness to trust others in general, across situations. People with a high
trust disposition believe that others are honest and well-intentioned, whilst those with a low
trust disposition tend to be cynical and skeptical and assume others may be dishonest (Costa &
McCrae, 1992).

15

<-----Page 16----->In their review of the research examining the influence of disposition to trust on specific trust in
another, Johnson-George & Swap (1982) conclude that disposition to trust only influences
trusting behavior early in a relationship when one has little else to rely on. In line with this
conclusion, several theoretical models of trust development include disposition to trust as a
predictor of the willingness to trust another early in the relationship, when little information is
known about the other party (e.g. Mayer et al., 1995; McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany,
1998). As information about the trustworthiness of the other is gathered through interaction
and experience, the influence of disposition on specific trust is expected to decline.
Several empirical studies conducted since Johnson-George & Swap’s review (1982) report a
weak significant positive relationship between disposition to trust and trust towards another,
irrespective of the duration of the relationship. For example, in their recent meta-analysis of
trust in leadership, Dirks & Ferrin (2002) found a small significant relationship between
disposition to trust and trust in one’s leader. On the basis of this evidence, the following two
hypotheses were made.
Hypothesis 9: A person’s disposition to trust will have a weak positive correlation with
their willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards a specific member of their team.
Hypothesis 10: A person’s disposition to trust will have a stronger positive correlation
with their willingness to engage in trusting behavior, during the earlier stages of the
working relationship.
These nine hypotheses pose relationships between constructs collected from the same person
about their relationship with a specified target person. Hypotheses were also posed between
constructs collected independently from members of matched dyads.

Hypotheses 11-13

described below, draw on the body of theory (e.g. Blau, 1964; Strickland, 1958; Whitener et al.,
1998; Zand, 1972) and empirical research (e.g. Butler, 1983, 1986, 1991; Molm, Takahashi, &

16

<-----Page 17----->Peterson, 2000; Zand, 1972) which suggests that trust is reciprocal in nature. Hypothesis 14-16
are the same as hypotheses 4, 5, and 7 posed at the dyadic level.
Hypothesis 11: Member 1’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards Member 2,
will be positively correlated with Member 2’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior
towards Member 1.
Hypothesis 12: Member 1’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards Member 2
will be positively correlated with Member 2’s perception of the trustworthiness of Member
1.
Hypothesis 13: Member 1’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards Member 2
will be negatively correlated with Member 2’s distrust in Member 1.
Hypothesis 14: Member 1’s ratings of the strength of the relationship (ie. extent of
interaction, level of interdependence, and perceived risk associated with a loss of trust),
will be positively correlated with Member 2’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior
towards Member 1.
Hypothesis 15: The greater Member 1’s perception of common values or common goals in
the relationship, the greater Member 2’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior toward
Member 1.
Hypothesis 16: Member 1’s willingness to engage in trusting behavior towards Member 2
will be positively correlated with Member 2’s perception of the effectiveness of their
relationship with Member 1.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Questionnaires were administered to all project staff (N=486) at two divisions of a large public
R&D organization. Project leaders completed the questionnaire in relation to two specified
17

<-----Page 18----->team members, randomly selected by the researcher.

Team members completed the

questionnaire in relation to their project leader and one specified team member, randomly
chosen by the researcher. Participation in the research was voluntary and confidentiality was
assured.

Eliminating surveys with missing data produced a sample of 77 leaders (89%

response rate) and 234 team members (59% response rate), representing 87 project teams and
an overall response rate of 64%. Within this sample were 88 matched leader-member dyads
and 39 matched peer dyads.1
41% of the responding team members and 12% of project leaders were female. The mean age
was 41 years. On average, team members had worked directly with their project leader for 3.5
years and with their selected peer for 2.5 years. Teams were composed of an average of six
members (including the project leader), with an average response rate of 3.4 members per team.
To test for non-response bias, the demographics of the sample of respondents and non
respondents was compared. Four demographic variables were available for both samples,
namely the proportion of males and females, age, tenure, and occupational level. There were
no significant differences between the two samples on these variables.
Measures
In addition to the BTI, the questionnaire included the measures described below.
Trustworthiness. A short-form of the Conditions of Trust Inventory (Butler, 1991) was used.
The original 44 item inventory measures the extent to which the rater believes the specified
1

Most leaders rated two team members in the sample which raises the issue of independence of the observations
from those cases. To limit the effect of this potential bias, all analyses reported on the leader sample used
leaders’ ratings of only one team member, randomly chosen. All analyses using matched leader-member dyads
were conducted on the overall sample of matched leader-member dyads (n=88) and a sub-sample consisting of
only independent leader-member dyads (n=67). The results from these two samples were compared and found
to be substantively identical.

18

<-----Page 19----->person fulfills eleven conditions of trust, namely: competence, integrity, consistency,
discreetness, fairness, promise fulfillment, loyalty, availability, openness, receptivity, and
overall trustworthiness. The short-form comprised the eleven items with the highest factor
loading for its respective trust condition, that were appropriate for rating leaders, team members
and peers. The measure was rated on a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly
agree). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques conducted on the 11 items
consistently supported a unidimensional factor structure (α = .94).
Disposition to trust. The eight-item trust facet from the NEO Personality Inventory Revised;
(NEO PI-R, Costa & McCrae, 1992) was used to measure respondents’ general disposition to
trust others. A five-point scale was used (0 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree, α = .83).
Trust in the team. Porter & Lilly’s (1996) four-item measure of trust in the team was used.
This scale requires respondents to rate their own trust in the team on a seven-point scale (1 =
strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree, α = .86).
Distrust. This four-item measure was adapted from Lewicki et al., (1998) and measures
caution, guardedness, feelings of cynicism towards the other, and the person’s desire to
minimize the other’s influence on them. A five-point scale was used (1 = strongly disagree, 5 =
strongly agree, α = .84).
Common values. A two-item measure was used to assess the extent to which the respondent
shared common values with their leader/team member(s). A seven-point scale was used (1 = to
a very small extent, 7 = to a very great extent, α = .79).
Common goals. A two-item measure was used to assess the extent to which the respondent
shared common goals with their leader/team member(s). A five-point scale was used (1 =
strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree, α = .73).
Interdependence. Two measures of interdependence were used. Van der Vegt, Emans & De
Vliert’s (1999) five item work interdependence measure assessed the extent to which the
19

<-----Page 20----->respondent’s work involves dependence on their leader or specified team member. A five-point
scale was used (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree, α = .85). The second measure was
created by Pirola-Merlo (2000) based on Thompson’s (1967) typology of task interdependence,
namely no interdependence (0), pooled (1), sequential (2) and reciprocal (3). Respondents
were asked to identify the highest level of interdependence in each working relationship during
the previous year.
Risk in the relationship. A six item measure of risk in the relationship was developed from a
review of the trust literature and 15 pilot interviews. This measure asked respondents to rate
the extent to which having no trust in each specified working relationship would cause
difficulty, both professionally (e.g. ‘difficulty in your career’, ‘difficulty in doing your work’),
and personally (e.g. ‘emotional distress’, ‘difficulty in your relations with others’). A sevenpoint scale was used (1 = a very small extent, 7 = a very great extent, α = .89).
Strength of the relationship. A three-item measure of interaction frequency, derived from
McAllister, (1995) was included. This measured how often the respondent interacted at work
and outside of work with their leader/team member(s). Items were rated on a seven-point scale
(1 = never, 7 = daily). Respondents also estimated the length of their working relationships
(months and years) with their leader/team member(s), and the duration of face-to-face contact
per week (minutes and hours), both at work and socially outside of work.
Relationship effectiveness. Respondents rated the question, “How effective is your working
relationship with your leader/team member?” on a seven-point scale (1 = extremely ineffective,
7 = extremely effective). This item comes from the Leader Member Exchange scale (Graen &
Uhl-Bien, 1995) and is reported to be the single best item for measuring the quality of leadermember exchange (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995).
Overall trust. Respondents rated the question, "How would you rate your overall trust in…?"
on a seven-point scale (1 = no trust, 7 = complete trust).

20

<-----Page 21----->Satisfaction with performance.

Respondents rated their overall satisfaction with the

performance of the leader/team member, using a seven-point scale (1 = very dissatisfied, 7 =
very satisfied).
Leadership Outcomes. Team members also completed two measures of leadership outcomes
from the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ, Form 5X, Avolio, Bass, & Jung, 1996).
These measures assessed team members’ perceptions of the effectiveness of their leader (4
items, α = .83) and their satisfaction with the leader (2 items, α = .84), rated on a five-point
scale (0 = not at all, 4 = frequently/always).
Participants in the longitudinal sample
64 of the project staff (27 leaders, 37 team members) in the validation study completed a
questionnaire 18 months prior to completing the questionnaire described above. This earlier
questionnaire included the following same measures used in the validation study;
trustworthiness, task interdependence, risk in the relationship, common values, common goals,
satisfaction with performance, relationship effectiveness, disposition to trust, and overall trust.
It did not include the BTI as it had not yet been developed.
Results
Exploratory factor analyses
Due to the preliminary nature of the inventory, exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were initially
conducted to explore the dimensionality of the BTI prior to testing the hypothesized two factor
structure through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). An EFA using Principal Components
extraction with oblique (Promax) rotation was first conducted on the sample of team members
rating their leaders. Two factors were extracted with eigenvalues greater than 1, accounting for
69% of the variance. An examination of the scree plot also indicated a two factor structure,
which was confirmed using both parallel analysis and Velicer’s minimum average partial
(MAP) test (O'Connor, 2000). These same two factors were extracted using Principal Axis
21

<-----Page 22----->Factoring and orthogonal rotation, suggesting that the factor structure is stable (Tabachnik &
Fidell, 1996).
These analyses were replicated on the sample of team members rating peers, leaders rating
team members, and then on the combined sample of leader and team member ratings. A two
factor solution was consistently found with similar loadings for the marker variables. The
pattern matrix from the Principal Components analysis is reproduced in Table 1, the four
columns representing the different samples. The first factor was consistently defined by seven
marker variables corresponding to “Reliance” and the second by five marker variables
indicating “Disclosure.” The remaining three items were complex variables with significant
cross loadings ranging from .30 to .57 on both factors (items 2, 8, and 15). These results
support the hypothesized two factor structure and suggest that Reliance and Disclosure are
distinct factors of trust (Hypothesis 1).
The consistency of the pattern matrix across the three samples suggests that the factor structure
holds for team members’ upward assessment of their leaders, team members’ lateral assessment
of their peers, and leaders’ downward assessment of their team members. Moreover, although
the leader sample was small, Guadagnoli & Velicer (1988) report that a sample size of N=50 is
sufficient when factors are defined by four or more variables with loadings above .60 (p. 274).
The leader version of the BTI also included three items on delegation. When these three
delegation items were included in the factor analysis, the same two factor solution was
obtained, with each of the delegation items loading highly on the Reliance factor.
As noted at the bottom of Table 1, three items were worded differently across the team
member, peer and leader versions (items 10, 12, and 15). To gain the advantage of using the
same scale to assess trust in leaders, team members and peers, the five items with common
wording across the three versions of the BTI and the highest factor loadings were used to

22

<-----Page 23----->measure the Reliance dimension, viz items 1, 5, 9, 14 and 13, and the Disclosure dimension, viz
items 3, 4, 6, 7, and 11. These items are shaded in Table 1.
Confirmatory factor analyses
One of the limitations of EFA is its inability to empirically investigate and test competing
hypotheses about the structure of a given set of items (Tabachnik & Fidell, 1996). CFA was
therefore used to compare the fit of three competing nested models. The fit of each model was
tested simultaneously on the samples of team members rating leaders and leaders rating team
members, using the ‘manage groups’ option in AMOS 4. This technique assesses the same
factor structure across the two groups but enables regression weights, unique variances and
covariances to differ between the groups. As the fit of the model is calculated using the data
from both groups, only one set of fit statistics are provided. The value of the chi-square and the
degrees of freedom are doubled to reflect the two samples.
Table 2 shows the goodness-of-fit statistics and the chi-square statistics used to compare the
relative fit of three competing models; an independence (null) model, a unidimensional model,
and a two factor model (Reliance, Disclosure). The independence model assumes that there are
no relationships between the 10 items, thus providing a base-line from which to compare the
relative fit of all other models (Bollen & Long, 1992; Byrne, 2001; Gerbing & Anderson,
1992). The unidimensional model assumes that all items assess one underlying trust construct.
This was used to test the hypothesis that one factor provides the best fit to the data. That is,
people do not discriminate between their willingness to rely on and their willingness to disclose
information to others with whom they work. The two factor model tests the hypothesis that the
items measure two correlated, but distinct constructs with no cross-loadings.
Chi square difference tests indicated that the two factor model was a significantly better fit than
both the independence model (χ2diff (66) = 2113.59, p<.001) and the unidimensional model
(χ2diff (2) = 240.02. p<.001). This two factor model also provided a good fit to the data. As

23

<-----Page 24----->shown in the last row of Table 2, all fit statistics were within the expected range. The CFI was
above the recommended value of .95 (Hu & Bentler, 1995), the RMSEA was below the .08
cut off (Browne & Cudeck, 1993), and the SRMR was below the .05 cut off (Byrne, 2001).
The ECVI indicated the two factor structure was more replicable than the one factor model
(Byrne, 2001).
In the two factor model, all items loaded onto their hypothesized factor and all parameter
estimates were significant at the .01 level. These two factors were also measured well. The
convention accepted in the measurement literature suggests that factor loadings should
average .70, as the items should account for 50% of the shared variation within the factor
(Bagozzi, 1993).

All factor loadings were equal to, or greater than .72 for both team

members rating leaders (M = .81, SD = .06), and leaders rating team members (M = .83, SD
= .09). The average amount of variance extracted by the Reliance and Disclosure factors was
above the minimum acceptable standard in the measurement literature, at .82 and .80
respectively for the team member rating leader sample, and .88 and .78 respectively for the
leader rating team member sample (Bagozzi, 1993).
Together, these results support the hypothesis that Reliance and Disclosure are two distinct
dimensions of trust.

In other words, it is possible to discriminate between a person’s

willingness to trust another by relying on them, from a person’s willingness to trust another by
disclosing personal or sensitive information to them. The results also indicate that the variance
across the BTI items is adequately captured by these two dimensions.
Reliability analysis and descriptive statistics
Table 3 displays the descriptive statistics for the two five item BTI factors. The coefficient
alpha reliabilities of the two factors were high. The two factors correlated .71 in the team
member rating leader sample, .61 in the leader sample, and .65 in the team member rating peer
sample.

24

<-----Page 25----->On average, team members, leaders and peers in the sample were very willing to rely on and
disclose information to each other. The mean for Reliance was higher than for Disclosure,
indicating that team members (t (233) = 9.48, p<.001), leaders (t (76) = 4.47, p<.001), and
peers (t (219) = 8.25, p<.001) were more willing to rely on each other than to disclose
information. Leaders were significantly more willing to rely on their team members than team
members were willing to rely on their peers [F (1,292) = 4.43, p<.05]. There was no significant
difference, however, between leaders’ and team members’ ratings of reliance on each other.
Nor was there any significant difference between the groups’ ratings of their willingness to
disclose. There was a good range in ratings for both factors, indicating that some leaders and
team members were not willing to rely on others or to make disclosures, whereas other leaders
and team members were completely willing. This range suggests that the items and the rating
scales are sensitive to variations in the level of trust in these relationships.
Content validity
The content validity of the BTI was further examined by assessing responses to the open-ended
survey question ‘list two or three key behaviors that show you trust your… leader, peer/team
member’. This question preceded the BTI in the survey, to ensure that responses would not be
primed by exposure to the BTI. The behaviors identified fell within the two dimensions of
Reliance and Disclosure, suggesting that these two dimensions capture the key behavioral
indicators of trust in working relationships.
Common reliance behaviors team members and leaders described included: relying on their
leader’s or team member’s skills, abilities, advice and judgments; relying on the accuracy and
quality of their work; and relying on the information they provided. Leaders also described
delegating responsibility and tasks, and giving autonomy to team members. Examples of
common disclosure behaviors included ‘communicating one’s views openly and honestly’,

25

<-----Page 26----->‘sharing sensitive information’, sharing problems and feelings (both work and personal
domains), and admitting mistakes and lack of knowledge.
The extent to which each of the trusting behaviors in the BTI were relevant in the workplace
was also explored. Most team members and leaders reported that they had had the opportunity
to engage in each of the trusting behaviors in the specific working relationship. Between 63%
and 90% of respondents indicated that they had had the opportunity to engage in each of the
five reliance and five disclosure behaviors with their team member(s) and/or leader. The
majority (89%+) who reported having had the opportunity also stated they had actually
engaged in that trusting behavior within the specified relationship.

A few respondents

commented that their trusting behavior in these relationships had led to negative outcomes and,
hence, they were now not willing to trust those people again.
Convergent validity
Table 4 shows the correlations between the Reliance and Disclosure scales and the nomological
net of hypothesized correlates. There was general support for the hypothesized associations.
Specifically, in relation to hypotheses 2-9, it was found that the willingness to rely and disclose
in the relationship was greater when the trustor perceived the other as trustworthy (H2), had
low distrust in the other (H3), had more frequent and longer interactions (H4), worked in a
more interdependent manner (H4), believed a break down of trust in the relationship would
cause a lot of difficulty (H4), perceived shared values and goals (H5), was satisfied with the
other’s performance (H6), perceived the relationship as highly effective (H7), trusted the team
(H8), and had a trusting disposition (H9). The willingness to rely and disclose was also
strongly significantly associated with overall ratings of trust. Most of these hypotheses held for
both team members’ ratings of leaders and peers, and for leaders’ ratings of team members.
In relation to hypothesis 10, team members’ disposition to trust had a stronger association with
their willingness to rely on and disclose in the leader, for working relationships that were in
26

<-----Page 27----->their first year (rreliance= .55, p<.001; rdisclose =.45, p<.01, n=48) compared to relationships that
had exceeded a year (rreliance =.21, p<.01; rdisclose =.25, p<.01, n=162). The same pattern was
found for team members rating their peers. Correlations between disposition to trust and trust
were stronger for peer relationships in their first year (rreliance = .45, p<.001; rdisclose =.42, p<.01,
n=59), compared to relationships that had exceeded a year (rreliance =.08, ns; rdisclose =.16, p<.05,
n=154). The sample of leaders in the first year of the relationship with their specified team
member was too small (n=13) to enable meaningful analyses.
Whilst these results support the hypotheses and the convergent validity of the BTI, the
associations may be inflated due to common method variance, as all measures came from the
same survey completed by the same person at the same time. Two methods were used to limit
the influence of common method variance. First, a subset of the hypotheses was examined
using measures completed 18 months apart by the longitudinal sample (n=64). Second, the set
of hypotheses posed at the dyadic level (hypotheses 11-16) were tested using measures
completed independently by different members of the dyad (ndyads=127).
Using the longitudinal sample, the set of variables collected 18 months prior to the validation
study were correlated with the BTI ratings collected during the validation study.

These

correlations are displayed in Table 5, and provide longitudinal support for five of the six
hypotheses tested (the exception was the lack of support for hypothesis 9 regarding the
relationship between disposition to trust and willingness to engage in trust behavior). These
significant relationships between measures collected 18 months apart suggest the hypothesized
associations are not due to common method variance associated with completing the survey at
the same point in time.
Using matched leader-member dyads (n=88), significant relationships were found between
leaders’ ratings of their team member’s trustworthiness and the team member’s willingness to
rely on (r=.35, p<.001, H12) and disclose to the leader (r=.32, p<.001, H12). Team members’
27

<-----Page 28----->willingness to rely on and disclose in their leader was also negatively associated with their
leader’s distrust in the team member (r= -.30, p<.01; r= -.31, p<.01; H13), and positively
associated with their leader’s rating of the strength of the relationship (H14), including the
frequency of interaction (r=.30, p<.01; r=.31, p<.01), the risk associated with a loss of trust
(r=.28, p<.01; r=.27, p<.01), and the work interdependence in the relationship (r=.22, p<.05;
non-significant for disclosure). Team members’ willingness to rely on and disclose in their
leader was also positively associated with the leader’s rating of common goals (r=.30, p<.01;
r=.33, p<.01; H15) and common values in the relationship (r=.20, p<.05; r=.23, p<.05; H15),
and the leader’s perception of the effectiveness of the relationship (r=.37, p<.001; r=.37,
p<.001; H16).
Using matched peer dyads (n=39), a significant relationship was found between team members’
ratings of their peer’s trustworthiness, and that peer’s willingness to disclose in (r=.32, p<.05;
H12) but not rely on this team member (r=.20, p>.05; H12). A significant association was also
found between one peer’s willingness to rely and disclose, and the other peer’s rating of the
strength of the relationship (H14), particularly the frequency of interaction (r=.38, p<.01; r=.34,
p<.05) and the risk in the relationship (r=.30, p<.05, disclosure only), and the perception of
common values and goals in the relationship (r=.36, p<.05; r=.35, p<.05; H15).

Team

members’ willingness to disclose in their peer was also correlated with that peer’s rating of the
effectiveness of the relationship (r=.28, p<.05; H16), however there was no significant
relationship between reliance and effectiveness. These findings from matched dyads provide
support for hypotheses 11-16 and add to the convergent validity of the BTI. The fact that these
significant relationships were obtained from data collected from independent raters further
indicates the relationships are not due to common method variance.

28

<-----Page 29----->Discriminant validity
Support for the divergent validity of the BTI came from three sets of analyses.

First,

confirmatory factor analyses showed that reliance and disclosure are distinct constructs from
trustworthiness and distrust, and from each other.

Five competing nested models were

compared. Model 1 was a unidimensional model where all reliance, disclosure, trustworthiness
and distrust items loaded onto a single factor. Model 2 was a two factor model where the
reliance and disclosure items loaded onto one ‘Trust’ factor and all other items loaded onto a
‘Trustworthiness-Distrust’ factor. Model 3 was also a two factor model, however, the reliance,
disclosure and trustworthiness items loaded onto one ‘Trust-Trustworthiness’ factor, and the
distrust items loaded onto a second factor. Model 4 was a three factor model where the reliance
and disclosure items formed one ‘Trust’ factor, the ‘Trustworthiness’ items formed the second
factor, and the ‘Distrust’ items the third factor. Model 5 was the proposed four factor model of
‘Reliance’, ‘Disclosure’, ‘Trustworthiness’ and ‘Distrust’. These analyses were conducted
simultaneously on the member rating leader (n=231) and leader rating member (n=75) samples,
using the ‘Manage Groups’ option in AMOS 4.
Table 6 displays the goodness-of-fit statistics and the chi-square statistics used to compare the
relative fit of the competing models. Chi-square difference tests revealed that the proposed
four factor model (model 5) was a significantly better fit than each of the other models (Model
1, χ2diff (16) = 769.34, p<.001; Model 2, χ2diff (14) = 496.92, p<.001; Model 3, χ2diff (14) =
485.51. p<.001; Model 4, χ2diff (6) = 253.52. p<.001). The four factor model was also an
acceptable fit to the data. All items loaded onto their respective factor and all parameter
estimates were significant at the p<.01 level. These results indicate that it is possible to
distinguish a person’s beliefs about another’s trustworthiness, from their willingness to rely on
and disclose to that person, as well as from their distrust towards the person.

29

<-----Page 30----->Second, using matched dyads, reliance and disclosure were found to differ in the extent to
which they were reciprocated in peer relationships. Disclosure was found to be moderately
reciprocated between peers (r=.41, p<.01, n=37), whereas reliance was not significantly
reciprocated (r=.10, p>.05, n=37). That is, one peer’s willingness to rely on the other was
uncorrelated with the other peer’s willingness to rely on them. In contrast, both reliance and
disclosure were weakly reciprocated in leader-member matched dyads (r=.26, p<.01; r=.22,
p<.01, n=89; respectively). The same pattern of findings was found when controlling for
disposition to trust. These findings provide support for a weak reciprocal relationship between
components of behavioral trust in leader-member relationships and between disclosure in peer
relationships (hypothesis 11).

The findings provide further evidence of the empirical

distinction between the two trust dimensions.
Third, reliance and disclosure were found to have distinct relationships with trustworthiness
overall trust, and satisfaction with performance in leader-member relations (see Table 4).
Specifically, using Fisher’s Z test, reliance was found to be more strongly associated with these
correlates than disclosure (team members: rtrustworthy =.80 vs .65, p<.001; rovtrust =.82 vs .66,
p<.001; rperformance =.75 vs .60, p<.01; leaders: rtrustworthy =.77 vs .59, p<.05; rovtrust =.84 vs .57,
p<.05; rperformance =.84 vs .58, p<.001).

This pattern was not, however, found in peer

relationships. The leader’s willingness to rely on their team member also had a stronger
relationship with their trust in the team (r=.67 vs .25, p<.001) and the effectiveness of the
relationship (r=.73 vs .52, p<.05), than their willingness to disclose. Whilst the direction of
causality cannot be ascertained by these correlations, these findings suggest that in leadermember relationships feeling comfortable to rely on another is more strongly associated with
overall trust, whereas feeling comfortable to rely and disclose are of similar importance to
overall trust in peer relationships.

30

<-----Page 31----->Predictive validity
Trust in one’s leader has been shown to predict important leadership outcomes, such as
satisfaction with the leader and the effectiveness of the leader. For example, the meta-analytic
findings reported by Dirks & Ferrin (2002) indicate an average correlation of r=.73 between
trust in one’s leader and satisfaction with the leader. To establish the predictive validity of the
BTI, and in particular examine whether the BTI contributes to the prediction of these leadership
outcomes beyond that afforded by an existing measure of trustworthiness, a series of
hierarchical linear models were computed.
The first model regressed team members’ perceptions of their leader’s trustworthiness (step 1)
and their trust in the leader as measured by the BTI (step 2) onto ratings of satisfaction with the
leader. The second model repeated this regression with ratings of the effectiveness of the
leader as the dependent variable. Table 7 displays the R2, change in R2, and the standardised
regression coefficients (β).
Examining the results for satisfaction with the leader first, the addition of the trust ratings from
the BTI in Step 2, significantly increased R2, ∆ R2=.09, Finc(1, 225) = 53.32, p<.001. Both
perceptions of the leaders’ trustworthiness (β=.43, p<.001) and trust in the leader (β=.46,
p<.001) were positively related to satisfaction with the leader.

The final R2=.71,

F(2,225)=269.42, p<.001, indicating that 71% of the variability in satisfaction towards the
leader was accounted for by the two variables. The results for leader effectiveness were
similar. The addition of the trust ratings from the BTI in Step 2, significantly increased R2,
∆R2=.07, Finc(1, 226) = 41.63, p<.001. The final R2=.65, F(2,226)=209.19, p<.001, indicating
that 65% of the variability in leader effectiveness was accounted for by the two variables.
These findings indicate that despite the strong correlation between BTI trust ratings and
trustworthiness, ratings on the BTI significantly contribute to the prediction of important
leadership outcomes, beyond existing measures of trustworthiness.
31

<-----Page 32----->To examine the predictive validity of the BTI ratings alone, the entry order of the two variables
in both regressions were reversed.

Entering the BTI trust ratings in step 1, R2=.64,

F(1,226)=3094.25, p<.001 for satisfaction in the leader, and R2=.58, F(1,227)=306.54, p<.001
for leader effectiveness. The trustworthiness ratings entered in step 2 significantly accounted
for an additional 7% and 8% of the variance, respectively.
Cross Validation Study
Method
The dimensionality and validity of the BTI was cross validated on a second sample comprised
of 67 leaders and 214 of their direct reports. This sample was drawn from two organizations, a
large public transport company and an energy firm. Different questionnaires were administered
to direct reports and leaders. Direct reports rated their trust in the leader (using the 10 items
from the BTI), their perception of the leader’s trustworthiness (using the short-form of the CTI,
Butler, 1991), the extra effort they put into their work due to the motivating influence of their
leader (assessed by the MLQ, Avolio et al., 1996), the leader’s effectiveness and their
satisfaction with the leader (assessed by the MLQ, Avolio et al., 1996), the frequency of
interaction with the leader (derived from McAllister, 1995), and the duration of the
relationship. Leaders rated their perceptions of the trustworthiness of their direct report (using
the short-form of the CTI, Butler, 1991).
Results
The sample was characterized by high levels of trust, as evidenced by direct reports’ high
willingness to rely on (M = 5.93, SD = .96) and disclose to (M = 5.40, SD = 1.27) their leaders,
and their high ratings of the leaders’ trustworthiness (M = 4.23, SD = .65). Leaders also rated
their direct reports as highly trustworthy (M = 4.21, SD = .69).

Both exploratory and

confirmatory factor analytic techniques supported the hypothesis that behavioral trust is

32

<-----Page 33----->comprised of two distinct dimensions of Reliance and Disclosure (H1). Exploratory factor
analyses replicated the factor structure described in the validation study, with the two factors
defined by the same set of marker variables and accounting for 68% of the variance. Factor
loadings for the marker variables ranged from .78 to .98 (M=.80, SD=.06). Confirmatory factor
analyses also confirmed the two factor model was a good fit to the data (χ2 (32)= 70.52,
CFI=0.98, RMSEA=.075, SRMR=.03, ECVI=.55) and a significantly better fit than a
unidimensional solution, χ2diff (1) =116.44, p<.001. The alpha reliabilities in this sample were
.92 (reliance) and .91 (disclosure).
This cross-validation sample provided further evidence of the convergent validity of the BTI.
A strong relationship was found between subordinates’ ratings of their willingness to rely and
disclose in their leader, with ratings of the leader’s trustworthiness (r=.74, p<.001; r=.71,
p<.001, respectively; H2), the strength of the relationship (H4), including the frequency of
work interaction (r=.25, p<.001; r=.25, p<.001) and social interaction (r=.22, p<.01; r=.37,
p<.001), and the duration of the relationship (r=.18, p<.01, disclosure only), and the extra effort
direct reports put into their work (r=.55, p<.001; r=.47, p<.001; H7). Data from matched
leader-member dyads in the cross-validation sample (ndyads=46) was drawn on to overcome
problems of common method variance. Significant associations were found between leaders’
perception of the trustworthiness of their direct report, and that direct report’s willingness to
both rely on (r=.36, p<.01) and disclose in the leader (r=.53, p<.001).
To test the predictive validity of the BTI in the cross-validation sample, hierarchical linear
regressions were conducted in the same manner as in the validation sample. Table 8 displays
the results. Examining the results for satisfaction with the leader first, the addition of the trust
ratings from the BTI in Step 2 significantly increased R2, ∆R2=.07, Finc (1, 210) = 42.71,
p<.001. Both the leaders’ trustworthiness (β=.44, p<.001) and trust in the leader (β=.42,
p<.001) were positively related to satisfaction with the leader.

trust in the leader (β=.56, p<.001) were positively related to the leader’s effectiveness. The
final R2=.60, F(2, 210)=154.94, p<.001.
Discussion
The Behavioral Trust Inventory is a new, ten-item measure of the willingness to be vulnerable
by engaging in two types of trusting behavior in interpersonal work relationships, namely
reliance and disclosure. The validity of the BTI was supported by interview data, qualitative
survey data, and cross-sectional, longitudinal and matched-dyad quantitative data drawn from
three samples of R&D project staff, and cross-validated on an independent sample of managers
and their direct reports.
Contribution to the Measurement of Interpersonal Trust
The BTI was developed to address a gap in existing trust measures. Whilst existing measures
have contributed significantly to the assessment of trust in organizations, they are limited for
the purpose of assessing trust in leader-member and peer relationships for one or more of the
following reasons; 1) the wording of the items and/or dimensions are not applicable to leadermember and peer relationships, 2) they require further development to obtain adequate
psychometric properties (e.g. reliability), 3) they assess beliefs about another’s trustworthiness
rather than trust, and 4) they mix trust and distrust items, treating low scores on distrust as
equivalent to high trust. The BTI contributes to the literature by offering a brief, valid, and
multidimensional measure that differs from existing measures by its reliable assessment of trust
defined as the willingness to be vulnerable, and its applicability to both leader-member and
peer working relationships. The confirmatory factor analyses (reported in the Discriminant
validity and Cross-validation sections) and the findings from the hierarchical regressions

34

<-----Page 35----->(reported in the Predictive Validity and Cross-Validation sections) both show that the BTI is
empirically distinct from an existing comprehensive measure of trustworthiness, and
significantly adds as much as 13% to the prediction of leadership effectiveness, beyond that
predicted by trustworthiness. Given that much of the current research on interpersonal trust in
organizations operationalize trust through measures of trustworthiness, this finding indicates
that the willingness to engage in trust behavior as measured by the BTI contributes significantly
to the knowledge gained by existing measures.
The Nature of Interpersonal Trust at Work: Personal and Professional Bases
A key theoretical contribution of this study is the finding that trust in work relationships is
predominately manifested through two distinct behaviors; relying on others and disclosing
personal or sensitive information to others. This two dimensional model of trust is consistent
with the view that people choose to trust in some ways but not in others (e.g. Gabarro, 1978;
Lewis & Weigert, 1985). For example, one may be very willing to rely on one’s leader to
represent one’s work to others, but not at all willing to disclose problems in the team to the
leader. Similarly, a team member may be willing to discuss personal difficulties affecting their
work with a sympathetic peer, but unwilling to rely on this peer to complete a job on their
behalf. The significant association between reliance and disclosure indicates, however, that
people are typically more willing to disclose to others whom they feel they can also rely, and
vice versa.
The professional basis of reliance contrasts with the more personally oriented nature of
disclosure and fits the distinction described by several respondents between ‘personal’ and
‘professional’ forms of trust. Disclosure clearly has a stronger emotional and relational basis
than reliance. Sharing personal information or making a disclosure that reveals a vulnerability
often accompanies the formation of interpersonal attachment and expressions of care and
concern. In this way, the disclosure dimension of the BTI is similar to the notion of affective
35

<-----Page 36----->trust, and is consistent with the view that there are components of trust which differ in the
extent to which they are emotionally based (Clark & Payne, 1997; Cummings & Bromiley,
1994; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995). The measurement of Disclosure differs,
however, to previous measures of affective trust by its specific focus on the rater’s willingness
to share sensitive or personal information with another, as opposed to items tapping
reciprocated care and concern that requires the rater to make attributions about the behavior and
emotions of the referent of trust, or items tapping the rater’s emotions towards the referent. In
contrast to disclosure, reliance is anchored more strongly on professional skills, competence
and demonstrated dependability, as is evidenced by the stronger association found in this study
between reliance and satisfaction with performance, than between disclosure and satisfaction
with performance.
It is proposed that the reliance and disclosure dimensions of trust operate in a multiplicative
manner, such that relationships characterised by a willingness to both rely and disclose
represent a higher level and different form of trust, than those characterised by a willingness to
trust in only one domain. Relationships characterized by a willingness to trust in both domains
are proposed to be akin to ‘relational trust,’ where there is a broad base of support, exchange of
resources, interdependence and interpersonal care and concern (Rousseau et al., 1998).
Distinguishing Trust, Trustworthiness and Distrust
This study also makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the distinction between
trust and the related constructs of trustworthiness and distrust. Using structural equation
modeling, it was shown that beliefs about another’s trustworthiness are distinct from, but
significantly associated with, the willingness to be vulnerable by behaving in a trusting manner.
This is consistent with the propositions made in the Integrative Model of Organizational Trust
(Mayer et al., 1995) that trust is conceptually and empirically distinct from trustworthiness and
that trustworthiness is a key predictor of trust. The practical importance of distinguishing trust

36

<-----Page 37----->from trustworthiness is clearly demonstrated by the hierarchical regression analyses which
indicate that both trust and trustworthiness make significant independent contributions to the
prediction of important leadership outcomes. Given the empirical and conceptual distinction
between trustworthiness and trust, evidence of their differential relationships with important
organizational outcomes (reviewed in the section on measurement of trust), and evidence that
each augments the prediction of leadership outcomes, it is recommended that future research
consider including both measures.
The results of this study also speak to a continuing debate in the literature as to whether trust
and distrust are distinct constructs or opposite ends of the same construct (Lewicki et al., 1998).
Although this debate is not new (see Luhmann, 1979), it has to date received only limited
empirical testing (Clark & Payne, 1997; Lewicki et al., 1998). The results of the confirmatory
factor analysis suggest that trust and distrust are indeed distinct constructs.
Differences in Interpersonal Trust in Leader-Member and Peer Relationships
An unexplored question in the trust literature is the extent to which trust operates differently in
leader-member and peer relationships. Three findings from this study suggest that reliance
operates differently in these relationships. First, leaders and team members were more willing
to rely on each other, than team members were willing to rely on their peers. Second, using
data from matched dyads, reliance was found to be weakly reciprocated in leader-member
dyads but not in peer dyads. In contrast, disclosure had a similar mean and was reciprocated to
a similar extent in both leader-member and peer relationships.
An explanation for these two findings lies in the variation in experience, competence and skills
between peers. More experienced or skilled team members are likely to be less willing to rely
on the judgment and performance of a less competent or experienced peer, than vice versa.
Hence, averaging over all peers results in a lower level of, and no clear association between,
peers’ willingness to rely on each other. In leader-member relationships, leaders are usually

37

<-----Page 38----->more experienced and skilled than team members, and have greater access and influence over
organizational resources due to their position. Hence, team members are more willing to rely
on them than their peers. Leaders also usually play a significant role in the selection and
retention of their team members, and are likely to choose and keep members upon whom they
feel they can rely.
If this explanation holds, then one would expect leaders and members to report higher and more
congruent levels of work interdependence in each other than peer dyads. Analyses conducted
on the validation sample supported this expectation.

Leader-member dyads rated their

dependence on each other higher (M=3.4) compared to peer dyads (M=2.5). Leaders’ and
members’ ratings were also significantly correlated (r=.39, p<.01), whereas there was no
association between peers ratings (r=.08, p>.05).
The third finding suggests that in leader-member relationships, feeling comfortable relying on
the other is more important for overall trust, trustworthiness and satisfaction with performance,
than feeling comfortable openly disclosing personal or sensitive information. In contrast, in
peer relationships, feeling comfortable to rely and disclose were of similar importance for these
outcomes. Together these findings provide preliminary support for the view proposed by
Lewis and Weigert (1985), that the comparative strength and importance of different forms of
trust depends on the type of social relationship.
Limitations and Future Research
The BTI is intended for the measurement of trust between leaders, team members and peers in
a range of groups and organizations, and items were specifically chosen for their
generalisability across a range of contexts.

The inventory was developed, however,

predominantly from data collected from members of knowledge-based teams working in a
large multi-division R&D organisation. Whilst the results from the cross-validation study
suggest the BTI is applicable to non-team contexts and other industries and organizations,
38

<-----Page 39----->further research examining the applicability and validity of the BTI in a range of work settings
is called for. In particular, research examining the applicability and validity of the BTI in nonwestern cultural settings and in work settings that have low levels of trust is required. Whilst
the two factor model of trust may generalize across work settings, the specific behaviors that
best represent the willingness to rely and disclose may vary depending on the context (e.g.
industry, functional role), warranting some adaptation of the items.
As Dirks & Ferrin (2002) note, there has been little research examining and comparing multiple
dimensions of trust in the same study. This study has identified differences in the way the
reliance and disclosure dimensions of trust relate to other variables and are reciprocated in peer
relationships. Further exploration of potential differences in the antecedents and consequences
of the reliance and disclosure dimensions, and how they operate in different types of
relationships (e.g. leader-member vs peer) is required to further our understanding of these
forms of trust.

One such line of future enquiry is to explore the relationship between

components of trustworthiness (e.g. ability, integrity and benevolence) and the two dimensions
of trust. For example, given the more ability-based nature of reliance compared to the more
relationship-based nature of disclosure, it may be that beliefs about another’s ability will be a
stronger determinant of the willingness to rely on that person, whereas beliefs about another’s
benevolence will be a stronger determinant of the willingness to openly share information with
that person. Another important unexplored question is how group and organizational norms
influence the willingness to rely and disclose in work relationships.
A limitation of this study is the small sample of leaders in both the validation (n=77) and crossvalidation (n=67) studies. Examination of the dimensionality and validity of the BTI on a
larger sample of leaders is recommended. Research examining the BTI’s ability to predict
actual trust behavior, using either longitudinal, laboratory, or semi-controlled field studies is
also recommended to more rigorously assess the predictive validity of the instrument.

39

<-----Page 40----->Conclusion
In summary, given the solid psychometric properties of the inventory, strong evidence of its
content, convergent and discriminant validity, and its congruence with the most widely
accepted definition of trust, the BTI promises to be a useful tool for assessing interpersonal
trust in work relationships.
