a b s t r a c t
The present investigation explores the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of social inﬂuence on
preferences. We socially tagged symbols as valued or not – by exposing participants to the preferences
of their peers – and assessed subsequent brain activity during an incidental processing task in which participants viewed popular, unpopular, and novel symbols. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) differentiated between symbols that were and were not socially tagged – a possible index of normative inﬂuence –
while aspects of the striatum (the caudate) differentiated between popular and unpopular symbols – a
possible index of informational inﬂuence. These results suggest that integrating activity in these two
brain regions may differentiate objects that have become valued as a result of social inﬂuence from those
valued for non-social reasons.

The iconic Lacoste green crocodile logo – initially created in
honor of the 1920s French tennis star Rene Lacoste – has waxed
and waned in popularity over the years, enjoying enormous popularity in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s while
nearly disappearing from sight in the 1990s, only to reemerge in
this decade as a desired status symbol. One reason to buy clothing
featuring this crocodile might be to emulate Lacoste himself, of
course, but we would be surprised if American teenagers have
any awareness of the origins of the logo. Instead, such trends are
often driven by the adoption – and rejection – of products by others: The value of little green crocodiles depends critically on the
value that others attach to that symbol.
In this paper, we model the process by which social inﬂuence
impacts preferences in a 1-h experimental session, using a paradigm
in which we train participants to see symbols as socially valued or
not by providing them with feedback about the preferences of others. We then examine the impact of this social feedback on the brain
activity that participants exhibit while viewing objects that have
been endorsed or rejected by their peers, exploring the neural processes underlying changes in valuation due to social inﬂuence.

others has become nearly axiomatic across the social sciences; the
sheer number of terms used to describe this process is indicative of
its ubiquity, from social inﬂuence to social proof to peer pressure
to bandwagon effects to conformity to herding (Abrahamson,
1991; Asch, 1951; Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, &
Welch, 1992; see Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004; Sherif, 1936, for a
review). Indeed, even non-human primates are quick to adhere to
social norms (Whiten, Horner, & de Waal, 2005). The impact of social
inﬂuence has been demonstrated in countless domains, including
pain perception (Craig & Prkachin, 1978), littering (Cialdini, Reno,
& Kallgren, 1990), voting (Gerber, Green, & Larimer, 2008), donating
to charities (Reingen, 1982), expressing prejudice (Apfelbaum, Sommers, & Norton, 2008), choosing jobs (Higgins, 2001; Kilduff, 1990),
investing in the stock market (Hong, Kubik, & Stein, 2004), and, most
relevant to the current investigation, both adoption and rejection of
consumer products (Berger & Heath, 2007). Judgment and decisionmaking researchers have also increasingly recognized the fundamental impact of social factors on human behavior: Investigations
of such ‘‘social decision-making” (Sanfey, 2007) have the potential
to speed the integration of psychologists with both neuroscientists
and game theorists, offering a more complete account of human
decision-making (Camerer, 2003).
From an early stage in research exploring the effects of social
factors on behavior, researchers focused their attention on a fundamental question: the extent to which behavior inﬂuenced by peers
indicated a true change in attitude such that social inﬂuence changed people’s minds, or merely a desire to be publically consistent
with the viewpoints of others. Following on Asch’s (1951) classic

<-----Page 1----->M.F. Mason et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 152–159

conformity studies, in which participants gave obviously wrong
answers to a simple line judgment task when confederates had given those wrong answers before them, Deutsch and Gerard (1955)
varied whether responses to such tasks were visible to others or
not; they showed that conformity was at its highest when
responses were public – due to what they termed normative inﬂuence – but that even responses given in private could be inﬂuenced
by the behavior of others – what they termed informational inﬂuence. In this and subsequent investigations, the extent to which
behavior was inﬂuenced by true changes in belief as opposed to
public desires to conform was inferred by comparing behavior
inﬂuenced only by private factors (anonymous behavior) from
behavior inﬂuenced by both private and public factors; subtracting
the former from the latter results in the amount of private attitude
change. While this strategy is experimentally elegant, the ideal evidence for this theory would be to assess the underpinnings of normative and informational inﬂuence simultaneously.
Brain imaging research offers just this potential. One of the key
theoretical questions lingering from Asch’s initial investigation, for
example, was whether participants were merely conforming to the
confederate’s answers, or whether they came to literally see the
wrong answers as correct. In a recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigation of conformity in which confederates gave false answers to a mental rotation task, Berns et al.
(2005) demonstrated that the erroneous responses of others altered activity in brain regions implicated in mental rotation, suggesting not just a social impact of conformity pressures, but a
true change in perception (see Sherif, 1936). These results offer evidence that social inﬂuence can be indexed at the level of the brain,
and suggest that examining different regions known to be implicated in different processes may be a fruitful avenue to examine
two-factor theories of social inﬂuence.
While the research reviewed above has focused primarily on
conformity to tasks (line judgments and mental rotations), we
use brain imaging to explore these dynamics in the domain of preferences, examining how the brain responds when participants are
confronted by symbols that they previously learned were socially
valued or socially rejected by others. In the spirit of previous studies on social inﬂuence, we consider both normative and informational aspects of such pressures, assessing brain activity in (a)
regions involved with processing the opinions and mental states
of others – the normative aspects of social inﬂuence and (b) regions
implicated in experienced utility or reward – the informational
aspects of social inﬂuence.
Neural mechanisms of social inﬂuence
Normative inﬂuence
We expected the processing of ‘‘socially tagged” objects – objects about which participants had seen others express an opinion
(i.e., endorse or reject) – to be associated with signiﬁcantly greater
activity in regions that play a role in representing and decoding the
mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires and preferences) of other people.
A large body of neuroimaging research points to the central role of
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in intuiting other people’s
mental states and in social thinking more generally (for reviews
see Amodio & Frith, 2006; Blakemore & Decety, 2001; Gallagher &
Frith, 2003; Mason & Macrae, 2008). For example, enhanced activity
in this region has been detected when people consider the motivations underlying other’s actions (de Lange, Spronk, Willems, Toni, &
Bekkering, 2008; Mason, Banﬁeld, & Macrae, 2004), their feelings
(Ochsner et al., 2004), and their fears (Olsson, Nearing, & Phelps,
2007). The region is also active when people reﬂect on the impression they have made on others (Izuma, Saito, & Sadato, 2008). Particularly relevant to the present investigation is fMRI evidence that

153

the mPFC plays a role in the processing of social norms, including
perceiving norm violations (Berthoz, Armony, Blair, & Dolan,
2002) and experiencing embarrassment or guilt for the social norm
transgressions of others (Takahashi et al., 2004). Dovetailing with
these brain imaging ﬁndings is neuropsychological evidence that
patients with damage to regions of the mPFC exhibit social disinhibition due to a lack of awareness or concern for social norms (Beer,
Heerey, Keltner, Scabini, & Knight, 2003; Eisenberg, 2000).
Taken together, previous research suggests that the mPFC plays
a central role in representing and processing information about the
beliefs, attitudes and feelings of other people. We therefore predicted that people would exhibit greater recruitment of the mPFC
when exposed to objects that they had learned were socially valued and devalued, compared to objects that had not been similarly
socially tagged.
Informational inﬂuence
We also explored whether social inﬂuence impacts the experienced utility – the reward value – of socially tagged objects. Brain
imaging research (Delgado, Nystrom, Fissell, Noll, & Fiez, 2000;
Elliott, Friston, & Dolan, 2000; Knutson, Adams, Fong, & Hommer,
2001; McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, & Cohen, 2004a; O’Doherty,
Deichmann, Critchley, & Dolan, 2002) and electrophysiological
work with non-human primates (Schultz, Apicella, Scarnati, &
Ljungberg, 1992; Tremblay, Hollerman, & Schultz, 1998) converge
on a central role of the striatum – the nucleus accumbens (nACC),
putamen, and caudate – in representing the value of primary reinforcers, or stimuli with inherent reward such as cocaine, but also
secondary reinforcers, stimuli that are rewarding by association
or that have acquired value through acculturation, such as art
(Vartanian & Goel, 2004). Thus striatal regions are active not just
when people view inherently attractive faces (Aharon et al.,
2001), but also when they view their signiﬁcant other, whether
conventionally attractive or not (Aron et al., 2005).
Particularly relevant to the present investigation is recent evidence that recruitment of these regions is impacted by exposure
to products that people have come to value as the result of marketing actions, even holding the objective utility of those objects constant. For instance, people exhibit signiﬁcantly greater activity in
reward regions when they consume a wine they believe to be
expensive relative to when they consume that same wine priced
more modestly (Plassman, O’Doherty, Shiv, & Rangel, 2008) due
to their having learned the general rule that price is a signal of
quality (Rao & Monroe, 1989). In addition, reward regions are more
active when people consume drinks that they believe are made by
a company whose brand they have learned to value than when
they consume that same drink under a different brand name (McClure et al., 2004b). These results suggest that reward regions code
not only for the inherent value of a product but also for the utility
from learned associations like price and brand information. While
both price and brand are in part socially constructed – people’s
preferences for expensive branded products is likely related to
their desire for social utility – we explore whether these cortical
areas are sensitive to value created solely and speciﬁcally from
learning the opinions of others. Thus while we predicted that activity in the mPFC would track with whether objects had been socially
tagged or not, we predicted that activity in reward areas such as the
striatum (nACC, putamen, and caudate) would vary as a function of
the valence of that tagging – whether participants had learned that
objects were socially valued or not.
Overview of the experiment
Prior to collecting functional imaging data, we exposed participants to information about others’ preferences for abstract sym-

<-----Page 2----->154

bols in a ‘‘social inﬂuence” phase. During this phase, participants
learned that some symbols were ‘‘popular” (preferred by others
on 90% of trials) while others were ‘‘unpopular” (preferred on just
10% of trials). We then assessed brain activity using fMRI when
people were exposed to these socially tagged (popular and unpopular) symbols, as well as new symbols about which they had not
been provided social information. We expected that regions implicated in social processing (mPFC) and reward (striatum, including
nACC, putamen, and caudate) would be differentially active
depending both on whether symbols had been socially tagged
and on the valence of that tagging.
Method
Participants and design
Twelve male participants from a university community completed the experiment for course credit or monetary compensation.
All participants were strongly right-handed as measured by the
Edinburgh handedness inventory (Raczkowski, Kalat, & Nebes,
1974), reported no signiﬁcant abnormal neurological history, and
had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity.
The experiment had a single factor (symbol type: popular,
unpopular, new) repeated-measures design. Each participant completed a pre-scanning ‘‘social inﬂuence” phase and was then
scanned while performing a delayed match-to-sample task with
the three symbol types as target items.
Stimulus materials
We selected 30 abstract symbols for use in the experiment (see
Fig. 1A and B for examples). Of the 30 symbols, we randomly
selected twenty for use in the pre-scanning portion of the

experiment – 10 to be tagged as popular and 10 to be tagged as
unpopular. The remaining 10 were used as new symbols and thus
were not seen by participants until they performed the delayed
match-to-sample task while in the fMRI magnet.
We also created a set of 200 faces to use in the pre-scanning
‘‘social inﬂuence” phase.
Pre-scanning phase: instantiating social inﬂuence
Participants were told that hundreds of people had been asked
to make preference judgments on pairs of abstract symbols, and
that they would see pictures of these people accompanied by a
visual depiction of the choice each of these people made (see
Fig. 1A). Participants were asked to form an impression of which
symbols were liked by which individuals, and were told that,
though they would not explicitly be tested on the information, it
was important for them to pay close attention to the task.
During this ‘‘social inﬂuence” phase, symbols from the popular
set were depicted as being chosen (as indicated by a green box that
appeared around the chosen symbol) 90% of the time, while symbols from the unpopular set were depicted as being chosen 10%
of the time. On half of the trials the chosen item appeared on the
left-hand side of the screen while on the other half, the chosen
item appeared on the right. This design allowed us to control for
familiarity – popular and unpopular symbols were presented with
the same frequency – and manipulate only the social value
attached to those symbols, by varying only which symbol was
highlighted.
Participants completed a total of 200 trials that lasted 2500 ms
in duration. Each trial began with a face – randomly selected from
the set of 200 – displayed at the center of the screen. After 750 ms,
two symbols appeared below the face; a green box indicating the
person’s preferred symbol appeared around one of the symbols

screen. At 500 ms, the ﬁxation cross was replaced by a target face. At 1250 ms, two symbols appeared on the screen below the face. One of the symbols – the target’s preferred
symbol – was surrounded by a green box. The face and the symbols remained on the screen for 1250 ms until the end of the trial. (B) Timeline depicting an fMRI experimental
run. Participants pressed the button when they saw the same symbol depicted twice in a row (delayed match-to-sample task). To tease apart the signal associated with each

generates and includes in the model. The general linear model
was used to compute parameter estimates (b) and t-contrast
images for each comparison at each voxel. These individual
contrast images were then submitted to a second-level, randomeffects analysis to obtain mean t-images.

Scanning phase: assessing social inﬂuence
Results
Participants were told that they would see symbols – some that
they had seen previously, some new – appear at the center of the
screen, interspersed with ﬁxation crosses, and that their task was
to press the button when they saw the same symbol twice in a
row, a standard delayed match-to-sample task.
Participants were scanned in two event-related functional (EPI)
runs. To bring the spin system into a steady state, four dummy
shots were acquired at the start of each of the two runs. A total
of 147 volumes were collected within each EPI run. Each experimental trial lasted for a total of 2500 ms. Trials were pseudo-randomized within each of the two runs and the run order
presentation was counterbalanced across participants (see
Fig. 1B). In each of the two EPI runs, participants saw new symbols
on 36 trials, popular symbols on 27 trials, and unpopular symbols
on 27 trials. Nine of these 90 trials – or 10% – involved symbol
repeats (participants seeing the same symbol two trials in a row)
and thus elicited button responses from the participants. The
remaining 57 EPI volumes were jittered catch trials (i.e., ﬁxation
symbols, ‘‘+”) used to optimize estimation of the event-related
BOLD response. The stimuli were presented using PsyScope (version 1.2.5) and back projected with an Epson (ELP-7000) LCD projector onto a screen at the end of the magnet bore that participants
viewed by way of a mirror mounted on the head coil. Pillow and
foam cushions were placed within the head coil to minimize head
movements.
Image acquisition
All images were collected using a 1.5T GE Signa scanner with
standard head coil. T1- weighted anatomical images were collected
using a 3D sequence (SPGR; 128 sagittal slices, TR = 7 ms,
TE = 3 ms, prep time = 315 ms, ﬂip angle = 15°, FOV = 24 cm, slice
thickness = 1.2 mm, matrix = 256  192). Functional images were
collected with a gradient echo EPI sequence (each volume comprised 25 slices; 4.5 mm thick, 1 mm skip; TR = 2500 ms,
TE = 35 ms, FOV = 24 cm, 64  64 matrix; 90° ﬂip angle).
fMRI analysis
Functional MRI data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric
Mapping software (SPM5, Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; Friston et al., 1995). For each functional run,
data were pre-processed to remove sources of noise and artifact.
Pre-processing included slice timing and motion correction, coregistration to each participant’s anatomical data, normalization to
the ICBM 152 brain template (Montreal Neurological Institute),
and spatial smoothing with an 8 mm (full-width-at-half-maximum) Gaussian kernel. Analyses took place at two levels: formation of statistical images and regional analysis of hemodynamic
responses.
For each participant, a general linear model with 8 regressors
was speciﬁed. The model included regressors specifying the three
conditions of interest – popular, unpopular, and new symbols
(modeled with functions for the hemodynamic response) – a
fourth regressor modeling the button responses/repeat trials
(modeled with functions for the hemodynamic response), a ﬁfth
regressor to distinguish between the two EPI runs (modeled with
a constant), two regressors modeling scanner drift (modeled as
linear trends), and the constant term that SPM automatically

Pilot behavioral study
To conﬁrm that our social tagging manipulation impacted liking
for the symbols, we conducted a behavioral version of the pre-scanning social inﬂuence phase described above, in which participants
(N = 32) rated all symbols on a 5-point scale both before and after
the social inﬂuence phase. To measure the change in liking as a result
of the manipulation, we calculated differences scores by subtracting
pre-ratings from post-ratings, such that positive numbers indicate
an increase in liking and negative numbers a decrease. As expected,
popular symbols were rated signiﬁcantly higher after the social
inﬂuence phase than before (Mdifference = .39, SD = .82), t(31) = 2.67,
p < .02, while attitudes towards unpopular symbols showed a marSD = .82),

p < .001.
fMRI analyses – direct comparisons
To identify brain regions that were sensitive to stimuli that had
previously been socially tagged, we conducted a direct contrast between symbols that were viewed during the social inﬂuence phase
– both popular and unpopular – compared to the new symbols that
had not been socially tagged. A single cluster in an aspect of the
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; BA10 exhibited signiﬁcantly
greater activity (p < .001; k = 10) when participants viewed symbols which had been socially tagged relative to when they viewed
new symbols (Table 1). The opposite contrast – comparing new to
socially tagged symbols – revealed signiﬁcantly greater activity
(p < .001; k = 10) in a cluster that spanned the right superior occipital gyrus and precuneus (BAs7, 19, 31).
Next, we explored differences in brain activity speciﬁcally between popular and unpopular symbols. Results of a direct comparison between these two conditions revealed signiﬁcantly greater
activity in the right caudate – part of the striatum – when participants viewed popular relative to unpopular symbols (p < .001,
k = 10; Table 2). The opposite contrast – unpopular symbols > popular symbols – revealed no cortical regions that exhibited greater
signal to unpopular symbols at the same threshold.

ROI analysis demonstrated that activity in the right caudate was

observed in this area, t(11) < 1, ns (Fig. 2). Results obtained in our
pilot behavioral study demonstrated that participants liked popular symbols more than unpopular symbols after the social inﬂuence phase; results from the brain imaging portion of the
experiment – which allow us to compare reward value for popular
and unpopular symbols to reward value for novel symbols – suggest that this difference in ratings that emerged in the behavioral
study was driven more by a decrease in the value of unpopular
shapes than an increase in the value of popular shapes.

General discussion
Region of interest (ROI) analyses
To explore our effects further, we conducted follow-up ROI
analyses, by building and dropping 10 mm spheres over the coordinates of interest, extracting the percent signal change with the
tools provided by the SPM5 MarsBar utility (Brett, Anton, Valabregue, & Poline, 2002) for each of the conditions in each ROI, and then
averaging these values across all participants.
We ﬁrst examined the difference in recruitment of mPFC we
observed in the direct comparison of symbols from the social inﬂuence phase – both popular and unpopular – to the new symbols that
had not been socially tagged. As is characteristic of this brain area
(Shulman et al., 1997), the ROI analysis revealed that mPFC results
were driven by a difference in signal decrease relative to baseline
(Fig. 2). The signal in this region decreased signiﬁcantly less to
socially tagged symbols than to new symbols, t(11) = 3.35, p < .01.
Next, we explored the difference in recruitment of the caudate
we had observed between popular and unpopular symbols. The

We explored the neural mechanisms of social inﬂuence, examining how manipulating the popularity of abstract symbols – our
rough proxy for the kinds of stimuli that are socially tagged in
the real world, like the Lacoste crocodile – impacted brain activity
when viewing those symbols.
As expected, mPFC, a brain region involved in thinking about
the attitudes and preferences of others (see Amodio &Frith,
2006), was more active when participants viewed symbols that
had been socially tagged than symbols for which they had no prior
social information, suggesting a possible index of normative inﬂuence at the level of the brain. Interestingly, activity in this region
did not differentiate between popular and unpopular symbols,
but rather only between socially tagged and new symbols. This
suggests that this area plays a general role in tracking whether
preferences are socially relevant or not; indeed, knowing whether
an item is disliked by one’s peers is as important as knowing
whether an item is liked. Also as predicted, we found that a region
involved in the experience of reward – the caudate, part of the

striatum – exhibited greater activity in response to popular symbols relative to unpopular symbols, providing a possible index of
informational inﬂuence at the level of the brain.
These results suggest that predicting whether a symbol is
socially valued may require integrating data from both the mPFC
and the caudate. Looking solely at the mPFC reveals only whether
a symbol is socially tagged or not, while looking solely at the caudate reveals only whether a symbol is liked or disliked; only by
looking at both regions together can we identify those symbols
that have become valued as a result of social inﬂuence. These
results – demonstrating both social and primary reward components of social inﬂuence – hearken back to, and reinforce, the distinction between informational and normative inﬂuence
highlighted in early models of conformity (Asch, 1951; Deutsch &
Gerard, 1955).
Although activity in the caudate distinguished between symbols that were popular and unpopular, it is worth highlighting
the nature of this difference. Results of our ROI analyses indicated
that the signal discrepancy was largely driven by an attenuation of
activity in the caudate when participants encountered unpopular
symbols; no signiﬁcant difference between new and popular symbols emerged in this region. First, these results address one critique
of the experimental paradigm that we employed in the present
investigation. It is possible that by highlighting popular objects
in the social inﬂuence phase, we drew participants’ attention to
popular symbols more than to unpopular symbols, an account that
would imply that responses to unpopular symbols – those that
participants ignored and thus were not exposed to – would be similar to those of new symbols; these results, however, suggest this is
not the case.
These results also imply that the caudate may be more attuned
to information about what is rejected than what is preferred by
others, a ﬁnding with important implications for researchers of
consumer behavior. First, this attunement may translate into an
asymmetry in the rate at which people come to exhibit a preference for a socially endorsed item and the rate at which people
come to reject a socially undesirable item, which can inform existing models of product adoption and abandonment (Rogers, 1962).
Second, marketers are increasingly relying on social networks as
part of the marketing mix, as evidenced by the increased popularity of word-of-mouth consulting services such as BzzAgent and
similar in-house services such as Proctor and Gamble’s Tremor.
Most of these campaigns take the form of social endorsement of
products, rather than denigration of competing products, a strategy
which our results suggest may not be as impactful. More broadly,
assessing the effectiveness of such social networking campaigns
is notoriously difﬁcult, since the recipient of word-of-mouth can
wait for days, weeks, or even months before making a purchase.
Our results suggest that marketers might bring consumers into
an imaging session and expose them to products, using activity
in reward regions (such as the caudate) to assess pure liking but
also using activity in mPFC to assess the extent to which those
products have been socially tagged or not – a novel metric for
the effectiveness of word-of-mouth marketing.
We have focused on two particular functions of the mPFC and
caudate – in representing social information and reward, respectively – but both regions of course subserve a number of other
functions. Most salient as an alternative account for our brain
imaging results, both regions consistently exhibit greater BOLD
activity during easy versus difﬁcult tasks. The mPFC has been
shown to be more active when people engage in tasks with minimal processing demands (Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, & Schacter,
2008; Gusnard & Raichle, 2001; McKiernan, Kaufman, KuceraThompson, & Binder, 2003; Shulman et al., 1997) such as overlearned button press tasks (Mason et al., 2007); if processing
socially tagged symbols is easier than processing new symbols,

157

then our mPFC results might be an artifact of task difﬁculty. Similarly, some research points to a role for the caudate in the control
and coordination of movements, including learning the relationship between a triggering stimuli and its appropriate response
(e.g., Seger & Cincotta, 2006); if learning about popular symbols
is easier than learning about unpopular symbols, then our caudate
results might be an artifact of this form of task difﬁculty.
We believe this alternative explanation is unlikely to account
for our results for two reasons. First, from a methodological standpoint, the task participants performed in the imaging portion of the
experiment was minimally demanding across all types of symbols,
consisting primarily of passively viewing symbols and responding
with a button press on only a small percentage (10%) of the trials.
Indeed, button press response times did not differ across the three
symbol types (Munpopular = 881 ms, Mpopular = 865 ms, Mnew =
884 ms), F(2, 30) < 1, suggesting that the symbols elicited similar
levels of processing effort. Second, we observe differences in caudate recruitment between popular and unpopular symbols, but
no difference in mPFC recruitment between these two types of
symbols: If task difﬁculty underlies caudate differences between
popular and unpopular symbols, we might expect to observe similar differences in mPFC recruitment for these two types of symbols, but do not (Fig. 2). Following the same logic, if differences
in mPFC recruitment between socially tagged and novel symbols
are due to task difﬁculty, we might expect to observe similar differences in caudate recruitment, but again do not (Fig. 2). Thus while
we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that task difﬁculty
accounts for our effects, the pattern of results elicited by the three
symbol types across the caudate and mPFC more closely matches
our account.
Finally, we have drawn sharp distinctions between normative
and informational inﬂuence throughout this paper, and stressed
the speciﬁcity of the brain regions underlying these different forms
of social inﬂuence. In practice, of course, these two kinds of inﬂuence are frequently interlinked (opinions expressed to conform
to the attitudes of others can over time become internalized preferences, for example), and the brain regions underlying these processes likely work in concert as well. Indeed, the fact that we
observe activation in the caudate as opposed to other reward-related regions such as the nucleus accumbens points to the possible
interrelatedness of the systems: Several recent investigations have
provided evidence for a role of the striatum in representing reward
that is socially derived (see Sanfey, 2007). King-Casas et al. (2005),
for example, demonstrated that the expectation of fair treatment
from an interaction partner in an ultimatum game was associated
with increased activity in the caudate (see also Fliessbach et al.,
2007; Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Similarly, some evidence suggests that aspects of the mPFC may be involved in coding
for reward (e.g., Amodio & Frith, 2006; McClure, Caibson et al.,
2004a). Izuma et al. (2008) provide evidence of the separable but
interrelated roles of caudate and mPFC: In their investigation,
activity in the caudate tracked with the magnitude of both social
and monetary reward, but the mPFC was selectively activated
when participants processed feedback about the impression they
made on others, regardless of valence.
Like our investigation which modeled the formation of social
preferences in a time-limited laboratory session, these other investigations are similarly short in duration, precluding an exploration
of the time course of the interplay of brain regions over time. Future research should explore the process by which learning the
attitudes of other people translates into stable preferences in
memory: Brain regions involved in episodic and short-term memory might play a dominant role during early stages of the social
inﬂuence process, while regions involved in storing semantic, general knowledge about the world might be more involved as those
novel preferences become more stable. One intriguing possibility

<-----Page 6----->158

would be to explore a role for areas of the right hippocampus
implicated speciﬁcally in memory for social information (e.g.,
Kirwan & Stark, 2004; Somerville, Wig, Whalen, & Kelley, 2006).
Conclusions
We close by highlighting how the minimalistic nature of our
paradigm speaks to the robustness of the power of social inﬂuence.
First, we observed our effects – greater recruitment of the mPFC to
socially tagged symbols and greater caudate activity to popular
symbols – despite the fact that participants were never explicitly
directed to judge the symbols during the scanning session, instead
performing an incidental processing task. This suggests that the
impact of social inﬂuence is present and detectable even in the absence of any conscious intention on the part of the participant to
consider the value of the target item (e.g., ‘‘Do I like this symbol?’)
or any instruction to consider the previous social context in which
this information was encountered (e.g., ‘‘How popular was this
symbol?”). These results are particularly notable in light of previous evidence that relevant norms must be salient to elicit normcongruent behavior (Cialdini, Kallgren, & Reno, 1991). Second,
our effects emerged at the level of the brain after just a short training duration, involving abstract symbols tagged by the opinions of
strangers, and in a setting that was decidedly not naturalistic (an
MR scanner). We can only imagine the magnitude of our effects
in more familiar contexts, using more meaningful stimuli, and
involving social tagging by non-strangers, all important areas for
future research.
