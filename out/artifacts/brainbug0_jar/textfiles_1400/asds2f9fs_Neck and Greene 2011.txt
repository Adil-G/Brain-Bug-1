Entrepreneurship Education: Known Worlds
and New Frontiers
jsbm_314 55..70

by Heidi M. Neck and Patricia G. Greene

We explore three “worlds” that entrepreneurship educators generally teach in and
introduce a new frontier where we discuss teaching entrepreneurship as a method.
The method is a way of thinking and acting, built on a set of assumptions using a
portfolio of techniques to create. It goes beyond understanding, knowing, and talking
and requires using, applying, and acting. At the core of the method is the ability for
students to practice entrepreneurship and we introduce a portfolio of practice-based
pedagogies. These include starting businesses as coursework, serious games and
simulations, design-based thinking, and reflective practice.

Introduction
Entrepreneurship is complex, chaotic,
and lacks any notion of linearity. As educators, we have the responsibility to
develop the discovery, reasoning, and
implementation skills of our students so
they may excel in highly uncertain environments. These skills enhance the likelihood that our students will identify and
capture the right opportunity at the right
time for the right reason. However, this
is a significant responsibility and challenge. The current approaches to entrepreneurship education are based on a
world of yesterday—a world where precedent was the foundation for future

action, where history often did predict
the future. Yet, entrepreneurship is
about creating new opportunities and
executing in uncertain and even currently unknowable environments. Entrepreneurship
and
entrepreneurship
education have more relevance today
than ever before.
For many years, it was popular to ask,
“Can entrepreneurship be taught?” As
educators, we always said, “yes, of
course” and went on to list the myriad of
reasons rehearsed in advance of such
questions. Our answers might include, “it
is a skill set,” or “we have been doing it
for years,” or “it depends what you mean
by entrepreneurship.” In reality and

<-----Page 1----->upon reflection in looking at the future
of entrepreneurship education, we may
be willing to admit that we were wrong
and willing to consider alternative explanations. Might it be that entrepreneurship, using current popular approaches,
cannot really be taught and that realworld experience actually does supersede an expensive college education?
Just look at Bill Gates, Steve Jobs,
Richard Branson, Mary Kay Ash, and
Debbie Fields who are all incredibly successful entrepreneurs without a college
degree. Should their success signal anything to entrepreneurship educators? Not
really. For every Bill Gates, there are a
million entrepreneurs who experience
“in the real world” dramatic, life-altering
failure that we do not read about in the
popular press.
We know what you are thinking. First,
we say entrepreneurship cannot be
taught. Then we suggest that experience
supersedes education. Finally, we say
ignore Bill, Steve, Richard, Mary Kay,
and Debbie—the kings and queens of
learning entrepreneurship outside the
ivory tower of the academy. Confused?
Our confusion is intentional to illustrate
where we are as educators in the
dynamic, cross-disciplinary field of entrepreneurship. The academic field and
practical field of entrepreneurship have
consistently been at odds throughout the
years, but such conflict has led to a rich
and diverse pool of collaborative
educators—academics,
entrepreneurs,
consultants, investors, full-time, parttime, academically qualified, and professionally qualified—with a common
understanding that entrepreneurship
education is important. Across the field,
there are differences in how we
approach teaching entrepreneurship.
Given the multidisciplinary field of
entrepreneurship, the content covered in
most entrepreneurship courses is farreaching. An entrepreneurship educator
is often expected to know everything
about every field. It is not uncommon to

56

teach aspects of strategy, finance, law,
human resources, leadership, marketing,
accounting, operations, and ethics in any
given class. The next class might offer
perspectives from sociology, anthropology, and business history. This is at a
time when those in the discipline of
entrepreneurship
also
strive
for
increased legitimacy as an academic
field, pushing for the research rigor that
some suggest drives intellectual maturity
(Brush et al. 2003). As a field, entrepreneurship essentially covers prestart-up
and beyond, from intellectual property to
initial public offering. Though the field
of entrepreneurship has progressed
beyond evaluating and describing the
entrepreneur as the lone maverick with
superhero powers, the entrepreneur is
nonetheless a central figure in the emerging stages of business creation. As such,
entrepreneurship educators also teach
foundation principles, often considered
“the soft stuff,” of living with uncertainty,
opportunity identification, entrepreneurial mindset, creating, decision-making,
developing empathy, business design,
culture, life–work balance, social responsibility, and leveraging failure. The marriage of all of these content areas is value
creation and capture entrepreneurship as
an engine to create economic, social, and
personal value. For many students of
entrepreneurship, whereas their peers
are pursuing careers, they are pursuing a
life path. It looks different, it feels different; it is different—especially in today’s
global environment.
The purpose of this paper is to
present a framework for teaching in a
new world. We advance the concept of
teaching entrepreneurship as a method,
which is in contrast to the current
ways—the known worlds—in which we
are currently teaching entrepreneurship.
We are not proposing a particular pedagogy. If anything, we would firmly fall in
Forest and Peterson’s (2006) andragogy
camp anyway. On the contrary, we are
proposing an entirely different approach

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

<-----Page 2----->to teaching entrepreneurship. We are
proposing an overarching framework for
teaching entrepreneurship that will
require many different approaches to
teaching and learning—some of which
have not yet been discovered or created.
We are proposing that teaching entrepreneurship requires teaching a method.
The method is teachable, learnable, but it
is not predictable. The method is peopledependent but not dependent on a type
of person. The entrepreneurship method
goes beyond understanding, knowing,
and talking and demands using, applying, and acting. Most importantly the
method requires practice. Entrepreneurship requires practice. Learning a
method, we believe, is often more important than learning specific content. In an
ever-changing world, we need to teach
methods that stand the test of dramatic
changes in content and context.
We introduce this method in light of
other current approaches to teaching
entrepreneurship.

The Known Worlds of
Entrepreneurship
Education
We present three different approaches
used to teach entrepreneurship. Some
educators rely on one approach, whereas
others incorporate two or even all
approaches. Though it is tempting to
think our worlds represent the evolution
of the field, we do not think of them
strictly in chronological order and recognize that each of these approaches is
being used in classrooms today.

The Entrepreneur World
We have already acknowledged the
importance of the entrepreneur in this
field of study. A large amount of literature has developed around the “traits”
approach, much of it starting with the
economic development work of David
McClelland (1965). Even today, researchers around the world continue to search

for the monolithic personality of the
entrepreneur. Brockhaus and Horwitz
(1986) reviewed the early trait literature
and concluded that there are four major
personality traits of individuals: need for
achievement, internal locus of control,
high risk-taking propensity, and tolerance for ambiguity. Ten years later,
Miner (1996) proposed four psychological personality patterns of entrepreneurs:
personal advisors, empathetic super
salespeople, real managers, and expert
idea generators. Also, most recently,
Shane posited the role of the entrepreneurial gene, taking the nature versus
nurture discussion to new extremes
(Mount 2010). Any discussion of the
numerous challenges in this trait line of
research can range from problems with
defining (who is an entrepreneur and
who are we picking to represent “successful” entrepreneurs), differentiating
and explaining (these are traits of successful people in many lines of work) to
prediction (do we all not wish we could
pick the winners)?
In this world, the entrepreneur reigns
supreme with almost superhero characteristics. We can consider this approach
from three perspectives. First, though it
is easy to consider this an early world of
entrepreneurship, this is not a timebound discussion. Bill Gartner (1988)
gave us a notable moment of punctuated
equilibrium that prompted many in the
field to move beyond traits, but it is hard
to let go. We are also sure that you still
hear, as we do, the “you cannot teach
entrepreneurship” mantra at many of the
more practitioner-oriented programs you
give or attend. Despite our introduction
to this essay, we do beg to differ. After
all, this same question has been asked
about both leaders and teachers (Quinn
and Anding 2005).
A second consideration of entrepreneurial content in this world is the fact
that most of the characteristics studied
were identified in research projects in
which the samples were entirely white

NECK AND GREENE

57

<-----Page 3----->males. Methodologically, it is hard to
support any sort of generalization from
that, and none of our worlds of entrepreneurship are exclusively males.
Third, this world, especially in the
early days, uses a quite narrow definition
of success—one that is entirely economically based. It is anchored in the smallest
definition of entrepreneurship, the creation of a small business, even if it is one
that is intended to grow. As Giacalone
(2004) reminded us, “Teaching students
to use the single-minded materialistic
value system distorts the reality of daily
life, were we routinely assimilate nonmaterialistic goals” (p. 416). The finding
that entrepreneurs are motivated by
more than money is long-standing and
quite robust across studies, and yet, we
rarely tie the motivation to the entrepreneurs’ own definitions of success.
The entrepreneur is the champion in
this world. On the delivery side, as teachers, we use a variety of entrepreneurial
assessments, self-examinations, the “do
you have the right stuff” approach. We
probe for those characteristics the early
research suggested were important, such
as locus of control or need for achievement. Many of these are interesting and
valid measures but not necessarily
precise for identifying entrepreneurs.
Then there are some of the “others.” Two
questions we recently found in an online
quiz included the responses (and these
would be the ones desirable for entrepreneurs): “I like to be ‘wild’ and uninhibited and go fast. I like to act on
impulse.” Though these may be extreme
examples, the tone is not an unusual part
of the discussion. One noted professor
describes his explicit goal as making his
students’ “spines sweat.” On a recent trip
to Malaysia, one of the authors of this
essay saw a grade sheet posted on a
bulletin board with the results of an
entrepreneurial assessment. How would
the teenage recipient of a 60 on his or
her assessment think about entrepreneurship in the future. Are we really

58

ready to screen people out of entrepreneurship though they are still coming
into their own?
The entrepreneur world is heavily
influenced by a lecture teaching methodology, basically a stand-and-deliver
approach. However, we combine this
with the use of many guest speakers,
selected with a precise list of criteria
reflecting again in this world’s particular
definition
of
“entrepreneur”
and
“success.” This means that most of our
guest speakers tend to be white males
who have started and usually grown
their businesses. To be fair, over the
years, the examples of role models have
become somewhat more diverse along
some dimensions, but it is a continuing
push.
The pedagogical implications of the
entrepreneur world are a description of
the entrepreneur, neatly fitting into an
“observe, describe, and measure”
approach, supporting categorizations
and some correlations but not able to go
beyond (Christensen and Carlile 2009).
In some sense, our students taught in
this world see entrepreneurship as a box
in which they either fit or do not. Their
concern is that they do not have the right
stuff/characteristics to be an entrepreneur. As teachers, our choices of entrepreneurial illustrations set up role
models and our students often do not see
a reflection of themselves. The ironic
part is that with all this description,
picking the winners does not get any
easier.

The Process World
Low and MacMillan (1988) called for
more causal, process-oriented research.
Amit, Glosten, and Muller (1993)
reviewed core entrepreneurship research
challenges and concluded that given the
interdisciplinary nature of entrepreneurship, analytical and empirical tools
should be borrowed from other disciplines to develop theory around the
process of entrepreneurship. The call

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

<-----Page 4----->was echoed in Venkataraman’s (1997)
seminal paper on the distinctive domain
of entrepreneurship. The influence of
strategy scholars working in the field
coupled with calls for more rigorous and
methodically sound studies led scholars
to operationalize entrepreneurship as a
process with greater emphasis on the
organizational level of analysis. The
process view extends the reach of entrepreneurship from firm creation to firm
exit; thus, there is increased attention
given to capital markets, resource allocation, performance, and growth. The
process research results found their way
into the classroom, and textbooks today
take a more process-oriented approach.
The process is presented and taught in a
linear fashion as one of identifying an
opportunity, developing the concept,
understanding resource requirements,
acquiring resources, implementation,
and exit (Morris 1998).
We refer to the process world as one
of planning and prediction. The analytical approach of teaching opportunity
evaluation, feasibility analysis, business
planning, and financial forecasting is
the cornerstone for most entrepreneurship curricula today. Perhaps the
process world is so popular to teach in
because we can. When most agreed that
entrepreneurs did not have specific
traits, we were motivated to find processes to teach. Business plan writing
and the case method in this world are
the preferred pedagogies. In a field
where we argue that there are no right
answers, the process world, from an
education perspective, is the closest we
can get.
Though the business planning process
is an attractive and powerful learning
process, a disproportionate amount of
time is spent honing secondary research
skills than actually taking smart action in
the real world. Any educator that has
used the business plan as a major course
project (authors included) understands
the inner thoughts of students:

Student 1: The longer the plan the
better. A long plan indicates more
work and a better grade.
Student 2: It’s the midpoint of the
semester and I’m convinced my
opportunity is not viable but I
have to complete the plan because
it represents 30% of my grade. I
don’t have time to start over.
Student 3: Once I’m finished with
this plan on my new bar I’m going
to mail it to every venture capitalist in the area.
The argument for business plan
writing can succinctly be summed up in
one sentence: the business plan is
required for investment. Gumpert
(2002), in his entertaining book, Burn
Your Business Plan, questioned why we
even write business plans. He points to a
growing industry of consultants, software designers, and educators that
“market” business plan writing and have
created the perception that it is a
required document for every entrepreneur. Though the true premise of his
book is about developing relationships
with a spectrum of investors, his point is
duly noted. Even venture capitalists do
not want the business plan novels; they
want action and proof of concept first. As
educators, we must ask ourselves if we
are forcing students to write a business
plan too soon.
To complement the planning portion
of core entrepreneurship courses, the
case method is used so students can
learn about the various decision options
faced by entrepreneurs. The case study is
admittedly a powerful tool that allows
the center of learning to be with the
students; however, the majority of
faculty are never adequately trained in
the case method. Teaching using the case
method takes an extraordinary amount
of time—both in prep as well as in
mastery. Christensen (1991) stated that
the case discussion teacher has to master
questioning, listening, and response;

NECK AND GREENE

59

<-----Page 5----->these skills are inextricably linked, fail to
effectively work in isolation, and require
teaching flexibility and, we would argue,
skills of an improvisation artist. The
downside of teaching a case without
adequate training is that student learning
is compromised. A classroom discussion,
as engaging as it may be, is not the same
as a case study discussion and does not
necessarily lead to the accomplishment
of learning objectives.
The process world in our view is one
of prediction. It focuses on a linear
process that if followed correctly, will
increase the likelihood of venture
success. The steps in the process are
generally introduced in introductory
entrepreneurship courses, then electives
are offered to delve deeper into particular steps. For example, classes on opportunity,
entrepreneurial
marketing,
entrepreneurial finance, and managing
growth are commonplace and mainstream in the most developed entrepreneurship programs. The problem is that
entrepreneurship is neither linear nor
predictable, but it is easy to teach as if it
were.

The Cognition World
Again, let us state that our approach
here is not evolutionary or linear, but
there is an undeniable time element in
that the cognitive approach emerged
more recently than our other two worlds.
In fact, the cognitive approach has even
been described as emerging as a
response to the “failure of past ‘entrepreneurial personality’ based research to
clearly distinguish the unique contributions to the entrepreneurial process of
entrepreneurs as people” (Mitchell et al.
2002, p. 93). This description is interesting in that it recognizes not only the
earlier research focus on the person but
also the role of the entrepreneurial
process.
The cognitive approach in entrepreneurship is really only about 15 years old
and with a few exceptions, has only

60

started to make its way into the classroom
in the last five years. In this world, we are
again focusing on the entrepreneur or the
entrepreneurial team but in a quite different way. This newer focus on the person
is in a more dynamic way that recognizes
the potential for learning how to think
entrepreneurially. If we start from Neisser’s 1967 definition of cognition as the
processes that allow sensory inputs to be
transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored,
retrieved, and used, we can then advance,
at least for our purposes, to the entrepreneurial cognition approach. Now we look
at the “knowledge structures that people
use to make assessments, judgments, or
decisions involving opportunity evaluation, venture creation, and growth”
(Mitchell et al. 2002, p. 97). As educators,
we can work with knowledge structures.
The early questions in cognitive entrepreneurship focused on topics such as how
do entrepreneurs think and is that a
potential competitive advantage? (Mitchell et al. 2002). This approach brings
us back to the question of who is the
entrepreneur or when is someone an
entrepreneur?
The more helpful question is “how do
people think entrepreneurially?” This is a
much more useful construct to guide our
educational and research activities in the
field, recognizing the great diversity in
the ways people can be entrepreneurs.
We were recently asked quite seriously
about the role of “gut” in teaching entrepreneurship, and it is a very fair question. The mental models underlying the
cognitive approach (Krueger 2007)
provide us with the ways and means to
address such questions, leading toward
the potential of providing both skills and
increased confidence to our students. In
this way, our focus expands to include
both doing and thinking.
So, what and how do we teach in this
world? We pay attention to different
things, including the decision to become
an entrepreneur and how to understand
that decision. We investigate the entre-

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

<-----Page 6----->preneur and most certainly now include
the team. We spend more time on discovery, specifically on the identification
and exploitation of opportunities, and
we explore what we believe to be the
central question of this world: how do
people think entrepreneurially.
Part of our emphasis to guide pedagogy is therefore on the think . . . do. In
order to do this, we use cases and simulations, but we use them in a different
way. When we focus on the entrepreneur
as the protagonist, we are exploring not
only the venture process but the
decision-making process. Others are
using the writing of narratives and
scripts using the Mitchell et al. (2000)
approach of arrangement, willingness,
and ability to further the students’ understanding of how they process information about entrepreneurship. We also
have seen a number of great approaches,
exercises, and classes on the search for
opportunities, including Jim Fiet’s systematic search (Fiet and Patel 2006;
Nixon et al. 2006) and DeTienne and
Chandler’s 2004 opportunity identification exercise. Overall, in this world, we
are focusing on entrepreneurial decisions and we do it by discussing the role
of expert scripts, heuristics, and schema,
leading to the construction of entrepreneurial mental models.
In summary, the entrepreneur world
has clearly informed us that there is no
one type of entrepreneur. This means
one of the challenges of the cognitive
world is to avoid the trap of the entrepreneur world and therefore be able to
recognize the richness of a diversity of
cognitive approaches, again linked to a
diversity of entrepreneurial motivations
and desired outcomes or definitions of
success. At the same time, with an overreliance on teaching entrepreneurship as
a process, the process world appears
linear and predictable. Innovation is
often absent because we teach and
applaud the use of existing business
models often arguing that using proven

models reduces the risk of failure. The
vast majority of our student’s plans are
not based on a truly innovative product
or service. Even more absent is the innovation in business models. This leaves us
in the position of largely replicating
existing forms of businesses and therefore, even existing kinds of economies.
The cognition world is growing in popularity because it recognizes the importance of the mind and the dynamic
approach to learning how to think
entrepreneurially.

New Frontiers:
Entrepreneurship as a
Method
Why do we support entrepreneurship
as a method? Because a process implies
that you will get to a specific destination.
Entrepreneurship is often thought of as a
process—a process of identifying an
opportunity, understanding resource
requirements, acquiring resources, planning, and implementing. However, the
word “process” assumes known inputs
and known outputs as in a manufacturing process. For example, building a car
on an assembly line is a manufacturing
process. You know all the parts; you
know how they fit together; and you
know the type of car you will have at the
end. A process is quite predictable.
Entrepreneurship is not predictable. On
the other hand, a method represents a
body of skills or techniques; therefore,
teaching entrepreneurship as a method
simply implies that we are helping students understand, develop, and practice
the skills and techniques need for productive entrepreneurship.
Figure 1 contrasts teaching entrepreneurship as a process and a method.
Teaching entrepreneurship as a method
requires going beyond understanding,
knowing, and talking; it requires using,
applying, and acting. Entrepreneurship
requires practice. Learning a method
may be more important than learning

content. In an ever-changing world, we
need to teach methods that stand the
test of dramatic changes in content and
context. Rather than viewing practical or
pedagogical knowledge as derivative of
scientific knowledge, it is more appropriate to view practice and teaching as
distinct modes of knowing in their own
respects (Van de Ven and Johnson
2006). Knowledge of teaching and practice take their place alongside of science
as distinct and complementary elements
of professional knowledge (Kondrat
1992 in Van de Ven and Johnson 2006).
When each of these different kinds of
knowledge are together focused on the
world’s complex problems, they have
the potential to produce a deeper
understanding than any one type of
knowledge applied alone (Van de Ven
and Johnson 2006). Perhaps, this is ultimately the nature of entrepreneurship
education.
Approaching entrepreneurship as a
method means teaching a way of
thinking and acting built on a set of
assumptions using a portfolio of techniques to encourage creating. The
method forces students to go beyond
understanding, knowing, and talking. It
requires using, applying, and acting. The
method requires practice. Therefore, our

62

underlying assumptions of the method
include the following:
(1) Applies to novice and experts: the
assumption is that the method
applies across student populations
and works regardless of experience
level. What is important is that each
student understands how he or she
views the entrepreneurial world
and his or her place in it. It represents the foundation of the method.
(2) The method is inclusive, meaning
that the definition of entrepreneurship is expanded to include any
organization at multiple levels of
analysis. Therefore, success is idiosyncratic and multidimensional.
(3) The method requires continuous
practice. The focus here is on
doing, then learning, rather than
learn then do. As a result a reflective practice component is incredibly important to learning.
(4) The method is for an unpredictable
environment.
The Method approach firmly recognizes that entrepreneurship is teachable.
Similar to the approach to leadership discussed in Quinn and Anding, “We can be
in a normal, reactive state or an extraor-

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

<-----Page 8----->dinary, creative state. Anyone can move
from where they are now to a more
reactive or more creative state” (1999, p.
489). The question is how to do this. For
us, it means experimenting with a pedagogical portfolio that emphasizes the
dimensions of the method. We suggest a
portfolio here that includes starting businesses as part of coursework, serious
games and simulations, design-based
learning, and reflective practice.

Starting Businesses
Starting businesses as part of coursework has become more mainstream
over the past few years. Babson College,
for example, started its Foundations of
Management
and
Entrepreneurship
(FME) course in 1996 where first year,
undergraduate students are required to
start a business during their first year at
the college. The focus of FME is on
opportunity recognition, resource parsimony, team development, holistic thinking, and value creation through harvest.
The vehicle of learning is a limited duration business start-up steeped in entrepreneurial thinking and a basic
understanding of all functions of business. Because FME is a required course,
all first-year undergraduates experience
the entire cycle of entrepreneurship.
The course is a blend of theory and
practice, which forms the basis for the
entire Babson undergraduate core curriculum. The overall purpose of the
course is to allow students to practice
business and entrepreneurship so the
content comes alive. The objectives of
the course include:
(1) Students practice entrepreneurship
and generate economic and social
value.
(2) Students understand the nature of
business as an integrated enterprise
and knowledge of all key business
areas is essential in developing a
well-rounded business aptitude in
preparation for the real world.

(3) Students use information technology (IT) for decision-making and
productivity and learn that IT is
essential in supporting all areas of a
business.
(4) Students experience social responsibility and philanthropy through
the donation of their time (six hours
minimum) and business profits to
charitable organizations.
Many business schools today have
incorporated the real-world practice of
business creation into their entrepreneurship curriculum. For example, the
2010 United States Association for Small
Business and Entrepreneurship winner
for model entrepreneurship course was
awarded to Monmouth University for its
capstone experience where students
work in teams to start businesses.
However, as we talk about a pedagogy of
practice within the entrepreneurship
method, we are advocating for realworld venture creation courses to take
place at the beginning and not at the end
of entrepreneurship programs. We
suggest this because at the undergraduate level, students have little business
experience and to truly develop empathy
for the entrepreneur, one must experience new venture creation before he or
she can study business management or
other disciplinary areas. Furthermore, a
level of confidence is generated from the
“doing” experience and students begin to
experience success and failure as well as
practice
methods
for
navigating
unknown territories. Students experience the ups and downs of entrepreneurship and learn about the sweat equity
associated with a start-up. They gain
knowledge of the importance of leadership yet struggle with finding and developing their own style. They practice
entrepreneurship and through experience, learn about the power of human
agency, yet effectively managing and utilizing human resources is more art than
science. Students feel defeat after making

NECK AND GREENE

63

<-----Page 9----->poor decisions and experience elation
over small wins. In hindsight, they
underestimate the role of trust between
managers and employees and learn delegation is not a choice. In the end, they
finally learn that the best opportunity in
the world is of little value without a
strong team that can execute. Such
strength is derived from open and constant communication, shared but challenging goals, and the ability to adapt in
uncertain environments.

Serious Games and Simulations
To play or not to play? That is indeed
the question. The influence of computer
games and gaming on the rising generations is under investigation with consideration of the applications in both the
academic and professional worlds. There
is a large variety of definitions of serious
games, with most sharing two common
grounding assumptions (Greene, Forthcoming). First, there is an element of
“game” usually defined as having rules
and a sense of “gameplay.” Second, there
is the expectation of fun. Gaming aligns
learning, play, and participations while
exposing students to real challenges in a
virtual world. Today’s games require
50–100 hours to master, which equals
the amount of time a student spends on
a semester-long course (Pink 2006).
There is indeed a rising use of games
in spaces where simulations were prevalent but with that added expectation of
the gameplay and fun elements. We both
attended a Serious Game Summit as part
of the annual Game Developers Conference and heard the presentations on how
Hilton Garden Inn is using games to train
its staff on customer service. We learned
how Intel uses games for network training, and for one of the most far-reaching
examples, how the U.S. Army and the
Canadian Army each use computer
games and alternative reality games for
recruiting and training purposes.
Babson, similar to a few other
schools, has been investigating and

64

experimenting with the use of serious
games in our entrepreneurship curriculum for some time. To date, our focus
has been on three main areas. First, we
developed and tested a social media
alternative reality game for teaching
social media to faculty members. The
intent was to help faculty understand
what is available, how it can be helpful
to entrepreneurs, and how it can be
useful in teaching entrepreneurship. The
framework of the game was an elaborate
treasure hunt that required the faculty/
students to not only visit social media
sites but to use each one of them in a
way that would benefit an entrepreneur
(or entrepreneurship student). The ultimate treasure was a hidden chest containing what was labeled “Roger
Babson’s Secret Entrepreneurship Curriculum” and was in reality a list of
resource materials for teaching serious
games.
Another one of our game experiments
was the use of an off-the-shelf computer
game. The Sims, and the expansion
packet, Open for Business. The purpose
of the game was to compact the business
creation process in order to map the creation of organizational culture, particularly through the way the student/
entrepreneur/player used his or her time
and his or her money in relation to the
business, the employees, and the community. The course is based on a combination of institutional- and resourcebased theories to provide guidance for
students in creating culture as a resource.
The greatest challenge was to get students to stop playing the game.
Finally, we developed a video game to
support learning about how entrepreneurs think under conditions of risk,
uncertainty, and unknowability. The
game is based on the theory of effectuation (Sarasvathy 2008) and is designed to
replace a case study for an in-class discussion on entrepreneurial thinking.
Overall, the use of serious games is part
of the method approach; it allows stu-

approach for serious results.

Design-Based Learning
The basic argument is that entrepreneurs think, and perhaps act, similar to
designers. In our quest to define, understand, and even measure the entrepreneurial mindset, the world of design is a
good starting point for our inquiry.
Entrepreneurship is an applied discipline, yet we are teaching and researching as if it was part of the natural
sciences (Simon 1996). Furthermore, the
impact of entrepreneurship research is
limited and little has been performed to
assess the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education. Herb Simon argued that
applied disciplines are better served by
design-based curricula. Design is a
process of divergence and convergence
requiring skills in observation, synthesis,
searching and generating alternatives,
critical thinking, feedback, visual representation, creativity, problem-solving,
and value creation. Teaching entrepreneurship through a design lens can help
students identify and act on unique
venture opportunities using a toolkit of
observation, fieldwork, and understanding value creation across multiple stakeholder groups.
At the core of entrepreneurship is the
identification and exploitation of opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman 2000),
yet the majority of entrepreneurship
courses assume that the opportunity has
been identified. In the process world, we
talked about case studies and business
plan writing. The majority of entrepreneurship case studies focus on opportunity evaluation, but little attention is
given to how the opportunity was identified beyond a surface-level discussion
related to the life history of the entrepreneur. In a traditional business plan
course, very little time is given to practicing tools of creativity and idea generation. Overall, very little is done to train a

student to think more entrepreneurially
and creatively participate in opportunity
discovery. We argue that such a discovery process should be grounded in fundamental design principles so students
are equipped with tools to not only find
opportunities but to also make opportunities (Sarasvathy 2008).

Reflective Practice
The idea of encouraging reflection is
certainly not new, and if anything, is
regaining its currency as a critical component of the overall learning experience. From Socrates, through Thoreau to
the present day, the emphasis on taking
time to think often resonates and yet
seems difficult to inject into an actionbased curriculum in an overarching and
meaningful manner. For many of our students, simply sitting still and thinking
does not come naturally or easily, and
yet, the power of the potential
outcome—“being aware of our actions so
we can evaluate them” (Brockbank and
McGill 2007, p. 85) seems clear.
Reflection is an important process by
which knowledge is developed from
experience. When reflecting, one considers an experience that has happened and
tries to understand or explain it, which
often leads to insight and deep
learning—or ideas to test on new experiences. Reflection is particularly important for perplexing experiences, working
under conditions of high uncertainty,
and problem-solving. As a result, it
should not be a surprise that reflection is
an integral component of entrepreneurship education and also a way of practicing entrepreneurship.
Donald Schön (1983, 1987) coined the
term reflective practice while studying
applied university programs such as
medicine, law, and architectural design.
He argued that the knowledge acquired
through coursework, what he called
propositional knowledge, was limited in
its impact because it did not take into
consideration the reality of practice. Yet,

<-----Page 11----->he discovered that professionals graduating from applied programs were still
effective despite how they were taught.
Schön
learned
that
professionals
enhanced their practice through engagement and developed “practice experience” (Brockbank and McGill 2007).
Schön distinguished “reflection-onpractice” (do–learn–think as a process)
from “reflection-in-practice” (do–learn–
think as a behavior). Both are important
and represent a continuous cycle of
learning.
Schön found the teachers and students engaged in reflection on
emergent practice that was to
underpin their learning and therefore enhance their practice.
Putting it more simply, students
learned by listening, watching,
doing and by being coached in
their doing. Not only did they
apply what they had heard and
learned from lectures, books, and
demonstrations but when they did
an action that was part of their
future profession, for example
using a scalpel, they also learned
by reflecting themselves and with
their [teachers], how the action
went. They reflected on their practice. In addition, they would “take
with them” that reflection on their
previous actions as a piece of
“knowledge” or learning when
they went into the action the next
time. Thus in the next action they
would be bringing all their previously acquired understanding and
practice and be able to reflect in
the action as they did it, particularly if a new circumstance came
up. (Brockbank and McGill 2007,
p. 87)
Given the nature of entrepreneurship
as a continuous cycle of action, learning,
testing, and experimenting, developing
students as reflective entrepreneurs

66

requires
reflection-on-practice
and
reflection-in-practice as part of a pedagogy portfolio.
A primary objective of reflection is
deep learning. Marton (1975) categorized
learning as surface or deep. Surface
learning is associated with a more
passive approach that is premised on a
model of education that is dependent on
learning, absorbing, and regurgitating.
Deep learning is associated with a more
active approach characterized by a desire
to grasp and synthesize information for
valuable and long-term meaning.

Conclusions
There is agreement, at least in theory
but not in practice, that entrepreneurship
courses should be taught differently from
the traditional management courses
(Vesper and McMullen 1988). Kent
(1990) even stated that “entrepreneurship education must be entrepreneurial”
(p. 284), whereas early writings by
Plaschka and Welsch (1990) pointed to
emerging structures in entrepreneurship
education:
As the criticisms of business
education show, current analyticalfunctional quantitative, toolsoriented, theoretical, left-side of
the brain, overspecialized, compartmentalized, approaches are
not adequate to begin solving illdefined, unstructured, ambiguous,
complex multidisciplinary, holistic, real world problems. (p. 61)
Table 1 summarizes the known
worlds (entrepreneur, process, cognition) that we teach in today as well as the
new
frontier
presented
here—
entrepreneurship as a method.
Our purpose was to acknowledge that
we teach in several different worlds.
Many teach in more than one world, but
the environment for entrepreneurship is
changing whereas education for entrepreneurship is not. We are living in a

Method World

<-----Page 13----->world characterized by increasingly
greater levels of uncertainty and even
unknowability. We are advocating for an
entrepreneurship method approach for
three reasons: First, entrepreneurship
education is incredibly important, but
current, mainstream approaches are
dated. Second, real-world experience
contributes significantly to learning, but
sometimes, the cost of failing in the real
world is too high. Finally, and because of
points 1 and 2, entrepreneurship within
a formal education structure requires
a new approach based on action and
practice.
As you can see from our example pedagogy portfolio, the method is teachable,
learnable, but it is not predictable. Starting businesses help students “feel” what it
is like to assume the role of an entrepreneur. Serious games and simulations
allow students to play in virtual worlds
that mirror reality. Designed-based learning encourages student to observe the
world through a different lens and create
opportunities. Finally, reflective practice
gives permission to our students to take
time, think, and absorb the learning of
their
practice-based
curriculum.
Together, our portfolio of feeling,
playing, observing, creating, and thinking
is the entrepreneurship method and a
prescription for practice.
The method is people-dependent but
not dependent on a type of person. The
entrepreneurship method goes beyond
understanding, knowing, and talking
and demands using, applying, and
acting. Most importantly, the method
requires
practice.
Entrepreneurship
requires practice. Learning a method, in
our opinion, is often more important
than learning specific content. In an
ever-changing world, we need to teach
methods that stand the test of dramatic
changes in content and context. At
the end of the day, perhaps we do not
teach entrepreneurship the discipline.
Perhaps we teach a method to navigate
the discipline.
