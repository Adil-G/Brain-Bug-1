Venture Capital
Research: Past^ Present
and Future
Vance H. Fried
Robert D. Hisrich
The period since 1980 has seen the emergence of venture capital as an area of academic
Interest and research activity. This interest is merited given the importance of venture capital to economic development and new venture creation. This paper surveys venture capital
research since 1981. Based upon that research, a descriptive model of the venture capital
process is proposed. The model is then used to develop suggestions for future research
topics. Suggestions for improving research methodology are also included.

rven though venture capital is a major source of financing to entrepreneurial
firms, particularly those needing second and third stage financing, there was limited
academic interest and research in the field until 1980. Given the importance of venture
capital financing to economic development as well as venture creation, it is not surprising that venture capital has emerged as a topic of more interest and research effort.
This research effort is the focus of this paper, which not only surveys writings on
venture capital since 1981, but also uses this survey as the basis for suggestions for
future research in the field.
Our review was limited to "academic'' literature. There are several good "practitioner" books (e.g. The Larry and Barry Guide to Venture Funding, Venture's Guide to
Financing and Investing in Private Companies, and Venture's Guide to International
Venture Capital) in print, as well as trade periodicals like Venture, Inc., Venture Capital
Journal and Entrepreneur. These works provide a good introduction to the field. They
may also be a source of data to the researcher. However, we have not included them in
our review because their orientation and methodology are generally quite different from
that of the academic literature.
The year 1981 was chosen as the starting date for this review since the literature to
that time has already been surveyed (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1981; also see Timmons, Fast &
Bygrave, 1983). The list of articles to be surveyed was gathered by first looking at the
past issues of the American Journal of Small Business, Journal of Business Venturing,
Journal of Small Business Management, Proceedings of the Babson Research Conference, and Proceedings of the Academy of Management (Entrepreneurship Division)
since all have a stated interest in venture capital. Then citations from these articles were
also reviewed.
The end result was a total of 16 articles, 18 proceedings papers and 5 book chapters.
This represents a significant increase in activity from the six studies reviewed by
Tyebjee & Bruno. The Bahson Conference Proceedings and Journal of Business Venturing were the main outlets for work in this field. However, articles also appeared in

Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.
Table 1 includes a listing of all of tbe studies, along with a brief summary of each
article. A brief overview of tbe researcb follows.

Research Topics
The researcb between 1981 and 1987 focuses on six primary topics:
• PortfoUo of venture capital firms. Studies have looked at tbe size and composition of individual firm portfolios (Hutt & Thomas, 1985), tbe size and composition of
tbe aggregate industry portfolio (e.g. Brophy, 1981), and factors influencing tbe aggregate portfolio such as interest rates and stock market conditions (e.g. Bygrave &
Timmons, 1985).
• Investment Decision. Studies have focused on what factors influence whether or
not a project is funded (e.g. Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984) and tbe effect of investment criteria on performance (e.g. MacMillan, Siegel & SubbaNarasimha, 1985). Tbe studies
focus on tbe initial investment decision rather than tbe decision on funding follow-up
investment.
• Operations. The focus has been on what venture capitalists do with tbeir time
(e.g. Gorman & Sahlman, 1986). Also of interest has been the networking relationships
between venture capitalists (Bygrave, 1987).
• Strategy. The nature of the industry has been examined using Porter's framework
(Bruno, 1986). Strategic groups have been identified based upon investment criteria
(MacMillan, et al., 1985), industry expertise (Bygrave, 1987), level of venture capitalist
activity in tbe management of the investee (Gorman & Sahlman, 1986), and stage of
investment preferred, staffing, funding source and size of investment (Robinson, 1987).
• Impact on the Entrepreneur. Some of the research looks at the process from the
viewpoint of the entrepreneur. Questions examined include: Wben is venture capital
needed (if at all) in the life of a business? How long does it take to get? What happens to
firms rejected by venture capitalists (Bruno & Tyebjee, 1985)? What are tbe life stages
of a venture. How do tbe stages relate to tbe risk of a venture (Ruhnka & Young, 1987)?
• Public Policy. The main issue studied bas been tbe impact of changes in tbe
capital gains tax rate on the flow of funds into tbe industry (e.g. Bygrave & Timmons,
1985). Otber tax and securities law questions bave also been examined (e.g. Schell,
1982).
Most studies deal with more tban one of tbese six topics. The heaviest researcb
emphasis bas been placed on the portfolio and investment decision topics. Tbese are tbe
only areas where the research has advanced past a very simple descriptive phase.

Research Framework
Most of the studies do not explicitly refer to any theoretical framework. However,
financial economics theory is implicit in much of tbe work on tbe investment decision.
Some attempts bave been made to formally tie venture capital to financial economics
theory, witb many difficulties noted (e.g. Bropby, 1982, 1986; Tyebjee & Bruno,
1984). Tbe only otber theory used is resource exchange theory as an explanation for
networking among venture capital firms (Bygrave, 1987).
Wbile an overall model of tbe venture capital process has not been developed,
significant progress towards tbis end bas been made. Chan (1983) has analyzed the roles
and functions of tbe investor, venture capitalist and entrepreneur. Tyebjee & Bruno

(1984) have developed a model of a single investment by a venture capitalist. Stevenson, Muzyka & Timmons (1986, 1987) have identified a variety of factors which
have a significant impact on the overall performance of a venture capital firm's portfolio.

Methodology
Except for the studies of the flow of funds into the industry and the work of Hoban
(1981) and Brophy (1982), the research has used a cross-sectional design. The primary
source of data is survey using mail questionnaires. Telephone interviews have also been
untilized. Generally the questionnaires have been closed-ended and called for subjective
responses.
Fall, 1988

<-----Page 7----->Limited use has been made of secondary sources. The major exception is the work
of Bygrave & Timmons using the Venture Economics database, which includes information on over 4000 projects funded by venture capitalists. Two studies, Hoban (1981)
and MacMillan & SubbaNarasimha (1986), have made use of private documents generally kept by venture capitalists in the ordinary course of business.
Units of analysis have been the venture capital industry as a whole, the individual
venture capital firm, the individual venture capital investment, and the individual venture capital investee (or potential investee). The work of Bygrave & Timmons grouped
investments based on a high tech/low tech distinction and segmented venture capital
firms based on their high tech/low tech investment emphasis. Otherwise research designs have generally ignored differences between venture capital firms and also between
investees.
Usually the venture capitalist has been the source of information. In some cases
(Bruno & Tyebjee, 1985) the investee has been the source. None of the studies attempted to gather and compare data from both the venture capitalist and the investee
about the same transaction. None of the studies gathered data from the actual investor.
The statistical methods utilized varied. Many of the studies simply reported frequency counts, percentages or means. However there have been several studies using
regression (e.g. Hoban, 1981; Khan, 1987), as well as factor analysis, clustering and
discriminant analysis (e.g. MacMillan, et al. 1985; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984). MonteCarlo simulation (Stevenson, et. al., 1986, 1987) and general stochastic dominance
(Martin & Petty, 1983) have also been used.

DIRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
While still in its infancy, venture capital research has advanced to the point where a
simple, descriptive model of the venture capital process can be tentatively developed.
We have developed such a model (see Figure 1), primarily to serve as an organizing
framework for research in the field.
The process can be broken up into three levels. At the extremes are the investor and
the investee, an entrepreneurial firm. The investor has both funds to invest and a desire
to invest in entrepreneurial firms. The investee has developed to an extent that it is in
need of outside capital and has chosen venture capital as its source. In the middle lies
the venture capitalist who serves as intermediary between the investor and the entrepreneurial firm. Venture capital research is primarily concerned with three areas: 1. the
relationship between investor and venture capital firm, 2. the relationship between the
venture capital firm and the investee and 3. the operation of the venture capital firm.
No significant research has been conducted on how venture capital firms are created. Apparently the process involves, in a somewhat simultaneous manner, the structuring of the relationship between the investor and venture capital firm, staffing of the
firm, selection of firm strategy and marketing to investors.
After the firm is funded, the firm then spends most of its life making and managing
investments. This includes the individual investment process (discussed shortly in more
detail) as well the firms ongoing relations with its investors and its relations with other
venture capital firms (e.g. networking). Firm staffing and strategy formulation are also
likely to periodically reappear as areas of activity.
Finally the firm enters a liquidation phase where funds are paid out to investors.
Since the firm will generally have several investments with differing lives, there will be
significant overlap between the management and liquidation phases. However, most
firms are created so that at some point, they will be totally liquidated.

Investment Process
Tyebjee & Bruno (1984) have developed a model of the venture capital process as it
pertains to an individual investment. It describes the creation, management and liquidation of a single venture capital investment. With some modification we have incorporated it into our overall model.
The investment process starts out with a search for deals by the venture capitalist. In
many cases the venture capitalist is rather passive at this stage, preferring to let the
entrepreneur find him. In other cases the venture capitalist may actively seek out investment proposals, sometimes going so far as to create a venture to carry out an idea of the
venture capitalist.
Next comes a screening process in which the venture capitalist examines the various
proposals. Since, on the average, less than two per cent of the proposals are funded, it
appears that the venture capitalist screens out most proposals without giving them an
in-depth evaluation. Commonly cited screening criteria are size of investment, technology and market sector of the venture, geographic location, and stage of financing.
The proposals which pass through the screen are then evaluated in a much more
detailed manner. Most of the research we have labeled investment decision concerns the
criteria for evaluation. The actual process through which the evaluation is made has not
been seriously studied. [For example, venture capitalist view management staying
power as an important criterion (MacMillan, Siegel, & SubbaNarasimha, 1985), but
how do they determine if the management has staying power?]
Assuming a proposal passes the evaluation, the next step is structuring the transaction. This involves placing a value on the entrepreneurial firm for purposes of in vestFall, 1988

23

<-----Page 9----->ment. It also includes the selection of type(s) of the securities (e.g. common stock,
debentures with warrants, etc.) the venture capital firm will be purchasing and their
basic terms. Unlike traditional investment instruments, provisions for management
compensation and the control rights of the venture capitalist are of major concern.
Assuming the proposal is funded, the investment enters a management stage. Here
the venture capitalist becomes involved in monitoring the performance of the investment. Since the investments are generally in dynamic business situations, an active
monitoring effort is necessary.
The venture capitalist also assists the firm in a variety of ways. They include recruiting additional management personnel, securing additional financing, establishing
relationships with new customers and suppliers, and advising on strategic planning.
Also, in some cases the venture capitalist may forcibly intervene in the management of
the investee.
Ultimately the investment is liquidated. This is done in one of four ways: 1. the
investee going public, 2. the investee being acquired by another company, 3. management of the investee buying out the venture capital firm, or 4. the investee going
bankrupt.
It is extremely important to realize that the investment process is often recursive.
The venture capitalist, after making an initial investment, is often faced with a decision
as to whether a follow-up investment(s) should be made, if so then how structured, etc.

AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
A comparison of existing venture capital research against our model makes two
things clear. First, research is at an early stage on some parts of the model, such as the
evaluation stage. Second, many parts ofthe model are virgin territory for the researcher.
Therefore it seems appropriate that research in the next few years should have a broad
focus. A multitude of questions need to be addressed.
We have several suggestions for further research which we have tied to our model.
Our list does not purport to be all-inclusive. Brophy (1986), Kierulff (1986), Timmons
(1981), and Tyebjee & Bruno (1984) have also proposed several areas for future research, some of which we have incorporated with our own.
Investor. What are the motives for investing in venture capital? What are the expectations? What has been the actual outcome?

Venture Capital Firm Level
Create firm. How are funds structured? How does the structure impact strategy and
performance? How much power does the investor have in the process? How is the firm
staffed? What impact does staffing have on its marketing, strategy and relationship to
investees? How is the staff compensated? What is the relationship between staffing,
compensation and performance? How is marketing done? What is the impact of the
firm's funding source on strategy? What is the relationship between marketing and firm
strategy?
Making and matiaging investments. What is the role of the different firms in networking? What is the impact of networking on strategy and performance? What is the relationship of the firm to its investors at this stage? In addition to the three activities suggested by our model, what other activities does the venture capitalists perform? How are
venture capital firms managed?
Fund liquidation. How are funds liquidated? When are funds liquidated? What is the
24

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 10----->impact of the method and timing of liquidation on firm performance? on firm relationships with investees?

Investment Process
Search. What is impact of the method of deal origination on whether or not a project
gets funded? on investment performance?
Screening. Are screening criteria fairly standard throughout the industry? If so, are
potentially significant venture not being seriously evaluated by anyone in the venture
capital industry because they do not meet industry screening criteria? Do some proposals
which pass through the screen still get rejected without an in-depth evaluation? If so,
why?
Evaluation. How does the evaluation process work? How does the decision on
whether or not to make a follow-up investment differ from the initial investment decision? How do venture capitalists measure potential risk and return? How can existing
evaluation criteria be improved.? What is the relationship between the various investments in the firm's portfolio?
Structure. How is a value placed on an investee? How important is the valuation to
performance of the investment? What impact do the terms and types of securities have
on retums? on the relative power of the investee and venture capitalist? What is the
impact of the various powers granted the venture capitalist on the power relationship
between venture capitalist and investee? How does this affect performance? What is the
investee's financial stake in the venture? How is management compensated? How does
management's financial interest and compensation affect commitment to the venture? to
venture performance?
Management stage. How are investments monitored? How does the venture capitalist provide assistance to the investee? Why does the venture capitalist perform these
activities rather than the management ofthe investee? Is the assistance always wanted by
the investee's management? How important is this assistance to venture performance?
When should a venture capitalist intervene in the management of an investee? How
should intervention take place? What is the power relationship between venture capitalist
and management? What impact does this have on performance? Does the role of the
venture capitalist change significantly over time?
Liquidation. How rapidly are ventures liquidated? What impact does timing have on
investment performance? Is there a relationship between performance and method of
liquidation? What determines method of liquidation? What is the role of investee's management in determining the method and timing of liquidation?
Investee. When is venture capital advisable? What is the trade-off between the need
for more capital and dilution? How much does venture capital cost? How available is it?
Does the venture capitalist really add value? Are there viable altematives to venture
capital?

Methodology
Given the embryonic nature of venture capital research, an extensive criticism of
studies based on their methodology does not appear appropriate. Thus we have not
made a formal review of issues such construct validity, construct measurement and
performance measurement as has been done in more mature disciplines (for an example
of this approach applied to strategy literature see Venkatraman & Grant, 1986, and
Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). However, some general comments on methodology can be made.

<-----Page 11----->• Objective variables can be used as well as subjective (e.g. Hoban, 1981; MacMillan, etal., 1987).
• More sophisticated measurement instruments can be developed or adapted from
other disciplines.
There needs to be more longitudinal research.
Available secondary sources should be utilized more fully.
More time needs to be spent by researchers observing the process.
There is a strong need for in-depth case studies in this field (Brophy, 1986).
The perspectives of investors and investees should not be ignored.
Investors and investees are another source of data.
Medium-grained techniques combining both qualitative and quantitative techniques can be used (Harrigan, 1983).
• Where appropriate, research design should consider the heterogeneity of venture
capital firms (Timmons, Fast, & Bygrave, 1983).
• Research design should address the likelihood of industry effect when looking at
the performance of investees (MacMillan, et. al. 1987).

Theory Development
Attempts to apply financial theory to venture capital research have run into
problems, primarily because of the lack of capital markets for the investee's securities
(Brophy, 1986; Kierulff, 1986; Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984; Wetzel, 1982). However there
may be more fundamental problems. First the level of uncertainty involved is extremely
high. This makes its quantification difficult and raises a question as to whether expected
value is the proper decision criteria (Lopes, 1981, 1983). Second, there is evidence that
venture capitalists are not totally rational decision-makers (Sahlman & Stevenson,
1985). Finally, the contributions of the venture capitalist to the entrepreneurial firm are
more than financial.
Thus, while there may be room for some adaptation of financial theory to venture
capital as Brophy argues, financial theory should not be the only theoretical basis for
research. Venture capital plays an active role in the strategy, marketing, management
and legal structure of the entrepreneurial firm. It is likely that concepts from all of these
disciplines are relevant to the study of venture capital. Venture capital research is a
wide-open field with room for a variety of research approaches.
