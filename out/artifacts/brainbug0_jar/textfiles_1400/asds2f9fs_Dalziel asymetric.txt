Asymmetric interfirm relations are bilateral or multilateral relations between a large
central firm and one or more small niche firms. I present a typology of asymmetric
interfirm relations and consider how such relations will evolve over time as the central
firm moves towards the frontiers of increasing value for customers and new knowledge.
The theoretically grounded understanding of the nature and evolution of asymmetric
interfirm relations enables the integration of heretofore disparate literatures that focus on
specific types of interfirm relations, often in specific industries, and thereby enables
further development of theory and more generalizable empirical work.

<-----Page 1----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

For the present purposes, asymmetric interfirm relations are defined as bilateral or
multilateral relations between a large central firm and one or more small niche firmsi.
Bilateral asymmetrical relations are prevalent in high growth industries such as the
biotechnology industry where new small firms compete and collaborate with established
large pharmaceutical firms (Rothermael, 2001). Multilateral asymmetrical relations are
prevalent in industries that make complex products such as the automotive industry
where large firm systems integrators rely on a network of suppliers for subsystems and
parts (Dyer, 2000), in industries that sell products and services to consumers or to
numerous sparsely distributed organizations (Lane & Maxfield, 1996), and in industries
where large firms provide platform products that small firms integrate into higher level
systems products (e.g. Intel processors, Gawer & Cusumano, 2002), or complement with
content offerings such as software applications (e.g. Sun’s Java, Garud, Jain &
Kumaraswamy, 2002).

Several researchers have observed that large and small firms have complementary
strengths related to the superior ability of small firms to bring new products to market,
and the complementary superior ability of large firms to provide global marketing and
distribution services in the timeframe required to capture value from the innovation
(Arrow, 1983; Freeman & Soete, 1997; Lindholm, 1997; Rothwell, 1983; Teece, 1986;
Williamson, 1975). Asymmetric interfirm relations are studied in several distinct
literatures including corporate venturing (Chesbrough, 2002; Gompers & Lerner, 1999),
the literature on governance structure choice that looks at the choice between non-equity
alliances, equity alliances, and acquisitions as alternative governance modes for large-

2

<-----Page 2----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

small firm relations ( Folta, 1998; Pisano, 1989), the mergers and acquisitions literature
insofar as it considers large firm acquisitions of small, technology-based firms (Graebner
& Eisenhardt, 2004), and the literature on business ecosystems (Iansiti & Levien, 2003;
Moore, 1996).

Despite the proliferation of studies on the nature and evolution of asymmetric
interfirm relations in specific industries and the large bodies of research on particular
facets of large-small firm relations, we have thus far been unable to draw general
conclusions because we don’t have a theoretical framework in which to ground our
emerging understanding. A suitable theory needs to explain how different types of
asymmetric interfirm relations relate to one another and must be sufficiently general so to
accommodate, for example, the very different worlds of automobile supplier networks
and bilateral large-small firm relations in the biotechnology industry. It must also be a
dynamic theory that can explain how and why large-small firm relations evolve, and for
example, why some small firms are likely to get acquired while others are not.

In this paper I present a theory of the nature and evolution of asymmetric
interfirm relations. I begin with a static systemic approach that classifies asymmetric
interfirm relations on the basis of type, and then develop a dynamic functional theory of
how relations can be expected to evolve (McKelvey, 1982). While the typology draws
upon multiple dimensions to explain the incidence and nature of large-small firm
relations, the two dimensions of proximity to customer and knowledge novelty are
particularly important to understanding the relative positions of central and niche firms.

3

<-----Page 3----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

On the basis of proximity to customer, customer-facing relations are distinguished from
competitor and supplier relations, while entrepreneurial relations are distinguished from
classical relations on the basis of knowledge novelty. This yields six types of asymmetric
interfirm relations namely, classical and entrepreneurial customer-facing relations,
classical and entrepreneurial competitor relations, and classical and entrepreneurial
supplier relations.

Based on the assumption that over time innovative central firms will continuously
explore the frontiers of greater value for customers and new knowledge I develop
propositions regarding the impact that the central firm’s forward momentum will have on
the evolution of the relationships in which it engages, and thereby on its niche firm
partner. Entrepreneurial firms that lead the central firm through exploratory activities
face a range of alternative futures that include strong growth, acquisition, a continued
leadership role based on superior exploration capabilities, and exit from the leadership
role. Firms that neither lead nor follow the central firm must maintain their ability to
complement its activities by keeping pace in innovativeness and by maintaining a suitable
distance from the central firm on the proximity to customer dimension. Finally classical
firms that follow the central firm enjoy strong growth opportunities if they are able to
pool economically the activities relinquished by the central firm.

The next two sections describe the nature of asymmetric interfirm relations and
their attributes. The following section describes the likely evolution of relations and
develops propositions regarding likely outcomes for niche firm partners. A discussion

4

<-----Page 4----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

section considers how the typology and the propositions can be used to integrate the
extensive but disparate literatures that contribute to an understanding of asymmetric
interfirm relations in the interests of creating a more theoretically-grounded body of
knowledge and opportunities for more generalizable empirical work.

THE NATURE OF ASYMMETRIC INTERFIRM RELATIONS

The Relative Positions of Central and Niche Firms

The two dimensions of proximity to customer and knowledge novelty are used to
describe the relative positions of central and niche firms. Niche firms that are closer to
the customer than the central firm include firms such as resellers that serve as channels to
market for the central firm, electronics firms that embed central firm components in
systems products that are higher on the systems hierarchy (Baldwin & Clark, 2000)ii, and
content providers that offer products that are complementary to the platform products
offered by central firms. In all cases the complementary advantage of the customerfacing firm is that it is closer to the customer than the central firm, either geographically
for resellers that represent central firms in specific regions, in terms of being higher on
the systems hierarchy, or in terms of more deeply understanding the needs and
behaviours of customers in the market segment. Niche firms that are suppliers are further
from the customer than the central firm, while niche firms that are competitors operate at
the same level as the central firm on the proximity to customer dimension.

5

<-----Page 5----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

The second dimension is knowledge novelty. Where knowledge novelty is high,
exploration activities dominate, while where knowledge novelty is low, exploitation
activities dominate (March, 1991). Central firms generally occupy an intermediate
position on the knowledge novelty dimension, reflecting their need to invest in highly
uncertain exploration activities to prepare for the future, while simultaneously attending
to the exploitation of their current resources and capabilities to maximize value capture
(Dougherty, 2001; O’Reilly & Tushman, 2004). Niche firms that occupy higher
positions on the knowledge novelty dimension than the central firm are leveraging the
superior ability of small firms to address ambiguous or highly uncertain opportunities
(Arrow, 1983; Bhidé, 2000; Rothwell, 1983; Williamson, 1975), while niche firms that
occupy lower positions are less innovative small firms that do not engage in activities that
explore the frontiers of knowledge. I refer to central firm relations with niche firms that
are higher on the knowledge novelty dimension as entrepreneurial and central firm
relations with niche firms that are lower on the knowledge novelty dimension as
classical.iii

While I have referred to knowledge novelty as a single dimension it is actually a
multi-dimensional concept with facets that range from scientific uncertainty, to the
inability of customers to articulate unknown needs (Leonard-Barton, 1995), capital
market volatility, and environmental complexity (Lane & Maxfield, 1996). Other authors
refer to the same dimension as uncertainty (Arrow, 1983; Williamson, 1975), Knightian
uncertainty (Knight, 1921), or irreducible uncertainty (Bhidé, 2000). I have chosen to
avoid the uncertainty terminology first because of the strong connection between

6

<-----Page 6----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

uncertainty and negative outcomes in many people’s minds, and second because the
knowledge novelty terminology focuses attention on the fact that firms create value by
resolving uncertainty and thereby creating unique knowledge.

Combining the three relative positions that niche firms occupy on the proximity to
customer dimension with the two relative positions they occupy on the knowledge
novelty dimension yields six modes of asymmetric interfirm relations as shown in Figure
1, below. It is common to consider the horizontal and vertical dimensions in
examinations of interfirm relations (Richardson, 1972) and the horizontal dimension is
conspicuously absent from Figure 1. The horizontal dimension is not useful in the
development of a theory of interfirm relations because it lacks a direction and therefore
no criterion for ordering firms. Firms that are horizontal competitors can offer the same
or similar products, or they can serve the same or similar customers, or they can use the
same or similar technologies. Where firms are different on the horizontal dimension their
classification relative to one another is nominal not ordinal. In the following paragraphs I
describe each of the six asymmetric interfirm relations modes in general terms.

--------------------------------------Insert Figure 1 about here.
---------------------------------------

Customer-Facing Relations

7

<-----Page 7----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

Classical customer-facing firms operate at the low end of the knowledge novelty
dimension. They do not generally explore new technologies or new markets and as a
result do not generate the unique knowledge that can be associated with high profits.
Much of the uncertainty associated with new product design has been resolved by the
central firm that produces a product that is close to a complete system and engages a
network of resellers to allow it to achieve geographic or product market reach cost
effectively. As the central firm is resolving the main uncertainties itself, it sees little
value in according its niche firm partners the latitudes they would require for
experimentation, and so classical customer-facing firms typically operate under fairly
tight constraints related to the nature of the products and services they offer, the terms
under which they offer them, and their geographic scope.

Entrepreneurial customer-facing firms operate more highly on the knowledge
novelty dimension and often engage in the development of new technology and new
markets. In entrepreneurial customer-facing relations, central firm partners produce a
platform that is of limited value on its own and rely on their niche firm partners to embed
the product in a higher level system (Gawer & Cusumano, 2002) or add content to it to
generate demand from an emerging market segment (Garud et al., 2002). Because the
complementary products created by entrepreneurial customer-facing firms will differ
from one another, and because relations with central firms are usually governed through
the market, entrepreneurial customer-facing firms face few constraints imposed by their
central firm partners.

<-----Page 8----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

Supplier Relations

Supplier relations are prevalent in mature industries such as the automotive and
aerospace industries that make and sell technologically complex products (Quinn, 2000).
Under such arrangements, system integrators address the major market and systemrelated uncertainties and component suppliers provide components according to the
specifications supported by the system integrator (Baldwin & Clark, 2000). The
designation of interface standards requires a certain level of stability in the overall system
(Clark, 1985) and for this reason supplier relations are usually established after the
emergence of a dominant design (Utterback, 1996). Supplier relationships are most
effective when they are stable, allowing each partner to develop distinctive competencies,
and geographically proximate, allowing the exchange of tacit knowledge and physical
parts (Dyer, 2000). Central firms manage multilateral supplier networks using recurring
contracts.

In industries with a high level of technological change, new firms are created that
offer sophisticated, next generation components and technology. In the computer and
communications industries new semiconductor design firms are producing advanced
integrated circuits that they sell to systems integrators in entrepreneurial supplier
relations. Similarly in the automotive industry new firms that specialize in alternative
energy fuel cells are partnering with automobile manufacturers in entrepreneurial supplier
relations. Because the development of sophisticated new technology is capital intensive

9

<-----Page 9----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

and offers the possibility of a strong competitive advantage to the central firm,
entrepreneurial supplier relations are often supported by central firm investment in the
niche firm partner.

Competitive Relations

Typically central firms will not develop relations with niche firms that are
competitors but there are special circumstances where it will be advantageous for them to
do so. Central firms tend to be generalists that cannot serve all market niches
economically (Carroll, 1985). Leading central firms will prefer that uneconomical
market niches are served by many small firm competitors rather than by one or a few
competitors that may come to represent a competitive threat. Barnett and Carroll (1993)
recount how early in the 20th century Bell supported very small competitors, either
directly or indirectly through regulatory changes, because such actions made business
more difficult for Bell’s larger and more threatening competitors. Niche firm competitors
of the type supported by Bell typically operate in a position that is lower on the
knowledge novelty dimension than the central firm, and are classical competitors.

Another reason for cooperating with firms that are competitors is to benefit from
the complementarities attributable to the competitor firm operating more closely to the
frontiers of knowledge novelty. Entrepreneurial small firms that are in front of the
central firm on the knowledge novelty dimension offer the central firm learning
opportunities and innovative new products and services through a superior ability to

10

<-----Page 10----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

address ambiguous opportunities (Bhidé, 2000). In return, the central firm offers the
niche firm some form of complementary asset (Teece, 1986) that facilitates new product
development or helps the niche firm achieve success in the marketplace and appropriate
the benefits of innovation. Entrepreneurial partnerships are associated with periods of
technological change and industry growth and are bilateral partnerships, often involving
central firm ownership of niche firm equity. It may be that entrepreneurial firms can
offer value to central firms even if they have a competitive relationship with the central
firm and do not share information. By pushing the envelope on value creation in the
ecosystem they enhance the health of the ecosystem for all participants (Iansiti & Levien,
2003). When this happens, central firms are well positioned to capture much of the new
value.

The decision to view interorganizational relations in two dimensions instead of
one usefully departs from the literature. Other authors have focused on the vertical
dimension, distinguishing marketing relations from development relations (Hagedoorn,
1993; Pisano, 1989). Such a distinction may present no severe difficulties when firms
undertake only two kinds of relations; in the pharmaceutical industry it allows marketing
arrangements to be distinguished from relations with biotechnology firms and in the
automotive industry it allows dealer relations to be distinguished from supplier relations.
But the one dimensional view breaks down when firms employ two kinds of
developmental relations, one with suppliers that provide parts and components and one
with entrepreneurial competitors that are exploring the future. The two dimensional view
presented here enables such a distinction.

THE ATTRIBUTES OF ASYMMETRIC INTERFIRM RELATIONS

This section describes the attributes of asymmetric interfirm relationship modes.
As shown in Figure 2, below, exogenous factors, central firm partnership strategy, and
niche firm attributes are antecedents of relationship mode, relationship design is a
characteristic of relationship mode, and interfirm knowledge flows and relationship
evolution are consequences of relationship mode. This section deals with the
antecedents, characteristics, and knowledge flows of asymmetric interfirm relations, and
the next section explores how relations are expected to evolve.

--------------------------------------Insert Figure 2 about here.
---------------------------------------

Exogenous Factors

Three exogenous factors are expected to impact the incidence of asymmetric
interfirm relations: the emergence of a dominant design, the rate of industry growth (or
decline), and the degree of geographic proximity between partner firms.

Emergence of dominant design. In the fluid period prior to the emergence of a
dominant design there is a high rate of entry of new firms and this increases the

12

<-----Page 12----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

population of small firm competitors and potential partners for incumbent firms
(Utterback, 1996). In general entrepreneurial relations are expected to increase prior to
the emergence of a dominant design while classical relations are expected to follow it.

Entrepreneurial customer-facing relations may be an effective way to promote the
widespread adoption of the central firm’s product and therefore may be expected to be
particularly prevalent prior to the emergence of a dominant design. Central firms will
work to promote the success of their niche firm partners by committing to standards and
by offering free development toolkits (Garud et al., 2002; Gawer & Cusumano, 2002).
The logic of entrepreneurial customer-facing relations may become less powerful once a
dominant design is established and firms that were once entrepreneurial customer-facing
firms may revert to a classical customer-facing role in such circumstances. For instance,
Lane and Maxfield (1996) describe how the Carterphone decision of 1968 spawned the
creation of many independent communications equipment distributors that served as
entrepreneurial customer-facing firms for new entrant equipment vendors that were
pursuing the opportunity created by the technological shift to digital switching. Once
digital switching became a commonplace technology with generally agreed upon
performance parameters (i.e. once the dominant design was established) the independent
communications equipment distributors ceased to operate as pioneers exploring the
frontiers of the new technology and customer expectations and reverted to the classical
reseller role.

13

<-----Page 13----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

The establishment of supplier relationships requires sufficient knowledge of the
system to be able to identify modules and interface specifications (Baldwin & Clark,
2000; Brusoni, Prencipe, & Pavitt, 2001). This knowledge is likely to follow the
emergence of a dominant design (Clark, 1985) and so the incidence of supplier relations,
particularly classical supplier relations, is expected to increase following the emergence
of a dominant design.

Rate of industry growth. Entrepreneurial relations are associated with periods
of industry growth because strong growth attracts the entry of new entrepreneurial firms
and because entrepreneurial relations serve to fulfill a growth agenda for the central firm.
When central firms are downsizing they lack the resources to invest in relations with
entrepreneurial firms and may avoid doing so for fear of reputational penalties associated
with investing in new firms or acquiring firms while laying off employees. The rate of
both corporate ventures (Gompers & Lerner, 1999) and acquisitions (Graebner &
Eisenhardt, 2004) increase during periods of growth and decrease during periods of
contraction. Supplier relations are created both during periods of industry growth,
facilitating a fast increase in productive abilities, and during periods of industry decline,
facilitating cost reductions. Customer-facing relations are not expected to be strongly
influenced by the rate of industry growth.

Geographic proximity. Geographic proximity facilitates exchanges between
firms but geographic reach facilitates the widespread adoption of new products and
services. When possible, supplier relationships are expected to be geographically

14

<-----Page 14----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

proximate to facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge and physical parts between
partner firms (Dyer, 2000). In contrast, customer-facing relations are expected to vary in
their degree of geographic proximity in order to facilitate geographic reach. The effect of
geographic proximity on entrepreneurial relations is less strong than its effect on classical
relations. While central firms prefer to establish entrepreneurial relations with firms in
the geographic vicinity they will not let geographic distance deter them from establishing
a partnership with exceptional entrepreneurial firm (Bunnell, 2000).

Central Firm Partnership Strategy

The nature of the central firm’s partnership strategy is a key determinant of the
relationship’s existence, design, and evolution. Porter (1980) identified three classes of
generic strategies, differentiation, overall cost leadership, and focus, and argued that
firms would be more likely to create a sustainable competitive advantage if they adhered
to one of the three strategies. While the relationship between adherence to a specific
generic strategy and sustained competitive advantage is disputed (Chrisman, Hofer, &
Boulton, 1988), the three generic strategies effectively identify different ways of creating
value.

A central firm that engages in partnerships with niche firms has the opportunity to
draw upon a number of relationships simultaneously to enact its corporate strategy. It
can increase its ability to create highly differentiated new products and services through
relationships with entrepreneurial firms, it can reduce the costs of operations and

15

<-----Page 15----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

innovation by outsourcing activities to a network of suppliers, and it can simultaneously
focus on a number of niche markets through a network of firms with capabilities that are
valued by specific market segments. Thus while it may be inadvisable for a single,
independent firm to risk getting “stuck in the middle” by trying to simultaneously employ
more than one generic strategy (Porter, 1980:41), through its ecosystem, a firm can
simultaneously benefit from all three generic strategic approaches.

Each relationship mode is associated with a particular configuration of central
firm strategic motivations. Classical supplier relations are expected to be motivated
primarily by cost considerations while classical customer-facing relations are expected to
be motivated by cost considerations and the desire to address multiple niche markets
simultaneously. In general, entrepreneurial relations are associated with differentiation
strategies. Entrepreneurial competitor and supplier relations will be motivated almost
entirely by differentiation objectives while entrepreneurial customer-facing relationships
will be motivated both by differentiation objectives and by the desire to serve multiple
niche markets simultaneously.

Niche Firm Attributes

Niche firm role. Niche firms tend to focus on a limited range of value chain
activities and use partnerships to draw upon the competencies of other firms to complete
the value chain (Iansiti & Levien, 2003). Technology-based niche firms access the
complementary technological, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution capabilities of

16

<-----Page 16----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

established firms in order to bring their products to market and appropriate the benefits of
innovation (Teece, 1986). Modular product architectures facilitate this process by
enabling standardized interfaces between a system and its components allowing system
integrators to outsource component design and production to niche firm component
suppliers (Baldwin & Clark, 2000; Schilling, 2000). Reversing the arrangement, niche
firms sometimes specialize in marketing, sales and distribution activities and perform
these functions on behalf of central firms. In contrast, niche firm competitors take a
generalist approach and choose not to specialize in a specific value chain function instead
performing a broad range of functions including research, product design, marketing,
sales, and distribution. I identify three value chain approaches of niche firms: the
technology (or manufacturing) specialist that is typically a supplier, the market specialist
that is typically a classical customer-facing firm, and the generalist that is typically a
competitor or an entrepreneurial customer-facing firm.

Niche firm growth objective. Bhidé distinguishes between high and low growth
niche firms on the basis of the degree to which they pursue ambiguous opportunities
(Bhidé, 2000)iv. Entrepreneurial niche firms pursue ambiguous opportunities that are
characterized by high degrees of knowledge novelty while classical niche firms pursue
low uncertainty opportunities where customer expectations are well understood and
environmental turbulence is low. Ambiguous or highly uncertain opportunities are
associated with high growth because they make high returns a possibility (Kulatilaka &
Perotti, 1998). Partnerships with entrepreneurial niche firms allow large central firms to

17

<-----Page 17----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

benefit from the small firm’s superior ability to pursue ambiguous opportunities and this
complementarity is the hallmark of relationships in the entrepreneurial mode.

Relationship Design

Two elements of relationship design are considered, whether the relationship is
multilateral or bilateral, and the governance structure of the relationship.

Number of participating firms. Strong central firms will inspire large numbers
of niche firms to participate in their ecosystem whereas less powerful central firms will
generally have smaller networks. Supplier and customer-facing relations are generally
multilateral and will involve a network of niche firms. The exception is entrepreneurial
supplier relations that are likely to be bilateral because they focus on the specific
capabilities of the niche firm that have arisen as a result of its successful pursuit of highly
uncertain opportunities. Similarly, entrepreneurial competitor relations, where they exist,
are also expected to be bilateral.

Governance structure. I consider four governance mechanisms for interfirm
relationships. Listed in order of increasingly hierarchical characteristics they are:
unmediated market-based relationships, market-based relationships that are mediated by
recurring contracts, quasi-hierarchical franchise relationships, and quasi-hierarchical
equity-based relationships

18

<-----Page 18----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

The least hierarchical relationships are entrepreneurial customer-facing relations
that involve a central firm that provides a platform and a loosely connected network of
niche firms that create complementary products and services for the platform. The
central firm may not even be aware of the existence of a particular customer-facing
partner, but it is aware of the class of firms of which the particular firm is an instance,
and it may work to promote the creation and viability of the class of firms as a whole.
Nokia has two classes of entrepreneurial customer-facing partners that participate in
Forum Nokia. There are well over one million community members for whom
membership is free and to whom Nokia makes available toolkits for the development of
content applications for mobile phones. There are only about 400 firms that are members
of the professional program and these firms are screened and pay for the privilege of
membership, but in exchange enjoy a wider range of benefits and a closer relationship
with Nokia (Nokia, 2004).

Supplier relationships between systems integrators and component suppliers are
typically managed through a series of contracts (Dyer, 2000). Contracts are market
mechanisms but where there is the expectation of recurring contracts, the economic
relationship becomes embedded in a social context (Granovetter, 1985). Quasihierarchical relationships include franchises and equity alliances. Both approaches offer
the central firm some degree of control over its niche firm partner. Franchise
relationships require a low level of uncertainty that allows the terms of the relationship to
be fully specified in the franchise contract and they are most strongly associated with
classical customer-facing relations. In contrast, equity alliances can be constructed in

19

<-----Page 19----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

such a manner as to allow the niche firm partner near full autonomy and thus are suitable
under relatively uncertain conditions such as those associated with entrepreneurial
competitor and entrepreneurial supplier relations.

Interfirm Knowledge Flows

In the following I consider the quality and direction of interfirm knowledge flows
based on four principles: tacit knowledge will be exchanged more readily in bilateral
relations than in multilateral relations, knowledge will be exchanged more readily
between complementors than between competitors, firms that are positioned higher on
the knowledge novelty dimension will have knowledge that is sought by firms that are
positioned lower, and firms that are positioned closer to the customer will have
knowledge that is sought by firms that are positioned lower.

Quality of knowledge. The sharing of tacit knowledge is essential to the creation
of new products, services, and processes (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). The sharing of
tacit knowledge is facilitated by common understandings, close relationships, and trust
and therefore is more likely to take place in bilateral partnerships than in large
multilateral networks. Sophisticated central firms recognize the challenge associated
with sharing tacit knowledge among multiple network participants, for instance Toyota
has developed a multi-faceted approach that combines multilateral and bilateral processes
for knowledge transfer and learning in its supplier network (Dyer, 2000). More
commonly, the knowledge shared between firms in classical supplier and customer-

20

<-----Page 20----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

facing networks is likely to be largely explicit. Central firms will furnish classical
partners with explicit product specifications and information necessary to do their job. In
return, classical partners will supply central firms with the required data but this will
follow a standardized format to facilitate centralized data analysis.

Central firms may make concerted efforts to learn from entrepreneurial customerfacing and supplier partners because such firms are either more innovative, closer to the
customer, or both, but they are challenged in this regard by the difficulty of transferring
knowledge across firm boundaries (Kogut & Zander, 1992). Nokia has in place several
initiatives designed to help it engage with and learn from its network of entrepreneurial
customer-facing complementors (Nokia, 2004), but it is unlikely that Nokia is able to
learn vicariously from the experiments that are taking place within its network. In the
biotechnology industry, central firms employ contract research organizations that are
entrepreneurial suppliers to conduct clinical trials of new drugs. Consistent with the
finding that it is easier to transfer knowledge within than across firm boundaries, Azoulay
(2003) found that central firms outsource the production of data but pursue knowledge
production internally.

Primary direction of knowledge transfer. Central firm system integrators are
required to “know more than they make” to effectively establish interface requirements,
source components, and ensure that components conform to interface specifications
(Brusoni et al., 2001). This implies outward knowledge flows in supply relations but this
may not be the case in entrepreneurial supplier relations. If the systems integrator has

21

<-----Page 21----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

outsourced so many functions that it is no longer able to effectively integrate
components, the onus may be on the component supplier to manage all issues related to
integration to reduce the risk for the systems integrator. In such cases, the primary
knowledge flow may be towards the central firm or bilateral if the systems integrator
continues to be a source of knowledge regarding customers and markets.

Many central firms engage in entrepreneurial competitor relations with the
express desire to learn from their niche firm partner (Doz, 1996). Where the niche firm
pursues significantly higher levels of uncertainty than its central firm partner, and where
both firms support the central firm’s learning objective, the direction of knowledge flows
will be from the niche firm to the central firm. For example, Cisco makes equity
investments in entrepreneurial competitors for learning purposes. In the late 1990s it had
made several investments in optical equipment firms (Red Herring, 2000a), an area which
it ultimately entered itself through acquisitions (Red Herring, 2000b).

In sum, the foregoing suggests that central firms will be strongly motivated to
share knowledge with their classical customer-facing and supplier partners but that the
multilateral nature of these relationships will make the exchange of tacit knowledge an
ongoing challenge. In contrast, competitor firms are generally not motivated to share
knowledge and so it will be exceptional when highly innovative entrepreneurial
competitors share knowledge with central firms and when central firms share knowledge
with less innovative classical competitors, notwithstanding the fact that the bilateral
nature of entrepreneurial competitor relations makes the sharing of tacit knowledge more

22

<-----Page 22----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

likely. Central firms may be strongly motivated to learn from entrepreneurial customerfacing firms as these firms are either more innovative or closer to the customer, or both.
The challenge is that these relations are the least hierarchical of all asymmetric interfirm
relations and so it will not be easy for central firms to develop the capacity to absorb the
knowledge its niche firm partners are generating (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Finally,
there is little to impede knowledge sharing in bilateral entrepreneurial supplier relations
except for the general difficulties associated with the differences in firm size (Doz, 1988)
and for the fact that central firms may regard the technical knowledge generated by
entrepreneurial suppliers as outside their area of interest.

THE EVOLUTION OF ASYMMETRICAL INTERFIRM RELATIONS

An innovative central firm will continuously explore the frontiers of knowledge.
It will generate or absorb knowledge of new technologies and processing methods,
emerging markets, changes to the institutional environment such as changes to
regulations and industrial standards, and new ways of organizing its internal affairs and
external relationships (Dougherty, 2001; Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998; O’Reilly &
Tushman, 2004). As the frontiers of knowledge are continuously advancing, a firm in a
competitive environment must generate considerable forward momentum to merely stay
in place relative to competitors.

23

<-----Page 23----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

It also appears that many large firms work to become closer to their customers. In
the automotive industry vehicle manufacturers have outsourced many of their
manufacturing activities and have chosen to focus on activities such as design that
demand a deep understanding of customer preferences and customer service activities
such as financing. In the communications equipment industry systems firms are
undergoing a similar shift having divested their component divisions, outsourced their
manufacturing operations, and invested in strategic alliances with management consulting
firms to become more fully implicated in their customers’ business decisions, as opposed
to lower level technology sourcing decisionsv. In the pharmaceutical industry the shift
may be even more profound, if earlier in its development. Pharmaceutical firms are
shifting from offering generic drugs to drugs that are customized for the patient’s
physiology and the molecular makeup of the disease from which they are suffering
(Economist, 2004). Some researchers have suggested that these trends are general and
that we are moving towards an era of mass customization (Pine, 1993). Moving closer to
the customer may be understood to mean one or more of the following: more deeply
understanding and more thoroughly responding to customer preferences and behaviours,
offering a broader and more fully integrated range of products and services that more
fully satisfies the customer, or serving increasingly smaller market segments by using
technology and organizational approaches that facilitate mass customization. The central
firm’s centre of gravity may also move closer to the customer by virtue of its having
abandoned activities related to component development and manufacturing as in the
automotive and communications equipment industries. Regardless of the direction in
which the central firm ‘moves’ its motion will affect the niche firms in its ecosystem

24

<-----Page 24----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

according to their position relative to the central firm and its direction of motion. The
most likely path of motion, towards the frontiers of new knowledge and increased value
for customers, is depicted in Figure 3, below.

--------------------------------------Insert Figure 3 about here.
---------------------------------------

As shown in Figure 3, niche firms that are ‘in front’ of the central firm, in the
sense of being either closer to new knowledge or closer to the customer, engage in a
leading dynamic with the central firm. If the central firm moves as shown in Figure 3,
then both entrepreneurial competitors and entrepreneurial customer-facing firms are
likely to confront a leading dynamic. Firms that are ‘behind’ the central firm are likely to
encounter a following dynamic and as shown here this applies to classical competitors
and classical suppliers. Other firms maintain their complementary positions with respect
to the central firm and neither lead nor follow it, but move in tandem with it. This
requires that they follow a similar path of motion towards the frontiers of knowledge and
customer value. In the following I describe each of the three dynamics and develop
propositions regarding their impact on the evolution of the relationship between the
central and niche firms.

25

<-----Page 25----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

The Leading Dynamic

Niche firms that are engaged in a leading dynamic with the central firm face four
alternative futures: strong growth due to early mover advantages in growing markets,
acquisition by a competitor, a continued existence as a niche firm with superior
exploration capabilities, or exit from the leadership role. The most desirable outcome for
many entrepreneurial small firms is to be acquired (Graebner & Eisenhardt, 2004). Some
entrepreneurial competitors forego opportunities to sell and instead try to expand their
scale and scope so as to be able to compete with central firms, but this is a high risk, high
stakes undertaking and few firms succeed. Failure to achieve either acquisition or
dramatic growth makes survival difficult and requires that entrepreneurial competitors
either maintain their superior ability to explore and exploit new markets and new
technologies and thus stay in front of central firm competitors (this also keeps open the
possibility of acquisition or strong growth), or withdraw from the leadership position
either through closure or through an adjustment to their relationship with the central firm.
For example, a biotechnology firm that abandons efforts to develop its own marketing
and distribution capabilities and chooses instead to rely on revenues obtained from
licensing the new drugs it develops to other biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, is
no longer an entrepreneurial competitor to its central firm customers but has instead
become an entrepreneurial supplier (Doz, 1996).

Entrepreneurial customer-facing firms must maintain their ability to complement
the central firm by maintaining their superior knowledge of the customers in their niche

26

<-----Page 26----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

and by being at least as innovative as the central firm. They will be threatened by their
own high growth competitors and by the central firm if it decides to compete in the
complementary space. Unlike most manufacturers of personal electronics, Sony
competes in both the device and content markets by virtue of its ownership of film
studios Metro Goldwyn Meyer (MGM) and Columbia and so has a more ambiguous
relationship with content providers than do device manufacturers that do not compete in
the content space (Economist, 2005). Entrepreneurial customer-facing firms that fail to
sustain their comparative advantage will be unable to present the central firm with the
complementarities and learning opportunities it seeks and may suffer from declining
central firm interest as a result. If this happens they may revert to the classical customerfacing role or cease operations. Disruptive technologies that allow a larger and lessskilled group of people to avail themselves of a product or service at lower cost or more
conveniently may represent another threat to entrepreneurial customer-facing firms
(Christensen, 1997). For example, now that individuals can easily install computers and
software themselves, the need for organizations that specialize in such services is
reduced.

Proposition 1: Niche firms whose complementary or competitive advantage is
attributable to their being in front of the central firm face four alternative futures:
strong growth, acquisition, continued existence as a niche firm with superior
exploration capabilities, or exit from the leadership role. A stable existence as a
non-innovative firm is not an option.

27

<-----Page 27----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

The Complementary Dynamic

Niche firms that complement the activities of the central firm but that are neither
in front nor behind the central firm must maintain their complementary advantage by
keeping up with the central firm through continuous learning. In addition, they must
maintain a suitable distance between themselves and the central firm on the proximity to
customer dimension. For classical customer-facing firms this means maintaining
superior knowledge of the customers in their niche. Failure to do so results in a
weakened bargaining position due to the reduced ability to add value to the relationship
and may result in the central firm adopting an alternative means of reaching its
customers. For example travel agents, automotive dealers, and pharmacies have all had
their relationships with central firms compromised by the internet. If the central firm is
experiencing difficulties it may extract concessions from its classical customer-facing
firms in an effort to improve its own situation. For example, the relationships between
automobile manufacturers and dealers have become strained in recent years (National
Automobile Dealers Association, 2003).

As entrepreneurial suppliers are often established on the basis of component
expertise (e.g.. semiconductor chips or fuel cells) maintaining a suitable distance between
themselves and the central firm most often implies moving up the systems hierarchy to
embed their components in more easily integrated, higher level modules and subsystems.
For example, Hydrogenics a fuel cell supplier with entrepreneurial supplier relations with
several automotive manufacturers indicates that its strategy involves progressing from

28

<-----Page 28----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

supplying fuel cells, to stacks, and ultimately to more easily integrated modules
(Hydrogenics, 2005). This type of transition is especially important if the central firm is
moving away from the entrepreneurial supplier on the systems hierarchy in the interests
of closer relations with its customers.

Proposition 2: Niche firms that face an ongoing complementary dynamic with
respect to the central firm must maintain their complementary advantage through
continuous learning and through adjustments on the proximity to customer
dimension designed to maintain differentiation (for customer-facing firms) and ease
of product integration (for supplier firms).

The Following Dynamic

Aggressive classical suppliers enjoy strong growth opportunities as central firms
pursue new knowledge and closer relations with customers. By pooling activities that are
relinquished by the central firm, classical suppliers benefit from opportunities for strong
revenue growth, if not opportunities for equally strong growth in profits (Sturgeon,
2002). Electronic manufacturing service providers are examples of classical suppliers
that have grown quickly but that have to be extraordinarily efficient in order to be
profitable. In fact, many classical suppliers were formerly part of the central firm and
were spun off to increase the ability of the central firm to focus and achieve higher
profits. Examples include Delphi that was spun-off from General Motors in the
automotive industry, and Agere that was spun-off from Lucent in the communications

29

<-----Page 29----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

equipment industry. To maintain close relations with central firms, classical suppliers
may need to follow central firms up the systems hierarchy. For example, as automobile
manufacturers focus on design and customer service some of their suppliers have moved
up the systems hierarchy to engage in automobile assembly in addition to the provision of
parts and subsystems (Forbes, 2002). Similarly in the communications equipment space,
the electronic manufacturing service providers increasingly offer design services in
addition to manufacturing (Sturgeon & Lee, 2001).

Classical competitors will survive as long as central firms do not want or unable
to serve the niches they occupy. If new technologies or business models increase the
feasibility or desirability of serving small and possibly remote niches, then classical
competitors will come under threat. For example, Wal-Mart came to threaten classical
competitors in the theretofore seemingly undesirable niches the retail industry that had
been ignored by leading central firms such as Sears. It may be possible however for
classical competitors to sustain a competitive advantage if they can create a barrier to
entry by serving their niches more effectively than the central firm could. If this
capability is recognized by the central firm then collaboration may be possible. For
instance Amazon and sellers of rare or antique books collaborate on the basis of
complementary capabilities. Classical competitors are unlikely to be acquired for their
expertise but they may be acquired by a firm that wants to reach critical mass quickly.
Bower has coined the phrase ‘roll-up’ acquisitions to distinguish such acquisitions from
excess capacity acquisitions and those acquisitions done to integrate new technology or
products (Bower, 2001).

30

<-----Page 30----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

Proposition 3: Niche firms that follow central firms may enjoy strong growth
opportunities if they are able to pool efficiently the activities relinquished by the
central firm while remaining sufficiently innovative and proximate as to be useful.
Sufficient differentiation may allow classical competitors to survive.

Which Small Firms are Most Likely to Get Acquired?

The foregoing advances the consideration of which technology-based small firms
are most likely to be acquired. While Folta (1998) has argued that equity alliances are
options to acquire, other researchers have found that while small firms that engage in
equity alliances are indeed likely to be acquired, it is unlikely to be their equity alliance
partner that acquires them (Mitchell & Singh, 1992). Graebner and Eisenhardt (2004)
have examined the question of which small technology-based firms get acquired and
show that target firm strategic hurdles, the entrepreneur’s desire to sell, and synergies
between the selling and buying firms all make acquisition more likely.

The typology presented in this paper advances the study of which small firms get
acquired by positing that central firms move forward on the knowledge novelty and
proximity to customer dimensions and so are most likely to acquire firms that are in front
of them on these dimensions. The firms that are most clearly in front of central firms are
entrepreneurial competitors and I suggest that entrepreneurial competitors are the most
likely acquisition targets of central firms. Central firms are unlikely to acquire classical

31

<-----Page 31----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

customer-facing firms or suppliers because, in general, they are moving away from those
kinds of competencies. While it is possible that a central firm will acquire an
entrepreneurial customer-facing firm, it is unlikely because typically entrepreneurial
customer-facing firms are very small and have dissimilar capabilities (Richardson, 1972).
A central firm would only acquire an entrepreneurial customer-facing firm if it were to
diversify vertically into the space occupied by such firms. In contrast, acquiring an
entrepreneurial competitor may be a natural way of facilitating the central firm’s ability
to innovate. Entrepreneurial customer-facing firms and a fortiori entrepreneurial
suppliers are also acquisition candidates, but their most likely acquirers are leading
customer-facing firms and leading suppliers, respectively (i.e. their competitors).

Predicting which high-growth technology-based small firms are most likely to be
acquired is therefore a matter of determining which central firms have the strongest need
for new products and technology, coupled with the resources, such as an increasing share
price, that together will create both a need and a capability to acquire. One such central
firms are identified, predicting which small firms are most likely to be acquired is a
matter of predicting which of the small firm competitors of the central firm in question
has the most desirable technology. This was the logic used by industry analysts in the
late 1990s to predict which optical equipment firms were most likely to be acquired by
Cisco, a firm with a need for optical equipment expertise and the resources to facilitate
acquisitions (Red Herring, 2000b).

32

<-----Page 32----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

Proposition 4: The small firms that are most likely to get acquired are highly
innovative, successful small firms that have a competitive entrepreneurial relation
with a central firm that has the motivation and resources to acquire.

DISCUSSION

Asymmetric interfirm relations are prevalent and important. Central firms depend
on their ecosystems for the efficient exploitation of current opportunities and to explore
the frontiers new knowledge and greater value for customers. In turn, niche firms
depend on central firms for complementary elements of the value chain and are strongly
affected by central firm strategies and actions. This symbiotic relationship is
fundamental to the existence, nature, and evolution of many firms in our economy and
has been studied extensively. In the following paragraphs I show how the typology of
asymmetric interfirm relationship modes and the propositions on relationship evolution
allow us to relate these substantial bodies of knowledge to one another, resolve
inconsistencies, and identify areas in need of further research.

Towards an Integrated Literature

With respect to the incidence of asymmetric interfirm relations, researchers have
studied the rise of strategic alliances (Hagedoorn, 1993), the cyclical nature of corporate
venture capital relations (Gompers & Lerner, 1999), and the relative founding rates of
generalist and specialist competitors (Carroll & Swaminathan, 2000). In contrast we

33

<-----Page 33----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

know relatively little about the general incidence of supplier and customer-facing
relations, notwithstanding the extensive literature on the management of supplier
relations in specific industries (Dyer, 2000).

Where researchers have tried to establish the general incidence of interfirm
relations (Schilling & Steensma, 2001), an understanding of interfirm relationship modes
improves the interpretation of their results. In a key study, Shilling and Steensma
hypothesized a high incidence of interorganizational modularity in the electronics and
biotechnology industries based on the numerous reports that alliances are most prevalent
in such industries (Hagedoorn, 1993; Niosi, 1995). Instead they found
interorganizational modularity to be strongest in traditional industries such as publishing
and textiles. Their surprising finding is easily explained by the measure of
interorganizational modularity they used, contract manufacturing. Contract
manufacturing is an example of a classical supplier relation and as such is expected to be
prevalent in mature industries following the creation of a dominant design. An
alternative measure of interorganizational relations would likely have supported the
hypothesized relationship.

We know relatively little about the incidence of customer-facing relations and
their impact on participating firms. While entrepreneurial customer-facing relations are a
relatively new phenomenon, classical customer-facing relations are not and the lack of
scholarly interest in this area may reflect the overall apathy of management scholars
towards the creation of value for customers (Brief, 2003). Yet in many important

34

<-----Page 34----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

industries, leading firms have no direct relations with customers and rely on customer
facing intermediaries. Cisco is one of the most innovative large firms in the
communications equipment industry and it estimates that 90% of its revenues are
attributable to sales made by channel partners (Cisco, 2004a). The situation is similar in
the automotive industry where vehicle manufacturers rarely have a direct relationship
with their customers. Yet there are few studies that focus on customer-facing relations
and possibly no studies of the complete ecosystems of firms such as Cisco that engage in
all types of asymmetric interfirm relations. A better understanding of the incidence and
nature of customer-facing relations would complement the extensive knowledge base on
supplier and competitor relations.

A better understanding of the different modes of interfirm relations is useful in
interpreting existing knowledge. The literature on corporate venture capital distinguishes
between financial and strategic investments and between different types of strategic
investments (Chesbrough, 2002; Gompers & Lerner, 1999). Chesbrough distinguishes
between different types of strategic investments on the basis of tight and loose
operational links between the investing corporation and the venture, but tight operational
links between large and entrepreneurial small firms are rarely achieved (Florida &
Kenney; Doz, 1988). The theory on the evolution of asymmetric interfirm relations
provides an alterative means for distinguishing between different types of corporate
venture capital investments, one that is intuitive and allows the corporate venture capital
literature to be integrated with other literatures on interfirm relations. Based on the
investment motivation identified by Chesbrough, investments undertaken to explore

35

<-----Page 35----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

strategic whitespace, to experiment with new capabilities, and to develop alternative
technologies can be classified as leading corporate venture capital investments, while
those undertaken to support startups developing complementary products and services
and to promote favourable standards can be classified as complementaryvi.

An understanding of interfirm relationship modes is also useful in reconciling
conflicting empirical findings. For example, in the literature on governance structure
choice Pisano (1989) found that increased uncertainty results in the use of more
hierarchical governance structures while Folta (1998) found that increased uncertainty
results in the use of less hierarchical governance structures. In an examination of the
choice between non-equity and equity alliances in the biotechnology industry, Pisano
found that marketing alliances were governed using non-equity relations while multiproject, research and development alliances were governed using equity relations. Also
studying the biotechnology industry, Folta examined the choice between equity alliance
and acquisition and found that relations in high volatility subindustries were more likely
to be governed as equity alliances, while those in low volatility subindustries were more
likely to be governed as acquisitions.

Pisano (1989) compared customer-facing relations that are unlikely to be
governed using equity relations with entrepreneurial competitor relations that are likely to
be governed using equity relations. Folta (1998) compared a sample of entrepreneurial
competitor relations. Where uncertainty was very high, the central firm was likely to
refrain from acquisition and to engage in a equity alliance, while where uncertainty was

36

<-----Page 36----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

lower, the central firm was likely to proceed with acquisition. In this case the choice of
governance structure reflects the large firm’s unwillingness to internalize, through
acquisition, highly uncertain activities. So while Pisano’s sample included multiple types
of interfirm relations where variability in governance structure choice can be explained
according to relationship type, Folta’s sample was based on a single type of interfirm
relation with variability in governance structure dependent upon the distance between the
central and niche firms on the knowledge novelty dimension. So in both cases the choice
of sample had a determining effect on the relationship between uncertainty and
governance structure choice.

Researchers studying interorganizational relations have faced a trade-off between
detailed accounts of relations of a particular type in a particular industry and high level
accounts that address multiple industries. The theory presented in this paper allows us to
better understand how the detailed accounts fit together, where findings are contradictory
or confusing, and where further research needs to be done. This will allow us to
construct a comprehensive understanding of asymmetric interfirm relations that is general
and yet cognizant of the variability across industries, technology life cycles, and business
cycles.

Managerial Implications

The six modes of asymmetric interfirm relationships presented in this paper
identify different value creation logics for relationships between a central firm and niche

37

<-----Page 37----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

firms in an ecosystem. For strong central firms the questions raised by this paper include:
are we making effect use of all modes of interfirm relations that it makes sense for us to
use? Are we respectful of the inherent value creation logics of each relationship mode?
And, how can we expect our relationships to evolve? Less powerful central firms may
wish to identify a particular relationship mode that has a high potential to create value for
their firm, and may wish to work to sponsor the creation of niche firm partners that
operate in that mode. Even a modest central firm can do a great deal to support the
creation and growth of a niche firm partner by sharing information and by supporting the
niche firm partner’s efforts to attract investment capital.

Entrepreneurs creating new niche firms need to identify healthy ecosystems in
which to participate and strong central firms with which to partner. Their expectations of
the partnership need to be consistent with the partnership’s value creation logic as
defined by its mode.

Conclusion

The asymmetry in size between central and niche firms brings their
complementarities into relief and makes it possible to theorize on the nature and
evolution of their relations. Large central firms and small niche firms exhibit
complementarities on the proximity to customer and the knowledge novelty dimensions,
and movement of the central firm in these two dimensions creates challenges and
opportunities for the niche firms in their ecosystem. While several of the assertions

38

<-----Page 38----->Asymmetric Interfirm Relations

presented in this paper have already been empirically tested in specific industries, much
work remains in terms of performing cross-industry and longitudinal examinations of
both assertions and propositions. It may also be possible to extend this work
theoretically, both within the asymmetric interfirm context and beyond to consider how
the dimensions of proximity to customer and knowledge novelty might illuminate the
study of a variety of interorganizational relations that include government, university, and
non-profit players in addition to private sector firms.
ENDNOTES
i

Other others use the same expression to refer to related but different asymmetries such as asymmetries in
power.
ii
A system is hierarchical configuration of subsystems that are more or less independent from one another
(Simon, 1962). Based on systems theory, modularity researchers have identified roles for firms that are
related to the types of products they produce. At the top of the hierarchy are systems integrators that
produce systems, followed by subsystem suppliers that produce subsystems, and component suppliers that
produce components. Firms may also elect to produce complementary products that are not subordinate to
systems but which are added on to system platforms (Baldwin & Clark, 2000).
iii
The distinction between entrepreneurial and classical is not original. Graebner and Eisenhardt describe
the acquisition of “entrepreneurial” firms as a courtship and contrast it with the “classic” market for
corporate control (2004: 397). Similarly Lane and Maxfield describe strategy in complex environments as
partly exploratory and contrast it with the “classical” conception of strategy as control (1996: 226).
iv
Bhidé (2000) refers to entrepreneurial ventures as promising and to classical ventures as marginal.
v
Lucent spun-off its component division as Agere and Nortel sold its optical component division to
Bookham. All the leading North American firms have outsourced manufacturing, Nortel to Flextronics,
and Cisco to Solectron (Cisco never did perform all its manufacturing in–house). Furthermore, Cisco has a
number of strategic alliance partners that allow to implicate itself in the business decisions of its customers
and sell to CEOs on the basis of revenue growth rather than to information technology managers who must
operate within budget and are therefore more cost sensitive (Cisco, 2004b).
vi
Chesbrough (2002) also refers to corporate venture capital investments in spin-offs developing nonstrategic technology as strategic but I would consider this an alternative form of a financially motivated
investment.
