Abstract
This study draws upon the technology acceptance model as the theoretical basis and
empiricalfindingsfor a pragmaticexplanation
of key factors affecting personal computing
acceptance in small firms. The study uses
results from a survey of 358 users in small
firmsin New Zealand to test a structuralmodel
examining the hypothesized relationships
among the followingconstructs:intraorganizational factors, extraorganizationalfactors, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and
personal computing acceptance (i.e., system
usage). The findings indicate that perceived
ease of use is a dominantfactor in explaining
perceived usefulness and system usage, and
that perceived usefulness has a strong effect
on system usage. The results also indicate
that exogenous variables influence both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness,
particularlymanagement supportand external
support. Inconsistent with prior research in
large firms, relativelylittle support was found
for the influence of both internalsupport and
internal training. Implications for the acceptance of personal computing and future
research on personal computingacceptance in
small firmsare discussed.

Introduction
The increasing importanceand proliferationof
microcomputers and end-user computing
(EUC) represents a significantdevelopment in
the informationsystems (IS) field (Davis et al.
1989; DeLone 1988; Igbaria1993; Rivardand
Huff1988). This proliferationhas helped make
personal computing a significant activity in

small firms (Raymondand Bergeron 1992). In
1985, 25% of small firms were using computers; by 1990, 67.5% of small firmswere using
computers (BusinessWeek 1994).

Comparedwith largerfirms,small firmsusually
cannot affordto employ internalstaff withspecialized computer expertise (Nooteboom
1988). This means that small firms face substantial risks and problems with their computerization:they have a general lack of computer
knowledge, have inadequate hardware and
software, need to rely on outside resources,
experience a lack of financial resources and
technical support, have recruitmentdifficulties,
and have a short-rangemanagement perspective imposed by a volatile competitiveenvironment (Soh et al. 1992).
Thus, despite the proliferationof microcomputers, various problems withinsmall firms have
limitedthe potential benefits of microcomputers. The actual use of microcomputersby professionals and managers in small firms
appears to be limited to mainly accounting
applications(Cragg and King 1993). It is suggested that small firmscan increase the benefits from computing and can enhance the
usage of computers by increasingthe number
and type of applicationsavailableto them.
MuchIS implementationresearch has focused
on large organizationsand has identifiedseveral factors affecting IS success. However,
previous research suggests that there is a
relationship between organizational size and
computer success characteristics (DeLone
1988; Ein-Dor and Segev 1978; Raymond
1985, 1990a). This implies that the research
findings based on MIS environments in large
firms cannot necessarily be generalized to
small firms (DeLone 1981, 1988; Ein-Dorand
Segev 1978; Lai 1994; Raymond 1985,
1990b). Since small firms have distinctiveand
unique computing needs, as well as different
technology acceptance patterns compared
withlarge ones (Craggand King1993; Massey
1986; Rogers 1995), there is a need to investigate the applicabilityof these models to small
firms.

MISQuarterly/September1997

Recognizing that small firms represent a distinct group, this study extends existing IS
implementationas well as small firmresearch.
Relativelylittleis known about personal computing in small firms (Raymond 1990b).
Clearly,many factors influence personal computing acceptance (Adams et al. 1992; Davis
et al. 1989; DeLone and McLean1992; Igbaria
et al. 1995; Mathieson 1991; Moore and
Benbasat 1991; Straub et al. 1995; Szajna
1996; Taylorand Todd 1995; Thompson et al.
1991). The majority of these studies have
investigated the acceptance of technology in
large organizations.The present study sought
to extend previousresearch by investigatingin
a single study the factors affecting personal
computing acceptance among users in small
firms. Specifically,the objectives of the study
were (1) to develop a model of the determinants of personal computingacceptance and
(2) to examine both the direct and indirect
effects of these determinantsof acceptance.
The key factors selected for investigationare
based on either past factor studies of IS success or factors perceived to be importantin a
small business context. The research
described here used a structural equation
modelingtechnique to simultaneouslytest the
measurement and the structuralmodels. The
conceptual model guiding this study is
described in the next section.

Conceptual Modeland
Research Hypotheses
Personal computing is one part of the total
computingactivityof small firms. Good examples includethe use of spreadsheet and database software by professionals and managers
to prepare plans or analyze debtors, sales,
and costs (Raymondand Bergeron 1992). As
in large firms,this computingby professionals
and managers in small firms is often a matter
of personal choice. However, such relatively
voluntaryuse of computershas the potentialto
play an increasingly important role in small
firmsin enablingthem to compete successfully
and provide better service to customers.
Hence, the acceptance of personal computing

<-----Page 3----->Personal Computingin SmallFirms

has been established to be one of the critical
success factors in achieving business success
(Drucker1987). It is becoming a fundamental
part of the organizationalplan and strategy of
a small firm (Raymond and Bergeron 1992).
Therefore,to better predictor explain personal
computingacceptance, we need to understand
the factors affecting it. Thus user acceptance
was seen as the dependent variable for this
study. This differs from priorstudies of computing success in small firms where, typically,
a version of user satisfactionhas been used to
measure computing success at the organizational level (DeLone 1988; Montazemi 1988;
Raymond 1985; Soh et al. 1992; Yap et al.
1992).
Why are some users able to exhibit greater
acceptance of personal computing?The theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein and
Ajzen 1975) and the technology acceptance
model (TAM)(Davis et al. 1989) offer promising theoreticalbases for examiningthe factors
contributingto personal computingacceptance
in small firms.
Briefly,TAMadapted the generic TRA model
to the particulardomain of user acceptance of
computer technology. TAM replaced TRA's
attitudinaldeterminants,derived separately for
each behavior,witha set of two variables (i.e.,
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) employed in many computertechnology
acceptance contexts. Both models were found
to predict intentions and usage satisfactorily.
However, TAMwas found to be a much simpler and easier to use but more powerful
model of the determinantsof user acceptance
of computer technology. In addition, TAM's
attitudinaldeterminants outperformedTRA's
much larger set of measures. The theoretical
insights of TAMthus provide a strong basis
from which to examine factors contributingto
personal computing in small firms. Further,
TAMhas proven to be successful in predicting
and explainingusage across a varietyof systems. Althoughprovidinginsights into the user
acceptance of computer technology (Davis et
al., 1989), the research focused only on the
determinants of usage rather than on the
external factors affecting those determinants
(e.g., perceived usefulness and ease of use).

Further, there was no such study done to
examine the applicabilityon small firms.Thus,
this study sought to extend previous research
by bringing together TAM and other prior
research on technology acceptance in small
firms and investigating the network of multivariate relationshipsamong the factors affecting it in smallfirms.
Because personal computingacceptance has
received littlepriorattention,the study adopted
a two-phasedapproach:
Phase 1. Based on a review of the literature,
an initialresearch model was developed and
examined using eight case studies.
Phase 2. Based on the results of the eight
case studies and another review of the literature, a revised research model was developed
and tested based on a survey of 358 users
spread across 203 small firms.
Phase 1 is reported in Zinatelliet al. (1996),
with the focus on the results from case
research. The case data influencedphase 2 of
the study, whichis the focus of this paper.
The case data showed that many of the factors
that influenced personal computing acceptance in small firmswere similarto the factors
identifiedin large organizations.However, the
cases also identifiedthe significantinfluenceof
extraorganizationalfactors, including lack of
external support. Many inhibiting factors
emerged from the case study data, including
lack of internal and external support. These
results highlighted the fact that small firms
have special needs due to their uniqueorganizational characteristics. Furthermore, the
users in the case studies revealed low levels
of computer sophistication, thus indicating a
potential area for increased overall computer
sophisticationin small firms.
Figure 1 presents the model examined here.
The model represents an integration of the
theoretical perspectives and the case studies
discussed above and posits that personal
computingacceptance in small firmsis a function of perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness. These two factors are hypothesized to have a direct effect on personal com1997 281

<-----Page 4----->Personal Computingin Small Firms

puting acceptance in small firms. The model
also proposes that these two factors mediate
the effects of the intra-and extraorganizational
factors on personal computing acceptance.
The figureshows that the intra-and extraorganizational factors are expected to influence
personal computing acceptance indirectly
throughtheir effects on perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness. It should be noted
that, followingthe workof Adams et al. (1992)
and Straub et al. (1995), behavioralintentions
were excluded from our model. Szajna (1996)
also reportedthat perceived usefulness has a
direct effect on personal computing acceptance (i.e., self-report system usage) for the
post-implementation version. Further,based
on the revised model of TAM reported by
Szajna and by Adams et al., attitudes were
also excluded from our model. The networkof
relationshipsamong the variables in the model
and the rationalefor the proposed linkages are
explained in the followingsection.

Personal computingacceptance
Researchers have identifiedseveral indicators
of personal computing acceptance. The most
generallyaccepted measures of personal computingacceptance in small firms appear to be
user satisfaction (Montazemi1988; Raymond
1985, 1987, 1990b; Soh et al. 1992; Thong et
al. 1993; Yap et al. 1992) and system usage
(DeLone 1988; Soh et al. 1992). However,
system usage has been the primaryindicator
of technology acceptance (Adams et al. 1992;
Davis et al. 1989; Straub et al. 1995; Szajna
1996; Thompson et al. 1991). Further,"system
usage has a notable practicalvalue for managers interested in evaluatingthe impactof IT"
(Straub et al. 1995, p. 1328). Finally, as the
focus of the study was on voluntarycomputer
use ratherthan mandatoryuse, system usage
was used as an indicatorof personal computing acceptance. It is importantto note that system usage relatedto personal computingin its
entirety rather than to a specific application,
thus enhancing user comparability across
small firms.

Perceived usefulness
Davis (1989) defines perceived usefulness as
"the degree to which a person believes that
using a particularsystem wouldenhance his or
her job performance"(p. 320). The importance
of perceived usefulness as an importantfactor
derives fromthe TRAand TAMmodels, which
propose that perceivedusefulness affects computer usage due to the reinforcementvalue of
outcomes. Adams et al., Davis et al., Straubet
al., and Szajna reportedthat user acceptance
of computersystems is drivento a large extent
by perceived usefulness. Other studies have
also reportedthat perceivedusefulness is positively associated with system usage (Igbaria
1994; Thompson et al. 1991). Therefore, the
followinghypothesisis proposed.
H1. Perceived usefulness has a direct effect
on personal computing acceptance.

Perceived ease of use
Perceived ease of use "refersto the degree to
which a person believes that using a particular
system would be free of effort"(Davis 1989, p.
320). Davis et al. (1989) identifiedease of use
as an importantdeterminantof system usage
throughperceived usefulness. Davis suggests
that perceived ease of use may actually be a
causal antecedent to perceived usefulness.
Goodwin(1987) argues that the effective functionality of a system, i.e., perceived usefulness, depends on its usability,i.e., perceived
ease of use. Mathieson (1991) and Szajna
(1996) each reportedthat ease of use explains
a significant amount of the variance in perceived usefulness. Adams et al. (1992) found
that both perceived usefulness and perceived
ease of use are importantdeterminantsof system usage (mainlyin their first study). Similar
findings have been reported by Mathieson,
Rogers (1995), Straubet al., and Thompsonet
al. They suggest that, in additionto perceived
usefulness, usage is influenced by perceived
ease of use. Therefore,the followinghypotheses are proposed.

H2b. Perceived ease of use has a direct effect on personal computing acceptance.

The effect of exogenous variables
on personal computingacceptance
Priorresearch on IS implementationand small
firms has found that there are various exogenous controllable factors that influence technology acceptance (Davis et al. 1989; DeLone
1988; Igbaria 1993; Montazemi 1988;
Raymond 1988; 1990b; Soh et al. 1992;
Thomspon et al. 1991; Thong et al. 1993; Yap
et al. 1992). These exogenous factors are
expected to influence technology acceptance
indirectlythrough perceived ease of use and
perceived usefulness (Davis et al. 1989;
Szajna 1996). A better understandingof these
exogenous factors may enable practitionersto
formulate strategies for improving personal
computingacceptance.
The exogenous factors included both intraorganizational and extraorganizationalfactors.
The intraorganizational
factors were: (1) internal support, (2) internaltraining,and (3) manfacagement support.Two extraorganizational
tors were also includedin the model: (1) external supportand (2) externaltraining.By including both intra-and extraorganizationalfactors,
the form of the model thus providedan opportunity for further examination of the relative
importance to small firm computing of intraand extraorganizationalfactors (Thong et al.
1996).

Intraorganizationalfactors
Internal personal computing support: The
importance of internal personal computing
supportto the success of user computinghas
been highlighted in many studies (Amoroso
1988; Amoroso and Cheney 1991; Buyukkurt
and Vass 1993; Igbaria 1994). Researchers
284

MISQuarterly/September1997

reporta positive relationshipbetween personal
computing success and various internaluser
computing support services, mainly through
the informationcenter (Bergeron and Berube
1988; Bergeron et al. 1990; Miraniand King
1994; Vijayaramanand Ramakrishna 1990).
They reported that systems were more successful when there was user computing support. For most users, system success was
higherwhen more supportneeds were fulfilled.
Raymond(1990b) states that the level of computingsupportprovidedby the IS functionwas
crucialto the acceptance of end-user computing in small firms.However,in small firms,the
lack of resources and technical sophistication
precludesthe creationof an informationcenter
or PC support function. Littleinternalsupport
for personal computingis availableto users in
small firms(Zinatelliet al. 1996). Informalsupport, in the form of help from users in other
functionalareas, manuals, purchased books,
and help screens, is often the only formof support available. As a result, some small firms
relyon systems analysts/programmersfor supportfor personalcomputing.Forexample, both
Abdul-Gader(1992) and Montazemifound a
positiveassociation between personal computing acceptance and the number of analysts
present in small firms.Additionally,high levels
of technical support are thought to promote
more favorable beliefs about the system
among users and IS specialists and greater
personal computing success (Igbaria et al.
1995; Lucas 1978). TAMproposes that external factors, such as internaluser support, will
influence personal computing acceptance by
affectingperceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed.
H3a. Internal personal computing support
has a direct effect on perceived ease
of use.
H3b. Internal personal computing support has a direct effect on perceived
usefulness.
Internal personal computing training:
Raymond (1990b) states that personal com-

<-----Page 7----->Personal Computingin SmallFirms

puting trainingis an importantfactor affecting
personal computing acceptance in both small
and large firms. Prior research also reported
that trainingpromotes greater understanding,
favorable attitudes, more frequent use, and
more diverse use of applicationsin small firms
(Raymond 1988). It was also reported that
user training had a significant effect on the
decision-makingsatisfactionof small firmmanagers who develop their own applications
(Raymond and Bergeron 1992). Similarly,
trainingwas found to have a positive impacton
perceived usefulness (Igbaria et al. 1995;
Raymond 1988) and technology acceptance
(Amoroso 1988; Amoroso and Cheney 1991;
Igbariaet al. 1995; Nelson and Cheney 1987).
Based on TAM, it is expected that internal
computingtrainingaffects personal computing
acceptance indirectlythrough its influence on
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Therefore,the followinghypotheses are
proposed.
H4a. Internal personal computing training
has a direct effect on perceived ease
of use.
H4b. Internal personal computing training has a direct effect on perceived
usefulness.
Management support: Previous studies have
identifiedmanagement support as one of the
key recurringfactors affectingsystem success
(Cerveny and Sanders 1986; Igbaria 1994;
Kwon and Zmud 1987; Lucas 1981).
Management support is able to ensure sufficient allocation of resources and act as a
change agent to create a more conducive
environmentfor IS success. Therefore, management support is associated with greater
system success and lack of it is considered a
critical barrier to the effective utilization of
informationtechnology. Millerand Toulouse
(1986) found that, in small firms, the chief
executive officer(CEO)has a greaterinfluence
on a company's performance than does the
CEO of a largerfirm.The CEO of a small firm
usually has an "enormous impact-via his
power, his face-to-face contacts with virtually
all employees, his ownership,and the immedi-

ate effects of his expressed goals, perceptions
and preferences"(Millerand Toulouse 1986, p.
1393). This may suggest that management
supportmay be much more importantin small
firms where the owner or CEO is commonly
involvedin most key decisions and is perhaps
the only one who can harness information
technology to corporateobjectives and strategy. The primaryfinding of DeLone's (1988)
small-firmstudy was that the successful use of
computerswas stronglylinkedto CEO knowledge of computers and active involvementin
the computerization efforts. Yap et al. also
found a positive correlationbetween IS success and CEO support.Abdul-Gaderconcluded that management support had a positive
influence on computing acceptance.
Additionally,TAMproposes that organizational
support, one of the external factors, affects
perceived usefulness as well as perceived
ease of use. Igbariaet al. (1995) foundsupport
for the relationshipbetween managementsupport and perceived usefulness. Therefore,the
followinghypotheses are proposed.
H5a. Management support has a direct
effect on perceived ease of use.
H5b. Management support has a direct
effect on perceived usefulness.

factors
Extraorganizational
External computing support and training:
Raymond(1990b) proposed that the availability and quality of external computing support
could be considered as a very importantdeterminant of personal computing success for
small firms. Cragg and King found that small
firmswere very relianton the advice and supportfrom external sources, includingvendors.
Such reliance on external help was due to
insufficientinternaltechnicalexpertise. Indeed,
previous research has established the positive
role that external support can play in helping
small firmsbe more competitive.
Raymond(1990b) states that small firms look
to externalsources for technical support,such
1997 285
MISQuarterly/September

<-----Page 8----->Personal Computingin Small Firms

as small business consultingcenters operated
by governmentagencies, universities,or computer vendors. Similarly, small firms could
potentiallyrely on the same external sources
for training.Consultants and vendors provide
consultancy services specificallyto help small
firms successfully introduce and implement
informationsystems. They can assist in analyzing requirements, selecting the hardware
and software, user training,technical support,
and projectmanagement.
Gable (1991) and Kole (1983) found that the
experience and capabilities of the consultants
plays an importantrole in IS success in small
firms. Other studies have found that personal
computing success can be achieved through
an external computer bureau staffed with IS
specialists knowledgeable about small firm
needs and constraints (Montazemi 1988).
Raymond and Bergeron also proposed that
personal computing success could be determined by the support provided by external
sources. This was empirically supported by
Yap et al., where they found that personal
computing success was positively associated
with the level of vendor support, including
trainingand technical support, given to small
firms. Thong et al. (1993) concluded that the
level of IS effectiveness was higher in firms
with a high level of vendor supportthan those
with a low level of vendor support.They concluded that small firms with external support,
mainly consultants, had higher levels of system success. However,TAMproposes thatthe
externalfactors, such as the extraorganizational factors, will affect personal computing
acceptance indirectlythrough their effects on
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Therefore, the followinghypotheses are
proposed.
H6a. External computing support has a
direct effect on perceived ease of use
H6b. External computing support has a
direct effect on perceived usefulness
H7a. External computing training has a
direct effect on perceived ease of use
286

H7b. External computing training has a

To summarize, our intent is to assess the
validityof the research model in a small-firm
context in orderto develop an appreciationof
the relative contributionsof the model's constructs. Thus, the analysis and discussion
focuses on the overall relationshipswithinthe
variables (the measurement model) as well as
the relationships among the variables (the
structuralmodel) and the roles of the mediating variablesin influencingpersonalcomputing
acceptance. The research model is depicted in
Figure1.

Research Methodology
Sample and procedure
Data for this study were collected using a
questionnaire survey administered in New
Zealand during 1994. As computer usage differs by industrytype (Kaganet al. 1990), firms
from only two, closely related industrysectors
were investigated: manufacturing and engineering.This provideda large sample of small
firms in New Zealand (Hamiltonand English
1993). In this study, small firms were defined
as having between 20 to 100 employees. This
definitionis based on Bollard's (1984) study
and is consistent with many other studies of
small firmcomputing(Soh et al. 1992; Yap et
al. 1992). In addition,only independent small
firms (i.e., not subsidiaryfirms)were included
in the study. The names and addresses of the
small firms were obtained from the New
Zealand Business Who's Who Directory.

Based on the above criteria,726 small firms
were identified. Initially,the 726 companies
received a letterexplainingthe purpose of the
research projectand inquiringabout the firm's
willingnessto participatein the study. Foreach
company, a contact person was identifiedand
asked to provide the names and job titles of
the company's computer users. Responses
from 504 firms were received (69% response
rate).The responses includedthe following:36

<-----Page 9----->Personal Computingin SmallFirms

10 ceased trading/
refusal/incomplete,
unreachable, 128 under 20 employees, 22
over 100 employees, 38 subsidiary, and 79
with no computer users. Note that, as two of
the criteriafor participationin the study were
not met by some firms, the total number of
non-usable returns(301) is less than the total
number of firms discussed above. The total
number of small firms that agreed to participate in the study and also fullymet the study's
criteria was 203, with a median size of 38
employees. Over 50% of the 203 firms had
between one and fourcomputerusers per firm.
In addition, over 30% of the firms had more
than five computerusers.
Participationin the study was voluntary and
people were assured that their individual
responses would be treated as confidential.
Questionnaires were mailed to the 773 users
who had been identified by the contact persons in the 203 firms. A total of 596 users
responded, giving an initial response rate of
77%. Many replies contained missing data, so
they were excluded. Also, 85 users identified
themselves as having clerical/secretarialpositions. These 85 were excluded from the final
sample as their use of computerswas likelyto
be mandatoryratherthan voluntary(Hiltzand
Johnson 1989) and thus outside the scope of
the technology acceptance model. This resulted in a final sample of 358 users, a response
rate of 60%. The high response rate was probably helped by the presence of a contact person withineach firm.
The majorityof the respondents held middleor
lower management positions (51.8%); the
remaining held non-supervisory positions
(33.9%) and top management positions
(14.3%).A total of 12%were the top managers
in their companies. Users came from a range
of functional areas, including: accounting or
finance (24%), administrative(12%), manufacturing/production(11%), management (11%),
sales (8%), engineering (4%), and marketing
(2%).
Of the users, 54.2% were males, and 45.8%
were females. Theirages rangedfrom19 to 69
with an average of 38.43 years (S.D. = 11.06).
Of the participants,71% did not have a univer-

sity education; the majority of respondents
(37.3%) had obtained a polytechnicqualification, and 32.8% had high school only. The
majorityof the users were employed in firms
with fewer than 50 employees (75.7%). Also,
the majorityof users were employed in firms
that were at least 25 years old.
The sophisticationof end users was examined
based on the Rockart and Flannery (1983)
classification.The majorityof users (81%) fell
into the nonprogrammingand command level
categories, indicatinga very low level of personal computingsophisticationin small firms.
Personal computers were used by a majority
of respondents; approximately 69% of the
respondentsindicatedthat they use a personal
computer to do most of their computer work.
Respondents had extensive experience with
software packages (49%), such as spreadsheets and wordprocessors. Most of the users
(over 70%) reportedlittleor no experience with
buildingmodels and programmingwith fourth

consistent with the results of previous studies
of smallfirmcomputing.

Measures
Personal computing acceptance. Based on
several studies (Davis et al. 1989; Igbariaet al.
1995; Straub et al. 1995; Szajna 1996;
Thompson et al. 1991), system usage was
selected as the primaryindicatorof personal
computingacceptance.
System usage. Followingthe recommendation of Fishbeinand Ajzen and to improvereliability, usage was measured by multiple-act
indicators (i.e., different acts indicating the
same behavior)ratherthan a single-act indicator. Based on several studies (Cheney and
Dickson 1982; DeLone 1988; Igbaria et al.
1989; Soh et al. 1992; Straubet al. 1995), four
indicators of system usage were included in
this study:
1. The number of differentsoftware applications used. Most users in a microcomputer

environment have a wide variety of packages to use. In such an environment,the
differentsoftware packages can provide a
good indicationof overall usage and of the
varietyof tasks performedon the computer.
Thus, respondents were asked to indicate
which packages they used from a list of
eight generic packages (e.g., spreadsheet,
data management,wordprocessing, etc.).

withinan organizationalcontext " (Davis 1989,
p. 320). The items used to constructthe perceived usefulness measure were adapted from
Davis et al., with appropriatemodificationsto
make them specifically relevant to personal
computing.Individualswere asked to indicate
the extent of agreement or disagreement with
the four statements concerning computers on
a five-pointLikert-typescale rangingfrom (1)
stronglydisagree to (5) stronglyagree.

2. The number of computer supported business tasks. The computer supported business tasks performedby the user is also an
indicator of computer usage. Ten tasks,
such as making decisions, looking for
trends, planning, and budgeting, were
defined and participantswere asked to indicate whether they personally used a computerto performthese tasks.

Perceived ease of use. Based on Davis, perceived ease of use refers to the degree to
whichcomputertechnology is perceived as relativelyeasy to understandand use. This measure was adapted from Davis, et al., with
appropriatemodificationsto make it specifically relevantto personal computing. Individuals
were asked to indicatethe extent of agreement
or disagreementwithfourstatements concerning computers on a five-point scale ranging
from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly
agree.

3. The actual amount of time spent on the
microcomputersystem per day. Based on
Lee's (1986) study, individualswere asked
to indicatethe amount of time spent on the
microcomputerper day, using a six point
scale rangingfrom (1) "almostnever"to (6)
"morethan three hours per day."
4. Frequency of use of microcomputers.
Frequency of use has been proposed by
Raymond(1985) for providinga perspective
on use slightly different from actual time
spent. Frequency of use was measured on
a six point scale rangingfrom (1) "less than
once a month"to (6) "severaltimes a day."
These four indicatorsare typicalof the kindof
self-reported measures often used to operationalize system usage, particularlyin cases
where objective use and acceptance metrics
are not available. Self-reportedusage should
not be regardedas a precise measure of actual usage, althoughprevious research suggests
it is appropriateas a relative measure (Blair
and Burton1987).
This measure is

Intraorganizationalfactors. Three constructs
were identifiedas potentialintraorganizational
factorsaffectinguser computingsuccess. First,
internaluser computingsupport is defined as
the technicalsupportby individuals(or groups)
withcomputerknowledgewho were internalto
the small firm.This constructwas operationalized using a scale adapted from Amoroso,
Igbaria (1993), and Thompson et al. Both
Amoroso and Igbaria used instruments that
included items on the support provided by
informationcenters. Since small firms would
generally not have informationcenters, the
instrument by Thompson et al., which was
based on Amoroso'swork,was selected as the
most appropriatemeasure in a small firmcontext. The internalsupportconstructconsisted of
four items that measured the availability of
technicalassistance and specialized instruction
on a five point Likertscale ranging from (1)
"stronglydisagree"to (5) "stronglyagree"concerning internalsupport. In particular,respondents were asked to indicatethe level of internal support provided to them by computer
users or computerspecialists in the company.
Second, internaltrainingrefers to the amount
of trainingprovidedby othercomputerusers or

computerspecialists in the company (Amoroso
1988; Amoroso and Cheney 1991). The case
data showed that the most popular software
packages among the participantswere application packages (e.g., accounting and payroll
packages), word processing and spreadsheets. Thus, we focused on four areas: internal trainingin operating systems, application
packages, word processing, and spreadsheet.
Participants indicated their internal training

surementof internaltraining,the study focused
on four areas of training:operating systems,
spreadsheet, wordprocessing, and application
packages. Participantsindicatedtheir external
traininglevel on a five-pointscale rangingfrom
(1) "never"to (5) "toa very great extent."(See
the Appendix for a fuller description of the
study variables.)

Third,management support refers to the perceived level of general support offered by top
management in small firms. Individualswere
asked to indicate the extent of agreement or
disagreement with four statements concerning
management encouragement and allocationof
resources for personal computing,taken from
Igbaria (1990), on a five-point scale ranging
from (1) "strongly disagree" to (5) "strongly
agree."

The research model depicted in Figure 1 was
analyzed using PartialLeast Squares (PLS), a
powerfulapproachto studyingstructuralmodels involvingmultipleconstructs with multiple
indicators.PLS is a second-generation multivariate technique that facilitatestesting of the
psychometricpropertiesof the scales used to
measure a variable, as well as estimation of
the parametersof a structuralmodel, i.e., the
strength and direction of the relationships
among the model variables. It embodies two
sets of equations. The structural equations

indicators/items and the variables that they
measure.

Extraorganizational factors. Two constructs
were identifiedas potentialextraorganizational
factors affecting personal computing acceptance. First, external computing support was
defined as the technical supportby individuals
(or groups) with computer knowledge who
were external to the small firm.Various measures of externalsupport,includingvendorand
consultant support, have been used in previous studies (Gable 1991; Thong et al. 1993;
Yap et al. 1992). However, these measures
focused primarilyon project specific support
from either vendors or consultants. We wanted, in this study, to capture the amount of
external support for personal computingfrom
all possible external sources. Respondents
were asked to indicatetheir agreement or disagreement to the level of externalsupportprovided to them by friends,vendors, consultants,
or other external sources on a five-pointLikert
scale ranging from (1) "stronglydisagree" to
(5) "stronglyagree."
External computing trainingwas the second
extraorganizational factor. It refers to the
amount of training provided by friends, vendors, consultants, or educational institutions
external to the company. Similarto the mea-

Data analysis

PLS allows the researcherto test the relationships withinthe measures (the measurement
model) and the hypothesized relationships
between the measures (the structuralmodel)
simultaneously(Fornell1982; Lohmoller1989;
Wold 1982). For each variable included in
Figure 1, there is a related measurement
model,which linksmeasures to a set of items.
The test of the measurement model includes
estimation of the reliabilitycoefficients (composite reliability)of the measures, as well as
an examination of the convergent and discriminantvalidityof the research instruments.
In determiningthe appropriateminimumloadings requiredfor the inclusionof an item within a scale, we used Fornell'srecommendation
to retain items that loaded highly on their
respective measures. A variancee of 0.70 is
considered to be a high loadingsince the item

ticularmeasure. Fornell and Larcker's(1981)
criterion that an average extracted variance
should be .50 or more was used to assess the
average variance extracted for all measures.
We also used the guidelines recommended
by Hair et al. (1995) in determiningthe relative importance and significance of the factor
loading of each item, i.e., loadings greater
than .30 are considered significant; loadings
greater than .40 are considered more important; and loadings .50 or greater are considered to be very significant. Finally,the criteria
suggested by Nunnally(1978) were applied to
determine the adequacy of the reliabilitycoefficients obtained for each measure.
To assess discriminant validity of the measures, i.e., the degree to which items differentiate among measures or measure distinctconcepts, we examined the correlationsbetween
the measures of potentiallyoverlappingmeasures (Grant 1989). If the items associated
with a measure correlate more highly with
each other than with items associated with
other measures in the model (Fornell et al.
1982), the measure is determinedto have adequate discriminantvalidity.
The computer programused for this analysis
was LVPLS 1.6 (Latent Variables Path
Analysis using Partial Least Squares), developed by Lohmoller(1981, 1989). To test the
estimated path coefficients, t-statistics were
calculated using a nonparametrictest of significance known as jackknifing (Tukey 1958;
Wildtet al. 1982).
The test of the structuralmodel included estimating the path coefficients, which are interpreted as standardized beta weights in a
regression analysis, and R2, which is used to
assess the proportion of variance in the
endogenous constructs which can be
accounted for by the antecedents. The path
coefficient of an exogenous variable represents the direct effect of that variable on the
endogenous variable. An indirecteffect represents the effect of a particularvariableon the
second variable through its effects on a third
mediating variable. It is the product of the
path coefficients along an indirectroute from
cause to effect via tracingarrows in the head290

ed directiononly. When more than one indirect path exists, the total indirecteffect is their
sum. The sum of the direct and indirecteffect
reflects the total effect of the variable on the
endogenous variable (Alwin and Hauser
1975; Ross 1975).

Results
The measurement model
First,it was necessary to assess the properties
of the measurementmodel. The results of the

Table 1. The data show that the measures
examined in this study are robust in terms of
their internalconsistency reliabilityas indexed
by the composite reliability.The composite reliabilities of the differentmeasures included in

the recommendedvalues in Nunnally'sguidelines. All of the measures possessed adequate

items representing other measures. Further,
consistent withthe recommendationsof Fornell
and Larcker,average variance extractedfor all
measures exceeded 0.50. An examination of
the individualitem loadingsand reliabilitiesindicated highloadingsforall measures.
Table 2 presents the intercorrelationsamong
the study variables. In all of the 28 entries
examined,the squared correlations,representing the shared varianceamong variables,were
found not to exceed the average variance

are distinct and unidimensionalmeasures. In
summary, the convergent and discriminant

Tests of the structuralmodel
The results of the multivariatetest of the structural model are presented in Tables 3 and 4.
Both tables show the path coefficients, which
are the standardized regression coefficients.
The tables also show values for R2, i.e., the
amount of variance explained in perceived
ease of use, perceived usefulness, and system
usage. Table 3 shows that the explained variance in perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness were 4% and 30%, respectively.
Table 4 shows that the model as a whole
explained 25% of the variance (p < .001) in
personal computing acceptance, i.e. system

Figure 2 illustrates many of the significant
structuralrelationshipsamong the study variables. Consistent with hypotheses 1 (H1) and
2 (H2b), perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness are both positively related to personal computing acceptance. The data show
that perceived usefulness (H1) and perceived
ease of use (H2b) have a strong direct effect
on usage (B = .29 and .31, respectively, p <
.001). Perceived ease of use, consistent with
H2a, also has a strong direct effect on perceived usefulness (13= .29, p < .001). Itshould
be noted that perceived ease of use has a significant indirect effect on system usage
throughperceived usefulness.

The effects of the extraorganizationalfactors
(externaluser computingsupportand external
training) and two intraorganizationalfactors
(internaltrainingand managementsupport)on
system usage are indirectthrough perceived
ease of use and perceived usefulness.
Inconsistentwith hypotheses 3a and 3b, internal user computingsupport has no significant
effects on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. However, partial support
was found for hypotheses 4a and 4b. While
internal training has positive effects on perceived usefulness (H4b) (y = .08, p < .05), it
has no significanteffects on perceived ease of
use (H4a). Additionally,the data confirm the

importance of management support in influencing perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness directly,and system usage indirectly. Consistent with hypotheses 5a and 5b,
management support has positive direct
effects on perceived ease of use (H5a) and
perceived usefulness (H5b) (y = .07 and .24, p
< .05, respectively).Managementsupportalso
has a significant indirect effect on usage,
mainlythroughperceived usefulness.

of

no significant effect on perceived usefulness
(H7b), it has a positive direct effect on perceived ease of use (y = .14, p < .05). It is also
noted that both factors have positive indirect
effects on perceivedsystem usage throughperceived ease of use and perceivedusefulness.
To sum up, the tests of the structuralmodel
show that perceived ease of use and usefulness are the dominantfactors affectingsystem
usage. Perceived ease of use and management support have the strongest effects on
perceived usefulness. The data also show that
external computingsupportand externalcomputing training moderately affect perceived
ease of use. The results also demonstratethe
importanceof perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in mediating the relationships of the intra-and extraorganizationalfactors on personalcomputingacceptance.

Discussion
This study integratedthe theoretical perspectives and empiricalfindingsof research on personal computingacceptance in small firmsand
proposed and tested a structural equation
model examiningthe role of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and the intraand extraorganizationalfactors in promoting
personal computingacceptance in small firms.

TAMwas expanded by examining both intraand extraorganizationalvariables. It was also
extended to a small business context, whereas
most previousresearch has tested it with large
firms or college students. The results indicate
moderate support for the proposed linkages
among the model variables and provide interesting insights into the routes through which
the antecedent variables influence personal
computing acceptance. The results demonstrate the relative contribution of perceived
ease of use and perceived usefulness to variation in personal computing acceptance. The
findingsreiteratethe key mediatingrole of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness
in promotingpersonal computingacceptance,
i.e., system usage, and demonstrate the utilitarian and rationalunderpinningsof the decision to use systems in small firms. That is to
say, individualsare likelyto use the system if
they believe that it is easy to use and that
using it will increase their performance and
productivity.
Inconsistent with prior research (Davis et al.
1989), the total effect of perceived ease of use
is greater than the total effect of perceived
usefulness on usage. This may suggest that
small business users are driven to accept
computer technologies primarilyon the basis
of ease of use and user friendlinessand secondarilybecause of the functions it performs
for them. Although users may be willing to
cope with some difficultiesif the system provides them with importantneeded information
in theirjob, this resultsuggests that users who
have difficultiesusing the system may be discouraged from using the system and may not
be able to observe the perceived benefits from
it. This emphasizes the importance of both
perceived ease of use and functionality in
developingsystems.
A possible explanationis that a user's level of
experience with the system may influencethe
relative importanceof perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness. Our survey indicated that the majority of users (over 75%)
reported no experience with creating programs using a query language or fourthgeneration language and/or third generation languages. The effect of ease of use on system

<-----Page 17----->Personal Computingin SmallFirms

usage is significantearly in the use of the system, particularlyin a less sophisticated small
firmcontext; its effect becomes non-significant
after more prolonged exposure (Adams et al.
1992; Davis et al. 1989). The evolution of
informationsystems fromtransactionprocessing to DSS to ES and KBS is progressing at a
slower rate in small firmswhen comparedwith
largerfirms (Kagan et al. 1990). A reason for
this may be that these systems are as yet too
costly and the needed expertise in both applications and internalpersonnel are not readily
available to small firms. Further research
needs to examine the differences in the relative importanceof perceived ease of use and
perceived usefulness at differentstages of the
growthmodel (Nolan 1973), i.e., whether perceived ease of use is an importantdeterminant of early adoption but is less importantin
explaining the level of post-adoption usage.
Szajna suggests that a "futureresearch area
for the TAMlies in determiningthe value and
status of an experience component" (p. 91).
Followingthe suggestion, these issues require
furtherinvestigation.
The findings indicate that perceived ease of
use is a key intervening variable linkingthe
exogenous variables-intra- and extraorganizational factors-with perceived usefulness
and personal computing acceptance. The
importanceof perceived ease of use is further
illustratedby its directeffect on system usage.
The positive effect of external trainingon perceived ease of use suggests that trainingmay
enhance a person's self efficacy and serve to
demystify personal computing. This suggests
that trainingprogramsshould foster an individual's self confidence and perceptionconcerning the system. Individualswithout adequate
training are likely to experience problems
using the system. Since they are struggling,
they may actually believe that the system is
too hardto use and that the performancebenefits of usage are outweighed by the efforts of
using it and eventually become reluctant to
use the technology, thus defeatingthe purpose
of introducingthe new technology.
Inconsistent with our hypotheses (H3a and
H3b) and with most previous IS research in
large firms(Abdul-Gader1992; Amoroso 1988;

Buyukkurtand Vass 1993; Igbariaet al. 1995;
Rivard and Huff 1988), no relationship was
found between internalsupport and perceived
ease of use and perceived usefulness. These
results may be a result of the small-firmcontext under investigation in the present study.
For example, DeLone (1988) found that the
availability of technical support, mainly for
trainingpurposes, did not result in greater IS
success in a small firmcontext. Since very few
small firms in this study employ internalcomputer specialists, it is likelythat the qualityof
the services provided by them may not have
been very high. Additionally,since a lack of
resources makes it impossible for small firms
to establish internal Information centers,
Raymond(1990b) proposed that the availability and qualityof externalsupportcould be considered as a more relevantdeterminantof personal computingacceptance in small firms.
Internaltraining,which refers to the amount of
trainingusers had received fromother users or
computer specialists within the firm, had a
direct effect on perceived usefulness, consistent withhypothesis (H4b).However,the effect
of internaltrainingon ease of use was not supported (H4a). It should be noted that many
users reported receiving no internal training
(57%).Furthermore,internaltrainingwas highly correlatedwith internalsupport, which may
partiallyexplainthe insignificanteffect of internal support. It seems possible that, in the
absence of internal training, users strive to
make use of systems based on theirperceived
usefulness, regardless of their ease of use.
However, it was found that a lack of training
caused user frustration(Zintanelliet al. 1996).
This suggests that future research should
focus on the effects of internal training and
supportin small firms.The significanteffect of
internal training on perceived usefulness
emphasizes the need for small firmsto provide
trainingfor users to encourage them to use a
greaterdiversityof softwarefor a widervariety
of tasks.
The importance of management support in
promotinggreater personal computingacceptance has been well-recognized (Guimaraes
and Ramanujam 1986; Leitheiser and
Wetherbe 1986). Consistent with our hypothe1997 295
MISQuarterly/September

<-----Page 18----->Personal Computingin Small Firms

ses (H5a and H5b), managementsupportpositivelyaffected perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Management support can
take a varietyof forms such as encouragement
to use the system, providinga wider selection
of user-friendlysoftware of special use to different jobs, offering educational programs,
applying informationtechnology to support a
widervarietyof business tasks, and encouraging experimentation with microcomputers.
Features that enhance the potentialfor higher
perceived usefulness could be instrumentalin
stimulatingmore extensive usage.
Consistent with our hypotheses (H6a and
H6b), external support has a direct positive
effect on perceived ease of use and perceived
usefulness. This is also consistent with
Raymond's (1990b) propositionthat the availability of external support is an important
determinantof personal computingacceptance
in small firms.This suggests that externalsupport combined with management support are
importantfactors that can contributeto effective personal computing implementation in
small firms.Adequate and high qualityexternal
support can help users understand and use
informationsystems effectively. Additionally,
good relationshipsbetween users and external
support providers,such as vendors or consultants, can help users develop positive feelings
and more realistic expectations from the IS
implementation,resultingin increased system
usage. In essence, with good externalsupport
in the formof technical support,training,and a
harmonious working relationship, the risk of
user computingfailureis lowered. Further,due
to insufficient internal technical expertise,
small firmsare expected to engage some form
of external computing expertise. Our findings
show that the external support has a much
stronger influence on personal computing
acceptance than internalsupport.This is consistent with the findings of Cragg and King:
withlittleinternalcomputingexpertise and support,small firmsare very relianton theirexternal support.
Consistent with our hypothesis H7a, external
training has a positive effect on perceived
ease of use. However, its effect on perceived
usefulness is only indirectthrough perceived
296

MISQuarterly/September1997

ease of use. This suggests that external educational and training programs designed to
increase individuals'knowledgeabout computers and their operations may be beneficial in
enhancing computerskills and reducingattitudinal barriersto the acceptance of computer
technology. Changes in the mode of delivery
of instruction and training may be useful in
developing individuals'skills in using microcomputers, which in turn will enhance usage
throughits effects on perceived ease of use. In
this study, external training measured the
amount of training individuals had received
from external sources, which included other
computerusers, friends, vendors, consultants,
or educationalinstitutionsexternalto the company. This finding supports the notion that
small firms could potentially rely on external
sources of support for training. Similarly,
Montazemiidentifieda growing need for educational institutions to offer in-depth IS programs specificallydesigned for small firms.
The results are not totallyconsistent with the
findingsof Thong et al. (1996), who compared
the effects of management supportand external IS expertise on IS effectiveness in small
firms.They concludedthat both variableswere
important,with external IS expertise as most
critical.Our results confirmthat both variables
are important,but that management support
had the greatest influence. These differing
conclusions could be due to the use of different dependent variables;our study focused on
personal computingacceptance, while Thong
et al. studied user satisfaction, organizational
impact,and IS effectiveness.
Although this study provides interesting
insights into the factors affecting personal
computing acceptance in small firms, the
results must be interpretedcautiously. First,
the model variablesexplained25% of the variance in system usage. The fact that 75% of
the variance is unexplainedsuggests the need
for additionalresearch incorporatingpotential
variables that were not measured in the current study. Importantamong these are user
participationand involvement, organizational
characteristics, and task characteristics
(DeLone 1988; Raymond 1990b; Raymond
and Bergeron 1992; Zinatelli et al. 1996).

<-----Page 19----->Personal Computingin Small Firms

Second, although the structuralmodel results
generallysupportmany of our hypotheses, the
use of self-reportscales to measure ihe study
variables suggests the possibilitythat common
method variance may account for some of the
results obtained. Some caution is warrantedin
interpretingthe results because all measures
were obtained from users in small firms using
a single questionnaire. The authors believe
that the results of validityand reliabilitytests
carriedout and discussed earlierargue for sufficient confidence in the study measures, but
that a similarstudy with multimethod,multitrait
measurements should yield more powerful
results. Third,while the findings of this study
apply only to small firms in the manufacturing
and engineeringsectors, the generalizabilityof
these results to other sectors remains to be
determined.Additionally,cross-sectional studies such as the present one are useful in identifyingthe patterns of relationshipsamong the
relevant variables, but longitudinal research
design is essential to confirmthe causal linkages among the study variables.The strengths
of the findingswould also be enhanced by the
use of both subjective as well as objective
measures of personal computing acceptance.
Finally,furtherresearch should also examine
the impact of personal computingacceptance
on the performance of small firms, as proposed by DeLone and McLean.

Implicationsfor Research
and Practice
The final model has a number of implications
for research and practice. The results confirmedthat perceived usefulness has a strong
direct effect on use. This suggests that the
functionalityof a system must be emphasized
to potentialusers. Researchers can help determine ways to do this effectively,and the model
indicates that efforts should focus initiallyon
greater internaltraining,management support,
and external support. Education and training
programsshould aim to increase awareness of
potentialapplicationsand emphasize the benefits of using computers. Also, software developers must address usefulness, not only ease

of use, as an importantdesign objectivewhen
developingsystems.
Ease of use also had a directeffect on use, as
well as an indirecteffect via perceived usefulness. This suggests that efforts to improve
perceived ease of use could have a strong
influenceon personalcomputingin small firms.
For example, computertrainingcould be used
to influence perceived ease of use by improving the self-efficacy(Bandura1982) of computer users.
Internaltraining rather than internal support
had a positive influenceon use. This highlights
the need for small firmsto providetrainingfor
users to encourage them to use a greater
diversity of software for a wider variety of
tasks. Another internalfactor of even greater
importance was management support.
Researchers could seek ways to strengthen
management support for personal computing
in small firms.This may indicatethat vendors,
consultants, and educational institutions
should provideformalcomputereducation and
training programs specifically designed for
small-firmmanagers.
External support had a strong influence on
use. Furthermore, external support had a
much greater effect on use than internalsupport.To a lesser extent, externaltraininghad a
stronger effect on use than internal training.
These results highlighta strong need for consultants and vendors to assist small firms in
their computing efforts. However, small firms
are reluctantto hireconsultantsbecause of the
costs and associated risks (Zinatelli et al.
1996). Also, vendors and consultantsare often
reluctant to provide services to small firms
because of the low potential for profit.Thus,
strategies are requiredto make external support more profitablefor vendors and consultants and at the same time more affordablefor
small firms.
A possible strategy could involve small firms
employing vendors or consultants as a parttime external IS manager. The external IS
manager could provide IS support on a regular, possibly monthly, basis for each firm. In
addition,support and trainingsessions could

be made availableto firmsthroughan external
informationcenter that could be utilized and
funded by many small firms.Alternatively,this
external informationcenter could be operated
by a governmentagency (forexample, a small
business development center) or an educational institution.Researchers could examine
the effectiveness of such strategies aimed at
providingexternalsupportto small firms.

Conclusion
This study presents significant progress
towardexplainingthe factors affectingpersonal computing acceptance in small firms. It
aimed to investigate the effects of intra-and
extraorganizationalfactors on personal computing acceptance and the role of perceived
ease of use and perceived usefulness in mediating these relationships. The findings are
encouraging and providetheoreticaland practical insights into personal computing acceptance in a small firmcontext. The study found
considerable support for TAM in small firms.
Perceived ease of use was found to be a more
importantdeterminantof personal computing
acceptance than perceived usefulness, a
result that is not consistent with priorresearch
in large firms.This may be due to the fact that
small firmsin New Zealand may be in the early
stages of technology adoption. The results
also confirmed management support and
external support as the two most significant
exogenous variables.This findingsupportsthe
call for more efforts to be directed at combining initiatives by management and external
providersto achieve greater personal computing acceptance.
