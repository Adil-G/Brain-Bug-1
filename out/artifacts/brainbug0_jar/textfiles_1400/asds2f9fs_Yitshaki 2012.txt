This study examines the relationships between relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in the cooperation of their venture capitalist (VC) investors.
Based on quantitative data collected from 120 Israeli high tech entrepreneurs,
the ﬁndings indicate that relational norms between entrepreneurs and VCs (i.e.,
shared beliefs and perceived similarities) are positively associated with
entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation. However, it was found
that VCs’ strategic involvement mediates the positive relationship between
relational norms and entrepreneurs conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation,
whereas VCs’ managerial involvement mediates the negative relationship
between relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation.
These ﬁndings are supported by six interviews made with entrepreneurs. The
ﬁndings extend the current literature by indicating that although relational
norms serve as a prime criterion for selecting between investment opportunities
by VCs, they cannot ensure relational continuity over time as entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation is mediated by VCs’ involvement. The
ﬁndings also suggest that entrepreneurs consider ‘the optimal balance’ between
relational norms and control as aligned with strategic rather managerial
involvement.

Introduction

Venture capitalists’ (VCs) perception of their relations with their portfolio
companies is well-examined in the literature (Sapienza and Korsgaard 1996;
De Clercq and Sapienza 2001, 2006; Neergaard and Ulhøi 2006). In contrast to
these studies, this study focuses on examining entrepreneurs’ perceptions about the
interrelations between relational norms and relational continuity as expressed by
their conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation. This paper seeks to extend insights from other
studies (Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001) by making an empirical examination of how
relational norms between VCs and entrepreneurs (Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay
2000) impact entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation. More speciﬁcally,
this paper focus on examining how VCs’ strategic and managerial mediate the

relations between relational norms (i.e., shared beliefs and perceived similarities) and
entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation.
Agency theory suggests that the VC–entrepreneur relationship is best managed
by employing formal contracts to defend the interests of the VCs from potentially
deleterious activity on the part of those receiving the funding. In the context of
venture capital investments, agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976) in particular
emphasizes how VCs can best formally govern their relations with entrepreneurs
through the use of monitoring, bonding, and incentives (Amit, Glosten, and
Muller 1990; Ruhnka and Young 1991; Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996;
Amit, Brander, and Christoph 1998). Following the agency theory perspective, the
relations between VCs and entrepreneurs are managed and controlled formally
(Sahlman 1990). However, it is argued that this perspective tends to neglect the
potential upside available in this relationship (Arthurs and Busenitz 2003),
particularly after the formal contract has been established.
Alternatively, the ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ perspective suggests that the relations
between VCs and entrepreneurs are examined from the aspect of the parties’
motivation to cooperate, rather than to act opportunistically in order to maximize
their gain (Cable and Shane 1997). However, under conditions of high interdependence between the unique capital and knowledge of both parties as well as
process and outcome uncertainty, conﬁdence in cooperation becomes crucial, as
relations cannot be fully controlled formally (Cable and Shane 1997). Previous
studies suggest that the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs (VC-E) relationship is
impacted more signiﬁcantly through reciprocal relations and interaction, rather than
through formal control mechanisms (Sapienza and Korsgaard 1996; De Clercq and
Sapienza 2001, 2006; Busenitz, Fiet, and Moesel 2004; Weber and Göbel 2005).
A recent study (Murnieks et al. 2011) indicates that VCs’ investment decisions are
interaction-biased as their perceived cognitive similarity with the venture founders
inﬂuence the attractiveness of investment opportunities. However, relational
management requires cognitive similarities over time in order to obtain relational
continuity. The current literature indicates that VCs’ and entrepreneurs’ relations
can be best managed based on relational norms as well as by control actions
(Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001). Therefore, although relational norms constitute
cognitive understanding and expectations for the nature of cooperation at the preinvestment stage, they may be inﬂuenced by VCs’ actual involvement. Furthermore,
while high relational norms between VCs and entrepreneurs may decrease
opportunistic behavior and therefore the need of formal control (Joshi and Arnold
1997), low relational norms may be associated with high formal control that can
inhibit relational continuity (Macaulay 2000).
Based on quantitative data collected from 120 Israeli high tech entrepreneurs and
qualitative data based on six interviews, the ﬁndings indicate that entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation is mediated by the nature of the VCs’ involvement. It
was found that VCs’ strategic involvement mediates the positive relations between
relational norms (i.e., shared beliefs and perceived similarities) and entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation. On the other hand, the ﬁndings indicate that
VCs’ managerial involvement mediates the negative relations between relational
norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation.
The ﬁndings of this study extend the current literature regarding relational
management between VCs and entrepreneurs and relational continuity. Although
relational norms serve VCs as a prime consideration for investment selection

<-----Page 4----->Venture Capital

(Murnieks et al. 2011), low relational norms over time are negatively associated with
relational continuity. In addition, the ﬁndings also contribute to the venture capital
literature by indicating that entrepreneurs consider ‘the optimal balance’ (Shepherd
and Zacharakis 2001) between relational norms and control as aligned with strategic
rather managerial involvement.
In the next section, the relations between relational norms and entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation are discussed. Then, the literature on relational
norms and VCs’ involvement is integrated and the research hypotheses are
presented. Finally the ﬁndings of this study are presented and discussed.

The VC–entrepreneur relationship

2.1. Relational norms and conﬁdence in cooperation
Previous studies have shown that economic activities are embedded within the
social context, in which interpersonal obligations reduce transaction costs and the
need for formal monitoring (Larson 1992; Uzzi 1997; Neergaard and Ulhøi 2006).
Accordingly, economic actors may establish relational norms that embody
perceptions, beliefs, and attributions of the other party’s goodwill, benevolence,
and integrity (Whitener et al. 1998) as well as ﬂexibility, information exchange, and
solidarity (Joshi and Arnold 1997). Usually, actors establish cognitive share and
trust relations with people whom they perceive to be similar to them (DiMaggio
1992; Nohria 1992; Das and Teng 1998; Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998), because they
set up expectations about behaviors and intentions (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer
2003). Thus, cognitive sharing may contribute to identiﬁcation with a particular
reference group (Tsai and Ghoshal 1998; Levin, Whitener, and Cross 2006).
Furthermore, the relationship between shared perspectives and trust tends to be
stronger in relationships that have been managed over time (Levin, Whitener, and
Cross 2006).
In contrast to contractual covenants that serve as formal mechanism to ensure
cooperation, relational norms construct normative and cognitive shares that
constitute a mutual obligation to cooperate and share resources to achieve common
goals based on similar perceptions. These expectations about another’s intentions
and behavior set up a basis for commitment and reciprocity relations (Gambetta
1988; McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer 2003; Welter and Smallbone 2006). Hence,
relational norms may increase the probability of relational continuity (Joshi and
Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000) and decrease the need for control over opportunistic
behavior (Macaulay 2000). It was suggested that relational norms are developed over
time as the result of obligatory and reciprocal behaviors between the parties (Ring
and Van de Ven 1994). However, both parties also have considerations for
noncooperative behavior (Bowden 1994; Cable and Shane 1997). In addition, they
may face conﬂicts that may undermine cooperation (Busenitz et al. 1997; Harrison,
Dibben, and Mason 1997; Yitshaki 2008; Zacharakis, Erikson, and George 2010).
VCs pay great attention to interpersonal chemistry and similarities with
entrepreneurs as a criterion for making new investments (Shepherd and Zacharakis
2001; Franke et al. 2006; Murnieks et al. 2011). Recent studies have shown that
venture capital investments rely on relational norms (Sapienza and Korsgaard 1996;
De Clercq and Sapienza 2001, 2006; Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001; Busenitz, Fiet,
and Moesel 2004; Weber and Göbel 2005). In addition, it has also been found that
VCs’ conﬁdence in their portfolio ﬁrms’ cooperation is based on the level of the

<-----Page 5----->46

R. Yitshaki

interpersonal relations and the degree to which the VCs assume mutual commitment
to these relationships (Neergaard and Ulhøi 2006).
The relations between VCs and entrepreneurs depend of both parties’ motivation
to cooperate (Timmons and Bygrave 1986; Sahlman 1990; Sapienza and Korsgaard
1996; Cable and Shane 1997). Thus, conﬁdence in relations is crucial due to the high
interdependence between parties (Cable and Shane 1997). Accordingly, high relational
norms may obtain relational continuity (Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000),
as it constitutes cognitive share and expectations for commitment to the relations
over time (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer 2003). It is therefore hypothesized that:

Hypothesis 1: Entrepreneurs’ perceived relational norms will be positively associated with
their conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation.

2.2. Relational norms and VCs’ involvement
Following the agency theory perspective, economic actors may face risks of moral
hazard and opportunistic behavior (Jensen and Meckling 1976; Gulati 1995).
Accordingly, the relationships between VCs and entrepreneurs are formally
established through contractual arrangements that include stipulations and
governance mechanisms to control opportunistic behavior (Amit, Glosten, and
Muller 1990; Ruhnka and Young 1991; Amit, Brander, and Christoph 1998).
Usually, VCs seek to secure a higher proportion of seats on the board to increase
their control over strategic decision-making (Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996;
Smith 2005; Williams, Duncan, and Ginter 2006), with the aim of ensuring that
entrepreneurs act according to their expectations (Floyd and Lane 2000). VCs use
the board as a mechanism for aligning managers’ and shareholders’ interests by
employing formal governance and by using their voting, board, and liquidation
rights (Kaplan and Strömberg 2003), as well as by means of monitoring management
decisions (Busenitz et al. 1997; Hillman, Cannella, and Paetzold 2000).
Previous studies have shown that these formal contractual stipulations are
contingent on the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures of venture performance. VCs
especially want full control if the venture performs poorly. According to Kaplan and
Strömberg (2003) ‘as performance improves, the entrepreneurs retain/obtain more
control rights. If the ﬁrm performs well, the VCs retain their cash ﬂow rights, but
relinquish most of their control and liquidation rights’ (282). This tendency is
supported by other studies’ ﬁndings that show that VCs decrease their formal
involvement when the venture performs as expected (Sapienza 1992; Sapienza and
Gupta 1994; Sapienza and Korsgaard 1996; Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996).
Previous studies have shown that VCs add value to their portfolio ﬁrms by
assisting in ﬁnancing, formulating business strategy, building managerial teams,
serving as sounding boards, managing crises, and developing networks (MacMillan,
Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Gorman and Sahlman 1989; Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and
Welbourne 1990; Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Morris, Watling, and
Schindehutte 2000). Based on the above-mentioned studies, it is suggested that VCs’
involvement can be seen as varying between strategic and managerial involvement.
From the entrepreneurs’ point of view, strategic involvement can be seen as a set
of actions that relates to VCs’ added value and therefore may increase entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation. A similar expectation was found among VCs
that preferred to focus on strategically oriented issues, such as developing business
plans, assisting with acquisitions, and facilitating strategic relationships with other

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 05:34 20 May 2015

47

companies (Kaplan and Strömberg 2001). Although managerial involvement in
expanding the managerial team may be considered as beneﬁcial to the entrepreneurial management team (Kaplan and Strömberg 2001), high involvement in monitoring
activities (ﬁnancial and operational), as well as managerial involvement, is less
expected by entrepreneurs, as it might interrupt the balance between control and
cooperation (Busenitz et al. 1997) as well as undermine their expectation for
autonomy.
It has been further suggested that VCs’ involvement is also inﬂuenced by their
interactions with the entrepreneurs (Sapienza and Korsgaard 1996; Sapienza,
Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; De Clercq and Sapienza 2006). However, while
relational norms contribute to a decision to collaborate because it set up mutual
expectations for cooperation and commitment (Franke et al. 2006), maintaining
relational norms is inﬂuenced by the VCs’ involvement. Therefore, when VCs’
involvement is focused primarily on strategic issues such as formulating and
evaluating marketing plans or formulating business strategy (MacMillan, Kulow,
and Khoylian 1988; Rosenstein et al. 1993), these actions will likely be perceived as
consistent with the entrepreneurs’ beliefs and expectations for mutual cooperation.
Moreover, strategic involvement may be considered by entrepreneurs as beneﬁcial
because VCs’ strategic involvement may have a positive eﬀect upon the ﬁrm’s
performance (Giﬀord 1997; Fried, Bruton, and Hisrich 1998; Yoshikawa, Phan, and
Linton 2004). Thus, high relational norms is suggested to be associated with low
levels of risk that derive from opportunistic behavior (Joshi and Arnold 1997) and
may contribute to the development of conﬁdence in cooperative relations (Sapienza
and Korsgaard 1996; Whitener et al. 1998; Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001; McEvily,
Perrone, and Zaheer 2003).
On the other hand, low relational norms may be negatively associated with VCs’
managerial involvement because such involvement may indicate that VCs increase
their control by limiting entrepreneurs’ managerial autonomy (Cardon et al. 2005). It
was found that entrepreneurs see managerial involvement negatively (Gomez-Mejia,
Balkin, and Welbourne 1990), as extensive managerial involvement such as dismissal
of the entrepreneur/CEO may indicate higher control action of VCs. In such cases,
entrepreneurs perceive extensive managerial involvement as being contrary to their
expectations. It is therefore hypothesized that:
Hypothesis 2a: Entrepreneurs’ perceived relational norms will be positively associated with
VCs’ strategic involvement.
Hypothesis 2b: Entrepreneurs’ perceived relational norms will be negatively associated
with VCs’ managerial involvement.

2.3.

VCs’ strategic involvement and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in cooperation

Previous studies have found that active monitoring by the VCs increases the return
on investment (ROI) probability and has a positive eﬀect upon the ﬁrm’s
performance, with this being ascribed to the parties’ common compensation
incentives (Giﬀord 1997; Fried, Bruton, and Hisrich 1998; Yoshikawa, Phan, and
Linton 2004). In addition, it has also been found that entrepreneurs appreciate
their VCs’ strategic support, as it is found to predict performance (initial public
oﬀering or merger/acquisition; Miller 2003). Although the VCs’ tendency to control
board decisions is implicit in the VC–E relationship, VCs’ strategic involvement can
be seen as a fundamental part of their ability to add value (MacMillan, Kulow, and

<-----Page 7----->48

R. Yitshaki

Khoylian 1988; Gorman and Sahlman 1989). In addition, VCs’ strategic involvement
can be viewed as consistent with entrepreneurs’ expectations of assistance, rather
than being seen as intervention, since strategic involvement does not inhibit their
managerial autonomy. This argument is aligned with previous studies’ suggestions
that high relational norms may be positively associated with relational continuity
(Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000). It is therefore hypothesized that:

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 05:34 20 May 2015

Hypothesis 3a: VCs’ strategic involvement will be positively associated with entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation.

2.4. VCs’ managerial involvement and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in cooperation
It was argued that portfolio ﬁrm’s board composition reﬂects the established
contractual covenants and provisions (Fiet et al. 1997; Smith 2005). Hence, VCs use
the board of directors as a formal control mechanism (Amani, Wallace, and Fayez
2002; Daily et al. 2002; Williams, Duncan, and Ginter 2006). Previous studies
indicate that VCs have a clear preference to reduce ‘the concentration of executive
power in the hands of owners and entrepreneurs as a condition for their
participation’ (Williams, Duncan, and Ginter 2006, 310). As such, they ‘frequently
have substantial power over other participants in the startup’ (Fried and Ganor
2006, 971). Board control enables the VC to enforce changes in its portfolio
management structure (Rosenstein et al. 1993; Gompers and Lerner 1996; Fiet et al.
1997). In such cases, VCs may consider dismissing entrepreneurs who they perceive
as underperforming (Bruton, Fried, and Hisrich 1997, 2000; Fiet et al. 1997). When
agency risks cannot be resolved by entrepreneur replacement, VCs may choose an
exit strategy and defect (Amit, Brander, and Christoph 1998; Parhankangas and
Landstrom 2004) or cease funding the venture (Sahlman 1990). Hence, VCs’
managerial involvement can also be seen as a demonstration of concern and an
escalation of commitment that serves them in protecting their initial decision to
invest in faltering ﬁrms (Birmingham 2006).
From the entrepreneurs’ point of view, involvement in internal management
issues can be seen negatively (Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and Welbourne 1990). It was
found that when new venture teams had industry experience and longer team tenure
they viewed business management advice and operational assistance oﬀered by
their VCs negatively (Barney et al. 1996). Accordingly it seems that managerial
involvement by VCs might lead to entrepreneurs having less motivation to cooperate
(Chua and Woodward 1993; Cable and Shane 1997), as entrepreneurs have less
ability to inﬂuence strategic decision-making (Williams, Duncan, and Ginter 2006)
and because some of the VCs’ actions may be considered by entrepreneurs to be
opportunistic, especially if the VCs take coercive actions and replace an entrepreneur
(Bruton, Fried, and Hisrich 1997, 2000; Fiet et al. 1997; Shepherd and Zacharakis
2001). In addition, extensive managerial involvement may also be associated with
conﬂicts between VCs and entrepreneurs, as VCs take actions that might be opposed
to entrepreneurs’ interests (Yitshaki 2008; Zacharakis, Erikson, and George 2010).
Thus, the managerial involvement of VCs may indicate higher need for control and
low relational norms that may inhibit relational continuity (Joshi and Arnold 1997;
Macaulay 2000). It is therefore hypothesized that:
Hypothesis 3b: VCs’ managerial involvement will be negatively associated with
entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation.

The mediating role of VCs’ involvement

Previous studies have shown that the nature and scope of VCs’ involvement depend
on the venture capital ﬁrms’ strategic orientation, as well as the context in which
VC–E relations take place (MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Gorman and
Sahlman 1989; Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and Welbourne 1990; Sapienza, Manigart, and
Vermeir 1996; Morris, Watling, and Schindehutte 2000). While relational norms
is important for VC–E relations management, entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in VCs’
cooperation takes into consideration the degree of VCs’ involvement. Thus, low
relational norms between VCs and entrepreneurs are expected to be associated with
VCs’ high formal control (Macaulay 2000), whereas high relational norms decrease
opportunistic behavior and the need of formal control and therefore are expected to
be associated with relational continuity (Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000).
Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the scope of the VCs’ involvement plays a
mediating role between entrepreneurs’ perceived relational norms and conﬁdence in
their VCs’ cooperation.
Hypothesis 4: VCs’ strategic involvement will mediate the positive relations between
entrepreneurs’ perceived relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’
cooperation.
Hypothesis 5: VCs’ managerial involvement will mediate the negative relations between
entrepreneurs’ perceived relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’
cooperation.

Figure 1 summarizes the conceptual model.

Methodology

3.1. Data collection
Data were collected from 120 Israeli entrepreneurs using a survey instrument
developed by Shepherd and Zacharakis (2001). In addition, data were also collected
regarding the scope of VCs’ involvement using a questionnaire developed by

<-----Page 9----->50

R. Yitshaki

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 05:34 20 May 2015

MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988). These surveys were used in their original
(English) format, as Israeli entrepreneurs regularly correspond in English.
The survey instrument was sent out in the winter of 2004 by email to
entrepreneurs who were selected from 500 VC-backed entrepreneurial ﬁrms taken
from the Israeli Venture Capital Research Center database. One hundred twenty
entrepreneurs completed the survey instrument, representing a response rate of 24%
that reﬂects the population in terms of age, size, and location.
Most of the entrepreneurs (82%) referred in their answers to the lead investor. In
addition, most of the entrepreneurs (92%) indicated that the entrepreneurial team
holds 50% or less of the equity shares, meaning that VCs had formal governance
over most of the ﬁrms examined. Most entrepreneurs (64%) indicated that they had
previous experience in the industry in which their venture operated.

3.2. Measures
3.2.1. Entrepreneurs perceived relational norms
This was measured by the survey instrument developed by Zacharakis (2002).
Entrepreneurs were asked to rank their shared beliefs and perceived similarities,
using a seven-point Likert scale (e.g., ‘the VC is similar to you in that (s)he has the
same belief structure’ and ‘the VC shares your beliefs about doing business’). This
measure contains six items (a ¼ .915) and is aligned with the other studies indications
for relational norms (Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000).
3.2.2.

Conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation

Entrepreneurs were asked to what extent VCs act according to mutual interest rather
than opportunistically, using a seven-point Likert scale (e.g., ‘the VC pressures you
to seek short-term proﬁts to the detriment of long-term proﬁtability’). This measure
contains two items, indicating that entrepreneurs perceive conﬁdence in VCs’
cooperation via two aspects that related to VCs’ commitment over time: the degree
to which VCs are willing to provide subsequent investments and the pressure from
VCs toward long-term proﬁtability. These items were averaged to produce a scale
score (a ¼ .726). This measure is aligned with previous indications of relational
continuity (Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000).
As presented in Table 1 exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been employed
to identify the constructs of relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in
VCs’ cooperation. The purpose of EFA was to identify the factor structure
(Stevens 1996; Stapleton 1997) as this survey instrument has not been used
extensively.
3.2.3.

VCs’ involvement

The scope of VCs’ involvement was measured by the questionnaire developed by
MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988). This questionnaire examined the scope
and level of VCs’ involvement in 20 activities. This questionnaire has been used in
related studies (see, for example, Morris, Watling, and Schindehutte 2000; Yitshaki
2008). Entrepreneurs were asked to indicate to what extent their VC is involved in
each activity, using a seven-point Likert scale. This survey instrument was originally

in identifying the nature and scope of VCs’ involvement, EFA using principal

VCs’ strategic involvement

Strategic involvement of VCs was found to be related to the degree to which
entrepreneurs perceive their added value as being strategic. In addition, entrepreneurs also assessed their VCs’ strategic involvement by the degree to which they were
involved in formulating and evaluating marketing plans, developing business
strategy, developing professional support groups, and developing social networks.
As shown in Table 2, this measure contains ﬁve items (a ¼ .870).

VCs’ managerial involvement

Entrepreneurs were asked to describe to what extent VCs are involved in hiring key
managers, management replacement, management crises and problems, as well as to
what extent VCs are involved in setting priorities and ﬁnancial monitoring. As
shown in Table 2, this measure contains ﬁve items (a ¼ .860).

Control variables

3.3.1.

Entrepreneurs’ contractual covenants

Based on measured developed by Zacharakis (2002), entrepreneurs were asked to
what extent the contractual arrangements include control over VCs cooperation,
using a seven-point Likert scale (e.g., ‘the venture capital contract protects you from
inappropriate actions of the VC’). This measure contains three items (a ¼ .744).
3.3.2.

Perceived performance

Previous studies have shown that VC–E relations are inﬂuenced by the context that
these relations take place (MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Gorman and
Sahlman 1989; Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and Welbourne 1990; Sapienza, Manigart, and
Vermeir 1996; Morris, Watling, and Schindehutte 2000). Therefore the mediation model
controlled for performance. Following the performance scale proposed by MacMillan,
Kulow, and Khoylian (1988), entrepreneurs were asked to assess their venture
performance with respect to market share, degree of competition and innovativeness,
and proﬁt and ROI using a ﬁve-point Likert scale, ranging between ‘far below average’
and ‘far above average.’ These items were averaged to produce a scale score (a ¼ .876).
3.3.3. Investment rounds
The number of investment rounds that an entrepreneur obtains may indicate his ability
to create relational norm and therefore attract venture capital investments (Murnieks
et al. 2011). Therefore, entrepreneurs were asked how many times they raised venture
capital (e.g., ‘total number of rounds for all companies you have founded’).

Findings

4.1. Descriptive analysis
Table 3 shows the correlations between model variables. As shown, relational norms
(as examined by shared beliefs and entrepreneurs’ perceived similarities) positively
correlate with VCs’ conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation (r ¼ .585 [p 5 .01]). In addition,
relational norms are found to be positively correlated with VCs’ strategic involvement
(r ¼ .609 [p 5 .01]) and negatively with VCs’ managerial involvement (r ¼ 7.381
[p 5 .01]). Furthermore, VCs’ strategic involvement positively correlates with
entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation (r ¼ .578 [p 5 .01]), whereas
VCs’ managerial involvement correlates negatively with entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence
(r ¼ 7.358 [p 5 .01]). The ﬁndings also show that entrepreneurs’ contractual covenants
and perceived performance are positively correlated with entrepreneurs conﬁdence in
their VCs’ cooperation; however, this correlation become non-signiﬁcant in the
regression analysis.

4.2. Testing the model
Table 4 shows the results of the mediation model. The mediation model follows the
condition set up by Baron and Kenny (1986) for mediation. In addition, following
Holmbeck (1997) ‘the nature of the mediated relationships is such that the
independent variable inﬂuences the mediator which, in turn, inﬂuences the outcome’
(600).
The ﬁndings indicate that relational norms are positively associated with
conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation (b ¼ .53***) thus supporting Hypothesis 1. In
addition, relational norms are positively associated with VCs’ strategic involvement
(b ¼ .58***), and negatively with VCs’ managerial involvement (b ¼ 7.30**) thus
supporting Hypotheses 2a and 2b.
VCs’ strategic involvement is positively associated with entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence
in VCs’ cooperation (b ¼ .49***), whereas VC’s managerial involvement is

<-----Page 13----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 05:34 20 May 2015

54

R. Yitshaki

negatively associated with entrepreneurs conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation
(b ¼ 7.22**) thus supporting Hypotheses 3a and 3b.
As expected (column 4) relational norms become non-signiﬁcant after considering VCs’ strategic and managerial involvement. Sobel test (Baron and Kenny 1986)
results show that VCs’ strategic involvement mediates the positive relations between
relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation (z ¼ 4.03,
p ¼ .000) thus supporting Hypothesis 4. On the other hand, VCs’ managerial
involvement mediates the negative relations between relational norms and
entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation (z ¼ 2.01, p ¼ .04) thus
supporting Hypothesis 5.
These ﬁndings are supported by the qualitative data. Entrepreneurs indicated
that VCs’ strategic involvement is seen as an indication of their commitment, as was
explained by one of the entrepreneurs:
‘. . . their [the VCs’] valuable contribution to the venture is a result of trust relations and
mainly of commitment. In our ﬁrm, VCs are involved as advisors and social, rather than
coercive, partners. Throughout, I have been able to maintain my autonomy and to
beneﬁt from the VCs’ added value.’

The ﬁndings are further supported by another entrepreneur who indicated that
VCs’ managerial involvement is seen as negatively associated with conﬁdence in
VCs’ cooperation:
‘I don’t want any governance – we are too mature for that; I’m looking for involvement.
Governance leads to suspicions and prevents practical management. From my point of
view, they [the VCs] should abandon the perception of governance and adopt an
attitude of mutual cooperation and real involvement, but not managerial involvement.
I’m looking for another type of involvement: of guidance, mentoring, networking and
professional assistance. I’m looking for the autonomy that is associated with mentoring
[as opposed to controlling]. Autonomy indicates that the VCs trust me. Trust is the
central premise in every relationship between VCs and entrepreneurs. If the VCs don’t
trust me, they should discontinue our relationship.’

5.

Discussion

The ﬁndings of this study indicate that relational norms are positively associated
with conﬁdence in VCs’ cooperation (Joshi and Arnold 1997; Macaulay 2000).
However, it was found that VCs’ strategic involvement mediates the positive
relationship between relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in VCs’
cooperation, whereas VCs’ managerial involvement mediates the negative
relationship between relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in VCs’
cooperation.
The ﬁndings of this study have several implications for understanding the
complexity of relational management between VCs and entrepreneurs. The ﬁndings
extend the current literature by highlighting entrepreneurs’ perceptions regarding
relational continuity over time. Although VCs’ attractiveness of investment
opportunities is inﬂuenced by cognitive similarity with entrepreneurs (Murnieks
et al. 2011) this interaction bias indicates that relational norms serve as ex ante
consideration for screening investments’ opportunities. However, VCs’ ex post
consideration for relational continuity is inﬂuenced by their need for control.
For entrepreneurs, conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation is related to the degree to
which their investors will be committed to the relationships over time by obtaining

<-----Page 14----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 05:34 20 May 2015

55

subsequent funds and by demonstrating a long-term positive attitude toward the
venture. As entrepreneurs usually have less diversiﬁed possibilities to raise funds than
VCs have to seek ventures (Cable and Shane 1997), they face an uncertainty regarding
the degree to which the venture capital ﬁrm is able to be committed to the venture over
time. The ﬁndings indicate that relational norms contribute to relational continuity
especially when VCs are strategically involved. However, when VCs are highly involved
in managerial issues (i.e., managerial replacement), it might stiﬂe the preservation of the
relational norms and may be seen as inconsistent with entrepreneurs’ expectations
although VCs’ managerial involvement might indicate commitment. This adds to the
ﬁndings of other studies (Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and Welbourne 1990; Chua and
Woodward 1993; Cable and Shane 1997) by showing that VCs’ managerial
involvement is negatively associated with relational norms and by demonstrating
that extensive managerial involvement mediates the negative relations between
relational norms and entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation.
The ﬁndings of this study also extend the current literature regarding the optimal
balance between relational norms and formal control. Following Shepherd and
Zacharakis (2001), ‘the entrepreneur and the VC need to balance the level of control
and trust building mechanisms so that the optimal level of conﬁdence in partner
cooperation can be achieved’ (129). However, relational norms depend on subjective
and voluntary relations that cannot be enforced by formal contracts. Therefore,
relational norms rely on the dynamic process of relational management that is based
on diﬀerent perceptions and expectations. The ﬁndings suggest that entrepreneurs
consider ‘the optimal balance’ between relational norms and control as aligned with
strategic rather managerial involvement.
Practically, the ﬁndings of this study call for VCs’ and entrepreneurs’ attention
to the implications of the mediating role of VCs’ involvement on entrepreneurs’
conﬁdence in cooperation. Actually, conﬁdence in cooperation may change
dynamically over time, due to subsequent investments and changes in board
composition, unexpected environmental changes, managerial replacement, and
interpersonal conﬂict. Therefore, entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in their VCs’ cooperation can be seen as contingent on certain circumstances. Consequently, it is suggested
that both will occasionally reconstruct relational norms in order to clarify perceptual
asymmetries and set up expectations for long-term cooperation. In addition, the
ﬁndings of this study also indicate that VCs’ managerial involvement is negatively
associated with conﬁdence in cooperation. However, higher managerial involvement
may sometimes indicate higher commitment of VCs to the venture’s survivability.
It is therefore suggested that VCs need to clarify their expectations and joint
interests, thereby increasing entrepreneurs’ conﬁdence in cooperation. A high degree
of cooperation during crises might contribute to entrepreneurs’ commitment to
changes in management in a way that might reduce their uncertainty and increase
their conﬁdence in cooperation.
6. Limitations and future research directions
The limitation of this study relates to its reliance only on the perceptions of
entrepreneurs. In order to understand VC–E relational management, further
research should reﬂect both entrepreneurs’ and VCs’ perceptions of conﬁdence in
cooperation. In addition, as perceptions of conﬁdence are subsequent to relational
norms and to the inherent asymmetries that may have an impact on VC–E

<-----Page 15----->56

relations, it is important to obtain more in-depth insights to understand the
diﬀerences in both parties’ perceptions in diﬀerent contexts. This can be examined
by using qualitative methods, due to the complexity that is associated with
quantitative examination of the dyadic relations between VCs and entrepreneurs
(Higashide and Birley 2002; Yitshaki 2008). Further studies should also consider
more contextual indicators such as time since VC investment, board composition,
and share percentage of each party.
