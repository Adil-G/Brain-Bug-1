Abstract
Decision-making is an important aspect of daily life. Moreover, dysfunctions of decision-making play a critical role in a number of
neuropsychiatric disorders. Several important research groups have contributed a diverse set of approaches to study decision-making and its
underlying neurobiology. Insights from these studies may provide important directions for future research in this area.

1. Introduction
Decision-making fundamentally refers to the process of
making choices or reaching conclusions. One can conceptualize decision-making in a wide variety of situations, which
range from the selection of a simple act, such as initiating a

finger movement, to the selection of a complex action, such
as which bonds to buy in the stock market. In this special
issue, a number of research groups provide intriguing insights
into the blossoming field of the neurobiology of decisionmaking, but also highlight some of the important unsolved
problems. The goal of this overview is to identify common
ground among these researchers, embed the current findings
into a more general framework addressing important aspects
of decision-making research, and identify issues that will
need to be addressed in future research.

<-----Page 1----->M.P. Paulus / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 2–10

Conceptually, decision-making can be divided both
temporally and functionally into partially distinct processes:
(1) the assessment and formation of preferences among
possible options; (2) the selection and execution of an action;
and (3) the experience or evaluation of an outcome. During
the first stage, individuals attribute value to the available
options and select one of them. During the second stage,
individuals initiate, perform, and complete an action according to the preferences established during the first stage. To
successfully complete this stage, a range of action-related
processes occurs, such as the sequencing of actions, the
inhibition of competing actions, and the appropriate timing of
actions. During stage three, individuals generate and process
a signal, which is related to the difference between expected
and experienced outcomes. This signal provides a means of
linking actions to outcomes, and is key to adjusting the values
during the first stage of the next decision-making. Finally,
decision-making is an iterative process, such that the current
stage of decision-making is influenced by the history of
preceding stages and directly influences the subsequent
stages of processing.

2. Dimensions of decision-making
There are at least five critical dimensions that can
have profound effects on how individuals make decisions.
First, decision-making is often associated with uncertainty, either explicitly described as the probability of an
outcome associated with an action, or implicit as past
experienced associations of an action with an outcome.
Trepel et al. [66] argue that one must carefully consider
the complex transformation of probabilities into decision
weights, which influence the degree to which one option
is preferred over another. Similarly, Shiv et al. [61] show
that these probabilities are not necessarily perceived in a
linear fashion. Second, each option in a decision-making
situation has a certain value, which is derived from the
possible reward or punishment associated with the outcome
of that option. Ursu shows that this value may fundamentally
be processed relative to the alternative option. Thus, the
reference point, which defines the most preferred option in a
decision-making situation, may not be constant as suggest by
traditional utility theories but may vary according to the
available alternatives [40]. Third, decision-making takes
place over time; in other words, past actions and outcomes
affect the future assessment of options available. Yarkoni et
al. [69] show that individuals may process options over
several different time scales. In many daily decision-making
situations, individuals do not know explicitly how likely it is
that a given option will have a desirable or undesirable
outcome, but instead have acquired positive or negative
values associated with options because of prior experiences
with the selected choice. Fourth, many decision-making
situations take place between individuals or between groups
of individuals. Thus, options are evaluated not only according

3

to the positive and negative values of the decision-maker, but
also in regards to the effects of the decision on other
individuals or groups. These possible consequences may
have profound effects on the value attributed to an option.
Haselhuhn and Mellers [25] show that one must carefully
consider the trade-offs between self-interest, the individual
component, and fairness, the group-specific component of
decision-making. Fifth, although traditional choice psychology has sought to discover generic decision-making rules and
laws, there is extensive behavioral evidence that decisionmaking is highly dependent on context—to the extent that
some investigators have questioned whether there is such a
thing as a generic decision-making situation. Several groups
[26,61,68] show that contextual characteristics of the task or
the task situation have profound influence on behavior or
neural substrate activation.
Attribute level refers to the specific quantitative or
qualitative degree of an option dimension such as the price
of an apartment or the degree of nightlife in a vacation resort
[27]. The attribute levels of the dimensions for each option in
a decision-making situation do not contribute linearly to the
degree of preference of one option over another. This
seemingly obvious statement can have profound consequences for the interpretation of the experimental results. For
example, as Huckfeldt elaborates, subjects show a quicker
selection of an option when there is a stronger association in
long-term memory, which increases the level of accessibility.
This theme is also briefly mentioned in Trepel’s article, which
attempts to identify the basic components of a decisionmaking situation (acts [options], states, and consequences).
Nevertheless, the characteristics of options or acts are based
on complex processes that tend to conglomerate attributes not
necessarily in a cognitively rational manner (as hypothesized
in system I, see below) but also in an associative affective
way (as conceptualized in what is referred to as system II).
The review by Trepel et al. [66] emphasizes an important
issue that has not been widely addressed in the literature on
the neurobiology of decision-making. Specifically, investigators typically manipulate reward or punishment probability or magnitude without explicitly taking into account
the long established behavioral biases in these situations.
For example, a 50% chance of winning $1 is not the same as
a 25% chance of winning $2 even though the expected value
of both options is the same. It has long been recognized that
human beings transform both probability and reward or
punishment magnitude in characteristic ways to evaluate
different options. It would be useful to take into account
these transformations when conducting future neuroimaging
studies with these types of paradigms. Moreover, these
investigators also emphasize that framing effects are likely
to have strong influences on the processing characteristics of
particular tasks, which will make it more difficult to
establish a neural substrate that could be called a bgeneric
decision-makingQ system.
Over 200 years ago, Bernoulli [5] recognized that people’s
evaluation of potential outcomes is based on a subjective

<-----Page 2----->4

M.P. Paulus / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 2–10

value and differs from the simple mathematical product of
probability and outcome magnitude. He proposed that the
psychological function underlying the evaluation of the
magnitude of an outcome is concave, that is, that the
difference between $200 and $400 is evaluated as larger
than the difference between $1200 and $1400. The concavity
of the value function in the gain domain is paralleled by a
convexity in the loss domain (i.e., losing $400 versus $200 is
more aversive than $1400 versus $1200). In addition to
subjective effects on the magnitude of the value function,
individuals also show subjective weighing of the probability
of an outcome. It has long been recognized that a change from
impossibility, for example, bthe earth is not going to get hit by
an asteroidQ, to possibility, for example, bthe earth may get hit
by an asteroidQ, or from possibility to certainty has a bigger
impact than a change from a somewhat probable to a more
probable outcome [15]. In practical terms, people tend to
value a reduction of a probability proportionally much less
than the complete elimination of a probability, for example,
individuals typically do not buy car insurance for half price
that would only cover them on odd days [63].
Context-specific effects in decision-making situations: it
is widely assumed that because of the limited processing
resources of the brain, complex sets of stimuli are systematically simplified or beditedQ, which helps to establish rules.
Editing includes principles of combination, that is, probabilities of equal outcomes are added; simplification, that is,
non-essential differences are neglected; cancellation, that is,
elements common to both gambles are cancelled; and
segregation, that is, complex gambles are separated into
risky and riskless components. In addition to these editing
processes, other context-specific decision-making effects
have been reported. Specifically, one of the most basic
finding in decision-making processes is the bconcreteness
principleQ [62]. If an individual is asked to decide on the
relative preference (on a scale from blike very muchQ to bdon’t
like at allQ) between different ski vacation packages that are
characterized by the bquality of the snowQ and the price of the
hotel, individuals tend to overweigh the quality of the snow
attribute. In contrast, if subjects are asked to estimate the
maximum price they would be willing to pay for the different
ski vacation packages, they tend to overweigh the price of the
hotel attribute. Tversky [67] argued long ago that people
compare available options on each attribute individually
rather than evaluating the option as a whole, which leads to
the emphasis on some attributes and the neglect of others. In
particular, when two options have attributes that are very
similar, such as two cars with equally powerful engines, then
these attributes are ignored when one arrives at a final
decision.
Background contrast refers to the observation that
previous experience profoundly influences which dimension to emphasize when determining the degree of
preference of a particular option. For example, people
are more likely to select a cheaper tire, that is, select
according to price rather than quality, when they were

previously asked to select between two tires which differed
little in price but a lot in their associated warranty [60]. In
contrast, individuals who had previously been exposed to
small differences in warranty and a large price difference
were more likely to select the tire with the longer warranty.
Ursu and Carter [68] show in their study that background
contrast may be a special case of a counterfactual thinking,
that is, the evaluation of the selected option within the
context of the alternatives.
The degree of preference for an option and the resulting
selection of an action in a decision-making situation
depend strongly on the specific constellation of attributes.
For example, in situations when competing attributes of
available options are btoo close to callQ, for example, two
apartments that cost $290 versus $350 a month and are
associated with a 25-min versus a 5-min commute,
individuals do not necessarily select the option that would
maximize the outcome (select the $290 apartment) but,
instead, often choose to search for alternatives with more
variable attributes (e.g., asked to see other options with
varying commuting times). Moreover, the introduction of a
competing alternative increases the delay to make a
decision, for example, people are less likely to buy a tshirt, even if it is on sale, when at the same time another tshirt is on sale, relative to the situation when only one tshirt is on sale [59]. Finally, adding an option with an
extreme value on one attribute can have two effects on
decision-making. It can increase the preference for an
option with a medium value of the same attribute
(compromise) or it can reduce the attractiveness of an
option, which has a less attractive attribute (polarization).
For example, introducing a high-quality/high-priced camera as a third option for two mid-quality/mid-priced
cameras increases the preference for the cameras with
the median price. However, introducing a low-quality/lowpriced item tends to increase the preference for a highquality/high-priced item.
Lastly, in reference to Kahneman’s distinction between
decision utility and experienced utility, Trepel et al. [66]
emphasize that what one expects to observe and its
corresponding emotional impact may differ significantly
from what one eventually when an outcome is presented
experiences and the subsequent emotional impact of that
outcome. This distinction is consistent with the notion that
decision-making occurs in different and possibly separable
stages (assessment, action selection, and outcome processing). Moreover, this observation also calls into question
whether decision-making in situations with hypothetical
outcomes is similar to decision-making when the individual experiences subsequently the effects of the selected
option. For example, one could ask a subject to choose
between two gambles with or without presenting an actual
outcome. Whereas the former can be formulated to
explicitly address effects of explicit reward or punishment
probability or magnitude on the assessment of preferences
for an option, the latter may be required to examine the

<-----Page 3----->M.P. Paulus / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 2–10

5

integration of preceding stages of decision-making on
subsequent decision-making situations. This calls for more
systematic research into comparing the role of neural
substrates when decisions are made without presenting an
outcome versus when individuals are asked to select from
a range of available options within the context of
experiencing explicit reward or punishment associated
with these options.
A sophisticated experimental approach to determine the
influence of control mechanisms versus inhibitory processes
is suggested by Yarkoni et al. [69]. In their formulation, selfcontrol is defined as the ability to use internal representations
of long-term future outcomes to bias and constrain their
decision-making behavior. These investigators also emphasize the fact that in many decision-making situations, values,
goals, and probabilities are bmoving targetsQ, that is, are not
constant over time but are in fact sensitively influenced by
the prior choices that the person has made. This approach
mirrors that of dynamic decision-making theories. Specifically, Busemeyer and Townsend [7,51] propose decision
field theory to capture the deliberation process that occurs
with conflicting values. The theory predicts the feeling of
pleasure we may have about an important decision when the
action is far away, and the later dread we feel when the action
is imminent, for example, accepting to give an important talk
at a scientific conference. Decision field theory also predicts
preference reversals as a function of time pressure, violations
of stochastic dominance, and the inverse relationship
between decision time and choice proportions. Yarkoni et
al. [69] show that neural substrates important for temporal
processing are engaged in sustained neural activity when
processing rewards that change over many trials versus those
that change over few. These authors also highlight that
decision-making takes place over several temporal domains
and that one needs to establish a paradigm to examine these
different phenomena simultaneously.

system, which is thought to be evolutionarily older, fast,
mostly automatic, and hence not very accessible to conscious
awareness and control, uses primarily similarity and associative processing [70]. The other system is based on
algorithms and rules, for example, the probability calculus,
Bayesian updating, formal logic, is slower, effortful, and
requires awareness and conscious control. For example,
uncertain and threatening cues associated with action options
can trigger affective responses (e.g., fear, dread, anxiety) and
have profound influences on the decision-making process.
Therefore, several investigators have proposed that decisionmaking in the presence of risk could be conceptualized as a
general feeling state [34] rather than defined by the properties of the decision-making situation. Some investigators
have even argued that people predominantly use an affect
heuristic when making a decision [20,45], that is, individuals
base their decision on an baffect poolQ, which contains all the
positive and negative tags consciously or unconsciously
associated with the action options. Several empirical findings
have been cited to support this view.
The role of emotions is highlighted in the article by Shiv
et al. [61]. These investigators utilized a simple investment
task to examine the role of losses versus gains in
individuals with substance use disorder. These subjects
were more likely to invest than healthy comparison subjects
even when faced the possibility of a loss. Moreover, it
appeared that these subjects respond differently to feedback. Whereas normal participants were more likely to
withdraw from selecting a risky option particularly after a
loss, substance use individuals showed high levels of risky
responses after a prior loss or gain. These investigators
emphasize the multifactorial nature of these differences,
which could be attributable to attenuated loss outcome
processing, decreased ability to view future negative
consequences, and inability to inhibit attractiveness of
immediate reward.

3. Emotion and decision-making

4. Physiological responses and decision-making

William James linked decision-making, the process of
deliberating until an action takes place, to emotion [28].
Emotions have significant effects on decision-making
processes both during the assessment and outcome stage
of decision-making. For example, positive affect during the
assessment stage can result in greater variety seeking [29],
overestimation of the likelihood of favorable and underestimation of the likelihood of unfavorable events [43],
increased deliberation times [33], and more complex
decision-making strategies [38]. In comparison, negative
affect during this stage can narrow the search for response
alternatives [18], speed response selection, and reduce the
use of different sources of information [36].
Some investigators have suggested that two fundamentally different systems underlie decision-making [17], which
work in parallel but may arrive at conflicting decisions. One

Emotions have been defined as evolved adaptive process
to improve survival, characterized by and perceived as
distinctive and automated physiological responses [28], with
the function to judge or appraise events in our environment
along immediate, non-reflective dimensions of pleasantness,
control, certainty, responsibility, effort [64] and to create a
state of readiness to act [22]. Thus, measuring physiological
responsivity during decision-making situations may be a
useful approach to examine the effects of emotions on
decision-making. A major contribution is that of Damasio
[13], who proposed the somatic marker theory. This theory
posits that every stimulus is associated with an affective
weight that is coded automatically and generates changes in
the autonomic nervous system (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure,
skin conductance). These autonomic changes constitute the
somatic markers, which inform brain systems of the affective

<-----Page 4----->6

M.P. Paulus / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 2–10

weight, particularly emotional intensity, of stimuli. A key
component of their theory is the interaction between body and
brain in computing advantageous versus disadvantageous
action selection. In particular, somatic markers may represent
primary (body generated) or secondary (brain generated)
signals that associated value and meaning to options in a
decision-making situation. Along similar lines of reasoning,
some investigators have proposed a brisk-as-feelingsQ
hypothesis, which highlights the role of affect experienced
at the moment of decision making [34], consistent with the
emerging view that the anterior cingulate and the anterior
insula may be critical for the integration of afferent
interoceptive information about impending external stimuli
and internal emotional states [10,11]. According to these and
other related models, brain-generated body-feeling states
may be critical determinants for the evaluation of different
options during decision-making situations and result in
establishing a value system based on these body-feeling
states. The study by Cohen et al. [9] points toward the critical
role of the anterior cingulate cortex in a network of structures
that are important for processing interoceptive stimuli.
At this stage, it is not clear whether the observed changes
in body state are primary or secondary. Specifically, is an
acceleration or deceleration of the heart, a primary event
aimed to alert brain areas to the significance of an impending
stimulus or action selection situation or does the brain initiate
body state changes to prepare the individual for these events?
Ultimately, these questions can only be resolved by sophisticated psychophysiological neuroimaging experiments.
Moreover, selective pharmacological manipulation of peripheral body states, for example, administration of beta-blockers
that do not cross the blood–brain barrier, may begin to
address the causal connections between the body and the
brain in a decision-making situation.
Intriguingly, Crone et al. [12] show in a set of experiments
that heart rate changes can be linked specifically to outcome
variability, a measure of risk in a decision-making situation.
Specifically, it appears that heart-rate changes are related to
the ability to make a decision, which is contextually
dependent, that is, varies according to what could have
happened. Therefore, peripheral body states may provide a
means of alerting to events that are important for adjusting
future performance.

5. Neural substrates underlying decision-making
The neural processes and computations that may underlie
the adjustment of the value system over time has been under
intense investigation and several theoretical models [16,23,
57,65] have been proposed to explain how response
selection takes place in a decision-making situation.
These neural systems theoretical models have in
common a connection between specific brain systems and
processes underlying the adjustment of the value system.
For example, in the Log-likelihood model [57] a Bayesian-

like process [48] is proposed to modify probabilities of
hypotheses according to perceived stimuli [23], which is
thought to occur in the parietal cortex [47,58]. In
comparison, the Prediction Error, or Temporal Difference
model [56,65] focuses on monoaminergic neurons in
general, which appear to broadcast prediction errors, that
is, the difference between the expected and observed
reward, as global teaching signals to different areas of the
brain [55], and dopamine neurons in particular, which
generate a short-latency, phasic reward signal [54]. The
temporal difference model originally provided a neurally
based conceptualization of stimulus–reward processing.
This model has also been used to account for changes in
the stimulus–reward relationships in decision-making situations [16]. Moreover, BOLD fMRI activation changes
were found to be consistent with predictions by the
temporal difference model in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex during acquisition of appetitive conditioned
stimuli [44] and in the striatum during the expectancy
violation of positive and negative stimuli [39].
Using neuroimaging studies or brain lesion patients and
decision-making paradigms, several investigators have
shown that structures important for the processing of
reward [32], punishment [3], positive and negative moods
[46], as well as self-relevant processing [53] are also active
in decision-making situations. Therefore, it is important to
consider at what stage and to what extend emotions play a
role during decision-making. If one divides decisionmaking into the three stages outlined in the introduction,
that is, assessing the situation and the weight of each
available option, selecting and completing an action
according to optimal option, and experience the consequences of the outcome, one can argue that emotions can
play different roles during different stages of decisionmaking. For example, anticipation or expectation of
outcomes associated with each available option may play
a critical role during the first stage of decision-making,
which is consistent with the findings by Ursu and Carter
[68]. It appears that individuals continuously form predictions about the future, which are updated with new
information (see, for recent example, Ref. [50]). If one
assumes that emotions are the consciously perceived
feelings [14], indicating change in impending reward or
punishment, one should not be surprised to find significant
emotional responses during the assessment stage of
decision-making. Similarly, during the action phase of the
decision-making process, particularly when temporally
extended, one could conceivably find that the degree of
effort associated with action selection can generate feelings
that are highly relevant for the completion of the selected
choice. Lastly, it is obvious that outcomes can provoke
strong emotions. It will be particularly interesting to
examine whether the outcomes experienced following a
decision-making situation show similar characteristics as
the experience of expected rewards or punishments. In
particular, it will be important to determine whether

<-----Page 5----->M.P. Paulus / Cognitive Brain Research 23 (2005) 2–10

populations with psychiatric disorders as studied by Shiv,
Fishbein and Goudriaan show stage-specific emotional
impairments.
One may propose that neural substrates, which are
observed to be active during decision-making, could play
three different roles. First, these neural substrates could
serve to employ generic cognitive and affective components during the decision-making process. For example,
Braver asserts the point that many of the activation
patterns observed during a temporally-extended decisionmaking task involve neural substrates that have commonly
been identified with cognitive functions comprising cognitive or executive control, error monitoring, and working
memory. Second, one may argue that certain neural
substrates are specifically involved in decision-making
relevant processes. For example, Trepel argues that
valuation, an important component in establishing expected
utility of a given option, could be linked to posterior
parietal cortex activation and not simply reflect different
degrees of attentional processing. Similarly, Cohen shows
differential activation during high-risk vs. low-risk decisions in right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, temporal and
parietal cortex, as well as anterior cingulate and ventral
striatum. Moreover, this author argues that the ACC
specifically processes decision to choose a highly uncertain
large reward. In this context, it is interesting to mention
that prospect theory specifically argues that the nonlinearity of the probability weighing is directly related to
a risk-averse/prone decision-making pattern. Future investigation will need to show whether there is a relationship
between the ACC and the degree of nonlinearity within the
context of prospect theory. Third, one may argue that
processes that are associated with but not necessarily
central to the decision-making operation activate neural
substrates. For example, Yarkoni shows that task-related
activation patterns were related to state-dependent changes
in task condition but argued that some of these neural
substrates may simply be due to perceptual processing and
specific task characteristic. Similarly, Trepel highlights the
importance of considering framing effects, which may be
due to contextually biased brain representations of the
options available to the decision-maker.
Can we link choice theories to brain activation patterns?
This is a difficult but important question to address
because it may enable us to make predictions within a
framework of an existing theory rather than gathering
isolated behavioral and neuroimaging findings without
identifying the mechanics that connects them. In their
contribution, Trepel et al. [66] review key findings from
traditional choice psychology and suggest that one may be
able to associate activation patterns in distinct neural
substrate to peculiar decision-making phenomena. For
example, is the anterior cingulate activation related to the
S-shaped probability weighing function, the nonlinear
value function, or the fourfold pattern of risk-seeking
and risk-aversion?

6. Individual differences and clinical populations
Traditional choice psychology has sought to identify
generic decision-making patterns, that is, behaviors that
deviate from a normative explanation in a systematic manner
and can be observed in almost all individuals [30,35]. In
comparison, less attention has been paid to individual
differences, that is, whether personality or temperamental
characteristics are associated with different choice behaviors.
In several of the current studies, investigators show significant individual differences in choice behaviors. For example,
Haselhuhn and Mellers show that although the majority of
individuals cooperated for strategic reasons, that is, the
weighing between expected pleasure and the likelihood of
rejection, others appear to be driven by a tradeoff between
greed and fairness or by more pleasure from fair payoffs than
from large payoffs. These findings suggest that decisionmaking patterns are highly influenced by the manner in which
the individual process the conditions in which a decision has
to be made. These differences may be due to the degree to
which individuals project their own emotions onto others. In
this context, error monitoring may also be different for
individuals with different personality characteristics. For
example, Crone makes the point that highly anxious
individuals may have a hypersensitive performance monitoring system.
The recent emergence studying the neurobiology of
decision-making has also been closely associated with the
search for decision-making dysfunctions in populations with
neurological or psychiatric disorders [6,8,37,41,42,49]. In
this sense, decision-making research provides an ideal
translational opportunity to test emerging hypotheses in the
field of systems neuroscience or psychology in the clinical
sciences. However, at this stage, there is no clear framework
from which to develop bdysfunctionsQ of decision-making.
For example, we do not know whether specific decisionmaking related processes, for example, probability, value
processing, are dysfunctional in these populations or whether
the altered decision-making patterns are a consequence of
generic cognitive process dysfunctions. Initial studies by
Bechara et al. showed that ventromedial prefrontal lesion
patients were able to generate somatic markes but were not
able to utilize these markers in guiding them to make the
optimal decision [2].
Along similar lines of reasoning Bechara showed that
some, but not all, substance using individuals show
decision-making dysfunctions that are similar to those
observed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesion patients
[1,4]. Extending this line of research, Fishbein et al. [21]
show altered risky decision-making behavior in substance
using individuals. These authors show that drug using
subjects made more risky choices and were less likely to
shift strategies in response to learned contingencies.
Moreover, this behavior was associated with less activation
in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. An immediate goal
for clarifying the decision-making dysfunctions in sub-

<-----Page 6----->8

stance using individuals is whether they are more attracted
by the rewarding consequences, or whether they are less
deterred by the potential negative consequences, or
whether it is a combination of both. Elucidating this
mechanism has direct consequences for treatment. For
example, it is the former, one may have to focus on
providing competing stimuli that have similarly rewarding
outcomes but are associated with less negative consequences. Alternatively, if it is the latter, one may need to focus
on stressing the negative consequences in educational
interventions and measure its direct emotional impact on
individuals at risk.
The study of substance using subjects also highlights the
importance of further clarifying decision-making specific
versus generic cognitive dysfunctions contributing to
decision-making abnormalities. For example, these individuals perform poorly on tasks that are constructed to
measure inhibition such as go/nogo or stop tasks
[19,31,52]. Thus, failed inhibition of competing actions,
however, may also have a profound influence on appropriate decision-making.
Finally, the study by Fishbein et al. highlights the
importance of investigating various conceptualization of
risk. This study uses a modified Rogers’ task to which
individuals select a low-probability high reward versus a
high-probability low reward option. Nevertheless, this
task measures only certain aspects of risk but neglects
others. Slovic has shown that risk perception are not only
driven by the outcome and the probability of the event
but are also powerfully modulated by the perceived dread
[63], for example, the risk of a nuclear disaster is
perceived as more risky than that of a airplane accident
because of the aversive dread stimuli with nuclear
disaster. This is consistent with the system I and system
II type processing [17], which is briefly alluded to in the
review by Trepel et al. [66]. It will be important to
conceptualize risk processing and its dysfunction in
neuropsychiatric populations within the framework of
these types of processes (deliberate, slow, explicit, and
cognitive versus associative, fast, implicit, and affective).
Moreover, it is unclear how these different systems are
represented in the brain and whether selective dysfunctions in system II explain the risk-taking patterns
observed in drug-using individuals.
Apart from inhibitory dysfunction, self-regulatory abnormalities have also been proposed as a source of decisionmaking abnormalities in subjects with disorders of addiction.
Goudriaan et al. [24] interpret their findings to reveal that
pathological gamblers do not regulate their behavior
appropriately, that is, change as a result of negative
consequences. These authors argued that the difference
between pathological gamblers and healthy comparison
subjects may be due to the lack of behavioral flexibility or
the urge to regain previous losses. Therefore, an bappropriateQ
strategy may be employed with an binappropriate goalQ. One
may argue whether drug-using individual do not show

bdysfunctionalQ decision-making but instead show adaptive
decision-making within a dysfunctional framework of
assumptions and goals.

7. Conclusions
The papers in this issue show that decision-making is
complex, involves both cognitive and affective functions, and
plays an important role in individuals with neuropsychiatric
disorders. Moreover, some investigators raise the concern
that the subjective effects of reward and punishment
probability and magnitude are complex. Thus, experimental
parameters may need to take into account individually
derived weight and value functions. The field seems to be
ripe for a close collaboration between psychologists, social
scientists, systems and cognitive neuroscientists, as well as
clinical psychologists or neuroscientists and clinicians. The
development of a taxonomy of decision-making situations,
that is, the hierarchical classification of different types of
decision-making situations and their associated behavioral
phenomena, may also help to constrain what is a very broad
construct, which involves a number of different component
processes that are likely to rely on different brain systems.
Identifying or delineating such taxonomy may also help to
better determine what is dysfunctional in subjects who have
problems with decision-making.
