Behavior, Communication, and Assumptions About Other People's
Behavior in A Commons Dilemma Situation
Robyn M. Dawes, Jeanne McTavish, and Harriet Shaklee
University of Oregon and Oregon Research Institute
Two experiments investigated effects of communication on behavior in an eightperson commons dilemma of group versus individual gain. Subjects made a
single choice involving a substantial amount of money (possible outcomes ranging from nothing to $10 50). In Experiment 1, four communication conditions
(no communication, irrelevant communication, relevant communication, and relevant communication plus roll call) were crossed with the possibility of losing
money (loss, no loss). Subjects chose self-serving (defecting) or cooperating
responses and predicted responses of other group members. Results showed
defection significantly higher in the no-communication and irrelevant-communication conditions than in relevant-communication and relevant-communication
plus roll call conditions. Loss had no effect on decisions. Defectors expected
much more defection than did cooperators. Experiment 2 replicated irrelevant
communication and cooperation effects and compared predictions of participants
with those of observers. Variance of participants' predictions was significantly
greater than that of observers, indicating that participants' decisions were affecting their expectations about others' behavior.
When first discussing the prisoner's dilemma, Luce and Raiffa wrote (1957, p. 97)
that there ought to be a law against it. There
are laws against some prisoner's dilemmas,
but modern societies seem to be inventing
new ones at an alarming rate. It is, for example, to each individual's rational selfinterest to exploit the environment, pollute,
and (in some countries) overpopulate, while
the collective effect is worse for everyone
than if each individual exercised restraint.

Thus, individual behavior when faced with
such dilemmas is a matter of increasing
interest to both social scientists and people in
general.
Social dilemmas—such as that in the
Prisoner's Dilemma Game—are characterized
by two conditions (Dawes, 1975): (a) the
antisocial, or defecting, response is dominating for each individual; that is, no matter
what other people do, each individual is
best off behaving in an antisocial manner:

<-----Page 1----->R. DAWES, J McTAVISH, AND H SHAKLEE

(b) the result is an equilibrium that is
deficient. It is an equilibrium because no
player is motivated to change, and it is deficient because all individuals would prefer
an outcome in which all cooperated to one
in which all chose their dominant strategy
of defection. Within the context of these
conditions, it is possible to define a number
of different social dilemmas. It turns out,
however, that the most common experimental
games that have been devised for studying
behavior in a dilemma fituation are all
structurally identical, although often stated
differently by different authors. These games
are (a) N-person separable prisoner's dilemma (e.g., Hamburger, 1973), (b) games
in which payoffs for cooperation and defection are linear functions with equal slopes
of the number of cooperators (e.g., Kelley
& Grzelak, 1972), and (c) games devised according to the principle that profit for defection accrues directly to the defector while
loss (which is greater than gain) is spread
out equally among all the players 1 (Dawes,
1975). The purpose of the present research
is to examine behavior in such an experimental game—specifically, to look at the
roles of communication about the dilemma
and at the relationship between one's own
behavior and one's expectations about how
other people will behave.
Before proceeding to the empirical study,
let us first explain the game as characterized
by the gain-to-self-loss-spread-out principle.
The game is constructed on the basis of
Hardin's (1968) analysis of the "tragedy
of the commons." Each player can receive
a certain amount c for cooperating, but each

Experiment 1 was presented at the 197S West
Coast Conference on Small Group Research in
Victoria, British Columbia on April 16, 1975. The

player can in addition receive an amount d
if he or she chooses to defect. The group as
a whole is fined d + A, with A > 0, for each
defecting choice, each player's share of the
fine being (d + A)/iV where N is the number
of players. Thus, each player's motive for
defection is d—(d + \)/X which will be
greater than 0 provided that d > A/ (A7 — 1 ),
a side condition. Note that if there are m
cooperators, then the payoff for cooperation
is r - (N - m) (d + k)/N=
\(d + \)/N)
in + c — d — A; the payoff for defection is
the same amount incremented by d. Hence,
the payoffs for cooperation and defection are
linear functions with equal slopes of the
number of cooperators, and as Hamburger
(1973) has shown, such payoff functions
define games that are equivalent to Ar-person
separable prisoner's dilemmas.
Subjects in the experiments described in
this paper met in eight-person groups and
were faced with the following choices. A cooperative response earned $2.50 with no fine
to anyone A defecting response earned $12.00
with a fine of $1.50 to each group member
including the defector. Thus, each player had
an $8.00 motive to defect ([S12.00 - $1.50]
- $2.50). Of course, if all defect, no one
receives anything. If someone cooperates
and two or more other group members defect,
the cooperator has a negative payoff. This
investigation is the first of a series of experiments to identify situational and personal variables important to group or selfinterested decisions in this dilemma. Two
major variables were of interest here.
Opportunity for communication was the
first major variable and was manipulated
with the expectation that people faced with
this dilemma would have a better chance of
resolving it if they could communicate with
each other. Communication commonly results in increased cooperation in two-person
prisoner's dilemmas (e.g., Deutsch, 1960;
Loomis, 1959; Radlow & Weidner, 1966;
Swensson, 1967; Wichman, 1972) and had
a similar effect in a five-person social dilemma

1
Messick's (1973) union dilemma game also is
structurally identical, although in a probabilistic
context.

<-----Page 2----->BEHAVIOR, COMMUNICATION, AND ASSUMPTIONS

involving hypothetical business decisions
(Jerdee & Rosen, 1974). Caldwell (1976)
found that communication alone did not
seem to be sufficient to affect subjects' decisions; nevertheless, his findings were in
the right direction (although not significant)
and as he notes (p. 279), "Perhaps with
real money subjects would be less inclined
to treat the experiment as a competitive
game." (The same possibility applies to
most of the other research as well.)
Communication effects could have at least
three sources. First, the opportunity to communicate allows group members to get acquainted, which could raise their concern for
each others' welfare. Second, the relevant
information raised through the discussion
and appeals for mutual cooperation could
persuade group members to cooperate. Third,
group members' statements of their own intended decisions could assure other members
of their good intentions, leading to higher
rates of cooperation.
To distinguish between these possibilities,
four communication conditions were included
in the present design. The no-communication
(N) groups worked silently on an unrelated
topic before making their decision in the
game. The irrelevant-communication (I)
groups were allowed to get acquainted with
each other through a group discussion of
an unrelated topic, but were not permitted to
discuss the group dilemma decision. The
relevant-communication (C) groups discussed
the dilemma situation before making their
decisions, and the relevant-communication
plus vote (C + V) groups ended their discussion with a roll call in which each group
member made a nonbinding declaration of
intended decision. If a role call vote were
suggested in the C groups, it was stopped
by the experimenters. Thus, considering
groups ordered N, I, C, C + V, each of the
possible sources of communication effects
were systematically added to the conditions
of the previous group to see if it incremented
the level of cooperation in the group.
A second major variable of interest concerned possible individual differences in cooperators' and defectors' expectations about
others' decisions. Prior work by Kelley and

Stahelski (1970) on the prisoner's dilemma
indicated that cooperators and competitors
maintain different world views, with competitors expecting competition from other
players and cooperators expecting either cooperation or competition. Subjects in Experiment 1 were asked to predict other group
members' decisions to see if similar individual
differences occur in the commons dilemma.
Further research in Experiment 2 suggests
an alternative to Kelley and Stahelski's
interpretation of these differences in expectations.
A final variable manipulation was the possibility of losing money in the game. The
possibility for cooperators to lose money
might increase the risk associated with a
cooperative decision, leading to less cooperation. Alternatively, defectors might be more
reluctant to defect if their decision caused
other group members to lose money. The net
effect of these contrary forces was difficult to
predict. Equally difficult, however, was the
task of designing an experiment where loss
of money was possible without violating
experimental ethics.
The solution used in the experimental work
was to have subjects pool their winnings or
losses with friends, truncating pooled losses
at zero. Thus, an individual subject could
be put in a condition where he or she could
lose money. Subjects came to the experiment
in groups of four friends. Two of the four
went to a loss condition where they individually could lose money; two went to a
condition in which their potential personal
losses were truncated at zero. When the four
friends returned from their decision groups,
their earnings were pooled and shared
equally. If the net total was negative, money
was not taken from the group. Thus, subjects' losses could detract from their other
friends' gains, but subjects would never owe
the experimenter money by the end of the
experiment. In sum, communication (N, I,
C, C + V) and loss (loss, no loss) conditions were crossed in a 4 X 2 factorial
design.
Subjects' decisions and their expectations
about others' decisions were the two dependent variables of interest.

<-----Page 3----->R. DAWES, J. McTAVISH, AND H. SHAKLEE
were truncated at zero. Thus, the eight groups of
four friends separated and formed four groups of
eight strangers to play the commons dilemma game.

Decision-making Groups

Subjects were Tecruited from newspaper advertisements asking for groups of four friends
Eight such groups were scheduled for each time,
so that one member from each "friendship group"
could participate in separate "decision-making
groups" of eight strangers. Since scheduled groups
occasionally did not show up, a total of 284 subjects were run in 40 decision-making groups,
rather than the anticipated 320.

Payoff matrices were determined according to
the rule that each member of the decision group
would earn $2.50 for a cooperative choice (O) or
$12 00 for a defecting choice (X) All group members were fined $1 50 for each person in the group
who chose X.
When fewer than eight friendship groups showed
up for the experiment, the defectors' payoff was
reduced by an appropriate amount: to $10 50 for
seven-person groups, $9 00 for six-person groups,
etc.
Two payoff conditions were included in the
experiment. In the loss condition, payoff to a
cooperator was reduced by $1 50 for every defector
in the group; in the no-loss condition, cooperators'
negative payoffs were truncated at zero Table 1
indicates all possible outcomes to decision makers
under these two conditions.
Opportunity for communication was manipulated
in four communication conditions In the nocommunication condition, (Is) subjects were not
permitted to talk to each other Subjects in this
condition worked silently for 10 minutes on an
irrelevant task (estimating the percentage of people
at certain income levels in Eugene, Oregon, in the
United States, etc) before making their decisions
In the irrelevant-communication condition, (I) subjects discussed the same irrelevant topic for 10
minutes before making their decisions. In the
relevant-communication condition, (C) subjects
discussed the commons dilemma decision for 10
minutes before making their decisions They were
not, however, permitted to take a roll call In the
communication-plus-vote condition, (C + V) subjects' 10-minute discussion of the commons dilemma
decision ended in a roll call—a nonbinding declaration of intended decision.
The two loss conditions were crossed with the
four communication conditions in a 2 X 4 factorial
design Five groups were run in each condition.

Friendship Groups

Procedure

Friendship groups met initially with an experimenter who informed them that each person would
go to a different decision group where she or he
would make a decision with seven other people.
The four friends would then return to their friendship group, pool their earnings, and divide them
equally among themselves. If the total were negative,
no member of the friendship group would receive
anything (although people who did not win at
least $2.00 were contacted later and paid from $1 00
to $2.50 depending on their initial earnings). One
member from each friendship group was sent to
each of the foui communication conditions. Two
went to groups in which it was possible to lose
money, two to groups in which negative payoffs

Instructions were read to the decision groups as

task in which you will now be participating. To
insure that all of our subjects receive exactly the
same information, I will have to read the instructions. Please listen carefully. I can answer
questions at the end.
This table (Table 1) indicates the possible consequences of the decision each of you will he
asked to make. You must decide whether to
choose an X or an O. You will have to maTk an
X or an O on the card in private. If you choose
an O, you will earn $2.50 minus a $1.50 fine for
every person who chooses X. If you choose X,

you will earn $2.50 plus $9.50 minus $1 SO fine
for each person, including yourself, who chooses
X. (However, as you can see, your payoffs do
not go below zero.) By looking at the first row,
for example, you can see that if seven of you
choose O and one of you chooses X, then those
choosing O will earn $1.00 and the person choosing
X will earn $10 SO.
You will write your code number and decision
on the top of the sheet in your envelope. Your
decision will be totally private and none of the
other participants in this group will know what
you decided. You will each be paid and dismissed separately. On the sheet please indicate
what decision you believe each other person here
to be making. Beside the code number of each
person, mark X or O to indicate the choice you
believe that person to be making. Then indicate
your confidence level for each judgment with a
number from SO to 100, with 100 indicating
complete confidence. If you are just guessing, the
probability is SO-SO that you are correct, so
you should mark SO if you have no confidence at
all in your predictions Questions?
Once questions had been answered and group
members understood the decision, they proceeded to
10 minutes of discussion or interpolated task, depending on the communication condition When the
10 minutes were up, subjects made their decisions
and predictions of other group members' decisions
Once outcomes had been determined, subjects returned to their friendship groups where they divided any net gain between themselves.

Results
Because the groups differed in size, results
of defection and predicted defection are presented in percentages. Table 2 shows the
average proportion of defectors in each of
the eight conditions.
An analysis of variance based on arc sine
transformations of the proportions (where
the group is the unit of analysis) indicates
that the effect of communication is extremely
significant, F(3, 32) = 9.36, p <.001. The
loss manipulation was not only insignificant,
but accounted for virtually no variance as
did the Communication X Loss interaction.
As can be seen from Table 2, there is a great
deal more defection when subjects cannot
communicate about the dilemma, even if
Aey interact for 10 minutes about an irrelevant topic. Moreover, the structured communication with the vote did not elicit any
more cooperation than did the unstructured
communication (73% versus 72% on the
average), despite the fact that every subject

in the structured communication condition
announced an intention to cooperate.
The possible loss manipulation was not
only ineffective in eliciting differential cooperation, it was ineffective in eliciting differential predictions about others' behavior as
well. In the results about such prediction,
potential loss will therefore not be included
as a variable. What will be included is the
variable concerning whether the individual
making the prediction is a cooperator or a
defector.
The correlation between the proportion of
defections the subject predicted (not including himself or herself) and whether the subject actually defected was .60 (p < .001).
Table 3 presents the average proportion of
predicted defection on the part of other subjects made by defectors and cooperators in
the four different communication conditions
(collapsed across loss versus no loss). An
analysis of variance—again on these proportions transformed to arc sines, and again
with the group as the unit of analysis—
revealed two strong main effects, one for
communication condition and one for defectors versus cooperators.2 Overall, more
defection is predicted when people cannot
communicate, F(3, 31) = 9.86, p < .001, and
defectors predict almost four times as much
defection as do cooperators, F( 1,31) =35.93,
p < .001). When the subject's own behavior is
included in the prediction (i.e., the defector
predicts himself or herself to defect and the
cooperator to cooperate), the overall predic2
Some groups had to be omitted because they
consisted entirely of cooperators or defectors; hence

were virtually identical.

versus .13. The analysis of variance shows
virtually identical results; neither it nor the
proportions with the subjects included in
each condition are presented here. In the
results that follow, all predictions do not include the subjects themselves.
Table 4 presents the proportion of correct predictions made by defectors and cooperators in the four conditions. Again, the
analysis of variance was based on the arc
sine transformations of these proportions with
the group as the unit of analysis.
Subjects overall are more accurate at predicting in the communications conditions,
F(3, 31) = 11.30, p < .001, which is not
exactly surprising.
The overall accuracy of each subject as
measured by proportion correct is directly
affected by the match between the subject's
base-rate prediction of defection and the
actual base rate of defection. If, for example,
a subject predicted r percentage of defection
and p occurred, then even if the predictions
were noncontingent—that is, if the subject
could not accurately predict which subjects
would defect and which wouldn't—the expected proportion of correct predictions would
be rp + (1 - r) (1 - p). Each subject's actual proportion of correct predictions was
corrected for this base-rate accuracy, and
the residuals subjected to an analysis of condition by defection. These residual scores
are tiny, averaging .03, but significant, ^ ( 1 ,
248) = 8.69, p < .01.
The data were analyzed for sex differences.
Across conditions, there were no significant
sex differences in subjects' decisions, x 2 (l) =
1.78, p> .10.
Finally, the data were analyzed for differ-

ences in defection as a function of group
size. Due to no-shows, there were groups of
size 5 (n = 12), size 6 (« = 5), size 7 (n
= 10), and size 8 (w = 13); the overall proportion of defectors was .46, .30, .52, and
.54, respectively. The data were subjected to
a 4 X 2 analysis of variance with unequal
cells (Winer, 1962, p. 242) where the two
levels of the second factor were defined by
collapsing conditions N and I (which elicited
little cooperation) and C and C + V (which
elicited much). The effect of group size on
proportion of defection was nill, F(3, 32)
= 1.50, as was the interaction of group size
by condition, ^ ( 3 , 32) = 1.47.3
Discussion
It is not surprising that when people can
communicate, they can solve a dilemma
better than when they cannot. Simply getting
to know other people did not make much of
a difference, at least in the 10-minute discussion of the irrelevant-communication condition. Whether subjects in more contact or
longer lasting groups would be better able to
elicit implicit cooperation is an open question.
For reasons described later in this discussion, that question may remain unanswered.
At any rate, groups of strangers can in fact
elicit cooperative behavior from each other
if they are permitted to communicate about
the dilemma for 10 minutes. Even in these
groups, however, many people lied about
their intentions; although every vote was

A linear trend analysis using coefficients —3,
—1, + 1 , + 3 and the same error term used in the
Winer analysis revealed even less evidence for a
size effect. The F value was 1.44. (See Hays, 1973,
p. 587, for a description of such a trend analysis.)

unanimous in favor of cooperating, there was
only a single group in which all people actually cooperated. Nevertheless, the overall
rate of cooperation in communicating groups
was about 75%. (Interestingly enough, if
the rate in each group was 75%, each cooperator would end up with no money or
losing 50(#).
A much more striking finding concerns the
expectations about others' behavior. Defectors predict approximately four times as
much defection as do cooperators. The present study is purely correlational, so it is not
possible to determine the degree to which
perception of others' intentions influences
the decision to cooperate or defect and the
degree to which such a decision influences
judgment about other peoples' behavior.
Experiment 2 assesses the degree of such influence by comparing the judgments of people
who are actually making the decisions in such
groups with the judgments of observers.
The data concerning the prediction of defection indicate that people can accurately
predict overall defection and even the sources
of defection. But the prediction of the individual source—when corrected for base
rate—is pretty feeble.
One of the most significant aspects of this
study, however, did not show up in the data
analysis. It is the extreme seriousness with
which the subjects take the problems. Comments such as, "If you defect on the rest of
us, you're going to have to live with it the
rest of your life," were not at all uncommon.
Nor was it unusual for people to wish to
leave the experimental building by the back
door, to claim that they did not wish to see
the "sons of bitches" who doublecrossed
them, to become extremely angry at other

subjects, or to become tearful. For example,
one subject just assumed that everyone else
would cooperate in the no-communication
condition, and she ended up losing $8.00
which matched the amount of money her
friends had won. She was extremely upset,
wishing to see neither the other members
of the decision group, nor her friends. We
are concerned that her experience may have
had a very negative effect on her expectations about other people (although, alas,
making her more realistic).
The affect level was so high that we are
unwilling to run any intact groups because
of the effect the game might have on the
members' feelings about each other. The
affect level also mitigates against examining
choice visibility. In pretesting, we did run
one group in which choices were made public.
The three defectors were the target of a
great deal of hostility ("You have no idea
how much you alienate me 1 " one cooperator
shouted before storming out of the room);
they remained after the experiment until
all the cooperators were presumably long
gone. With the exception of the one cooperator who left hurriedly, the experimenters
calmed all cooperators who were upset. There
was, however, no general "debriefing" procedure because there was no deception in the
experiment.4
Experiment 2
The purposes of Experiment 2 were to
replicate the findings of Experiment 1 and
4

But subjects who received less than $2 00 lor
participation were contacted later and paid handsomely (up to $2.00) for filling out a brief questionnaire.

to explore further the source of the high correlation between subjects' own behavior and
their expectations about others. Kelley and
Stahelski (1970) attributed similar differences between cooperators and defectors in
a prisoner's dilemma to stable differences in
world view. According to them, competitive
people elicit competition from both cooperative and competitive people. Their consistent
experience is that people are competitive,
leading to a generalized expectancy that
others are like themselves. Cooperators' experience is differentiated according to the
behavior of others. Cooperative people meet
with cooperation from other cooperators and
competition from competitive people, resulting in a belief that others are heterogeneous with respect to the competitive dimension. According to this theory, then,
defectors come to the experiment with a pre-

disposition to expect others to behave similarly; cooperative people have no such consistent expectation.
Our interest was in the alternative possibility that the decision itself was affecting
subjects' expectations about others. A couple
of explanations were plausible. One source
may be motivational. Subjects may feel the
need to justify their decision—defectors in
order to assuage possible guilt over their
decision, cooperators to avoid feeling duped.
A second source is cognitive. Given the
belief that people tend to behave similarly
in the same situation, a subject who decides
to cooperate or to defect may have a rational
basis for believing others will do likewise.
Whichever the source, the subjects' decisions
themselves would lead them to believe that
others' decisions would be like theirs.
The expectation, then, is that predictions

<-----Page 8----->BEHAVIOR, COMMUNICATION, AND ASSUMPTIONS
of people who actually make the decision will
be different from those of people who observe
the same process but make no decision.
Participant cooperators should expect more
cooperation; participant defectors should expect defection, if the decision is affecting
participants' expectations. The observers who
make no decision should not be similarly
biased. Since participants' decisions would
distort cooperators' and defectors' predictions
in opposite directions, the variance of all
participants' predictions should be greater
than the variance of observers' predictions.
On the other hand, if Kelley and Stahelski
are correct, observers and participants should
have similar world views and should have
the same expectations about others' decisions.
Thus, the variance of predictions should be
roughly the same for participants and observers, since the proportion of potential
cooperators and defectors should be the same
in each group (given, of course, random assignment to the role of participant and observer).
Method
The number of conditions in Experiment 2 was
reduced to two. Because potential money loss had
no effect in Experiment 1, all losses were truncated
at zero. Further, because there was no difference
between the no-communication and irrelevantccmmunication conditions and between the communication and communication-plus-vote conditions, only an irrelevant-communication condition
and a relevant-communication condition were run—
with subjects in the relevant one being free to
have a roll call vote or not, depending upon the
group interaction. Further, there was no need to
use "friendship groups" because there was no
necessity of having potential monetary loss.

Procedure
Procedure for decision groups was identical to
that of the corresponding conditions in Experiment 1.
Instructions to observers were as follows:
You will be observing a decision-making task
in which the participants must individually decide between two choices: X and O. The outcome
of the individuals in the group depends on the
number of individuals choosing X and O. [Copies
of the matrix and prediction sheets are distributed.] This will also be explained to the participants and should be clear to you. Before the
participants make their decisions, you will have
an opportunity to observe a 10-minute discussion. Your task will be to predict what each
individual in the group will choose: either X or O.
In addition, we will ask you to indicate your
confidence level for each prediction with a number from 50 to 100, with 100 indicating complete
confidence If you are just guessing, the probability is 50-50 that you are correct, so you
should mark 50 if you have no confidence at all
in your predictions. Please make these predictions
and confidence ratings individually, without consulting one another. In addition, please refrain
from commenting about the group as you observe. I will now instruct the decision-making
group and will return shortly. Questions?
Observers were placed behind a one-way mirror
and made their predictions at the same time as the
participants made their predictions and decisions.
Results

The difference between irrelevant-communication and relevant-communication was
replicated. In the irrelevant-communication
condition, 76% of the subjects defected,
while in the relevant communication only
3 1 % did so. Since all groups contained eight
people, a one-way analysis of variance was
performed on the number of defectors in the

irrelevant-communication condition.5
All the other effects for participants replicated. As before, there is more predicted
defection in the irrelevant-communication
condition (.53 vs. .20; ^ ( 1 , 16) = 16.65,
p < .001), and defectors predict more defection than do cooperators (.56 vs. .18; ^ ( 1 ,
16) =37.86, p< .001).
Also, as before, there is a higher proportion
of correct predictions in the relevant-communication condition than in the irrelevantcommunication condition, but the result is
not significant, F(l, 16) = 1.72. The findings of positive residual accuracy, however,
was not replicated; in fact, the residual accuracy was negative, averaging —.02.
Figure 1 presents the number of defections
predicted by cooperators, defectors, and observers, broken down by conditions. In order
to make the predictions of participants and
observers comparable, each participant was
assumed to have made an (implicit) prediction for himself or herself; in addition, each
observer was randomly paired with a participant, and the prediction of the observer
for that participant was changed if it was
incorrect. Thus, the observers and participants were put in the same situation—guessing about seven of the choices and knowing
about one.6 The variance of predictions for
the participants was 7.50, whereas that for
the observers was 4.60; for testing the null
hypothesis of equal variance, ^(159, 148)
= 1.63, p < .01. In the irrelevant-communication condition, the variances are 5.24 for
participants and 3.20 for observers, F(79,
75) = 1.64, p < .05, while in the relevantcommunication condition the respective variances were 3.84 and 3.65, F(79, 72) = 1.05,

Discussion
The most important finding of this experiment was that having to make the cooperative
or defective choice apparently did affect the
estimates of what other people would do, as
well as vice versa. Thus, one's choices in
such a dilemma situation not only reflect beliefs about others, but also affect these beliefs. There are a number of possible explanations.

First, the effect may be pure rationalization. Having decided to cooperate or defect,
the group member may attempt to justify
the choice by his or her estimates of what
others will do. Clearly, a cooperative choice
is not very wise if any other people are
going to defect, while a defecting choice may
be considered downright immoral if most
other people cooperate. Thus, the group
member may have a motivational reason for
believing that other people will behave in a
similar manner; specifically, such a belief
helps the individual maintain an image of
being a rational, moral person.
Second, there may be two closely related
cognitive reasons for the behavior to affect
the belief. Individuals may decide to use
their own behavior as information about
what other people would do; after all, if
people from similar cultures tend to behave
in similar ways in similar situations, and if
I do this, it follows that my peers may do so
also. In addition, there is the possibility that
as I make up my mind to defect or cooperate,
the reasons leading to the choice I finally
make become more salient, while those leading to the other choice become less so. Then,
when attempting to evaluate what other
people will do, I see compelling reasons for

Subsequent research—not supported here supports
the findings of Experiment 1; we have never been
able to replicate the sex effect.

The rationale fox this procedure may best be
explained by example. Suppose that four of the eight
group members defect. A cooperator is facing
seven other group members, of whom four (57%)
defect; a defector is facing seven other group members, of whom three (43%) defect; an observer is
facing eight group members of whom four (50%)
defect. By including the participants' own choice
in the predictions, cooperators, defectors, and observers are all facing the same situation—«ight
group members of whom four defect. Such an inclusion, however, means that fox the participants,
one of the "predictions" (of their own behavior)
is not a guess but a certainty. To make the choices
of the observers strictly comparable to the participants, one of their predictions was turned into a
certainty by randomly pairing them with a group
member and changing the predictions of that group
member if it were wrong. Many other means of
achieving comparability were considered over a
4-month period, and all were rejected. The reasons
for such rejection would be too lengthy to detail here.

doing what I do and less compelling ones
for doing the opposite.
As suggested by our colleague, David
Messick (Note 1), one such reason may involve the ethical implication of the choice—
that when people perceive an ethical dimension or component in a particular social
choice, they may have a tendency to assume
that other people will have the same perception. (For example, the individual who
perceives a particular social choice in terms
of a fundamental religious struggle between
good and evil tends to believe that others
would view it along the same dimension and
that the atheist or agnostic who denies such
a perception is simply lying or deluding
himself.) Thus, the act of making a choice
considered ethical or rational may define the
situation for the chooser as one requiring
ethicality or rationality and hence bias the
chooser to believe that others will behave in
a similar ethical or rational manner.
