Abstract
This paper evaluates the role of regional cluster composition in the performance of regional industries. On
the one hand, diminishing returns to specialization in a location can result in a convergence effect: the
growth rate of an industry within a region may be declining in the level of activity of that industry. At the
same time, positive spillovers across complementary economic activities provide an impetus for
agglomeration: the growth rate of an industry within a region may be increasing in the size and “strength”
(i.e., relative presence) of related industries. Building on Porter (1998, 2003), we develop a systematic
empirical framework to analyze the role of regional clusters – groups of closely related and complementary
industries operating within a particular region – in the growth of regional industries. We exploit data from
the US Cluster Mapping Project to examine agglomeration within regional clusters after controlling for
convergence at the region-industry level. We find that industries located in a strong cluster register higher
employment and patenting growth. Industry growth also increases with the strength of related clusters in
the region, and with the strength of similar clusters in adjacent regions. We also find evidence of the
complementarity between employment and innovation performance in regional clusters. The initial
employment and patenting strength of a cluster each has a separate positive effect on the employment and
patenting growth of the constituent industries. Finally, we find that new regional industries emerge where
there is a strong initial cluster environment. These findings are consistent with multiple types of
externalities arising in clusters (knowledge, skills, input-output linkages, and others).
Keywords: industry clusters, dynamic economies of agglomeration, inter-regional spillovers.

Introduction
A striking feature of the US and other national economies is significant variation in

regional economic performance. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain why some
regions achieve significantly higher growth rates than others in the highly open US economy, with
particular emphasis on the role of initial conditions, the potential for innovation and knowledge
spillovers, and the composition of economic activity (among others, Porter, 1990; Glaeser et al.,
1992; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991; Venables, 1996; Henderson, 1997; Fujita, Krugman, and
Venables, 1999). Policymakers and researchers have focused considerable attention on regions
such as Silicon Valley which appear to have achieved strong economic performance through the
presence of innovative clusters of related companies and industries (Porter, 1990, 1998; Saxenian,
1994; Swann, 1998; Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004). The empirical literature examining the
impact of related economic activity on regional performance is small but growing, with most
studies focusing on particular dimensions of performance (Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Baptista
and Swann, 1998; Combes, 2000; Porter, 2003; Glaeser and Kerr 2009; Delgado, Porter and Stern,
2010; among others).
This paper focuses on the role of clusters - groups of closely related industries co-located
in a given region - in the employment and innovation growth of the individual industries that
constitute the clusters. Any empirical investigation of region-industry growth must account for
two economic forces: convergence and agglomeration. Convergence arises when the potential for
growth is declining in the level of economic activity as a result of diminishing returns (Barro and
Sala-i-Martin, 1992). While many studies focus on diminishing returns at the regional level,
convergence also arises at the region-industry level (Henderson et al., 1995; Dumais et al., 2002).
In this case, the region-industry growth rate will be declining in the initial level of economic
activity due to mean reversion or diseconomies of agglomeration (e.g., congestion costs that
increase the price of inputs).
Agglomeration exerts a countervailing force on regional performance. In the presence of
agglomeration economies, growth is increasing in the level of economic activity (Glaeser et al.,
1992). Agglomeration arises from interdependencies across complementary activities that give
rise to increasing returns. The literature has tended to contrast two potential types of agglomeration
forces: localization (increasing returns to activities within a single industry) and urbanization
(increasing returns to diversity at the overall regional level). The impact of these types of

2

<-----Page 2----->agglomerations is often obscured by the influence of convergence on growth. If both convergence
and agglomeration effects are present at the region-industry level, economic growth of a regional
industry will reflect a balancing of the two effects (Henderson et al., 1995).
This paper moves beyond this impasse by focusing on the role of clusters on regionindustry growth. While convergence may prevail at the region-industry level, it is possible to
examine agglomeration forces that operate across industries within a regional cluster. The
presence of complementary activity in a cluster may give rise to externalities that will facilitate the
growth of the region-industry.
Our focus on clusters provides four related contributions. First we are able to move beyond
the traditional dichotomy of agglomeration forces: localization of individual industries and
urbanization arising from the overall diversity of regional economic activity (see, e.g., Glaeser et
al., 1992; Henderson et al., 1995; Combes, 2000). Instead, building on Porter (1990, 1998, 2001),
we study agglomeration forces arising among closely related industries that constitute clusters. By
sharing common technologies, knowledge, inputs, outputs and cluster-specific institutions,
industries within a cluster may benefit from numerous complementarities.1

Our empirical

methodology examines agglomeration arising within the set of related industries that surround a
region-industry while accounting for convergence at the region-industry level. We expect that the
growth rate of a region-industry will increase in the “strength” (relative presence) of the regional
cluster within which that industry operates.
Second, we evaluate the role of clusters on the employment and innovation performance
of regional industries. Theoretical models offer equilibrium predictions for the relationship
between individual agglomeration economies and specific facets of economic performance
(Krugman, 1991; Duranton and Puga, 2004; Moretti 2004). Instead, we explore how cluster
strength affects region-industry growth in employment and innovation.

While these two

performance dimensions may respond differently to particular agglomeration economies (Bostic,
Gans and Stern, 1997; Cingano and Schivardi, 2004), we expect that clusters will matter for both.

1

Other relevant studies examine various interdependencies among manufacturing industries, notably input-output,
patenting, and occupational linkages (e.g., see Ellison and Glaeser, 1997; Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr, 2010). However,
they do not address the broader array of interdependencies associated with related industries in both service and
manufacturing. Frenken et al., (2007) move beyond urbanization economies by separating out the role of “related”
and “unrelated” economic diversity in regional growth. We discuss these measures of in the data section.

3

<-----Page 3----->Third, we study the complementarities between employment and innovation performance
in regions. An active debate has centered on whether co-location of production and innovation is
important for employment and innovation outcomes (Dertouzos et al. 1989; Helper et al. 2012;
Rivkin and Porter, 2012; Berger, 2013). Motivated by this debate we examine the duality between
employment and innovation within regional clusters. To do so, we assess the role of the initial
employment and innovation strength of a cluster in the employment (and innovation) growth of
the industries in the cluster. If innovation concentration matters for employment creation, the
initial innovation strength of the cluster will positively relate to the employment growth of the
industries in the cluster.
This analysis also provides evidence on the types of cluster agglomerations that are
associated with industry growth. For example, if the initial innovation strength in the regional
cluster is the dominant influence on employment growth, this would suggest that employment
growth is mainly driven by knowledge spillovers. Instead, if both the initial employment and
innovation strength of the cluster matter for employment growth, this would suggest that a broader
set of mechanisms are at work, including input-output linkages and access to demand as well as
knowledge spillovers.
Finally, we use the cluster framework to examine the diversification of regional economies.
Several studies suggest that the emergence of new industries in a region is affected by the preexisting industry composition of the region (Swann 1998; Porter 1998; Klepper 2007, 2010;
Neffke et al. 2011). Externalities of various sorts may arise within a regional cluster and in related
clusters that bear on the emergence of industries in the cluster. Our analysis sheds light on the
path of regional economic diversification and the evolution of clusters.
We investigate these ideas utilizing a novel panel dataset developed by the US Cluster
Mapping Project (CMP). This database, drawing on the County Business Patterns data, provides
a systematic classification system for mapping clusters within the US economy. Clusters are
defined as groups of industries related by multiple types of linkages (demand, supply, knowledge,
and others). The CMP identifies 41 clusters incorporating 589 “traded” industries. Traded
industries are those which concentrate in particular regions and sell products or services across
regions and countries, in contrast to local industries serving primarily the local market.2

See Porter (2003), and the discussion in Section 4.

4

<-----Page 4----->The database includes attributes of cluster composition and economic performance at the
region-cluster-industry level between 1990 and 2005, covering 177 mutually exclusive Economic
Areas (EAs) in the contiguous United States. We explore several measures of the cluster
environment surrounding each region-industry, including a measure based on the strength of the
cluster, a measure of the strength of related clusters within the region, and a measure that captures
the strength of similar clusters in neighboring regions. For example, motor vehicles and car bodies
(SIC 3711) is one of 15 industries in the automotive cluster. For this industry we look at its
presence in a region and the presence of the other industries in the automotive cluster in the region
(excluding SIC 3711). The automotive cluster can also be linked to as many as 6 related clusters
(such as metal manufacturing) that may be present in the region, and to automotive clusters in
geographically adjacent regions.
Our empirical strategy simultaneously accommodates convergence within an industry and
agglomeration within a cluster. A major identification challenge is to account for bias from
unobserved factors, such as the size of the region or policies associated with certain types of
regions, clusters or industries, that may be correlated with a region’s cluster composition and
subsequent performance. Our core models specify region-industry growth between 1990 and 2005
as a function of the initial size of the region-industry, the initial strength of the cluster environment
around that region-industry, and region and industry fixed effects. By accounting for the potential
for spurious correlation between cluster strength and the overall growth rate of a given region or
industry, we are able to examine the relationship between clusters and performance.
Our findings provide support for the distinct influences of convergence and cluster-based
agglomeration. We find that the rate of growth of employment of a region-industry is declining in
the initial level of employment at the region-industry, but increasing in the employment strength
of the cluster environment to which that industry belongs. Positive agglomeration economies arise
within a regional cluster, among related clusters, and across the same cluster in neighboring
regions. Not only do cluster agglomerations matter for the employment growth of high-tech
manufacturing industries, but also for service and low-tech manufacturing industries.
We find evidence on the duality between employment and innovation performance in
clusters. The initial employment and patenting strength of a regional cluster each have a separate
positive relationship with region-industry employment growth. These findings suggest that
multiple types of externalities are at work (knowledge, skills, and input-output linkages).

5

<-----Page 5----->The positive relationship between cluster strength and employment growth does not come
at the expense of innovation. We find that patenting growth in a region-industry is increasing in
the initial patenting and employment strength of the cluster to which that industry belongs.
Multiple types of externalities that arise in clusters appear to contribute to innovation creation.
Finally, we find that regional cluster strength is associated with the emergence of new
industries within the cluster. The strength of the cluster in neighboring regions also contributes to
the emergence of new industries in the regional cluster, suggesting that both intra- and interregional spillovers play a role in the evolution of regional clusters.
Prior empirical studies (such as Feldman and Audretsch (1999)) have usefully
demonstrated the impact of science-based related industries on region-industry innovation
performance, but our analysis suggests that the impact of complementarities across related
industries is far more pervasive. Rather than being confined to particular types of industries
(manufacturing or high-tech) or operating through particular channels (such as university-industry
linkages), our results suggest that a broader set of complementarities arising across related
industries contributes to the emergence and growth of regional industries. Our findings also
generalize and extend the conclusions of more qualitative studies of the role of clusters (Porter,
1990, 1998; Swann, 1992; Bresnahan and Gambardella, 2004; among others).
These findings suggest a number of policy implications. First, regional policies that
harness complementarities across related economic activity are likely to be more effective than
those that prioritize particular desirable industries or clusters where there is little pre-existing
strength within the region. Hence policy makers should pursue policies that leverage a region’s
cluster strengths (Porter, 1990, 1998, 2003; Cortright, 2006; Rodríguez-Clare, 2007; Ketels and
Memedovic, 2008). Cluster strength operationalizes the view that policy action should focus on
building upon pre-existing comparative advantage (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2003).3
Second, regional economic performance depends on the composition of economic activity
rather than the vagaries of political boundaries. The spillovers arising from related economic
activity typically span multiple jurisdictions (and even states). Policies aimed at attracting activity
from neighboring areas may be less effective than those which harness complementarities across

3

For example, Hausmann and Rodrik (2003) argue that policy action should focus on innovative projects that can
generate new knowledge about the relatedness among existing and potential new products. We think that these types
of information externalities may be facilitated in clusters of related industries.

6

<-----Page 6----->jurisdictions. The strength of neighboring clusters contributes to the growth and emergence of
regional industries, calling for policies that enhance knowledge, skills, input-output, and other
linkages across nearby regions.
Third, regional performance depends on the co-location of employment and innovation in
a region. There are positive complementarities between the employment and innovation activity
across industries within a regional cluster (and in neighboring clusters) that contribute to the
growth of existing industries as well as to the emergence of new regional industries. This call for
policies that foster complementarities between R&D, production, and support services within
clusters. For example, the creation of public or semi-public goods that are cluster-specific,
including institutions for collaboration, training programs, and policies to facilitate the
collaboration between producers and local R&D institutions (Porter and Emmons, 2003; Rivkin
and Porter, 2012; Berger, 2013).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin by describing the role of
clusters in the performance of regional industries. Section 3 presents the empirical framework.
Section 4 explains the data and the cluster definitions. Section 5 discusses the findings on the role
of the (employment-based) cluster environment in region-industry employment growth. Section
6 examines the duality between employment and innovation in clusters. Section 7 studies the role
of the cluster environment in the emergence of new regional industries. A final section concludes.

Clusters and Economic Geography
The agglomeration of related economic activity is a central feature of economic geography

(Marshall, 1920; Porter, 1990; Krugman, 1991; Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Ellison and Glaeser,
1997), but its prominence and role has been a puzzle. In a given location, limitations on resources
can result in diminishing returns. This can lead to convergence in economic activity (employment,
productivity) across regions over time (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Higgins et al., 2006).
However, the striking geographic concentration of related economic activity, with copious
examples ranging from textiles in northern Italy to financial services in New York City, reveals
the powerful role of agglomeration. Starting with Marshall (1920), economists have highlighted
three distinct drivers of agglomeration: input-output linkages, labor market pooling, and
knowledge spillovers. Though conceptually distinct, each of these mechanisms is associated with
cost or productivity advantages to firms that result in increasing returns to geographically

7

<-----Page 7----->proximate economic activity. Over time, an extensive literature has incorporated additional
agglomeration drivers, including local demand, specialized institutions and the structure of
regional business and social networks (Porter 1990, 1998; Saxenian 1994; Markusen 1996).
As suggested by Glaeser et al. (1992), the relationship between the initial structure of
economic activity within a region and region-industry economic growth is subtle. Differing scopes
of agglomeration forces may be at work. Agglomeration may arise from the specialization of a
region in a particular industry (so called localization economies) or from exploiting the overall
diversity of industries in an entire regional economy (so called urbanization economies).4
Empirical identification of these agglomeration effects has been hampered because of the
role of convergence on regional growth patterns. Consider the relationship between the growth of
economic activity and the initial level of economic activity within a region-industry. At the
industry level of analysis, both convergence and agglomeration effects may be present. Regionindustries may be subject to convergence effects (i.e., the coefficient on the initial level of
economic activity is negative), either as the result of mean-reversion or diminishing returns.5 For
example, the returns to economic activity can be diminishing in the level due to cost-based
competition and congestion costs. A large presence of firms in an industry relative to the size of
the region can intensify local competition for inputs, dampening incentives for entry and business
expansion. For example, if the price of specialized (labor or capital) inputs is increasing in the
number of local firms, there could be diminishing returns as a result of congestion costs (Sorenson
and Audia, 2000; Swann, 1998; LaFountain 2005; Duranton, 2007).6
However, region-industries may also be subject to agglomeration effects. There may be
externalities across firms within individual industries in learning, innovation, and spawning
entrepreneurs (Audretsch, 1998; Henderson, 2003; Gompers et al., 2005; Glaeser and Kerr, 2009;
Delgado, Porter and Stern, 2010).

The empirical relationship between regional industry

specialization and the growth of employment in that industry will be ambiguous, and will depend

4

The empirical findings of the papers testing for localization and urbanization economies are mixed. See the reviews
of Rosenthal and Strange (2004) and Beaudry and Schiffauerova (2009).
5
We draw on the convergence concept used by the cross-sectional growth literature to study economic activity across
countries, regions and regional industries (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991; Henderson et al., 1995; Higgins et al, 2006).
We focus on (conditional) convergence to a steady state, meaning that growth is declining in the level of economic
activity conditioning on differences across economies in their underlying fundamentals.
6
A number of prior studies find that convergence effects at the region-industry level may be sufficiently large to
compensate the localization economies (Henderson et al., 1995; Dumais et al., 2002; Findeisen and Südekum, 2008).

8

<-----Page 8----->on the precise nature of competition (cost-based or innovation-based) and the pattern of strategic
interaction among firms.
While convergence may prevail at the region-industry level, it is possible to examine the
potential for agglomeration by considering the role of the regional cluster environment that
surrounds the particular region-industry (i.e., the presence of other related industries co-located in
the region). The presence of related economic activity – e.g., specialized suppliers, a large or
advanced local customer base, producers of complementary products and services, specialized
institutions – may increase the pool of available inputs in a location and give rise to externalities
of various sorts. This, in turn, enhances the resources available for firm growth (see e.g., Porter,
1990, 1998, 2003; Swann, 1998; Audretsch, 1998; Baptista and Swann, 1999).
After controlling for the convergence effects at the region-industry level, an industry
participating in a cluster with a larger (relative) employment size should grow faster than the same
industry in a region with limited presence of the cluster. A strong regional cluster (and related
clusters) will enable greater agglomeration economies, including larger pools of skilled employees,
knowledge spillovers, specialized suppliers, and sophisticated buyers.

Proximity of related

economic activity can also reduce transaction costs and induce the growth of specialized local
institutions such as educational programs and trade groups that reinforce the complementarities
across related industries. Thus, a strong regional cluster should enhance the employment growth
of the industries in the cluster through increasing efficiency, productivity, and/or returns to
investment and innovation (see, e.g., Porter, 2003; Saxenian, 1994; Bresnahan and Gambardella,
2004; Bönte, 2004; Frenken et al. 2007; Delgado et al., 2010).7
However, there could be congestion costs taking place at the cluster-level as well. Larger
regional clusters can generate congestion costs in related inputs markets (Ciccone and Hall, 1996;
Swann, 1998; Sorenson and Audia, 2000). For example this could occur if the industries in the
cluster share inputs and the costs of inputs are increasing with the relative size of the cluster. We
expect that on average, after controlling for convergence forces at the region-industry level,

7

The increase in employment in clusters could be partially attributed to the creation of new businesses. The multiple
types of externalities that arise within clusters may facilitate entrepreneurship (Glaeser and Kerr, 2009; Feser et al.,
2008; Wennberg and Lindqvist, 2008; Delgado, Porter, and Stern, 2010). However, the net effect of business creation
on employment growth within a regional cluster will depend on the rate of firm churn and the type of entrepreneurship
(Rosenthal and Strange, 2009; Haltiwanger et al., 2009, Baptista and Preto, 2010).

9

<-----Page 9----->agglomeration forces will prevail over congestion costs at the cluster level. We recognize though
that these benefits may vary by region, cluster, or industry attributes.
In the empirical work, we also consider inter-regional spillovers, and examine the
relationship between region-industry growth and the presence of the cluster in neighboring regions.
Economic geography theory suggests that neighboring regions can play an important role in
shaping opportunities for growth (Fujita, Krugman and Venables, 1999; Fujita and Thisse, 2002).
Clusters co-located in nearby regions may benefit from inter-regional spillovers, which lower the
costs of entrepreneurship and business expansion (e.g., by providing access to customers, by
allowing firms to leverage proximate inputs, institutions, etc.). However, a strong cluster in a
neighboring region can be a source of competition for constrained inputs and demand. The cluster
strength in neighboring regions will have an ambiguous effect on the growth of regional industries,
depending on the relative salience of inter-regional spillovers versus locational competition.
As discussed earlier, we expect that the employment strength of a cluster will facilitate the
employment growth of the industries in the cluster. A related question is whether the innovation
strength of the cluster contributes to employment growth. This analysis relates to the debate on
whether the integration of R&D and employment (production) is important for regional
performance (Dertouzos et al. 1989; Rivkin and Porter, 2012; Berger, 2013). While innovation
and production are each geographically concentrated (Audrestch and Feldman, 1996; Alcacer,
2006; Helper et al. 2012), the complementarities between these two activities are poorly
understood.8
This literature motivates an empirical question concerning the complementarities between
employment and innovation performance in clusters. If the strength of innovation within a cluster
exerts knowledge spillovers that facilitate employment creation within the cluster, then the growth
of employment in a region-industry will be increasing in the pre-existing innovation strength of
the regional cluster within which it operates. Examining this requires conditioning on the preexisting employment strength of the regional cluster.
This analysis provides evidence regarding the types of mechanisms that are associated with
employment growth in clusters. For example, if the innovation strength of the regional cluster

8

Theory predicts benefits from co-locating innovation and production in industries where the manufacturing process
is not standardized (Vernon, 1996; Duranton and Puga, 2001). Some industry studies find results consistent with this
theory (see e.g., Pisano, 1997; Fuchs and Kirchain, 2010).

10

<-----Page 10----->solely matters for employment growth, knowledge spillovers would be the key driver of growth.
If both the employment and innovation strength of the regional cluster matter for employment
growth, this suggests that a broader set of mechanisms, such as knowledge spillovers, access to
specialized inputs and sophisticated demand, are at work.
While our analysis focuses on region-industry employment growth, we also examine
region-industry innovation growth to better understand the interplay between these two
performance dimensions. The innovation strength of a regional cluster may facilitate opportunities
for innovation if knowledge externalities arise among related industries (see e.g., Audretsch, 1998;
Baptista and Swann, 1998; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Aharonson, Baum, and Plunket, 2008;
Delgado, 2010). The employment strength of the cluster may also facilitate opportunities for
innovation (e.g., as the result of input-output linkages or through the presence of innovationseeking local demand).

In the empirical analysis we examine if, after controlling for the

convergence effect at the region-industry level, the growth of innovation in a region-industry
increases with the pre-existing innovation and/or employment strength of the regional cluster. If
both the initial employment and innovation strength of the cluster matter for innovation growth,
this suggests that an array of externalities beyond knowledge spillovers are at work in clusters.
Our final analysis concerns the role of clusters in the diversification of regional economies.
Prior studies suggest that the emergence of new industries in a region is affected by the pre-existing
industry composition of the region (Swann 1992, 1998; Porter 1998; Klepper 2007, 2010; Neffke,
Henning, and Boschma, 2011; Frenken, Cefis and Stam, 2011). In a recent study, Neffke,
Henning, and Boschma (2011) examine the evolution of Swedish regions, and find that
manufacturing industries that were technologically related to the pre-existing industries in a region
had a higher probability of entering that region. Industry studies also suggest that the emergence
of industries is affected by the presence of related activities in a region. Studies of the automotive
industry in Detroit and the tyre industry in Akron show that spinoffs from existing firms play an
important role in the emergence of these industries, and these spinoffs tend to be diversifiers that
leverage related industry experiences in the new industries (Klepper, 2007, 2010; Buenstorf and
Klepper, 2009). Building on these studies, we examine the role of a strong initial cluster
environment in the sub-sequent emergence of related industries in the cluster.

Model
To examine region-industry employment growth we draw on studies of conditional

convergence (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Combes, 2000a) that specify economic growth
as a function of the level of economic activity and observable attributes of the region. While
convergence forces may prevail at the region-industry level, we argue that agglomeration forces
may arise in clusters of related industries (Porter, 1998; Swann, 1998; Feldman and Audretsch,
1999; among others).
To test these ideas we examine region-industry growth between 1990 and 2005 for 177
regions and up to 589 traded industries, totaling 55083 region-industries with positive employment
in 1990. To study the potential for cluster agglomerations in regional industry growth, we
distinguish between the level of regional specialization in a particular industry and the strength of
the cluster environment around that region-industry, and control for the average growth of the
industry and the region. Our core econometric specification for region-industry employment
growth is:
 Employment icr,2005 

   0   ln(Industry Spec Employ, icr,1990 )
 Employment

(1)

 3 ln(Cluster Spec in Neighbors Employ, cr,1990 ) + i   r   icr .

The dependent variable is employment growth of the (4-digit SIC) industry i in cluster c in
region (Economic Area (EA)) r over the period 1990-2005. The explanatory variables are
specified at the initial date, 1990, which allows for the long-term effect of agglomeration
economies on regional performance (Henderson, 1997).

We compare the growth rates of

individual EA-industries, accounting for fixed differences in the overall growth of the EA and the
industry. The source of identification in equation 1 is the cross-sectional variation in industry and
cluster composition across regions rather than exogenous changes in the cluster environment over
time.
To capture the combined effect of the convergence and agglomeration forces at the regionindustry level, we specify an EA-industry growth model that includes (log of) regional
specialization in the industry (Industry Spec). This variable is an employment-based location
quotient that captures to what extent industry employment is over-represented in the region (see
Section 4 for a precise definition). In our model with industry and EA fixed effects, the variation

12

<-----Page 12----->in this variable is driven exclusively by variation in employment across EA-industries (i.e., the
estimated coefficient for (log of) Industry Specicr would be the same than for (log of)
Employmenticr).9
To capture the cluster-driven agglomeration forces, we include several measures of the
employment-based strength (i.e., relative presence) of the cluster environment surrounding that
region-industry (see Section 4 for a precise definition of these measures): Cluster SpecEmploy (a
measure of cluster strength in the set of other closely related industries constituting the cluster),
Related Clusters SpecEmploy (a measure of the strength of related clusters in the region), and Cluster
Spec in NeighborsEmploy (a measure of cluster strength in adjacent geographic regions).
To illustrate the unit of observation and explanatory variables, consider the pharmaceutical
preparations industry (SIC-2834) in the biopharmaceutical cluster in the Raleigh-Durham-Cary
(NC) region. For this region-industry we look at the specialization of the region in the industry;
the specialization of the region in related industries in biopharmaceuticals (excluding industry SIC2834); the presence in the region of other related clusters (e.g., medical devices); and the adjacent
regions’ specialization in biopharmaceuticals.
We include industry (αi) and region fixed effects (αr) to control for other differences across
regions and industries that affect region-industry growth.

Our analysis accounts for unobserved

factors (such as the size of the industry, the size of the region (urbanization economies), resource
endowments, etc.) that might be correlated both with our explanatory variables and region-industry
employment growth.
Our prediction concerning the coefficient on the initial (relative) size of an industry in the
region (Industry Spec) is ambiguous, depending on the relative salience of convergence and
agglomeration forces at the region-industry level. After controlling for convergence at the regionindustry level, we expect industries co-located with industries in the same cluster, or in regions
with strong related clusters, to perform better than industries in regions lacking cluster strength
(β1> 0 and β2 > 0), unless congestion costs prevail at the cluster level.

9

We are not trying to separate the convergence effect from agglomerations that occur at the region-industry level, but
to estimate the combined effect. Some studies have unsuccessfully tried to disentangle both effects by including in
their models the employment level of the regional industry as well as the specialization of the region in the industry
(e.g., Glaeser et al. 1992 and Henderson et al. 1995). However, including both variables in the specification induces
interpretation and identification problems (see discussion at Combes, 2000b).

13

<-----Page 13----->Importantly, we test whether this relationship is driven by industry complementarities
within clusters or simply results from random aggregation of industries. We implement a Monte
Carlo falsification test in which, for each iteration, we construct “random” clusters by randomly
assigning the 589 traded industries into 41 clusters (see Section 5 for a detailed description of our
procedure). By constructing “random” clusters, we are able to evaluate whether our results are
simply an artifact arising from the inclusion of any sets of industries or whether they depend on
clusters constructed based on complementarities.
To account for correlation of the error terms across industries within a regional cluster, the
standard errors are clustered by region-cluster. Finally, since nearby regions tend to specialize in
like clusters, there might be unobserved spatial autocorrelation (Anselin, 1988). We account for
this in two ways, by including in our specifications the strength of similar clusters in neighboring
regions, and by directly testing for spatial correlation using spatial econometric techniques.10
Parallel to the region-industry employment growth model specified in equation (1), we
specify the following model to estimate the growth in patenting (a measure of innovation):
 Patenting icr,2005 

   0   ln(Industry SpecPatents, icr,1990 )

The dependent variable is the growth in new patents granted in industry i in region (EA) r over the
period 1990-2005. The explanatory variables are based on the patents granted in 1990 in the
region-industry and in the cluster environment (See Table 1).

Data and Cluster Definitions
Data from the County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset is coded with cluster definitions

drawn from the US Cluster Mapping Project (CMP; see Porter, 2003). Before turning to the precise
variable definitions, it is useful to provide an overview of the data sources and the cluster
definitions. The CBP dataset is a publicly available database that provides annual county-level

10

Following Anselin (1988) and the extensions developed by LeSage (1999, p. 171), we test for spatial autocorrelation
using a first-order spatial autoregressive (FAR) model. We estimate our OLS specification (e.g., equation 1) and then
estimate the FAR model: ˆicr   Wˆicr  icr , where ˆ are the residuals from the OLS estimation, and W is an NxN
matrix (where N is the total number of region-industries) with elements equal to 1 for adjacent regions and 0 otherwise.
Under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation if ρ=0.

<-----Page 14----->measures of private sector non-agricultural employment at the level of four-digit SIC codes (which
we refer to as industries).11 The data is aggregated to the region-industry level and the regioncluster level, using four-digit SIC codes as the primary industry unit,12 and economic areas (EAs
as defined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis) as the main geographic unit.13 The analysis
focuses on the 1990-2005 period.
In addition to employment growth in a given EA-industry, we also examine the growth in
patenting. The EA-industry patent data is drawn from the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). This dataset includes detailed information about all USPTO utility patents,
including inventor location and technology classification. Constructing patenting measures is
complicated, both because USPTO patents are assigned to patent classes but are not directly
matched to SIC codes, and because the multiple inventors of a given patent may be located in
different regions. We utilize a patent-SIC code concordance algorithm developed by Silverman
(1999), in which USPTO patents are assigned, on a fractional basis, to four-digit SIC codes in a
consistent (albeit somewhat noisy) manner. Each patent is then assigned, on a fractional basis,
among the locations of the inventors.
Cluster Definitions: Groupings of Related Industries
There are various types of economies of agglomerations identified in the literature,
including input-output linkages, labor market pooling, knowledge spillovers, local demand, and
specialized institutions, among others. Thus, a meaningful set of cluster definitions -- groups of
closely related industries -- should capture inter-industry linkages of various types.
The first step to create a grouping of industries is to define a ‘similarity matrix’ that
captures the relatedness between any pair of (narrowly defined) industries. In the second step,
some numerical method is used based on the similarity matrix to create groups (called clusters) in
a way that industries in the same cluster are more similar among themselves than to those in other

11

CBP data is made available at the county, state and US level. One problem of the CBP data is cell suppression to
protect the confidentiality of firms in certain geography-industry with small presence of firms. When employment
data is suppressed, a range is reported. We utilize the mid-point in the range in our data. We use the unsuppressed
Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) of the Census Bureau to replicate the employment growth analysis reported
in Table 2, and the results only change trivially.
12
In order to use EA-industry data back to 1990, the analysis employs SIC system rather than the NAICS system,
which was introduced in 1997. By construction, recent NAICS-based data can be translated (with some noise) into
the older SIC system. The use of NAICS or SIC definitions has no meaningful impact on our core empirical results.
13
There are 179 EAs covering the entirety of the United States. To minimize concerns about differences in
transportation costs and the definition of neighboring regions, we exclude the Alaska and Hawaii EAs. The EAs are
meaningful economic regions and have been highly stable over time (Johnson and Kort, 2004).

15

<-----Page 15----->clusters (see Everitt et al. 2011; Delgado, Porter and Stern, 2013). A set of cluster definitions will
provide the industry boundaries for any cluster (e.g., the Automotive cluster will contain 15
industries), and then clusters can be mapped into any regional unit (e.g., EAs in our analysis).
Some studies measure industry relatedness, but do not define regional clusters.

In

particular, Ellison and Glaeser (1997) and Ellison et al. (2010) measure the co-location between
industries using the conglomeration index (a similarity matrix), but do not create industry
groupings. Only a few studies define clusters, including Feser and Bergman (2000) and Feser
(2005) for input-output-based clusters; and Porter (2003) for industries related by any type of
externalities in both service and manufacturing.14
In this paper the cluster definitions are drawn from the US Cluster Mapping Project (Porter,
2003). The CMP develops a methodology for grouping four-digit SIC codes into clusters. The
methodology first distinguishes three types of industries with distinct competition and locational
drivers: traded, local, and natural resource-dependent. Local industries are those that serve
primarily the local markets (e.g., utilities) whose employment is roughly evenly distributed across
regions.

Resource-dependent industries are those whose location is tied to local resource

availability (e.g., logging). Traded industries are those that tend to be geographically concentrated
and produce goods and services that are sold across regions.15
Traded industries are the focus of our analysis. To measure the relatedness between any
pair of industries ij, the CMP computes the pairwise correlation of industry employment across
locations r (Correlation coefficient (employmentir, employmentjr)) in 1996. This measure is
referred as “locational correlation” of employment, and is based on revealed co-location patterns
to capture any type of externalities (skills, demand, supply, knowledge, and others) present across

14

Ellison and Glaeser (1997) study the coagglomeration of pairs of manufacturing industries, building an index that
reflects “excess” concentration. In a related paper, Ellison et al., (2010) test various mechanisms (input-output,
knowledge, labor pooling) inducing the coagglomeration of pairs of industries, and conclude that they all seem to
matter. This finding shows that there are many types of industry complementarities (see also Forni and Paba, 2002),
and is consistent with the clustering methodology developed in Porter (2003). In contrast, other studies focus on
specific types of linkages in terms of input-output (Feser, 2005), and technological, science-based and market
proximity (Scherer, 1982; Jaffe et al., 1993; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999; Neffke et al., 2011; Bloom et al., 2012).
While the studies mentioned examine interdependencies among industries, only a few studies group industries into
clusters, including Porter (2003) and Feser (2005). Finally, other studies focus on characterizing particular sets of
regional industries by examining their types of firms and their networks (see e.g., Saxenian, 1994; Boschma, 2005;
Aharonson, Baum, and Plunket, 2008; Lorenzen and Mudambi, 2013).
15
Traded industries account for 30% of US employment and over 87% of US patents.

16

<-----Page 16----->industries.16 Note that the locational correlation of employment and the coagglomeration Index of
Ellison and Glaeser (1997) are both pairwise industry similarity matrices based on co-location
patterns of pair of industries; and they are significantly correlated (Delgado et al., 2013).
Using the locational correlation of employment, the CMP then groups each of the 589
industries to one of 41 mutually exclusive clusters (referred to as “narrow cluster” definitions).
The industries are grouped into clusters based on an iterative process that increases within-cluster
relatedness.17 Within a cluster such as information technology, for example, there are 9 4-digit
SIC code industries, including electronic computers (SIC 3571) and software (SIC 7372),
reflecting the fact that location of employment in computer hardware and software are highly
correlated.18

The resulting clusters may contain service and manufacturing industries and

industries from different parts of the SIC system.19
The CMP also develops a “broad” cluster definitions in which a given industry may be
shared by multiple clusters (as inferred through the locational correlation of employment patterns),
identifying a broader set of related industries for each focal industry. While the narrow cluster
definitions form our key measures of related industries, we use the broader clusters to develop a
measure of the strength of related clusters surrounding a given region-cluster.
Other Industry Groupings. Delgado, Porter and Stern (2013) create a new clustering
methodology to generate and evaluate sets of cluster definitions. They validate the CMP
definitions that we use in this paper, and show that the individual clusters contain industries that
are highly related based on multiple types of linkages, including input-output and labor occupation
requirements. There are other industry groupings that could capture agglomerations that arise
among related industries. The simplest grouping will be industries with the same two-digit SIC
code, used in other studies (see e.g., Baptista and Swann, 1998; Frenken et al. 2007). This set of

16

The correlation coefficient is a well-known similarity measure used in cluster analysis (see Everitt et al. 2011). The
locational correlation of employment and the resulting CMP cluster definitions are derived based on 1996 regionindustry data and are fixed overtime. Pairwise locational correlation of employment change little over-time, so we
would not expect major changes in the cluster definitions during our time period.
17
Porter (2003) describes the methodology in detail. The primary classifications are based on locational correlation
of employment of region-industry pairs. However, it is possible that industries with high employment co-location
may have little economic relationship. Two adjustments are made to eliminate spurious correlations. First, the SIC
industry definitions are used to reveal logical links. Second, the National Input-Output accounts are used to identify
meaningful cross-industry flows.
18
See Table A2 and Porter (2003) for a comprehensive list of the 41 traded clusters and some key attributes.
19
For example, the Automotive cluster includes 15 (4-digit) industries that belong to 8 different 2-digit SIC codes.
On average clusters have industries with 4 different 2-digit SIC codes.

17

<-----Page 17----->cluster definitions group industries that are related based on their list of products/services; but it
fails to capture linkages between industries with different two-digit SICs (e.g., manufacturing and
services).20 Thus, groupings based purely on industry definitions perform worse in capturing
various types of inter-industry linkages than the CMP definitions.
Delgado, Porter and Stern (2013) propose a new set of cluster definitions -- referred here
as the Enhanced Cluster Definition ECD -- that incorporates current data and multiple industry
similarity matrices based on input-output, labor occupations, and the co-location patterns of
employment and establishments. The ECD groups the same set of industries as the CMP but using
the 2007 NAICS code. The ECD has a significant overlap with the CMP, but there are also relevant
differences since new data and clustering method are used.21
While the CMP cluster definitions are our key measures of clusters, we use the two-digit
SIC groupings and the ECD as alternative industry groupings to examine economies of
agglomeration that arise in groups of related industries.
Sample Description and Dependent Variable Definitions
The empirical analysis focuses on explaining the growth of existing regional industries by
using the sample of EA-industries that have a positive level of employment in 1990 (55083
observations). For this sample we define two dependent variables: EA-industry growth in
employment and in patenting over the period 1990-2005 (ln(Employmentir,2005/Employmentir,1990)
and ln(Patentingir,2005/Patentingir,1990)).22

To compute the employment growth rate for EA-

industries where we observe zero employment in 2005, we set employment equal to one for these
observations.23 We implement numerous sensitivity analyses involving alternative approaches to
deal with the zeros. We use the sample of regional industries that have positive employment in
both the base and the terminal period (sample of 48921 observations); vary the base and terminal
periods; (1990-1996 and 1997-2005 versus 1990-2005); and use the whole sample (including EAindustries with zero employment in 1990). Our main findings remain essentially unchanged.

20

For example, Frenken et al. (2007) define related diversity in a region by examining the diversity of industries
within a given 2-digit industry class (i.e., entropy at the five-digit level industries within each two-digit industry class);
and find that related diversity enhances regional employment growth.
21
The ECD is available as a beta release at the U.S. Cluster Mapping website (http://clustermapping.us).
22
Patenting irt are the new patents granted in year t at industry i in EA r.
23
Similarly, to compute the patenting growth of EA-industries with zero patenting in 1990 or 2005, we set patenting
equal to the minimum in the sample.

18

<-----Page 18----->Additionally, we examine the emergence of new to the region industries by using the
sample of EA-industries with zero measured employment in 1990 (48430 observations). The
dependent variable is a dummy variable equal to one if there is any positive level of employment
as of 2005 (Emergence2005; with a mean of 0.29 and a standard deviation of 0.45). These analyses
include probit specifications of the probability of having industries new to the region as of 2005
as a function of the initial cluster environment.
Explanatory Variables
To define our variables of the strength (relative presence) of a region-industry and the
strength of the cluster environment that surrounds the region-industry, we draw on a body of prior
work which uses location quotients (LQ) as a primary measure of regional specialization (Glaeser
et al. 1992, Porter 2003, among others). We compute two sets of explanatory variables – one set
based on employment and another set based on new patenting activity in 1990. We explain below
the employment-based variables, and the paten-based variables are defined similarly. Table 1
shows the descriptive statistics for all the variables.
Industry Specialization. Employment-based industry specialization in a region in the base
year is measured by the share of regional employment in the regional industry as compared to the
share of US employment in the national industry: Industry SpecEmploy,i,r,90 

employi,r employ r
employi,US employ US

,

where r and i indicate the region (EA) and the industry, respectively. This indicator captures the
degree to which the industry is “over-represented” (in terms of employment) in the EA. In our
sample, the Industry SpecEmploy variable has a mean of 2.34 and a standard deviation of 7.21 (Table
1). As noted earlier, we specify this variable in log form and include EA and industry fixed effects
in our model (equation 1), and so, the independent variation is driven exclusively by variation in
employment across EA-industries.
Cluster Specialization. We use a similar procedure to develop a measure for cluster
specialization. For a particular EA-industry the specialization of the EA in cluster c is measured
by the share of regional employment in the regional cluster (outside the industry) as compared to
the

share

of

. The average Cluster SpecEmploy is 1.31 (and the

19

<-----Page 19----->standard deviation is 2.20; Table 1). In our model (equation 1) the independent variation utilized
in the regressions comes from the employment within a given cluster.
Since cluster specialization is measured relative to the overall size of the region, a region
may exhibit specialization within a particular cluster even though that region only holds a small
share of the national employment of that cluster. While it is not surprising that leading regions in
the automotive cluster include Detroit-Warren-Flint (MI) and Cleveland-Akron-Elyria (OH), there
are pockets of automotive cluster strength in smaller regions, such as Lexington-Fayette-FrankfortRichmond (KY) and Louisville-Elizabethtown-Scottsburg (KY-IN).
It is important to note that the correlation between industry specialization and cluster
specialization is small (0.20). Some regions can have a high industry specialization, but low
strength in other related industries that constitute the cluster and vice-versa. These two variables,
while related, seem to capture different agglomeration forces -- those that take place within the
focal industry versus those that take place within the cluster (outside the region-industry).
Strength of Related Clusters. The measures of the strength of related clusters are developed
using the “broad” cluster definitions in Porter (2003). We identify as clusters related to a given
cluster c those broad clusters that have at least one of cluster c’s narrow industries in common.
For example, in the case of Automotive, related clusters include Production Technology and Metal
Manufacturing, among others.24 Having identified the set of clusters related to a given cluster
(C*), we then measure the degree of overlap between each pair of clusters (c, b) using the average
proportion

of

narrow

industries

that

are

in

cluster c is then defined by a weighted sum of the location quotients associated with each (narrow)
related cluster:

24

The set of related clusters selected using this method will be the most relevant ones for each given cluster c. Clusters
related with many other traded clusters include analytical instruments and communications equipment, among others;
and clusters with few connections to other clusters include tobacco and footwear.
25
For example, Automotive shares 5 narrow industries (out of 15) with the broad Production Technology, and
Production Technology shares 7 narrow industries (out of 23) with the broad Automotive. Their overlap is 0.32.

20

<-----Page 20----->For instance, based on this weighting which emphasizes the degree of overlap between clusters,
our measure of the strength of related clusters for industries within the automotive cluster weights
the presence of the metal manufacturing cluster more heavily than the presence of the furniture
cluster.
Strength in Neighboring Clusters. Specialization in a particular cluster tends to be
spatially correlated across neighboring regions – for example, the historical strength of the
automotive cluster near Detroit is likely reinforced by cluster specialization in automotive in
neighboring EAs such as Grand Rapids-Muskegon-Holland (MI), Toledo-Fremont (OH) and Fort
Wayne-Huntington-Auburn (IN).26 We develop a measure of the presence of similar clusters in
neighboring EAs (Cluster Spec in Neighbors variable) to explore the role of inter-regional cluster
spillovers in the growth of a given region-industry.

The inclusion of this variable allows

controlling for the fact that the geographical boundaries of clusters may expand across regions.27
We compute this variable as the average specialization (LQ) of adjacent EAs in the cluster based
on employment or patenting.

5.

Clusters and Employment Growth
We now turn to the key empirical findings on the role of clusters on regional economic

performance. We explore the effect of a strong cluster environment based on employment on
region-industry employment growth. Table 2 provides our main econometric specifications of
how the growth rate of EA-industry employment varies with the initial level of industry
specialization and the cluster environment in the region. We begin in (2-1) with a simple model
relating EA-industry employment growth to the (log of) initial level of employment-based industry
specialization (Industry SpecEmploy), and a comprehensive set of industry and EA fixed effects. The
estimated coefficient is negative, suggesting that convergence dominates the impact of
agglomeration at the region-industry level.
In model 2-2, we introduce a second variable (Cluster SpecEmploy), the initial employmentbased specialization of the region in the set of related industries constituting the cluster (excluding
the focal region-industry). This is our core specification, relying exclusively on variation in the

26

Table A1 shows that the specialization of a region in a given cluster is significantly correlated to the average
specialization of neighbors in the same cluster (correlation coefficient of 0.50).
27
Other studies use spatial density analysis to identify the geographical boundaries of individual industries rather than
using administrative regional units (e.g., see Duranton and Overman, 2005).

21

<-----Page 21----->employment strength of the cluster, conditioning on the overall growth rate for the region and
industry.28 While the coefficient on Industry Spec continues to be negative (and roughly of the
same magnitude), the coefficient on cluster specialization is positive and significant.

The

estimated annual rate of convergence in region-industry employment is 3.5%, which is similar to
the ~4% annual rate of convergence in city-sector employment found by Henderson et al. (1995).29
At the same time, a one standard-deviation increase above the mean in cluster specialization is
associated with a 1.3 percentage point increase in the expected annual employment growth of
region-industries.30 Our findings are not an artifact of particular high-growth industries or regions;
instead, our findings reflect a systematic relationship between cluster strength and the potential for
growth at the region-industry level.
While the findings in model 2-2 suggest that agglomeration forces arise in strong clusters,
congestion costs could be at work as well. Congestions costs could increase with the relative size
of the regional cluster and at some point dominate the agglomeration economies. For example this
could occur if the industries participating in the cluster share inputs and the costs of inputs increase
with the size of the cluster. In a sensitivity analysis, we examine non-linearities in the cluster
specialization effect in two ways (no reported). We first estimate the baseline model 2-2 using a
set of four dummies for the quartile values of cluster specialization (the omitted dummy is the
lowest quartile of Cluster SpecEmploy). The estimated coefficients of the quartile dummies are each
positive and significant and increasing for higher quartiles. Furthermore, we estimate model 2-2
allowing the coefficient of the Ln Cluster SpecEmploy to vary for each of its four quartile ranges.
The four estimated coefficients are positive and significant.

The findings suggest that

agglomeration effects prevail at the region-cluster level even for the strongest (top quartile)
regional clusters.
Relatedly, we also examine whether the estimated positive effect of cluster specialization
on region-industry growth is driven by regional industries with small relative size (and lower
congestion costs). We find that strong regional clusters matter for regional industries with either
28

In our sample of EA-industries with positive employment in 1990, there are observations with zero employment in
the cluster (outside the industry), in related clusters or in neighboring clusters. To use these observations, we replace
ln(variable) with its minimum value in the sample. To control for unobserved attributes of these types of observations
we add across all models a dummy equal to 1 if the particular variable was not corrected. For example, model (2-2)
includes a dummy equal to 1 if an EA-industry has any employment in 1990 in the cluster (outside the industry). All
our findings only change trivially when dropping these dummies.
29
The annual convergence rate is 100*(ln(δ+1))/-15) following Barro and Sala i Martin (1991).
30
The estimated 1.3% magnitude effect is computed as 100*(ln(3.517)-ln(1.315))*0.2 divided by 15 years.

22

<-----Page 22----->low or high employment specialization, with no relevant difference in the coefficients (not
reported).31
In model 2-3 we introduce two additional dimensions of the cluster environment: strength
in related clusters (Related Cluster SpecEmploy) and the presence of strong clusters in neighboring
regions (Cluster Spec in NeighborsEmploy). We find positive and significant coefficients for each
of the three measures of the cluster environment surrounding a particular region-industry.32 A one
standard-deviation increase above the mean in each of the aspects of the cluster environment is
associated with a 1.9 percentage point increase in the expected annual employment growth (1.0%,
0.4% and 0.5% for Cluster SpecEmploy, Related Clusters SpecEmploy and Cluster Spec in
NeighborsEmploy, respectively). 33
Table 2 includes a number of robustness checks by re-estimating the baseline model 2-2
using alternative industry groupings to measure regional clusters. In model 2-4 we run a Monte
Carlo falsification test in which we construct “random” clusters by randomly assigning the 589
industries into 41 clusters (without replacement). We repeat this process to create 2000 simulated
cluster definitions, and select the 200 cluster definitions that have the closest distribution to our
original cluster definitions (where closest is defined in terms of the distribution of size of clusters).
For each of the 200 random cluster definitions, we estimate the exact same specification as model
2-2. Model 2-4 reports the average coefficient from this exercise (with the standard errors based
on the empirical distribution from the simulation exercise). The coefficient associated with the
random cluster specialization measures are essentially zero and statistically insignificant. In other
words, cluster-driven agglomeration depends critically on grouping industries into meaningful
groups of related activities (Porter, 2003), and does not simply reflect random industry groupings.

31

To test this, we estimate the baseline model (2-2) allowing the coefficient of Cluster SpecEmploy to vary for regionindustries with low versus high Industry Spec (i.e., below versus above the median value in 1990).
32
Importantly, the inter-regional spillover effects are robust to using alternative weighting schemes for adjacent
regions (e.g., weighting more the neighboring clusters with higher levels of employment versus using the un-weighted
average). Furthermore, the inter-regional spillovers are higher when neighbors specialize in the same cluster than
when neighbors specialize in related clusters.
33
The findings in our core models (2-2 and 2-3) are robust to a number of additional sensitivity checks, such as using
the non-zero sub-sample (i.e., EA-industries with positive employment in both 1990 and 2005), using all EA-industries
(including those with zero employment in 1990), using alternative regional units (e.g., MSAs), dropping the 5%
smallest and largest EAs, and dropping small regional clusters that may consist mostly of sales and distribution offices
of clusters based elsewhere (i.e., for every cluster, we drop those regional clusters in the bottom 20% of the distribution
of employment). As described in Section 3, we also test for spatial correlation running a FAR model on the residuals
of models 2-2 and 2-3, under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. We cannot reject the null hypothesis.

23

<-----Page 23----->While the CMP definitions are meaningful, there are other industry groupings that could
capture relevant inter-industry interdependencies (Delgado et al. 2013). As discussed in Section
4, we use two alternative groupings: clusters based on two-digit SIC code groupings in model 2-5
and the ECD in model 2-6.
In model 2-5, we define related industries as all four-digit SIC code (traded) industries
within the same two-digit SIC. This grouping of industries captures some forms of relatedness,
but fails to capture complementarities among service and manufacturing industries. Despite these
limitations, the relationship between specialization in same 2-digit SIC industries (SIC2 Spec) and
EA-industry growth is positive and significant, consistent with our earlier findings. To assess the
differences between the CMP and SIC2 groupings, we also re-estimate the baseline model 2-2
adding both measures of the presence of related economic activity (Cluster SpecEmploy and SIC2
SpecEmploy). As expected the estimated coefficient of both variables decline, but each variable has
a positive and significant relationship with EA-industry employment growth. Using the CMP
definitions we can also measure the presence of related clusters in a region. To capture this
dimension of the cluster environment, we estimate the baseline model 2-2 adding the specialization
in clusters and in related clusters as well as the specialization in same 2-digit SIC industries (not
reported). The estimated coefficients of all these variables are statistically significant, with the
joint estimated coefficients of Cluster Spec and Related Cluster Spec significantly higher than that
of SIC2 Spec.34 These findings suggests that our baseline cluster variables capture relevant interindustry linkages beyond those based purely on industry definitions, but may not capture all types
of inter-industry agglomerations.
Finally, in model 2-6 we use the ECD cluster definitions, which rely on the NAICS 2007
industry code (6-digit NAICS industries). Since the ECD is based on more recent data we examine
region-industry employment growth in a later time period (2003-2010). The findings reported in
model 2-6 are very robust to our baseline model 2-2. There is a similar estimated EA-industry
annual convergence rate in both models (3.5 in model 2-6 versus 3.4 in model 2-2). The estimated
cluster effect is larger using the ECD. One standard deviation increase above the mean in Cluster

A one standard-deviation increase above the mean in these variables is associated with a 0.9%, 0.3% and 0.7%
increase in the expected annual employment growth, respectively.

percentage points in model 2-2).
When Do Clusters Matter More for Employment Growth?
While our findings highlight a positive relationship between the cluster environment and
region-industry employment growth, prior work suggests that the impact of agglomeration forces
can vary across types of regions, clusters, and industries. For example, some of the externalities
and complementarities harnessed by strong clusters may be subject to economies of scale and
scope. Thus, the size of the local region can matter.
We examine how the effect of cluster externalities on region-industry employment growth
varies by region size, cluster size, and industry types in Table 3. We investigate the role of region
size in model 3-1 by introducing a set of interaction effects between industry and cluster
specialization and a dummy variable (Large EA) which is equal to one for large regions (above the
median employment). The main findings hold for large and small EAs – significant convergence
at region-industry level and agglomerations at the cluster level (outside the region-industry).
However, there are important differences. The estimated region-industry convergence effect is
higher in larger EAs. Region-industries tend to have higher employment levels in larger EAs and
are subject to greater reversion to the mean. Notably, the impact of clusters on employment growth
is greater in larger EAs as well. The size of the local market, greater economies of scale in
specialized inputs, and the supply of public goods in larger regions (e.g., universities) could
explain this result.
To better examine how region heterogeneity affects our results, we take advantage of the
fact that each EA contains multiple industries and clusters, and re-estimate the baseline
employment growth model (model 2-2 in Table 2) allowing for EA-specific coefficients for
industry and cluster specialization. The estimated coefficients of Ln Cluster Spec Employ for each
of the 177 EAs are plotted in Figure 1a, separating out large and small regions. The EA-specific
industry specialization coefficients are always negative (not reported). In contrast, the EA-specific
cluster specialization coefficients are always positive; and larger EAs tend to have greater
estimated cluster effects, consistent with the results in model 3-1. The results suggest that our
overall findings – convergence at the level of the industry, agglomeration at the level of the cluster
– are not the result of a set of outlier regions but represent a robust tendency in the data.

25

<-----Page 25----->We then examine the sensitivity of our results to cluster heterogeneity. We start in model
3-2 by studying the role of size of the national cluster. We introduce a set of interaction effects
between industry and cluster specialization and a dummy variable (Large Cluster) which is equal
to one for the top-20 US clusters based on total employment as of 1990 (See Table A2 for list of
large clusters). The main findings hold for large and small US clusters. However, the estimated
cluster effect is higher in large US clusters, which have a broader array of industries or larger
individual industries and may better exploit economies of scope and scale.
We further investigate the heterogeneity across clusters by estimating separate industry and
cluster specialization coefficients for each of the 41 clusters. We estimate a model similar to 2-2
(Table 2) but allow for cluster-specific coefficients. The results are presented in Figure 1b, which
plots the empirical distribution of the Ln Cluster Spec coefficients separating out large and small
US clusters. The cluster-specific coefficients are presented in Table A2 in the Appendix. Notably,
the industry specialization coefficient is always negative and statistically significant, and the
cluster specialization coefficient is almost always positive and statistically significant (except for
two clusters -- Distribution Services and Entertainment). This suggests that our results are not
driven by particular types of clusters. However, there are relevant differences across clusters.
Figure 1b illustrates that industries in larger US clusters tend to have greater cluster effects,
consistent with the results in (3-2).
Table A2 shows that industries in high-tech manufacturing clusters (i.e., high patent
intensity clusters) seem to have on average a greater estimated Cluster SpecEmploy coefficient (e.g.,
Analytical Instruments and Production Technology). These cluster differences are better
understood by examining the type of industries within clusters. Industries are heterogeneous in
many dimensions, including their propensity to patent (higher in manufacturing) and the diversity
of consumers (higher in service). Industries can then vary in the extent of agglomeration benefits
within clusters. We examine these differences in Table 3 in model 3-3 by defining three (mutually
exclusive) types of industries. A total of 146 industries are classified as service industries (based
on SIC codes). The manufacturing industries are classified into ‘high-tech’ and ‘low-tech’ based
on patent intensity in 1990. A total of 147 industries with 2 or more patents granted by 1,000
workers (higher quartile of patent intensity) are classified as high-tech manufacturing; and the
other 296 industries are low-tech manufacturing. We find that not only do cluster agglomerations
matter for the employment growth of high-tech manufacturing industries, but also of service and

26

<-----Page 26----->low-tech manufacturing industries. This result adds to the previous literature that focused
primarily on the effect of external agglomerations on high-tech manufacturing industries. There
are also meaningful differences across industry types. Services industries experience the largest
region-industry convergence. This could be partially attributed to the larger size of service
industries.

In contrast, high-tech manufacturing industries experience significantly lower

convergence and higher cluster effects on employment growth than the service industries (as
indicated by the positive and significant coefficients of High-Tech*Ln Industry SpecEmploy and
High-Tech*Ln Cluster SpecEmploy). The more salient cluster effect for high-patent intensive
industries is consistent with the documented higher geographical concentration of innovative
activity in the United States (Audrestch and Feldman, 1996), and could be attributed to various
types of supply-side and demand-side agglomeration forces.
Our results suggest that industries within regional clusters with larger (relative)
employment size have greater opportunities for employment growth, a finding that is robust across
regions, clusters, and industry-types. We recognize that this relationship could be correlated with
unobserved region-cluster and region-industry specific policies and initiatives such as the presence
of local institutions or policies that support the growth of a particular regional cluster, or lower tax
rates for the smaller industries within a larger cluster. While we cannot make a causal assertion in
the absence of exogenous variation in the cluster environment, the robustness of our findings
across regions and clusters suggests a positive relationship between the initial employment-based
cluster strength and the employment growth of industries within the cluster.

6.

The Duality between Employment and Innovation within Clusters
We have shown that the initial employment strength of a cluster seems to contribute to

region-industry employment growth. We next explore if the initial innovation strength of a cluster
generates knowledge spillovers that facilitate region-industry employment growth.
We examine the duality between employment and innovation performance in clusters in
Table 4 by characterizing the cluster strength using both employment and patenting (Ln Cluster
SpecEmploy and Ln Cluster SpecPatent). These two variables have a low positive correlation (0.24,
Table A1), which suggests that they emphasize different types of agglomerations. Some regional
clusters have high employment strength and low patenting strength as of 1990 (e.g., the chemical

27

<-----Page 27----->cluster in Memphis, TN-MS-AR), and others have high patenting strength and low employment
strength (e.g., the chemical cluster in New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA).35
The employment strength of a cluster captures most (though probably not all) types of
supply-side and demand-side externalities (input-output, skills, technology, etc.). The patenting
strength of a cluster emphasizes the potential for knowledge externalities, but could also capture
input-output and other externalities. Controlling for employment-based cluster strength, we assess
whether patenting-based cluster strength relates positively to region-industry employment growth.
This would suggest that innovation in the cluster is important for the employment growth of the
industries in the cluster, and that knowledge linkages may be a relevant mechanism at work.
We begin in model 4-1 by estimating region-industry employment growth using a modified
version of equation 1, with the initial cluster strength based on patenting and employment. We
find that the patenting strength and the employment strength of the cluster each seem to contribute
to industry employment growth.36 The positive estimated effect of patenting cluster strength after
controlling for employment cluster strength suggests that knowledge externalities matter for
employment creation. The positive estimated coefficient of employment cluster strength suggests
that a broader set of mechanisms, such as access to specialized inputs and sophisticated demand,
are also at work, but we cannot assess the relative importance of each type of mechanism.
Model 4-2 shows the most comprehensive specification with all the cluster environment
variables (cluster, related clusters and neighboring clusters) based on employment and patenting.
It confirms the findings in model 4-1. The estimated effects of the employment and patenting
strength in the cluster are each positive and significant. In contrast, only the employment strength
in related clusters and in neighboring clusters seem to matter for employment growth. This
suggests that the complementarities between employment and innovation may be more relevant
within the focal cluster than in related clusters or in neighboring clusters.

35

The chemical cluster in Memphis, TN-MS-AR contained 16 industries, and for each of them, the employment
specialization of the region in the other 15 chemical industries was high (Cluster SpecEmploy above 2 – top quartile),
while the patenting specialization was low (Cluster SpecPatent around 0.5 – below median). In contrast, the chemical
cluster in New York-Newark-Bridgeport had 20 industries, and for each of them the employment specialization of the
region in the other 19 chemical industries was low (below 1), while the patenting specialization was high (above 1.5).
36
The coefficient of the employment-based cluster strength is significantly higher than that of the patenting-based
cluster strength. A one-standard deviation increase above the mean for Cluster SpecEmploy and Cluster SpecPatent is
associated with a 1.2% and 0.3% increase in the annual employment growth of an EA-industry, respectively.

28

<-----Page 28----->Clusters and Patenting Growth
The analysis thus far has focused on the role of regional clusters in employment growth.
To better understand the interplay between innovation and employment performance in clusters,
we also examine the role of regional clusters in region-industry innovation growth. Is a regionindustry patenting growth facilitated by the pre-existing patenting in the cluster, by the pre-existing
employment in the cluster or by both?
We examine these questions in Table 5. We begin in (5-1) with a model relating EAindustry patenting growth to the initial level of patent-based industry specialization and cluster
specialization, and a comprehensive set of industry and EA fixed effects. We find that higher
initial level of patenting in an EA-industry is associated with a reduction in the growth rate in the
number of granted patents. The estimated annual rate of convergence is above 11%. 37 However,
an initially stronger cluster based on patenting is associated with an increase in the growth rate of
patenting. The strength of related clusters and neighboring clusters also contribute to patenting
growth (model 5-2). A one standard-deviation increase above the mean in each of the aspects of
the patenting-based cluster environment is associated with a 1.2 percentage point increase in the
expected annual patenting growth (0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5% for Cluster SpecPatent, Related Clusters
SpecPatent and Cluster Spec in NeighborsPatent, respectively). This positive relationship between
clusters and patenting growth is consistent with studies that find that firms’ innovative activity
relates to the presence of knowledge externalities in a location (see e.g., Audretsch, 1998; Baptista
and Swann, 1998; Feldman and Audretsch, 1999).38
We then examine whether there are complementarities between employment and patenting
within clusters that improve the patenting of the individual industries in the clusters. We test this
in model 5-3 by estimating a modified version of equation 2, with the initial cluster strength
measured based both on employment and patenting. We find that the initial patenting and
employment strength of a cluster each has a positive and significant relationship with patenting
growth, with no statistical difference between the variables. The positive estimated coefficient of
Cluster SpecEmploy suggests that the employment strength of the cluster facilitates opportunities for
37

The large convergence rate for region-industry patenting is consistent with large convergence effects in regionindustry wages and productivity in other studies (see e.g., Henderson et al. 1995; Cingano and Schivardi, 2004).
38
Similarly to the analysis in Table 3, we examine the impact of region size, cluster size, and industry types on industry
patenting growth. The main finding in model 5-1 - agglomerations at the cluster level - hold for large and small
regions and US clusters. The initial patenting strength of the cluster matters for the patenting growth of all types of
industries, but the estimated coefficient is significantly larger for high-tech industries than service.

29

<-----Page 29----->innovation. The most comprehensive model (5-4) with all the cluster environment variables
(cluster, related clusters, and neighboring clusters) based on both employment and patenting shows
that all these variables have a positive estimated coefficient. These findings are consistent with a
broad set of externalities arising in clusters, related clusters and neighboring clusters.
Overall, our findings suggest that there are complementarities between employment and
innovation performance in clusters. Region-industry growth in employment and patenting are
each positively associated with the pre-existing cluster strength in terms of both employment and
innovation.

Importantly, these results hold for each type of industry (service, low-tech

manufacturing, and high-tech manufacturing).39 We interpret this as suggestive evidence that
multiple types of externalities arise across related industries within clusters.

7.

Emergence of New Regional Industries
The analysis to this point has shown the positive relationship between the cluster

environment and the growth of existing regional industries. We next examine whether the
externalities that arise in clusters also relate to the emergence of industries new to the region.
Building on studies of industry dynamics (Swann 1998; Porter 1998; Klepper 2007, 2010; Neffke,
Henning, and Boschma, 2011; Frenken, Cefis and Stam, 2011), we use the cluster framework to
explore the role of a strong initial cluster environment in the sub-sequent emergence of related
industries in the cluster. Rather than focusing on particular types of linkages between new and
existing industries, our measures of initial strength in a cluster will capture various types of
linkages that could be relevant for the emergence of industries.
The results are presented in Table 6. A higher level of cluster specialization measured by
employment (model 6-1) is positively associated with an increase in the probability of the
emergence of new regional industries as of 2005 (the estimated marginal effect is 0.033).40 Model
6-2 includes the regional cluster strength based both in employment and patenting. Both variables
are positively associated with the emergence of new regional industries; but the estimated marginal
effect of the employment-based cluster strength is significantly higher (0.032 versus 0.009). This

39

There are some differences across industry types. The patenting strength in the regional cluster is more relevant for
the growth of high-tech manufacturing industries than for service industries. This is consistent with the idea that
knowledge externalities are more important for patent-intensive industries than for service industries, but could also
be the result of relevant knowledge externalities not being fully captured with the patenting in the cluster.
40
This finding is robust to using alternative industry groupings to define cluster strength: 2-digit SIC and the ECD.

30

<-----Page 30----->suggests that multiple types of externalities within clusters contribute to the emergence of new
industries. Importantly, we test that this positive cluster effect is not restricted to manufacturing
industries. The cluster strength facilitates the entry of new service industries as well.
We then specify in (6-3) a comprehensive model of the cluster environment using the
employment-based variables (Cluster SpecEmploy, Related Cluster SpecEmploy and Cluster Spec in
NeighborsEmploy), and find that each is associated with a significantly higher probability of the
emergence of new regional industries.41 The estimated probability of new industry emergence in
a region is 0.22 at the mean of the explanatory variables and increases to 0.32 (45% increase) if
the cluster environment variables are valued at the mean plus one-standard-deviation. The findings
are robust in (6-4) to including both the employment and patenting cluster environment variables.
While the existence of inter-regional spillovers that influence the entry of an industry to a particular
region has been neglected in most prior studies, we find that the strength of neighboring clusters
contributes to the emergence of industries new to the region. These findings call for further
research on the flow of knowledge, labor, and other inputs across nearby regions.
Our analysis suggests that the initial cluster strength (based on employment and patenting)
facilitates the emergence of industries in a regional cluster. The emergence of industries could be
driven by different types of firms: start-ups of various types or incumbents firms entering through
existing or new facilities (Dunne et al. 1988; Feldman et al. 2005; Klepper 2007; Frenken and
Boschman, 2007; Delgado, Porter and Stern, 2010; Baptista and Presto, 2010). For incumbent
firms, the decision to enter into a new regional industry will be affected by their pre-existing spatial
organization of value chain activities (Alcacer and Delgado, 2013). The study of the types of firms
and networks that drive the emergence and growth of regional industries within clusters is an
important area for future research.

8.

Conclusions
In this paper we investigate the role of cluster agglomerations in the growth of individual

industries located within a cluster. We find the co-existence of convergence at the region-industry
with agglomeration economies across related industries within clusters. The rate of growth of
employment of a region-industry is declining in the initial level of employment at the regionindustry. At the same time, industries located in a cluster with higher initial employment strength
41

This result holds with the exclusion of region and industry fixed effects.

31

<-----Page 31----->in related industries are associated with higher employment growth, a finding which is robust
across different regions, clusters, and industry-types.

Industry employment growth is also

increasing with the strength of related clusters in the region and with the strength of similar clusters
in geographically adjacent regions.
We also find that there are complementarities between the employment and innovation
performance in clusters. The initial employment and patenting strength of a regional cluster each
is positively associated with region-industry growth in employment and patenting. These findings
inform the debate on the importance of co-locating production and innovation for regional
performance (Dertouzos et al. 1989; Porter and Rivkin, 2012; Berger, 2013). Furthermore, this
analysis offers suggestive evidence that a broad set of externalities, such as knowledge spillovers,
access to specialized inputs and sophisticated demand, arise in clusters.
We also use the cluster framework to study the role of a strong initial cluster environment
in the emergence of new industries in the region. Our analysis shows that new regional industries
in services and manufacturing are born out of strong regional clusters. Importantly, the strength
of the cluster in geographically adjacent regions also seems to matter for the emergence of regional
industries. These findings suggest that cluster agglomerations play a role in the path of regional
diversification (Porter 1990, 1998; Swann, 1992, 1998; Neffke et al. 2011).
These findings, taken together, have a number of implications. First, the traditional
distinction between industry specialization and regional diversity is misplaced. This dichotomy
overlooks the role played by complementary economic activity in shaping economic growth, and
the role of clusters as the manifestation of complementarity. Narrow regional specialization in an
industry is likely to result in diminishing returns. However, the presence of complementary
activity via clusters relates positively to growth. Clusters may encourage various agglomeration
mechanisms including firms ready access to key inputs, better interactions with customers, and
better experimentation and innovation opportunities.
Second, prior studies

have focused on

individual channels

through which

complementarities might operate. Building on Feldman and Audretsch (1999), for example,
numerous studies have emphasized the role of the local scientific knowledge base and the potential
for knowledge spillovers in shaping opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship. While our
results are consistent with such findings, the impact of related economic activity on economic
performance is broader.

The presence of clusters, which foster multiple types of

32

<-----Page 32----->complementarities, seems to be a driver of the emergence and growth of industries for all industry
types.
Our findings also carry several policy implications. One is that effective regional policy
should prioritize complementarities across related economic activity rather than seek to attract any
type of investment, or favor particular high-technology fields such as biotechnology or software if
the region has little strength in those areas. Instead the focus should be on how to leverage a
region’s strong clusters, and foster complementarities between innovation and production (Porter,
1990, 1998, 2003; Rodríguez-Clare, 2005, 2007; Ketels and Memedovic, 2008; Berger, 2013).
Our results suggest that the growth of existing regional industries as well as the emergence
of new regional industries depend on the cluster composition across nearby regions rather than
within narrow political boundaries.

The benefits arising from clusters often span multiple

jurisdictions (and even states). Policies that enhance complementarities across jurisdictions, such
as supporting infrastructure and institutions that facilitate access to demand, skills or suppliers in
neighboring clusters, may be important tools for regional development. More research is needed
to assess the role of specific state and Federal-level policies in catalyzing cluster growth.
Our analysis also proposes several directions for future research. While the current
analysis takes the initial state of the cluster environment as a given, and holds cluster definitions
constant, cluster structure can evolve over time. For example, whereas electronic computers may
have been the central industry within the information technology cluster on an historical basis,
software may be the core industry within that cluster going forward. However, few studies have
examined how the co-location patterns of industries change over time, or the role of the historical
composition of industries in a region in shaping new industry growth (Klepper, 2007, 2010).
Understanding the drivers of the evolution of clusters, particularly the types of firms and networks,
is a crucial direction for future research.
Finally, qualitative studies of clusters emphasize the central role of specialized local
institutions (from training facilities to infrastructure investments) in allowing potential
complementarities to be realized (Porter and Emmons, 2003; Sölvell et al., 2006). While the
precise design, role, and operation of such institutions varies widely by circumstance, little
theoretical or empirical research has examined the impact of these localized institutions in shaping
regional economic performance.

Notes: Bold and Bold-Italic numbers refer to coefficients significant at 1% and 5% levels, respectively. The sample
conditions on EA-industries with zero employment in 1990. The reported coefficients are the marginal effects of the
estimated probit model. Standard errors are clustered by EA-Cluster. Model 1 includes a dummy equal to 1 any
employment in 1990 in the cluster (outside the industry); similarly all models include dummies equal to 1 if the
explanatory variable has been corrected because of zero employment or zero patents. Our findings only change trivially
when dropping these dummies.
