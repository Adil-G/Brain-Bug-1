any research universities engage in efforts to license inventions developed by
university-afﬁliated inventors. However, no systematic explanation of the conditions
under which university inventions will be licensed or commercialized has been provided.
Drawing on transaction cost economics, I provide a conceptual framework to explain which
university inventions are most likely to be licensed, commercialized, and generate royalties,
and who will undertake that commercialization. I test this framework on data on the 1,397
patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1980–1996 period.
The results show that (1) university inventions are more likely to be licensed when patents are
effective; (2) when patents are effective, university technology is generally licensed to noninventors; (3) when patents are effective, licensing back to inventors increases the likelihood
of license termination and reduces the likelihood of invention commercialization; and (4) the
effectiveness of patents increases royalties earned for inventions licensed to noninventors.
The implications of these ﬁndings for innovation management and strategy, entrepreneurship, and university technology commercialization are discussed.

Introduction

Recent years have witnessed rapid growth in
university technology licensing activity and supporting institutional arrangements. From 1980 to 1997,
the number of universities licensing technology has
grown eightfold, to over 200 (Thursby and Kemp
forthcoming). From 1991 to 1996, the number of university licensing agreements has grown by 70%, and
the real dollar value of royalties has doubled (Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM)
1997. Moreover, many universities have adopted
speciﬁc policies and procedures to encourage technology licensing, including rules on information disclosure, consulting arrangements, royalty payments, and
equity investments. Several universities (e.g., Iowa
State University) have even incorporated technology
licensing into their strategic plans.
However, this university technology licensing activity has occurred in the absence of any systematic

explanation of which university inventions will be
licensed and commercialized or who will conduct
that commercialization. This absence of information
is surprising since researchers have recognized that
approximately half of all university patents are never
licensed, and that licensing activity is not randomly
distributed across patents (Jensen and Thursby 2001,
Hsu and Bernstein 1997, Barnes et al. 1997).1
In this paper, I draw on the transaction cost economics literature to identify the conditions under
which university technology will be successfu1ly
licensed and commercialized. I argue that university inventions are more likely to be licensed when
patents are an effective mechanism for appropriating
the returns to innovation because the patent system

earning royalties in the biological rather than the physical sciences

reduces the transaction costs of technology transfer.
When patents are ineffective, university technology
is likely to be licensed back to noninventors because
inventor commercialization mitigates the information
problems that plague markets for inventions.
When patents are effective, licensing to noninventors reduces the likelihood of license termination,
and increases the likelihood of invention commercialization, by allowing commercialization to be undertaken by economic actors who possess a comparative advantage in that activity. As a result, the effectiveness of patents in a line of business will increase
the royalties earned for inventions licensed to noninventors.
I test these arguments by examining (1) the hazard
rate of licensing for the population of 1,397 patents
assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) from 1980 to 1996, (2) the probability that the
licensee of the 717 licensed patents will be a noninventor, (3) the hazard rate of license termination
and invention commercialization for the population of
966 patent-licensing efforts2 between 1980 and 1996,
and (4) the royalties paid to MIT for the 167 patents
licensed to noninventors from time of license through
1997.
Examination of university technology licensing
from a contracting perspective is valuable for three
reasons. First, universities are increasing their efforts
to license technology. A framework that explains
which inventions will be successfully licensed and
commercialized provides insight into the conditions
under which universities will be able to use licensing as a mechanism to earn ﬁnancial returns. Second, the application of a contracting perspective to
university technology licensing yields useful implications for the literature on innovation strategy and
management by providing insight into the licensing
and self-commercialization of inventions. Third, the
transaction cost framework provides valuable implications for the entrepreneurship literature by explaining the conditions under which inventors will become
entrepreneurs.

There are more “licensing efforts” than licensed patents because
“licensing efforts” examine each attempt by a ﬁrm to license a
patent, and some patents are licensed by more than one ﬁrm.

Appropriability, Contracting
Costs, and the Licensing of
University Technology

The best solution for university technology commercialization requires that economic actors who have a
comparative advantage in that activity commercialize
the technology. On average, the inventors of university technology do not have a comparative advantage in technology commercialization. Technology
commercialization involves a set of skills—including
identifying customer needs, developing product concepts, designing products and processes, prototyping,
and manufacturing—that university inventors rarely
possess.
The superiority of other parties at the commercialization of university inventions generates opportunities to gain from trade (Pisano and Mang 1993). In the
absence of problems in markets for knowledge, the
licensing of inventions to those advantaged in technology commercialization provides a mechanism for
allocating inventions to those actors who are best able
to commercialize them (Teece 1980).3 Trade, in turn,
increases the returns from technology commercialization. The division of the surplus that results from
the more efﬁcient use of resources makes both parties
3
The skills necessary for successful technology commercialization are largely tacit and are developed through a process of
learning-by-doing (Teece 1981). As a result, these skills are not sold
effectively in markets (Teece et al. 1997). Therefore, if invention
and technology commercialization are combined through marketmediated transactions, this combination will result from the sale
of inventions to economic actors with a comparative advantage
in technology commercialization, rather than the sale of technology commercialization skills to economic actors with a comparative
advantage in invention.

better off than if university inventors commercialized
technology in an autarkic manner.
The solution described above is contingent on
the effective functioning of markets for inventions.
However, three information problems—adverse selection, moral hazard, and hold-up—prevent markets for
inventions from working effectively. Adverse selection occurs when opportunistic sellers of low quality
inventions misrepresent the quality of their inventions
as high quality because potential buyers cannot easily
discern the value of inventions (Anton and Yao 1994).
Moral hazard occurs when the parties to the transaction shirk on the provision of inputs to the technology
transfer process because the ability to verify their provision is low (Arora 1996). Hold-up occurs when the
parties to the transaction opportunistically renegotiate the terms of the technology transfer agreement to
take advantage of speciﬁc investments made by the
other side (Pisano 1989).
Adverse selection exists in markets for inventions because these markets are plagued by disclosure problems. To minimize adverse selection, Arrow
(1962) explained that buyers are unwilling to pay for
knowledge unless the value of that knowledge can be
demonstrated. However, demonstration requires the
seller to disclose her knowledge; and once the invention has been disclosed, the buyer has no incentive to
pay for it (Anton and Yao 1994).
Moral hazard exists because third parties cannot
verify effectively the quality and quantity of knowledge transfer. The buyer may refuse to pay for
knowledge that has been transferred since she cannot be forced to unlearn the transferred knowledge
(Arora 1996). At the same time, the seller may shirk
on the transfer of knowledge to economize on its cost
(Arora 1995).
Hold-up exists because the commercialization of
technology is inherently uncertain, markets are thin,
and complete contracts cannot be written (Pisano
1991). As a result, both sides are obliged to leave some
subjects open for future negotiation. However, these
agreements to “agree in the future” provide an incentive for both parties to opportunistically renegotiate
the terms of the agreement after the other side has
made a relationship-speciﬁc investment (Pisano 1989,
p. 114).
124

The use of patents reduces adverse selection, moral
hazard, and hold-up problems in technology transfer. Patent protection mitigates adverse selection by
reducing the disclosure problem (Arrow 1962). The
possession of a patent allows the seller to disclose
an invention to a potential buyer while retaining the
property rights to the invention after disclosure. If the
disclosure convinces the buyer that the invention has
value, patent protection will force the buyer to pay
for the invention if she wants to use it (Anton and
Yao 1994).
The use of patents also minimizes moral hazard.
Patents allow at least some dimensions of the quality
and extent of knowledge transfer to be veriﬁed effectively by third parties, minimizing the incentive for
shirking (Anand and Khanna 2000). Moreover, when
patents protect the codiﬁed components of a transferred invention, the enforcement of patents can be
used as a bargaining tool to ensure that parties do
not engage in moral hazard with respect to uncodiﬁed
components (Arora 1996).
Finally, patents minimize the potential for holdup. When information is codiﬁed in patents, it can
be made less ambiguous, and contracts governing its
transfer can be made more complete (Teece 1981).
More complete contracts reduce the threat of holdup by mitigating the potential for ex-post haggling
over unspeciﬁed terms. In contrast, when information is tacit, it must be transferred through interpersonal contact, and economic actors must develop
relationship-speciﬁc assets to facilitate that transfer
(Pisano 1991). This approach raises the potential for
hold-up. Because parties to a transaction cannot take
back relationship-speciﬁc assets used to facilitate the
transfer of knowledge, the parties will lose the value
of sunk relationship-speciﬁc investments if an agreement is terminated (Williamson 1975). As a result, the
parties become locked into the transaction, increasing the potential for opportunistic renegotiation of the
agreement (Pisano 1989).
Since patents reduce the information problems
inherent in markets for inventions, patented university inventions should be licensed relatively easily. However, in practice, the effectiveness of patents
varies signiﬁcantly across technologies (Mansﬁeld
1981). In some ﬁelds, patents can be invented around

Selling University Technology

at low cost, whereas, in others, they provide strong
protection for their duration (Teece 1986). Patents are
less effective when they are unlikely to be held valid
if challenged, if ﬁrms cannot enforce them, if competitors can legally “invent around” patents, if the technology is moving so fast that patents are irrelevant, if
patent documents require disclosure of too much proprietary information, if licensing is required by court
decisions, or if ﬁrms participate in cross-licensing
agreements with competitors (Levin et al. 1987).
Given the importance of patents in mitigating failure in markets for inventions, the effectiveness of
patents in a line of business should encourage university technology licensing. Some prior work provides initial support for this idea. In case studies of
14 inventions licensed from MIT and Harvard University, Hsu and Bernstein (1997) found that ﬁrms
were more interested in licensing in sectors in which
patents provided a strong competitive advantage.
Similarly, Barnes et al. (1997) found a signiﬁcant effect
on licensing for a patent effectiveness control variable
in their study of license and citation patterns for University of California patents. This argument leads to
the ﬁrst hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. The greater the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the greater the likelihood that university inventions in that line of business will be licensed.
The above argument also suggests that when
patents are effective, the best solution to technology
commercialization is possible: University inventions
will be sold to the economic actors best able to commercialize the inventions. As explained, on average,
parties outside of universities have a comparative
advantage in commercializing technology. Therefore,
when patents are effective in a line of business, university technology will be licensed primarily to noninventors, and noninventors will be more successful
at commercializing that technology.
However, when patents are ineffective, markets
for knowledge do not work effectively. Under these
circumstances, the second-best solution—inventor
commercialization—will occur. To reduce the adverse
selection, moral hazard, and hold-up problems that
plague markets for inventions, inventors will found
ﬁrms to commercialize their own inventions. If the
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

inventor commercializes her own technology, disclosure problems, the incentive for moral hazard, and
hold-up are mitigated (Teece 1980). This argument
leads to the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2. The greater the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the greater the likelihood that the
licensee of a university invention will be a noninventor.
Hypothesis 3. The greater the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the greater the likelihood that university inventions licensed by inventors will be abandoned
prior to commercialization.
Hypothesis 4. The greater the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the lesser the likelihood that university
inventions licensed by inventors will reach commercialization.
Hypothesis 5. The greater the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the greater the magnitude of royalties
generated from licenses to noninventors.

The Context: Technology
Licensing at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology

This paper explores the licensing of MIT-assigned
patents over the 1980–1996 period. I focus on MIT’s
patents over this timeframe because both the institutional context and the time period are useful for
explaining university technology licensing. The focus
on MIT mitigates bias that might result from the
investigation of new entrants into technology licensing. Although the ﬁrst university technology licensing
efforts took place at the University of California at
Berkeley and the University of Chicago, MIT was one
of the earliest universities to establish a formal technology transfer organization (in 1932). Moreover, MIT
is the most important source of university technology
creation in the United States. The top 20 universities
patent approximately 70% of all university patents,
and MIT alone accounts for approximately 8% of the
total (Henderson et al. 1998).
The focus on the leading university patent generator provides several advantages for this study. First,
high patenting universities generate higher quality
inventions (Henderson et al. 1998), which are more

Selling University Technology

likely to be licensed. By exploring MIT’s patents, I
can explore licensing in a university with a relatively even distribution of licensed and unlicensed
patents. Second, high patenting universities are more
likely to receive signiﬁcant private sector interest in
their inventions. This level of interest reduces the
likelihood that licensing is explained by idiosyncratic
factors, which may explain licensing at universities
where the level of patenting is too low to warrant
formal scanning by private ﬁrms. Third, by focusing
on the highest patenting university, the study is able
to draw conclusions about an institution that has a
signiﬁcant impact on private sector economic activity even if generalization cannot be made to other
settings.4
Furthermore, MIT’s policies provide a good setting
for a natural experiment to determine which inventions are licensed. Unlike many universities (e.g.,
Columbia University and the University of California)
that will not patent an invention until the licensing ofﬁce has identiﬁed a licensee, MIT will patent
inventions on speculation.5 The policy of making the
patenting decision before the licensing decision mitigates sample selection bias that would hamper investigation of licensing at universities that do not patent
unless they have already identiﬁed a licensee.
The examination of technology licensing in the
post-1980 timeframe is also valuable. The year 1980
marked a watershed in university technology licensing. Before 1980, the property rights to all federally funded inventions resided with the federal
government. Although universities could apply for
patents on inventions resulting from federally funded
research, they had little incentive to do so. In the preBayh–Dole era, universities could earn income from
4

Unfortunately, I have little information on technology licensing
from other universities on which to compare MIT. Although the
fraction of MIT inventions that have been licensed may “seem
high,” no information on the cross-university proportion of patents
that are licensed is publicly available. However, one variable that is
available (for 122 universities from 1991–1998) is the ratio of license
and option agreements executed to patents issued. On this measure, MIT is not signiﬁcantly different from the mean at the p < 005
level.

those patents only if they received a title rights waiver
from the government agency funding the research
(Henderson et al. 1998). Consequently, prior to 1980,
few universities engaged in technology licensing, and
the volume of licensing was quite limited.
In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act, which
gave universities the rights to income from inventions that resulted from federally funded research
(Henderson et al. 1998). Moreover, in 1984, Congress
expanded these rights with Public Law 98-620, which
increased the range of inventions from which universities could proﬁt, and the ease with which they could
transfer those property rights. The transformation of
university property rights in the post-Bayh–Dole era
makes investigation of this period important.

Methodology

Sample and Analysis
The ﬁrst part of this study investigates the 1,397
patents made by faculty, staff, and students of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) between
1980 and 1996 and subsequently assigned to the institute. In this analysis, I use Cox proportional hazard duration models to examine the hazard of ﬁrst
license.6
The second part of the study examines who (inventors or noninventors) were the licensees for the population of 717 patents licensed between 1980 and 1996.
In this analysis, I use logistic regression to examine
the probability of license by a ﬁrm not founded by
any of the inventors.7
6

Duration models are designed to incorporate information on both
cases for which an event of interest has occurred and those for
which an event has not yet occurred, correcting for the effects of
censoring. Because I make no claims about the functional form of
time dependence, the Cox model offers the best approach to modeling time dependence.
7
In unreported regressions, I also examine the probability that the
licensee will be a ﬁrm founded by one of the inventors. Because
some of the patents were licensed by inventors and noninventors, the two operationalizations of the dependent variable are not
inverse. However, the results are qualitatively the same (support
the same argument at similar levels of signiﬁcance with similar
magnitudes) when the dependent variable to be predicted is license
to inventors.

The third part of the study examines the population
of 966 efforts to commercialize licensed MIT patents
between 1980 and 1996. In this analysis, I use Cox
proportional hazard duration models to examine the
effect of the interaction of patent effectiveness and
inventor-licensee on both the hazard of cancellation
of the license to the patent and the hazard of ﬁrst sale
of products and processes in which the invention is
embodied.
The fourth part of the study examines the royalties generated from the population of 167 MIT patents
commercialized between 1980 and 1997 by noninventors. In this analysis, I use Tobit regression to explore
the relationship between patent effectiveness and the
dollar value of the royalties generated from commercialized inventions.8
Dependent Variable: Licensing
To measure licensing, I examined the MIT Technology Licensing Ofﬁce (TLO) records of its licensees. I
constructed annual spells, which begin when a patent
is issued and end when a patent is ﬁrst licensed. The
variable was coded 1 if the TLO records revealed that
a patent was ﬁrst licensed in that year, 0 otherwise.
Patents that were not licensed during the observation
period were treated as censored. Of the 1,397 inventions in the sample, 51.3% were licensed.
Dependent Variables: Inventor Licensees
I examined the TLO records to identify the entity that
licensed the 717 licensed patents. The licensees were
coded “noninventor” if the entity was a ﬁrm that was
not founded by any of the inventors listed on the
patent. I predict the probability of license to noninventors.
Although inventors could become involved in
licensee ﬁrms by serving on the scientiﬁc advisory
8
Tobit regression measures the effect of independent variables on
changes in the dependent variable when the distribution of the
dependent variable is truncated. Because I wish to draw inference
about the relationship between patent effectiveness and royalties
received by MIT for a distribution in which commercialized patents
generate royalties greater than zero, Tobit regression is appropriate. However, I obtain substantively the same results with ordinary
least squares regression.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

boards or as consultants to the new ventures, I examine ﬁrm founding rather than these alternative forms
of involvement for four reasons. First, consulting and
advisory board membership do not represent the construct of entrepreneurship as deﬁned in the prior literature, whereas ﬁrm founding does. Consequently,
examining the likelihood of license to ventures not
founded by inventors allows comparison of the ﬁndings to prior literature on entrepreneurship. Second,
ﬁrm founding captures the effect of equity ownership
of new ventures. The transaction cost literature on
which I build focuses on the concept of ownership by
a single party as a solution to contracting problems.
Inventor involvement through arrangements that do
not necessarily involve equity ownership, such as scientiﬁc board membership or consulting, does not capture this core construct. Third, the empirical test that
I undertake requires the determination of inventor
involvement with the patented invention at the time
of license. Because consulting arrangements and scientiﬁc advisory board membership are often established after the time of license, their measurement in
this context is problematic. Fourth, I analyze data at
the level of the invention, not at the level of the ﬁrm.
Because consulting arrangements and scientiﬁc advisory board memberships are ﬁrm-level constructs,
they are difﬁcult to operationalize at the level of analysis at which I examine the data.
Dependent Variable: License Termination and
First Sale
After patents are licensed, the licensee can terminate the license to the patent at any time. I measure
the hazard of termination. Technology licensing ofﬁcers at MIT explain that licensees typically terminate
licenses because they cannot make the technology
work in a cost-effective manner, because their strategic plans change, because the company does not want
to continue to pay license fees, or because they have
changed the product or business that they are developing so that the intellectual property is no longer
useful.9

To measure license termination, I constructed
annual spells, which begin when a patent is ﬁrst
licensed and end when the license agreement’s coverage for a patent is terminated. The variable was
coded 1 if TLO records revealed that the license agreement coverage for a patent was terminated in that
year, 0 otherwise. Licensed patents that were not terminated during the observation period were treated
as censored. Of the 966 patent-licensing efforts in the
sample, 33.4% were terminated.
After patents are licensed, commercialization of the
invention also can occur at any time. To measure
commercialization, I constructed annual spells, which
begin when a patent was licensed and end when a
product or process using the licensed patent ﬁrst generated revenues through sale to another company. The
variable was coded 1 if the TLO records revealed that
a ﬁrst sale occurred in that year, 0 otherwise. If a
product or process using the licensed patent did not
achieve a ﬁrst sale during the observation period, the
patent was treated as censored. Of the 966 patentlicensing efforts in the sample, 20.4% were embodied
in products or processes that reached a ﬁrst sale.
Dependent Variable: Royalties
To measure royalties, I examined the dollar value
of the nonequity royalty payments made to MIT
from sales of products that employed licensed patents
through 1997 for the 167 inventions that had been
commercialized by noninventors. (Option fees, patent
maintenance fees, sublicense revenues, and one-time
fees are not included in these ﬁgures.)10 I used the
TLO records of its royalty receipts to construct this
variable. Since the royalty receipts are highly skewed,
I predict the log of the royalty ﬁgure.
Yale Measures
To measure the effectiveness of patents in a line of
business, I constructed a “patent effectiveness” scale
from the Yale Survey on innovation. In that study,
10

I focus on patents licensed to noninventors rather than on patents
licensed to inventors because MIT’s compensation from inventorlicensees is heavily reliant on equity investments. The returns from
equity investments are not directly tied to the performance of speciﬁc inventions but to the overall performance of licensees.

128

Levin et al. (1987) surveyed technology managers
from different lines of business about technological
change in their line of business.11 The respondents
served as line of business experts rather than as
company representatives, and answered a variety of
Likert-style questions about their line of business.
Their answers were averaged across respondents from
each line of business.
I matched the line of business mean scores to the
patents as follows: I used the United States Patent and
Trademark Ofﬁce’s (USPTO) concordance between
the six-digit U.S. primary patent classiﬁcation and
SIC codes to identify the primary SIC code for each
patent. I used the SIC code concordance developed
by Levin et al. (1987) to match the patent effectiveness scores to SIC codes. When the SIC code to which
the USPTO concordance mapped a patent was at
a higher level of aggregation than the SIC code to
which the Levin et al. (l987) concordance mapped the
patent effectiveness measure, I averaged the Levin
et al. (1987) patent effectiveness scores across all lines
of business corresponding to that SIC code.
Using the Yale measures to construct the patent
effectiveness variable has several important advantages for this study. First, the authors ensured reliability and validity through a pretest with respondents
from multiple businesses and through the common
identiﬁcation of major industry innovations (Levin
et al. 1987). Moreover, subsequent studies have conﬁrmed the validity and reliability of the measures
(e.g., Cohen and Levinthal 1990, Levin et al. 1985,
Klevorick et al. 1995).
Second, the Levin et al. (1987) sample was representative of research and development intensive lines
of business activity, making the sample appropriate
for this study. Moreover, by comparing their results
to data on the industries measured by the National
Science Foundation, Levin et al. (1987) conﬁrmed the
sample’s representativeness.

second items, respectively, but were responses to the
question, “In this line of business, how effective is
each of the following means of capturing and protecting the competitive advantages of new or improved
products?” The four items were measured on sevenpoint scale from 1 (not at all effective) to 7 (very effective). This scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.78.
Control Variables
Year Issued. I control for the year in which the
patent was issued because both federal law and MIT
policy have changed over time, altering incentives for
potential licensees.12
Technical Fields. The existence of commercial
opportunities and appropriability vary across technical ﬁelds (Cohen and Levin 1989), and this variation
might inﬂuence the decision of MIT inventors to disclose their inventions to the MIT TLO, and the decisions of the TLO to seek patent protection on them.
For example, patents are less effective mechanisms
for appropriating the returns to invention in semiconductor engineering than in other ﬁelds. Consequently,
researchers in semiconductor engineering might be
more likely to bypass the university patenting and
licensing process altogether, except when they have a
relationship with potential industry licensees or particularly important inventions. To mitigate this problem, I control for the technology ﬁeld in which the
12

I also examined time as the year of patent application and as a
set of dummy variables for each year of patent issue. The results
for all of the regression models presented in here are substantively
the same when the year of patent application is included instead of
year of patent issue. In addition, the use of dummy variables conﬁrmed the increasing probability of license over time in all of the
regression models. I report the year issued variable instead of the
dummy variables because it provides a more parsimonious summary of the effects of time on the likelihood of license.

invention is assigned—chemical, electrical, mechanical, drug (other is the base case). The technology ﬁeld
dummy variables will capture some of the variation
in the willingness of inventors to disclose their inventions to MIT and for MIT to seek patent protection.
Funding. Two arguments can be made for the
effect of research funding on the licensing of university inventions. The ﬁrst is that commercial ﬁrms generally fund university research in return for a right of
ﬁrst refusal to license any inventions that result from
that research. Therefore, industry-funded research
should be more likely to be licensed than research
funded by the government, foundations, or universities. The second argument is that the Bayh-Dole Act
has increased the rate of technology licensing from
universities by giving universities the property rights
to federally funded inventions. Therefore, in the postBayh–Dole era, government funded research should
be more likely to be licensed than research funded
by foundations or universities. I control for industry
and government funding with two dummy variables.
The ﬁrst takes a value of 1 if the research was funded
by industry. The second takes the value of 1 if the
government funded the research. These variables are
nonexclusive since research could receive both government and industry funding.

Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics. Table 2 provides a correlation matrix for the variables in the
initial regression analysis. Table 3 shows the results
of the Cox regression to predict licensing of the
1,397 MIT-assigned patents issued between 1980 and
1996. Table 4 provides a logistic regression to predict
whether the licensee of the 717 licensed patents was a
noninventor. Table 5 shows results of the Cox regressions to predict termination of the patent license, and
Table 6 shows the results of Cox regressions to predict ﬁrst sale of products or services embodying the
licensed patent for the 966 patent licensing efforts
between 1980 and 1996. Table 7 shows the results of
the Tobit regressions to predict the amount of royalties earned between 1980 and 1997 for the inventions
successfully commercialized by noninventors.

As Table 1 shows, 51.3% the MIT-assigned patents
were licensed at some time between 1980 and 1996.
Of the 717 licensed patents, 537 were licensed to ﬁrms
not founded by one of the inventors. The 717 licensed
patents generated 966 licensing efforts. By the end of
1996, 323 of these licensing efforts had been terminated and 197 had resulted in a ﬁrst sale. For the
197 patents that resulted in commercialization, 167
were commercialized by at least one ﬁrm not founded
by the inventors. The distribution of nonequity royalty payments on product sales from the commercialized inventions was fairly skewed. For the 167 patents
commercialized by ﬁrms not founded by inventors,
the average was $50,429.68, with a range from $11.49
to $1,516,717.77.

(ExpB = 060, p < 00001) than for other patents.
Consistent with the ﬁrst hypothesis, the likelihood of
license was higher in lines of businesses in which
patents were more effective (ExpB = 119, p < 005).
Model 3b provides a robustness check by dropping the dummy variables for technology types.
Model 3b shows results consistent with Model 3a.
Overall the model is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 17118, p <

higher for industry-funded (ExpB = 149, p < 0001)
and government-funded (ExpB = 150, p < 00001)
patents. The likelihood of license was also higher the

of businesses in which patents were more effective
(ExpB = 156, p < 00001).13
One of the potential problems with using the Yale
Survey data to measure patent effectiveness is that
two lines of business—drugs and electronic computing equipment—might drive the regression results.
For this reason, in an unreported Cox regression,
I reanalyzed the hazard of licensing for the 1,103
patents that were neither drug patents (SIC 283) nor
electronic computing equipment patents (SIC 357).

The results were qualitatively the same as the results
reported above. The overall model was signiﬁcant
( 2 = 11752, p < 00001). Moreover, patent effectiveness increases the hazard of patent license (ExpB =
145, p < 001). Thus, the results are robust to the
exclusion of two potential outlier lines of business.
Another criticism of the Yale measures is that the
effectiveness of patents across lines of business may
have changed since the Yale Survey was conducted
in 1982. Moreover, the accuracy of the semantic scale
items used to measure the effectiveness of patents in
the Yale Survey may introduce bias into the analyses. To mitigate these two criticisms, in unreported
regressions, I substitute the patent effectiveness measure from the more recent Carnegie Mellon Survey
of 1,478 R&D labs in U.S. manufacturing in 1994 for
the Yale Survey measure (Cohen et al. 2000). This
latter survey measured the effectiveness of patents
by asking “respondents to report the percentage of
their product and process innovations for which
each appropriability mechanism had been effective
in protecting the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage from
those innovations during the prior three years. The
response categories were: (1) less than 10%; (2) 10%
through 40%; (3) 41% through 60%; (4) 61% through
90%; and (5) greater than 90% (Cohen et al. 2000,
p. 5).” The responses were averaged across all ﬁrms
in each line of business.14
When I reanalyzed the data, substituting the more
recent Carnegie Mellon measures for patent effectiveness for the Yale measures, the results were qualitatively the same as the results that I report above. The
overall model was signiﬁcant ( 2 = 14402, p < 00001).
Moreover, the hazard of license was higher in lines
of businesses in which patents were more effective
(ExpB = 104, p < 00001). Therefore, the results do
not appear to be an artifact of using the Yale Survey
measures.
Table 3 raises the question: How are patents
licensed in lines of business in which patents are not
effective? Table 4 provides one answer. This table predicts the probability that the 717 licensed patents were
licensed to noninventors. Model 4a provides the base

regression. Model 4b provides a robustness check by
dropping the dummy variables for technology types.
Model 4a15 is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 2038, p < 001). The
likelihood of license to inventors was higher for chemical (ExpB = 176, p < 005) and electrical (ExpB =
247, p < 001) patents than for other patents. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, the greater the effectiveness
of patents in a line of business, the greater the likelihood of license to a ﬁrm not founded by any of the
inventors (ExpB = 194, p < 00001).
Model 4b supports the analysis in Model 4a.
Although the overall model is not signiﬁcant ( 2 =
693, p > 010), the greater the effectiveness of patents
in a line of business, the greater the likelihood of
license to a ﬁrm not founded by any of the inventors
(ExpB = 127, p < 005).
Table 5 provides models to predict the hazard that
a patent license is terminated. Model 5a provides
the base regression. Model 5b provides a robustness
check by dropping the dummy variables for technology types.
Model 5a is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 5927, p < 00001). This
model looks at the interaction of patent effectiveness
with inventor-licensee on the hazard of license termination. The hazard of termination was lower for
licensed electrical patents (ExpB = 068, p < 005)
than for other patents. The hazard of termination of
licensed patents was also higher, the newer the patent
(ExpB = 107, p < 00001). Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the hazard of termination of patents licensed
to inventor-founded ﬁrms was higher in lines of businesses in which patents were more effective (ExpB =
181, p < 0001).
Model 5b conﬁrms the results of Model 5a. Overall, the model is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 5229, p < 00001).
The hazard of termination of licensed patents was
also higher the newer the patent (ExpB = 107,

I also ran Cox regressions to predict the hazard of ﬁrst license to
inventors and to noninventors to ensure that the results were not an
artifact of censoring. The Cox regressions conﬁrmed the results of
the logistic regressions. The model to predict the hazard of licensing
to inventors was signiﬁcant, and patent effectiveness signiﬁcantly
decreased the hazard of license. The model to predict the hazard of
licensing to noninventors was signiﬁcant and patent effectiveness
signiﬁcantly increased the hazard of license.

patents licensed to inventor-founded ﬁrms was higher
in lines of businesses in which patents were more
effective (ExpB = 183, p < 0001).
Table 6 provides models to predict the hazard that a
product or process embodying the invention reaches
ﬁrst sale, conditional on the licensing of the invention. Model 6a provides the base regression. Model 6b
provides a robustness check by dropping the dummy
variables for technology types.
Model 6a is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 4128, p < 00001).
This model looks at the main effect of patent effectiveness and the interaction of patent effectiveness
with inventor-licensee on the hazard of ﬁrst sale. The
hazard of ﬁrst sale was higher for licensed chemical patents (ExpB = 174, p < 005) than for other
patents. In addition, the hazard of ﬁrst sale was
also higher for licensed government-funded patents
(ExpB = 154, p < 005) than for other patents. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, the hazard of ﬁrst sale from
patents licensed to inventor-founded ﬁrms was lower
in lines of businesses in which patents were more
effective (ExpB = 055, p < 001).
Model 6b conﬁrms the results of Model 6a. Overall,
the model is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 2950, p < 00001). The
hazard of ﬁrst sale was also higher for licensed government funded patents (ExpB = 165, p < 001) than
for other patents. Moreover, the hazard of ﬁrst sale
from patents licensed to inventor-founded ﬁrms was
lower in lines of businesses in which patents were
more effective (ExpB = 056, p < 001).
Table 7 predicts the log of royalties received by MIT
for the 167 commercialized patents that were licensed
to noninventors. Model 7a provides the base regression. Model 7b provides a robustness check by dropping the dummy variables for technology types.
Model 7a is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 3698, p < 00001). The
model shows that conditional on license to noninventors and commercialization, electrical patents earned
greater royalties by 1997 than other patents (B = 049,
p < 010). In addition, conditional on license to noninventors and commercialization, later issued patents
generated lower royalties by 1997 than earlier issued
patents (B = −006, p < 00001). Moreover, consistent
with Hypothesis 5, the effectiveness of patents in
the line of business increases the amount of royalties earned from commercialized patents licensed to
noninventors (B = 044, p < 0001).

Model 7b conﬁrms the results from Model 7a. Overall, this model is signiﬁcant ( 2 = 2568, p < 00001).
Conditional on license to noninventors and commercialization, later issued patents generated lower royalties by 1997 than earlier issued patents (B = −006,
p < 00001). Moreover, the effectiveness of patents in
the line of business increases the amount of royalties earned from commercialized patents licensed to

Discussion

This study examined the inﬂuence of patent effectiveness on the licensing of, commercialization of, and
royalty generation from the population of 1,397 MIT
inventions issued between 1980 and 1996. The results
show that inventions are more likely to be licensed
when patents are an effective mechanism for appropriating the returns to innovation because the patent
system reduces the transaction costs of technology
transfer. When patents are not an effective mechanism
for appropriating the returns to innovation, university technology is likely to be licensed back to inventors because inventor commercialization mitigates the
adverse selection, moral hazard, and hold-up problems that plague markets for knowledge.
When patents are effective, licensing to noninventors reduces the likelihood of license termination
and increases the likelihood of invention commercialization by allowing commercialization to be undertaken by economic actors who possess a comparative
16

Because I cannot conduct an experiment to test whether exogenous variation in the level of patent effectiveness inﬂuences the
mode and success of commercialization, I assume that patent effectiveness is not correlated with the unobserved “quality” of the
inventions in my analyses. I also attempt to control for invention
“quality.” In unreported regressions, I analyze the same regression
models described above, controlling for the count of forward citations to the MIT inventions. The inﬂuence of the patent effectiveness variable is qualitatively the same in the alternative regressions
that control for citations, suggesting that the effects are robust to
efforts to control for invention quality. I do not report these alternative regressions both because of space limitations and because
forward citations are an imperfect measure of patent quality. Not
only is the correlation between the ﬁnancial return from innovation and citation counts relatively low, forward patent citations may
themselves be inﬂuenced by the outcome of attempts to license the
inventions.

advantage in that activity. As a result, the effectiveness of patents in a line of business increases
the royalties earned from inventions licensed to
noninventors.
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, the
study used semantic scales that lack an objective
anchor to measure the effectiveness of patents (Levin
et al. 1987). Consequently, the respondents may have
varied signiﬁcantly in their perceptions of the types
of competitive advantages that are effective in their
industries. However, these biases are likely to be
limited by the approach used to analyze the data.
Levin et al. (1987) averaged the semantic responses
across respondents in each line of business, and
this averaging should have dampened individuallevel variation in perceptions. Moreover, there is no
a priori theoretical reason to believe that the perceptual biases of the respondents differ systematically
across industries. Furthermore, I obtain qualitatively
similar results using the more recent Carnegie Mellon survey measures for patent effectiveness, which
do not employ a semantic scale without an objective
anchor.
Second, U.S. patent classes do not map perfectly on
industry classiﬁcations, such as SIC codes. To match
patent classes to industries, I relied on the USPTO
patent–SIC concordance. Because this concordance is
imperfect, this mapping procedure introduces noise
into the data, which makes the regression estimates
imprecise. Moreover, other concordances that make
different patent class to SIC matches also exist. The
differences between the matches made by the USPTO
and other concordances may also introduce noise into
the analyses. Nevertheless, I use the USPTO concordance because no more precise mechanism currently
exist for matching patents to SIC codes.
Third, the study analyzed data from a single
research university, and technology licensing may
differ signiﬁcantly across universities. Given its
disproportionate inﬂuence on the generation of new
technology, MIT may be a special case that might limit
the generalizability of the ﬁndings shown here. Future
research should explore this issue.
134

Fourth, this study does not capture several dimensions of university inventions that may inﬂuence technology licensing. Jensen and Thursby (forthcoming)
have shown that university technology is more likely
to be licensed if it is at a later stage of development,
a dimension not measured here. Moreover, the study
does not examine the effect of social relationships
between licensing ofﬁcers, inventors, and industry
representatives, even though Shane and Cable (1998)
found that these relationships were important, particularly when start-ups or small companies licensed the
technology.
Fifth, the results shown in this article are not unconditional estimates of the hazard of licensing, but are
estimates conditional on MIT’s decision to ﬁle for a
patent.17 Only 60% of university invention disclosures
result in patent applications. If patent effectiveness
is important in obtaining a license (as the analysis
here shows), then the TLO should be more likely
to ﬁle a patent in those lines of business in which
patents are more effective. Therefore, the results presented here are conditional on MIT’s prior selection
of which invention disclosures to patent. Nevertheless, the tests presented here are conservative because
they are biased against ﬁnding an effect for the patent
effectiveness variable. If the TLO considers patent
effectiveness in the line of business in deciding which
invention disclosures to patent, then the magnitude
of the effect of the patent effectiveness variable on
licensing is understated.
Sixth, the analyses presented here are not independent of each other. If one knew with reasonable accuracy the behavior, probability distributions
over future contingencies, and expectations of decision makers in the licensing process, a dynamic structural model would be the best approach to analyzing
these data. I do not follow this approach here because
the behavioral processes underlying university technology licensing are not well enough understood to
specify such a model in a reasonable way. Readers
are therefore cautioned to exercise caution in interpreting the coefﬁcients. The results do not allow us
17

I was unable to obtain data from MIT’s invention reports. Such
data would determine if the probability of patent application was
inﬂuenced by the effectiveness of patents in a line of business.

Implications for Research Policy

Despite the limitations described above, the results
have important implications for two related areas
of research: innovation strategy and management
and technology entrepreneurship. In the subsections
below, I discuss the implications of the results for each
of these areas.
Innovation Strategy and Management
The results of this study have useful implications
for the ﬁeld of innovation strategy and management.
Many observers have noted that innovation increasingly is taking place through contractual arrangements. However, transaction cost economics explains
that contractual arrangements are not always the best
way to manage innovation (Pisano and Mang 1993).
This study provides some empirical evidence about
this process, albeit in the specialized case of university inventions. The data show that when patents are
effective, licensing by noninventors is more likely to
result in commercialization than is licensing back to
inventors. As a result, this study provides empirical evidence in answer to the question: When should
innovation be internalized and when should it be contracted out?
In addition, the results provide insight into Schumpeterian dynamics in high technology industries.
Many researchers have argued that when the locus of
innovation lies outside of incumbent ﬁrms, the development of new technology spurs a process of creative destruction through which innovators replace
incumbent ﬁrms (Christiansen and Bower 1994, Foster
1986). However, in many high technology industries,
like biotechnology, this external locus of innovation
does not result in creative destruction (Gans and
Stern 2000).18
Gans and Stern (2000) have argued that one reason
for the between industry variation in the tendency
18

For example, most new biotechnology products have been based
on discoveries made by entities other than research and development units of major pharmaceutical ﬁrms (Gans et al. 2000).

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

of incumbents to withstand external innovation lies
in the effectiveness of markets for knowledge. Where
markets for knowledge are effective, nonincumbent
innovators can license their technologies to established ﬁrms. This process allows external innovators to earn returns to innovation without competing
with incumbents in product markets. This study provides support for the core assumption of Gans and
Stern’s (2000) argument. When patents are ineffective,
(university) inventors are more likely to found ﬁrms
to commercialize their inventions. In contrast, when
patents are effective, (university) inventors are more
likely to license their inventions to noninventors.
Finally, the results of this study are consistent with
Anand and Khanna’s (2000) argument that technology licensing can be explained largely on the basis of
industry differences in patent strength. Their explanation has the advantage of parsimony over many
alternative explanations for licensing because it does
not require assumptions about the importance of the
technology being transferred, demand conditions, or
market structure.
Technology Entrepreneurship
The results of this study also have useful implications for the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship. The
results provide evidence that university inventors
become entrepreneurs because of failures in the
market for knowledge, suggesting that inventorentrepreneurship is a second-best solution to the
commercialization of new technology. This view
stands in contrast to the perspective of most of the
entrepreneurship literature (and the popular press),
which argues that independent entrepreneurship is
a better mechanism for university technology commercialization than commercialization by established
ﬁrms. This difference is important because theories
in which independent entrepreneurship is considered
the best approach to technology commercialization
yield different implications from theories in which
independent entrepreneurship is considered a secondbest approach.
Moreover, the results of this study support a
small literature that argues that who becomes an
entrepreneur depends more on information and
opportunities than on the psychological attributes

of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs (Shane and
Venkataraman 2000, Shane 2000). Traditionally,
entrepreneurship research has argued that ﬁrm formation occurs because certain people possess special attributes (e.g., tolerance of uncertainty, need for
achievement, locus of control) that make them better able than others to undertake the entrepreneurial
process (Khilstrom and Laffont 1979, McClelland
1961). In contrast to the personological perspective
on entrepreneurship, this study shows that the nature
of technological opportunities themselves inﬂuence
whether opportunities will be sold to others or
exploited by inventor-entrepreneurs.
Conclusion
This paper draws on transaction cost economics
to show that (1) university inventions are more
likely to be licensed when patents are effective;
(2) when patents are not effective, university technology tends to be licensed back to inventors;
(3) when patents are effective, licensing to noninventors reduces the likelihood of license termination and
increases the likelihood of invention commercialization; and (4) the effectiveness of patents increases royalties earned for inventions licensed to noninventors.
Hopefully, this study will spur future researchers to
consider the inﬂuence of appropriability on university
technology licensing.
