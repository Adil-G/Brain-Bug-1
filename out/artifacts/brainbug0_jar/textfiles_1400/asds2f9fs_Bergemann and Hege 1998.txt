Abstract
We consider the provision of venture capital in a dynamic agency model. The value
of the venture project is initially uncertain and more information arrives by developing
the project. The allocation of the funds and the learning process are subject to moral
hazard. The optimal contract is a time-varying share contract which provides intertemporal risk-sharing between venture capitalist and entrepreneur. The share of the entrepreneur re¯ects the value of a real option. The option itself is based on the control of the
funds. The dynamic agency costs may be high and lead to an inecient early stopping of
the project. A positive liquidation value explains the adoption of strip ®nancing or convertible securities. Finally, relationship ®nancing, including monitoring and the occasional replacement of the management improves the eciency of the ®nancial
contracting. Ó 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
1.1. Motivation
Venture capital has become a major vehicle for the funding of start-up ®rms.
In many countries, most notably the United States, venture capital is now the
®nancing mode of choice for projects where ``learning'' and ``innovation'' are
important. Because of their innovative nature, venture projects carry a substantial risk of failure. Only a minority of start-ups are high-return investments: 20% or less are frequent estimates for the fraction of projects where
investors can successfully ``cash out'', mostly through IPO's. Of the remaining,
a majority is sold o privately or merged which can mean anything between a
modest success and scantly disguised failure with substantial losses. A minority
is liquidated implying a complete write-o of the investment. 1
One of the most challenging problems in venture ®nancing is to determine
when to release funds for continued development and when to abandon a project. Many aspects of the venture capital industry suggest that practitioners are
well aware that they face a sequence of starting and stopping problems in the
®nancing of a venture. 2 An essential feature of any venture project is the necessity to fund the project in order to learn more about the uncertain return of
the venture. This process often starts with the provision of seed ®nancing to set
up a business plan. The simultaneity of the ®nancing decision and the acquisition of information about the investment project is characteristic for ventures
and more generally for the ®nancing of innovation. Surprisingly, the dynamic
interaction of both aspects has received little attention in the literature.
This paper proposes a simple model to analyze the optimal ®nancing of venture projects when learning and moral hazard interact. A wealth constrained
entrepreneur oers an investment opportunity to a venture capitalist. The project can either succeed or fail. The successful completion requires funds for the
development of the project. The rate of investment controls the probability of
success. A higher investment level accelerates the process of discovery. As the
project continues to receive ®nancing without achieving success, the agents
change their assessment about the likelihood of future success. Eventually
the prospects may become too poor to warrant further investment.
The entrepreneur controls the allocation of the funds and the investment
eort is unobservable to the investor. The control over the funds implies that
the entrepreneur also controls the ¯ow of information about the project. The

The staging of the funds, documented in Lerner (1994) and Gompers (1995) is perhaps the most
prominent aspect of the sequential nature of venture ®nancing.

solution of the agency con¯ict has to take into account the intertemporal incentives for the entrepreneur. Suppose, in any given period, the entrepreneur
would consider to divert the capital ¯ow for her private consumption. In the
following period she would then be marginally more optimistic about the future of the project than the venture capitalist. The entrepreneur would know
that the project did not receive any capital in the preceding period and hence
could not possibly generate a success. But the venture capitalist would continue
to believe that the entrepreneur did as instructed. In consequence he interprets
the fact that no success has been observed as ``bad news'' about the project.
Following a deviation, the entrepreneur will therefore keep her posterior belief
about future success constant while the posterior belief of the investor is necessarily downgraded. The reward for the entrepreneur therefore consists of
two components. She needs to be compensated for the foregone private bene®ts
but also for the downgrading of her expectations about the future of the project. The longer the experimentation horizon, the larger is the option value of
the diversion. In fact, the compensation could become so large as to surpass the
net value of the project. In turn this implies the possibility of ®nancial constraints in the form of an inecient and premature end of the project.
1.2. Results and empirical implications
The optimal share contract and the ®nancial constraints allow for a number
of empirical implications.
First, our paper provides an analysis of the optimal evolution of the shares
of entrepreneur and venture capitalist. How the parties should optimally split
the prize should depend on the funding horizon and the ¯ow of funds. Our
model predicts that the share of the entrepreneur decreases towards the end.
Initially, the entrepreneur's share can rise or fall, depending on the discount
rate and the degree of initial optimism. The expected share of the entrepreneur,
however, always decreases over time. Similarly, the expected return of the venture capitalist decreases over time and he may even make losses if the project
approaches the stopping time. Empirical ®ndings indicate that the entrepreneur
is indeed penalized if the project takes too much time as her equity fraction is
diluted from ®nancing round to ®nancing round. 3
Second, we obtain results for the security design by extending the model to
positive liquidation values in case of abandonment. The liquidation value is received by selling tangible assets or intermediate results. The venture capitalist
should then either receive strip packages combining common stock and debt or
convertible securities. The optimal contract should reward the entrepreneur

3
As new funds are provided in exchange with stock purchase agreements, the shares of the
entrepreneur become diluted, see e.g. Sahlman (1990), Lerner (1995) and Gompers (1995).

<-----Page 3----->706

only in the case of success. The venture capitalist should therefore keep a
``hard'' claim in case of failure. However, if the venture capitalist would hold
exclusively hard claims, then a premature liquidation is likely. 4
Third, a pure share or equity contract could be ®nanced at arm's length, implying that it could be traded in ®nancial markets. However an arm's length
share contract may leave too much surplus to the entrepreneur and the project
would be terminated too early. Our model accounts thus naturally for the observation that venture ®nancing is typically relationship ®nancing. Costly monitoring and the option to replace the entrepreneur may become desirable.
Relationship speci®c ®nancing permits the extension of the funding horizon. 5
Fourth, short-term re®nancing of the project can never be optimal. We call
short-term ®nancing, as distinct from staged ®nancing, a ®nancial policy where
the entrepreneur attracts funds on a competitive basis in each period. Towards
the end of the ecient investment horizon, the expected return is insucient to
cover the necessary outlays for both partners. The ecient solution can only be
achieved by a long-term contract which allows for intertemporal risk-sharing.
More precisely, the venture capitalist subsidizes continuation of the project toward the end in exchange for higher expected pro®ts at the beginning. Consistent with this result, Sahlman (1990) observes that venture capitalists are
protected against competition by preemptive rights and Anand and Galetovic
(1997) report that venture ®nancing is frequently supported by long-term relationships.
We may ®nally remark that up-front ®nancing as well as staged ®nancing
are consistent with our model. Since the optimal contract satis®es the intertemporal incentive constraints, the funds will be allocated by the entrepreneur as
intended regardless of how the funds are provided over time. 6 In Section 7
we discuss the extension of the model to multiple signals, where stage ®nancing
arises as the unique optimal ®nancial arrangement.
1.3. Related literature and overview
The theoretical research on venture ®nance has only recently emerged. In
Hart and Moore (1994), the option of the entrepreneur to repudiate her ®nancial obligations limits the feasible amount of outsider claims. Neher (1997) extends their approach to stage ®nancing as an instrument to implement the
optimal investment path. Admati and P¯eiderer (1994) show that a ®xed

fraction equity contract may give robust optimal incentives if it is ecient to
allocate the control rights to the venture capitalist. BergloÈf (1994) considers
convertible debt in a framework of incomplete contracts to transfer control
rights to the value-maximizing party. Chan et al. (1990) explain the optimal
transition of control between entrepreneur and venture capitalist in a model
with initial uncertainty about the skill of the entrepreneur. Hellmann (1996) explains the willingness of the entrepreneur to relinquish control rights by a
trade-o between equity and debt induced incentives. Trester (1998) argues
that the problem of an entrepreneur dissipating the ®rm's assets can be mitigated if the investor has no option to declare default and seize the assets. Cornelli
and Yosha (1997) analyze the problem of an entrepreneur manipulating shortterm results for purposes of ``window-dressing''.
The paper is organized as follows. The model is presented in Section 2. The
value of the project is characterized in Section 3. The structure and eciency of
short and long-term contracting is examined in Section 4. We extend the model
in Section 5 by allowing for a positive liquidation value of the project and discuss issues of security design in this context. In Section 6, we analyze the relationship speci®c instruments such as monitoring and the occasional
replacement of the entrepreneur. Section 7 discusses possible extensions of
the model. Section 8 concludes.
2. The model
The venture is presented as an investment project with uncertain returns in
Section 2.1. The successful realization of the venture is positively correlated
with the volume of ®nancing it receives. As the ¯ow of investment sinks into
the project, entrepreneur and investor update their assessment of the prospects
of the project. The evolution of the posterior belief of eventual success represents the learning process of the agents, which is analyzed in Section 2.2. The
moral hazard problem between the entrepreneur and the investor as well as
the ®nancing possibilities of the project are ®nally described in Section 2.3.
2.1. Project with uncertain returns
An entrepreneur owns a project with uncertain return. The project is either
``good'' with prior probability a0 or ``bad'' with prior probability 1 ÿ a0 . If
the project is ``good'', then in every period t, there is a certain probability that
the project is successfully completed, in which case it yields a ®xed payo R. The
probability of success in period t, conditional on the project being good, is denoted by pt . The probability pt is in turn an increasing function of the investment
¯ow in period t. Or inversely, a success probability pt requires an investment
¯ow of cpt  in period t. We assume that cpt  is a linear function of pt :

<-----Page 5----->708

D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

cpt   cpt ;

c > 0:

1

The maximal probability of success in each period is denoted by p (without any
subscript), where 0 < p < 1 and any probability pt 2 0; p is feasible in each
period. In other words, any investment beyond c p does not increase the probability of success.
If the project is ``bad'', then it will never yield a return and the probability of
success is zero independent of the capital ¯ow. The project can receive ®nancing over any number of periods and time is discrete and denoted by
t  0; 1; . . . ; T : The investment process either stops with a successful completion or the project is eventually abandoned when the likelihood of future success becomes suciently small.
The uncertainty of the project is resolved over time by an experimentation
process, where the likelihood of success is positively correlated with the investment in the project. The investment problem is simple as the investment only
in¯uences the conditional probability of success in every period and independent of time. In particular, the investment ¯ow does not in¯uence the value
of the successful realization, R, or the scrap value if the project should be abandoned. In Section 7 we shall discuss how these modi®cations, as well as time
dependent probabilities, would enrich the predictions of our model.
2.2. Learning
As the experimentation process develops over time, entrepreneur and investor learn more about the prospects of the project. If success has not yet occurred at period t, then the participants in the project update their beliefs
about the type of the project. We next determine the evolution of the posterior
beliefs. We denote by at1 the posterior belief that the project is good, based on
no discovery until and including t. The evolution of the posterior belief at1 ;
conditional on no success, is given by Bayes' rule as a function of the prior belief at and the capital ¯ow cpt as:
at 1 ÿ pt 
:
2
at 1 ÿ pt   1 ÿ at
The posterior belief at1 thus decreases over time when success has not been realized. The decline in the posterior belief is stronger for larger investments, as
the participants in the venture become more pessimistic about the likelihood of
success. The posterior belief, again conditional on no success yet, can be represented as a function of the initial belief a0 and the sequence of investments
until t; fcp0 ; cp1 ; . . . ; cpt g:

The evolution of the posterior belief, conditional on no success, under two different constant allocation policies is displayed in Fig. 1.
The posterior belief changes only slowly if the participants have very precise
beliefs about the nature of the project, i.e. if at is close to either 0 or 1. Correspondingly the event of no success is most informative if the agents have very
diuse beliefs, i.e. at is close to 12. In this case the posterior beliefs change most
rapidly. In any case, a higher investment level accelerates the rate at which the
posteriors change over time as displayed in Fig. 1.
2.3. Moral hazard and ®nancing
The entrepreneur has no wealth initially and seeks to obtain external funds
to realize the project. Financing is available from a competitive market of

venture capitalists. Entrepreneur and venture capitalists have initially the same
assessment about the likelihood of success, which is given by the prior belief a0 .
The entrepreneur and venture capitalists are both risk-neutral and have a common discount factor d 2 0; 1.
The funds which are supplied by the venture capitalist are to be allocated by
the entrepreneur to generate the desired success R. However the (correct) allocation of the funds to the project is unobservable to the venture capitalist, and
thus a moral hazard problem arises between ®nancier and entrepreneur. Indeed
the entrepreneur can ``shirk'' and decide to (partially) withhold the investment
and divert the capital ¯ow to her private ends. An equivalent, but perhaps
more classical formulation of the same moral hazard problem is following
one: the ecient application of the investment requires eort, which is costly
for the entrepreneur. By reducing the eort, the entrepreneur also reduces
the probability of success and hence the eciency of the employed capital.
In both cases, a con¯ict of interest arises about the use of the funds.
Initially, the entrepreneur can suggest ®nancial contracts to any of the venture capitalists. The selected venture capitalist then decides whether to accept
or reject. The contract can be contingent on time, outcome and the capital provided by the investor. However, due to the moral hazard nature of the ®nancing problem, the contract cannot be made contingent on the (correct)
application of the funds. The design of the contract has to ensure that incentive
compatibility and individual participation constraints are satis®ed. The contract may contain a clause prohibiting that the entrepreneur continues the project once the contract has expired, for example by transferring ownership of the
idea to the venture capitalist. If such a prohibition is not made, then the entrepreneur can again suggest ®nancial contracts to any of the venture capitalists.
For the moment, we abstractly consider contingent contracts, but in the appropriate places, we shall discuss which standard securities will be able to perform
the tasks of the contingent contracts. We neglect renegotiation of contracts
throughout this paper. 7
Finally, we wish to emphasize that while there is no initial asymmetry in the
information between ®nancier and entrepreneur, the asymmetry may arise over
time as the project receives funding. The source of the asymmetry is the unobservability of the allocation of funds. If entrepreneur and investor have different assessments over how the funds have been employed, then in turn they
will have dierent posterior probabilities over the likelihood of success. Before
we consider the optimal ®nancial contract between entrepreneur and investor,
we ®rst analyze the ecient investment policy in the absence of the moral hazard problem.

3. Value of the venture
The social value of the venture project with prior belief a0 is maximized by
an optimal investment policy and an optimal stopping point. At the stopping
point the project is abandoned and no further investment is undertaken. The
stopping point itself can either be characterized by the posterior belief aT at
the stopping point or the real time T at which the project is abandoned. For
any given investment policy fcp0 ; . . . ; cpT g there is naturally a one-to-one relation between aT and T through Bayes' rule as developed in Eq. (3).
We denote by V at  the value of the project with posterior belief at under
optimal policies. The optimal policies can be obtained by standard dynamic
programming arguments. Consider ®rst the optimal stopping point aT . Clearly,
the project should receive funds as long as the expected returns from the investment exceed the costs, or
aT pT R ÿ cpT P 0;

5

for some pT 2 0; p. Conversely, if the current expected returns do not exceed
the investment cost, or
aT pT R ÿ cpT < 0;

6

then it is optimal to abandon the project, as future returns will only decline further. It follows from Eqs. (5) and (6) that the ecient boundary point a between the investment region and the stopping region is given by
c
7
a pT R ÿ cpT  0 () a  :
R
The posterior belief a at which stopping occurs decreases when either the return R increases or the marginal cost c of generating success decreases.
We notice next that if indeed the last investment occurs at aT , then it is optimal to choose pT  p due to the linear structure of the problem. Hence we obtain the value in the terminal period:
V aT   aT pR ÿ cp:

8

The value of the venture is then obtained recursively by the dynamic programming equation:
V at   maxfat pt R ÿ cpt  1 ÿ at pt dV at1 g;
pt

9

where the posterior belief at1 is determined by the incoming belief at and the
investment cpt in period t through Bayes' rule as expressed in Eq. (2). The value
function (9) represents the implications of an investment policy cpt on current
and future returns. An increase in cpt is costly but it increases the probability of
a successful completion today and the associated expected returns at pt R. At the
same time, it becomes less likely that the project will have to be continued tomorrow as 1 ÿ at pt decreases. Finally, if success should not occur in period t

<-----Page 9----->712

D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

even with large investment ¯ow cpt , then the posterior belief at1 will decrease
and correspondingly the continuation value of the project, V at1 .
The value function (9) also indicates that the linearity in pT which the terminal period problem (5) displays, is preserved in the intertemporal investment
problem (9) as well. The optimal policy is therefore to invest maximally at
the level of cp as long as the posterior belief is above a and stop as soon
the posterior belief falls for the ®rst time below the boundary point a . For
transparency, we may translate this policy into a stopping time policy T  in real
time. In this case we ask how long can we maximally invest cp and still maintain posterior beliefs above the stopping point a . The optimal stopping time
T  is then given by

Evidently, the optimal stopping time T  depends on the initial belief a0 at which
the project is started, T  , T  a0 , but we usually suppress the dependence on
a0 as a matter of convenience. The stopping time T  then represents the time
elapsed between starting at a0 and arriving for the last time at a posterior belief
exceeding a : The socially ecient investment policy and the value of the venture can then be obtained from the solution of the recursive problem (9):
Proposition 1 (Optimal investment policy).

The value function V a0  presents an intuitive decomposition of the value of
the project. 8 The ®rst term in Eq. (11) is the expected value of the project conditional on the project being good. Notice that the value of the project is discounted at a rate which compounds the pure discount rate d and the
probability of no discovery 1 ÿ p which results in the factor d1 ÿ p. The second term captures the case that the project is bad which occurs with probability

in the background, we next turn to the ®nancial contracting between entrepreneur and venture capitalist.
4. Financial contracting
We begin in Section 4.1 by analyzing the provision of venture capital under
short-term contracts. The optimal short-term contracts are simple share contracts between entrepreneur and investor. However as a relationship governed
by short-term contracts has almost no scope for intertemporal transfers, shortterm contracts are generally inecient and will lead to a premature end of the
venture. Consequently, we investigate in Section 4.2 the structure of long-term
contracts and in Section 4.3 their eciency properties. The model is extended
in Section 5 to allow for a positive liquidation value of the project and issues of
security design appear in this context.
4.1. Short-term contracts
The venture capitalist oers his funds for the project in exchange against a
share of the uncertain returns of the venture. Evidently the expected returns
for the venture capitalist must be large enough to justify his investment. At
the same time, the entrepreneur must have sucient incentives to truthfully invest the funds in the project. As the project can only be successfully completed
and yield R if the entrepreneur applies the funds correctly, it follows that the
incentives provided to the entrepreneur should maximally discriminate with
respect to the signal R. With the wealth constraint of the entrepreneur, the
most high-powered incentive contract is obviously the following: she receives
a positive share of R if the project was a success and nothing otherwise. Due
to the binary nature of the project, success or failure, these contracts, which
we call share contracts, form indeed the class of optimal contracts in this environment.
De®ne by St the share of the entrepreneur if R is realized in period t. The
corresponding share of the venture capitalist is 1 ÿ St . In a short-term contract, the venture capitalist only promises to provide funds for a single period,
and then reconsiders ®nancing in the subsequent periods. The expected return
from the current investment must at least exceed the cost of the investment and
since there is competition among the venture capitalists, in equilibrium the venture capitalist will just break even. Hence the short-term contract must satisfy
for any level of funding cpt the following participation constraint:
at pt 1 ÿ St R  cpt :

12

On the other hand, the remaining share St for the entrepreneur has to be large
enough for her to invest the funds in the project and not divert them to her

<-----Page 11----->714

private ends. This forms the incentive compatibility constraint for the entrepreneur, which is formally stated by
at pt St R P cpt :

13

By combining Eqs. (12) and (13) we infer that any ®nancing under short-term
contracts can only be continued as long as the inequality
at pt R P 2cpt

14
s

is satis®ed. The critical value of the posterior belief, denoted by a , where shortterm contracting will cease is thus given by
2c
:
R
By comparing as with the socially ecient stopping point a obtained in the
previous section, we immediately obtain the following Proposition.
as 

Proposition 2 (Short-term ®nancing). The venture project is stopped prematurely
under short-term ®nancing as as > a .
The premature stopping indicated by as > a is naturally equivalent to a
funding horizon T s which is shorter than the ecient horizon T  , where T s is
determined as T  in Eq. (10). This is a simple, but important benchmark result.
It indicates that ecient ®nancing requires some form of intertemporal risk
sharing which can only be sustained by commitments made through long-term
contracts. The necessity of intertemporal risk sharing is easy to grasp. As the
posterior belief at deteriorates over time, the expected value which the parties
expect to split decreases as well. Eventually, the competing claims emanating
from the investment problem of the ®nancier Eq. (12) and the agency problem
of the entrepreneur Eq. (13) lead to a con¯ict. In this respect, ®nancing a venture resembles a team problem where both investor and entrepreneur contribute. The venture capitalist must earn the equivalent of cpt to justify his
investment, while the entrepreneur must earn the equivalent of cpt if she were
to employ the funds towards the proper end. As at decreases these compensations eventually cannot be covered anymore from the expected proceeds in period t and it follows that short-term contracts will necessarily terminate too
early.
4.2. Long-term contracts
In a regime of short-term ®nancing the investor has to break even in every
period as there was no commitment on either side to continue the relationship.
Long-term contracts can improve the intertemporal risk-sharing by replacing
the sequence of participations constraints (12) for every period by a single intertemporal participation constraint, which covers the entire funding horizon.

<-----Page 12----->D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

715

By oering the investor a larger share of the return in the early stages of the
®nancing, his shares in the later stage can be lowered, and hence the project can
be continued beyond as . But a long-term contract with the associated funding
commitments oers the entrepreneur a rich set of alternative actions, many of
them not desirable from the investor's point of view. For example, if the entrepreneur is promised additional funding in the next period, then she may consider to divert the funds today and bet instead on a positive realization of
the project tomorrow. By implication, the incentives for the entrepreneur today
have to be suciently strong, in particular relative to the incentives oered tomorrow. These dynamic considerations then generate a rich set of predictions
about the sharing rules over time. In a ®rst step we ask what the minimal share
of the entrepreneur has to be for her to truthfully apply any given sequence of
funds to the project. The second step identi®es the incentive compatible funding
policy which maximizes the value for the entrepreneur and hence is adopted in
equilibrium.
The solution to the minimization problem is, again, obtained explicitly by
dynamic programming methods. Consider ®rst the ®nal period of the contract,
denoted by T : The share ST has to be high enough for her to invest the funds in
the project rather than to divert them, or formally ST has to satisfy:
min aT pT ST R P cpT :

15

and the expected value of this arrangement to the entrepreneur is denoted by

The inequality Eq. (18) requires that for a given allocation of funds cpt , the share
St has to be large enough to prevent any diversion of funds. The diversion of
funds, represented by p0 < pt , aects the payos for the entrepreneur in two
ways. Consider ®rst the contemporaneous eect. The likelihood of success today
will be smaller as p0 < pt , but the entrepreneur enjoys the utility from the diverted funds cpt ÿ p0 . The second and dynamic eect is that a continuation of the
contract in the next period becomes more likely. And as less funds are applied to
the project today, there is less reason to change the posterior belief and clearly:

1 ÿ at p
After all, the event of no success should not surprise and lead to a smaller
change in the posterior belief as less resources have been devoted to the project.
In consequence, the entrepreneur will be more optimistic about future success
as she has seen (and provided) less evidence against it, and naturally the continuation value will be higher with more optimistic beliefs:
ÿ 
a0 > at1 () ET a0 > ET at1 :
If the entrepreneur were to withhold the funds, the private belief a0 would diverge from the public belief at1 , and to fend o the informational asymmetry,
the entrepreneur is granted an informational rent. The source of the rent is the
control over the conditional probability pt and through it over the learning process, and we shall refer to it as the learning rent.
It is now apparent that there are two forces which help to realign the interest
of the entrepreneur with the ones of the investor. First, a larger share St if success occurs today relative to the share St1 if success occurs tomorrow. Second,
the discounting of future returns at the rate d depresses the incentives of the
entrepreneur to postpone the successful realization of the project. In consequence, the more myopic the entrepreneur is, the less binding are the intertemporal incentive constraints.
The solution St of the minimization problem represented by (17) and (18) delivers the expected value ET at  the entrepreneur receives for a given funding
policy, where ET at  satis®es the recursive equation:

In the ®rst step, we were concerned with the minimal share the entrepreneur
has to receive for any given level of funding. In the next step we ask how
and when the funds should be released so as to maximize the value of the venture. As the market for venture capital is competitive, in equilibrium the net
value of the project will belong entirely to the entrepreneur. Formally, the
problem is then given by

The constraint (21) incorporates the sequence of incentive constraints through
ET a0  and the participation of the investor by requiring non-negative pro®ts in
form of the inequality. The preceding analysis provides the important hints on
the solution of Eqs. (20) and (21) as well. Consider any aggregate investment
the investor would like to contribute to the project and the remaining issue
is only how the funds should be distributed over time. If the funds are invested
only slowly into the project, then the funding commitment necessarily extends
over a longer horizon and the investor faces more intertemporal incentive constraints. These constraints increase the share of the entrepreneur and hence decrease the investor's share. Thus the optimal solution is to invest in each period
up to the ecient level cp. The complete solution of St and ET at  based on the
programs (20) and (21) is summarized as follows.

The intertemporal contract St ensures that the entrepreneur employs the
capital in every period towards the discovery process. The three elements in
the share contract as displayed in Eq. (23) may seem rather inaccessible at ®rst,
but can be decomposed and traced to the dierent aspects of the agency problem, namely i static agency costs, ii intertemporal agency costs, and iii informational agency costs.

The new aspect in the intertemporal agency problem is the option to withhold
®nancing for a single period, but continue afterwards as instructed until T. To
prevent the delay in any period, the investor has to provide stronger incentives.
The higher additional compensation is necessary as the deadline T, at which
funding is stopped is relatively remote. As the deadline comes closer, or
T ÿ t is decreasing, the need for additional incentives becomes weaker. Notice
also that the Eq. (25) only depends on the ``time to go'' and is independent of
the posterior belief at .
iii Finally the informational agency costs are represented by

which forms the basis for the learning rent of the entrepreneur. It depends on
the value of the current beliefs and the rate p at which updating of the posterior
beliefs occurs relative to the rate of discounting d. The rate of updating p is the
quantity of information the entrepreneur controls at each instant of time. The
informational rent is hence increasing in the quantity of information under in¯uence of the entrepreneur, but dampened by discounting, as the value of information today is larger than tomorrow. The three elements Eqs. (24)±(26)
together determine the share of the entrepreneur. An illustration of the decomposition of the sharing rule is given in Fig. 2.
The behavior of the shares St over time is thus determined by an underlying
option problem. The reward implied by the shares St has to be equal to the value of the option of diverting funds for a single period. The value of this particular option is determined as any regular option by the volatility of the
underlying state variable and the time over which the option can be exercised.
Here, the volatility is the conditional probability p at which updating occurs
and the time of the option right is the remaining length of the funding, T ÿ t.
The optimal (arm's length) contract is hence a time-varying share or equity
contract. The time-varying share contract presents the solution to a real option
problem, where the real option is the control of information in every period.
Some implications for the intertemporal sharing of the returns are recorded
next:
Proposition 4 (Evolution of shares over time).
i St has at most one interior extremum in t and then it is a maximum.
ii For d suciently close to 1, St is monotonically decreasing.

Fig. 2. Evolution of the share S(t) over time and decomposition.

Earlier in this section we identi®ed two elements which provide incentives to
allocate the funds truthfully in period t: a decreasing shares over time and b
suciently strong discounting. Proposition 4 identi®es the interplay between
these two forces. If discounting does not work because the remaining time horizon is too short i or discounting is too weak ii, then the shares have to fall
over time. On the other hand, the shares of the entrepreneur can only increase
initially i, when discounting (due to the length of the funding horizon T^) is
suciently strong to insure incentive compatibility.
4.3. Equilibrium and ineciency
The ecient funding policy and the associated value ET a0  to the entrepreneur for any given funding horizon T is identi®ed in Proposition 3. The ®nal
question is to what horizon the venture capitalist is willing to extend his commitment and whether the ecient horizon T  can be attained. The entrepreneur
participates in the project until T if the expected net value of the project exceeds the expected value the entrepreneur receives, as represented by the inequality Eq. (21): VT a0  P ET a0 : The ecient horizon T  can be achieved
if at T  we have

VT  a0  P ET  a0 :

27

The equilibrium contract and the implied funding horizon is determined with
the assistance of Proposition 3 and the participation constraint (21) of the investor. We have to distinguish two cases. If the project is not suciently rich to
be continued until T  , or in other words if
VT  a0  < ET  a0 ;
then the funding horizon is determined by T^, where T^ is the largest time horizon for which the value of the project exceeds the value of the compensation
for the entrepreneur
T^  max fT  1jVT a0  > ET a0 g:

28

In the second case, the project is suciently rich to allow for an ecient ®nancing, or formally:
VT  a0  P ET  a0 ;

29


in which case funding is extended until T . In equilibrium, the net value of the
project has to be allocated completely to the entrepreneur, or
VT^a0   ET^a0 ;
due to competition among the venture capitalists. Hence if the inequality holds
strictly in either Eqs. (28) and (29), then the remaining surplus has to be given
to the entrepreneur in a way compatible with the incentive constraints. In the
case of Eq. (28) this can be achieved by a one period continuation as a ``winding-down'' phase, where ST^ is determined as in Proposition 3 but with a smaller
capital ¯ow cpT^ < cp, as cp itself would violate the participation constraint of
the investor by de®nition of T^. In the case of Eq. (29), the project is rich enough to guarantee the entrepreneur a larger share than the one determined
by St in Proposition 2. But as these shares also have to satisfy the sequence
of incentive constraints, their intertemporal behavior will be similar to St .
The eciency properties of the long-term contracting are summarized in the
following proposition.
Proposition 5 (Ineciency).
i Long-term contracts allow for an extended funding horizon T^ (relative to
short-term ®nancing), but never exceed T  :
ii The funding horizon T^ of the optimal long-term contracts may not attain T  .
iii The funding horizon T^ increases in R and a0 and decreases in c.
Proof. See Appendix A.



As the funding horizon T^ increases with improved conditions for the project,
one may wonder whether the ineciency indicated in Proposition 5 ii will

<-----Page 18----->D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

721

eventually disappear entirely. The answer here is rather subtle. As, to take one
example, the return R increases, T^ increases but so does T  . Eventually T  may
become so large that the informational rent of the entrepreneur becomes too
large and the project will have to be stopped at some T^ < T  . The example
in Fig. 3 illustrates that better projects (with larger R) will indeed receive longer
funding commitments as Proposition 5 predicts, but the equilibrium allocation
may never attain social eciency.
5. Liquidation value and security design
In this section, we introduce a liquidation value of Lt > 0, which is collected
whenever the project ends without having succeeded. The value Lt represents
intermediate outcomes of the venture and captures the proceeds from selling
the remaining tangible assets if the project is liquidated. The value Lt is a deterministic function of time and does not depend on the behavior of the entrepreneur. We assume that Lt P dLt1 for all t. The liquidation value hence
contains no information about the actions of the entrepreneur. It is meant to

Fig. 3. Return R and duration of ®nancing T.

<-----Page 19----->722

D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

represent the value created by veri®able actions. The condition on the growth
of Lt merely ensures that the project is not continued without the entrepreneur. 9
The liquidation value enhances the social value of the project. If the project
is supposed to be liquidated in T, then the expected net present value is
1 ÿ a0  a0 1 ÿ pT dT LT , which is the probability to reach T multiplied by
the discounted value in T. The optimal contract should award the liquidation
payo so as to relax the ®nancial constraint on the funding horizon T^. The idea
of the optimal share contract under limited liability is to reward the entrepreneur if and only if she was successful. But a pure equity contract would give the
entrepreneur a part of the liquidation value. This necessarily weakens the incentive structure, as by diverting funds, she would increase the likelihood of
reaching the ®nal period T, and with it an additional payo ST LT . The optimal
contract therefore needs to split the claims in the case of success from the ones
in the case of liquidation. A pure equity contract cannot achieve this and a mixture between debt and common equity, or a convertible security become necessary.
De®ne a debt contract as a pro®le of debt claims Dt P 0, which are puttable
at any time t and bear no coupon. Similarly, a time-varying common stock contract is denoted by a pro®le of fractions At P 0 of total equity that the entrepreneur receives if the project is terminated in t (successfully or unsuccessfully).
The optimal ®nancial contract can then be achieved by a mixture of debt
and common equity, or a convertible security.
Proposition 6 (Security design).
i An optimal contract is provided by a mixture of debt and common equity

also represents an optimal contract.
Proof. See Appendix A.



In ``strip ®nancing'' the venture capitalist retains equity and debt, and the
debt claim increases at the rate r, where 1=1  r  d, until DT reaches LT .
The incentive compatible equity share At of the entrepreneur, which would
be St if indeed R would be distributed, has to be increased to account for the
seniority claim of Dt on R in the case of success. An equivalent distribution

723

of the pay-os can be achieved by a convertible preferred stock, as indicated by
Proposition 6ii. The time-varying conversion price is given by Dt =1 ÿ St : 10
Interestingly, there is some empirical evidence that debt becomes more important as a ®nancing tool towards later stages of venture projects. 11 In our
model debt has a function only at the termination date and this might provide
an element to understand this pattern in the dynamic capital structure in venture ®nancing. The preceding discussion already indicated that in many situations a pure sharing contract cannot be optimal. The corollary presents precise
conditions.
Corollary 1. A common stock contract At does not constitute an optimal contract
if the ®nancing ends ineciently early: T^ < T  :
A combination of debt and equity could relax the ®nancial constraints faced
by a pure equity solution. Common equity is inecient because equity gives too
little of the liquidation value to the venture capitalist in case the project fails. We
note ®nally that a pure debt contract may be inecient for exactly the opposite
reason. Debt may convey too much of the liquidation value to the venture capitalist and encourage premature liquidation.
6. Monitoring and job rotation
In this section aspects of relationship ®nancing are considered which may
reduce the ineciency indicated in Proposition 5: i monitoring and ii
changing the management. Both modi®cations imply the transfer of substantial
control rights to the venture capitalist and hence point to the relationship aspect
of venture capital ®nancing. The focus is on the optimal timing of these control
instruments.
Consider ®rst the possibility of monitoring the research eort of the venture
capitalist. Monitoring is costly and the venture capitalist has to spend mpt > 0
to monitor the entrepreneur in period t. 12 In return, the venture capitalist receives an accurate signal about the application of the funds. The signal is veri®able and hence punishment in case of a deviation (a signal which diers from
the contractually agreed eort) can be implemented. Hence, the moral hazard
problem is eliminated in the periods where monitoring takes place.

10

We recall that St is the minimal incentive compatible share if the entire R is distributed.
See Amit et al. (1997).
12
The cost of monitoring is thus linear in the ¯ow of funds cpt . It can be conceived as an
accounting or control system, the cost of which are increasing in the size of the operation to be
monitored.
11

<-----Page 21----->724

D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

The optimal timing is determined by the costs and bene®ts of monitoring in
the intertemporal agency problem. The expected present cost of monitoring in
period t is simply mpt adjusted by discounting and the probability of reaching
period t, as the project may be successfully completed before t. Hence the expected present cost of monitoring are decreasing with time. The bene®ts of
monitoring come from the static as well as the intertemporal component in
the share St . If monitoring occurs in period t then the share of entrepreneur
can be set to St  0, as there is no need to provide any incentives in period t.
But monitoring in period t also aects the incentives in all preceding periods.
We recall that the value of diverting funds in t0 < t was partially due to the possibility to have a share in the success later on. Monitoring in period t excludes
this option at least for period t and hence the share of the entrepreneur can be
reduced marginally in all periods preceding t. The direct bene®ts from monitoring St  0 are clearly decreasing in t due to discounting, but the indirect bene®ts increase as the number of periods which enjoy the marginal reduction
increase. Ecient monitoring occurs where the reduction in the informational
rent for the entrepreneur per unit cost of monitoring is maximized.
Proposition 7 (Monitoring policy). The optimal policy is to monitor towards the
end of the project.
Proof. See Appendix A.



Monitoring then occurs towards the end of the venture as the discounting of
the costs and the indirect bene®ts dominate the direct savings due to monitoring uniformly. Notice also that in the monitoring phase all the residual gains
are allocated to the investor.
The timing of the monitoring in our model is partially due to the uniform
rate at which information is generated. More generally, the bene®ts of monitoring in period t are increasing in the amount of information which is generated
in period t. Some other implications of a more general information structure
will be discussed in the next section.
Consider next the possibility of replacing the current manager, entrepreneur
or not, by a new manager. The ®nancing horizon T^ of the project may then be
subdivided into several managerial job spells. We investigate the following extension of the model. In any period t, the entrepreneur or the incumbent manager can be replaced by a new manager. There are no dierences between the
original entrepreneur and successive managers, in particular concerning productivity and moral hazard. As before, the entrepreneur initially owns the project and tries to capture as much of the surplus as possible.
Managerial job rotation reduces the informational rent of each manager by
restricting the duration of each individual manager. However, for the (initial)
entrepreneur and the investor outside managers are costly, as the founding

<-----Page 22----->D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

725

partners have to concede shares to the future managers. The objective for the
initial pair is therefore to minimize the pay-outs to succeeding managers. For
this reason, the replacement of the entrepreneur should be scheduled as late as
possible.
Each manager requires a compensation which is determined exactly as the
shares St of the entrepreneur. As there is no cost in replacing the manager,
the pay-out is minimized when the manager changes in every period. 13 The
cost of developing the venture with a sequence of manager is then equal to
cpt  cpt , where one term accounts for the cost of investment and the other
for the incentive costs of the manager. Proposition 2 indicates that the ecient
termination then occurs at T s .
Proposition 8 (Replacement).
i It is optimal to replace the entrepreneur if and only if the long-term contract
would otherwise stop at T^ < T s :
ii With optimal replacement the project will be stopped at T s . The entrepreneur remains in place until the value of the project net of compensations to the
managers is disbursed to her. Thereafter, a new manager is brought in every
period.
Proof. See Appendix A.



The replacement of the founding entrepreneur constitutes an empirical regularity in the venture capital industry, see Gorman and Sahlman (1989). We
may also add that earn outs are inecient in this framework. 14 The rationale
is essentially the same as the one exposed in Section 5. A quit payment works
against the idea of making all bene®ts contingent on success. Thus, one insight
of the present model is that earn outs, by providing insurance in the case of failure, are a costly practice in an environment with an uncertain completion date.
7. Discussion and extensions
In this paper, the venture is characterized by a simple binary structure. In
each period success is possible and the likelihood of success depends on the belief at and the intensity pt at which the project is developed. The investment
¯ow in¯uences only the probability by which success is generated, and the prize

13
We note that the general analysis suggested here carries over to more general settings with
switching costs or decreasing eciency of subsequent managers.
14
See Sahlman (1990) for the observation that the founding entrepreneur often receives little
protection against the threat of being put aside.

<-----Page 23----->726

R is constant over time. In this section we discuss how several extensions would
modify our results. We consider in particular i time-varying returns Rt , ii
multiple signals and staging and iii a time-varying information ¯ow.
Time varying returns Rt . The value of the successful realization, R, was assumed to be constant throughout this paper. But the investment process may
also have a cumulative eect on the value of a successful realization and hence
lead to an increasing sequence of Rt over time. An increasing value Rt would
tend to reduce the ineciency problem documented in Proposition 5. With
an increasing Rt , the share St of the entrepreneur could be reduced further towards the end as the incentive constraints are based on the composite St Rt .
Conversely, a decreasing sequence Rt would make funding even more precarious. The positive eect of an increasing Rt points to the importance of value
creation and production of tangible assets during the investment process. 15
Multiple signals and staging. This paper portrays a simple venture which
ends after a single positive signal is received. Clearly the arrival of good and
bad news may be a more complex process. Frequently, projects are divided into
various stages which are de®ned by the completion of certain intermediate results. In these circumstances continued ®nancing may be conditional on the
successful completion of earlier stages.
The basic model we analyzed describes the evolution of the incentives in any
component of such staged projects. The entire project would simply be a sequence of such stages, each giving rise to an optimal stopping time. In each individual problem Rt would constitute the continuation value after having
received an intermediate result. Each stopping problem determines how long
to wait for the arrival of an intermediate signal before the project is stopped.
Otherwise the previous analysis carries over and the share contract for each
stage concerns the sharing of the incremental value produced in that stage.
The sequential arrival of information then supports stage ®nancing as the
optimal arrangement. To see this, suppose the contracting parties had the
choice to contract either on a strong ®nal signal (i.e. completion of the marketable product) or on a ®ner sequence of intermediate signals. The sequencing,
implied by the staging, splits the horizon over which the intertemporal incentive constraints have to be compounded. In other words, the entrepreneur realizes that she must produce the intermediate result ®rst in order to receive
continued ®nancing. This reduces her incentives to procrastinate in the intermediate periods.
Time varying information ¯ow. The investment ¯ow cpt controls the conditional probability of success pt , and via pt , the evolution of the posterior from
at to at1 . The marginal cost of generating success in terms of probability was

15
Gompers (1995) presents evidence that the value of tangible assets and the length of the
®nancing rounds increase with the duration of the venture.

727

assumed to be constant in the level of pt (up to the maximum p) as well as constant over time.
The optimal investment problem with a general increasing and convex cost
function cpt  shares the same structural features as the model here, but, naturally, would not lead to an explicit solution as presented in Proposition 1
and 3. If the costs of generating success vary over time, then the information
¯ow, associated with pt , would be timed so as to coincide with periods where
the costs are relatively low. Periods with a higher pt would then constitute periods with a ``learning boost''. We saw in the previous section that the bene®ts
of monitoring are positively related to the volatility of information. Monitoring would then tend to occur in periods where much information is produced.
In the presence of sequential arrival of information, we would expect monitoring to be most prevalent in periods before the next ®nancing stage. 16
8. Conclusion
This paper investigated the provision of venture capital when the investment
¯ow controls the speed at which the project is developed. As the binary outcome of the project is uncertain, the speed of development in¯uences the (random) time at which the project yields success and the information which is
acquired by the investment ¯ow. The role of the entrepreneur is to control
the application of the funds which are provided by the venture capitalist.
The paper provides a rationale for long-term contracting as these contracts
achieve best the goal of distributing the entrepreneur's return over time in a
way which maximizes the research horizon. It is further shown that the compensation of the entrepreneur is similar to an option contract, and as such depends on the length of the contract and the volatility of the information
induced through her actions. The option expresses the value of the intertemporal incentive constraint. As the value of the option may become exceedingly
large, relationship ®nancing may become necessary. In consequence, the optimal timing of monitoring and replacement of the entrepreneur are analyzed.
The paper focuses on the ®nancing of venture projects. But the interaction
between investment and learning process and the incentives necessary to implement both processes is central for the ®nancing of R&D in general. The present
work may therefore be considered as a step in developing further insights into
the optimal ®nancing of innovation.

Consider now the optimal investment policy cpt in period t. By rewriting (A.4) as

A:5
it appears immediately that Eq. (A.5) is linear in pt , and thus it is either optimal
to allocate the capital maximally at cp or not to allocate any capital at all.
Hence until the project is stopped, in each period capital is allocated at the
maximal rate cp: In consequence the stopping time is given by T  as de®ned
in Eq. (10). By setting ps  p for all s  t; t  1; . . . ; T  , we obtain:

The proof to Proposition 3 relies on Lemma A.1, which describes the optimal policy for the entrepreneur.
V  a 0   a0 p  R ÿ c 

Lemma A.1 (Optimal policy of the entrepreneur).
i The optimal policy for the entrepreneur is always either p0  0 or p0  pt .
ii If the optimal policy is p0  pt for some at , then pt remains the optimal policy for all a > at .
Proof. i Consider ®rst the expected value of the entrepreneur for an arbitrary
assignment of shares, under the assumption that she truthfully applies the
funds to the project:

If the entrepreneur would consider diverting funds in period t, then she wishes

The expression Eq. (A.6) is linear in p0 and the ®rst part of the lemma follows
directly.
ii By the linearity of Eq. (A.6), if it is optimal to choose p0  pt > 0 under

where the ®rst inequality is due to the optimality and the second is due to
pt > 0. By monotonicity, the ®rst inequality is preserved by any a > at . 
Proof of Proposition 3. i Consider the value function ET a0  of the
entrepreneur in the initial period t  0, obtained solving Eqs. (17) and (18)
recursively. By Lemma A.1, ET a0  has to be equal to the value generated by a
maximal deviation today which is followed by compliance in all future periods:

which in turn is equivalent to ET a0   cp0  a0 =a1 dET a1 : The general recursion of the value function then yields:
at

from which we obtain after recursive substitution

A:11

which in turn is equivalent to Eq. (22) if pt  p for all t.
ii The share contract St is obtained by equating Eqs. (A.9) and (19) which
yields: at pt St R  cpt  at =at1 dpt ET at1 , and after using Eq. (A.9) again, we
get
at pt St R  1 ÿ pt cpt  pt ET at ;

A:12

which yields immediately Eq. (23) after replacing ET at  with the explicit expression obtained in Eq. (A.11) if pt  p for all t. Finally, pt  p follows immediately from Proposition 1 and the fact that the incentive compatible contract
St only depends on the continuation value as just described. 

Proof of Proposition 4. i Consider the share function St as derived in Eq. (23)

It is then sucient to prove that the share function St  S t as a continuous
function of t has at most one interior extremum, and that it has to be a maximum. Based on Eq. (A.13), one obtains after some rearranging: S 0 t ? 0 ()

from which it follows after inspection that S 0 t can cross zero at most once and
only from above.
ii By inspecting again condition Eq. (A.14), we ®nd that as d ! 1, the
right-hand side of the equivalent condition eventually becomes positive and
the left hand side negative, which proves the claim. 
Proof of Proposition 5. i Consider any project with at > as > at1 > a ; when
®nancing occurs at the rate of cp. Then, by Proposition 2, there will be no
®nancing in period t  1 with short-term contracts, although it would be
ecient, since at1 > a . Under a long-term contract, the investor can be given
at 1 ÿ St pR > pc in period t, and at1 1 ÿ St1 pR < pc, and have his intertemporal participation constraint balanced over the periods. This then allows
®nancing to proceed strictly longer than under a short-term contract and
enhance the eciency of the contractual arrangement.
ii The example associated with Fig. 3 veri®es the claim.
iii Consider the dierence VT a0  ÿ ET a0  for a given T, as given by Proposition 1 and 3. The dierence is increasing in R and a0 and decreasing with c.
The equilibrium horizon T^ can be increased with increases in the dierence
VT a0  ÿ ET a0 : 
Proof of Proposition 6. The value of the project with liquidation value, denoted
by VTL a0 , is given by
ÿ

T
VTL a0   VT a0   dT a0 1 ÿ p  1 ÿ a0  LT ;
where VT a0  is as de®ned earlier in Proposition 1. The duration T^ of the contract is determined by


	
T^  max T  1VTL a0  > ET a0  ;

A:15
^
where ET a0  is as de®ned in Proposition 3 and the last period T is again a
``winding-down'' period which insures that in equilibrium:
VT^L a0   ET^a0 :

A:16
The entrepreneur receives the loan necessary to pursue the project until T^ in
advance.
i Since the debt claim grows at the rate r, the investor is indierent over the
particular period t at which he claims payment of the debt as long as he is assured to receive Dt in the particular period t. Moreover, in any period in which
he does not claim the debt there is some probability that a success occurs.
Hence he will claim the debt only if no success has been observed in period
T^. By condition Eq. (A.16) he is willing to participate. Finally, for the entrepreneur, her share will be higher, namely At as speci®ed in Eq. (30), to compensate
her for the debt claim which has seniority. But At  R ÿ Dt  is just equal to the
minimal compensation St R, necessary to satisfy the intertemporal incentive
constraints as proven in Proposition 3. Hence the contract induces her to truthfully direct the funds to the project as well. Thus the speci®ed mixture of debt
and equity implements the optimal outcome.
ii The argument is almost identical to the one provided under i. 
Proof of Corollary 1. Suppose the entrepreneur receives a share AT > 0 of the
liquidation proceeds if liquidation occurs in T : The modi®ed incentive
constraint in period T then becomes
aT pAT R  1 ÿ aT pAT LT P cp  AT LT ;
which implies that surplus the entrepreneur can guarantee himself in T increases from cp to cp  AT LT . From Eq. (A.12) in the proof of Proposition 3, we can
then infer that this in fact increases At in all periods. Thus the value of the entrepreneur, denoted by ETL a0  when she receives a share of the liquidation value, is higher than when she does not. If T^, de®ned by


	
T^  max T  1VTL a0  > ETL a0  ;
is indeed smaller than T  , then we clearly have T > T^, with T being de®ned by


	
T  max T  1VTL a0  > ET a0  ;
since ET a0  < ETL a0 , for all T. But this implies in particular that
VTL a0  > VT^L a0  as T > T^. Since in equilibrium we have VT^L a0   ETL^a0  and
VTL a0   ETa0 , it follows that a pure sharing contract is not optimal and will
not be chosen in equilibrium by the entrepreneur. 
Proof of Proposition 7. Monitoring is costly and reduces the social surplus
which can be distributed between entrepreneur and venture capitalist. The

<-----Page 30----->D. Bergemann, U. Hege / Journal of Banking & Finance 22 (1998) 703±735

bene®t of monitoring is the reduction in Ea0  which can then be used to extend
the length of the project ®nancing. Monitoring should therefore occur in those
periods where the reduction in Ea0  is maximized per unit cost of monitoring.
The expected cost of monitoring in period t is given by C t ,
dt a0 1 ÿ pt  1 ÿ a0 mp. The bene®t of monitoring in period t only is
Bt , Ea0  ÿ Et a0 , where the superscript t denotes the period in which
monitoring occurs. We next compute the bene®t of monitoring explicitly.
Suppose we would monitor in period t, then the value to the entrepreneur in t is

which is veri®ed by substituting Eat  by Eat1 , using Eq. (A.9).

Proof of Proposition 8. i The social cost of continuation with a sequence of
one-period managers is cp  cp; where one term re¯ects the cost of ®nancing and
the other term the incentive costs to the manager. The ecient stopping point
for this arrangement is therefore as . The entrepreneur is only replaced by the
manager when it leads to the creation of surplus, which by implication can only
occur if exclusive ®nancing with the entrepreneur would only lead to T^ < T s .
ii The compensation to the managers is minimized by replacing them in
every period as they receive no intertemporal rents in this case. From the viewpoint of the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist, the compensation of new
managers is a cost as similar to the monitoring cost and hence the sequential
employment of entrepreneur and manager is as in the case of monitoring. 
