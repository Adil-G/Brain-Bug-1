Orientation–Sales
Growth Rate
Relationship

This research examined the effects of three strategic process variables—strategic decisionmaking participativeness, strategy formation mode, and strategic learning from failure—on
the entrepreneurial orientation (EO)–firm sales growth rate relationship. Results based on
a sample of 110 manufacturing firms indicated a positive effect of EO on sales growth rate.
Moreover, the relationship between EO and sales growth rate was more positive among
firms that employ autocratic decision making and that exhibit an emergent strategy
formation process. Perceptions of proficiency at learning from strategic mistakes differentially affected the growth rates of firms at different ends of the EO continuum, but in manners
inconsistent with the hypothesized relationship.

Introduction
Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has emerged as a major construct within the strategic management and entrepreneurship literatures over the years (Morris & Kuratko,
2002). EO is a strategic construct whose conceptual domain includes certain firm-level
outcomes and management-related preferences, beliefs, and behaviors as expressed
among a firm’s top-level managers. As originally proposed by Miller (1983), EO is
revealed through an organization’s exhibition of risk taking, innovativeness, and proactiveness. According to Miller (1983), the “entrepreneurial” label is most defensible as a
descriptor of established firms when those organizations are simultaneously risk taking,
innovative, and proactive with respect to their overall business operations, product offerings and technologies, and interactions with competitors, respectively. While these three
dimensions of EO can vary independently of one another (e.g., Kreiser, Marino, &

<-----Page 1----->Weaver, 2002), they typically tend to covary in the manner Miller identified as suggesting the presence of organizational-level entrepreneurship (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005).
Importantly, research has revealed strong linkages between EO and various firm-level
attributes and outcomes (e.g., Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Covin & Slevin, 1989;
Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003).
Within the realm of EO research, scholars have pursued a diverse set of objectives.
Principal among these are the identification of factors that predict EO (e.g., Miller &
Friesen, 1982; Zahra, 1991), the identification of EO’s effect on various dimensions of
firm performance (Lee, Lee, & Pennings, 2001; Wiklund, 1999; Zahra & Covin, 1995),
and the identification of variables that moderate the EO–firm performance relationship
(e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1988; Lumpkin & Dess, 2001; Yusuf, 2002). Collectively, as
observed by Zahra, Jennings and Kuratko (1999), knowledge accumulation around the
construct of EO has been substantial, driven largely by the widespread adoption within
the academic community of a common measure of EO sometimes referred to as the
“Miller/Covin and Slevin scale” (Brown, Davidsson, & Wiklund, 2001).
Nonetheless, key knowledge voids remain within the realm of EO research. With
their extensive review of the literature, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) concluded years ago
that the effect of internal organizational processes on the relationship between a firm’s
EO and its performance is an underexplored topic within the EO research realm. In
the intervening years, very little research has directly addressed this topic, prompting
Wiklund and Shepherd (2003) to recently renew the call for EO research focused on
investigating internal process-related moderators of the EO–performance relationship. A
focus on such research is warranted because it may shed needed light on the topic of how
firms can effectively manage firm-level entrepreneurial behavior. By contrast, much prior
EO research has simply focused on identifying nonmanagement-related contextual attributes (e.g., environmental conditions) conducive to EO’s emergence or effectiveness.
The current article describes a study that directly responds to the aforementioned call
for research. In particular, this study explored the moderating effects on the EO–firm performance relationship of (1) strategic decision-making participativeness (defined as the
extent to which the firm’s major operating and strategic decisions are made through consensus-seeking processes versus individualistic or autocratic processes by the formally
responsible executive), (2) strategy formation mode (defined as the extent to which the
firm’s strategy emerges over time versus is planned in advance of actions taken), and (3)
strategic learning from failure (defined as the firm’s self-reported proficiency at identifying its strategic mistakes or failed strategies, the causes of those failures, and the lessons
from those failures).

Theoretical Background and Hypotheses
Choice of Research Variables and Specification of the Research Model
Research variables were chosen for the current study based on their theoretical appropriateness as components of a process-focused EO model. Sales growth rate is the firmperformance variable examined in this research because an EO is, essentially, a growth
orientation (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). EO effectiveness is appropriately measured using
criteria that reflect a firm’s success at translating entrepreneurial opportunities into
growth trajectories. The aforementioned strategic process variables were chosen for
examination because they collectively constitute a theoretically meaningful gestalt
reflecting how firms strategize—i.e., how they choose, learn from, and refine or redefine
their major business-related decisions and the patterns they assume—and processes that
58

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->represent strategizing activity have been theoretically and empirically tied to a firm’s
position on the EO continuum (i.e., from conservative to entrepreneurial firms) (e.g.,
Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Entrailgo, Fernandez, & Vazquez, 2000). Firm strategizing
has two essential and mutually interdependent components—a decision-making component and a learning component. Strategic decision-making participativeness reflects
how a firm’s major business-related choices are arrived at. Strategy formation mode
reflects how those choices collectively shape the firm’s strategy, taking into account any
learning that occurs as decisions are made over time. And strategic learning from failure
takes this concept of learning one step further and specifically focuses on an aspect of
learning argued to be important in the context of entrepreneurial initiatives—that is, the
generation of knowledge from disappointing outcomes (McGrath, 1995; Sitkin, 1996).
Strategic process variables have generally been depicted in past research (e.g.,
Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Dean & Thibodeaux, 1994; Entrailgo et al., 2000) as
antecedents to a firm’s position on the EO continuum. Such a characterization fails to
account for the tight coupling (Weick, 1976) that occurs between strategy content and
strategic processes (e.g., Blair & Boal, 1991; Huff & Reger, 1987; Pettigrew & Whipp,
1991). As a strategy content-focused concept reflecting how firms explicitly or implicitly choose to compete (Covin, 1991), EO is likely to be reciprocally and continuously
linked to a firm’s strategic processes and is not simply an outcome (or antecedent) of
such processes. Significantly, the goodness-of-fit between strategy content and process is
commonly modeled as an interaction effect on firm performance (e.g., Ketchen, Thomas,
& McDaniel, 1996; Miller, 1989), with one category of variable (i.e., either strategy
content or strategy process) depicted as the independent variable and the other as the
moderator for data analysis purposes. The current article treats the strategy contentfocused concept of EO as the independent variable and the three strategic process variables as the moderators for theory building and data analysis purposes. This is consistent
with prior EO research that has explored the conditions under which EO affects performance (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1988; Lumpkin & Dess, 2001). It is also consistent with
Zahra’s (1993) depiction of internal processes as moderators of the EO–performance relationship and, in a more specific sense, with Miller and Friesen’s (1982) suggestion that
the successful enactment of an EO is contingent upon the characteristics of a firm’s strategic decision making and information management processes—processes that broadly
reflect strategizing activity, as discussed in the current article.

Strategic Process Moderators of the EO–Performance Relationship
Strategic Decision-Making Participativeness. Strategic decision-making participativeness—defined as the extent to which the firm’s major operating and strategic decisions
are made through consensus-seeking versus individualistic or autocratic processes by the
formally responsible executive—is the first strategic process hypothesized to moderate
the EO–performance relationship. Participativeness is explored in the current research
because, to quote Schweiger, Sandberg and Ragan (1986, p. 51), “Usually groups of managers with a variety of information and different perspectives address strategic problems.”
Participative decision making in its most basic form means joint decision making, or decision making in which more than one individual is actively involved in the decision
process (Locke, Schweiger, & Latham, 1986). Many specific techniques fall under the
umbrella of participative decision-making approaches. The nominal group technique, the
delphi technique, devil’s advocacy, and dialectical inquiry, for example, are all common
group decision-making techniques that represent specific, structured approaches to participative management. Thus, there are many distinct ways in which participative
January, 2006

59

<-----Page 3----->decision making is manifested and can be conceptualized and operationalized for research
purposes. In the current research, strategic decision-making participativeness is conceptualized as reflected in the extent to which multiple individuals are involved in consensus-oriented decision making.1
A focus on consensus seeking in the strategic decision process, defined as the achievement of general agreement among most or all of the individuals actively involved in the
decision process, was chosen for three reasons. First, consensus is widely regarded as an
important outcome of group decision-making processes (see Dess & Priem, 1995). On
this point, Whyte (1989, p. 41) stated that “the task, after all, of a decision-making group
is to produce consensus from the initial preferences of its members.” Second, unlike some
of the aforementioned group decision-making techniques (e.g., dialectical inquiry,
nominal group technique), consensus seeking does not assume the existence of a specific
structure to the decision-making process that may or may not exist when multiple individuals are actively involved in the decision process. Rather, consensus seeking represents a very basic form of decision-making participativeness that is likely to be observed
in the vast majority of circumstances in which multiple individuals are jointly involved
in the decision-making process. (It should be noted that even techniques designed to foster
conflict in the decision-making process—e.g., the devil’s advocacy technique, the dialectical inquiry technique—often have consensus as their ultimate goal [Fisher, 1980].
Finally, some of the theory offered below regarding why strategic decision-making participativeness ought to be a moderator of the EO–performance relationship is built on the
observation that it is often difficult to get multiple decision makers to agree that highrisk strategies, such as those employed by firms with strong EOs, should be pursued.
There are at least two rationales supporting the possibility that strategic decisionmaking participativeness moderates the EO–performance relationship. These rationales
relate to the impact of participativeness on decision speed and decision boldness. Specifically, participative management, despite its abundant benefits, can be administratively
burdensome and very time consuming (Cotton, Vollrath, Froggatt, Lengnick-Hall, &
Jennings, 1988; Vroom & Yetton, 1973). As such, during the time it takes to make major
operating and strategic decisions participatively, certain market windows may close,
effectively precluding slow movers from pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities contained therein. Even if market windows are not closed to slow movers, the quality of the
remaining opportunities may be diminished relative to those exploited by the early
entrants. Thus, although firms with EOs are, by definition, proactive, they will not be
quickly responsive to new market opportunities if their decision processes are slow. As
suggested by Nadler and Tushman (1999), more and better growth opportunities will be
available to firms that are able to increase their “strategic clock speed.” Highly participative decision-making processes are not necessarily more time consuming than less participative processes. In fact, fast and effective strategic decisions can often be made
1. Being “involved” in a decision can take many forms, from simply supplying informational input to a decision that is made by others to being “a” or “the” decision maker. The current operationalization of strategic
decision-making participativeness recognizes that, in the extreme case, there is one decision maker. However,
the matter of determining when there is more than one decision maker is often equivocal because, for
example, a group of individuals that makes a decision may or may not be formally acknowledged as a decision-making team. As such, respondents are asked to furnish information on items that pertain to generic
group processes like power sharing and consensus seeking. In short, consistent with Locke et al.’s (1986)
definition of participative decision making, the strategic decision-making participativeness scale items are
worded in manners that capture the extent to which multiple individuals are actively involved in the decision process, whether or not those involved are formally regarded as the decision makers or recognized as
members of decision-making teams.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->through appropriately designed participative decision processes (Eisenhardt, 1990).
Nonetheless, participative approaches to strategic decision making will sometimes be
an impediment to strategic clock speed. If this is the case, the value of an EO may be
diminished.
Strategic decision-making participativeness might also affect decision boldness that
could, in turn, impact the EO–performance relationship. Specifically, research suggests
that participative strategic decision making pertaining to innovation options will generally result in the choice of incremental, low-potential innovations over more radical, highpotential innovations (Wielemaker, Elfring, & Volberda, 2000). However, choosing
innovation options having high-variance outcomes, as would more radical innovations,
may offer the best chances for superior firm performance over the long term (McGrath,
1999). Hamel and Prahalad (1991) illustrate the difficulty of getting widespread agreement to pursue risky projects by explaining that firms often begin their evaluation of new
opportunities with an assessment of the downside risks of those opportunities. Perhaps
not surprisingly, the commitment of organizations to bold courses of action is often
depicted as resulting from convictions of single individuals who strategize and lead in
the “entrepreneurial mode” (Mintzberg, 1973). In short, the highest risk and highest
potential entrepreneurial opportunities may be systematically culled from consideration
in an entrepreneurial firm if the firm engages in participative management with respect
to its major operating and strategic decisions. Barring the consideration of such opportunities, the entrepreneurial firm may be limiting its growth potential.
Among firms at the conservative end of the EO continuum, however, a participative
approach to strategic decision making may have a positive impact on firm growth. As
previously suggested, participative strategic management can diminish the value-creation
potential of entrepreneurial firms by decreasing the likelihood that innovation options
with high-variance outcomes will be chosen. Getting multiple decision makers to support
highly exploratory behavior, such as that common among firms at the entrepreneurial end
of the EO continuum, can be very difficult (Levinthal & March, 1993). In conservative
firms, highly exploratory behavioral patterns are not part of the modus operandi. Therefore, participativeness in the strategic decision-making process will not detract from those
firms’ strategies on dimensions inherent to their attractiveness. Moreover, a participatory
process can breed commitment to a course of strategic action among decision makers as
well as verification that the course of action is defensible (Dess, 1987). These outcomes
may be particularly important to the success of conservative firms given the relatively
constrained opportunity set within which such firms operate. Exploratory behavior can
provide a safety net when a chosen strategic path yields poor results. Conservative firms
operate largely without this safety net in that they have committed to the exploitation of
known opportunities. Therefore, making the “right” strategic choices is arguably more of
a strategic imperative in the context of conservative firms, and the solicitation of input
from multiple decision makers can help ensure that the most accurate and complete information is considered in the decision process (Bourgeois & Brodwin, 1984).
Hypothesis 1: EO is more positively related to sales growth rate when major
operating and strategic decisions are made in less participative rather than in
more participative manners.
Strategy Formation Mode. A second strategic process hypothesized to impact the
EO–performance relationship is the process through which strategy is formed, herein
referred to as the firm’s strategy formation mode. As discussed extensively by Mintzberg
and Waters (1985), a firm’s strategy can emerge over time or can be planned in advance
January, 2006

61

<-----Page 5----->of actions taken, although viable strategies tend to mix qualities of both the emergent and
planned modes. Strategy formation mode is anticipated to impact the EO–performance
relationship for reasons pertaining to the incorporation of market feedback and the retention of strategic flexibility.
Product innovation is an inherently uncertain undertaking, made more so if the innovation takes the developing firm into unfamiliar market or technology arenas (Steele,
1989). Consequently, as entrepreneurial firms introduce new products into the market,
they will likely experience various levels of product acceptance. The most successful
entrepreneurial firms will be those that incorporate knowledge from their past innovation
experiences into their strategies and future innovations. Maidique and Zirger (1985)
explain that differences between customers’ and the firm’s perceptions conspire to limit
the success of new product development. If each new offering, in effect, is treated as a
test of those relative perceptions and the feedback is incorporated into future offerings,
the chances of success for those future offerings should improve. In short, strategies that
emerge and take advantage of the realtime knowledge gained through firm operations are
more likely to direct successful innovations than strategies that are planned in advance
and unaffected by market reactions to the firm’s offerings.
Likewise, emergent strategies can enable firms to postpone commitments to particular courses of action until the advisability of those actions becomes clear. The postponement of commitments may be of particular benefit when strategic actions—such as major
resource allocations—are difficult to reverse (Shimizu & Hitt, 2004). The irreversibility
of commitments makes it difficult for firms to take advantage of underestimated opportunities and reallocate resources away from overestimated opportunities. In the context
of entrepreneurial firms, the irreversibility of commitments can contribute to particularly
challenging decision environments because of the uncertain outcomes associated with
risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness. Thus, emergent strategies can enable entrepreneurial firms to retain the strategic flexibility they need to successfully operate under
conditions where the most defensible strategic paths are not easily knowable yet significant losses and opportunity costs may be incurred if the wrong strategic path is chosen.
By contrast, planned strategies should have greater utility in the context of conservative firms. The risk taking, innovativeness, and proactiveness of entrepreneurial firms,
as previously suggested, can inhibit a firm’s ability to accurately predict future business
scenarios. This is because the experimental nature of entrepreneurial actions tends to
produce organizational results and environmental responses that are difficult to anticipate
(Bhide, 1994). When the future is not predictable with any reasonable degree of accuracy, the value of planned strategies tends to be diminished because those strategies will
often be based on flawed assumptions and incomplete or inaccurate data (Mintzberg,
1990). The actions of conservative firms, being less experimental in character, tend to
produce organizational results and environmental responses that are somewhat easier to
anticipate inasmuch as risk aversion, noninnovativeness, and reactiveness are not the
inherent generators of uncertainty that their opposites are. With greater overall stability
and predictability in their operational domains, the managers of conservative firms can
have greater faith in the likely validity of their strategically relevant knowledge and
assumptions. This is not to suggest that conservative firms cannot benefit from incorporation of new knowledge into their strategies as they are being implemented. All firms
face uncertainty, and to embrace plans that are not appropriately modified as uncertainties are resolved is, to quote Mintzberg (1987, p. 26), “the perfect way to sail straight
into an iceberg.” Nonetheless, when informational inputs to the strategy-formation
process are less in doubt, as will more often be the case in conservative than in entrepreneurial firms, the planning of strategy becomes a more defensible option.
62

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Hypothesis 2: EO is more positively related to sales growth rate among firms whose
strategies are emergent rather than planned.
Strategic Learning from Failure. Strategic learning from failure—defined as the firm’s
self-reported proficiency at identifying its strategic mistakes or failed strategies, the
causes of those failures, and the lessons of those failures—is the final strategic process
hypothesized to moderate the EO–performance relationship. While strategic learning can
take many forms (Crossan & Berdrow, 2003), the current research focuses on one specific dimension—learning from failure—because the generation of knowledge from disappointing outcomes is argued to be essential to the success of future entrepreneurial
initiatives (Shepherd, 2003; Sitkin, 1996).
In general, entrepreneurial firms that learn from their strategic failures will attenuate
the inherently uncertain effects of their operational mode by relying on knowledge gained
through their past experiences as a basis for future decision making. In the new product
development arena, Maidique and Zirger (1985) suggested that “learning by failing”
occurs when failed products are recognized as probes that capture information about what
should be changed to make new efforts successful. While not assuring a positive outcome
for any single product trial, such learning has the potential to increase the overall odds
of future new product success. In the corporate venturing arena, McGrath (1995, p. 141)
has argued that it is important “to treat disappointment not as a disgrace, but as a valuable source of new insight.” This is because ventures are often fraught with uncertainty
and typically involve a high degree of trial-and-error learning. The occasional or even
frequent failure of ventures among firms that venture extensively is inevitable. Firms that
are able to capture knowledge surrounding failed ventures were argued by McGrath
(1995) to be better positioned than those that do not to avoid similar mistakes in the
future. Inasmuch as corporate venturing, like new product development, could be manifested in organizations exhibiting a strong EO, a positive moderating effect of strategic
learning from failure on the EO–performance relationship is plausible.
Such an effect might also be inferred when considering firms at the low end of the
EO continuum. Huber (1991) observed that learning per se does not necessarily produce
positive results. This is because what is learned will sometimes be erroneous. As such,
the inferences made when a firm’s strategy fails will not always serve the firm’s best
interests—the “lessons” may be factually incorrect or otherwise misinformed. Nonetheless, and on the whole, it is anticipated that conservative firms, like entrepreneurial firms,
will benefit in a growth-facilitating sense when they learn from their strategic mistakes.
Conservative firms may simply benefit less from such learning than their entrepreneurial counterparts. Specifically, relative to entrepreneurial firms, conservative firms may
have fewer opportunities to apply the lessons of their failures to future initiatives, given
the typically more constrained scope of its operations. As noted by Nonaka (1994), for
knowledge to be of value, it must be leveraged, and fewer leveraging opportunities should
result in less benefit accruing to firms that purport to have learned from their strategic
failures.
Additionally, the number of opportunities firms have to learn from their strategic failures may be fewer among conservative than among entrepreneurial firms. Conservative
firms, by definition, innovate less and take fewer risks than entrepreneurial firms. Therefore, the failure-related lessons of conservative firms may be inferred from fewer learning opportunities. In general, given the cumulative character of the knowledge-acquisition
process (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990), lessons based on fewer learning opportunities may
not be as accurate or otherwise valuable as those based on more such opportunities. Thus,
the quality of the knowledge derived from a firm’s strategic mistakes may be somewhat

<-----Page 7----->diminished among conservative firms relative to entrepreneurial firms. If this is the case,
then conservative firms might be expected to benefit less than entrepreneurial firms from
the lessons inferred from failed strategies.
Hypothesis 3: EO is more positively related to sales growth rate among firms reporting higher rather than lower proficiency at learning from their strategic failures.

Methods
Sample and Data Collection
Data for this research were collected in cooperation with and under the partial sponsorship of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Industrial Resource Center—a regional economic development organization. With this organization’s census of businesses in the
tristate (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia) region, a total of 418 firms were selected
for this study using the criteria that they be nondiversified business units (as classified
by the sponsoring organization and verified by the respondents) that are manufacturing
based and have 50 or more employees. Only single (or primary) industry firms were
included in the sample because diversified firms might employ different strategic
processes across their product lines or business units, a possibility that would confound
any results. By focusing on manufacturing-based organizations, the study effectively controlled for macroindustry effects through the elimination of multiple and diverse industry sectors (e.g., agriculture, mining, wholesale, and retail trade) from the sample. Finally,
by selecting only firms with 50 or more employees, predictable (small) size-related biases
on the research variables might be avoided (e.g., smaller firms characteristically exhibit
more emergent strategy-formation patterns ([Mintzberg, 1973]) and the measures would
be meaningful in the organizational contexts under consideration. Regarding this latter
point, the strategic decision-making participativeness scale, for example, implicitly
assumes the existence of a certain minimal administrative hierarchy that might be absent
in very small firms.
Consistent with the procedure followed by Greer and Ireland (1992), two questionnaires were sent (along with self-addressed, stamped, return envelopes) to the seniormost executive in each of the 418 firms selected for the study. The senior-most executive,
considered the primary respondent, was asked to complete one questionnaire personally
and to select another senior executive to serve as a secondary respondent. This secondary
respondent was to be chosen by the primary respondent on the basis of the former’s
overall understanding of the business and involvement in the firm’s strategic processes.
Data from the secondary respondents were used solely for measure corroboration purposes. Firms that did not respond to the initial request for data were contacted a second
time via telephone 1 month after the initial contact.
Usable responses were eventually received from 170 respondents (115 primary and
55 secondary), representing 115 firms, for an organizational response rate of 27.5 percent
(115/418). The current study focused on 110 firms for which complete data were available on this study’s measures. The 110 firms in the final sample represented 76 different
4-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) codes, with no single 4-digit SIC code represented by more than seven firms. Seventy-two of the 110 firms were privately held, and
38 were publicly owned. The average sales revenue and age of the firms in the sample
were $123.26 million (SD = $422.10 million) and 47.35 years (SD = 30.74 years), respectively. The average number of employees among the sampled firms was 743.68 (SD =
2,374.91). Seven of the sampled firms reported slightly fewer employees than the

<-----Page 8----->50-employee minimum screen (figure identified through secondary sources) initially used
to select the sample. Nonetheless, the size of the smallest firms in the sample (four firms
reported having 40 employees) was deemed close enough to the initial cutoff size to
warrant their retention in the sample. The size range of the sample is 40–21,000 employees. The distribution of the sample is as follows: 40–49 employees, 7 firms; 50–99
employees, 32 firms; 100–249 employees, 29 firms; 250–499 employees, 18 firms; 500
or more employees, 24 firms.
Results of t-test comparisons of the average size (measured as both number of
employees and annual sales revenue) and age of the responding firms with these same
data for the nonresponding firms (when available through secondary sources—e.g.,
Ward’s Business Directory of U.S. Private and Public Companies) revealed no differences (i.e., p > .10) between these two subgroups. Thus, the sample appears to be representative of the population from which it was drawn on these basic organizational
attributes. Similarly, t-test comparisons of the early respondents (i.e., those firms that
returned the questionnaire before being contacted a second time) and the late respondents
(i.e., those firms that returned the questionnaire only after having been asked a second
time) revealed no differences (i.e., p > .10) between these two subgroups in number of
employees, annual sales revenue, firm age, or any of the research variables assessed in
this study.

Measures
The following paragraphs describe the measures employed in this research.2 Table 1
shows the summary statistics (i.e., means scores, SDs, and Cronbach alpha coefficients,
where appropriate) and correlation matrix.
Results of t-tests comparing the primary and secondary respondents’ mean scores on
each research variable revealed no significant differences (i.e., p > .10) between these
two respondent categories. Thus, across the sample, no discernable measurement bias
was attributable to whom the respondent was within the firm. Moreover, a multivariate
analysis of variance test revealed that between-firm differences on the research variables
were significantly greater than within-firm differences (Hotelling’s T2 = 33.95; p = .000),
suggesting that systematic firm-level differences were being captured by the measures,
and that primary and secondary respondents within individual firms perceived their firm’s
attributes at a level of similarity that would not be predicted by chance alone. Overall,
data furnished by the secondary respondents support the treatment of the primary respondents as key informants in this research.
Firm Sales Growth Rate. Firm performance was operationalized in this study as a firm’s
sales growth rate relative to its industry. Firm sales growth was measured as the firm’s
average rate of growth in sales revenue over the most recent 3-year period. Self-reported
sales revenue figures were corroborated with secondary data whenever possible. In cases
where both data types were available, the primary data matched the secondary data or
were rounded approximations of the latter. Because of the differing growth rates of
the industries represented in the sample, the 3-year average growth rate of the firm’s

which is an indicator of the scales’ convergent validity. Evidence of significant internal-response consistency
was observed for each of the multi-item scales. The specific tests employed are available from the first author
upon request.

<-----Page 10----->principal industry (as calculated from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Annual Survey
of Manufactures) was subtracted from the firm’s 3-year average growth rate. This industry-controlled relative growth rate figure was then used as the dependent variable in the
hypothesis testing.
EO. EO was measured using the nine-item, 7-point scale proposed by Covin and Slevin
(1989) and was partially based on prior items adapted from Khandwalla (1976/1977),
and Miller and Friesen (1982). For this and other multi-item scales employed in this
research, the average of the individual item scores was used as the scale’s score. Higher
overall scores on this scale indicate a more EO.
Strategic Decision-Making Participativeness. This construct was measured with a fiveitem, 7-point scale developed expressly for this research. The items of this scale included
the following: (1) Our major operating and strategic decisions result from consensusoriented decision making; (2) our major operating and strategic decisions are made by
single individuals with responsibility in the decision area (reverse coded); (3) our business unit’s philosophy is to involve all levels of management in major operating and
strategic decisions; (4) consensus seeking is a common and pervasive decision-making
practice in my business unit; and (5) information and power are shared extensively in
making decisions in my business unit. A higher score on this scale indicates a more participative decision-making style.
Strategy Formation Mode. Slevin and Covin’s (1997) five-item, 7-point scale was used
to measure the construct of strategy formation mode. The items of this scale included the
following: (1) We typically do not know what the content of our business strategy should
be until we engage in some trial and error actions (reverse coded); (2) my business unit’s
strategy is carefully planned and well understood before any significant competitive
actions are taken; (3) formal strategic plans serve as the basis for our competitive actions;
(4) my business unit’s strategy is typically not planned in advance but, rather, emerges
over time as the best means for achieving our objectives become clearer (reverse coded);
and (5) competitive strategy for my business unit typically results from a formal business-planning process (i.e., the formal plan precedes the action). A low score on this scale
indicates an emergent strategy pattern, while a higher score indicates a planned or
intended strategy orientation.
Strategic Learning from Failure. This construct was measured with a three-item, 7point scale developed expressly for this research. The items of this scale included the
following: (1) My business unit is good at identifying strategies that have not worked;
(2) my business unit is good at pinpointing why failed strategies have not worked; and
(3) my business unit is good at learning from its strategic/competitive mistakes.
Higher scores on this measure indicate a greater degree of perceived proficiency at learning from strategic failure.
For the purpose of determining the structure of the strategic process data, the 13 items
of the previously mentioned measures were factor analyzed using principal components
analysis and a varimax rotation. Results indicated that the 13 items load (using a loading
criterion of .50) on three separate factors corresponding to the theoretical structure of the
scales. Moreover, no items loaded on more than one factor, and in all cases the items that
loaded on a factor did so at a magnitude of at least twice that of the nonloading items.
In short, the factor analysis suggested a very clean factor structure for the strategic process
scales.

<-----Page 11----->Firm size and age were controlled in this research because of the expectation that the
strategic processes of interest might vary systematically with these variables (see, for
example, Adizes, 1989; Mintzberg, 1979).
Firm Size. The measure of firm size used in this study is the firm’s number of employees, as reported by the respondents.
Firm Age. Firm age was assessed as the number of years the firm had been in business,
as reported by the respondents.
Two environmental measures—environmental dynamism and environmental hostility—were treated as control variables in this research because they have both been repeatedly shown to impact the relationship between EO and firm performance (e.g., Lumpkin
& Dess, 2001; Miller & Friesen, 1983).
Environmental Dynamism. The construct of environmental dynamism was measured
using a slightly modified version (altered response format) of Miller and Friesen’s (1982)
five-item, 7-point scale. Higher scores reflected more dynamic environments.
Environmental Hostility. The construct of environmental hostility was measured using
Slevin and Covin’s (1997) six-item, 7-point scale. Higher scores reflected more hostile
environments.

Analytical Techniques
Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. In all equations, the
control variables were entered before the other independent variables to partial out their
effects from the relationships of principal interest. For firm size and age, natural logs
were used to account for somewhat skewed distributions within these data. The hypotheses were tested using the moderated regression analysis technique recommended by
Arnold (1982).
Correlations between EO and the three strategic process variables were all modest,
ranging from r = .20 to r = .36. Thus, multicolinearity within these data does not appear
to be a problem. Nonetheless, to minimize correlations between the independent variables and their interaction terms, the independent variables were centered in the manner
suggested by Aiken and West (1991) before the computation of the interaction terms.
Correlations among the strategic process variables range from r = .19 to r = .47. To determine whether the strategic process variables have distinct versus overlapping moderating effects, these effects were tested in separate models for each hypothesis as well as in
a full model composed of all variables in this study.

Tests for Common Method Bias
Two tests were conducted to determine whether method effects were being produced
by using common data sources (see Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003 for
a review of method effect tests).3 In the first test, data from a primary source (the sales
3. Harman’s single-factor test was also performed on the dataset. In particular, the 33 items used to construct the multi-item scales were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis and the unrotated factor solution was examined. A total of nine factors (with eigenvalues greater than 1) were extracted, with the first
factor accounting for 19.9 percent of the covariance among the items. This type of result (where more than

68

secondary respondents from within the same firms) were used for hypothesis testing purposes. Both tests suggested that any possible method effects in the data were likely to be
minimal and, therefore, were not a significant influence on the current results.4

Results
Table 2 presents the regression analysis results. Model 1 is the base model, containing only the control variables. None of these variables significantly predict firm sales
growth rate. Model 2 contains results pertaining to the main effect of EO on sales growth
rate. Consistent with the results of, for example, Lee et al. (2001) and Wiklund (1999),
EO has a positive effect on sales growth rate. However, the magnitude of this effect is
only marginally significant (p < .10). Models 3 through 6 contain the interaction terms
around which the hypotheses were offered.
The significant (p < .001) and negative beta for the EO × strategic decision-making
participativeness interaction term shown in Model 3 is consistent with hypothesis 1. Thus,
among the sampled firms, EO has a more positive effect on sales growth rate when major
operating and strategic decisions are made in autocratic versus participative manners.5
one factor is extracted and the first factor explains a minority of the covariance among the items) has often
been offered as evidence that a dataset has not been significantly affected by common method bias. However,
arguments by Podsakoff et al. (2003) suggest that Harman’s single-factor test is, in fact, a weak diagnostic
test of common method bias. The tests reported here are more sensitive means to assess possible evidence
of common method bias.
4. Specifically, in test one, secondary sales data that were available for 25 of the firms in the sample were
used to compute a correlation coefficient for the relationship between the firms’ actual, year-to-year sales
figures and the respondents’ self-reported three-year average sales growth rates. The primary and secondary
sales data for these 25 firms have a correlation of r = .85. The fact that the primary sales data closely mirror
the secondary data suggests that the dependent variable used in the current research has not been significantly influenced by rater bias. The absence of significant method effects was also suggested in a second test
that used data on the independent variables furnished by the primary respondents and data on the dependent
variable furnished by the secondary respondents. In particular, the regression model containing the complete
set of research variables (equivalent to Model 6 in Table 2) was run using the subset of cases in which the
secondary respondents furnished complete sales growth rate data (n = 49). The model results were very
similar to those reported in the current article. Specifically, the model R2 obtained in this supplemental analysis based on 49 cases was .25 (versus .23 using the complete set of 110 firms and only those data furnished
by the primary respondents, as shown in Table 2). Moreover, each of the betas associated with a hypothesis
test had the same sign as that found using the larger dataset furnished solely by the primary respondents.
The only result that dropped out of the significance range (i.e., p > .10) in the reduced dataset was the one
pertaining to the EO × strategic learning-from-failure interaction. This interaction coefficient, nonetheless,
exhibited a significance level of p = .135 in the reduced dataset and, in fact, had a marginally greater standardized beta than that found when using the complete dataset (beta = −.302 versus −.213). In short, the
equivalency of the results obtained using the complete dataset (i.e., the primary-respondent-only dataset based
on 110 cases) and the reduced dataset (i.e., the 49-case dataset compiled from data furnished by both the
primary and secondary respondents) suggested that common methods have not introduced bias into the
observed pattern of results.
5. To determine whether the results pertaining to the participativeness scale were affected by the inclusion
of consensus-related items in the scale, two subscales were created from the overall, five-item scale and the
analyses were rerun. In one of the subscales, only the three items that do not contain the word “consensus”
were included (alpha = .78). In the other subscale, only the “consensus” items were included (alpha = .80).
Both subscales yielded results consistent with those of the overall, five-item participativeness scale reported
here. That is, both EO × strategic decision-making participativeness interaction terms had negative betas and
were significant at the p < .001 level.

EO, entrepreneurial orientation.

Hypothesis 2 is also supported by the data. Model 4 reveals a significant (p < .05) and
negative beta for the EO × strategy formation mode interaction term, indicating that EO
has a more positive effect on sales growth rate when strategies emerge than when they
are planned in advance of actions taken. Model 5 contains the results pertaining to hypothesis 3. The interaction of EO and strategic learning from failure is highly significant
(p < .01). However, it is in the opposite direction of that hypothesized.
Finally, Model 6 contains the overall set of research variables. When examined in
the full model, the previously significant interaction effect between EO and strategy
formation mode disappears. Notably, this was the weakest of the three interaction effects
uncovered, and the correlations between strategy formation mode and the other two
strategic process variables are moderate (r = .47 with strategic decision-making participativeness, and r = .36 with strategic learning from failure). Apparently, the three
observed strategic process indicators, when treated as moderators, explain overlapping
portions of the variance in sales growth rate, with the predictive power of the EO × strategy formation mode interaction being largely captured by the other effects.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->In recognition of the ongoing conversation within the literature regarding the appropriateness of researching EO as a unidimensional versus multidimensional construct
(see, for example, Dess & Lumpkin, 2005), the relationships explored here were also
examined in supplementary analyses that treated the subdimensions of EO—that is, risk
taking, innovation, and proactiveness—as separate research variables. The results of these
analyses, along with a commentary on the EO dimensionality issue, are presented in the
Appendix.

Discussion
The results suggest that the effects of EO on a firm’s growth rate depend on several
strategic process-related variables. Regarding the observed moderating effect of strategic decision-making participativeness, arguably, an EO is, at its core, a growth orientation (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Consistent with the current results, a more autocratic/less
participative style of top management has been advocated for firms with growth-seeking
strategies (e.g., Covin, Slevin, & Schultz, 1997; Geller, 1980). This is an interesting point
to consider because an overall low level of decision-making participativeness is an
attribute not typically associated with effective entrepreneurial firms. In fact, such firms
tend to be relatively organic in structure (Covin & Slevin, 1988), an attribute more often
associated with greater decision-making participativeness (Burns & Stalker, 1961). The
key distinction to note is that the current study assessed participativeness as it pertains
to the making of major operating and strategic decisions, not participativeness as a generalized decision-making approach employed across organizational levels. Clearly, the
utilization of relatively autocratic approaches to strategic decision making does not
preclude firms from exhibiting EOs. In short, while low strategic decision-making participativeness and high EO may seem an incongruent mix of organizational conditions,
when one considers that EO is essentially a growth orientation, the potential value of
relatively autocratic leadership as a facilitator of EO effectiveness has more obvious
plausibility.
The observed positive effect on the EO–sales growth rate relationship of an emergent (versus planned) strategy formation mode is more in keeping with what one might
expect on the basis of prior research on the relationship between EO and strategic management practice. In particular, several studies have reported positive associations
between EO and planning flexibility (Barringer & Bluedorn, 1999; Kemelgor, 2002) as
well as between EO and strategic adaptiveness (Dean & Thibodeaux, 1994). An emergent strategy formation mode would be consistent with the exhibition of planning flexibility and strategic adaptiveness. As an important point of departure from prior research
that simply explored relationships between EO and various strategic management practices, the current research examined how certain of these practices affect the EO–
performance relationship. Thus, while prior research only implies that planning flexibility
represents a good “fit” with an EO, this implication is directly tested in the current
research. Specifically, EO can be more definitively claimed to fit with planning flexibility (as evidenced through an emergent strategy formation mode) because this combination promotes firm sales growth rate.
The hypothesized impact of strategic learning from failure on the EO–performance
relationship was not found. In fact, there was a significant relationship in the opposite
direction. This result suggests that, contrary to hypothesis 3, conservative firms benefit
more than entrepreneurial firms in a growth-facilitating sense when they learn from
their strategic mistakes. Stated differently, the negative beta for the EO × strategic
January, 2006

71

<-----Page 15----->learning-from-failure interaction term suggests that entrepreneurial firms are less penalized than conservative firms when they are not highly proficient at learning from their
strategic mistakes.
A hint as to why learning from their strategic mistakes may be of particular value to
conservative firms was suggested in the theoretical development of hypothesis 1. Specifically, it was observed that conservative firms strongly emphasize the exploitation of
known opportunities over the exploration of new opportunities. For any given strategic
decision or option, then, this bias may result in selection of the “right” choice being more
critical among conservative than among entrepreneurial firms. This is because conservative firms do not have a substantial safety net of innovativeness as a basis for growth.
By contrast, the innovativeness of entrepreneurial firms may create a relative robustness
or resiliency to individual failures that allow them to grow despite the fact that their learning from past strategic mistakes may not be regarded as particularly high.

Theoretical Implications
Four principal theoretical implications can be gleaned from the current research. First,
the value of adopting an EO is largely determined by the characteristics of the context
in which this orientation is employed. The current research adds “strategic process considerations” to the long list of organizational (e.g., Covin & Slevin, 1988; Wiklund &
Shepherd, 2003) and environmental factors (e.g., Lumpkin & Dess, 2001; Zahra & Covin,
1995) previously assessed as moderators of the EO–performance relationship. In the
current study, as in many prior studies, the moderating effects of the observed contextual
factors on the EO–performance relationship are many times stronger than the main effect
of EO on performance. Thus, consistent with Lumpkin and Dess’s (1996) advice, future
theory pertaining to the EO construct should focus on identifying those factors that likely
moderate the EO–performance relationship.
Second, effective entrepreneurial firms do not appear to be strategically managed by
consensus. Rather, such firms seem to benefit in a growth-facilitating sense from a strategic process that is relatively autocratic in nature. Several rationales were offered for this
possibility in the theoretical development of hypothesis 1. In addition, it may be that
strategic consensus seeking undermines the ability of entrepreneurial firms to narrow their
business foci sufficiently to realize economies of scope from their operations. This is
because strategic consensus seeking may result in “accommodating” decisions that define
the firm’s strategic domain very broadly and that, consequently, enable the firm to pursue
a disparate, noncumulative array of entrepreneurial opportunities. Porter (1996) noted
that the essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. By allowing many to have their
say at the strategic decision table, firms may find it difficult to maintain the clarity and
singularity of focus that research and theory suggest are hallmarks of effective entrepreneurial firms (Maidique & Hayes, 1984).
Third, EOs appear most facilitative of firm growth when firms with these orientations employ strategy formation processes that match the unique requirements of acting
entrepreneurially. This means allowing strategy to form or emerge as entrepreneurial
opportunities arise (or are created through strategic proactiveness) and are chosen for
pursuit. Consistent with Ireland, Hitt, and Sirmon’s (2003) observations on the concept
of strategic entrepreneurship, effective entrepreneurial firms will generally maneuver
deliberately and purposefully toward their strategic goals. The current research suggests
that such maneuvers may be more emergent rather than planned in character. As argued
by Mintzberg and Waters (1985), strategy formation in an emergent mode is often
72

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->advisable because it enables firms to manage the uncertainty inherent to their operations.
Firms with EOs have, by definition, inherently uncertain operations, so an emergent strategy formation process can be highly appropriate. By contrast, planned strategies in entrepreneurial firms will often reflect assumptions that must be taken on faith and are unlikely
to be tested according to the tenets of milestone/discovery-driven planning (Block &
MacMillan, 1985; McGrath & MacMillan, 1995), the approach to planning often advocated in entrepreneurial contexts. If the key assumptions on which entrepreneurial firms’
plans are based are inaccurate, these plans will not serve the firms’ purposes well. In
short, an emergent approach to strategy formation appears to best enable entrepreneurial
firms to capture the benefits of their innovativeness.
Fourth, the failure of a firm to learn from its strategic mistakes is likely to be more
detrimental to the future performance of conservative than of entrepreneurial firms. The
former firms engage in fewer and less risky strategic initiatives. In an absolute sense,
there may be fewer opportunities for growth in such firms relative to more entrepreneurial
firms. Significantly, if a strategic initiative is perceived as having failed in a conservative firm, the chances are lower than in entrepreneurial firms that new initiatives will be
available for consideration and for possible adoption. Also, those available may be of
dubious quality if they are related to past failed initiatives and if the conservative firm
does not perceive itself as proficient at learning from its strategic mistakes.
Entrepreneurial firms, however, follow initiative with initiative, often in rapid succession. If one innovative effort does not succeed, another might. Importantly, a perceived
failure to learn among entrepreneurial firms may be associated with the presence of high
innovation success rate expectations. The managers of firms that innovate extensively
could perceive their firms as not good at learning from failure if their innovation “hit
rate” does not improve over time. However, as reported by Roberts (1980), innovation
success does not appear to grow commensurately with the number of initiatives pursued.
Therefore, entrepreneurial firms may tend to underestimate their actual learning from
strategic mistakes.

Research Limitations
The preceding theoretical implications should be considered in light of the study’s
research limitations. Three such limitations are, perhaps, most noteworthy. First, the study
relied upon self-report measures for key research variables. Measures of the independent
variables correlated in expected manners with theoretically related variables, per tests of
internal-response consistency performed on the multi-item scales.6 However, the measures could not be corroborated with relevant secondary data as none were available. As
such, while the measures arguably have face validity and evidence of their convergent
validity has been suggested, their construct validity has not been directly tested. Second,
cross-sectional data were used to test the study’s hypotheses. Thus, causal relationships
among the research variables are impossible to infer from the research findings. Prior
longitudinal research suggests that EO has a positive impact on firm performance (e.g.,
Zahra & Covin, 1995). Likewise, a longitudinal design would be needed to determine
whether some of the specific dynamics implied in the current theory development, in fact,
play out in practice. Finally, the dependent variable employed in this research—firm
sales growth rate, while appropriate for assessing a firm’s effectiveness at the pursuit
of entrepreneurial opportunities (see Davidsson, Delmar, & Wiklund, 2002), and a
6. These tests are available from the first author upon request.

73

<-----Page 17----->defensible dependent variable in the context of the current study, does not imply anything about a firm’s efficiency at generating positive financial returns from its operations.
Indeed, growth and profitability—roughly corresponding to a firm’s effectiveness versus
efficiency (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986) or success at exploration-related versus
exploitation-related activities (March, 1991)—are two distinct and often minimally correlated dimensions of a firm’s financial performance (see Murphy, Trailer, & Hill, 1996).
The possibility exists that combinations of strategic processes and EO that predict firm
growth do not, correspondingly, predict firm profitability.

Suggestions for Future Research
Future research on the construct of EO might take any of several promising directions. Two research foci are herein proposed. First, future research should further investigate the phenomenon of learning in entrepreneurial-firm contexts in which innovation
failures may be commonplace. A possible question that might be addressed is whether
entrepreneurial firms do, in fact, generally increase their innovation hit rate as a function
of times “at bat.” Roberts’s (1980) aforementioned observation suggests this may not be
the case. If entrepreneurial firms do not become more proficient at innovation as they
innovate more, in what ways or through what processes do past innovation successes and
failures impact future innovation efforts? If, contrary to Roberts’s (1980) observation, the
innovation success rate increases linearly with initiatives pursued, what knowledge is
gained that allows this to happen? Perhaps most fundamentally, what do effective entrepreneurial firms do to leverage knowledge from past innovation failures into future innovation successes?
A second proposed research focus is the examination of additional strategic attributes as potential moderators of the EO–performance relationship. Attributes involving a
firm’s strategic intent—such as the clarity of that intent, the commitment to that intent,
and the ambitiousness of that intent—may hold particular promise as focal points for
future EO research. Theory suggests that strategic intent—i.e., a firm’s preferred, longterm position, as articulated by top management (Hamel & Prahalad, 1989)—enables
firms to weed out unnecessary sources of “variation” (e.g., frivolous or otherwise nonstrategic innovation) and gives firms “something to ‘aim’ for” (Lovas & Ghoshal, 2000,
p. 885). These can be significant concerns among entrepreneurial firms (Morris &
Kuratko, 2002). Suggested research questions include the following: Does the extent to
which a firm’s objectives represent “stretch goals” impact the relationship between EO
and firm growth? What is the relationship between EO effectiveness and the specificity
and clarity of a firm’s long-term objectives? Does intraorganizational awareness of strategic intent lead to the pursuit of more focused or synergistic entrepreneurial initiatives
and, if so, are these the types of initiatives that most likely benefit the firm?

Conclusion
In conclusion, to argue that established firms must learn to act entrepreneurially is
no longer a novelty, and the reasons they could benefit from doing so are generally well
known (Ireland et al., 2003; Zahra et al., 1999). What is less obvious, and an uncertainty
that researchers should increasingly address, is what managers can do to best assure the
success of their firms’ entrepreneurial activity. The current results suggest that a managerial focus on identifying and implementing appropriate strategic processes may be a
useful first step in the pursuit of EO effectiveness.

APPENDIX
A Comment and Empirical Results Pertaining to the Dimensionality of EO
A debate has surfaced in the entrepreneurship literature concerning whether EO is
most appropriately conceptualized as a unidimensional construct (albeit one comprised
of risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness “elements”), as originally proposed by
Miller (1983), or a multidimensional construct, as later proposed by Lumpkin and Dess
(1996). At the core of the debate is the matter of whether the “subdimensions” of EO—
risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness (Lumpkin and Dess add autonomy and competitive aggressiveness to this list)—must or simply may vary independently of one
another. Stetz, Howell, Stewart, Blair, and Fottler (2000) and Kreiser, Marino, and
Weaver (2002) have attempted to resolve this debate on empirical bases. Stetz et al.
(2000) used data collected from 865 healthcare executives and structural equation modeling techniques to reach their conclusion that the subdimensions of EO can vary independently of one another. Likewise, based on data collected from 1,067 firms in six
countries, Kreiser et al. (2002) presented confirmatory factor analysis- and correlational
analysis-based results demonstrating that the three subdimensions of EO display “significant independent variance” and, therefore, should be treated as “unique” variables in
the context of EO research. Given the extensiveness of Stetz et al.’s and Kreiser et al.’s
data collection efforts and the sophistication of their analytical techniques, the debate
over the dimensionality of the EO construct could be regarded as largely resolved.
However, there is a theoretical aspect to this debate that has been overlooked in the literature and should be considered when the construct of EO is discussed. This theoretical issue relates to how EO is defined in the literature.
Specifically, Miller (1983, p. 780) has argued that, “[i]n general, theorists would not
call a firm entrepreneurial if it changed its technology or product line (“innovated”
according to our terminology) simply by directly imitating competitors while refusing to
take any risks. Some proactiveness would be essential as well. By the same token, risktaking firms that are highly leveraged financially are not necessarily entrepreneurial. They
must also engage in product-market or technological innovation.” Thus, Miller reserved
the label of “entrepreneurial” for firms that are concurrently risk taking, innovative, and
proactive. Miller never argued that risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness could not

<-----Page 23----->vary independently of one another. Rather, he said that when they do vary independently
of one another, he would not consider the firm exhibiting this pattern of behavior to be
entrepreneurial. As such, Miller originally proposed the construct of EO as a formative
construct, i.e., as a construct that cannot be decomposed into its constituent elements
(because, in doing so, the construct ceases to exist). By contrast, when Lumpkin and Dess
(1996) discussed EO, they described it as a multidimensional construct and one in which
a firm must only be high on “some” dimensions, but not necessarily high on any particular dimension. In essence, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) proposed EO as a different sort of
construct from that proposed by Miller (1983).
Thus, the research by Stetz et al. (2000) and Kreiser et al. (2002) should not be taken
as evidence that resolves the dimensionality debate—i.e., that Lumpkin and Dess (1996)
were correct about the multidimensionality of EO, whereas Miller (1983) was incorrect.
Miller, too, recognized that risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness would often be
manifested in organizations as distinct dimensions of behavior. He simply chose to not
label firms as entrepreneurial unless they were simultaneously risk taking, innovative,
and proactive. Lumpkin and Dess (1996), however, suggest that an “entrepreneurial” firm
(1) can be high on any of the five dimensions they proposed as constituting the conceptual domain of EO, (2) presumably must be high on at least one of these dimensions, and
(3) need not necessarily be high on any particular dimension. In short, the “debate” within
the entrepreneurship literature concerning the dimensionality of EO is somewhat misleading. Whether risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness can exist as distinct dimensions is not a point of disagreement.
Knowledge creation around the construct of EO should accelerate if the conversation within the literature shifts from the dimensionality debate to other theoretically
substantive issues. One such issue, for example, would be a conversation around the
matter of whether the study of EO will lose scholarly credibility if there are no necessary commonalities to phenomena that are regarded as manifestations of EO. If EO does
not necessarily imply “something”—be it risk taking, competitive aggressiveness, or
whatever—then what is the defining characteristic(s) of EO? Is it sufficiently precise to
suggest, á la Lumpkin and Dess (1996), that organizations exhibit an EO when any of
several dimensions of entrepreneurial activity are prominent in their behavioral patterns?
The question here is not whether EO can be reflected in a variety of behavioral phenomena. The question is whether all manifestations of EO, when conceptualized as a
firm’s profile on multiple entrepreneurial dimensions, must have at least one attribute in
common. On the other hand, is it unnecessarily limiting in a theoretical or methodological sense to restrict the label of “entrepreneurial” to firms that exhibit a single common
manifestation of entrepreneurial behavior—say, innovativeness—, or some particular
combination of manifestations, á la Miller (1983)? As implied by these questions, intellectual advancements pertaining to EO will likely occur as a function of how clearly and
completely scholars can delineate the pros and cons of alternative conceptualizations of
the EO construct and the conditions under which the alternative conceptualizations may
be appropriate.
In practice, the EO subdimensions of risk taking, innovation, and proactiveness tend
to exhibit moderate-to-high correlations with one another. For example, in Kreiser et al.’s
(2002) database, the correlation between risk taking and innovation was .44; the correlation between risk taking and proactiveness was .46; and the correlation between innovation and proactiveness was .49. In Tan’s (2002) database of 200 Chinese and American
firms, these correlations were .57, .62, and .67, respectively. In the current database, these
correlations are .57, .54, and .42, respectively. Such moderate-to-high average correlations between the dimensions of EO are consistent with the fact that the Miller/Covin
80

<-----Page 24----->and Slevin EO scale tends to exhibit high Cronbach alphas across samples. Thus,
empirically speaking, it is not wrong to employ the Miller/Covin and Slevin EO scale in
its entire, 9-item format. And, theoretically speaking, this “original” format is consistent
with Miller’s (1983) treatment of EO as a formative construct. Nonetheless, in the interests of discovering what an alternative operationalization of EO might reveal, the regression analyses in the current article were rerun with the individual subdimensions of EO
substituting for the overall 9-item scale. The analyses indicate that (1) risk taking (p <
.05) and proactiveness (p < .10) have positive main effects on firm sales growth rate; (2)
strategic decision-making participativeness negatively moderates the effects of risk taking
(p < .01) and proactiveness (p < .01) on firm sales growth rate; (3) strategy formation
mode negatively moderates the effects of risk taking (p < .05) and proactiveness (p < .05)
on firm sales growth rate; and (4) strategic learning from failure negatively moderates
the effects of risk taking (p < .01) and innovation (p < .01) on firm sales growth rate.
