The Cold, Hard, Truth by Kevin O’Leary

1

For more than two decades, not a day has gone by without a pitch.
In airports, in limos, in tea houses, even in an outhouse, total
strangers come up to me and pitch what they promise is “going to
be the best thing I ever saw!” So for more than two decades, not
a day has gone by without me having to tell some hard working
entrepreneur that their idea sucks.
The truth is that truly great ideas, ideas that lead to creative
destruction and change the world forever, are few and far
between. Over the last five years, I’ve probably heard more than
10,000 pitches (through O’Leary Funds, Shark Tank and Dragons’
Den). That is a lot of pitches folks. And truth be told, most of them
sucked. Yes, there have been some nice investments. But how many
were truly disruptive ideas? How many were truly game changing
opportunities? How many were ventures that led to huge returns?
Few. Great opportunities are few and far between.
It pains me to see good entrepreneurs chase bad opportunities.
After all, time, energy, bandwidth and, most of all, M-O-N-E-Y, are
all scarce resources. Today, there simply isn’t enough time, money,
or energy to pursue every idea. And that is a good thing. It leads
to evolutionary economics, where only the most agile survive and
only the best thrive. It is because of this scarcity, (scarcity in both
great opportunities and limited resources) one has to be extremely
careful of where one invests. That is true no matter what you invest:
money, time, or energy. It doesn’t matter if you are an investor
backing a Startup with seed capital or an R&D manager deciding

have to be picky.
As the Merchant of Truth, it is my duty to help hard working people
put down their rabid dog of an idea and move on. It is my duty to
hold them accountable to themselves. It is my duty to help them
see the folly of their ways.
Why? Because it pains me to see talented people wilfully blind
themselves to the flaws apparent to all. It hurts me to watch a
family go bankrupt because their business dreams have become an
entrepreneurial nightmare. It hurts me to see scarce resources like
seed capital squandered. For all those reasons, and so many more,
I help people find the winners and run away from the losers.
So how do you know which opportunities to back and which
opportunities to whack? How can you pick the ideas to go all in
on? You can find some of these answers in the pages that follow.
This book is a concise and accurate tool for opportunity evaluation.
It will explain how to separate the best from the rest. If you love
DRAGONS’ DEN and SHARK TANK, you will love this book. The advice
within will save you time, money and most of all, heartbreak.

Over the last ten years I have spent the majority of my time evaluating
entrepreneurial opportunities. First as Director of Ernst & Young’s
Venture Capital Advisory Group, then as a venture capitalist for a New
York-based private equity firm and most recently as the Industry Advisory
for the hit business reality show, Dragons’ Den (aka Shark Tank). I’ve
chaired the national venture conferences, judged dozens of business plan
competitions, and I have worked with over 15,000 entrepreneurs.
In total, I estimate that I’ve heard more than 10,000 pitches. As a result, I
have become very good at picking apart presentations, not based on their
delivery but on their flawed content. But there are only so many hours in
the day and for every pitch I am able to coach, there are dozens that get
lost in the process. I wrote this book hoping to share the tools I’ve created
with others.
Perhaps after using these tools investors will make better funding
decisions. Perhaps after reading this, entrepreneurs will be better
equipped to shape their ideas into opportunities. Perhaps after reading
this you will have a better understanding of why some opportunities fail
while others fly.
No matter who you are (entrepreneur, student or investor) I’m hoping
that you will enjoy reading this text and I hope even more that it will help
you make better decisions about where to invest your precious, scarce
resources (your time, your money, your mental bandwidth).
I’m always looking to upgrade this text with more examples. If you have
an example that you feel would be of value to include, please email me
directly. Should you have any questions, concerns or suggestions, please
feel free to contact me directly: sean.wise@ryerson.ca

The Process and Purpose of Opportunity Evaluation

<-----Page 16-----><-----Page 17----->It All Starts With the Idea
There is that magical moment in every entrepreneur’s life when a
flash of clarity and an amazing idea of how to solve one of our many
worldly problems pops into his or her head. Entrepreneurs often
have an interesting story to tell about this moment. But before you
jump off the couch and invest time and money into your venture,
every entrepreneur must ask, “Is there enough demand for this
product that people will people will pay for it?”
To answer this question, there are many factors that need to be
examined and the factors presented here will give some direction
as to how this question may be answered.
Consider the compelling unmet need: Does your product fulfill
someone’s need? How compelled is the customer to fulfill this
need? Is your product something they cannot live without, or is
it just a nice-to-have? Is it medication you need to lower blood
pressure or is it a cough candy for your sore throat? The greater the
pain your product solves, the greater the demand for it. The greater
the pain your product solves, the more you can charge for it.
Consider the case of the Startup product Gelfast2, a hygiene
dispenser that can be clipped to a doctor’s waist, allowing the
doctor to wash his or her hands between tending to each patient.
Therefore, Gelfast significantly reduces the rate of hospital acquired
infections. Without Gelfast, doctors would not wash their hands
as frequently as hygiene dispensers are typically placed in a fixed
location, such as down the hall from the examining rooms. Gelfast
is a great product idea and it has managed to gain interest from
the Dragons because the pain it solves is so great. Research shows
that in the United States, hospital acquired infections lead to over 2
million illnesses, 26,000 deaths and an added expenditure of over
$4.5 billion each year. This information helps the seller identify who
the potential customers might be.

<-----Page 18----->In Gelfast’s case it is not the doctors, but rather it is the hospital
administrators. As a hospital administrator, saving lives and money
would be very compelling reasons to buy Gelfast products.
It is not good enough that you think it’s a good idea, others need
to agree with you to such a degree that they’d be willing to pay for
it. When a great idea comes to you, ask others if it is something
they’d be willing to pay for, and if possible, ask experts in the
related industry for their opinions. Of course, many entrepreneurs
are afraid to share their idea with others for fear that it might be
stolen from them. To mitigate this risk, speak to only those who are
inside your network and those you can trust. Not only can these
people inform you on the quality of the idea but they can also help
you improve on the idea.
If it’s a good idea, chances are someone else is already doing it,
so the first thing you should do is perform an Internet search on
the idea to see if there is any existing competition or if there are
already potential substitutes. If you find anything similar, you must
take these competitors seriously. If you don’t, you may find yourself
in an unfortunate situation, just like the idea pitcher from ePawn
World. He wanted to take pawn shops online where people could
buy and sell items they would normally bring to a pawn shop, but
he did not take eBay or Craigslist seriously as competitors who have
already addressed this need.
Below are some ways to find an un-served need:
	
	

	
	
	
	

	
	
	
	

• Identify an irritation. Take traffic for example—if you

could find a way to significantly reduce traffic, many
governments would be willing to pay plenty of money for
your idea.
• Overcome an assumption, such as “garbage has no use or
value”. For example, find a use for sleeves that have been
taken off garments. Recycling companies take other
people’s trash for cheap and turn them into someone
else’s treasure— they sell junk at a profit.

• React to jealousy. WestJet and Porter airlines strive

to provide better customer service than the competition
and it works— both airlines have developed loyal
customers.
• Changes in technology. With the introduction of the
Internet, Amazon.com was able to build one of the
world’s largest bookstores without ever opening a “real”
bookstore.

When that brilliant idea pops in your head, remember it is only
worth investing your precious time and effort to turn the idea
into a real business if people are willing to pay their hard earned
money for it.

<-----Page 20-----><-----Page 21----->What is an opportunity?
At some time in your life you’ve had an entrepreneurial epiphany.
Suddenly your brain came up with an idea that could make your
rich. An idea that could change the world. An idea that could be
your opportunity for fame and fortune.
If you are Mark Zuckerberg that idea might have been Facebook.
If you are Elon Musk it might have been PayPal, or Tesla Motors or
even SpaceX.
In the annals of time, whenever there is problem or an unmet
need, people will try to fix it. These unmet needs are referred to in
academia as sub optimal solutions.
The telegraph was invented to address the fact that the postal
service was a sub optimal solution for rapid communication.
Airplanes fixed the suboptimal solution to long voyages by ship.
Facebook shifts the utility curve when it comes sharing information
amongst your friends and family.
But why are some ideas seen as opportunities while others are seen
as delusions? What makes an idea an opportunity?

Four Criteria of an Opportunity
All opportunities start with an idea. And while ideas are at the heart
of all opportunities3, for an idea to be seen as an opportunity, the
following four axioms4 must be true:
	1) The idea is durable: The idea is not a fad and will last long

	

enough to allow for monetization.
	2) The idea is timely: The market is ready to buy the solution
	
this idea encompasses.

<-----Page 22----->	3) The idea is attractive: The potential rewards and returns

	
	

on investment far exceed the foreseeable costs and
resources.
	4) The idea adds value: The idea must lead to a product or
	
service which creates or adds value for its buyer or end
	
user.

Where do opportunities come from?
This book is about opportunity evaluation not opportunity creation
and it is beyond the scope of this text to fully explore such.
Notwithstanding, the topic should be addressed briefly.
Any time a large population’s needs are unsatisfied, entrepreneurs
see opportunity. Whenever new technology opens up new
solutions, there is opportunity. Every demographic shift leads to
opportunity. If new discoveries lead to new possibilities, then they
also lead to opportunity.
At the heart of every opportunity lies an unmet need. In fact, the
larger the need (either by intensity or population) the quicker the
adoption.

<-----Page 23----->What is opportunity evaluation?
Sometimes one simply knows by intuition that a product or service
is bound for greatness. It doesn’t take a genius to know that the
human desire for sex would lead to huge sales of Viagra®. Likewise,
one can see the value of email in an ever shrinking globe. However,
unlike Viagra® and email, most opportunities are harder to
quantify—either because the market for such solutions is unknown
or because the idea is so radical.
Since our time, energy, bandwidth and capital are scarce, we have to
be able to differentiate the good opportunities from the bad ideas.
This is true no matter what role you play in the entrepreneurial
ecosystem:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

• Entrepreneurs have to choose which opportunity to
pursue.
• Investors have to choose which opportunities to fund.
• Government and NGOs need to decide which
opportunities are worthy of public resources.
• R&D managers have to decide which innovations to
explore.

Thus, opportunity evaluation is generally defined as the systematic
objective assessment of a venture’s potential. Please note that
the quantum of return (i.e., how much money you can make) is
not the only driving measure in opportunity evaluation. Investors
refer to the quantum of return as ROI, which stands for Return on
Investment and represents how much money (and other benefits)
will be generated by the investment. For example,
The ROI of a one year 3% government bond, is 3%. If you bought		
$1000 of bonds, you would receive $1030 at the end of the year
(your original investment plus 3%, or $30). Besides ROI there is
also the probability of success to take into account. After all, a
billion dollar idea that fails isn’t as good as a million dollar idea that
© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 24----->succeeds.

Who is this book for?
This book is for entrepreneurs trying to decide which idea to take to
market. This book is for business managers deciding which internal
projects to back. This book is for students watching Dragons’ Den or
Shark Tank who want to better understand the judges’ perspectives.
This book is for investors looking for a systematic and objective
review of funding opportunities. If you have ever had to look at two
opportunities and decide which one is more likely to succeed, this
book is for you.

Why measure at all?
Considering the degree of unknown factors (for example, uncertain
market, unproven demand and technical feasibility) involved in
opportunity evaluation, many students ask why measure at all?
After all, if most of the inputs are best guesses on future states
(e.g., what is the pro forma revenue projection for year 3?) how
reliable can the output be?
While the foregoing is true (most information used in opportunity
evaluation is estimated at best); it is equally true for all opportunities.
As a result, while not objectively valid (i.e., a high score does not
guarantee a high chance for success) the opportunity evaluation
process is internally valid. This allows us to compare two radically
different ideas (both enmeshed by uncertainty) with some
confidence. Or put another way, a high score doesn’t guarantee
a chance of success; it only predicts that opportunities with high
scores should outperform opportunities with low scores. To make
matters worse, there is no post facto way of confirming this as ideas
that score low aren’t pursued, making it impossible to know if they
would have succeeded.
Notwithstanding, this book is meant to provide readers with a
framework formally unknown to the general population. It is
designed to ensure that entrepreneurial enthusiasm isn’t driving

<-----Page 26-----><-----Page 27----->Where does Opportunity
Evaluation fit into the overall
entrepreneurship process?
Most attempts to model the entrepreneurial process (including
the famous Timmons Model5) note opportunity evaluation as
a key stage in the formulization of a new venture. Typically, it is
advisable to look before you leap, and evaluating an opportunity
before investing time and energy (and money!) is the best way
to do that. Below are two diagrams taken from the academic
literature that showcase the role of opportunity evaluation in the
entrepreneurship process.
Model 1: From “Formalizing the front-end of the entrepreneurial
process using the stage-gate model as a guide6,” by Barringer and
Gresock (2008) we see opportunity evaluation in stages 2 and 3
below.

Model 2: From Bolton & Thomson (2004), note Stage 3.

<-----Page 28----->What is the cost of poor Opportunity Evaluation?
According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor7 in 2010,
	 “Some 110 million people between 18–64 years old were
actively engaged in starting a business. Another 140 million
	 were running new businesses they started less than 3½
	 years earlier. Taken together, some 250 million were involved
	 in early-stage entrepreneurial activity.”
But how many were pursuing poor opportunities? How much time,
effort and money were tied up in bad ideas? How much do poor
opportunity evaluation cost us all?
There are opportunities around us each day. Some are good and
some are not. Most people fixate on the “opportunities missed.” In
over a decade of venture capital, I have heard statements like the
following dozens of times: “XYZ is a great business. I had the idea
for XYZ years earlier.”
The statement’s speaker will then go on to opine on how wealthy
they would be if they had pursued the idea for XYZ. The problem
of course is that success is measured post facto (after the fact).
So the inventor first sees that XYZ can succeed before seeing how
much money it could generate. This retroactively endorses the idea
without forcing the entrepreneur to act upon it. Put another way,
Mark Zuckerberg was not the first to explore Social Networks; but
now that it is a huge success, many people want to take credit for it.
But even the cost of “what could have been” is infinitesimally small
when compared to the resources squandered on bad ideas and the
costs associated with them.
If Mr. G spends all his time, energy, social capital, bandwidth and
money on idea Z. And if idea Z turns out to be a poor opportunity;
www.gemconsortium.org

Page 28 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 29----->then Mr. G is not only out all the time, energy, social capital
bandwidth and money he invested in idea Z but he also has an
additional Opportunity Cost.
According to Investorpedia.com8, Opportunity Cost represents:
	
	
	
	

1. The cost of an alternative that must be forgone in order 	
to pursue a certain action.
2. The benefits you could have received by taking an
alternative action.

For example, if an executive decides to go back to school to obtain
his MBA. here will be direct costs (tuition, school books, bus fare,
etc.) and there will be opportunity costs (salary not earned while in
school; work promotions not pursuing, etc.). In order to understand
the true cost of the MBA, one has to account for both direct costs
and opportunity costs.
Take Farmer Q for example. Farmer Q owns 100 acres of prime
agricultural land. Farmer Q has a choice; she can grow Carrots or
Potatoes (or some mixture). But if she grows carrots which later go
out of fashion (or there is a large oversupply of carrots produced)
driving the price of carrots down before she can sell her crop; then
not only will Famer Q loose the money invested in the carrots and
not only will she loose the revenue that those carrots would have
generated; but she also loses the money she could have made in
potatoes.
So what does poor opportunity evaluation cost us? Well, there is
the capital, energy, attention and passion that is wasted, but there
is also the opportunity cost. For every bad idea that moves forward
lowers the resources available for the better ones.
Venture capitalists invested $21.8 billion in 3,277 deals in 20109. In
the venture capital industry it is widely accepted that on average,
that only 1 in 100 pitches to a VC get funded. Based on this rule, we

<-----Page 30----->can see that if 3,200+ deals got funded, then at least 300,000+ pitches
did not get funding that year. Yet, of the 1000+ entrepreneurs who
pitched me personally in 2010, each enthusiastically proclaimed
their idea was the “best I would ever see!” So why the disconnect?
In three words: Poor Opportunity Evaluation.
In 2011, 61% of non-business owners say they want to start
a business10. Yet on average less than half of these ideas will
service 5 years. A third of them will be dead within 24 months.
If only entrepreneurs and inventors spent more time evaluating
opportunities and less time pitching them.
In the last decade I’ve heard over 10,000 pitches. Not one of them
thought there idea was weak. Tune into Shark Tank® or Dragons’
Den® any week and for every great idea you see, you will sell
half a dozen not so great ones. Yet before they enter the Tank (or
Den) each whole heartedly believes there idea is the best. If only
they weren’t so weak in opportunity evaluation they would save
themselves so much heartache, wasted time and lost capital.

<-----Page 31----->How to use this book
This book is meant to provide the reader with a formal, objective
tool to evaluation opportunities. Narcissistically, I’ve named this
tool the WiseGuide™ and you can see it in action online at:
www.USEtheWiseGuide.com
Following this introductory section, we will move directly into
defining and demonstrating how to score the 44 elements that
make up the WiseGuide™ scoring system.
In Part III we discuss potential pitfalls that can kill a great venture.
Even though we leave this discussion until after the 44 elements
are illustrated, in the “real world” opportunity evaluators typically
check for pitfalls first, and only upon finding none do they undertake
a more thorough review. Because of this, the framework presented
here follows a Stage-Gate model11 of decision making.
Part III is followed by a “Tool Kit” of the concepts in action. This
section is meant to illustrate how the elements come into play as
well as provide the reader with practical and grounded examples
from the real world.
For the most part, examples come from my work as a venture
capitalist and from my years of experience working with the
business reality show, Dragons’ Den (also known as Shark Tank).
We have also been blessed to have contributions from leaders
in opportunity evaluation. We have spread these short essays
throughout the text in the hope that their perspectives will help
round out readers’ opinions. These sections will be easy to spot, as
the author’s name is listed below the subsection.
Finally, knowing the issues with your opportunity is only the start

upgraded and evolved. Sometimes, an investor brings domain.
To help with this evolution process we have added, wherever
applicable, a section entitled Raising the Score.

How to gather the data needed
This text is not a guide to Due Diligence. It is not meant to cover all
the variables that need to be accounted for prior to commitment.
It is simply a starting point for opportunity evaluation. It is meant
to facilitate an exploratory conversation and to help opportunity
evaluators decide if more attention is warranted. As a result, external
references are not required. Third party evidence is required. Why?
All entrepreneurs think they have the next great thing, as a result
investors and other opportunity evaluators can’t rely on self-serving
statements. Instead, whenever possible, seek out third party, arms’
length information. What are your actual sales? What have your
potential clients said? Who else believes in the greatness of your
opportunity?

Quality of Evidence
The stronger the evidence presented, the higher the score. The
greater your ability to prove your assumptions using external
validation, the better the score. For example, sales are great but
sales to well-known brands are even better. Saying that your
product is needed is good but showing the rapid adoption of the
product is better.
To account for this in your assessment, give extra points for any
element that is presented with third party evidence (footnotes,
sales receipts, feedback from focus groups).

The Credibility Factor
When you Google your name, what hits do you see? Perhaps
that paper you wrote in university, maybe your LinkedIn profile,
Page 32 Hot or Not?

portray you in a positive light?
In any partnership “trust” is essential, and every investor wants to
ensure you’re truthful because, ultimately, they need to trust you
with their money. In the beginning, every investor will check over
two things:
	
1. Are the entrepreneur’s claims true?
	
2. The reputation of the entrepreneur
It’s difficult enough to build a business from scratch, imagine doing
that with a partner you can’t trust. With this in mind, entrepreneurs
must be completely honest with investors and only make claims
they can back up. Too often entrepreneurs turn into blowfish before
meet their investors. These are the entrepreneurs who to “inflate”
themselves moments before the presentation and over valuate
their companies, and the inflation always shows through.
Upholding the highest level of honesty and integrity and making
claims that you can back up ensures investors will perceive you as
credible. This credibility earns trust, convincing investors you will
use their money wisely.

How to use the WiseGuide™
At the back of this book and online at www.USEtheWiseGuide.com,
you will find a template worksheet for opportunity evaluation. It
has been broken down into eight categories and each category is
weighted. The weighting is based on feedback from more than 100
professional investors.
The eight categories cover the major areas reviewed in the
opportunity evaluation process are listed below:
	
	

• People a who is behind the project?
• Pain a what problem are you addressing?

<-----Page 34----->	
	
	
	
	
	
	

• Product a what solution do you offer?
• Province a to what market or industry are you selling?
• Pitch a how will you deliver a clear, two-minute overview?
• Plan a what is your go-to-market strategy?
• Proposal a what are you seeking to gain, what are you
willing to give?
• Pitfalls a what things should you avoid?

In each of these eight categories, there are several sub-elements.
Each will be rated by the reviewer. Ratings go from -10 (very bad) to
+10 (very good). In total there are 44 elements in the WiseGuide™.
Each element has a rating and that rating is multiplied based on
the importance and impact (5 for impactful, 3 for important, 1 for
average). The weighting is based on investor experience.
Weightings are based on the impact that each element may have on
an investment decision and may relate to investor capital, investor
time and so on. To represent these relative weights, I have assigned
a multiplier to each element based on categories:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

• People a 5x
• Pain a 5x
• Product a 3x
• Province a 3x
• Pitch a 1x
• Plan a 1x
• Proposal a 1x

<-----Page 35----->The result should be a number between -1340 and 1340.

What is a good score?
“Good” is a very subjective term. The top score possible on the
WiseGuide™ is 1340. For those who are extremely risk adverse you
would want your score to be no less than 1150 (85%). For those
who are more entrepreneurial in nature, no less than 810 (60%) or
more makes the opportunity worth pursuing.
However, I would caution against this type of thinking. Instead, look
for the opportunity in which you have a competitive advantage.
If you have deeper Domain Knowledge in opportunity 1 than
opportunity 2, it might be worth pursuing opportunity 1 even if it
has a lower overall WiseGuide™ score.
On a similar note, once you have generated an opportunity’s
WiseGuide™, revisit the lower scoring elements. Consider if you are
able to impact that score. Perhaps you find a partner with Business
Acumen, taking that key element from a -5 to a +10. Perhaps you
might be able to secure some IP, raising that element from a 0 to a
+5. In other words, don’t simply calculate the score and walk away.
Examine the scorecard with your partners and determine if any
elements could be improved.

<-----Page 36----->Same Opportunity, Different Scores
Two investors are unlikely to generate the same score, even for the
same opportunity pitched at the same time. The main reason for
this is that each reviewer has their own experiences that impact
their reception of the pitch. These differing experiences influence
how they perceive risk and in turn how they rate each element.
As a result, two reviewers may see the same facts, but perceive
them differently. Don’t be disturbed by this. The key is not to
have an absolute score but a relative. Is opportunity A better than
opportunity B? Is B better than C? Once again, this leads to internal
validity (I use the same experiences to judge each opportunity) but
scores will be different from reviewer to reviewer. This raises the
issue of bias.

Page 36 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 37----->The Issue of Bias
Opportunity evaluation is a highly subjective process. Each
reviewer will not only base a venture’s score on the information
presented by the founder, but each score will also be impacted by
the reviewer’s personal history, experience and bias. This last item
is of most concern. Biases can impact scores greatly, often creating
a blind spot that can be difficult to mitigate. It is thus important to
first assess oneself before assessing others.

Killer bias: Psychological traps that
catch entrepreneurs and investors
By Professor Dave Valliere, MEng MBA PhD PEng

There are all kinds of people who need to know how to spot a
great business idea. Some are entrepreneurs trying to decide
whether this is the opportunity they should put their heart and
soul into. Some are investors trying to discover the one that will
yield returns big enough to offset all the other dog investments
they’ve made. Some are potential employees, suppliers, business
partners, or intermediaries. Each has a different perspective and
different objective for the opportunity evaluation process. But all
operate with the same flawed human mind, trying to assess the
idea and potentially falling prey to the same common psychological
biases—the kinds of traps that catch everyone unless we are fully
aware of them and take steps to avoid them. The following are
four of the most pervasive psychological biases that often trick
both entrepreneurs and their investors into making bad decisions.
Decisions that can kill new ventures and wipe out investments.
Confirmation bias or, as it is sometimes known, wilful blindness
arises whenever we have formed a strongly held opinion or view
about something, particularly when we have made a big effort to
gather and analyze a lot of information before arriving at our opinion
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage–gate_model

11

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 37

<-----Page 38----->(exactly like when developing a business plan). There are two
dangerous effects that may result from confirmation bias. The first
is that reviewers become very attuned and receptive to information
that appears to support their opinions. For instance, they tend to
notice every newspaper article that can be interpreted to support
their belief. Reviewers who have fallen prey to confirmation bias
tend to view and accept as true every occurrence in the world that
can possibly be seen as an example of the phenomenon in which
they believe.
The second dangerous effect of confirmation bias is that reviewers
can become quite blind to information that appears to refute their
opinion. Reviewers suffering from confirmation bias often cease to
look for information that might contradict their preformed opinion
(why bother, since they “know” their opinions must be right).
Furthermore, if the world shoves the conflicting information into
their faces they find some way to rationalize it or deny it (they say
“yeah, but…,” and then find some trivial difference that allows
them to dismiss the contradictory evidence as an irrelevant “special
case”) rather than change their opinions (since that would mean
admitting we were wrong in the first place). It can suddenly seem
like confirming cases and examples are everywhere around us and
it can seem like no counterevidence exists. But this is an illusion –
the rates of occurrence and non-occurrence have not changed. It is
only our awareness and perception that has changed.
Because of this, entrepreneurs and other opportunity evaluators
should always attempt to remain flexible and open to the possibility
that their opinions and assumption may turn out to be false.
Opportunity evaluators should attempt to always remain humble
and receptive in the face of the reality that the marketplace will try
to teach them. They should make sure their assumptions are open
to being proved wrong.
But that’s often not enough, if these entrepreneurs don’t also take
active measures to counteract confirmation bias. And, of course,
investors face the same risks too (and are generally more difficult
Page 38 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 39----->to coach), once they’ve formed an opinion about whether a market
space is “hot” or not. Both groups need to take deliberate actions
to keep confirmation bias in check, such as deliberately seeking
out contradictory information or contrarian opinions from experts.
The real test of whether you have a good business idea is not your
ability to find information that says “yes,” but your inability to find
information that says “no”.
TIP: To avoid confirmation bias, spend your time trying to find
information that refutes your beliefs instead of more information
that supports them.
The next killer bias is over-confidence, which is having a belief in
one’s abilities that is greater than the objective facts warrant. While
it is good to have entrepreneurs who are highly talented and who
know it (confidence), entrepreneurs who are unable to recognize
the limits of their remarkable talent (over-confidence) can cause
real problems. But this is a particularly hard bias to detect in oneself,
since people who are over-confident in their abilities are usually
also over-confident in their self-awareness and ability to correct
for their own biases. Over-confidence is actually an umbrella term
that encompasses a group of related biases, including the planning
fallacy or “90/90 rule” (i.e., the first 90% of a project takes first 90%
of the budget, and the final 10% of the project takes the second
90% of the budget), and personal attribution error (i.e., if things
go right it’s because I’m so smart and skilled, but if things go wrong
it’s because someone else screwed up). All are examples of having
unreasonably high beliefs in oneself.
Psychometric tests of opportunity evaluators like entrepreneurs
and investors repeatedly show some amazingly high levels of overconfidence. This is a real cause for worry. These individuals are
highly confident and are perfectly right to feel that way since they
are highly skilled and able. In fact, one might argue that confidence
is a necessary trait for both entrepreneurs and investors. But, while
their abilities might well be 50% better than the average person,
they tend to think and act as if their abilities were 500% better.
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 39

<-----Page 40----->For entrepreneurs, this means they often think they can accomplish
much more than they can, and that their chances of succeeding in
a risky venture are much better than they are actually. The same
phenomenon holds for investors, who will be over-confident in
their abilities to pick winners and to add value to their investees
(i.e., make sure the investee firms become hugely successful).
There’s a real lesson in the observation that most VC funds have
a hit ratio of only 1-in-10 investees becoming successful. But most
VC investors are unable to learn from it because they are caught in
their own over-confidence.
TIP: To avoid overconfidence bias, make your decisions based on
objective data about what you actually have achieved in the past,
not what you subjectively think you should be able to do in future.
The third killer bias is availability bias, which is the mistaken belief
that situations that are easy for an individual to imagine must
therefore be very common out in the world (or the converse, that if
you’ve never personally seen a black swan they must not exist). But,
while this is seductive reasoning, it is false logic. It can be extremely
dangerous to generalize too widely from our own experience. Our
own experience is not typical and is not to be blindly trusted (after
all, everyone is abnormal is some way—it’s perfectly normal). With
proper perspective we can see that our own experience, while
a deep and vivid source of insight, is still just a dataset with n=1
as the sample size. One data point is hardly enough to use as the
foundation for an entire business strategy. Statisticians will remind
us that any sample with fewer than thirty responses will fail to
meet even the most basic assumptions of statistical inference. So
we sometimes try to guard against this bias by reminding ourselves
that the plural of “anecdote” is not “data”.
Entrepreneurs who are caught by this bias often exhibit “the market
is me” behaviours; they believe that if they like the proposed new
product, then thousands of other people are going to like it too. This
is a weird conclusion if you think it through. After all, we celebrate
entrepreneurs for being so unlike other people, for thinking and
Page 40 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 41----->seeing so differently than others, and for being willing to act where
other people would not. They are therefore not very suitable to use
as benchmarks for the marketplace.
Entrepreneurship educators may further compound the problem
by (correctly) telling prospective entrepreneurs to seek and exploit
opportunities in areas that they know well, where they have prior
knowledge and experience that gives them asymmetric information
and insight. We often encourage our students to leverage their
Domain Knowledge obtained from prior experience. This is all well
and good, but it does increase the potential for getting trapped by
availability bias. And of course, the exact same problem occurs on
the investor side of the table. In their case it often sounds something
like, “I heard that BigFundCo got a 10X exit in the cloud computing
space, so I’m going to invest in the next cloud deal that crosses
my desk”. This bias affects internal opportunity evaluators too. For
example, if one big company’s R&D produces a huge winner based
on crowdsourcing then R&D managers at other big companies tend
to jump on ship, pushing to add crowdsourcing to their repertoire
regardless of whether it was the actual cause of the initial success.
TIP: To avoid availability bias, keep reminding yourself that your
experience is unique and that there is no reason to think that it
corresponds to what real market data would say about the average
person.
The final killer bias to be wary of is an interesting phenomenon
described by prospect theory. Prospect theory explains three
interrelated biases. First, people give too much emotional weight
to small chances, thinking that a 1% chance is much better than
no chance at all and that a 99% chance is much worse than a sure
thing (the strength of this belief can be witnessed at any lottery
ticket kiosk). Secondly, people treat chances of winning something
much differently than they treat the chances of avoiding the loss
of something (for example, we usually have to offer the chance of
winning at least $250 to entice people to accept a chance of losing
$100). Thirdly, people judge these wins and losses not in absolute
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 41

<-----Page 42----->terms, but relative to where they expected to be or where they
told other people that they’d be (their reference or anchor point).
These biases combine to create a two-sided irrational phenomenon
that catches many people. On the one hand, if we are winning (or
even if we are losing, but not as badly as we expected to lose) we
tend to become overly conservative and reluctant to take sensible
or attractive gambles. We try to lock in our wins, thinking that a
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. On the other hand, if we
are losing (or even if we are winning, but not as grandly as we told
everyone we would) we tend to become reckless risk-takers who
throw “Hail Mary” passes in the slim hope that we can catch up
to where we “ought” to be. This phenomenon is the mechanism
that drives so-called escalating commitment, the throwing of good
money after bad in the hopes that the original losses can still be
somehow salvaged. This is based on the stubborn human refusal
to recognize that sunk costs are always irrelevant when making a
decision in the present moment. For example, an investor who has
watched his share price fall in a clearly doomed Startup company
will still be strongly biased to participate in any subsequent round
of funding in a futile attempt to keep the company alive for a bit
longer to avoid having to accept that the first round money is
irretrievably lost.
Prospect theory warns opportunity evaluators that they cannot
trust their gut instincts when assessing probabilities of success, and
that their perceptions will be strongly skewed by recent history. It
says that they must ignore the emotional perception that losses
sting them more than wins please them, and that they must be
particularly careful when publicly announcing targets (or even just
privately setting their hearts and expectations on them) lest they
become anchor points that will force them into irrational escalating
commitments. Investors may love entrepreneurs who set “kick-ass”
targets and (blinded by their over-confidence) loudly proclaim that
these BHAGs will be achieved or exceeded. But such acts come
with huge risks of becoming trapped in killer biases that will drive
bad decisions and destroy value.

Page 42 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 43----->TIP: To avoid escalating commitment biases arising from prospect
theory, use objective calculations to determine the expected
value of uncertain choices, and be very careful about the public
commitments you make.
Every day, everywhere around the world, opportunities are being
evaluated and significant resource commitments are being made.
Which Startups to fund? Which R&D projects to support? Which
founders to back? These are questions with enormous social and
economic consequences. Look around and you’ll see these killer
biases happening everywhere, including in yourself. And, although
you are now among the few people aware of them, remember that
they will still affect you unless you take concrete and deliberate
steps to avoid them. So remember to do the following whenever
you are evaluating opportunities:
	 1. Spend your time trying to find information that refutes 		
	 your beliefs, instead of more information that supports 		
	 them.
	 2. Make your decisions based on objective data about 		
what you actually have achieved in the past, not what
you subjectively think you should be able to do in future.
	 3. Keep reminding yourself that your experience is unique
	 and that there is no reason to think that it corresponds
to what real market data would say about the average
person.
	 4. Use objective calculations to determine the expected
value of uncertain choices, and be very careful about
the public commitments you make.

<-----Page 44-----><-----Page 45----->Why it all means
nothing in the end
The axiom “Garbage in, garbage out” comes to mind when I’m asked
if the WiseGuide™ method of Opportunity Evaluation is reliable and
accurate. Put bluntly, the scores generated by following this text are
only as accurate as the information provided by the entrepreneurs.
If the information they provide is incorrect or embellished or even
slightly biased, the score may be less reliable.
Further, scores obtained are not cross validated. For example,
two reviewers may evaluate the exact same opportunity, at the
exact same moment, and still end up with different scores. This
is a significant subjective element to this process. And while one
reviewer might think a company’s IP is worth +10 another may not.
Notwithstanding, the scores are internally valid, meaning that two
opportunities evaluated at the same time by the same person are
fully comparable. It is for this reason that the WiseGuide™ is most
useful when comparing different opportunities.
No matter how great the opportunity, in the end it is execution not
ideas that creates change and generates wealth.

Execution – What Really Matters!
Professor Steven A. Gedeon, PhD, MBA, PEng

Entrepreneurship is that fundamental spark of human initiative that
enables us to act and shape the world around us. It is about belief
in yourself, your ability to create positive change, and your capacity
to inspire others to join you in your great adventure. It is about
starting with nothing but your own mind and creating dramatic
new values that never previously existed. Entrepreneurship is the
most empowering, creative, freedom-loving power in the world.
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 45

<-----Page 46----->Entrepreneurship is more than a business discipline. It is a core way
of seeing, thinking and acting that is relevant to all disciplines, all
faculties, and all people.
Entrepreneurs don’t just see the world as it is, they see it as it can or
ought to be. And then they make it happen. Yes, entrepreneurs are
visionaries, inventors, planners, thinkers, dreamers and opportunity
spotters – but none of those matters if they are not also doers.
Entrepreneurship is about creating value. Value must be brought
forth into physical existence before it can be exchanged, sold or
used to earn a living. Even something as abstract as Intellectual
Property must be crystallized into a concrete form such as a
written document (patent), creative work of art (copyright), or logo
(trademark).
Execution is everything. An idea or a business plan has no value
on its own. Investors say that they invest in an A team with a B
plan over a B team with an A plan. Why? Because business plans
are wrong. Despite all the great analysis and planning, things will
go wrong. Sales may take longer, product development may take
longer, founders may leave, a competitor may enter the field – or
all these may happen at once. You just don’t know.
Stability for a new company is like stability on a motorcycle. When
the motorcycle is stationary or moving slowly it easily falls over and
seems to weigh a ton. It’s hard to get it back up again when it falls
or to push it when it’s not running. But at high speeds, its spinning
wheels act as gyroscopes to keep you upright. Barriers that seemed
insurmountable when you were pushing the bike up a hill become
slight bumps in the road at high speeds.
The faster you act, the more stable your company becomes and
the higher your chances of success. Perfectionists make lousy
entrepreneurs. Don’t waste time on the perfect business plan –
it’s probably wrong anyway. Don’t delay speaking to customers,
making sales or launching your product as you wait for the perfect

<-----Page 47----->moment. Get out there – now!
Initiative, passion and execution are the only things that you, the
entrepreneur, really have under your direct control. With that
in mind, here are a few specific “Principles of Entrepreneurial
Execution”:
• Be an Evangelist—Get out there and talk to everyone who
	 shows interest in your business including potential
	 customers, suppliers, employees, investors, friends and
	 peers. Don’t keep your idea a secret. Don’t disclose your
	 secret sauce of course, but if your idea or ability to execute
	 is so weak that others can steal it, then let them take it
	 and move on to something that you can execute better than
	others.
• Be a Skeptic—Don’t just talk—listen! Ask the hard questions
	 and don’t let people get away with telling you what they
	 think you want to hear. Don’t just hear the nice things
	 people say. Go deeper and keep asking questions until you
	 find something they don’t like or understand. You need to
	 tell people great things about your company, but don’t let
	 that blind you to the possibility that your company is not as
	 great as it could be.
•	Be an Examiner—Set, Measure and Track Goals—There are
	 more things in a business to keep track of than any single
	 human being can accomplish without a serious project
	 management mindset. Accordingly, you need to find a way
	 to track the goals that really matter and focus your team
	 on achieving them. You need to find a way to translate long	 term goals into daily action items. These goals have been
	 referred to as Key Business Screamers, Key Success Factors,
	 Milestones, and Targets. You need to make sure everyone is

Hot or Not? Page 47

<-----Page 48----->	 “singing from the same songbook” and project management
	 and goal-setting skills are essential for doing this.
• Tie Rewards to Performance—Align everyone in your
	 organization toward these key metrics. Don’t just pay people
	 for showing up and looking busy.
• Tie Organizational Structure to Strategy—Figure out what
	 each of your strategic value chain activities is and put an
	 executive in charge of each one so these key activities don’t
	 fall between the cracks. Don’t just have an organizational
	 structure that gives each founder a VP title with no
	 corresponding key activity. There is no need to use
	 traditional titles like VP Tech or VP Marketing simply due to
	 a lack of imagination.
• Question your Assumptions and Adapt—Most successful
	 companies make several major course corrections early in
	 their corporate lives. The chances of your business plan
	 being correct are very low—which means that you should
	 assume from the beginning that you will make major
	 changes to your product, team, and target market. Learning
	 entrepreneurs are successful entrepreneurs. As you get out
	 there and present your products and services to your
	 market, you should be learning and changing. If not, you are
	 probably staying a blind course and are destined to fail.
•	Be a Role Model—You, the entrepreneur, breathe life into
	 the company you create. Along with this breath of life, you
	 also instil into the company your values, passion, and work
	 ethic. The company culture is the culture that you create
	 through your habits and character. If you show up late, so will
	 your employees. If you can’t make and keep commitments,

neither will your company. In the early stages of a company,
you are the living personification of the character that your
company will become. Be a great person in order to lead a
great company.

<-----Page 50-----><-----Page 51----->How to practice evaluating
opportunities
Never before have so many people been so interested in
entrepreneurship. Today, entrepreneurs are the rock stars of the
21st century economy. Opportunity Evaluation is an experientially
based skill that requires repetition and use in order to be fully
understood.
Each week on millions of television sets around the world, there
is a television show which broadcasts the ups, the downs and the
passion involved in entrepreneurial innovation. In the USA the
show is called Shark Tank. In the Czech Republic it is called Den D.
In Afghanistan, it is called Fikr wa Talash. In several Arab countries,
Al Aareen. In Israel, Hakrishim. But In Canada, the UK, Finland and
in more than a dozen other countries it is called Dragons’ Den. No
matter what it is called, millions around the world have followed
the call of entrepreneurship as a result of watching the show.
I spent five years as the Industry Advisor and Online Host for
Dragons’ Den. Through the show, I had the chance to evaluate
thousands of entrepreneurial opportunities. I have seen the best. I
have seen the worst. It is from these experiences along with decade
of venture capital that I have based this text.
Each week the hour long show features Startup entrepreneurs
seeking investment from financially successful judges. Each week
the highs and lows of entrepreneurship are featured as the all-star
business panel judges each opportunity, screening for the best.
Most of the shows are now available online. By watching even a
few hours of pitches, even the most novice opportunity evaluator
will find themselves applying the very theories and criteria outlined
in this book to judge the merits of each. So tune in, judge along and
learn just what it takes for an idea to go from concept to capital.

<-----Page 52-----><-----Page 53----->A few words about Risk,
Uncertainty & Ambiguity
There are important but subtle differences between risk, uncertainty
and ambiguity. Risk occurs when actions (or inaction) may lead to
loss. Risk deals with a future state that may be negative. Risk is
perceived as being quantifiable. In contrast, deals with future states
that cannot be known and cannot be predicted nor quantified.
Ambiguity relates knowledge which is unclear. Entrepreneurs face
risk, uncertainty and ambiguity on a daily basis.
Risks can be mitigated. The risk of commodity prices rising, can be
mitigated by buying large quantities of the commodity in advance.
Unlike risk, uncertainty can only be addressed in the fullness of
time. Ambiguity, unlike uncertainty, can be addressed by through
proper and full investigation. With that in mind, let’s discuss how
investors and opportunity evaluators measure risk.
Many entrepreneurs forget that investors are in the business of
saying no. Almost 99% of pitches fail to meet the minimum to attract
investor interest. Professional investors (e.g., venture capitalists)
are in the business of generating returns from a portfolio approach
(e.g., they invest in many, but reap rewards from few). For most
investors, analyzing risk is as important as exploring potential
returns.
Risk can be classified into three overreaching categories: market
risk, magic risk and management risk.
Market Risk asks: If you build it, will they come? If you make a
product that addresses a pain point, will the market respond?
Market Risk is most easily addressed through sales.
Magic Risk asks: If you build it, will it be 10x better? Can
your innovation address market needs in such a way as

addressed by third party’s arm’s length comparative report.
Management Risk asks: Is this the best team to back? Do
they have a full Talent Triangle in place? Has the team “Been
there, done that”? Management’s track record helps address
management risk.
There is no way to avoid risk. In fact, it is risk that leads to
opportunity. As a result of this inalienable fact, those pitching
innovations should not only explicitly recognize key risks but outline
how those risks will be mitigated. Innovators should focus on those
risks specific to their venture or concept and avoid mentioning the
risks that all opportunities face. Here are a few risks that ALL new
innovations must overcome, opportunity evaluators accept these
risks as present always and thus need not be referenced.
For example:
All innovations must attract early adopters, and there is
always a risk that this won’t happen. Therefore don’t include
this risk.
Wikipedia faced a risk that consumers of encyclopaedic
information were also willing to edit and create such
information for the benefit of others. This risk is specific to
Wikipedia and therefore should be addressed, perhaps with
evidence.
To mitigate risk, many investors seek proof of concept before
investing. Before 2000, proof of concept was often defined as:
I turn on the light, and the light goes on, thus the technology
worked. Today, proof of concept has evolved and many Angels (and
Dragons) want to ensure that not only that the light goes on but
also that someone will pay to read under the light.

Elements

Hot or Not? Page 57

<-----Page 58----->Introduction
The following sections detail 44 different criteria (elements) that
make up an opportunity evaluation using the WiseGuide™ system.
Elements are grouped into categories (e.g., People, Pain, Product,
etc.) and each category is weighted (for example, People is worth
more than Plan).
During a pitch, opportunity evaluators should keep track of which
elements have been addressed and ask follow up questions about
the elements not mentioned.
For each element, the reviewer will first need to decide the relative
strength of the item. Strength runs along a continuum:
•	-10.......very bad, undermines the opportunity
•	-5.........poor, but not the worse it could be
•	0..........not applicable or neutral
•	+5........this element benefits the opportunity
•	+10......best of the best
The scores should be tracked using the WiseGuide™ template found
in Schedule B of Part III of this text. Once all elements are scored
and weighted, they should be aggregated and compared to other
historical scores the reviewer has previously studied.

<-----Page 59----->People
A decade ago, I ran a survey for the accounting firm Ernst & Young.
I asked Startup investors to weigh various elements used in their
investment decision process. By far the most important of all the
categories is PEOPLE. People elements make up 40% of the overall
decision matrix. That is why you often hear investors quote mantras
like:
•	Bet on the jockey, not the horse.
•	An A team with a B idea beats a B team with an A idea.
•	PEOPLE is to opportunity, as PLACE is to real estate.
The reasons for this are obvious: people execute. Without people
to drive the business, all you have is a good idea. Further reasons
for weighing PEOPLE elements disproportionately include the
fact that while most elements evolve (markets change, products
advance) over time, people are the hardest elements to change and
are often the slowest to evolve. While it is true that most investors
include Management Controls (e.g., investors can fire the CEO)
most investors are averse to changing the business’s founders.
The People category can be broken down into a number of elements.
These elements may represent both skills sought by investors (e.g.,
Business Acumen) or attributes historically proven to increase the
probability of a venture’s success (e.g., Coachable).

<-----Page 60-----><-----Page 61----->Element 1: Working on it Full Time
What is it?
Count the number of people who are working (paid or unpaid) on
the opportunity.

Why it matters?
Ideas don’t count, execution counts and execution requires focused
founders. If no one is working on this opportunity full time, how
will it progress? The more people who are working full time (or
who are “all in”) the more confidence investors will have. After
all, if founders won’t take the risk and quit their jobs, why would
investors take the risk and fund it?

Questions to ask
How many team members work on this venture full time? How long
have they been at it? Why aren’t more people focused on this full
time if it is so great? Why haven’t you gone “all in”?

How to score this element:
Score this opportunity a:
•	-10 if …no one is working on the project full time.
•	-5 if …the founders are willing to quit after funding.
•	0 if …one founder is working full time.
•	5 if …all founders are working full time for pay.
•	10 if …all founders working on it full time for free.

Hot or Not? Page 61

<-----Page 62----->Raising the Score
This element is all about commitment. If you aren’t able to work
on the venture full time, how else might you show commitment?
Would a pledge to join the venture full time post funding raise the
score? Perhaps, but the more the idea’s proponents show real
commitment (money, time opportunity cost). To raise this score,
show what the idea’s champions have sacrificed to bring the
opportunity to light.

<-----Page 63----->Element 2: Been There: Done That
What is it?
All opportunities have some similarities (for example, raising
capital, filing taxes, hiring staff) and mistakes made in the past often
serve to lessen the mistakes made in the future. Note that not all
experience is weighted equally. The most valuable experience comes
from leading a Startup through a successful exit (for example, the
founder’s prior Startup was a success) but all experience (including
from a failed Startup) counts.

Why it matters?
Many investors say, “I don’t want founders learning on my dime.”
meaning that a serial entrepreneur is always easier to back than a de
novo entrepreneur since their experience increases the probability
of success. Other reasons why serial entrepreneurs are often seen
as better bets include: more realistic projections and timelines;
better access to resources including capital; and more seasoned
judgement. It may also be a result of better selection (for example,
serial entrepreneurs are able pick better opportunities to pursue,
as was found in 2010 by a team of researchers at Harvard14).

Examples in action
A Startup scoring high on this element will have founders who are
serial entrepreneurs, preferably with at least one strong exit to
date.

Questions to ask
On your team, how many have been in Startups before? What
happened to those ventures? What did your team do before this
opportunity?
© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 64----->How to score this element:
The more Startup experience the higher this element will score.
Score this opportunity a:
•	-10 if …founders have no prior Startup experience.
•	-5 if …one founder has some minor Startup experience.
•	0 if …one founder has Startup experience.
•	5 if …all founders have Startup experience, but none has
had a successful exit.
•	10 if …all founders are serial entrepreneurs with successful
exits.

<-----Page 65----->Element 3: Coachable
What is it?
Entrepreneurs need thick skin and resilient egos. Without both,
founders would not be able to endure the ups and downs of Startup
life. All Startups need exuberant passion and stoic dedication. After
all, anything new (products, software, solutions) is difficult to get to
market. Without perseverance and confidence a Startup wouldn’t
survive its first year. Often all a founder has at 4 a.m. is his or her
passion. But too much passion can lead to overconfidence and
Wilful Blindness.
Take the pitch for Pristine Cart, a product that sanitizes shopping
carts. The idea was flawed because the cost of the solution far
outweighed the benefit generated to the person paying for such
costs (i.e., the grocery store pays but the benefit is to the customers).
The entrepreneur simply refused to acknowledge this fact, even
after hearing it from several potential customers. The unfortunate
part is that the entrepreneur had already invested $120k into the
product, and the investors not only refused to invest, instead they
spent most of the time trying to convince the entrepreneur to stop
pursuing the business.
The ideal founder has enough confidence in her idea to actively
seek out criticism and feedback. After all, a solid innovator knows
it is through such feedback that one can spot and address early
potential points of resistance. Coachability refers to the founder’s
openness to external review, questioning and advice.

Why it matters?
Investors, particularly Startup investors, consider themselves to be
Smart Money. As a result they wish to contribute more than just
capital to a venture. They wish to add in their mentorship, their
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 65

<-----Page 66----->network and, most of all, the lessons learned from experience. For
these reasons, investors want to back entrepreneurs who listen as
much as talk. Further, they want to fund founders who not only
listen to them, but also listen to the market.
Startups change. No business idea ends where it started. In fact,
many of the most successful new ventures started elsewhere. Take
Viagra™ for example.
Originally developed by Pfizer as a heart medication, Viagra™
quickly became a solution for treating erectile dysfunction. Viagra™
has since become one of the bestselling pharmaceutical products
in the world (with more than a billion dollars a year in annual sales,
this drug became one of the fastest adopted products in history).
Now what would have happened if the intrapreneurs at Pfizer
hadn’t listened to feedback? Might they still be pushing a hard to
sell heart medication?

Examples in action
How many team members work on this venture full time? How long
have they been at it? Why aren’t more people focused on this full
time if it is so great? Why haven’t you gone “all in”?
A founder who is coachable will demonstrate such almost
immediately. All a reviewer must do is ask a contrarian question
such as, “I’m concerned about Google, why don’t you think they
are a threat?” and see how the founders react. If the entrepreneurs
lead with…”Google has no idea how to innovate…” it may be a sign
that their ego is impacting their judgement.
Here are some other questions I have seen used to test the
coachability of a founder:
1. Where do you see yourself in the company in 3 years?
	 i. Bad Answer: Leading the company, I’m the only CEO we
	 will ever need.
Page 66 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 67----->	 ii. Good Answer: Wherever the company needs me.
2. Who on your team knows more than you?
	 i. Bad Answer: No one.
	 ii. Good Answer: Everyone, I always surround myself with
	 those with skills I lack.
3. Would you rather be rich or famous?
	 i. Bad Answer: Famous. I deserve it.
	 ii. Good Answer: Rich, my primary concern is the return on 	
	 investment that all stakeholders will receive for
	 contributing to our success.

Questions to ask
How do you determine your strategy? With whom, outside the
company, do you regularly speak? What role would you ideally
want an investor or board member to play?

How to score this element:
Many investors attempt to gauge the coachability of Startup
founders. Give founders that resist all input or who think that they
know it all a -10. Give founders who are already actively seeking
contrary opinions and leverage such for positive change a +10.
Assign a 0 if this element never arose during the opportunity
review. Score this element with a -5 if the founders acknowledge
the need for coaching, but have not yet acquired such. Give this
element a +5 if a mentor or coach is involved, but not leveraged
fully (for example, having a board of advisors is good, but only if
they meet regularly with the founders).

Raising the Score
Having a mentor in place before you pitch is a good way to raise
an opportunity’s score. Similarly, being able to put together a
dedicated advisory board (one you meet with regularly) speaks
volumes to your coachability and can thus also help raise the score.

<-----Page 68-----><-----Page 69----->Element 4: Ability to Attract Talent
What is it?
My team once did a survey that showed that more than 60% of
an investor’s decision to invest was based on management, which
begs the question, What do investors look for when it comes to
management? Well, every investor is different, one investor might
focus on the entrepreneur’s passion while another might focus
on the founder’s experience, and yet another financier might
focus on the entrepreneur’s weak spots, hoping that alongside
their investment the investor might be able to help address that
weakness. Notwithstanding, one thing is true for most, if not
all, early stage investors—it all comes down to MANAGEMENT,
MANGEMENT, MANAGEMENT.
Venture Capitalists often talk about the well rounded management
team. Venture capitalists will look at the entire leadership team,
not just the person pitching the deal, to evaluate both its skills and
experience. Typically, investors look for what is sometimes called
the Talent Triangle. The Talent Triangle is a meme that says there
are three distinct sets of skills needed for a Startup to succeed:
Business Acumen, Domain Knowledge and operational experience.
Like change, another constant for most Startup opportunities is
the fact that they are all under-resourced. I’ve never met a Startup
that has all the resources (capital, people, IP) it needed to succeed.
Often, Startups raise capital from investors to address the fact that
they need to acquire more resources. The ability to attract assets
(including Talent) away from other opportunities invests confidence
in potential investors. After all, these resources understand the
industry better than the investor, if they are willing to commit,
perhaps so should the investor.
Basically, you are looking to explore Opportunity Cost as an objective
piece of third party validation. If the founders all sacrificed high
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 69

<-----Page 70----->paying jobs to join this Startup, investors may want to find out why.
Or, more often, it is framed in the negative: if this opportunity was
so good, how come no one has quit their job to work on it full time?

Why it matters?
The most important resource is of course human capital. The ability
to attract talent to join your Startup is a key skill. If a founder can
show success in attracting a new team member by stealing them
away from their current position, then investors will gain confidence
in the opportunity. Imagine you are able to hire away the VP of Sales
from Facebook. Doing so will imply that your opportunity is better
than Facebook, and that’s something that catches the attention of
seasoned investors.

Examples in action
A Startup who has already attracted a high-powered founder away
from a seemingly better opportunity will score high on this element.

Questions to ask
How did the staff come together? Did anyone leave a well-paying
job to work on this? If the founders weren’t hard at work on this
venture, what would they be doing?

How to score this element:
Score this element a +10 if the Startup team has already shown an
ability to attract top talent away from other opportunities. Score
this element a 0 if the Startup claims, “key management will join
after funding.” Score this element -10 if the founders have failed
to attract any talent to commit full time to the project. After all, if
key people (those more knowledgeable about the industry) won’t
commit to the opportunity, would an investor?

<-----Page 71----->Element 5: Business Acumen
What is it?
A survey I conducted years ago15 showed that it takes a well-balanced
management team to run a successful Startup. This team is made
up of three elements: Business Acumen, Domain Knowledge and
Operational Experience, collectively and colloquially referred to as
the Talent Triangle.
The first corner of the Talent Triangle is Business Acumen. Business
Acumen, which is typically found in the CEO, COO, and CFO of a
company, refers to the team’s experience and skills executing
business operations (for example, payroll, hiring, tax credits,
office rental, etc.). Business Acumen refers to the ability to run
the business. Do they know how to budget, to forecast, to lead, to
plan? In larger companies Business Acumen will be represented by
the CEO or COO of a business.
A founder with Business Acumen will have spent several years doing
business at a Startup level (as a lawyer, as a CFO, or as a founder).
Business Acumen is leveraged by a Startup to determine: how much
money to raise? Where to file intellectual property. How and when
to hire staff. How and when to scale.
Let’s take an easy example, Grocery Gateway16. Grocery Gateway
is an online delivery service for groceries. The Business Domain
member of the team at Grocery Gateway would be in charge of
trademarking the name, hiring the warehouse staff and raising
venture capital. Why does it matter?
Without Business Acumen an opportunity will founder. Companies
that run out of capital before realization may be weak in Business
Acumen. Business acumen is the result of years of business

<-----Page 72----->experience. It is typically stage-, not domain, centric (i.e., meaning
it is less important for Business Acumen to have working in the
industry than it is to have worked at a Startup).
Wise entrepreneurs recognize their weaknesses and realize that
they are not just asking for money, but also asking for business
expertise. A perfect example is David Koetsch, inventor of Grow
Zorb17.
Koetsch is a design engineer and came seeking funding fully
understanding his product, his customers and his competition.
It was clear to investors that David has Domain Knowledge and
operational experience, but lacks Business Acumen. David even
mentions in his pitch that part of the reason he is there is to seek out
a partner with business knowledge. When funders finally agreed to
invest, one of their conditions of the deal was, “We need a person
who can run the business in hand, so we’ve got to develop that
person as quickly as possible.” Every business needs the three key
elements in the Talent Triangle to be successful. As an entrepreneur
you need to be fully aware of any weakness in the Talent Triangle,
and fix any weakness as soon as possible.

Examples in action
Startup Founder Mr. A has spent ten years as CFO of various
Startups. Mr. A is able to answer the business questions raised in
the pitch (for example, what is your Break Even point?).
At Amazon.com, the founder with Business Acumen would have
been responsible for naming the company, filing the trademarks,
acquiring the office space, raising seed capital, etc.

<-----Page 74-----><-----Page 75----->Element 6: Domain Knowledge
What is it?
The second corner of the Talent Triangle is Domain Knowledge.
Domain Knowledge is obtained by working in an industry. Domain
Knowledge is about knowing your customer and your industry.
Does management understand what their customer wants? Do
they know how their customer buys? Do they understand what
features and benefits are most important to their end user?
Domain Knowledge also deals with understanding one’s industry.
If your Startup was a grocery store, Domain Knowledge would not
only help you to sell the food on your shelves, but also how to get
that food onto the shelves in the first place.
If you want to run a Startup that revolutionizes banking, Domain
Knowledge would come in the form of years of experience working
in the financial sector, preferably in banking. The belief behind this
element is that in order to implement change, one must have inside
knowledge.
A person who is the former COO of Bank of America would be
seen to have strong Domain Knowledge at a software firm trying
to revolutionize the back end processing of electronic banking
transfers.
Domain Knowledge is necessary to understand client needs. Domain
Knowledge is needed to fully grasp the sub optimal solution which
is generating the opportunity. Domain Knowledge can also help
identify and attract key resources and talent as well as help ensure
the Startup’s go-to-market plan is reasonable and realistic.
At Grocery Gateway, the person who understands not only where
to get the food from, but also explicitly understands the end user’s
needs will cover the Domain Knowledge corner of the Talent
Triangle.

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 75

<-----Page 76----->Why it matters?
Without Domain Knowledge, Startups are likely to build a solution
that no one wants. Worse yet, without Domain Knowledge many
Startups oversimplify their problem analysis and may attempt to
solve problems that not a concern to industry end users. Without
Domain Knowledge, customer needs and industry hurdles may be
under-addressed.
TIP: To increase Domain Knowledge, consider forming a BLUE
RIBBON PANEL of your future clients. Work with them to test your
assumption.

Examples in action
Mr. B spent two decades in the wireless payment industry, most
recently as VP of a National Bank. He knows what clients want. He
knows the industry’s fatal flaws and he sees an opportunity. Mr.
B brings Domain Knowledge to Startups in the wireless payment
industry.
At Amazon.com a founder with Domain Knowledge would
understand the book industry and understand how customers
acquire books.

Questions to ask
Who on the team has worked in this industry before? What
connections does the management have to the industry? On what
did you base your assessment of the client’s Pain Point? Which
future clients have you run this idea by?

<-----Page 77----->How to score this element:

<-----Page 78-----><-----Page 79----->Element 7: Operational Experience
What is it?
The third corner of the Talent Triangle is Operational Experience.
Entrepreneurs in this corner know how to make and deliver the
solution to the customer. In an online grocery store, this corner
would supervise not only the creation of the e-commerce front end
website, but also the delivery of the food on the back end. This role
is usually filled by the CTO or COO.
Operational Experience is all about getting the product from design
to delivery. The Domain Knowledge informs you of what features
are most important, but the operational experience people know
how to not only build it, but they know how to get it into the market.
Operational experience is needed to deliver the solution. This corner
of the Talent Triangle actually builds and ships things. Operational
Experience can only come from doing. At online bookstore Amazon.
com, operational experience not only helps them build the web
store that sells the books, but also understands how to get those
books into the purchaser’s hands. If that sounds like a lot, that is
because it most certainly is.
Entrepreneurs who have delivered similar solutions to different
industries would score high on this element. A founder with
Operational Experience will have knowledge on how to not only
build the product, but also will understand what it will take to get
the product, service or solution into the hands of end users. At
Grocery Gateway the Operations Expert will know not only how to
accept food orders online, but also how to take electronic payments
securely and will also be responsible for determining how many
trucks are needed each day.

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 79

<-----Page 80----->Why it matters?
Without Operational Experience, founders may never launch. Or
worse yet, they may launch but may fail to deliver on their promises.
A great product is only great if it reaches the end users.
TIP: To increase Operational Experience, founders should join a
trade association or industry group. In many cities, Startup CFOs
participate in a quarterly roundtables hosted by one of the “Big 4”
accounting firms. Similar associations exist for many Startup roles
and even more exist for industry (for example, IT, healthcare). By
participating in knowledge transfer with peers, a founder can often
get context on their present situation and they can even discover
solutions.

Examples in action
Mrs. C has worked in software for many years. She can write relevant
code with her eyes closed. Having Mrs. C involved in a software
Startup would add operational experience.
At Amazon.com the operational experience corner of the Talent
Triangle would not only be responsible for the website but also for
the shipping and distribution.

Questions to ask
Who on the team has created and sold similar solutions before? Do
you have all the parts you need (resources, people, etc.) to bring
your product to market? If not, what remains outstanding?

Page 80 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 81----->How to score this element:
Score this opportunity a:
•	-10 if …the team has no operational experience and feels it
	 needs none.
•	-5 if …the team has no operational experience.
•	0 if …at least one founder has some experience building
	 similar solutions.
•	5 if …at least one founder has built and delivered similar
	products.
•	10 if …the solution has been successfully created sold and
	 delivered to customers.

How to score this element:
If your team lacks Operational Experience and you want to raise
the score of this element, you need to bring on staff that has
historically built similar products. The ability to build and deliver
your product to end users is not something your venture can do
without. Operational Experience is not something you can rely on
outside advisors for. E.g. if you are building an app for Apple’s iPad®,
you really do need a founder who knows how to code such

<-----Page 82-----><-----Page 83----->Element 8: Board of
Directors/Advisors
What is it?
Often the Catch 22 of Entrepreneurship (i.e., To raise money you
need a top team but in order to have a top team you need capital)
prevents a Startup from attracting top talent full time. This can
leave the Startup’s Talent Triangle unfulfilled. In order to address
weaknesses in management teams, I recommend recruiting a grade
A Board.
A good Board serves many purposes. A good Board:
•	Provides a sounding board for founders;
•	Provides Arms’ Length review;
•	Expands the network resources available; and
•	Expands leadership bandwidth and experience.
•	Signals to the world that your venture is worth supporting.
This last point, signalling, is worth exploring further. In economics,
Signalling Theory19 is the idea that one party credibly conveys
some information about itself to another party. By adding top
calibre individuals to your Board, you signal that the venture is
worth supporting. When Meg Whitman, the chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard and the former chief executive of eBay, joined the
Board of Zaarly, a Startup connecting errands with those available
to undertake them signalled the market that it was an important
venture. After all, most assume Whitman, who led eBay into a
worldwide ecommerce success story, knows something about
Zaarly’s province (i.e., industry) and by joining the ventures she is
endorsing such.

<-----Page 84----->Boards generally come in two flavours: Boards of Directors and
Boards of Advisors. The main differences between the two are
formality and liability. A Board of Directors is elected by the
Shareholders. Directors are collectively empowered to supervise
the company. The CEO of a Startup (even a founder) reports to and
serves the Board of Directors. Directors can also be liable and held
responsible for certain actions of the company. Contrast that with
a Board of Advisors.
Advisors can play a similar role to Directors, but without the liability.
Smart founders will audit their Talent Triangle, identify weak corners
and augment such by attracting those skills to the Startups Boards.
In that way, good board members serve to help break the Catch 22
of Entrepreneurship by giving the venture access to talent that it
could not afford. But the value of Boards doesn’t stop there.

Why it matters?
Startup success is extremely difficult. Uncertainty, Lack of Resources,
and an ever changing landscape can make for long odds on
entrepreneurial success. Adding seasoned business veterans to the
mix can enhance the overall probability of venture success.
Investors often want to see Boards in place prior to large amounts
of funding being invested. In addition to the reasons above, this is
to ensure that the founders are prepared to undertake and abide by
board supervision. Having Boards in place reassures investors that
the founders are coachable (see Element 3).
TIP: If your Talent Triangle lacks Business Acumen, add Board
members who have years of business experience, preferably at the
Startup stage. If your Talent Triangle is weak on Domain Knowledge,
enlist industry experts to your Board. If Operational Experience is
weak, then look to those who have delivered similar products to
similar customers to join your Board.

Do you have a formal Board of Directors in place? Do you have
advisors or mentors? How often do you meet?

How to score this element:
Better Boards score higher. The more formal and established the
relationships are, the higher the score.
Score this opportunity a:
•	-10 if …the team has no external support.
•	-5 if …the team is aware of the need for Boards.
•	0 if …the founders have some advisors but nothing
	 formalized.
•	5 if …advisor and mentor boards are in place meet regularly.
•	10 if …the Startup has both Advisors and a formal Board of
	 Directors that meet regularly.

Raising the Score
Joining a Board of Directors often incurs liability for the person who
joins. For this reason, many opportunity supporters prefer to be
on the Board of Advisors (which is informal and brings no liability)
instead of the Board of Directors. If your venture lacks a formal
Board, then you should establish a Board of Advisors to raise this
element’s score.

<-----Page 86-----><-----Page 87----->Element 9: Social Capital
What is it?
Social networks are made up of the connections in your life (for
example, work, personal, school). Social Capital refers to the goodwill
trapped inside an entrepreneur’s social network. Entrepreneurs
with high levels of social capital will be able to “call in favours” to
acquire resources and opportunities for the Startup. As discussed,
Startups never have enough capital to gather the resources they
require. Even if they do have the money, it may not be enough to
convince a reporter to cover the story or a customer to allow a pilot
or trial run of the solution. Social Capital allows entrepreneurs to
leverage their position in the industry/community to the benefit of
the Startup.

Why it matters?
In the 21st Century, there is growing literature around the concept
of social networks. In the last few decades this literature has
explored the benefits and uses of social networks. Most famous of
all is the work of Granovetter20. Mark Granovetter was interested in
how social networks impact job hunting.
In exploring job opportunities and their origins, Granovetter found
the majority of job leads came not from your friends and family
(e.g., your strong ties) but from friends of your friends (e.g., you
weak ties). This became known as the Strength of Weak Ties Theory.
This theory argues that you and your friends and family have access
to similar information, while weak ties have access to knowledge
outside of your social network.

<-----Page 88----->Entrepreneurs who act as social network hubs with lots of weak
connections (who bring in new information) and many strong
connections (which can help execute on that information and
which can help signal success), have a greater ability to obtain key
resources (e.g., talent, opportunity, etc.)21. Investors tend to back
those founders with a proven track record of being able to leverage
social capital through social networks.
Investors like to back founders who are Known and In the Know.
By Known, I mean recognized in the industry. Entrepreneurs whose
reputation for success precedes them are seen by investors as
having large reserves of Social Capital that you can leverage. Think:
•	Donald Trump for Real Estate;
•	Elon Musk for Transportation; or
•	Jim Treliving for Food Franchise.
Having a member of your Startup who is Known will not only lead to
better media attention (which is cheaper than advertising) but will
also increase how others (clients, investors, future employees) view
the Startup. If your real estate software Startup attracts Donald
Trump to its Board of Directors, others may look at your venture
positively based on this point alone. The logic behind this benefit
goes like this:
1. Trump Knows how to make money in Real Estate;
2. This Startup has no proof of concept, but
3. If Trump thinks it is worth his time, perhaps it is worth
	 mine?
Being In the Know is slightly different. Being in the Know is a form
of Domain Knowledge. Knowing the inside track of who does what
can help a Startup succeed by leveraging social capital through
back channels.

Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of Facebook, the world’s foremost

with Mark on the Board, I would definitely score it high in Known

as having a Halo effect from Mark (for more see Element 32). The
halo effect and social capital in general create a Signalling Effect
(see Signalling Theory) impacts the way the venture is perceived by
others.

<-----Page 91----->Element 10: Team
History/Dynamics
What is it?
The only thing investors value more than serial entrepreneurs is
serial management teams. A team of founders that has worked
together is a treasure. A team of founders who have previously
taken a Startup to greatness is the greatest treasure of all.
Even if the new venture is entering a realm previously unknown to
the entrepreneurs, investors will value their prior history heavily.
It takes a team to succeed in the world of Startups and a team is
more than its constituent parts. Good management teams have a
good working dynamic. In fact, testing the level of friction in the
management team is a key part of Due Diligence.
Opportunity evaluators are key to witness how the founders
interact with each other. A team that doesn’t have friction may
not have it what it takes to make the hard decisions. For maximum
success, it is widely believed that a team should have a certain level
of internal friction. The friction should be challenging enough to
ensure all decisions are thoroughly vetted, but amicable enough to
overcome the daily grind of Startup life.

Why it matters?
As with serial entrepreneurs, a team with prior work history
generates confidence for investors. Investors believe that team
dynamics are crucial for success and having a team with a proven
track record helps address the issue of Management Risk (see A few
words about Risk in the opening pages of this book).

<-----Page 93----->Pain
After people comes pain. Solving a painful problem is the driving
force behind most Startups. According to business school Dean,
Roger Martin22, Entrepreneurs seek to drive profits by addressing sub
optimal solutions. The telephone was better than the telegraph, but
was less impactful than the adoption of email. The move to a more
optimal level of happiness comes from addressing an unmet need.
Yes, telegraphs allowed for remote instant communication, but the
telephone allowed for the voice of the sender to be heard and thus
provide more context for communication. The innovation cycle
continues. Years later, email allowed for remote communications
to go from voice to text. The mail system was sub optimal to the
email network. Another example, video on demand solved the pain
of forgetting to return your movies to the Blockbuster Movie Rental
store.

<-----Page 94-----><-----Page 95----->Element 11: Compelling
Unmet Need
What is it?
A colleague of mine once noted that all business should focus on
addressing an underserved pain. As a result, all Startups should
focus on providing a valuable solution to a unmet pain point.
For Startups in the B2B space (i.e., Startups selling solutions to
businesses), most pain points either attempt to increase revenues
or mitigate a cost for the customer. For Startups in the B2C space
(Startups selling directly to individual end users), the goal is often
either to alleviate a pain or increase some pleasure.
From a B2C perspective, Google helps address the pain of too much
clutter on the Internet. It does this by helping people search and
find what they are looking for. From a B2B perspective, Google
(AdWords) helps drive revenue by helping businesses connect with
those customers searching for their solution.

Why it matters?
The bigger the pain, the more likely your solution is to resonate
with customers. Big pain can mean: (a) a small cost solution with
a large market (for example, aspirin for headaches); or (b) a large
cost solution with a niche market. In some rare cases, the pain can
both be large cost and have a large market. This theory argues that
you and your friends and family have access to similar information,
while weak ties have access to knowledge outside of your social
network.

Questions to Ask
What is the goal of the venture? What problem is your team trying to

what are your future customers using to solve this problem? What
is the cost of the next best solution? How does such cost compare
to the cost of your solution?

How to score this element:
Score this opportunity a:
•	-10 if …no unmet pain exists.
•	-5 if …there is a pain but solutions already exist
•	0 if …there may be a pain point, but the market has not
	 confirmed.
•	5 if …the pain point is clear, prevalent and large but

•	10 if …early sales confirm that the pain point is clear,
	 prevalent and large.

<-----Page 97----->Element 12: Size of the Pain
What is it?
Pain is the starting point. Without a large unmet problem, it will
be difficult for innovative Startups to garner market traction. In
fact, the larger the pain, the more quickly people will adopt the
solution. Look at the extreme rates of adoption behind recent
solutions: Facebook (solving the pain of staying in touch with an
ever increasing circle of friends); Kindle (solving the pain of having
to carry heavy books with you); or even email (solving the pain of
having to send written communication by post). This is the one time
where large pain is good.

Why it matters?
If the pain doesn’t impact enough people, or doesn’t impact such
people deeply, it will be difficult to gain market traction. If current
solutions are seen as good enough, then the pain may not be
enough to justify the need for the Startup’s solution.
Generally, the larger the pain, the more revenue can be charged for
it. Generally, the larger the number of people suffering from such
pain, the larger the total addressable market (TAM) becomes.

Examples in Action
Compare: Headaches vs. HIV. The market for headache relief is
large. That’s because the whole world population is susceptible
to this inconvenient ailment. HIV, while 100x more impactful, has
a smaller total addressable market as less people are struck (as
compared to headaches) but the effect is much more grave.
Both headaches and HIV would be said to have large addressable
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 97

<-----Page 98----->markets, but HIV should generate a score on this element a +10,
while aspirin (headache solution) would only receive a +5. The
reason? The demand to fight HIV is inelastic (users would pay
almost anything to access a solution) while the demand for aspirin
is more elastic (would you pay $25 for an aspirin?).
As a rule of thumb, to scope the aggregate Size of the Pain, ask
yourself first: How many people suffer from this Pain? Then multiply
this number (the TAM) by the intensity of the problem (the size of
the pain felt by each user).

Questions to Ask
What is the goal of the venture? What problem is your team trying to
solve? Who experiences such pain? Before your solution is available
what are your future customers using to solve this problem? What
is the cost of the next best solution? How does such cost compare
to the cost of your solution?

How to score this element:
This is more than a simple quantitative calculation. As a starting
point, mentally scope the size of the market (for example, millions
of people exercise) and multiply that number by the cost of the
solution (for example, running shoes cost $200 on average). This
will give you a thumbnail sketch of the size of the pain.
Score this opportunity a:
•	-10 if …there is no unmet need.
•	-5 if …the need is small and the market is niche.
•	0 if …the market is global but the unmet need is small.
•	5 if …the market is niche but the pain is large.
•	10 if …the unmet need is huge and the total addressable
	 market is global.

<-----Page 99----->Raising the Score
To increase this element’s score, ask yourself if any other end users
are possible to focus on. Ask yourself if there are other possible
uses for your solution, service or product. See if any of these other
options (users or uses) lead to a higher pain point. For example,
Viagra® as a heart medication addressed a smaller pain point than
Viagra® as a solution for erectile dysfunction.

Hot or Not? Page 99

<-----Page 100-----><-----Page 101----->Element 13: Intensity of Pain
What is it?
HIV is more damaging than a headache. So the solution for HIV
addresses a larger pain point than aspirin. Generally, the bigger the
issue, the more people will pay for the solution and the quicker that
solution will be adopted in the market. This is the basis around the
concept of: Elasticity of Demand.
Elasticity relates to both price and demand. The more inelastic
the demand, the more a buyer will be willing to pay to acquire
it. If a product’s demand is inelastic, then customers simply must
have it. For example, your need to breathe makes the demand for
oxygen incredibility inelastic; therefore, you would pay any price to
breathe. If the demand for a product is elastic, then it is very price
sensitive (for example, you might be willing to pay $1.00 for a fresh
apple; but it is unlikely you would be willing to pay $50.00 for that
same apple). The more elastic the demand, the more impact price
changes will have on demand.

Why it matters?
Consumers have limited income. As a result, most prioritize their
needs based on inelasticity (for example, most students would buy
groceries to eat before they bought tickets to a concert, since the
need to eat is more inelastic than the need to see live music). The
inelastic the demand for a Startup’s solution, the more that Startup
can charge for the solution and the more that solution will be seen
as a “must have” item. Not just a “nice to have item”.

Questions to Ask
Why do people buy what you are selling? What drives their desire?
How would classify that desire: is it a need or a want?

•	-5 if …the problem has high elasticity of demand and is thus
	 very price sensitive (e.g., customers would buy it for $1.00

•	5 if …many third parties have identified this market has

	 (i.e., customers will pay any price for it).

<-----Page 103----->Element 14: Durability
of the Opportunity
What is it?
According to modern scholars23, an opportunity has four key
elements. It must be:
1) Attractive: it has to offer a 10x better solution.
2) Timely: the market is ready to buy what you are selling.
3) Durable: the opportunity must last long enough to crystalize
	 the potential (i.e., it has to last long enough for you to sell
	 your solution).
4) Value adding: it offers a solution seen as valuable to
	 potential customers.
In 2008, after Barack Obama was elected president and “Yes We
Can!” T-shirts were in demand as Americans wanted to wear them
to show their support. Two years later, with the President’s approval
rating at an all-time low, these shirts couldn’t be given away at any
price. Thus the opportunity for “Yes We Can!” T-shirts might have
been seen as timely, but not as durable.
One of the scenes in the movie Back to the Future has time traveling
protagonist Marty McFly playing Johnny B. Goode at a 1955 high
school prom. His audience is dancing away to every beat of his
song, the band members have big smiles on their faces and he’s
captivated his audience. Then Marty starts shredding his guitar,
sliding across the stage, jumping from the speakers and crawling
along the floor— and as soon as he hits the high note, he realizes
his audience is staring at him with a look of horror and shock. And
then he says, “I guess you guys aren’t ready for that, but your kids
are gonna love it.”

<-----Page 104----->At the start of the 21st Century, Facebook timed their product
launches perfectly to coincide with the general population’s
readiness for social networking, and they turned the industry into
a hot market. Hot markets are always a great thing to be a part of
because they can lead to such intense demand that frantic buyers
are fighting over products. Even if you’re not the top business in a
hot market, you’re still going to do well. This is a dream come true
for any business owner.
In other words: Timing is Everything. Rock and Roll was a hot
new trend in 1955, however shredding the guitar and jumping off
speakers wasn’t widely adopted and accepted until the mid-1980s
after Punk and Heavy Metal made those practices part of the rock
experience. When launching a new business, the best scenario is
one in which you can be a part of a market that is on the verge of
turning hot. The timing has to be perfect—not too early and not too
late. Returning to our example of social networking sites, remember
that before Facebook and Myspace, there was Friendster. This site
launched in 2003 and quickly adopted 3 million users, but they
were still too new for the general population and thus fell behind
Facebook when it overtook its competitors.

How do you spot hot markets?
Through the news, water-cooler chat and walking down the street
and paying attention to people’s behaviours. The signs of changing
trends are everywhere. A useful online tool is Google Trends which
lists the top 100 most searched terms in the past day. It’s a great
way to see what people are interested in. Almost every night on the
news I hear about the spread of swine flu across the world. I’m sure
any business selling products that help fight swine flu is doing really
well right now. Some other big trends occurring today are:
•	Anything to do with seniors, as the baby boom generation is

•	Anything in mobile and iPhone applications
•	Hygiene products
•	Fuel-efficient cars
•	Junk removal
The two entrepreneurs from Tidy Trailers24 are certainly part of a
bigger trend: junk removal. Even as a small business with low brand
recognition, the hot market is probably one of the reasons why the
company was able to bring in good revenue. People simply have
too much stuff and this provides a hot business opportunity.

Why it matters?
In today’s global, competitive, and rapidly innovating environment
one must not only be quick to market to capture demand, but
founders must ensure that demand will be durable enough to allow
the Startup to profit from it. After all, solutions to the Y2K problem
had very little value in 2001.
Any entrepreneur jumping into a hot market is more likely to
succeed because there are already customers waiting to buy. So
always be aware of how hot or cold your market is and how its
timeliness will affect your business.

Questions to Ask
What evidence do you have that the market will wait for your
solution? Who else is working on this problem? How are along are
your direct competitors?

<-----Page 108-----><-----Page 109----->Element 15: The 10x Rule
What is it?
In order to overcome market incumbents, new solutions must
be 10x better. This is at the heart of the 10x Rule. Being a slightly
better, faster, stronger, more cost efficient is not enough. In order
to attract customers away from their current means of addressing
the pain, your new solution must be 10x better than the current
solution.
Once you have an idea that someone will be willing to pay for, how
do you improve it so that everyone is willing to pay for it? Begin
looking at every possible way to make the idea so much better that
it satisfies the 10x Rule. The 10x Rule means that in order to gain
market traction a product must be exponentially better than the
incumbent solutions in that it is. 10 times faster, 10 times smaller,
10 times cheaper, and 10 times more profitable.
The reason for this rule: Market adoption. Historically, being a little
better isn’t enough to gain huge market share fast. Now compare
that to some other improvements we have seen:
•	Email is WAY faster than snail mail. Email is a successful
	product.
•	Air travel is WAY faster than train. Air travel is a successful
	product.
•	Mp3 players can hold WAY more than CD players. Mp3
	 player is a successful product.

Examples in Action
Email was so widely adopted in such a short timeframe because
it was 10x faster than traditional mail, so much so that traditional
postal service is colloquially now referred to as snail mail. Wikipedia

Hot or Not? Page 109

<-----Page 110----->has 10x the articles as Encyclopaedia Britannica. Amazon has
10x the number of books as the World’s Largest Brick & Mortar
Bookstore (located in downtown Toronto, my home town). Apple’s
iPod™ holds more than 10x the songs of any Sony Walkman™.
Obviously, this is an oversimplification. In most, if not all these
cases, the product diffused because of its quick integration into the
demands of an ever evolving productive lifestyle. Email is better
than mail because it is instant and because it allows social distance
(less intimate and iterative that the phone), Wikipedia is better than
the encyclopaedia because it is a shared, free, editable resource,
not because it is just 10x bigger, and so on.

Why it matters?
Being incrementally innovative is not sufficient. A little better is
not good enough. A little cheaper won’t move customers to adopt.
In all but a few markets, the pain your solution addresses is being
addressed. E.g. Yes, email is faster than snail mail. But the telegraph
was already a faster way to communicate.
Most of your potential customers have already some form of
solution in place. Next best is often good enough. The rate of
adoption of a new product is directly correlated to the quantum of
innovation being proposed. The 10x rule implies that exponentially
better solutions are required to overcome the impact of sunk
costs.25
If you already bought a non-returnable iPad 1 on sale and then the
next month a newer version, say the iPad 2, is released. In most
cases, the newer version would have to be at least 10x better to
make a customer want to purchase it. This is less an issue of price,
and more an issue of cognitive dissonance. The concept of sub
optimal solutions is also at play here. Killer ideas, those that totally
change the status quo are called disruptive.

What is it?
If a product wasn’t created by the Startup, most investors will
not invest. Regardless that an entrepreneur might have exclusive
license to sell such an object in that country, if your main solution,
product or service is not created by the founders, most investors
will call a hard stop.

Why it matters?
The reason should be obvious: future research and development,
or R&D. If the Startup is able to attract a customer base, what will
the Startup sell next? From where will new ideas come?

Examples in Action
Microsoft® in the late 1990s was famous for having an internal
attitude against products not developed in house by Microsoft®.
This bias is commonly referred to as “Not Invented Here27” syndrome
or simply “NIH”. For many years it was believed that Microsoft’s
expansion would be the result of internal R&D.
Compare this to Google who not only grew revenue through internal
R&D development (e.g., Gmail) but also through Startup acquisition
(e.g., YouTube). As discussed later (Element 30) acquisitions are one
way large companies expand their product and services.

reap the benefits from such for limited period of time (in some
cases more than 25 years). There are many types of IP (for example,
trademarks, copyrights), but for most entrepreneurs the patent is
the key to protecting their IP.
A patent is granted by a country’s patent office. Every country’s IP
laws are different, but generally: A patent is granted if an innovation
is seen (by a government inspector) to have novelty, utility and nonobviousness. A patent allows the owner exclusive rights to do a
particular thing in a particular way for a limited time. A patent gives
the holder the exclusive right to monetize their innovation. After
a set number of years (which may differ by country), the patent
will expire and the solution becomes public domain meaning that
anyone can reproduce it without permission. Solutions in the public
domain allow anyone to utilize the innovation for commercial gain.
Similarly a trademark (for example, Nike’s Just Do It!) gives the
owner the exclusive right to use that phrase. Both may require filing
with the federal government to ensure your rights are declared,
approved and protected. Typically it is best to register your IP before
showing it the general public (or going on national television). In the
case of patents, going on television and disclosing your technology
to the world before filing would not be wise, in fact doing so may
invalidate your ability to get a patent at all.
To that end, most investors prefer entrepreneurs first talk to their
lawyers and file all the paperwork to protect their intellectual
property before seeking capital.

<-----Page 116----->Why it matters?
IP is meant to reward the holders with the sole right to monetize
the innovation and recoup monies invested. Some argue that IP is
necessary to facilitate commercial investment. Others feel that IP
laws are out-dated and actually hinder innovation.
But what if all you have is a good idea but it is not a proprietary
patentable technology? Well let’s be clear, ideas aren’t protectable.
Having a good idea is not enough. Would we pay James Cameron
for his ideas of Titanic and Avatar? Or would we pay for a ticket to
see the movie? It was Cameron’s execution, not his ideas that won
him Oscars. The same is true for investments. It is the execution of
the idea that has value, not the idea itself.

Examples in Action
If Inventor Ms. D. invents a new way of curing student lateness, she
may file for a patent. It would give her, and only her, the right to sell
solutions based on her invention. It would also publish her solution
and provide to the public information about how her innovation
works.

Questions to Ask
What is proprietary about your solution? Who invented it? When
was the patent filed? Registered? Granted? What exactly is yours
and yours alone to do?

How to score this element:
•	-10 if …the solution is not proprietary.
•	-5 if …the solution is proprietary but the IP has not yet been
	 filed.

•	10 if …there are multiple patents GRANTED globally.

Raising the Score
Finally a patent is often cost prohibitive (could cost upwards of
$25,000 per patent) and often unenforceable (due to the Startup’s
lack of resources). Notwithstanding, filing for a patent or other
forms of IP, can add more value to the venture than they cost.
Furthermore, it can take many years to have a patent processed
(and rejected) during such time, a venture with many “patents
pending” is seem more valuable than a venture without IP. So file
what you can to raise this element’s score.

<-----Page 118-----><-----Page 119----->Element 18: Key Asset Access
What is it?
Some solutions require access to specific and explicit scarce
commodities. For example, high school gymnasiums can only be
rented out to one group at a time. If a group had monopolistic
control over the rent charged, they would score high on this element.
Likewise, if a necessary asset is scarce or, worse yet, dependent on
access provided by a monopolizing group (for example, oil because
it requires skilled people with special equipment to extract and
refine), the score would fall.

Why it matters?
Scarcity drives most pricing. If your solution depends on the product
of another, then your venture is exposed to risk. Risk that could
result in downward margin pressure.

Examples in Action
GUATS28 makes the world’s softest pyjamas. Their BamJamz™ are
made from bamboo. If there should be a shortage of bamboo, their
business would be greatly affected.
A call centre typically requires access to minimum wage employees.
A mobile software app developer requires programmers with
knowledge and experience with mobile software. A shortage of
either of these human resources would exert downward pressure
on profit margins.

<-----Page 121----->Element 19: Proof of Concept
What is it?
All entrepreneurs believe in the possibility of their success. To gain
objective perspective, investors often seek a third party’s arm’s
length evidence that your product is valuable. Every entrepreneur
that has stood before investors thinks that they have a great business
idea and it will make millions of dollars. When you have invested
a lot of time and money into a business idea you’re likely going
to think it’s worth the investment. The result is the entrepreneur
has a biased perception of the business idea, which is why every
entrepreneur must find a way to prove that their business idea will
turn a profit.
The best way to convince an investor that people will be willing to
buy your product is by waving a big sales order in front of them. In
other words, get customers now, even before you have built your
product. How can you possibly get a sales order without having
built anything? It can be done, and some of the most successful
entrepreneurs are the ones who can make a sale on just an idea.
One way to do so is by providing the customer an incentive for
taking the risk of purchasing your product so early. A common
example is condominium builders who sell units even before a
shovel has broken the ground. All they have to show the customers
are concept pictures, an empty lot and a very good salesperson. In
turn, the customer can purchase the condo at a discounted price for
taking the risk that the condo may not be built exactly as promised.
Some of the other main advantages to gain customers early in the
process are:
•	Offsets the cost of building the product. You automatically
	 get cash in hand with interest accumulating in the bank.

<-----Page 122----->•	Reduces the need to seek out financing from investors.
•	Provides a growing number of users who can provide
	feedback.
•	Confirms there is a need for this product.
When two engineers pitched Softshell Computers29, investors were
quick to tell them how ridiculous the idea seemed. As soon as one
of their customers provided investors with her testimony of how
their product has cut down on her house cleaning because she
spends all her time using their product, the Dragons were sold too.
You can be assured you’re onto something big if you’re able to
make this early sale at pretty much any price. If a customer is
willing to pay for your product at any price, than that’s excellent
evidence that the demand for this product is extremely high. It is
also excellent motivation for you and others to build the product as
quickly as possible. In economic terms this means that the price is
inelastic and this term brings smiles to investor faces.
Even if you’re unable to make any sales this early, letters of intent
are better than nothing. An entrepreneur is always selling their
business idea—to customers, investors, employees, partners, and
even to their spouses. Your word that your idea is great can only go
so far, but showing evidence will prove it.

Why it matters?
The best proof of concept is sales. Sales show that demand for
the product exists but early sales do much more. With early sales,
entrepreneurs:
1) Can directly engage with future user to evolve solutions.
2) Can lower their dependence on external capital.
3) Can validate assumptions in the revenue model.
Sales are not the only form of proof of concept. Other third

partnerships, investor list and early adopters. Often there is so
much uncertainty at play in innovation, reviewers are wise to look
everywhere and anywhere for additional validation.

Examples in Action
During an annual venture fair (for example, where companies come
to pitch a panel of investors) I once watched a bombastic venture
capitalist loudly, and in a very public manner, inform a presenter the
fallibility of their venture. He stood up and yelled from the judge’s
table: “This is a stupid idea. No one will buy it. How do you even
know anyone cares enough to buy it?” The entrepreneurs’ answer
was calm, confident and much less loud. The berated founder
simply replied: “Because we sold 10,000 units in the first 90 days”.
Nothing says proof of concept like actual sales.

Questions to Ask?
Other than the founders and family, who else believes in this
venture? What proof do you have that anybody cares about your
solution?

How to Score this Element
This element is fairly easy to score. The more reliable, external,
reputable the source of the evidence presented is, the higher the
score.
•	-10 if …only the founders and family have seen the solution
	 in action.
•	-5 if …partners, investors, etc. have shown confidence in the
	opportunity.
•	0 if …the solution has been deployed but is in the pilot stage.

	 founders are still working on improvements and expansion.
•	10 if …founders have a long history of sales, and sales
	 continue to grow.

Raising the Score
The best proof of concept, the most compelling evidence that your
product, service or solution is needed, is sales revenue. Nothing
is more compelling proof than actual customers buying actual
solutions.
But what if it is too early to generate sales from this opportunity?
Well in that case, you can raise this element’s score by generating
third party evidence through alternate means. These means might
include: endorsements, focus groups, corporate partnerships,
strategic investments, shared go to market plans, etc. Anything that
shows reviewers you are not alone in believing this opportunity is
great, will go far to increase this element’s score.

What is it?
In real estate the mantra is location, location, location. In
entrepreneurship the mantra is sell, sell, sell. Prior to the dot.com
bubble bursting a decade ago, proof of concept was seen to be:
turn the light switch ona light goes on.
Today, more and more investors have expanded the proof of
concept definition to be: turn the light switch on a light goes on
a customer pays $5/hour to read under it.
In today’s world of Agile Development, the mantra is fail fast; fail
often. Innovations are tested against the market as soon as possible.
If the market doesn’t want to pay for what a venture is selling, then
is there a need for that innovation.

Why it matters?
Nothing helps an opportunity succeed like success! Revenue means
the solution is valued by end users. Revenue can also generate
secondary benefits, including:
•	Early and direct access to customer feedback;
•	Validation of assumptions in the revenue model;
•	A deeper understanding what it will take to sell and scale
	 the solution.

Questions to Ask?
Have you sold your product/solution/service? What was the total
revenue over the last 18 months? Were they early sales or more

<-----Page 127----->Element 21: Strong Margins
What is it?
Margin is an accounting concept representing a percentage of the
difference between the cost of making a product and its price.
Margin represents how much profit you make from the sale of
each unit. Strong margins refer to both margins that are large and
margins that are sustainable.
Accounting terms, including: EBITA, breakeven point and COGS
should be familiar to all opportunity evaluators. If they are not, flip
to the Glossary section and familiarize yourself with them.
The core value of margins lies in to additional accounting concepts:
ARPU and CoCA. ARPU (average revenue per user) helps to
determine how much revenue each new customer brings in. If
you are selling an app on iTunes™ the ARPU would be gross sales
divided by the number of users. If you are selling business legal
services, the ARPU would be calculated using this equation: total
hours billed in revenue divided by number of corporate clients
served. In a nutshell, ARPU represents how much extra you make
each time you add a new client.
CoCA (cost of client acquisition) is a similarly calculated figure, this
time based on Total Sales & Marketing costs for the year divided by
the number of new clients acquired.
Notwithstanding these formulas, this element does not require you
to quantitatively calculate the net profits. You need not have all the
information either. Instead, simply look to the top level margins to
ensure that ARPU always swamps CoCA (for example, the amount
to acquire a new user is significantly less than the money that client
brings to the venture).

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 127

<-----Page 128----->Why it matters?
Large margins are good. They afford the entrepreneur flexibility.
They allow for greater price flexibility which in turn protects against
opportunities that have demand elasticity (i.e., if you have small
margins, you need ample demand). But extremely large margins
are attractive. And large margins can attract competition as others
try to can mine the opportunity.
Innovators often look to elements like: huge market potential, first
mover advantage, network effects, etc. But good innovators also
recognize the role margins play.

Examples in Action
If grocery store buys apples at $1 a bag and sells those same apples
an hour later for $2, the margin on apples is 50%. If that same store
buys apples the next day for $2 a bag and sells those same apples
an hour later for $3 the margin that day is 33%. The drop in margin
not only raised the risk (in the first case if you couldn’t resell the
apples you would be out only $1, but in the second case, your loss
would double). In the world of opportunity evaluation, you always
seek higher margins. Higher margins allow for more stability in
uncertain economies by providing wiggle room on the price.
An entrepreneur pitched investors: Tan on the Run30, a mobile
tanning business. She has been making good profits so far and was
hoping to franchise her business. Investors were concerned that it
would be difficult to scale her business because the cost to service
each customer was fairly high.
As Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary told her: “All the cost of going
there, setting up time, then going back, is built into your price.

somewhere. You’re charging the same and you’re doing all this
extra work. If you had a fixed location you could line them up like
cattle and spray them down.”
Investors are seeking investments that can scale because they want
5 to 10 times the return on the amount of money they’ve invested.
Tan on the Run is a great business for one entrepreneur but with
the low profit margin, it will face challenges when it tries to scale
towards franchises. When you hear investors mention scalability,
they’re really talking about how much potential a business has to
make a lot of money.

Questions to Ask?
What are your gross margins? Your EBITA? How do you mark up (i.e.,
place a margin on) your product? What are the cost of the goods
being sold? What do you buy your resources (for example, talent,
food, lumber) at? At what price are you selling your solution? Do
others (e.g., retailers) mark up your solution?

How to Score this Element
Give this element a:
•	-10 if …margins are less than 20% or if CoCA < ARPU
•	-5 if …margins are less than 50%.
•	0 if …margins are fluctuating and not yet stable enough to
	evaluate.
•	5 if …margins are less than 100%. ARPU is much larger than
	CoCA.
•	10 if …the solution has huge margins, greater than 100%.
	 ARPU is 10x CoCA.

<-----Page 130----->Raising the Score
To increase this element’s score, really focus on the following
formula:

CoCA < ARPU
Cost to find clients must be less than the revenue from clients

Consider business models that will lower CoCA or boost ARPU. To
lower CoCA one might deploy Gorilla Marketing techniques or
engage in viral marketing. Anything that gets potential customers
to try before they buy will potentially drive CoCA down in the long
run (although in the short run it may have the opposite effect). To
increase the ARPU consider the theory of Double Dipping. Double
Dipping refers to the ability to:
•	Build the product, service, solution once;
•	Bill for it twice; and
•	Generate revenue three times.
The author of this book was able to Double Dip when he worked
on Dragons’ Den for five seasons. He was paid to support the show;
then paid again to give keynote speeches about the show; then
paid again to transform his experience into content for this book,
effectively double dipping (actually, triple dipping might be more
accurate).
To raise the score on this element brainstorm ways to double dip.
Can you sell upgrades? Can you switch to a recurring revenue model
($9.99/month instead of $99.99 onetime)? Will users want refills or
extras? Could you sell the same product to another market? All of
these efforts, done well, would raise this element’s score.

<-----Page 131----->Element 22: Scalability
What is it?
Scalability refers to an opportunity’s potential to bring in top line
revenue faster than the growth of related costs. Put another way,
the margins (see Element 23: Margins) grow as volumes grow .
Online software as a service is extremely scalable. Facebook™ adds
thousands of new members each day, but each new member does
not cost very much because of the sheer number of members over
which that cost is amortized). Professional services (e.g., lawyer)
are not very scalable. For a lawyer to make more money from his
revenue model, he must either: (a) work more hours or (b) charge
more per hour. Legal services do not scale, since increases in volume
do not necessarily lead to large product savings.
Scalability has a lot to do variable costs. Fixed Costs refer to expenses
that are incurred no matter how many units are produced/sold.
Filing a patent (see Element 18: IP) is a fixed cost. The legal fees on
the patent filing are the same if the company filing sells one, many
or none of the patent’s subject.
Variable Costs are expenses dependant on the number of units
sold. The amount of steel used by Toyota Motors is a variable cost.
The more cars they make, the more steel needed, the greater
the cost. In theory, to be scalable means to have relatively small
variable costs. Downloadable software is extremely scalable, since
once the application is developed, a fixed cost, the cost to sell,
to distribute and to reproduce (the variable costs) fall almost to
zero. Contrast the scalable software domain with the virtually nonscalable professional services domain.
Law services are not scalable, since the revenue model for law is:
number of hours billable X average hourly billable rate X number of
lawyers working.

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 131

<-----Page 132----->In order for a lawyer to drive greater revenue, she must do one of
three things:
•	work more billable hours; or
•	raise her hourly rate; or
•	hire more associates.
This means that revenue and costs will grow in sync. This in turn
undermines a lawyer’s ability to scale.

Why it matters?
Scalability is the key to innovation. For a product to be rapidly
and widely adopted the variable costs should be relatively low. An
Economy of Scale is a macroeconomic concept that refers to the
cost advantages garnered by expansion. Some factors of production
can lead to a decrease in the average per unit cost of production.
Literally, by making more of the solution the company makes better
margins.

How to Score this Element
Give this element a:
•	-10 if …there are no economies of scale to be had.
•	-5 if …there are few economies of scale to leverage.
•	0 if …scalability is unproven due to few sales.
•	5 if …the solution is moderately scalable.
•	10 if …the solution is very scalable.

Province refers to what industry the Startup works in. Province
refers to the portfolio of elements that reflect the domain or market

or specific (athletic footwear) or even niche (skateboard street
sneakers). Most companies intrinsically know what industry they

What is it?
You’ve just created the best product in the world. Perhaps millions
of people could benefit from using your product. It’s easy for your
friends and family to learn about your concept, but how does the
rest of the world find out? Unless you’re in the movie Field of
Dreams, if you build it doesn’t mean that people will start lining up
outside your house to buy it. You will need a marketing plan and a
strategy to convince the masses to purchase your product.
Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations theory outlines that there are five
different groups of people who adopt new products at different
points in time. Rogers’ Theory of Innovation Diffusion32 attempts to
classify product adoption along a curve representing several distinct
stages (Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority
and Laggards). While most entrepreneurs believe the earlier, the
better, that isn’t always the case.
Innovators (the first 2.5% of adopters) can require much more
convincing than laggards who buy because everyone else already
has. In the 20th century, it could take a product decades to move
through the entire cycle. More recently, these cycles are compressed
and thus they have become more gaugeable. For example, did you
get a Facebook account before your friends? Before your parents?
Before your Grandparents?
It is much easier to get product adoption by the innovators and
early adopters as they are more open minded and willing to take
a risk on a new product. The most difficult step is getting the early
majority to adopt the product. This is key because the majority has
the population numbers to really boost revenue and transform a

•	Placement: Viagra was originally intended to be a heart
	 medication, then later branded as a sex enhancing
	 medication that led to increasing sales.
•	Publicity: When Virgin Mobile launched in Canada, Richard

	 Hummers and beautiful models named the “Mobile
	 Revolutionaries” who spread the “word of mobile freedom”.

While having a group of early adopters buying your product is great,
the real money is made by getting your product popular with the
majority. To get to the majority you need to execute a reasonable
strategic marketing plan targeted at a specific demographic. Just
because you build it, doesn’t mean they’ll come, you need to invite
them.

Examples in Action
Did you know that the Startup Friendster predated Facebook as the
first widely adopted social network? Despite their innovativeness,
the founders were too early. The market for social networks in 2002
was not yet developed. Only innovators (that first 2.5% of users who
buy first) were interested and that segment wasn’t large enough to
facilitate growth. A few years later, Facebook took advantage of the
market’s move to early adopters by focusing initially on students.

Why it matters?
Each stage in Rogers’s model requires a different strategy.
Entrepreneurs must be mindful to match their strategy (and budget)
to the appropriate stage. Further, in order to be timely the market
must be ready for your solution. Nothing is more frustrating than
being too early for the market.
If your innovation is too ahead of the market, you may find it difficult
to attract enough customers to justify your opportunity’s existence.
You may even run out of capital before the market warms to your
solution. If your solution is too far behind the market, you may find
your customers buying alternatives instead of your innovation.

<-----Page 139----->Element 24: Industry CAGR
What is it?
CAGR is an investment acronym which stands for Compound
Annual Growth Ratez and represents the year-over-year historical
growth of an industry. The larger the CAGR of a market, the faster
that market is growing.
Typically, a hot market is one with a CAGR > 25%.

Why it matters?
The aphorism: a rising tide lifts all boats is fitting to CAGR—an
industry-wide growth benefits all those within that industry. As a
result, opportunities in hot domains (those with large CAGR) are
more attractive to both investors and entrepreneurs.
The business of innovation is difficult enough in any market, so why
focus on addressing a market that isn’t growing? Put another way,
would you rather a start a business in email security or in horse
saddles? Email is a booming industry, horses are not.
While it is possible to calculate CAGR for an industry and it is also
possible to access a list of such calculations, neither is strictly
necessary to evaluate this element. Most investors (and other
opportunity evaluators) simply go with their gut instinct when it
comes to assessing CAGR’s impact on an opportunity.

contraction of their demand, and thus those industries would have
low CAGR.

Questions to Ask
What industry do you fit within? What major developments
occurred this year in that industry?

How to Score
The better the CAGR: the better the score. The faster an opportunity’s
industry is growing, the better the score. The hotter the market: the
better the score. Here’s a starting point to score this element:
•	-10 if …the Startup’s industry is not growing, or worse yet is
contracting.
•	-5 if ...the CAGR is small.
•	0 if …market growth rate is unknown.
•	5 if …the CAGR is large and approaching 25%.
•	10 if …the CAGR is greater than 25% and market is red hot.

<-----Page 141----->Element 25: Distribution Strength
What is it?
A great solution can’t be adopted rapidly unless it can garner
wide distribution. That’s the real power of the Internet and digital
Startups. They have solutions that can be globally distributed for
low cost.

Why it matters?
Most solutions are only needed by some subset of the population.
The smaller the subset of users, the wider a Startup’s distribution
must be to garner enough sales to be sustainable.

Examples in Action
Apple launched iTunes (a system to sell and distribute music) in
January 2001. Ten years later iTunes represents more than 80%
of the entire digital market for music36. With such a large share of
the market, Apple would be seen as having powerful distribution
strength (i.e., + 10).

Questions to Ask?
How do people acquire your solution? How many have access to
that outlet?

<-----Page 143----->Element 26: Current Competition
What is it?
Every opportunity has competition. Your future customers always
have a choice regarding how they choose to solve their problems
and address their unmet needs. Competition comes in many forms:
Direct, Indirect, Alternatives and Status Quo. In fact, anything your
future customers choose to do, excluding buying your solution, is
competition.
Let’s take an example that occurs daily in homes across the United
States. Let’s say your teenage daughter comes home and proclaims:
“I NEED a new pair of Nike Soccer Shoes.” What alternatives do you,
the buyer, have?
•	Direct: those companies selling the exact same solution/
	 product/service. In this case, a pair of high end soccer shoes
	 from Reebok.
•	Indirect: those companies selling to the same customers
	 a slightly different solution. In this case, a pair of knockoff
	 soccer shoes. Half the price.
•	Alternative: different solutions your future customers can
	 buy instead of yours. Instead of buying soccer shoes for your
	 daughter, she could wear her older cousins soccer shoes.
	 This would meet her needs, but not lead to a sale for Nike.
•	Status Quo: the “do nothing” option. Perhaps, your daughter
	 should simply wear the pair of athletic shoes you bought
	 her last year?
It is worth noting that while Status Quo is often the most forgotten
source of competition, it is also the most impactful. I’ve personally
seen hundreds of businesses fail because the “do nothing”
option was good enough for their potential customers. Never

<-----Page 144----->underestimate the power of status quo.

Why it matters?
If your customers have more choice, your product needs to have a
more compelling value proposition (see Element 16: The 10x Rule)
to attract adopters.
Competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, competition can
help validate the opportunity, educate early adopters and help
define and differentiate your opportunity’s value proposition.
NOTE: Never, ever say your opportunity has no competition. If you
do, you will leave investors (and other opportunity evaluators)
thinking one of two possibilities: (1) you don’t know how to
undertake competitive analysis, or worse, you don’t know how to
use Google to find your competition; or (2) the opportunity you
think you have is actually such a dead end that no one else on the
planet would bother pursuing it.
Another benefit of competition is that it can provide a baseline
against which your Startup can be measured, illustrating the need
for your venture. When your competitors do a poor job of meeting
customer needs, we classify them as Good Competition (good
because they make you look GOOD). If your competitors outshine
your business we refer to them as Bad Competition (bad because
they undermine your sales). Ideally, you want good completion as
such will only drive more customers your way.

Examples in Action
Couriers are bad competition for the postal service in that they show
the weakness of the postal offerings (e.g., no same day service).
Inversely, the postal service is good competition for the couriers
like FedEx and UPS in that they illustrate the value proposition
being offered (i.e., same day service). Whether your competition is
Page 144 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 145----->good or bad is a matter of relative perspective.
Note: There is no amount of ideal competition. Too little competition
may undermine investor confidence. Too much competition may
scare investors. Founders are cautioned about entering a so called
“hot market”. A hot market would be one that general population is
discussing in the media. Ideally novel game changing opportunities
are ahead of such mass awareness. Further, Companies that tack
into a hot market business of others based on the hype those
companies are generating are called “ME too plays” and aren’t
often seen as novel. Dr. Jym Morton, who teaches Opportunity
Evaluation, is fond of saying: “Don’t jump on a bandwagon that’s
standing room only”. Meaning if your market is filled with tens of
competitors you may need to reconsider the market.

How to Score
First, make a list of all the competition. Include direct, indirect,
alternatives and status quo. Label which are good competition and
which are bad competition, then use the following:
•	-10 if …the entrepreneur says “we have no competition”.
•	-5 if …the only competition is bad. The market is filled with
	 leading large companies.
•	0 if …there is a good mix of bad and good competition.
•	5 if …there is competition, but only from other Startups
	 looking to address the market.
•	10 if …there is lots of good competition. Current customers
	 confirm they are in desperate need of a new solution to
	 address their unmet needs.

<-----Page 146-----><-----Page 147----->Element 27: Future Competition
What is it?
Most innovative Startups attempt to use new solutions to solve
old unmet problems. But an unmet need, especially a large and
lucrative one, attracts lots of companies. As a result, competitive
analysis must also include a look at future competition.
Future competition can lead to what Thomas McKnight calls Ambush
Exposure . McKnight defines Ambush Exposure as the possibility
that some invisible “competitor” with extraordinary means and
resources could find your product or service so compelling or
threatening that they plunge into your market and help themselves
to your customers.
Most Startups seek disruptive innovations. Disruptive innovation, a
term of art coined by Clayton Christensen38, describes a process by
which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications
at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves ‘up market’,
eventually displacing established competitors. According to
Christensen:
An innovation that is disruptive allows a whole new population
of consumer’s access to a product or service that was
historically only accessible to consumers with a lot of money
or a lot of skill. Disruptive innovations, when monetized fully,
can be pure gold. Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google all made
their fortunes through disruptive innovation.

•	e.g., Amazon disrupts brick and mortar bookstores.
But in creating a disruptive innovation, and in showing the large
amounts of wealth it can create, you alert the larger companies in
your ecosystem to the opportunity. The best example I can think of
is how offline bookstores (i.e., Borders, Barnes & Noble, and Indigo)
only launched their own online bookstores after Amazon showed
them what would happened if they didn’t. Amazon was “ambushed”
by these brick and mortar retailers who initially resisted the online
world for fear of cannibalization of offline sales.

Why it matters?
Most opportunities need to be durable (see Element 15: Durability).
They need to last at least long enough (and generate enough money)
to justify the expense of bringing the solution to market. In most
cases, the greatest threat may not come from current competition
but from an ambush.

Examples in Action
In 2002, I was pitched a solution which aggregated and indexed
academic publications. For years, university scholars needed
to check hard copy indexes and a slew of aggregators to have a
complete research history picture. The founders believed this was a
huge unmet need and felt they could monetize the need by selling
subscription services to universities worldwide.
Despite the fact that the founders had great insight into the
opportunity, I was nagged by the Google factor. I worried if Google,
which specializes in indexing and searching large stores of data,
could get into this space. The concern was justifiable, I didn’t think
these founders could compete head to head with the search giant,
even though Google wasn’t even in the market yet. In November
2004, Google launched Google Scholar. This offered free and global

methods and technologies of Google.

Questions to Ask?
Who else could easily move into your market? What would be the
biggest future threat to the viability of the opportunity? In a worst
case scenario, which 800 Lbs. Gorilla might move into your market?

How to Score
•	-10 if …there are lots of 800-pound gorillas eyeing the
	 market, poised to ambush your opportunity.
•	-5 if …no big player has entered the market, but several
	could.
•	0 if …the risk of ambush exposure is neutral.
•	5 if …at the moment, the risk of ambush exposure seems
	small.
•	10 if …the opportunity has proprietary aspects (e.g., IP) that
	 would make larger companies want to buy the Startup
	 instead of competing with it.

Raising the Score
An investor once told Lipstixx, “You know if you look up in the
dictionary the most competitive business from hell, it’s the
cosmetics industry. They’ll blow your car up in the driveway.”
Instead of Lipstixx trying to enter the cosmetics industry it may
be best for them to license or sell their technology to one of the
competitors. That way, they can get a decent payday and not risk
being in a fierce industry.

<-----Page 150-----><-----Page 151----->Element 28: Barriers to Entry
What is it?
By definition, a Barrier to Entry is any continuous hindrance that
deters a competitor from entering your market. If the federal
government requires your Startup to be licensed, that is a barrier to
entry. If your Startup has the only supply of a key asset (see Element
19)) needed to generate the desired solution, that is a barrier to
entry. If you own the proprietary technology (see Element 18)
and are the only company able to leverage such, the IP becomes a
barrier to entry.
According scholar Harold Demsetz39, other potential Barriers to
Entry, may include:
•	Market Regulations
•	Exclusive distribution agreements
•	Inelastic Demand
•	Predatory Pricing
•	Sunk and Switching Costs
Every venture needs to create obstacles that make it difficult for
a competitor to enter your market. The most common barrier to
entry is a patent. A patent gives the inventor exclusive rights to use
a specific technology for a specific amount of time, often 20 years.
When Larry Brun pitched the Attitube40, he took time to explain the
unique features of his product and then answered one of the most
important questions: “Do you have a patent?” Fortunately for Brun,
he did have a patent in Canada and the US, which gave investors the
secure feeling that if they invested in the product, the competition
could not copy the technology.

<-----Page 152----->Other examples of barriers to entry can include:
•	Cost Leadership. Get your product at a cheaper cost, which
allows you to sell the product at a cheaper price. Walmart is
really good at this.
•	Customer Loyalty. Many people will only use Google as their
search engine because they trust that it is the fastest and most
accurate. We will see if Bing can break through this barrier.
•	Control of resources. If you’re making bamboo T-shirts
and you have a way to control the flow of bamboo, then no
competitor will be able to make bamboo shirts.
When shaping your idea, improve it to a point that it is 10x better
than any alternative and protect your idea by putting up barriers to
entry.

Why it matters?
The bigger the barriers to entry, the harder it will be for a future bad
competitor to ambush your venture. Barriers to entry add to the
cost of market entry and therefore serve to enhance incumbents.
(see Element 34)

Examples in Action
The airline industry has large barriers to entry. First, federal
regulations are costly to meet. Second, the costs to acquire all the
equipment needed to launch an airline is extremely high. Third,
airlines must reach agreements with all the airports they wish to fly
to. These are just a few of the many barriers to entry which make
the airline industry unattractive to many entrepreneurs and most
investors.

<-----Page 154-----><-----Page 155----->Element 29: Exit Options
What is it?
In order to crystalize the value of the Startup, shareholders need an
exit. An exit is an investment term used to define the moment that
the shareholders (for example, founders, investors, employees) are
able to cash out.
Most Startups typically exit in one of four ways: Acquisition, Public
Offering, Buy Back or Bankruptcy.
Acquisition occurs when a larger company buys the Startup (either
by acquiring all the shares of the Startup, or all the assets). A public
offering occurs when a Startup lists its equity in a public market or
stock exchange.
The IPO is the most famous public offering exit, but others do exist
(for example, the reverse takeover). Buyback occurs when the
Startup has enough free cash flow to buy back the shares of investors
and founders. However, this is extremely rare as few Startups have
the cash necessary, and those that do are so successful it is unlikely
that any shareholders or investor would want to exit them.) By far,
the most common exit is bankruptcy. Less than two in ten venture
backed companies lead to a successful exit. That means more than
80% of the money invested by Angels and Venture Capital ends
poorly in bankruptcy.
Every entrepreneur eventually needs money. Some want the money
to launch a marketing campaign, others want to franchise their
business and some need to build more product. It’s clear to the
entrepreneur why they need funding, but investors want to know,
“How does this make me money?” It is up to the entrepreneur to
effectively communicate how they can turn investor dollars into big
profits.

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 155

<-----Page 156----->If a funder asks, “Why do you need my money?” a bad response
would be, “We need your $200,000 to grow our business.” A better
answer is, “Your $200,000 will enable us to fulfill a recent order of
50,000 units of our product. The profit from the order alone will
total $500,000.” With the first response the pitcher is just begging
for money, with no plan on how to spend it. In the second they’ve
outlined a clear plan for the investor to make a profit.
When early stage investors make an investment, they aim to make
10 to 20x their money back within five years. One way they can
make money on an investment is through dividends, which is a share
of the profits, but it is unlikely this will total 10x their investment.
They can also profit by selling their percentage of the business at a
later date, which can be done in the following ways:
•	IPO: The business goes public, which is a very rare
	occurrence.
•	Merger & Acquisition: A larger company buys the business,
	 which is a rare occurrence.
•	Buyback Equity: The entrepreneur buys the investor’s
	 shares back with profits, which is almost impossible to do.
A more unfortunate but common investor scenario is bankruptcy.
To avoid the risk of losing their investment, investors want a clear
vision of how they will make their money back.

Why it matters?
On day one, all Startups have the chance at a future exit. But some
are more obvious than others. When a company has IP, market
traction, a sustainable competitive differentiator in a rapidly
growing market with large barriers to entry, it is setting itself up
for a successful exit. If Ambush Exposure is high, and it is easier to
build rather than buy, then 800 lbs. Gorillas will be more likely to
simply create a competing system.

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 157----->By locking up distributors, creating high customer-sunk costs and
protecting key IP, a company can increase the probability of a
successful exit.
Business is for profit. Monetizing an opportunity and crystalizing
the future value are intrinsic in your Startup should be the goal of
all entrepreneurs. Likewise, investors want to invest their money,
watch it grow and then get it back. For most investors, your Startup
must be able facilitate an exit in 4-7 years.

Questions to Ask
In a few years, after hitting your numbers, who would benefit from
buying your company? Which 800 lbs. Gorilla would be smart to
buy you? How have you made it better to buy your venture rather
than build a competitive solution?

Government Regulation
What is it?
Does your venture require (and possess) government approval?
Many industries are regulated by some level of government.
In order to participate in that market a license may be needed.
Government Regulations may require testing, evidence, or even
compliance with certain standards.

Why it matters?
Government regulation can act as a barrier to entry; for example,
regulation can significantly impact the cost to launch a product. In
other cases, government regulations may influence how you sell
and even where you can sell your solution.

Examples in Action
If you wish to open an institutional lending operation like a trust
company, most countries require you meet certain standards
(e.g., cash reserves), conduct business a certain way (e.g., can’t
loan millions to children under 18), or even comply with filing
requirements (e.g., monthly transfer report). In some cases,
governments can even require you to avoid selling your solution to
certain groups (e.g., anti-money laundering rules).

Questions to Ask
What role does the government play in your industry? What
regulations will you need to follow? How much will it cost (money,
time, energy, etc.) to comply annually? Before your customers buy
your solution/service/product, what approvals are needed?

<-----Page 161----->Element 31: Partnership Status
What is it?
Does the Startup have partners? Do you know any of them by name?
Do these partnerships materially increase either your confidence or
probability of success for the Startup? If yes, then the venture is
experiencing what scholars call the Halo effect.
The Halo Effect occurs when one entity (company, investor, person)
tacitly endorses another by agreeing to work with them. Many
Startups use the Halo Effect as a form of Proof of Concept.
As discussed earlier, Signalling Theory in economics refers to the
impact one party’s actions have on the perceptions of others.
Under Signalling Theory, the halo effect caused by partners is seen
as an endorsement. Take for example the following:
Startup WYZ is in the Search industry. They claim to have invented a
way to search images (something the search industry has struggled
to address). On day one, they pitch investors “the solution to image
search” but the live demo fails and investors lose confidence in the
opportunity. The next day, the founders of Startup WYZ announce
they have entered a partnership with Google, to leverage their IP
and expand the market. Regardless of how investors felt before the
announcement, Google’s signalling and halo will raise the level of
interest in the opportunity.

Why it matters?
I’ve never met an entrepreneur who wasn’t “in love” with her
venture. That’s the nature of entrepreneurship. Since all investors
hear these claims from every entrepreneur (Who hasn’t claimed to
be the next Google? Twitter? Facebook?), opportunity evaluators
must discount these claims altogether. But if you can’t believe the

<-----Page 162----->founders (when they say this is the next big thing!), who can you
rely on?
First and foremost, as we have already discussed, sales and customers
are the best testament to an opportunity’s potential (see Element
XX: Proof of Concept). But what if sales aren’t forthcoming? What
if the Startup is pre-revenue? In that case, the second best proof
of concept comes from Partnerships with known industry entities.
Partnerships come in all shapes and sizes, but generally the ideal
partnership will see the partner allocating (cash equivalent)
resources to enhance the probability of venture success.
Partnerships should advance the progress of the venture, but also
increase the confidence you have in it. After all, if BIG COMPANY X
thinks the company has value enough to partner with them, then
maybe there is something there.

Examples in Action
As an opportunity evaluator, I know little about pharmaceutical R&D.
But if a venture came to me with several large material partners
already on board (for example, a leading hospital, a leading lab,
a leading university or even a leading pharmaceutical company) I
would glean confidence from such and say: Well, I don’t know how
to judge this industry, but those that do seem to like what your
venture is doing are impressed…

How to Score
•	-10 if …competitive ventures have already partnered with
	 key players.
•	-5 if …no partnerships are in place.
•	0 if …the Startup has begun early talks with potential
	partners.
•	5 if …the Startup has established a partnership with a large
	 significant entity, but execution is still months away.

Note:
This element only covers true partnerships. A true partnership sees
both parties contributing to the solution time, energy, bandwidth
and resources. Some students mistake distribution agreements for
partnerships. If you sell Microsoft® Word as a distributor, Microsoft®
will call you their partner, but you would not score high on this
element (since it is a really a distribution deal not a partnership).
However you would score high on element #20). To score high
on this element a partnership must be mutually beneficial and
interdependent.

•	How the product will attract customers,
•	How the business will roll out, and
•	How the business can ramp up further.
As you can see, this collection of elements deals with the HOW not
the why of the venture. How will you get customers to buy? How
will you get product to the market? How will you scale up? What
keys mitigate your ability to grow? For these elements opportunity
evaluators are best to look for answers that are reasonable, not
right.
After all, it is impossible to predict the future. So instead of being
correct, investors often use a different standard. Reasonable not
right. Too many inventors try to convince others they are correct.
They know it all.
Instead, innovators are advised to show the assumptions behind the
plan and inform the reviewers that, based on those assumptions,
this is the plan. By striving to be reasonable but not necessarily
right, innovators instil confidence in investors.

What is it?
In today’s world, markets can shift rapidly and what is true on the
day the idea takes shape may not be true by the time that idea goes
on sale.

Why it matters?
The longer it takes to launch, the more chances of something going
wrong.

Examples in Action
If you are hoping to build an application for the iPhone, then your
time to launch ends with the listing of your app in the App Store. The
longer it takes to do that, the more chance there is for a competitor
to undermine your opportunity (for example, perhaps a competitor
launches before you).

Questions to Ask
How long until the product/service/solution is ready to sell? Since
beginning work on this innovation, what assumptions have turned
out to be untrue? How has the market for your solution changed in
the last year?

How to Score
For this element, score a:

•	0 if …launch is less than 6 months away.
•	5 if …the solution has launched.
•	10 if …the solution has already launched and has made
	 significant sales.

Raising the Score
To increase this element’s score, start with a Beachhead. A
beachhead is a military term for establishing a foothold on the
ground before launching a full press attack. In the world of
Startups, a Beachhead refers to a small, easily accessible, feasibly
manageable initial target group. By doing so, launch costs and time
go down, and the venture is able to generate early feedback before
investing largely into a go to market plan.
Facebook™ famously started only allowing students on university
campuses to join (actually they started with an even smaller
beachhead – Harvard University). Originally, to join Facebook™
a user needed an email that ended with .edu. This allowed the
founders, to create a minimal viable product geared to addressing
an unmet need in a manageable target market (i.e. students need to
connect). To give confidence on your good to market plan, consider
which target market might be an ideal beachhead for you.

What is it?
Ideas cost time, money, management bandwidth and resources to
get to market. The larger these costs, the more at risk, the lower
the score on this element.

Why it matters?
Until an innovation is sold, there is always Market Risk. Until an
innovation has sales traction, there is always the chance that the
market will reject the innovation. As a result, entrepreneurs should
try to mitigate costs to launch as soon as possible so that revenue
can start coming in.

Questions to Ask
How much have you invested so far into this opportunity? What
is left to do before you can try selling it? What costs have to be
incurred before the opportunity can generate revenue?

How to Score
For this element, score a:
	
•	10 if …it is too early to quantify cost of launch.
•	-5 if … costs to launch > sales to date
•	0 if …costs to launch = sales to date.

<-----Page 170-----><-----Page 171----->Element 34: Plan to Scale
What is it?
According to The Startup Genome Project’s recent report41, the
number one cause of Startup failure is Premature Scaling. The
authors of the project estimate that 74 percent of high growth
Internet Startups fail due to premature scaling.
What is premature scaling? The authors at the Startup Genome
Project define it as “focusing on one dimension of the business and
advancing it out of sync with the rest of the operation.” Or, in plain
English: when a Startup grows too fast, spends too much, and then
finds revenue being outpaced by expenses.

Why it matters?
Entrepreneurs can fall into the this trap by overspending on
customer acquisition, by confusing early adopters with a larger
market segment or by shifting engineering resources out of R&D
and into technical support too quickly. None of these tasks is
damning alone; it is only the timing that impacts the potential for
success.

Examples in Action
Mrs. D. has invented a biodegradable toilet paper that degrades
10x faster than all other toilet paper. She files her patent on her
product, but before going to market to see if customers want her
innovation, she decides to corner the market on her paper’s key
ingredient.

<-----Page 172----->Doing so costs her millions of dollars but ensures she is the only one
who can sell her product. A year later, she has cornered the market
on the supply of highly biodegradable toilet paper. Unfortunately,
Mrs. D. didn’t pilot test or focus group her innovation with real
customers. As a result, Mrs. D. was shocked to learn that end users
don’t like her product. So much so that her customers (the large
distributors of toilet paper) won’t carry it (they already sell cheap
non-biodegradable toilet paper). Mrs. D. has prematurely scaled
her business.

How to Score
For this element, score a:
•	-10 if …ARPU exceeds COCA.
•	-5 if ...scaling doesn’t match revenue growth.
•	0 if …it is too early (e.g., products not ready for sale)
•	5 if …the founders are holding off growth until sales justify
	such.
•	10 if …revenue far exceeds cost of goods and cost of
	 customer acquisition.

<-----Page 173----->Element 35: Reasonable not Right
What is it?
Most opportunities are made up of potential value. However,
predicting the future is impossible. That doesn’t stop so many
entrepreneurs from announcing that their 5 year future revenue
forecast is conservative. In fact, many entrepreneurs misunderstand
the motivation behind investors’ interest in future results. Investors,
and I reckon all opportunity evaluators, prefer reasonable to right.

Why it matters?
Since it is impossible to predict your revenue in five years,
entrepreneurs should spend less time trying to prove their number
is correct. Instead, founders should share the assumptions that
lead to these numbers. In doing so, opportunity evaluators should
look for what is reasonable and not what is right.

How to Score
For this element, score a:
•	-10 if …founders try to convince you they are correct.
•	-5 if ...assumptions are simply a “best guess”.
•	0 if …projections never arise.
•	5 if …the founders’ assumptions are based on dialogue with
	 future clients.
•	10 if …all assumptions have been tested and confirmed by
	 the market.

The Art of Financial Forecasting
By John Pinsent, CA, ICD.D
Senior Partner, St. Arnaud Pinsent Steman, Chartered Accountants

Effective financial forecasting is an entrepreneurs’ business GPS.
Financial forecasting allows entrepreneurs know accurately and
objectively where they are (along the route to success), where
they want to get to and most importantly, allows the entrepreneur
to receive helpful instructions along the way. For first time
entrepreneurs, the task of creating financial statements, and the
financial model that underlies them, is even more daunting. Having
never walked this path before, entrepreneurs often barely know
where the “on” button is, let along how to navigate to the mythical
“exit” that is their final destination. The good news is that many
prior travellers on the road to Startup success have walked this path
before you. The bad news is, most of these same entrepreneurs
have gotten lost along the way! But if you keep to the basics and
stay the course of best practices, then perhaps you too can learn to
navigate the highway of effective financial forecasting.
As an angel investor, your financial forecast is the third most
important thing that I’ll consider as I’m contemplating my
investment. First and foremost, I need to like you and your team.
Are you people that I can trust? Do you have the skills necessary
to build a valuable enterprise? Second, I need to really like your
Page 174 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 175----->concept. Is it unique? Can I imagine people engaging with it and is
it the kind of business that I would be proud to be associated with?
Can I offer more than cash? Once you’ve cleared these two hurdles,
team and idea, then (and only then) will I turn my attention to your
financial forecasts. Like team and idea, financial forecasts while
varied, can quickly help me make that all important first decisions:
Do I want to hear more?
Why are financial forecasts so important? The simple answer is
that these key documents tell investors a TON about you and your
business. By reviewing your forecasts, we will learn a lot about your
market, your margins and your business mechanics. Through this
careful analysis, we’ll discover much of what investors need to know
about how you nice founders are going to take my hard earned
money and hopefully turn this great idea into a health profit for us
all. But we learn more than just the numbers from your financials.
We also learn the level of Business Acumen of your team. Business
acumen ensures that the financials are realistic, achievable and
most of all based on grounded real life experience and reasonable
assumptions. You don’t have to be right, but you do have to be
reasonable.
Your financial forecasts also serve to set the tone for how the
investment is going to be valued and what an investors’ expected rate
of return will be. If your forecasts are so far off the road of realism,
then you’ve sent me a clear message that you don’t understand
your business, your market or your ability to capture value from
both. If your financial forecasts are excessively conservative, then
you run the risk of losing my interest by failing to hit my return
on investment expectations. After all, no one wants to put $50,000
into a high risk venture, if the upside is only 10%.
Bill Gates often talks about how people over estimate what they
will achieve in the short term and underestimate what they will
realize over the long haul. I think he’s absolutely right! The art of
financial forecasting is finding that balance between operational
realism and infectious entrepreneurial optimism.

<-----Page 176----->If you want to impress me, as a potential investor, I suggest (and
after 20 years as an accountant and a decade as an angel investor
you should listen to me) all entrepreneurs keep the following things
in mind as you develop your financial forecasts:
1. Anchor in the Present: I’m going to intensely analyze the
	 first year or any period that the current round of financing
	 will cover. I’ll be interest in knowing how years two and three
	 are expected to play out but will put anything beyond year
	 2/3 down to pure optimistic speculation. The key is anchor
	 in the present and scale from there (e.g., we are projected
	 $100,000 in year 1 revenue, and are pushing to double that
	 in year 2 and again in year 3). Make sure the plan for the
	 next year holds water!
2. Forget the Exit: Unless you’ve built and sold a business
	 SEVERAL times before, I know that you don’t have a clue
	 about where this opportunity will take us. So, don’t be afraid
	 to dream big but know that the valuation for the purposes of
	 my investment will rest on the details of the next 12 months.
3. Bottom-up, not top-down: Your financial forecasts have
	 to be tied to your operational realities. If you are projecting
	 sales of $2 million, then the assumptions upon which your
	 financial forecast are build must include staffing, advertising,
	 travel and marketing budgets that can realistically expect
	 to deliver that level of sales activity. For instance. if each
	 salesperson can make 10 sales calls a day, with an average
	 sale of $10,000 and close rate of 50%, then to reach
	 $2,000,000: you would need 200 sales. 200 sales would take
	 40 days of 1 salesperson, Same thing on the cost side of the
	 financials. If you have product engineering work to be done,
	 then the number of project hours needed to complete that
Page 176 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 177----->	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

work must tie into a head count and related staffing budget
that can deliver those hours. At the end of the day, you’ll be
held accountable for how investment dollars are spent.
What your financial forecast should show investors is that
your business will include an accountability framework
that will ensure that your targets can be achieved within the
timelines and budget dollars you are projecting. Remember,
no one expects you to be right, just reasonable.

4. Ask for Directions. Founders all have different levels of
	 financial acumen, notwithstanding all founders should
	 ground their projections in reality. One way to do that is to
	 ask for directions. Solicit input on your financials from those
	 who have been there, done that. Test your assumptions with
	 future clients, with potential suppliers, with advisors.
	 Frankly, the more you test your assumptions and adjust
	 according to third party feedback, the more comfortable
	 most investors will be.
5. Plan macro and execute micro. Investors understand that
	 it is VERY difficult to accurately predict the path that the
	 commercialization of your product or concept will take.
	 I need to see and understand the financial framework at
	 a macro level. The details and assumptions below that level
	 should give me the confidence that you’ve thought of all
	 those details through and have a plan to execute at that
	 micro level. If you win me over on the framework, I’ll give
	 you the rope to execute at the day to day level.
6. Fresh and evolved. Keep your forecasts fresh and your
	 assumptions fluid. If your forecasts are for the current year
	 and we’re already in December, they really don’t have much
	 value to me. Prepare your forecasts so that they can roll

Hot or Not? Page 177

<-----Page 178----->	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

with your investments tranches and operational milestones
as they are realized. Ensure that you can update your
forecasts in real time to reflect operational realities such as
not being able to fill a key management role at the exact
time you thought it would be filled. Generally, the software
that you use to build your forecasts will allow for dynamic
updates to assumptions and key input variables. Stay
current with all of the key data points. Remember, you will be
expected to ground your financials in reality. So if you missed
your sales target, you can’t simply reforecast it retroactively
to address the issue. You must instead, understand why the
sales target was missed, and adjust the assumptions in the
financial model instead.

In the end, as the investor I want you to paint me a financial picture
that captures my imagination and my pocketbook. Show me the
roadmap of the investment highway that you wish us to drive down
together. If you integrate your framework into realistic details that
you’re prepared to be held accountable to, then investors will have
the basis upon which they can comfortably move forward with.
And in this turbulent economy, I want to comfortable ride, to an
awesome destination, with a reliable driver (founder). Investors are
not afraid of getting lost, they’re just afraid to drive with founders
who won’t stop to ask for directions.

<-----Page 179----->Element 36: Accomplished to Date
What is it?
Since the future is unpredictable, one can often benefit from
looking at the recent past. As a result, all opportunity evaluators
should ask: What have you accomplished to date?
Ideally, a pitcher should cover the milestones they have
accomplished and the resources it took to accomplish such.

Why it matters?
As discussed above there is no way to know the future with any
degree of certainly. While past activities are not solely predictive
of future success, many investors look to the founder’s handling
of their personal investment in the venture as an indicator of how
those founders might handle a future investment.

How to Score:
For this element, score a:
•	-10 if …the founders failed to hit prior milestones.
•	-5 if ...the founders are unclear on prior goals.
•	0 if …it is too early to tell.
•	5 if …the founders’ have used their resources well but have
	 only accomplished some of their targets.
•	10 if …the opportunity has a solid recent track record
	 illustrating an ability to get things accomplished and meet
	goals.

<-----Page 180-----><-----Page 181----->Element 37: Plan B
What is it?
In ten years of venture investing, I have never seen a business end
up where it predicted it would be. I have never seen a successful exit
match up with the plans set in motion years before. Things change,
and innovation things change quickly. As result, every opportunity
needs a back-up plan, a Plan B. In fact, have a Plan C and Plan D as
well.
Ideally your innovation, solution or service has multiple uses or
multiple user types. For example, a billing software for law firms
could probably also do well in accounting firms but it might also
be used for non-billing purposes. Understanding all the various
opportunities for monetization is key at the evaluation stage.
After all, Viagra® was originally developed as a heart medication.
However, it was the positive side effects that led to the drug’s wide
spread adoption.

Why it matters?
As discussed above there is no way to know the future with any
degree of certainly. Things change. Competitors arrive. Governments
repeal regulations. Key staff leave. You simply can’t put all your eggs
in one basket. Instead, opportunity evaluators should look not to
the content or viability of Plan Bs, but to the entrepreneur’s ability
to formulate such in a reasonable manner.
TIP: Investors often say: don’t try to boil the ocean. By this they are
suggesting the innovator focus on the main opportunity and not all
the options. So it is important that in any opportunity presentation
(live or in a business plan) founders focus on the main opportunity;
only reference secondary options when asked. If you lay out Plans
A, B, C, D simultaneously you may leave opportunity evaluators

<-----Page 182----->with the impression you are unfocused.

Examples in Action
The best-selling drug, Viagra® was originally tested as a heart
medication. Yet it is Viagra’s Plan B that made it famous. (note:
Viagra found an additional (Plan C) market in high-altitude mountain
climbers who take it to prevent life-threatening edemas).

How to Score:
For this element, score a:
•	-10 if …the founders say they don’t need a Plan B.
•	-5 if ...the founders can’t articulate a Plan B.
•	0 if …plan B is mentioned, but seems unrealistic.
•	5 if …plan B is known but still untested.
•	10 if …proof of the viability of Plan B is provided.

<-----Page 183----->Element 38: Revenue Model
What is it?
Every entrepreneur eventually needs money. Some want the money
to launch a marketing campaign, others want to franchise their
business and some need to build more product. It’s clear to the
entrepreneur why they need funding, but investors want to know,
“How does this make me money?” It is up to the entrepreneur to
effectively communicate how they can turn investor dollars into big
profits.
If a funder asks, “Why do you need my money?” a bad response
would be, “We need your $200,000 to grow our business.” A better
answer is, “Your $200,000 will enable us to fulfill a recent order of
50,000 units of our product. The profit from the order alone will
total $500,000.” With the first response the pitcher is just begging
for money, with no plan on how to spend it. In the second they’ve
outlined a clear plan for the investor to make a profit.
The term Revenue Model refers simply to how you plan to
monetize (i.e., make money from) the innovation, product, service
or solution. There is an ever-increasing number of revenue models.
It is beyond the scope of the text to thoroughly explore all of these
but for explanatory purpose, here are just a few:

Model

Client pays

Per seat

a few for each user.

Example

Per unit

A one time for each use. Shoes

HR billing system

Recurring Revenue A monthly recurring fee. AAA emergency services
Freemium

Nothing upfront but
pays for extras

Gmail

One of the advantages of having thought about various revenue

<-----Page 184----->models is that it allows you to set up for the Double Dip. Double
dipping is the concept of building a solution once, selling it twice
and making money from it three ways. Consider the example below.

Examples in action
I served as the business advisor for a hit TV show for five seasons.
I was paid for this service. Then I double dipped by selling keynote
addresses based on the work I did on Dragons’ Den. Then I tripled
dipped by turning that content into this book.
Any product that can generate revenues from multiple sources will
be seen as having a higher probability of success. Double dipping
can help outline a Plan B or can be used to afford the venture
flexibility in pricing. Gillette® makes so much money from selling
disposable razor blades they can afford to give away the razors (i.e.,
a freemium model).

Why it matters?
I started my career as an opportunity valuator during the 1990s
(what would later be known as the dot.com bubble). Even in
the Internet’s “gold rush” days, it seemed unconscionable to me
that entrepreneurs would be seeking capital prior to knowing
how money will be made, but many had a blind faith that their
online business would succeed. Even ten years later, I still run into
innovators looking for millions in funding, prior to determining how
the innovation will be monetized.

How to Score:
For this element, score a:
•	-10 if …no model is presented.
Page 184 Hot or Not?

<-----Page 185----->•	-5 if ...the model presented is unrealistic.

<-----Page 186-----><-----Page 187----->Pitch
The next set of elements deal with the Pitch. These elements
combined make up only approximately 5% of the WiseGuide™
score. In most meetings, entrepreneurs will lead with what is
commonly referred to as an Elevator Pitch42.
For entrepreneurs, a good pitch is needed no matter the task at
hand. Want to raise capital? You need to pitch your plan. Want to
attract top notch employees? You need to pitch your vision. Want
to attract strategic partners? You need to pitch the benefits of
working together. Want to increase sales? You need to pitch your
solution. The ability to get your key message across in a meaningful,
compelling, and concise manner is one of the entrepreneur’s most
necessary skill sets. It is remarkable then, that it is also one of the
least honed skills.
By Pitch we refer to the presentation of the opportunity (both orally
and in writing). Many investors have a long held belief around the
value of an entrepreneur’s pitching ability. Many investors see a
causal link between “ability to pitch” and “venture success”. Even
more believe that founders who can’t pitch are doomed. This
is based on the issue of scarce resources. Without the ability to
convince others of the merit of your innovation, founders wills
struggle to attract investors, employees, partners and customers.

<-----Page 188-----><-----Page 189----->Element 39: The Elevator Pitch
What is it?
The MIT Enterprise Forum defines an Elevator Pitch as: “A one
minute description of a company designed to encourage the
audience to become investors, employees, or customers.” I define
an Elevator Pitch as: A clear, concise, compelling combination of
the pain your venture is addressing and the value proposition your
business is providing.
A good elevator pitch is made up of two key components: the pain
statement and the value proposition. The pain statement clearly
outlines the need for the product and hopefully includes some
sense of market size. The value proposition addresses what value
the solution will bring. These two elements can be summarized as
follows:
1. The pain statement: What problem does this solve? For
example, people want to have sex longer than their bodies
will allow.
2. The value proposition: How does it solve this problem?
Our blue, FDA approved pill allows them to do so in a cost
effective, non-embarrassing clinic

Why it matters?
Entrepreneurs who can’t pitch in a compelling way may worry their
financial backers. After all, if those closest to the innovation can’t
explain why it is needed and why it is potentially lucrative, who
will?
Founders who pitch poorly are a concern to most investors.
Remember, pitching isn’t just for capital. Even when you go to
© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 189

<-----Page 190----->recruit a board member (see Element 8), you are pitching. When
you try to attract early sales, you are pitching. When you try to
convince partners to sign on, you are pitching.

Examples in Action
Here is one of my favourite elevator pitches:
People want to have sex but sometimes the body doesn’t
function adequately. Our aspirin-sized FDA approved
blue pill will help our customers to have more sex without
embarrassment, discomfort or a change to their daily lives.
Obviously, this is an imaginary pitch for Viagra® but it clearly
demonstrates the two key components of a good pitch. It also
passes all four tests of a good elevator pitch:
1) It is CONSISE—more than two minutes is too long;
2) It is CLEAR and easy to understand—no jargon allowed;
3) It is COMPELLING—it induces greed; and
4) It is IRREFUTIBLE—the statements are hard to deny.
Here is another of my favourite pitches:
One person’s trash is another person’s treasure. Our online
global garage sale brings together buyers and sellers from
around the world. Some are looking to sell what they consider
trash. Others want to buy what they consider to be treasure.
All benefit from the proprietary trust platform we have
created, maintained and enhanced for the last 10 years.
What is this a pitch for? EBay of course. Elevator Pitching is so
important, we should pause for a moment to allow you to explore
the process of creating an elevator pitch yourself.

Page 190 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 191----->In the above example, four key elements are used to sell the idea
to an investor:
•	Irrefutable: It’s pretty safe to say there are plenty of people
	 whose appetite for sex is greater than their bodies can allow.
	 Since it’s clinically proven and FDA approved, it’s difficult to
	 show that the product is not safe and effective.
•	Easily understandable: The pitch is kept simple, avoiding
	 complex business or scientific terms.
•	Succinct: The pitch is kept short. Most people will give
	 you a small amount of their attention before they tune out.
	 Investors hear hundreds of pitches, make the most of their
	 time.
•	Greed inducing: The thought of joining this business should
	 make any investor feel like they will make lots of money. The
	 moment an investor can see and feel the greed, they are in.
Creating an emotional connection between your product and your
audience is the best way to motivate the consumer to buy. For
example, the Shamwow pitch to customers activates that annoying
feeling they get when cleaning up a big spill with paper towels
which will have to be replaced.
Catherine Langin pitched investors the Miners’ Lunchbox, which
has been available for sale for over 50 years. She shared the rich
history of their product, and the inventor Leo May, which brought
a feeling of nostalgia. After she confirmed they have made money
in the past, one investor proclaimed “I love the story but I love to
hear that you made money”. Catherine then explained, “Leo May
has sold over 1 million lunch boxes”. As soon as she said that, she
impressed the funders, they felt the greed and understood it was a
product that could make them money.
Next time you’re watching Shark Tank and a commercial comes on,
try to guess the feeling the commercial is trying to activate. Try to

providing, and notice the key elements in them. If you can do that,
you’re well on your way to creating your own great pitch.

•	meet the 4 key criteria listed above,
•	lead with a pain statement, and
•	close with the value proposition.

<-----Page 194-----><-----Page 195----->Element 40: Q&A
What is it?
While most pitches (internal or external) usually begin with the
Elevator Pitch, they almost always end with questions being asked.
In my experience, it is more than just the answers being given that
opportunity evaluators should review. Reviewers should also watch
how the answers are delivered.
Has the presenter thought through the question or has he or she
simply given a canned answer? Do the entrepreneurs get frustrated?
Do all team members presenting get involved? Do all founders give
the same answers? If an investor asks a question and disagrees with
the answer, how does the entrepreneur react?

Why it matters?
As discussed in the section on coaching and mentorship (see
Element 3) backing an idea is a dynamic process. One in which many
mistakes will made. How an entrepreneur interacts during Q&A can
often shed a light inside the founders’ business approach. Some
entrepreneurs see questions as a way of exploring deeper topics of
interest, a way to identify topics that the audience wishes to learn
more about. Other entrepreneurs see questions as an attack on the
opportunity. The former is ideal, the latter, not so much.

How to Score:
For this element, score a:
•	10 if …questions from the audience were poorly addressed.
•	-5 if …the entrepreneurs contradict themselves during Q&A.
•	0 if …there were no questions asked.

•	10 if …all questions were handled in an open, positive and
	 direct matter.

Raising the Score
To increase this element’s score, prepare a list of commonly asked
questions a reasonable reviewer might ask (see Appendix E) during
a pitch. Once you have this list, write out short answers to each.
Make sure all those participating in the presentation review both
the potential questions and the pre-created answers.
Reviewers may stray from your prepared questions, but following
process is sure to give your responses (and score) a boost.

<-----Page 197----->Proposal
The Proposal is worth only 5% of your total tally and this is because
this is the easiest element to adjust. A proposal in an investment
setting (like Shark Tank or Dragons’ Den) consists of at least two
elements: the ask and the offer. But I’d argue that the best proposals
contain two extra elements: the use and the results.
On TV you will often hear some variation of the following:
•	Hi, I’m Mrs. Smith from Smith Falls. We are seeking $100,000
	 for 20% equity in our business. I’d suggest a better proposal
	 would also include: (a) what the money is to be used for;
	 and (b) what results will it hopefully drive. Going back to
	 Mrs. Smith, a better pitch would be:
•	Hi, I’m Mrs. Smith from Smith Falls. We are seeking $100,000
	 for 20% equity in our business. We are going to use these
	 funds to add two new salespersons next quarter. With these
	 new resources, we will triple our revenues from last year
	 and end up with more than $1,500,000 in gross sales this
	year.
While it is impossible to predict the future, opportunity evaluators
want to gauge the Business Acumen of entrepreneurs pitching by
seeing if they have concrete uses for the capital requested and can
justify the proposal with potential results.

How much to Ask for?
Even how much you ask for (in funding) impacts how investors
see you. Ask for too little money and some investors will question
whether the money will have any real impact on the business or,
worse yet, if the company even needs the money at all. Ask for too
much money and you risk overpricing your company.

Hot or Not? Page 197

<-----Page 198----->So how much should you ask for? I recommend this staged approach.
1. Determine your next major milestone. This might be

	 importing inventory from Asia. Ask yourself: What is the
	 next big step and how much will it cost to make it happen?
2. Then see if you can get to your next milestone with less
	 money. The more you ask for, the more equity you will
	 probably have to give up.
3. Once you have the revised figure, turn your mind to your
	 company’s last year of sales. While not always true,
	 Dragons often use this figure, known as the 12 month
	 trailing revenue, as a starting point for valuation.
4. Ensure you aren’t asking for more money than you have
	 in sales; otherwise, you may have to offer up half of your
	company.
I recommend pitchers ask for just enough money to last 6-18
months or until you hit your next milestone. In the end it’s about
getting enough money to get to a point where Return on Investment
becomes possible.

<-----Page 199----->Element 41: Stage & Return
Potential Matches Request
What is it?
Can the resources requested be justified? Does the level of risk
match the timing of the venture? Is the risk justified by the potential
returns?
From a stage perspective, I have heard many Angel investors deploy
the following rule of thumb for consumer software applications:
•	0-1000 users 		
•	10,000 users		
•	100,000 users		
•	1,000,000 users	
•	5,000,000 users	
•	10,000,000 users	

invest	 $25,000
invest 	 $150,000
invest 	 $500,000
invest 	 $1,500,000
invest	 $2,500,000
invest	 $5,000,000

From a return perspective, Returns (also known as ROI, return on
investment, and money on exit) refer to how much money the
investors reap upon a successful exit from the investments.
Most exits occur when the Startup is sold to a bigger company (e.g.,
when Google buys your company) or when the company goes public
on the stock exchange (e.g., you launch a successful IPO on the TSX)
and, in rare cases, when the company is generating so much cash
flow that it makes sense to pay out the investor. The question then
becomes, how much should a Dragon get? Does an investor need
10x the money they invested? 20x the money they invested? How
big do the returns have to be to attract investor interest?
Most investors are looking to make enough returns on their wins
that will make up for all their Startup investments that didn’t

<-----Page 200----->succeed. Let’s look at an example.
•	If Investor #1 made 10 investments this year and all were for
	 $150,000, then in total he has invested $1,500,000. If only 1
	 in 10 Startups survive to the exit stage, then that one winner
	 must return $1,500,000 in order for Investor #1 to break
	 even (not counting for the opportunity cost, the time value
	 of money, and not counting a dozen or so other factors that
	 are complicated and beyond this scope).
There is, of course, a correlation between stage of venture and
needed ROI. The earlier the stage, the higher the risk. A company
with early sales has less overall risk than an idea-stage venture.
Further, as the level of risk rises (i.e., the earlier the stage) the
higher the ROI will needed to overcome opportunity costs.

Why it matters?
Money is always needed for businesses to do any activity.
Unfortunately, most of these activities cost a lot more than the
business has available, which is why entrepreneurs seek capital.
There are many people an entrepreneur can tap to acquire funding,
but where do you start? After all, all investors aren’t seeking the
same kind of investments.
Most investors want to match the amount invested with the stage of
the venture and with the potential returns with the risk level. Most
investors want entrepreneurs to have enough funding to reach the
next key milestone. Most investors would rather add additional
capital after that milestone has been met than invest it all upfront.
Further, entrepreneurs who ask for more than their stage can
validate are often seen as lacking Business Acumen.

<-----Page 202-----><-----Page 203----->Element 42: Enough Capital
to reach next milestone
What is it?
I’m often asked how much money entrepreneurs should attempt to
raise. In most investment circles the rule of thumb is:
Determine how much it takes to get to the next value
inflection point and add in 6 months as buffer.
An opportunity’s value goes up as risk goes down. Common value
inflection points include:
•	Selling first customers
•	Launching a product
•	Filing for patent
•	Scaling up to address another market
Value inflection points are milestones that increase the value of
the opportunity by mitigating risk. These eventually can be seen as
baby steps on the road to success.

Examples in Action
Katrina Mijares pitched Toddlerobics, and was asked by investors
why she needed the money. Her response was, “It will cover the
market research and advertising development” in order to establish
her product as a brand. This didn’t please investors, who responded:
“You haven’t come to the table with a process to establish that
brand. I hear no steps, there’s no branding.”

<-----Page 204----->Compare that to the response Trevor Bielby of Schmotoboard43
gave those same investors when asked why he needed the money.
Bielby’s response was, “to build up inventory, to put 100 of these
on the floor. I have stores in Calgary willing to sell them. I plan to
outsource, but with friends we can make 100 a week.” Trevor had
all the right answers in his pitch and gave investors the confidence
that he could turn their money into more money.
When seeking investors you have to provide them with a clear
vision of how they will make large profits from investing in you.

Questions to Ask
What was your last big milestone hit? What is your next milestone?
What will it meant to get there? Other than capital, what other
factors will impact how long it takes?

How to Score
For this element, score a:
•	-10 if …the capital requested will not be sufficient to get to
	 the next value inflection point.
•	-5 if ...capital sought is premature.

•	10 if …the capital sought will get the opportunity to the next

<-----Page 205----->Element 43: Realistic Valuation
What is it?
A private company can be valued on many different levels and
through many different methods (for example, cash flow, investment
to date, value of assets minus liabilities, future potential) but in the
end it is entirely subjective. Investors often evaluate a number of
key factors to decide at what price a deal makes sense to them.
Valuation is also about how much equity you are willing to give up,
what results the investment may garner and the future potential
returns the investment might generate.
So, “How do investors decide what a company is worth?” To be
blunt, they make it up. Based on the money invested to date, the
potential returns, the risk associated with the business, and their
decades of experience, the investors may make an offer.
The true value of the company is only known and set when both the
investor and the investee come to an agreement on the number.
Amongst other things, a deal sets the price (based on the terms
of the deal) but until you have a deal with external parties, no
value can be truly relied upon, especially values proposed by the
founders.

Why it matters?
Valuation (at what price are investors buying in at?) is a highly
subjective element at this end of the corporate spectrum. While
public companies have well established methodology’s for
determining venture valuation, new ideas have no such frameworks.
During the dot.com boom (1997-2000), page views (how many
times a user goes to your website) was seen as indicator of potential
value. During the Web 2.0 boom (2003-2007), number of registered
users became the metric of choice. In 2011, post-debt crisis, I’m not

and profits) are making a comeback.
To further complicate matters, a decade ago, $5,000,000+ was
necessary to get a product to market. In 2010, that number
dropped to $50,000. With such a low capital requirement, many
investors have shrugged off setting valuations and instead they
have attempted to simplify the process by offering standard terms
(for example, an incubator of seed stage software ventures, might
agree to invest $25,000 in return for 5%) not based on a particular
Startup, but based on a portfolio averaging approach (for example,
your Startup may be worth more, but since investors can’t prove
that, they turn to standards terms).

Examples in Action
An entrepreneur pitched the Pizza Pak44, a plastic pizza case that
would replace cardboard boxes, to a group of investors which
included International Pizza Magnate Jim Treliving (Chair of Boston
Pizza). The pitcher valuated his company at $1 Million, yet he has not
sold a single Pizza Pak. The founder claimed that his product would
revolutionize the pizza industry without any factual proof of sales
or customer testimonials. Even after Jim shared his expert opinion
that his product would not work, the entrepreneur persisted with
this idea anyway. The inflated valuation, the unsupported claims
and the wilful blindness that he knew the pizza industry better than
Jim, only lowered his level of credibility.

Questions to Ask
In return for the capital you seek, what percentage will your offer
me? What do you base this valuation on (Calculated using the %
and the cash being invested )? What proof can you provide that this
valuation is reasonable if not right?

If the valuation offered is reasonable based on stage and risk levels,

are from a realistic valuation, the lower this element will be scored.
TIP: In venture capital, valuation is set by the investors. So why ask
the founder what they think it is worth? Mostly, this is as a kneejerk test to detect if the founders have reasonable expectations.
Many investors, won’t even begin to explore an investment, if they
feel the valuation is simply too unrealistic.

<-----Page 208-----><-----Page 209----->Element 44: Investor Fit
What is it?
While cash is fungible, investors are not. Some investors bring more
than just cash to the table. Some can also add value through their
experiences, network or skill. In these cases we call that investor
Smart Money.

Why it matters?
Taking an innovation to market is a road fraught with obstacles,
challenges and hurdles. An investor who has: been there, done that
can add much more than simple cash. That’s why entrepreneurs
should actively seek smart money whenever possible. Likewise,
most investors are most comfortable funding innovations in
domains they are familiar with.

Examples in Action
Jim Treliving is smart money in both the food domain and the
franchise business. As a result, an investment from Jim yields more
than simple capital. Entrepreneurs backed by Jim get the benefit
of his decades of experience, can leverage his extensive network,
and may even benefit from the Halo Effect Jim brings to food deals.
In doing so, Jim is signalling the world, that the experts back this
business.

Questions to Ask
What, other than capital, would benefit your project? What
intangibles would accelerate adoption and growth?

Even after more than 10,000 pitches, there are some statements
that still turn my stomach. Some of these issues show a lack of
Business Acumen, others illustrate the dark side to the optimism
of entrepreneurship, other statements simply make the founders
look naïve. In this collection of elements, we will explore various
pitfalls that can undermine an opportunity evaluator’s confidence
in a company.
While the following issues illustrate some potential pitfalls all
reviewers should be wary of, this list is far from complete. Further,
some items (e.g., Taboo) are more subjectively offensive and
depend on the person undertaking the opportunity review.
Finally, it is worth noting that in the overall opportunity evaluation
process, detecting any of these red flags (a symbol of danger dating
back to the 18th Century, more recently used to refer to potential
hazards46) is reason to halt the process.
While these red flags or pitfalls are discussed after the WiseGuide™
elements, it would best practices to actually look at this issue before
beginning the formal review. In that way, these pitfalls become
gating items. Meaning once you spot a serious enough pitfall, you
may wish to halt the review.

<-----Page 214-----><-----Page 215----->Pitfall #2: Showstoppers
What is it?
Showstoppers are obstacles facing the entrepreneur. These
obstacles lower the probability of success for the venture.
Showstopper examples include (but aren’t limited to):
•	The market is wrong;
•	We haven’t found our customers yet;
•	We don’t own the solution;
•	Making money isn’t our primary goal;
•	Large Company X (e.g., Google, Ford, AT&T) just doesn’t get
	 it; or
•	We have no revenue model.

Why it matters?
Entrepreneurs need investors more than investors need
entrepreneurs. The supply of seed capital to drive innovation
is often dwarfed by the demand for such. As a result, the best
investors have many opportunities to review. In order to facilitate
screening, investors are always on the lookout for reasons to say
no. Include a showstopper in your opportunity presentation and
you give investors an easy out.

How to Score
The more showstoppers mentioned the bigger the pitfall.

<-----Page 216-----><-----Page 217----->Pitfall #3: Taboo
What is it?
Some industries are non-starters. Pornography, drugs, gambling
and other illicit activities are taboo and will encounter difficulty in
garnering support despite the fact that they may be lucrative. Even
secondary services to these industries (e.g., digital secure payments
for online casinos) can be shunned for support.

Why it matters?
Uber-investor Kevin O’Leary once commented that while he himself
didn’t have issues with innovations based in taboo fields, he still
wouldn’t support them. His reasoning was based on an inverse
Halo effect. Kevin felt that if he endorsed a taboo product (through
even passive investment) it might negatively impact his other
investments or even his other lines of business.

How to Score
Taboo is one of the few binary elements in the WiseGuide™. An
opportunity is either taboo or not). There really is very little middle
ground. Conversely, a very “feel good” solution, say to save wildlife,
could add weight to a pitch if your Startup represents an opportunity
for investors to enhance their altruistic or philanthropic side.

What is it?
Skin in the Game47 is an investment term referring to what the
entrepreneurs have invested to date in the opportunity. Having
skin in the game signals48 (see Signalling Theory) investors and
opportunity evaluators that the founders are committed to the
venture. After all, if founders don’t have their money invested and
at risk, why as an external investor, would I?

Why it matters?
Investors for the most part want entrepreneurs to have their capital
at risk prior to new capital being invested. There are many reasons
for this, including:
•	Without a personal stake in the opportunity, what keeps the
	 founder from quitting when things get tough?
•	If the founder¬¬s don’t believe enough in the idea to risk
	 their money; why should investors take the risk?
•	It aligns all shareholders to the same goals (profit
	 maximization).
Investors can become nervous when an entrepreneur doesn’t
believe strongly enough in their opportunity to risk their own
capital.

considered Skin in the Game. For a seasoned serial entrepreneur it
would take significantly more. Rest assured, no one requires you to

at risk as you backers, you will be seen as having Skin in the Game.

How to Score
Skin in the game is one of only a few elements in the WiseGuide™
that is binary. If the founders have skin in the game, then there is
very little reason to continue reviewing the venture.

Raising the Score
Sweat Equity is not heavily weighed by external investors. Instead
they look to actual cash contributed. To raise this element’s score,
some founders invest their own money upfront, and then use such
to pay themselves (as opposed to simply forgoing salary and living
off personal monies).

What is it?
Creating disruptive innovation is difficult. Getting it widely adopted
in the marketplace is almost impossible. But no matter the product,
service or solution, one thing remains true: it is hard work. Everyday
innovators struggle to overcome product hurdles, economic scarcity
and technological barriers. For that reason, most investors I know
have adopted a no @$$hole rule.
Simply put: bringing innovation to the market is hard enough
without having to deal with difficult personalities. Most investors
stay close to the company for a number of years, talking weekly,
if not daily, to the founders they have backed. Investors want to
ensure that the only source of stress comes from external forces,
not internal egos.

Why it matters?
I am not suggesting that if the entrepreneur is nice, everything will
be well. I am simply sharing the idiom: Life is simply too short to fill
it with friction.

How to Score
The less you want to work with the opportunity presenter the lower
the score. This is highly subjective and will change therefore from

What is it?
A Red Herring refers to a distraction that diverts attention from
a matter of importance. In opportunity evaluation, anything that
distracts from the process of scoring and due diligence is a red
herring.

Examples in Action
There is no definitive list of red herrings, but over the last ten years
of pitches, certain phrases have become so repugnant to me that
their presence in a pitch is distracting.
Here are few of my favourites:
•	“We have no competition.”
•	“Our financials are conservative.”
•	“If we get only 2% of the market…”
When entrepreneurs emote the statements above, this is how
investors interpret them:
•	“We have no competition” a Either you don’t know how to
	 use Google or it is a really bad idea.
•	“Our financials are conservative”a How can they be? In
	 most cases financials are pro formas (i.e., future predicting)
	 and are not based on experience.
•	“If we get only 2% of the market...”a Market adoption
	 should never be down top down—only bottom up.

<-----Page 225----->Pitfall #7: The Key
Person Dependency
What is it?
Wherever possible, find the best talent you can hire. Often these are
founders, inventors, and software coders. The term “key person”
comes from the insurance industry. Insurers sell a type of policy
called keyman Insurance. A “keyman,” or more appropriately a “key
person” is a founder that is vital not only to the innovation strategy
but he or she is also critical to the delivery process.
Kevin O’Leary is famous for asking innovators: “So what happens if
you get hit by a bus tomorrow? Does the business also die?” What
O’Leary is really exploring it the key person dependency issue. No
one wants to fund an opportunity where one person has that much
power.

Why it matters?
Scalability requires the innovation to be replicable. If a key person
is needed to replicate the value added to the customer each time,
then the business’s growth will be gated by the capacity of that key
founder.

Examples in Action
An artist is the key person in an art creation business. Without the
artist, there is no business. If that business sells original art (or even
limited prints) then the revenue is solely dependent on the artist’s
capacity to produce sellable art.
The patent holder is critical to an innovator’s business if future R&D
is going to be pursued. That is one of the key reasons that investors
don’t like Startups who license in their technology.

Own Kool-Aid™
What is it?
An echo chamber is, by definition, a hollow space that resonates
acoustics. While an echo chamber may be good for acoustics, but
it is not good for innovation. In innovation circles an entrepreneur
who only seeks and listens to feedback that agrees with her
position is said to be living in an echo chamber. Investors also refer
to founders who wilfully blind themselves to the issues at hand, as
drinking their own Kool-Aid™.

Why it matters?
An innovator who only discusses the opportunity or solution with
those in the inner circle fall prey to downside of drinking your own
Kool-Aid™. If you only listen to those who agree with you, then
it is likely you will bias your judgements. Many founders want to
hide their innovation from the world, afraid it could be stolen. But
truth be told, not showing your innovation, not getting exposure
to review and feedback, or not accepting input from sources which
disagree with you, is a recipe for disaster.
That is why so many innovators in the Lean Startup49 movement
push for sharing ideas early and sharing them often. If the only
people who have told you your idea is awesome are related to you,
you may have problem.
This is where third party validation comes back into the discussion.
Every entrepreneur I’ve ever met believes they have a good idea.

keepers.
Worse still, by not sharing and collaborating with potential
stakeholders, the innovator denies themselves a most valuable
element: customer engagement.
Note: Intellectual property should always be protected. In some
cases, patents can be invalidated by public disclosure.

Questions to Ask
In developing your solution, from whose input did you benefit most?
What feedback was given to the first industry people you showed
it to? Did that change over time? For example, have you been able
to develop your innovation and reflect on input as appropriate? Or
has it been consistent (everyone is telling you to go left, but you
insist on going right)?

How to Score
Either founders (or internal champions) are agile and open to
feedback or they are not. If they are not and if all confirming data
comes from close sources (i.e., friends and family) then that should
be a large red flag.
During season one of the TV show, I witnessed firsthand what I
consider to the best example of this pitfall in action. A hard working
entrepreneur was pitching a leather armchair that converted to
an all in one exercise unit50. To me it sounded like a horrible idea
but the entrepreneur was passionate about it. When asked why he
was so enthusiastic, the founder informed the potential investors:
Everyone I show this to says this is a great idea. They tell me it is a
great product.

inventor confessed that all feedback was direct (and only) from
friends and family (not outside neutral sources). Without the
unbiased view, and more importantly the understanding to seek
out such an unbiased view, this founder was demonstrating the
dangers of the echo changer.

Raising the Score
To increase this element’s score, share your idea with those who
can provide critical feedback, then incorporate such directly into
your pitch. Be sure to mention where you got the information from
as it will show you are open to the opinions of others and agile
enough to leverage such fully.

WiseGuide™ Case
From Wikipedia:
TiVo Inc. was incorporated on August 4, 1997 as “Teleworld, Inc.”
by Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay, veterans of Silicon Graphics and
Time Warner’s Full Service Network digital video system. Originally
intending to create a home network device, they later developed
the idea to record digitized video on a hard disk.
Teleworld began the first public trials of the TiVo device and
service in late 1998 in the San Francisco Bay area. After exhibiting
at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1999, Mike Ramsay
announced to the company that the first version of the TiVo digital
video recorder would ship on March 31, 1999, despite an estimated
four to five months of work remaining to complete the device.
Teleworld, Inc. changed its name to TiVo Inc. on July 21, 1999.
After exhibiting at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1999,
Mike Ramsay announced to the company that the first version of
the TiVo digital video recorder would ship “In Q1,” (the last day
of which is March 31) despite an estimated four to five months of
work remaining to complete the device.
In early 2000, TiVo partnered with electronics manufacturer
Thomson Multimedia (now Technicolor SA) and broadcaster British
Sky Broadcasting to deliver the TiVo service in the UK market. This
partnership resulted in the Thomson PVR10UK, a stand-alone
receiver released in October 2000 that was based on the original
reference design used in the United States by both Philips and Sony.
TiVo branded products returned to the UK during 2010 under an
exclusive partnership with cable television provider Virgin Media.
By 2008, 25% of TV households had DVR/Video on Demand. In
2010, a decade later, 80% of American Internet users had watched

Hot or Not? Page 247

<-----Page 248----->video online. By 2014, this number is forecasted to rise to 52.3
million users.

The Pitfalls:
The only relevant pitfall is the fact that DVR’s may undermine the TV
industry’s ability to monetize contents (since DVRs effectively let the
viewer fast-forward and skip the commercials). This would impact
the TV production industry. However, since it is the TV providers
(i.e., cable companies) who sell DVR services and equipment, this
may not be enough to block adoption.

The Elements
People
The team at Teleworld is working on the product full time. The
founders have worked together for more than 5 years. Jim Barton
and Mike Ramsay were veterans of Silicon Graphics and Time
Warner’s Full Service Network digital video system. While they have
not successfully exited a venture to date, they have successfully
worked together to bring products to market while employed
as a team at their last company. The group’s founders have both
Domain Knowledge and operational experience. For additional
Business Acumen, they rely heavily on a board of directors and
board of advisors. Both groups meet no less than twice a month,
demonstrating the coachability of the team at Teleworld. Because
of the strong leadership team, Teleworld has been able to attract
talent by offering employee stock options.

Pain
In 1998, if you wanted to record a show for later viewing a VCR and
blank tape were required. One needed some technical knowledge
to record a program (i.e., how to use and/or program a VCR).
Further, only one show could be taped at a time. Finally, although
Page 248 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 249----->widely adopted, VCRs were rarely used for recording. In fact, a 1998
BBC survey confirmed that although more than 70% of households
had a VCR, less than 10% had ever used the recording feature. VCR
tapes also produced very poor viewing quality.

Product
Watching TV is one the top leisure activities in the western world.
However, since the arrival of the Internet users want more control
over what (and when) they watch. Teleworld has patented the video
on demand technology, naming it DVR (digital video recorder) and
trademarked the term TiVo. They have worldwide rights exclusivity
for the next few decades as result.
The DVR can hold over 200 hours of content. A VCR can only hold
up to 90 minutes of content before an additional tape would be
required. As a result, the DVR is 10x better than the VCR when
it comes to storage. Many of those surveyed have never been
able to use their VCR to record content. Teleworld’s initial survey
information showed that 92% of the test audience found the DVR
to be at least 10x easier to use than the VCR.
Teleworld is currently the only provider of DVR technology, having
created it in house through R&D. As the TV cable companies seek
to offer more services to their users, Teleworld is in a great position
to monetize their invention. Currently their DVR’s cost $25 per unit
to manufacture and deliver. The TiVo product will retail for $199
and the distributing cable company will pay $100 wholesale to
Teleworld. As a result, the margins are strong not just for Teleworld
but for the cable companies that distribute them.
Before officially launching the product, the founders had already
signed a pilot deal with the BBC. This generated early revenue and
served as strong proof of concept.

© Sean Evan Wise

Hot or Not? Page 249

<-----Page 250----->Province
VCRs have created a market for content recording for over two
decades. However, adoption of the recording features has not be
widespread. There is only one other current competitive option for
recording TV content. However, this technology is 4x as expensive
as DVRs and Laser Disks can only hold 10 hours of content. Less
than ten percent of what the DVR can record.
Future competitors may include other set top box manufactures, but
due to the TiVo patents, it seems unlikely that others can break into
the digital recording set top box market. Notwithstanding this fact,
the founders can foresee a day (10-15 years in the future) where the
Internet may become the means of television production. If that
happens, Teleworld’s DVRs may no longer be needed. However,
over the next decade, the Teleworld founders believe they will be
able to leverage their IP to develop a DVR for the Internet.

Plan
After initial tests, and related press coverage, public demand for
the DVR accelerated. In early 2000, TiVo partnered with electronics
manufacturer Thomson Multimedia (now Technicolor SA) and
broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting to deliver the TiVo service in
the UK market. Teleworld plans to follow this strategy globally.
Scaling adoption will require cost effective access to various global
markets. The founder’s hope to replicate their approach in Canada,
Australia and the US, by leveraging cable operators to distribute the
TiVo, Teleworld can focus on product development and leave client
management to the operators.

Page 250 Hot or Not?

© Sean Evan Wise

<-----Page 251----->Pitch
The elevator pitch for TiVo was given as:
Millions of people worldwide miss their favourite shows
because they can’t record with their VCRs. VCRs are now two
decades old and most still flash “12:00” confirming that more
than 90% of VCR owners aren’t able to use the record feature.
Teleworld’s TiVo set top box makes recording easy for
everyone. Simply highlight the show you want to record on
the onscreen menu, and hit record. TiVo does the rest. Initial
testing has shown the TiVo is 10x easier than the VCR to
record with by 49 of 50 users.
Massive adoption, great margins and the huge barrier to entry
caused by Teleworld’s patents make rapid revenue growth a reality.
While it is still several years from the break-even point, Teleworld
has the proof of concept and early sales to show it is about to hit its
next value inflection point. The founders have properly mitigated
market, magic and management risk. Assuming that these seasoned
founders offered a high yield investment at a reasonable valuation,
one that matched the risk/return ratio of the investors, then we
would score the Proposal elements as 10s. Because of this, an
investment can be justified as the money would go to expansion.
The overall score for this opportunity is 87%.
