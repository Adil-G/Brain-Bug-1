Abstract
This paper seeks to identify and model the key parameters which impact on the commercial performance of a specialist,
technology focused, early-stage, venture capital fund. Using both input Žcosts. and output Žexpected values. data provided by
a number of specialist, independent venture capital firms, a spreadsheet model of a 10 year term fund is developed. These
figures are used to generate Internal Rate of Return ŽIRR. and Net Present Value ŽNPV. performance calculations for the
investment commitments of both the institutional, limited partners and venture capitalist, general partner. The generically
defined model allows the user to address both conceptual and pragmatic questions regarding the relationship between fund
structure and performance. The model is further developed to determine the effect on fund performance of two venture
capital related, ‘indirect’ State support schemes Žguarantee and leverage options.. Iterative interrogations of the model
demonstrate the sensitivity of economic returns to the scale of the investment activity. State supported schemes mitigate but
do not remove the negative performance consequences of small fund size. A fund with under £15 million ŽUS$25 million or
ECU21 million. under management is of increasing economic vulnerability. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
1.1. Industry context and policy interests
Policy measures to improve the formation and growth rates of New Technology Based Firms ŽNTBFs. are
increasingly popular in developed economies world wide. NTBFs have come to be recognised as a potentially
important constituent of an innovative and advanced economy. However, growing government interest and
intervention is also a recognition that technology-based businesses face particular difficulties. Provision of
finance through established capital markets for these young enterprises, which by definition are highly

speculative, frequently remains problematic. The traditional sources of finance for young firms at start-up,
namely the entrepreneur Žand hisrher family and friends. usually followed by collateral-based bank debt, may
be either insufficient or inappropriate to exploit fully the rapid growth potential of an attractive and novel
technological product or service ŽOakey, 1984a,b; Moore, 1993; Westhead and Storey, 1995..
In these circumstances, the provision of risk capital by venture capital firms may be the most suitable form of
external finance. However, outside the US and a number of advanced Western economies, notably the UK, the
venture capital industries of many countries remain immature and inexperienced. In addition, with the singular
exception of the US, the greater the experience of a venture capital sector, the more the tendency of the
incumbent venture capital firms and their institutional investors to move towards a preference for larger and less
risky ‘development capital’ deals. 1 This has lead to the situation where potentially attractive NTBFs have seen
constraints placed on the availability of, particularly, longer term risk capital ŽMurray and Lott, 1995.. This
capital scarcity, termed ‘the equity gap’ ŽMacmillan, 1931., has potentially serious, adverse consequences for
the NTBFs’ rate of growth ŽWesthead and Storey, 1995.. 2
A vigorous and growing community of NTBFs within an economy may produce significant ‘externalities’ of
interest to government. This is in addition to any benefits reaped by the commercial investors in such firms.
Accordingly, governments are frequently prepared to provide a range of incentives or subsidies to ensure that
sufficient finance and support are made available to early-stage investments in technology based, young firms.
The alleviation or attenuation of market failure frequently becomes the economic rational for such state
interventions.
One major constraint to the supply of long term or risk capital to NTBFs is the apparent inability of
technology focused, venture capital funds to provide attractive returns to their investors. European performance
statistics indicate that early-stage investments generate the lowest level of returns of any stage of venture capital
finance with pooled IRRs of 5.7% pa compared to 17.6% for MBO funds ŽVenture Economics and Bannock
Consulting, 1997.. This raises the question as to whether successful investment in NTBFs is a peculiarly
American phenomenon. 3 In extremis, is it solely a West or East Coast phenomenon ŽFlorida and Kenney,
1988.? These are questions of profound importance regarding both industry and technology policy for many
countries.
1.2. A European Commission response
Small and medium sized enterprises ŽSMEs. have assumed a growing influence in the policy actions and
instruments of the European Commission. This interest has come about through an increasing recognition of the
major contribution of SMEs to total employment and to the net creation of new jobs Žsee Birch, 1979; Gallagher
and Steward, 1986; Storey et al., 1989.. SMEs are now firmly established as a major focus of the Commission’s
economic, technological and regional policies. This interest may also be superficially evidenced by the fact that
there exists one Directorate General ŽDGXXIII. with a specific remit to promote the interests of the nearly 18
million SMEs in the Union. 4 However, the actual or potential influence of SMEs impacts across a wide range
of other DGs, notably DGXVI ŽRegional Policy. and DGXIII ŽInnovation..
The publication, European Industrial Policy for the 1990s notes the failure of European firms to bring high
technology, innovative products to the market as the speedily as competitor nations ŽEuropean Commission,

1

Development capital investments are generally described as those transactions involving established companies but not start-up or
early-stage enterprises.
2
It should be noted that several academics harbour significant reservations regarding the existence or degree of an equity gap for NTBFs.
See, for example, Aston Business School Ž1991..
3
The importance of recent Israeli activity must be recognised including the very strong links with American commerce and academe.
4
DGXXIII also has a remit for the promotion of Tourism.

1991, pp. 31 and 33.. The document highlights the shortage of technology-based, small firms available to
exploit and commercialise innovations in Europe. The problems of finance for these firms is also observed.
However, no specific policy prescriptions relating to finance are tendered. The subsequent White Paper Growth
and Employment: the Challenges and Ways Forward into the 21st Century ŽEuropean Commission, 1994.
reiterates both the need for more European NTBFs and policy makers’ concerns that Europe does not convert
sufficient of its science and technology base into commercially successful products and services. The validity of
the American exemplar, particularly the positive impact of new Žhigh tech. firm formation on aggregate
employment, is also again acknowledged. Specifically, the White Paper notes ‘‘the lack of risk capital to help
firms through the development phase and the reluctance of private-sector financiers to invest in activities if they
consider the risks too great or the returns too uncertain’’ Žp. 102..
It was left to the considerably more focused and bolder Green Paper on InnoÕation ŽEuropean Commission,
1995. to articulate specific policies to address the perceived problem of Europe’s weaker innovative infrastructure compared to the Japanese and, above all, the Americans. Acknowledging the importance of an appropriate
financial environment, the Green Paper describes in detail a series of barriers to innovation in a section entitled
‘Problems with Financing Ža. Financial systems which avoid innovation’ Žp. 39.. With rare candour the
document observes ‘‘ . . . that the European innovations system is full of holes’’. Existing financial institutions;
uncertainties and limits to public financing; and an unfavourable European tax regime are seen to be the greatest
financial barriers to innovation. Thirteen ‘actions’ are presented for discussion with Action 6 proposing ten
recommendations at national andror Community level Žpp. 52–53.. Within the venture fund context of this
paper, relevant Commission action proposals included ‘acquiring holdings in venture risk intermediaries’ or ‘the
possible support of the creation of multi-national new seed capital funds’ in order to promote the genesis and
development of NTBFs are highly apposite.
The First Action Plan for InnoÕation in Europe ŽEuropean Commission, 1997. was the end result of the
discussion process stemming from the Green Paper. Under the second of the three major foci of the First Action
Plan, ‘Establishing a Favourable Framework for Innovation’, the Commission committed itself to reinforcing
European Investment Fund action in favour of innovation and cooperation between the European Investment
Bank and the Structural Funds. The first tangible outcome of this statement was the launch in 1997 of the
InnoÕation and Technology Equity Capital scheme ŽI-TEC..
I-TEC explicitly recognises the additional costs in making early stage venture capital investments in
unproven NTBFs. Accordingly, a new or established venture capital fund which will contract to allocate at least
25% of new capital raised to early-stage investments in a minimum of five technologically innovative SMEs can
obtain up to a total of ECU500,000 in grant. This sum must be employed to defray the peculiar, additional costs
to the investor of initial appraisal and ‘hands on’ management of NTBF investee firms. I-TEC was announced in
1997. By the end of that year, nine venture capital funds had entered the Scheme providing a potential extra
source of risk capital of ECU186 million exclusively for early-stage, high-tech investments ŽEuropean
Commission, 1998..
It is interesting to note that, while the I-TEC scheme owes much to the political commitment engendered by
Edith Cresson Žthe Commissioner responsible for DGXIII. via the vehicles of the Green Paper and Action Plan,
the actual logic and operation of the new scheme was very heavily based on the experience the Commission
gained from the European Seed Capital Fund Scheme ŽMurray, 1998.. This ‘pilot action’ Ž1988–1995. was
sponsored by DGXXIII and DGXVI and not by DGXIII. The ESCF scheme was the first European initiative to
address the peculiar cost problems of exceptional information search and investee governance which are
experienced by early-stage technology venture funds. This phenomenon is central to the present paper and is
termed—The Second Tyranny: dis-economies of small fund size.
1.3. Genesis and growth of the Õenture capital industry
The modern venture capital industry, starting from its post-war roots in East Coast America ŽBygrave and
Timmons, 1992. has grown to become a significant element of the corporate financial services sector in virtually

<-----Page 3----->950

G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

every major economy. The concept of speculative, but potentially well rewarded, equity investments Žrisk
capital. in rapidly growing, unquoted companies has become increasingly popular with aggressively ambitious
owner-managers and institutional investors alike. Venture capital firms have mushroomed not only in the
traditional western economies of North America and Europe but also in the Pacific Rim and, latterly, the former
Soviet controlled states of Central and Eastern Europe.
While the USA continues to have the largest and longest established venture capital industry, Europe and
particularly the UK has similarly developed its own style of venture capital activity. European investment at
nearly ECU9.7 billion in 1997 ŽEuropean Venture Capital Association, 1998. is now of a scale broadly
equivalent in terms of the funds raised and invested each year to the US ŽNational Value Capital Association,
1998.. The growth which has characterised the US industry is also evident across the Atlantic. Both regions
have recently achieved record venture capital investment activity with the US and the UK having invested
domestically US$13.1 billion and £3.1 billion, respectively, in 1997. ŽFig. 1.
1.4. Demise of early-stage inÕestment actiÕity
As the European venture capital industries have grown in the scale and number of financing transactions, the
nature of their investment activity has significantly changed. Over time, the ‘ venturing’ aspect of this
investment with its concentration on start-up and early-stage businesses has declined. Instead, this so-called
‘classic venture capital’ has given way to a predominant interest in later-stage or ‘merchant capital’ deals.
Classic venture capital focuses on very young enterprises with a high but risky potential for substantial sales and
profit growth. Such firms have been termed ‘fast trackers’ ŽStorey et al., 1989. and, latterly, ‘ten percenters’
ŽStorey, 1997.. Storey et al. note that this minority of exceptional enterprises will contribute disproportionately
to desirable outcomes, eg. additional employment or total sales growth. In marked contrast, merchant capitalists
concentrate on the considerably less risky refinancing of existing and established businesses. Financing
management buy-outs and buy-ins ŽMBOsrMBIs. is the most popular and profitable activity within this latter
category.

The magnitude of the trend away from start-up and early-stage investments has most clearly been seen in the
dominant UK industry within Europe. However, with few exceptions Žof which the US is the most notable., this
demise of early-stage investment can be viewed as the prevalent mode of behaviour by venture capital sectors as
they become established. ŽTable 1.
1.5. Old and new worlds— old and new inÕestments
It is the ability of the US venture capital industry to continue to invest predominantly in young, and as yet
unestablished, technology based enterprises which differentiates it so dramatically from its major European
counterparts. This is in part a categorisation issue. The US does not include refinancing and restructuring type
acquisitions, commonly termed ‘leveraged buy-outs’, within the rubric of venture capital. However, this
explanation is not sufficient. When these statistics are removed from country comparison, the US venture capital
industry remains significantly more involved in technology-based investment activity than its European
counterparts Žsee Fig. 2..
This predominant technology focus in the US is in stark contrast to the UK where ‘low-tech’ management
buy-outs and buy-ins continue to be the dominant product and activity of the UK industry. In 1997,
MBOsrMBIs represented 65% by value of a record annual UK investment level and 31% of the volume of UK
financings. Start-up and other early-stage investments in the UK that same year represented £159 million or 5%
of total value of annual investment. This sum was allocated to 219 recipient companies ŽBritish Venture Capital
Association, 1998.. The figures for seed capital investments by members are not recorded by the British Venture
Capital Association but can be taken to be nugatory. For example, European Venture Capital Association figures
for 1997 indicate that only six such investments were made that year for the whole of the UK.
The Bank of England in its 1996 report, The Financing of Technology Based Small Firms, specifically noted
the very small proportion of monies which were allocated to seed and very early-stage venture capital
investments in the UK. The Bank also observed that this financing gap occurred at the most critical, early
growth stages for young entrepreneurial companies with potentially attractive technology ideas and future
products or services but with insufficient track record on which to secure more traditional financial support such
as bank debt.
1.6. The Õalue of NTBFs
For that minority of UK venture capital firms which are prepared to invest in start-up and early-stage
ventures, very demanding investment ‘hurdles’ are imposed on those investee firms seeking their financial
support. It is not uncommon for investment hurdles to be of the order of 60% pa Internal Rates of Return ŽIRR.
ŽMurray and Lott, 1995.. Accordingly, in practice, the terms ‘start-up’ and ‘early-stage’ have largely come to

Fig. 2. Value of technology investments as a percentage of ‘adjusted’ total value Ži.e., excluding MBOsrMBIs in the UK and Europe and
LBOsrAcquisitions in the US. by venture capital industries 1984–1996.

mean investments in NTBFs by specialist venture capital firms. NTBFs may be defined by their high levels of
investment in R & D as a percentage of sales and their predominance of ‘knowledge workers’ within the labour
force ŽOrganisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, 1986; Butchart, 1987.. Fontes and Coombs
Ž1997., p.17, more generally define NTBFs as ‘‘young independent firms involved in the development andror
diffusion of new technologies’’. Despite the risks and uncertainties of technology based investments Žsee
below., the ‘upside’ to the investors is the highly attractive prospect of investing in a firm with new and
proprietary technology and which may come to command a dominant presence in large, profitable and rapidly
growing international markets.
Further, Žbut of no rational economic interest to professional, private sector investors., within the wider
corpus of SMEs, NTBFs represent a peculiarly attractive focus for policy makers. They are seen as offering
significant potential benefits in four cardinal areas of governmental interest: employment creation, innovation,
export sales growth and regional development ŽRothwell and Zegveld, 1982; Freeman, 1983; Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development, 1986; Oakey et al., 1988; Rothwell, 1989; Roberts, 1991; Coopers
and Lybrand, 1996; Branscombe and Keller, 1997.. This interest in NTBFs has in part stemmed from a
widespread appreciation of their critical role from the early 1970s in the economic growth of regions of high
technology activity in the USA, particularly Silicon Valley, CA and Route 128 around Boston, MA ŽOakey,
1984a,b; Florida and Kenney, 1988; Roberts, 1991; Bygrave and Timmons, 1992., as well as their contribution
to fast growth European regions ŽMeyer-Kramer, 1985; Keeble, 1989..
However, while successful NTBFs potentially offer material advantages to the host economy, their genesis
and early years are potentially fraught with extremely high levels of uncertainty and risk in virtually all areas of

<-----Page 6----->G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

953

activity including financing, technology and marketing ŽHuntsman and Hoban, 1980; Oakey, 1984a,b; Sahlman,
1990; Roberts, 1991; Murray, 1995, 1998.. For the individual NTBF, an exceptional technological offering is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for economic success. Their entrepreneurial founders have also to manage
organisational and productrmarket demands in both internal and external environments characterised by their
complexity and rapid rates of change. Early-stage investment by venture capitalists is often termed ‘capital and
consulting’. Venture capitalists have come to appreciate both the uncertainties and very long odds of picking
future technology winners. They have also had to accept the often very high level of governance related costs of
supporting young companies and their management teams through the early, and often difficult, stages of firm
formation and growth.
1.7. A renaissance for NTBFs?
As contemporary statistics for both UK and pan-European investments indicate, there have been some moves
since 1993 towards a greater proportional involvement in early-stage and technology based investments. In
explaining this change, it is likely that both ‘pull’ and ‘push’ factors are at work. The very marked increase in
the value of technology stocks on the dominant US ‘small caps’ market, NASDAQ, has underscored the
attractions to investors of big technology ‘hits’ such as Netscape Communications, General Magic, Yahoo!, etc.
Netscape, par excellence, which achieved a pre Initial Public Offering valuation of US$928.5 million in 1995,
has illustrated the bizarre new phenomenon of the rapid evolution of billion dollar valuation companies with
corporate histories measured in Ža few. years rather than in decades. 5 The opportunity to invest in the earliest
years of what might be one of the dominating companies of the next millennia is a very attractive prospect
despite the associated uncertainties.
Within the rapidly maturing European markets, lucrative MBOrMBI opportunities may no longer be
available to other than a small number of entrenched venture capital companies ŽMurray, 1995.. Concentration
in the venture capital industry may more usefully be seen in the restriction of attractive deal flow opportunities
to a small and privileged cadre of large venture capital firms rather than a short term decline in the number of
venture capital firms operating in the UK. Venture capitalists with uncommitted and available funds and which
are excluded from many of these later-stage opportunities may well revise their circumspection about investing
in young entrepreneurial businesses. The atomistic structure and information imperfections in the capital
markets for start-up and young companies are such as to reduce the ability of a few providers of capital to
dominate this market in a manner similar to the market for MBOsrMBIs. In addition, Europe has seen a record
growth in the value of new funds raised by venture capital firms. The aggregate level of funds raised by
independent, European venture capital firms has increased nearly five-fold from 1995 ŽECU4.4 billion. to 1997
ŽECU20 billion.. By 1997, a cumulative ECU82.6 billion has been raised in Europe ŽEuropean Venture Capital
Association, 1998.. This creates considerable supply-side pressures on the recipient venture capital firms to
invest finances on a regular base. This need may additionally have helped trigger a reappraisal of classic venture
capital activity.
However, the increase seen in the number of technology investments in the UK is not mirrored in a
commensurate increase in the proportionate value of financings at the earliest stages of investment categories.
Early-stage financings have virtually remained constant at around 5% of total investment in the UK since 1993.
The same is broadly true of Europe. This suggests that the broad definitions of technology investments used in
the annual BVCArEVCA statistics are rather less related to new and more speculative technologies and new
businesses than would at first be assumed.

Netscape reached an Initial Public Offering on NASDAQ in 14 months from incorporation. However, its subsequent share price has
suffered because of analysts’ views of the serious threat of Microsoft to its core products.

2. Factors in the demise of early-stage technology investments
2.1. Venture capital fund performance
The comparative evaluation of the performance of venture capital firms as the agents managing term funds
into which institutional investors have allocated finance is fraught with difficulties. Given the relative youth of
the European industry which did not reach a critical mass of investments until approximately the mid 1980s, the
ability to evaluate the common form of 10 year closed funds has not been available until the last couple of
years. Technical issues of interim capital gains, annual yields, provisions and write-offs and, particularly, tax
treatments have made the constructing of an evaluation process both a theoretical and political mine-field.
However, the adoption by the BVCA and the EVCA of agreed industry valuation guidelines for unquoted
portfolio companies, has significantly assisted in the production of credible performance figures. It is likely that
the rigour of these figures will increase over time. ŽTable 2.
What these fund performance figures have indicated unequivocally is that the historic returns to early-stage
investments have been dramatically poorer than those allocated to later-stage, and less risky, alternatives—particularly MBOrMBI deals. Whatever, the attraction of technology investments to US venture capitalists Žrecord
average returns to US venture capitalists of 41% pa were achieved in 1996, see Red Herring December 1997,
citing Venture Economics., their economically rational European equivalent has been correct to eschew such
investments. And this is exactly how European venture capitalists have behaved until very recently.
2.2. The two tyrannies
The challenge and difficulties of investing in NTBFs may be described with reference to ‘two tyrannies’— Ži.
project risk, and for the majority of small specialist, early-stage, venture capital funds, Žii. the dis-economies of
small size.
2.2.1. Tyranny I: project risk
Professional investors are at their most vulnerable to ‘adverse selection’ problems at the earliest stage of
investment in the life cycle of a new enterprise ŽAmit et al., 1990.. In extremis, an early-stage, technology
investment will require the venture capitalist to come to a formal view on the economic attraction of:
a technology that has not yet been proven; which is to be incorporated into novel products andror services
which still remain solely in the mind of the entrepreneur; and will be eventually offered to markets and
customers whose existence presently remains purely hypothetical. On top of these uncertainties, the new
enterprise may not uncommonly be managed by a technological entrepreneur or a founding team whose
experience of commercial practices and disciplines is negligible, as are their personal assets by which the
venture may be financed or the investment guaranteed . . .

955

It is for these reasons that the venture capitalist has little choice other than to be highly ‘hands on’ or
interventionist in hisrher relationship with the management of the investee firm. As the emergent technology
metamorphoses into potentially attractive new products and services, the venture capitalist will commonly
attempt to build a functionally balanced team of experienced professional managers to augment the creativity
and innovation of the founder team. This transition can be a period of considerable economic and organisational
challenge for both the founding and new managers.
The first tyranny: project risk
Ø Exceptional technical entrepreneurs are rarely competent business persons—they are frequently commercially naive boffins
Ø Project assessment and due diligence is highly problematic in areas concerning ‘leading edge’ technologies
Ø Uncertainty is compounded by the need to analyse both technological feasibility and the existence of a
sufficiently large and attractive market Žoften for a product which does not yet exist.
Ø The speed of the ‘technology trajectory’ often requires an extremely rapid rate of commercial exploitation
before the advent of competitor products andror technological redundancy
Ø Successful NTBFs need to grow, internationalise and develop second generation products in a very short
time horizon. These imperatives places exceptional managerial, financial and technical demands on a new
business
Ø The limited availability of appropriate capital markets increases the uncertainty of the future financing of the
investee firm and the profitable ‘exit’ of the venture capital investor

2.2.2. Tyranny II: scale-related costs of the Õenture capital fund
Given the complexities of the technologies, it is critical that the professional investor is highly informed on
both technical and commercially related issues. Thus, a number of venture capitalists manage risk by becoming
specialist in one or a small number of technology areas rather than by diversification across several
technologies. The information and networking advantages of specialisation are generally seen to be greater than
the forgone benefits of diversification Žfor example, there are several exclusively ‘life sciences’ funds in
existence..
While governance costs in relation to enterprise revenues are extremely high at the early stages of an NTBF’s
genesis and growth, there is little opportunity for the investor to commit large sums of finance to the investee
companies. Yet, a ) 50% annualised IRR to the project is only satisfactory if commensurately large sums of
money can be invested. Attractive returns are only likely to be possible after productrservice prototypes have
been proven and a major marketing and sales Žor licensing. drive launched. This may be some several years
after initial R & D activity. Given the time cost of money, extended research and development cycles demand a
commensurately high project return. These first marketing exercises may well be international in scope ŽOviatt
and McDougall, 1994; Burgel and Murray, 1998. thereby adding a further source of uncertainty.
The second tyranny: dis-economies of small fund size
Ø The high costs of information in complex and imperfect markets
Ø The high levels of management support and guidance required by early-stage investees
Ø The limited ability to attenuate project risks by diversifying the VC fund
Ø The limited ability to invest large sums early in the life cycle of the investee firm
Ø The skewed riskrreturn profile resulting in the need for a big success by the VC
Ø The long NTBF cycle and its implications on fund structurerconductrperformance
Ø The demand for ‘quantum leaps’ in follow-on financing in a successful NTBF and the consequent danger of
excessive dilution of ownership for the financially constrained original investors Žand the entrepreneur.
Ø Historically, the wholesale unattractiveness to institutional investors of early-stage, technology specialist,
venture capital funds—other than in the US

<-----Page 9----->G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

956

2.3. NTBFs as a ‘special case’
While it has taken some time for the technical argument that market imperfections in the allocation of capital
to NTBFs do exist and are material Žparticularly information asymmetries and existence of socially valuable
externalities., there appears now to be a more widespread and sympathetic acceptance of this position ŽStorey
and Tether, 1996.. This is not to argue that a firm, merely because it may be categorised as being an NTBF,
should automatically be financed. Venture capital firms are uniform in their assertion that the majority of
businesses they see are not viable investment opportunities given the exceptional fund returns demanded by
their institutional investors. But these high returns are a consequence of the risks and uncertainties incurred by
the venture capital firm which will expect to see the majority of its portfolio under-perform against the original
performance targets sold to the institutional investors in its fund. Therefore, individual firm applicants for
venture capital finance incur a pricing penalty for reasons intrinsic to this investment activity and outside their
individual control.
As noted, several European institutions have cited the limited provision of finance as a major potential
impediment to the adequate supply of NTBFs within the European Union. From the perspective of the NTBFs,
the substance does not yet appear to reflect fully the apparently increased level of contemporary government
interest and concern. While the majority of European Union member states have a range of financial instruments
to support SMEs, Storey and Tether only found eight countries with direct financing support schemes which
included NTBFs. This number of countries dropped to four ŽGermany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. if
only explicit and exclusively focused NTBF schemes were considered. Implicit in their observations is the fact
that fast growth NTBFs are different from other types of SME. Effective policy instruments need to reflect and
address the peculiar strengths and, particularly, the weaknesses of NTBFs in Europe. This present paper will
only allude to indirect support instruments given their relevance to venture capital fund performance.

3. Policy instruments to alleviate economic constraints on investment—three generic (indirect) instruments
Policies to incentivise the supply of venture capital from established capital markets Žprimarily via
institutional investors., and which specifically focus on the venture capital firm, commonly rely on three
‘indirect’ instruments ŽFig. 3..
3.1. Down-side protection 6
Early-stage investments in NTBFs carry a range of firm and industry specific risks. Thus, it is not uncommon
for a very significant proportion of the investee firms in a portfolio to result in full or partial loss of the venture
capitalist’s investment. This adverse outcome skews the riskrreward distribution strongly towards poor fund
returns. Recognising this peculiar reality, a number of governments have either instituted publicly supported,
insurance schemes ŽSOFARIS in France. or measures for the state to share in the cost of investment and, thus,
of potential failure Žthe terminated PPM scheme in the Netherlands, and the current BTU scheme in Germany..
Down-side protection is extremely important for smaller funds in particular. Being already constrained by
limited finances, the write-off of a significant proportion of total investment can reduce the level of residual
operating funds to below a viable limit. However, the very nature of early-stage investment requires that

6

In addition to the described schemes, there is also a 50% guarantee scheme, the Udviklingsselskaber, in Denmark.

significant risks are taken and a high level of uncertainty is accepted. A fund that is not losing a proportion of
investments is probably acting in too conservative a manner in emerging technology markets.
It is common for these guarantee schemes to assume a substantial proportion of the costs of project failure.
SOFARIS provides a 50% cover as did the PPM scheme Žwhich ended in 1995.. The BTU scheme assumes a
maximum cover of 75% of total project investment cost Žalthough calculated in different ways for the two
variants of the scheme.. Both the BTU and the PPM schemes extended this guarantee for 5 years from the time
of the first venture capital investment in a portfolio company. After 5 years, cover under the PPM scheme
declined by 10% a year to disappear at year 10. The critically vulnerable first year of the investment was also
removed from the cover in the post 1988 variant of the Dutch scheme. All schemes instituted a ceiling level of
cover per portfolio firm.
3.2. Upside leÕerage
Underwriting project losses puts a floor or safety net under the fund. However, this measure can produce the
unfortunate consequence of reducing the venture capitalists’ incentive to ensure that they make good investments because ‘adverse selection’ mistakes become significantly less costly. Upside leverage instruments,
conversely, do not protect the venture capital firm against the costs of project failure but multiply the financial
benefits of success to the disproportionate advantage of the venture capital firms and their private equity
investors Žlimited partners.. Given that a relatively small number of investments will typically provide the
majority of capital gain for the fund, this leverage again can be critically important for the smaller fund.
Leverage schemes usually allow each dollar of a venture capitalist’s fund to be matched with one or more
dollars of the government’s money. The BTU scheme Žco-financing variant. will match the venture capitalist in
each inÕestment on a parity, i.e., 1:1, ratio to a ceiling of DM3 million federal investment. In the SBIC Scheme,
the leverage is 2:1 for most licensed US venture capitalists outside special development areas, up to a ceiling of
a government contribution of US$90 million per fund. Thus, a US$45 million fund of private investors can
attract the maximum leverage of US$90 million publicly guaranteed monies to become a US$135 million US
fund. In 1997, the Australian government formally adopted a local equivalent of the revised SBIC Scheme by

<-----Page 11----->958

G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

creating the Innovation Investment Fund with A$130 million available for leveraged investment on a 2:1
State:Private ratio.
In addition, these schemes materially assist the fund in being able to provide portfolio companies with
successive rounds of finance. This dearth of follow-on finance is a major problem for a small venture fund
supporting an exciting, and invariably cash demanding, investee company ŽMurray, 1994.. Given that the
government finances are in effect loans, the venture capitalists pay an annual interest charge. However, this
source of capital is less costly than that provided by private equity co-investors in the event that the fund is
profitable. 7 The State may insist on a share of the capital gain of the fund. While increasing the cost of the
State’s participation, the benefits of leverage outweigh the incremental costs—provided that attractive investments are made and realised by the fund. Thus, the loan allows the fund to ‘gear up or leverage’ both the scale
and the returns from the investment to the benefit of the private equity investors. Zero Stage Capital, a Boston
based, early-stage venture capital firm, and one of the first managing partners to be awarded a licence by the
Small Business Administration under the new leverage scheme, has estimated that the benefit of this instrument
can translate into a one third improvement on the terminal IRR of an average performing fund.
3.3. Support for the fund’s operating costs
Specialist early-stage, technology funds have historically been characterised by their small size. The great
majority of these funds in Europe had been capitalised at under ECU20 million. Several EU sponsored seed
funds had resources of as little as ECU2 million ŽMurray, 1998.. As such, they are able to exploit few of the
scale and scope economies available to larger development capital funds of US$200 million upwards. However,
industry norms for the level of fee income available to the managing partners Ži.e., the venture capital firm. are
based on the precedents set by these larger and more influential funds. In addition, in most venture capital
communities, the managing partners have seen significant downwards pressure on the percentage of fee incomes
negotiable and an increase in the stringency of the conditions under which these fees are provided. These
pressures are in no small part a consequence of early abuses of inexperienced institutional investors by
aggressive venture capital firms. 8
The ‘going rate’ management fee for development or merchant capital funds is around 2–2 1r2% of the total
value of the funds raised. Several institutions have negotiated ‘tapering’ fee incomes over the life of the fund
Žthe described model also employs a taper from the sixth year.. The appropriate figure for specialist, early-stage
technology funds in order to cover the operating costs of the venture capital management activity is probably
about 4–5% of finance raised ŽHook, 1992. depending on the scale of the funds managed Žsee below.. This
latter figure has appeared totally unacceptable to the vast majority of institutional investors or their advisers. Of
particular distaste to potential investors is that fees of this order could result in a very substantial proportion of
the total of a small fund being ‘swallowed up’ in payments to management rather than being allocated to the
targeted portfolio firms.
The European Seed Capital Fund pilot programme of the European Union Ž1988–1995. was a pan-European
attempt to address this issue of the relatively Žhigh. cost of managerial governance in small funds. Half of the
eligible operating costs of the 23 early-stage funds in the programme were paid for by the European
Commission through the provision of a non-interest bearing, term loan to the fund. This subsidy on operating
costs was paid for start-up costs and the first 5 year’s running costs of the fund. The loan to cover a part of the
costs was only repayable if the fund subsequently made a profit on its investments over the 10 years of the
fund’s life.

7

In practice, the number of sources of equity co-investment available for early-stage enterprises can be severely constrained.
These circumstances led one industry commentator memorably to observe that the UK venture capital industry had ‘mugged’
institutional investors ŽInitiative Europe, 1994..
8

<-----Page 12----->G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

959

The initial review of the European Seed Capital Fund Scheme carried out by the author in 1991 for the
European Commission placed considerable emphasis on the economic vulnerability of small, grant-dependent
funds ŽMurray, 1998.. The average size of the 21 funds surveyed was ECU1.7 million Žrange ECU0.5–7
million.. The observation was made that both regional and commercial funds would run out of finances within
their 10 year horizons even before making any investment in portfolio companies. Fundamentally, the
administrative costs of the funds was strongly out of kilter with the total level of finances available.
A further study ŽMurray, 1994. of technology specialist, start-up and early-stage venture capital funds in the
UK in 1992 Ži.e., funds which did not undertake MBOrMBI, replacement equity or rescue finance. indicated
that the UK population of independent management companies controlling closed end funds was only nine
businesses. 9 If the four largest funds which ranged from £5–21 million are removed, the average size of the
five remaining funds is £1.41 million Žrange £0.5–1.6 million.. A review of the BVCA Directory 1996r7
ŽBritish Venture Capital Association, 1996. some 4 years later again only identified nine specialist early-stage
funds. Removing one very large international fund of £285 million, gave eight funds with an average size of
£8.2 million Žrange £1–19 million.. While the average size of these technology specialist funds has grown
nearly six-fold in 4 years, there remains a continuing question of fund viability give the absolute small size of
the funds.

4. The model
4.1. Research objectiÕes and organisation
In order to explore in more detail the determinants which influences the scale and viability of an early-stage,
specialist technology fund, it was decided to construct a spreadsheet model in Microsoft Excel which could
closely mirror the financial characteristics of a ‘typical fund’ and the likely range of economic outcomes of the
investment activity. It was hoped to produce a model in which the major parameters of costs and revenues could
be isolated, defined and manipulated to ascertain their subsequent impact on fund performance. The model
architecture was designed to allow both practitioners and other academics to augment or customise the data to
their own needs. Given the multi-stage investment behaviour of an early-stage technology fund, it was decided
to use a Decision Tree Analysis given the difficulties of simple discounted cash flow valuation models ŽLerner,
1994..
Additionally, it was also hoped to use the model to explore the impact of the two major types of state support
for early-stage funds, i.e., guarantee and leverage assistance on a ‘typical’ fund. Accordingly, two state
supported variants of the model were also constructed.
4.1.1. Sources of fund information
The original determination of the cost and revenue items was modelled on the experience of the Australian
Technology Group. This specialist venture capital fund was set up with £15 ŽA$30. million of Australian federal
government support in 1995. Despite government financial involvement as the sole investor, ATG was
conceived as, and was expected to develop into, a fully commercial investment activity. The authors were given
full access to fund costs and portfolio firm investment details to assist in defining the original model. However,

9
These figures only related to specialist, early-stage venture capital firms registered as full members of the BVCA. In reality, there exist
a number of other such investors which are not members of the BVCA. However, these activities which are often publicly supported
initiatives are significantly smaller, in terms of funds under management, than full BVCA members.

characteristics of the fund which were peculiar and exclusive to ATG or to the Australian environment were
excluded in order to retain the generic character of the model. Costs structures were subsequently referenced to
a second independent, fixed term, early-stage Australian fund which was set up in 1996 without state support
and operated with a more parsimonious cost structure.
Both of the Australian funds were too early in their investment and realisation cycles to be able to provide
useful statistics on portfolio firms’ successes and failures. In consequence, a senior investment executive from
each of four established Ži.e., more than one investmentrrealisation fund cycle concluded. UK specialist
early-stage, technology funds was contacted. These four funds invested across a range of technologies included
biotechnology. They were asked for their views as to the distribution of investment outcomes which could
typically be expected from early-stage technology deals. They were also invited to agree with or make
amendments to a table of probabilities of capital gainsrlosses over three rounds of finance Žsee Table 3.. The
purpose of this request was not to get an exact match with the respondents’ funds and information of this detail
was not sought. Rather, the views of these correspondents on the credibility of such early-stage portfolio
outcomes and probabilities was requested. Overall, there was surprisingly strong agreement as to the reasonableness of the posited assumptions. Observations were restricted to minor variations in estimates of probabilities or
capital multiples. All respondents confirmed the plausibility of the three stage, 6 year project investment cycle
for a 10 year closed fund Žsee below..
The respondent funds were also asked to confirm the credibility of four structural characteristics of a
‘typical’ early-stage fund ŽTable 4..
Of the four questions, again strong agreement was provided on the assumptions made with one exception.
Accordingly, it was decided to increase to 10% the maximum percentage of the fund allocated to any one
investment in the model.

5. Structure of the model
5.1. The model’s specification and assumptions
Based on an examination of the academic and practitioner literature of venture capital and subsequent
investigation of the actual performance and operation of several specialist, fixed term independent funds, a
model specification was derived. 10
5.1.1. Fund structure
The fund is structured as a 10 year, fixed life fund with the investment capital contributed progressively over
the first 8 years.
Capital from poor investments Ždefined as a zero or negative Net Present Value ŽNPV. when the 2 year
investment outcome is discounted back to year zero using a nominal cost of capital and employing the
appropriate beta rating. is ‘returned’ as the investments are liquidated. 11 The capital still invested at the end of
the 10 year horizon is returned at that date by the salerfloatation of the remaining investments. Thus, it is
assumed that all investments are liquidated by the end of the 10 year period. In practice, this is a rather strong,
and heroic, assumption.
5.1.2. InÕestment and exit timing
In order to model the sequential investment behaviour of the fund, the total capital is divided into five
‘mini-funds’, each running for 6 years and sequentially offset by 1 year. That is, the first mini-fund runs from
year 0 to year 6, the second from year 1 to year 7, etc. The fifth and final mini-fund runs from year 5 to 10
inclusive. This timing reflects the staged investment activity of a typical fund including the time constraints on
investment executives in assessing and effecting new investments in the earlier stages of a fund. As a fund
comes towards its concluding year, the activities of the investment executives are increasingly directed to
ensuring that portfolio companies successfully exit the fund.
Each mini-fund consists of three investment rounds, spaced at 2 yearly intervals. The first round takes place
in the start or zero year for the mini-fund, the second round occurs at the end of the second year of the
mini-fund, and the third round occurs at the end of the fourth year of the mini-fund. The amounts drawn down
in each round is user defined in the model. This investment arrangement allows for a total of 15 Ž3 rounds of
finance= 5 mini-funds. capital draw downs during the life of the fund, the timings of which are assumed to be
known at the outset but could be varied by the model user.
5.1.3. InÕestment outcomes and probabilities
The mini-fund is taken to be the unit of investment activity, and the combination of all 5 ‘mini-funds’
constitutes a portfolio of investments Ži.e., the total fund.. To model the probabilities and capital gain outcomes
relating to successful and unsuccessful investments, a table of ‘probability vs. capital multiple’ was established
for each round within a mini-fund. Thus, three separate tables each corresponding to successive investment
rounds within the mini-fund were created. For each table there are four possible outcomes, or states, over the 2

10
The term ‘independent’ is used to denote a fund structure whereby professional managers, acting as agents, seek the commitment of
institutional investors as limited partners in a fund. The subscribed fund operates for a fixed period, normally 10 years, over which time
investments are made and then realised. The limited partners are returned any capital gains net of the costs of the fund managers and less
any distribution of capital gain awarded to the manager Žthe ‘carried interest’..
11
In practice, the model did not return any residual from ‘failed’ investments until the end of the 10 year fund period. However, residual
monies so held were not available for further investment and earned a market cost of capital, i.e., the opportunity cost to the investors, while
still held in the fund.

<-----Page 15----->G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

962

year period immediately following the draw down of the round of finance. Each outcome has an associated
probability of occurrence Žthe total of which is 1.0., and a ‘capital multiplier’ which was defined as:
s

Ž Value of investment at t q 2 yrs. less Ž Value of investment at ‘draw down’, i.e. t q 0 yrs.
Ž Value of investment at t q 0 yrs.

Those occasions where the principal sum or less is returned from the discounted investment cash flows, are
designated as ‘failures’. Any residual capital left after the expiry of the 2 year investment period is returned to
the limited partners with interest, at the end of the 10 year period. These residual sums are not available for
further investment and are subtracted from the total funds available. In the case of the 50% and the 100%
guarantee variants of the model, a part or the whole of the losses incurred in failed investments are returned to
the limited partners, with interest, at the end of the 10 year period.
The alternative outcomes where the discounted investment returns exceed the original capital are designated
as ‘successes’. The total capital generated or ‘pay out’ Žprincipalq gain. is then applied to the next round of
investment activity. This process is repeated until the three rounds of finance for each mini-fund are concluded
over the 6 year investment period.
For example, if £1 million is invested in an investment round, and the appropriate table is as below, then the
four possible payoffs will be:
£0
£1M
£2M
£4M

with 40% probability
with 30% probability
with 20% probability
with 10% probability

The probability of ‘failure’ is 70% Ž40% q 30%. and will result in an expected return of capital to investors
of £300,000 Ž£0 = 0.4 q £1M = 0.3.. The probability of ‘success’ is 30% Ž20% q 10%. which will place an
expected value on the investment of £800,000 Ž£2M = 0.2 q £4M = 0.1.. The expected outcome is discounted
Žincluding the beta value. back to the time of the investment in order to produce an NPV. Only aggregated
outcomes with a positive NPV continue to the next decision point up until the third and final round of finance.
The model conducts an analysis on the basis of the ‘expected’ outcome. This is the average of the 64 possible
outcomes with the weighting applied to each outcome being the probability of this outcome occurring.
The probabilityrpay out table for each round of finance is allowed to be different. It is assumed that, as the
investors become increasingly familiar with the prospects of their portfolio companies, the risk of investment
failure decreases progressively in Rounds 2 and 3. This is reflected in the deployment of declining investment
betas for each successive round Ži.e., 2.0, 1.6, and 1.4. when calculating the cost of capital to the investors.

963

5.1.4. Management fees leÕied on the fund
The fee structure consists of two parts. For the first 5 years of the fund, the fee is a fixed annual percentage
of the total capital committed to the fund. The management fee charges incurred by the fund are irrespective of
whether or not finance is actually drawn down from the fund and invested in portfolio companies. For the
remaining life of the fund from year 6, the management fee levied is a fixed annual percentage of the total
capital committed less any capital nominated for return from the fund to the investors. Thus, the managers
receive a tapering fee income from year 6 as the fund becomes fully invested and investee companies
increasingly exit from the portfolio.
The fees for the whole investment period must be paid from the initial capital raised by the fund. Therefore,
the actual or net amount of capital available for investment is reduced by the cumulative fee costs.
5.1.5. ‘Carried interest’ receiÕed by the managing partners
In common with normal operating practice in independent funds, the managing partners are acting as agents
on behalf of the limited or private partners Žinstitutional investors.. Management is incentivised to perform in a
manner consistent with the interests of the fund’s investors. Accordingly, the management fee is designed to
cover the legitimate operating costs of the management team but not to reward them for making investments per
se. It is the incentive structure which is designed to reward management for making good investments. Thus,
managers are allowed to retain 20% of the capital gain of the total fund after the limited partners’ fee levies
have been repaid and the performance of the fund has exceeded a ‘hurdle’ of the cost of capital to the fund. This
hurdle represents the ‘opportunity cost’ of access to their capital forgone by the investors or a time value of their
money invested.
5.1.6. Fund performance criteria: IRR and NPV
The model computes an annualised IRR% for both the mini-fund and for the total fund based on capital
invested and returned net of fees. However, IRRs can be misleading. Particularly in circumstances where both
negative and positive cashflows are recorded over successive periods, multiple IRRs can be generated.
Therefore, the model also computes the NPV for each of the mini-funds and for the combined portfolio. NPV
represents the additional wealth created for the investors, over the life of the fund.
In addition to computing the limited partners’ IRR and NPV for the mini-funds and then the aggregated fund,
the model also recognised the disparate financial interests of the venture capitalist managing partner acting as
agent on behalf of the institutional investors or limited partners. Thus the Managers’ IRR is also calculated.
These returns are based on the fee income generated and the managers’ opportunity for a minority participation
in the ‘carried interest’ or net capital gain of the fund.
Irrespective of the merits of NPV calculations, the venture capital industry almost exclusively measures fund
performance in terms of net IRRs, i.e., total cash invested and total cash received after all costs. Accordingly,
both measurements are employed in presenting the results of the model Žsee Section H..
The section on investment, outlined above, provides the basis for estimating the cashflows expected in the
‘mini-funds’ and total fund. The determination of an appropriate discount rate is accomplished with reference to
the weighted average cost of capital ŽWACC. and Capital Asset Pricing Model ŽCAPM..
The CAPM is commonly used to estimate a cost of equity from the following formula:
re s rf q Ž rm y rf . = beta
where: re —cost of equity; rf —risk free interest rate; rm —rate of return on the market for all assets; beta—a
measure of relative risk.
The model allows the input of these variables in order to compute the cost of equity. Given the cost of debt,
and the ratio of debt to equity in the funding of the capital for the total fund, the weighted average cost of
capital can be computed and applied to the expected cashflows. Only a pre-tax analysis is included in the model.
Similarly, it is assumed for the purposes of the present model that the funds invested are exclusively via equity

instruments. Thus, gearing applied by either the venture capitalist or the portfolio companies is not included in
the model. This is considered a valid simplification. The use of debt for gearing purposes is likely to be highly
inappropriate in young and research-intensive enterprises which commonly experience extended periods when
the cash flows are exclusively negative.

7. Variants on the base case model—impact of state support schemes
In order to look at the implications of state support for early-stage funds, the following two variants of the
models were created.
7.1. Generic support scheme 1— state ‘ guarantee and underwriting’ of indiÕidual project failure
Ø The venture capital firm receives in part or full Ž50% or 100% specified in the model. the original equity
participation in the project on termination of an unsuccessful project within the five mini-funds. The guarantee
is eventually returned to the limited partners and is not reinvested by the fund managers.
Ø The venture capital firm pays an up-front charge for the guarantee which is calculated as a percentage of
the total finance raised by the fund. ŽThis percentage is modelled as a variable. The guarantee cost is taken off
the total sum available for investment..
Ø On realisation of successful portfolio investments, the guarantor receives a proportion of the value-added
generated. Unlike the contribution of ‘carried interest’ going to the managers, the value-added in which the
guarantor participates contains no ‘hurdle’ prior to distribution. This share of capital gain is no longer available
to the investors. ŽThe proportion is modelled as a variable and can be set at zero percent..

7.2. Generic support scheme 2— state ‘leÕerage’ of the priÕate equity of the fund
Ø Matching equity is provided by the State and is drawn down at the time of an investment.
Ø The ratio of State to private equity is a variable. The default is: 1:1. Žn.b. A ratio of 2:1 is used in the
results discussed in Section H.
Ø State equity receives a preferred, annual coupon approximating to the 10 year bank rate—say 8.00%. This
annual charge is paid by the fund. The model allows this annual charge to be set as a variable percentage
including a value of zero.
Ø The venture capital firm can charge an annual management fee on the State’s equity at the time of
drawdown. This is set as a variable with the normal venture capital firm’s management fee as the default but
with the option to have a zero management fee levied on State finance.
Ø The State participates in any value-added as a percentage of total capital gain to the fund. This is set as a
variable with default at 20% but with the option for a zero allocation.
Ø In the event of project failure, all investors share pro-rata, based on their contribution of total equity, in the
net loss.
8. Interrogation of the model(s)
The objective in constructing the model was to seek to understand, on the cost and investment return
assumptions stated, a number of the key dynamics of early-stage venture capital funds. Of particular interest
were the following relationships:
Ži. total fund size to investment returnsrperformance;
Žii. key cost and investment drivers on investment returnsrperformance;
Žiii. impact of support schemes on investment returnsrperformance.
The investment performance must necessarily be seen from two perspectives, i.e., the investment returns
reaped by the institutional investors Žlimited partners in the fund. or the venture capital firm Žmanaging partners
to the fund.. The terms—Private Partners’ IRR and Managers’ IRR—are used to differentiate these two
performance metrics, respectively. It should be noted that the burden of scale diseconomies fall most directly on
the management agents in that they cannot levy additional charges on their institutional investors to meet a cost
over-run. However, in practice, a very poor return to the managers is likely to impact directly on the
institutional investors. Managers would seek to reduce and claw back some of the losses incurred andror reduce
their commitment to the fund investors and portfolio companies under management. A desirable investment
performance target for an early stage technology fund is pragmatically rather than theoretically set at an IRR of
circa 25% p.a.
It was hoped to use any enhanced understanding of this particularly challenging stage of investment activity
to inform the activities of both industry practitioners and State collaborators. The specific and additional needs
of these two interest groups can be built into further refinements of the model. Žn.b. In the following tables the
base case figures are applied to a fund of £20 million and with a management fee of 2.5% unless either of these
two variables are the subject of the simulation. See Table 6 for a full specification of the base case..
8.1. The effect of fund size
The Management’s IRRs only start to become positive at a fund size of just under £10 million, and the rate
of growth of the Management’s IRR starts to decline rapidly beyond £20 million. The Management’s IRR
elasticity is 0.36% per million of additional funding. The base case suggests that a fund is not likely to be
economically attractive to either institutional investors Žlimited partners. or the managing partners Žventure
capital firm. on probable cost and revenue assumptions below a scale of £15 million. In practice, for the
managing partner to receive an IRR of 30%, requires a minimum fund size of £20 million. ŽFig. 4.

967

Fig. 4. Effect of fund size on management’s and private partners’ returns on ‘base case’ model.

The IRR return to the limited partners is insensitive to an increase in the size of the fund. Scale effects are
not captured in IRR calculations if no other variables are changed. However, if the return to the limited partners
is measured by NPV, the scale effects are immediately evident. The NPV increases in direct proportion to the
increase in size of the fund. For example, in the base case model, the NPV to a £10 million fund is computed as
£1.4 million. Doubling the fund size to £20 million results in a doubling of the NPV to £2.8 million. There is a
straight line relationship between fund size and the limited partners’ NPV.
8.2. The effect of management fee income
This effect can also be illustrated when the management fee rate is changed. An increase of management fee
of half one percent serves to reduce the NPV of the limited partners by £200,000 This can be expressed as a
reduction in the limited partners’ NPV of 6.6% per 1% fee increase to the managing partner. Again, the IRR
calculation does not pick up this effect on the limited partners’ returns.
The benefit of this transfer of resources to the management partner via an increase in fee income is captured
both in a near doubling of its IRR between 2.5% and 5% and in an increase in the NPV. A 1% increase in the
management’s fee results in an incremental gain of £945,000 to the management. Management, in NPV terms,
are nearly five times more sensitive to a fee rate change than the limited partners. ŽFig. 5.
This would suggest that limited partners have some discretion regarding the appropriate level of management’s fee income on early-stage funds when a documented case is presented regarding the additional costs
incurred. In purely nominal terms, the gain to management significantly outweighs the consequent loss to the
Limited investors of such a change. However, the venture capital agent’s fees are levied to cover the costs of
managing the fund on behalf of the institutional investors. These fees are not paid to provide a source of
additional profit after operational costs are fully met.
8.3. Effect of increasing fund costs (Fig. 6)
The raising of the total fund operating costs clearly impacts significantly on the returns to the management.
Management alone bear the adverse outcomes of any cost over-runs as the responsibility of limited partners is

<-----Page 21----->968

Fig. 5. Effect of fee income on fund performance.

limited to the cost of the management fee incurred. The limited partners’ IRR and NPV is insensitive to an
increase in costs for which management are alone responsible. On the existing cost and income structures, the
raising of total costs by 50% rapidly destroys the economics of a £20 million fund to the venture capital agent.
In the event of the fund’s total costs doubling, the Management’s IRR is reduced from a satisfactory 29% to a
catastrophic 0.28% pa. The model again corroborates the critical need of early stage funds to ensure that costs
are balanced against revenues and positive cashflow.
8.4. Effect of management’s carried interest (Fig. 7)
Again, the negative impact of an increase in the amount of carried interest paid as a performance incentive on
the returns of limited partners is much less than the consequent gain to the management. When measured by
IRR, the difference is 14-fold with IRR elasticities to the limited partners and the management of y0.34% and

q3.4%, respectively, per percentage change in the carried interest. In NPV terms, every 1% increase in the
carried interest negotiated by management costs the limited partners a reduction in NPV of £54,000.
This suggests that, if the fund’s performance is measured in terms of IRRs, ‘the carry’ is a highly cost
effective means of incentivising the management to undertaken profitable investments within the fund, as
measured by the incremental benefits gained and forgone to the two parties. Given that each percentage increase
in the carried interest from the industry standard of 20% reduces the limited partners NPV by approximately
2%, such a change may be less attractive.
8.5. Effect of a star inÕestment on fund performance
In this simulation the investment outcomes were altered to produce a more binary outcome of success or
failure. ŽFig. 8.

Capital multiple returns by investment stage were either zero or negative on 50% of occasions. Conversely,
there was a one in two hundred chance of a 100 = capital gain over three rounds of finance. ŽTable 9.
While a 100 = capital gain appears attractive, the low probability ascribed for its achievement reduces the
impact of such an occurrence. However, there still remains a positive impact despite the long odds. At a fund
size of £20 million, the management gain approximately 14 percentage points with the IRR increasing to 43.6%.
The increase in returns to the limited partners is a more modest 5.7% to produce a revised IRR of 25.26%.
However, if the limited partners’ returns are assessed in terms of NPV, the star investment produces material
benefits. The limited partners’ NPV on a £20 million fund increases from £2.8 million to £8.5 million. A £10
million increase in fund size results in a marginal improvement of NPV in the star investment of £4.2 million.
This gain is three-fold larger than when compared to the marginal improvement of £1.4 million in the base case
investment.
While a 100 = capital gain is improbable, it still does exist. This extreme outcome is in addition to the two
additional opportunities to achieve a 10 = capital gain at the end of rounds two and three. It would appear that
the benefits of a ‘star’ investments are material to limited partners and managers alike. Such a desired outcome
should Žand does. remain a sensible goal of the investment managers.
8.6. Effect of proÕiding a guarantee to the fund managers (Table 10)
Unlike the base case model, the guarantee scheme requires that the fund pays both a fee for the provision of
the guarantee and gives a share of any ensuing capital gain to the guarantor. Thus, the guarantor participates in
the success of the fund in part recompense for the inevitable losses of the fund and the subsequent underwriting
costs incurred by the guarantor.

8.7. Effect of fund size on a guaranteed fund
The effect of the 100% guarantee is to increase significantly the impact of the fund size on the returns to
management. This is to be expected as a full 100% guarantee on speculative investments essentially means that
these risky decisions are costless. While the IRR to the limited partners is little changed at 20.7% from the base
case of 19.5%, the NPV of the portfolio increases by 31% at each level of fund size compared to the base case.
ŽFig. 9.
However, when a 50% guarantee scheme is put in place, the results are more ambivalent. At a fund size of
£20 million, the IRR to the limited partners increases marginally from 19.52% to 20.65% but the resultant NPV
is only 70% of that achieved by the base case. The NPV of the base case is £2.82 million and the 50% guarantee
scheme is £1.96 million. This is likely to be due to the consequent charges incurred from the guarantor both in
the percentage fee levied and the guarantor’s share of the eventual capital gain Žif any. of the fund. At a full
underwriting of failed investments, these charges remain acceptable. At a 50 percentage guarantee, investors
would be materially better off Žin NPV terms. if they forwent the guarantee.

8.8. Effect of 2:1 leÕerage on fund performance
The model was adapted to reflect the key elements of the revised Small Business Investment Company
ŽSBIC. Scheme, post 1992, whereby US federal government funds are used to leverage the ‘upside’ returns of
the management and the limited partners Žinstitutional investors.. The model allows a range of government
contributions to total equity to be computed.
The following charts are based on a 2:1 government:private investment ratio. Government funds are charged
at a long term bond rate of 7% although this variable can be changed in the model. As with the guarantee
option, the State is paid an interest coupon on the leveraged funds provided. The State contributor participates in

Fig. 10. Effect of 2:1 state:private leverage on fund performance.

973

Fig. 11. Effect of scale of government leverage on the performance of a £20 million fund.

any capital gain of the fund. However, the State in turn pays the prevailing fee to the managing partner for the
management of the State’s contribution to the whole fund. The model is based on a £20 million fund size. All
other parameters, e.g., 20% management carry, etc., remain unchanged as in earlier model specifications. ŽTable
11; Fig. 10.
While the size of fund needed for a positive Management’s IRR is slightly higher than for the base case, the
major effect of leverage is in the marked increase in IRR returns to the private investors. Their annualised
returns increases from 18% to 28% at each level of fund size—a material increase of 55%. The elasticity of
Management’s IRR to fund size is 1.3% per £ million increase. However, if the leverage effect is measured in
NPV terms, the effect of the 2:1 leverage is to increase the NPV to the limited partners by a rather more modest
6.9%, or £0.2 million, across the range of fund sizes. ŽFig. 11.

Fig. 12. Effect of interest cost of state’s leveraged funds on the performance of a £20 million fund.

<-----Page 27----->974

G.C. Murray, R. Marriottr Research Policy 27 (1998) 947–976

Increasing the leverage of the fund increases the IRR to the private partners but slightly decreases the
Management’s IRR. The IRR elasticities per percentage increase in State leverage are 0.26% to the limited
partners and y0.063% to the management. If appraised in NPV terms, the move from a zero contribution of
funds from the State to a 90% contribution changes the limited partners’ NPV from £1.75 million to £1.32
million. This is a 52% change or an elasticity of £10,000 per percentage increase of State leverage. ŽFig. 12.
The effect of increasing the payment to the State via the annual interest charge on the supplied leveraging
finance is to lower the IRRs to the limited partners. The elasticities for a 1% increase in the cost of State capital
is y1.32% and y0.84% for the limited partners’ and the management’s IRRs, respectively. None the less, the
IRR returns to both parties still remain relatively attractive. However, assessing performance in IRR terms
disguises the NPV impact of increasing interest charges levied by the State. If the State interest rate is changed
from 1% to 10%, there is a 82.5% reduction in the value of the limited partner’s NPV which decreases from
£4.77 to £0.84 million. The positive leverage effects of the State’s contribution is larger than the negative effect
Žon investors’ returns. of increasing the cost of State capital. Thus, the State may charge a commercial Ži.e., risk
adjusted. or at least bond rate level of interest payment without prejudicing the commercial returns of the
private investors or their venture capital agents.
9. Concluding observations
The nature of the above simulations is such that categorical conclusions are dangerous without clearly
specifying all the model parameters of importance. In addition, a level of prudence is necessary given that
financial models invariably remain a crude analogue of reality. The model should not be used in a primarily
prescriptive fashion. Rather, its value is as a means of systematically exploring the relationships between costs
and revenues for an early-stage fund under various operating assumptions and policy alternatives. The models
also illustrates the dangers for all investors of reliance on a single performance metric, especially IRR%.
However, making the fundamental assumption that a flow of attractive investments is available to the fund
managers, the most categorical findings concern the importance of fund size on the returns to both the private
investors Žthe limited partners. and, particularly, the venture capital management company Žthe managing
partner.. It is stressed that the return goals of both parties have to be met to ensure long term viability of such
fixed term, fund based, technology investments. The venture capitalist cannot be expected to bear an
unreasonable burden of risk from the fixed and variable costs incurred without adequate recompense.
On the cost and performance data supplied, it is suggested that the desired minimum size of a specialist,
technology focused, early-stage venture capital fund should be approximately £20 million Žequivalent to US$33
million or ECU28 million.. A fund with less than £15 million ŽUS$25 million or ECU21 million. under
management is of increasing vulnerability regarding its ability to return to both private and managing partners
investment rewards commensurate with the levels of risk and illiquidity incurred. Meeting commercial returns
remain difficult for funds of this small size even with the imposition of 2:1 leveraged government funding.
The level of annual fee income which the managing agent can earn also remains of considerable importance.
For every 1% increase in management fee, the IRR of the venture capitalist managing a £20 million fund
increases by 3.74% from 17% Žat a 1% fee. to 33% Žat a 5% fee. without changing any other parameters. In this
context, a fee income for the managing agents in a small, technology specialist, early-stage fund above the
development capital funds’ standard of 2–2 1r2% appears equitable to both management and the investors.
Both guarantee and leverage support scheme do improve the returns to investors. The 100% guarantee
materially reduced the threshold Žby about £5 million. at which a fund becomes viable. However, a 50%
guarantee scheme, given its associated costs, has little benefit providing only a marginal gain to IRRs and
reduces the NPV returns to limited partners. In contrast, 2:1 StaterPrivate leverage improves the returns of
limited partners by over 50% while increasing slightly the fund size needed for the managing partner to achieve
a given IRR. The leverage scheme remains effective at improving limited partners’ returns even at an economic
interest charge on the State’s contribution or underwriting of debt finances.

It is important to note that this study has only dealt with commercial funds, i.e., those funds which seek to
attract investors in international capital markets. On a number of occasions local and national governments will
further impose parochial development remits on ‘captive’ venture capital organisations in which they are
commonly the sole or largest institutional investor. Given that these organisations may well be obliged by their
investors to pursue goals which are in conflict with commercially optimal behaviour, this research can make no
substantive comment on the structural requirements of such funds.
The model is flexible to a wide range of interrogations. Both input Žcost. and output Žreturns. variables can
be changed by the user to reflect the peculiarity of individual fund circumstances. A future refinement could be
the use of Options Theory rather than a Decision Tree Analysis to explore dynamic outcomes of a staged
investment process. Further work could also be done on empirically validating the beta values used in the model
at each stage of investment. However, these interesting elaborations remain outside the initial model specification.

10. Model software
The authors are prepared to share their Excel spreadsheet model with academic colleagues and other
interested parties in the hope that it may be refined and improved by cooperative action. Requests for the model
from commercial users will be met on the condition that a contribution is made to Amnesty International.
