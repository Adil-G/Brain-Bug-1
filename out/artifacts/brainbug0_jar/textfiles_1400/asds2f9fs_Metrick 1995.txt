<-----Page 1----->A NaturalExperimentin "Jeopardy!"
By ANDREW METRICK*
Thispaper uses the television game show "Jeopardy!"as a natural experimentto
analyze behavior under uncertainty and the ability of players to choose strategic
best-responses. The results suggest that, while most players bet in a rational
manner, the failure rate for choosing best-responses increases as the betting
problem grows more complex and that players' choices are affected by the
"frame" of the problem. However, suboptimal betting tends to decrease as
inferiorplayers are drivenfrom the game. The data also allow for estimation of
the extent of risk aversion; the results imply near risk-neutrality.(JEL C72, C93,
D81)

Since Maurice Allais's famous experiment (Allais and Ole Hagen, 1979),
economists have documented considerable
evidence on individualchoice behaviorunder uncertainty.Yet, almost all of this evidence comes from laboratoryexperiments
and involves the use of small or imaginary
incentives.' This paper introducesevidence
from a naturalexperimentof a large-stakes
strategicdecision problem.The natural experiment is the television game show
"Jeopardy!"The cost, in prizes, of running
an equivalentexperimentin the laboratory
would be over 5 million dollars.
Television game shows provide an interesting opportunityfor economists.Many of
these shows are structuredso that, at some
point, players face well-defined decision

problems; often, these decision problems
are in the form of strategicgames.2On the
show Jeopardy, three players compete by
answering questions in various generalknowledge categories.3 In the first two
rounds,scores are accumulatedthroughthe
answersto 60 differentquestions.Then, the
first part of the game ends, and all players
who have a positive score advance to the
third and final round, called "Final Jeopardy." This round contains the strategic
game studied in this paper.
In Final Jeopardy(FJ), playersare shown
a single category from which they will be
asked one question.After seeing the scores
of the other players and the category(but
not the question), players are given several
minutes to compute a bet on the success of

"questionanswers."All clues on the boardare givenin
the formof statements(answers),and contestantswho
ring in must phrase their "answers"in the form of
questions.In orderto avoidconfusingthe reader,I use

their answer.Playerscannot bet more than
their score or less than zero. Then, the
question is revealed and players are given
30 seconds to write their answers. After
time has elapsed, the answersand bets are
revealed; correct answers are rewardedby
adding the bet to the score, and incorrect
answersare penalizedby subtractingthe bet
from the score. At the end of this round,
the playerwith the highest score is declared
the winner. This player is allowed to keep
her score in dollars and is invited back to
play the next day. The second- and thirdplace playersreceive prizes but do not keep
any of their score. In the event of a tie for
first, all tied playersget to keep the money
and returnthe next day. If a playerwins five
consecutivegames, then she is retired from
the show but invited to the Tournamentof
Champions,for large cash prizes, at the end
of the year.4
Since only the winner of the entire game
gets to keep her prize, the FJ betting problem is crucialto the players.The largeprizes
coupled with subjects who are well informed about the rules make this an interesting game for study. The additional advantageof a marketmechanism,in the form
of champions returningto play again and
poor players being "drivenout," gives this
problem further credibilityas a natural experiment. The purpose of this paper is to
use the data from this experimentto draw
inferenceabout riskattitudesand the ability
of playersto play best-responsesin strategic
situations. The main drawbackof using a
natural experimentis that there are many
factors left uncontrolled. For this reason,
the analysisin this paper is mostly descriptive, and my conclusionsdo not include any
definitivetests of choice theories.
The paper is organized as follows: Section I gives the notation for the paper, presents some basic data, and describesthe two
classes of the FJ problem studied in the
paper. Section II turns to the first of these

two classes in order to analyze behavior
under uncertainty.The "game" studied in
this section is not reallya game at all, since
it will encompass only situations in which
one player is so far ahead that she can
guaranteevictory.Her choice of actions in
this context provides large-stakesevidence
about risk aversion. The risk attitudes implied here show less risk-aversebehavior
than seen in the most comparable study.
Section III studies a class of FJ in whichthe
first- and second-place players bet against
each other and can mostly ignore the actions of the third-placeplayer. The objective here is to see whether the players are
playingbest-responsesto the observed"empirical frequency"of strategies played by
their opponents in my sample of similar
games. I call such bets "empirical-best-responses."'5 The evidence showsthat, for this
class of games, first-placeplayersalmost all
play empirical-best-responses.Conversely,
there is strong evidence that second-place
players do not choose empirical-bestresponses,and in addition,there are indications that their choices are affected by the
"frame" of the game. The difference in
performancebetween the first- and secondplace players seems to be the result of different levels of complexityin the strategic
problemsthat they must solve before making their bets. Also, there is evidence that
experienced players are more likely than
nonexperiencedplayers to play an empirical-best-response.Finally, Section IV provides a short discussionof the conclusions.

roundsof play. I rankthese playersby their
scores and denote them as the initial endowment vector

X = (x1,

X2,X3). Players are

then presented with a category, and they
must form an estimate of each player's
probabilityof correctly answering a question in this category.There are eight possible combinationsof correct/incorrect answers (states of nature) among the three
players. Let A = (a,, a2, a3) be the vector
that represents correct/incorrect answers,
with ai = 1 for correct answers and ai = 0
for incorrectanswers,and let Pi(A) be the
ith-place player'ssubjectiveprobabilitythat
state A will occur. From their initial scores,
subjective probability distributions of the
states, and beliefs about the bets of the
other players,each playermust choose some
bet Yi, yi < xi, so as to maximize the expected utility of her winnings. Let Y =
(Y1,Y2,y3) be the vector of these bets. Final
scores Z = (z1, z2, Z3), are calculated by
zi= xi + Yi if ai=1

and zi= xi- yi

if

ai = 0. The winner is the player with the
highest zi. In the event of a tie, all tied
players"win."The winner'sprize is to keep
her score in dollars.Second-and third-place
players do not keep any of their score, although they do get prizes. These prizes are
in the form of "goods,"not money,with the
second-place prize being more valuable.
This differenceis small, however,and in no
case would it exceed a few hundreddollars
in marketprice.

B. Data and Statistics

The data used in this paper were taken
from originalJeopardyprogramsbroadcast
between October 1989 and January1992.6
There are 393 total games yielding over
1,150 total decisions made by about 1,000
different subjects.Although I do not have
hard data on the characteristicsof Jeopardy
contestants, it is likely that they are, in
general,wealthierand better educatedthan

the average person.7 In Section II, I mention how this unrepresentativenessmay affect the results.
For all 393 games, the number of outcomes in each state A is given in Tables 1
and 2. Table 1 includesonly those games in
which all three players had positive scores
entering FJ. Table 2 includes data from all
games, including the 24 in which player 3

the beginningof the show, and they often discusstheir
hobbies or interests duringa short on-air conversion
between rounds.

states are presentedwith a3 ignored.
From these two tables, one can calculate
the frequencythat a player in the ith position answers correctly. These frequencies
are f(al = 1)= 225/393 = 0.57, f(a2 = 1)=
201.5/393 = 0.51 and f(a3 = 1) = 171.5/369
= 0.46. The fact that a player'sposition is a
significant predictor of his success in FJ
suggeststhat other statisticsmightmatteras
well. Surprisingly,if one controls for a
player'sposition, then the score, xi, has no
predictivepower. In a logit regressionof FJ
success (1 if right, 0 if wrong) on both
position and score, the coefficienton position is positive and significantat the 5-percent level, while the coefficienton score is
negative and insignificant. This implies that

it is the relative position among the three
playersthat predictsthe probabilityof winning and that the amountthey are ahead or
behind adds little predictivepower.
Since champions return to play again,
players contemplatingbets that give different probabilitiesof winning need to estimate the value of their future Jeopardy
earnings.Since these estimatesform an importantpart of the analysisin later sections,
it is useful to look at some sample statistics.
Defining W as the randomvariable representing future winnings for a first-time
champion,the sample frequenciesfor various ranges are given in Table 3. The expected value of W is $13,600in this sample.
Since estimatesof futurewinningsof multi-

243

game championsare similar,I will use the
same W for all players.8
Overall,one can split FJ into two mutually exclusive types of games: in the first,
player 1 is so far ahead of player 2 that
x1 ? 2x2. In this case, she can guarantee
winningby betting y1 < x1 - 2x2. The game
is then reduced to a pure individualmaximizationproblem,and one can analyzethe
implied risk attitudes given by player l's
choice of y1. For my sample, 110 of the 393
games are of this type, and these games are
studied in Section II. In the remaining283
games, xi <2x2. Here, at the very least,
player 2 can threaten player l's lead by
betting Y2= x2. In fact, it is this exact bet
whichplayer1 most often "defends"against,
since the most obvious betting regularityin
these games is the tendency for the firstplace player to bet just enough (by $1) to
"shutout" player 2 if both should answer
correctly: y1 = 2x2 - x1 + 1. This shutout
bet is observedin almost half of the games,
and when it is not made, the actual bet is
usually quite close to it. Table 4 presents
summarydata on ranges of y1 for the 283
games in which x1 < 2x2. To give a frameof
reference,note that the averagelevels of x1
and x2 for these games are, respectively,
$8,120 and $6,145.
Within the 283 games of this type, there
is a subclass of 76 games in which both
player 1 and player 2 have two main strategic options at their disposal and player 3's
score is low enough so that his actions can
be safely ignored. In Section III, I describe
this subclassand analyzeboth players'specific betting choices.

that she can guaranteewinningand advancing to the next game as champion.If x1 >
2x2, then, by setting any y1 < x1 -2x2,
player 1 can ensure that she keeps at least
x1- y1, which wins regardlessof player 2's
bet. Of course,there is no reasonwhyplayer
1 cannot bet more than x1 - 2x2, but she
would then risk losing her bet and the full
expectedvalue of future-winnings,
while she
could gain only the amount of her bet. In
general, player 1 is faced with the simple
problemof decidinghow much to wager on
the chance that she will answerthe FJ question correctly. A typical example of this
problemoccursif X = (10,000,2,000, 1,000).
Here, player1 can wagerany y1 < 6,000 and
still be sure of winning. If one knew her
subjective probability of answering correctly, then, as long as she chooses some
y1 < 6,000, it would be possible to form an
estimate for her coefficientof absolute risk
aversion. In this section, a related experiment is performed on the sample of 110
gameswhichsatisfyx1 2 2x2. Since I do not
know any player's subjectiveprobabilityof
answering correctly, it is not possible to
calculate specific risk parameters for any
individual.Instead, I make several assumptions that allow for an estimate of the risk
aversion of a representativeplayer in the
sample.

in the constraint that y1 must be small

Since none of the 110 players faced with
this decision violated this "constraint"and
bet more than x1 - 2x2, this formulationis
not inconsistent with the data. When the
constraintsdo not bind, the first-ordercondition of (1) impliesa solutionfor y1. In the

From this equation, if I had uncensored
y1 for every player and knowledgeof their

an a for every individual.Since this information is not available, I instead estimate
an a for the "representative"player, that
is, the constantvalue of a that is most likely
to resultin the observedsampleof bets (y1)
and correct/incorrectanswers(a1). To obtain this a, it is necessaryto first make the
assumptionthat there is no error in player

allows equation(2) to be written as

P

exp(2ayl)

1 + exp(2ay1)

Since this is exactly the form of a logit
regression, it is possible to calculate the
level of a in a straightmaximum-likelihood
forwardway;with a, as the dependentvariable and y1 as the independent variable,
the slope coefficientis a consistentestimate
of 2 a.10 This formulationalso allows for a
simple handling of the censoring on y1.
Since I am estimatingthe likelihoodof correct answers (p) conditional on bets (y1),
any subset of the bets can be droppedwithout introducingbias. Therefore, I drop the
two observationswhere y = 0 and the four
observations where y1 = xl - 2x2. This
leaves 104 uncensored observations.Using
this sample, the point estimate is 0.000066
for a, with a standard error of 0.000056.
Since this estimate is not significantlydifferent from 0, I cannot reject a null hypothesis that the representativeplayer is riskneutral.'1Note that the model also implies
that there is no intercept term in equation
(2'). The evidencedoes not rejectthis implication;for the intercept,the point estimate
is - 0.179 with a standarderrorof 0.297.

10I am grateful to Michael Boozer and Orley
Ashenfelterfor suggestingthis logit estimation.
"1Thereare severalother reasonableapproachesto
the censoringproblem;the approachused in the text
leads to a comparativelyhigh estimate for a. For
example,out of 110 playersin our sample,20 chose to
or $1 below the conbet exactly yj=xj-2x2-1,
straintused in the model. It is likelythat most of these
playerschose this bet because they preferredto win
outrightratherthan allowthe possibilityfor a tie. Since
I did not explicitlymodel this preference,the estimation treated these 20 playersas unconstrained.If, instead,these observationsare droppedfromthe sample,
then one obtains a point estimate of 0.000037for a,
with a standarderrorof 0.000061.Also, it is possibleto
relax the assumptionthat player 1 correctlycalculates
y1 and simultaneouslymodel the censoringthrougha
Tobit estimation of equation (2). Then, by making
assumptionsaboutthe calculationerrorand the distributionof p in the sample,one can backout a value for
representativea; for a wide range of reasonableassumptions,the resultingestimatesfor a are very similar to those obtainedunderthe logit estimationof (2').
Details of these computationscan be obtained from
the author.

To get a visceral sense for the risk attitudes implied by a, the point estimate can
be translatedinto a certaintyequivalentof
4,190 for the lottery(10,000,0.5)-a lottery
which gives a 50-percentchance at winning
$10,000and a 50-percentchance at winning
nothing. This certaintyequivalent "seems"
high; for example, Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky(1979) reportthat the majority of certaintyequivalentsfor a (1,000, 0.5)
lottery fall between $300 and $400. To go
beyond a visceral sense for this result, it is
necessaryto look to related research.
Most other empiricalstudies of risk aversion focus on estimatingthe coefficient of
relativerisk aversion,12but since I lack data
on wealth levels of the players,it is difficult
to make useful comparisonswith this literature. However, a recent paper by Gertner
(1993) provides a remarkablysimilar data
set. In this work,the authorlooked at choice
behaviorin the televisiongame show "Card
Sharks,"where the "bonus" round of play
provides a well-defined betting problem
playedfor largestakes.He calculatesa lower
bound for a of 0.000310.13 This is more
than four standard errors above the estimate here of an a for the representative
player. One possible partialexplanationfor
this large disparityis that Jeopardycontestants are wealthier than those in Card
Sharks,and my constant-absolute-risk-aversion specificationhas hidden the fact that
absolute risk aversionactuallydeclines with
higherwealth levels. This explanationis not
implausible.Anotherpossibilityis that players are overestimatingtheir probabilityof
success; if subjective estimates of p are
systematicallyhigher than the sample average, then playerswill appearless risk-averse

12The most extensive work in this area is by
Kenneth R. MacCrimmonand Donald A. Wehrung
(1986).See RalphL. Keeneyand HowardRaiffa(1976)
for a surveyof earlier studies. Other work has been
carried out using stock-marketdata by researchers
primarilyinterested in testing stock-markettheories,
but informationabout relative risk aversion is also
estimated(LarryG. Epsteinand StanleyE. Zin, 1991).
13Gertner (1993) also findsevidencethat playersdo
not bet accordingto expectedutilitytheory.Becauseof
this finding,his estimatesof a should be viewed descriptively.

than they actuallyare. In CardSharks,players deal with computablerisks, and should
not suffer from this bias. This "overestimation of success"could also explain some of
the results of the next section.

such that 7,000- Y22 5,999. Any bet satisfying this restrictionwill win for player 2
whenever a1= 0. The simplest Low bet is
Y2= 0, but of course any Y2< 1,001will also
do. The second strategyfor player 2 is, not
surprisingly,to play High. "High"strategies
are representedby all bets Y2> 1,001.When
Yi = 4,001, High bets only win when a1 = 0

and a2 = 1. By this strategy, player 2 is
saying,"I will sacrificemy addedprobability
of winning in return for a higher payoff
when I do win." Given that player 2 only
wins (and keeps his money) when his answer is right, the naturalHigh bet is to bet
everything,Y2= 7,000.This intuitionis reinforced by the fact that about 10 percent of
first-placeplayers bet exactly y1 = 4,000 in
these types of games. In this specific case,
Y2= 7,000will tie when a1 = a2 = 1, whereas
other High bets less than 7,000will not. For
this reason I give the bet of Y2= x2= 7,000
a special name of All.
The importanceof the restriction3x2 >
2x1 becomes clear if one limits attentionto
the focal bet. If, say, X = (10,000, 6,000,
1,000), then the focal bet for player 1 is

The exampleof "runawaygames"is not a
very interestingstrategicproblem. Player 1
has a decision to make, but as long as she
does not violate the constraintthat Y1< x1
-2x2, she need not concern herself with
the behavior of the second- or third-place
players.When x1 < 2x2, however,this is no
longer the case. In these situations,player2
can always challenge player 1 by betting,
Y22 X1 - x2, thus forcingplayer1 to choose
a bet based on her estimates of the. probabilities of the final states. This strategic
problem becomes more interesting as x1

occurrences of this special case are not included in the

B. A Puzzle
The behaviorof players 1 and 2 in these
games is shown in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.The importanceof the specificranges
used in the tableswill become cleareras the
analysisprogresses.
Note here that player 1 makes the focal
bet of 2x2 - x1 +1 in over half of the games.
In seven games she chooses to bet exactly
y= 2x2 - x1, thus allowing player 2 the
possibility of tying the game. In only two
games did player 1 bet below 2x2- x 1, and
in neither of these games was y1 < x1 - x2.
In one game player 1 bet y1 = x1. The remaining22 bets were close to the focal bet,
most within $100 of it. The behavior of
player 2 has been separated into three
groups.The firstgroupconsistsof bets Y2<
3x2 - 2x1, the second group includes all
other bets except Y2= x2, and the third
group contains the bet Y2= x2. I refer to
these groupsas "Low,""High,"and "All,"
respectively.
As mentioned in the Introduction, the
methodologyhere is to determinewhether
the players are generally choosing to bet

rationalityof any one individual.Instead, I
analyzebehaviorin the aggregate,assuming
that playershold beliefs whichare similarto
the sample frequencies.
Consider first the behavior of player 2.
Given the behavior of player 1, one can
calculatethe expected utilityof a representative member of the Low, High, and All

groups. For the Low group, Y2= 0; for the
High group, Y2= x2 -1; for the All group,
Y2 = x2. These are the modal choices within
each group, and a different representative
memberwould not change the main results.
If one substitutes the sample frequencies
from Table 5 for player 2's beliefs about
playerl's bet, then it is possibleto calculate
what the empirical-best-responsewould be
for any utilityfunction.15Under this framework, the expected utility of each of these
bets is as follows.
(i) For Y2 = O,
(3) [P2(0, 1) + P2(0,O)] U(x2 + WU)
In the 76 games of this type, the bet of
Y2= 0 wouldwin wheneverplayer1 is wrong,

since none of the games in the sample had
player 1 bet y1 < x1 - x2. Thus, the payoff
to this bet is x2 + Wu in both states (0, 1)
and (0,0).
(ii) For Y2= x2 -1,

The bet y2 = X2-1 always wins in state
(0, 1), and also wins in state (1,1) whenever
y1 < 2x2 - x1 (3 percent of the time, from
Table 5) and in state (0,0) when y1 = x1 (1
percent of the time). In the first two cases,
the payoffis 2x2 -1 + Wu, and in the third
case the payoffis 1 + Wu.

The bet Y2= x2 alwayswins in state (0,1)
and also wins in state (1,1) whenever Y1<
2x2 - x1 (12 percent of the time). The payoff in both of these states is 2x2 + WU.
One can see from this analysis that the
expected utility of Y2= x2 must be higher

The bet of Y2= x2 has the possibility of
tying at z2 = z= 2x2 in state (1, 1). This
can occurwhen player1 bets y1= 2x2 -x1
which she did seven times in 76 games. By
betting y2 = X2-1, player 2 gives up this
chance to tie in returnfor the possibilityof
winning the game at z2 = 1 in state (0,0).

bets such as Y2= x2-1.

16Readersmaywonderhow these calculationswould
be changed if one tried to incorporatenonmonetary
values into the utility functions. It is impossible to
know the full extent of this distortion,but the most
likely effect would be to throw more weight on Wu,
since playersare apt to place the most nonmonetary
value upon winning the game and returningto play
again.

18Trebekand Barsocchini(1990 p. 70) suggestthat
some playersare motivatedby the desire to finish in
second place instead of third place because of the

differencein prizesfor these two final positions.However, even if one allows the differencein prizes to be

High bets are made in games where the third-place
player has already been eliminated and player 2 is
guaranteedat least second place. Hence, I ignorethe

Notes: The table contains the results of four logit regressions with independent
variable LOWYES2. LOWYES2 equals 1 if player 2 bet Low and equals 0 otherwise.
The variable x2 is player 2's score (in dollars); a2 represents player 2's FJ answer (1 if
correct, 0 if incorrect). RATIO is equal to x2/x1, the ratio of player 2's score to
player l's score. CHAMP2 is a discrete variable equal to the number of games that
player 2 has previously won. Numbers in parentheses are asymptotic t statistics.

utility functions.19Thus, using sample frequencies of the states for beliefs indicates
that Low should be chosen over All. The
observed pattern, however, is that 32 players chose All and only 18 players chose
Low. The preference for High over Low is
even more difficultto justify.
Even if one drops the assumption that
beliefs are close to the sample frequencies,
it is still possible to draw testable implications from this framework.Returningto the
inequalityin (6), one can say for sure that,
holding estimates of Wu constant, the size
of x2 should have an impacton the betting
decision;if x2 is relativelylarge,then player
2 would be more likely to forgo the increased chance of winningfor a higherpayoff today.To test this prediction,I regressa

will

place relatively more weight

on the denominatorof the left-handside of
(6) than on the numerator.This makes the
inequalityless likely to hold, and the player
more likely to choose to play All over Low.
One possible explanation for the modal
choice of All over Low is that playerswho
bet All have private information which
makes their estimates of P2(a2 = 1) significantly higher than the sample average.
Lackingdata on P2(a2 = 1), I use player2's
realized success, a2, as a proxyand include
it as a regressoron LOWYES2.
Table 7 contains the results from four
different logit regressions for LOWYES2.

All if 19WU > x2. Since the sample mean of W is
$13,600 and the maximum observed value of x2 is
$11,800, it would be very surprising if any risk-neutral
player did not satisfy 19WU > x2. For risk-averse players, this inequality is even more extreme, and the
necessary level of Wu drops to zero when 1.95 =
U(2x2)/U(x2). Only risk-loving players might prefer
All to Low. In this case, however, the certainty equivalent Wu, would be higher than its expected value, so
that even pessimistic estimates of Wu would be high
relative to x2. Thus, in order for (7) not to hold, a
player would need the unusual combination of risk-loving preferences and extremely pessimistic beliefs.

tween the betting behavior of players who
eventually answered correctly and the behaviorof playerswho did not. Equation(6)
implies that the coefficienton a2 should be
negative. Regressions(ii), (iii), and (iv) find
that the coefficient on a2 is positive and
insignificant.This finding also fails to support the hypothesisthat players are choosing empirical-best-responses.
Using the same method, one can easily
calculatethat player 1 is makinga bet close
to the empirical-best-responsein all but a
few of the games. Since the vast majorityof
second-placeplayers are choosing Y2 close
to x2, the best response for player 1 is to
make the shutout bet. This fact is fairly
intuitive,so there is no need to replicatethe
calculationsthat were performedfor player
2. The two first-placeplayers who bet less
than the shutoutbet may have made errors,
or they may just have had very low private
estimates of P1(a1 = 1). Either way, one can

safely conclude that, as a group, first-place
playersare havingno problemfindingtheir

expected-utilityfunctions.2' Indeed, player
2 seems to violate dominance when he
chooses a High bet, and this is a serious
problem for every normative theory of
choice. There are, however, several wellstudied biases in probabilistic reasoning
which can aid in explaining the results.22
Unfortunately,there is no way of testing the
validityof any of these explanationsagainst
each other. It is possible, however, to test
for evidenceof one specificdecision-making
bias: "framing."
Framing.-One possible explanationfor
player 2's difficultiesrelative to player 1 is
that his strategicproblemis more difficult;
the calculationof a Low bet is "one-step"
harder than the calculationof the shutout
bet. Thus, one might expect player 2 to
choose Low more often in games when the
possibilityof a Low bet is easier to compute. I attempt here to determinewhether
this type of framingmatters.In Table 7, the
third explanatoryvariable, RATIO, is a

21
Most non-expected-utilitytheories were developed as a reaction to criticismof the independence
axiom. Since most of the Jeopardydata consist of a
single observationper player, axiomatictheories that
rely on droppingor weakeningthe independenceaxiom will not explain the results. Another possibility,
regret theory(David Bell, 1982;GrahamLoomes and
Robert Sugden, 1982), is an unlikelyexplanationbecause it would implythat the size of player2's score,
x2, should have an even larger negativeeffect on his
decision to play Low than is suggestedby expectedutility theory. Table 6 shows no evidence that score
mattersat all.
22Biasesthat can help explainthe resultshave the
effect of overweightingthe numerator and underweighting the denominatorof the left-hand side of
inequality(6). Examplesof such biases are studied in

players have a preference for betting "actively"(as
discussedin JackOchs and AlvinE. Roth [1989]),then
this would partiallyexplain the results as well. I am

point to my attention.

of player1, there is no reasonthat a "closer"
game, represented by a higher RATIO,
should make it more likely that player 2
bets low. Nevertheless, the coefficient on
RATIO is positive and significant at the
5-percentlevel. One intuitivereasonfor this
result is that a closer game makesit simpler
for player2 to notice the possibilityof making a Low bet. It is difficult to find an
alternativeexplanation.23

multiple experiences in games of the type
studied in Section III, one finds that no
repeat players switched to a Low bet after
making a High or All bet in a previous
game. Even if the study is expanded to
include other similarsituations,there is no
evidence that learning explains any part of
the positive coefficienton CHAMP2.25

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

Low bettors in the population.Achievinga
high score and placingoneself in a position
to win are aided by sound strategyat many
points during the game. FJ is the easiest
part to study, but (betting) success here
should not be uncorrelatedwith success in
the earlier parts of the game. The evidence
indicatesthat this may be the largestfactor
influencingthe improvementin betting performanceby champions.
IV. Conclusions

This paper has used a television game
show as a naturalexperimentto studyhighstakes decision-making.The results suggest
two main themes aboutchoice behavior:the
first concerns "static" aspects, while the
second concerns"dynamic"aspects.
1. Although choices are not always optimal,
they still tend to conform to patterns.

Manyplayersoverestimatetheir abilities
or fail to notice that a specific option is
available; in either case, however, the
mistakesthey make are not random,but
seem to be similaracross differentindividuals. This observation supports the
existence of "stylized facts" of boundedly rationalchoice behavior.
2. Suboptimal choice can persist despite the
three mitigating factors of high stakes, an
identifiable market mechanism, and an
opportunity for players to learn. In the

case of Final Jeopardy,the most important of these mitigating factors is the
marketmechanism,and its role in driving out inferior players can be quantified. Nevertheless,since all three factors
togetherare not sufficientto force "convergence"to optimal choices, the question remains:what would be sufficient?
This question can only be answeredby
furtherempiricalstudies.
