Using repertory grid to identify intangibles in
business plans
ENRIQUE DÍAZ DE LEÓN and PAUL D. GUILD
(Final version accepted 8 January 2003)

The assessment of intangibles in business plans by investors is an important factor of recent
interest, particularly in the evaluation of early-stage technology-based ventures. On one
hand, investors are challenged to properly assess new opportunities. At the same time,
entrepreneurs or innovators face the formidable task of communicating what is, sometimes,
nothing more than just an ‘extraordinary’ idea. In such situations, the decision to continue
with the due diligence process, and ﬁnally to invest, is based frequently on those aspects that
are intangible. In an attempt to reveal some of the intangibles assessed by investors and
communicated by entrepreneurs, an investigation was conducted using repertory grid, a
technique based on personal construct psychology. Five venture capitalists and ﬁve
entrepreneurs were interviewed. Evidence was found for the importance of intangibles
during the investment-decision process of early stage technology-based ventures. For these
ventures, the consideration of only tangible criteria is not a guaranteed predictor of success.
The repertory grid technique makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the identiﬁcation of
intangibles assessed by investors and communicated by entrepreneurs.

Introduction
As deﬁned by Guild and Bachher (1996), technology-based ventures are
‘those companies intending to commercialize a technology for the ﬁrst time
and thereby expecting to derive a signiﬁcant source of sustainable
competitive advantage from the technology’. What is considered an
intangible aspect of such a venture is one that cannot be readily perceived
or is not capable of being appraised at an actual or approximate value.
Examples of intangible aspects are knowledge, intellectual capital, skills,
abilities, beliefs and ideas, among others (Bachher et al. 1999).

As Stewart (1997), Shepherd and Douglas (1999), Sullivan (1999) and
Smart (1999) have argued, traditional approaches to ﬁnancial assessment
based on concrete aspects are perceived as less reliable and relevant.
Correspondingly, there is an increasing interest in the proper assessment
and communication of intangible aspects. This occurs largely because of
the evolution towards a knowledge-based economy, one in which intangible
factors play more of a role. Stewart (1997), for example, highlights the
importance of intellectual capital. He argues that ‘knowledge has become
the primary ingredient of what we make, do, buy, and sell’. As a result, he
points out, ‘managing it—ﬁnding and growing intellectual capital, storing
it, selling it, sharing it—has become the most important economic task of
individuals, businesses, and nations’. Beyond a national perspective, Pope
John Paul II afﬁrmed the increasing signiﬁcance of ‘know-how, technology, and skill’ in his 1991 encylical Centesimus Annus, writing, ‘whereas at
one time the decisive factor of production was the land, and later capital . . .
today the decisive factor is increasingly man himself, that is, his
knowledge.’
When potential investors assess a business plan, they usually focus on
such concrete attributes as the proposed balance sheet and predicted cash
ﬂows. However, these ﬁnancial indicators do not accurately reﬂect all the
possibilities for success that technology-based ventures frequently offer.
The results of such traditional assessments often lead to the rejection of
potentially viable technology-based ventures. However, when evaluating
these investment opportunities, expert analysts frequently face approximate or soft data, often presented linguistically. In this case, subjective
qualitative evaluations presented by the entrepreneur through a business
plan lie at the heart of the decision to be made. This is particularly the case
for new technology-based ventures in their early stages. In many such
ventures, the investment opportunity consists of an idea presented by a
team of energetic innovators who are convinced of its value. There is no
convincing balance sheet or predicted cash ﬂow.
Assessing intangibles is thus a challenging task for investors. Although
no prior research exists to suggest venture capital ‘accuracy rates’ when
assessing intangibles, anecdotal evidence conﬁrms that this is a most
troublesome factor to assess accurately (Dubini 1989, Harvey and Lusch
1995). Kozmetsky et al. (1985: 5) described this problem succinctly: ‘The
talent criteria [intangibles], perhaps the most important quality a venture
capitalist looks for in a portfolio company, is also one of the most difﬁcult
areas to assess’. David Gladstone (1988: 30), when president of a public
venture capital ﬁrm, reported: ‘The problem with the venture capital
business is that when we analyse people, our perceptions of others are
usually wrong’. Smart (1999) corroborated this ﬁnding with the results of
his study. He found that venture capitalists fail to achieve an accurate
human capital valuation in 57% of the deals. That is, investors experience
signiﬁcant surprises in their assessment of intangibles over half of the time.
There is deﬁnitely a need for an accurate method to elicit and measure some
of the intangibles in business plans.
A review of the literature suggests that repertory grid might be a
valuable tool for eliciting intuitions and personal experience (Ford et al.

1990, Hisrich and Jankowicz 1990). Stewart and Stewart (1982) allude to it
as a technique that appears to offer a highly relevant framework and
methodology for mapping the decisions investors have made in the past—
decisions that, consciously or unconsciously, will affect their perceptions
and judgements in the future.
Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990) used repertory grid technique to study
intuition in venture capital decisions. Their study was not particularly
focused on technology-based ventures. However, they found that some
aspects of the investment decision used by venture capitalists have been less
researched, in particular the nature and extent of decisions involving
intuition, ‘personal chemistry’ or ‘gut feeling’. They emphasize not only
the content of venture capitalists’ constructs—what they actually say about
the proposals used—but also the way investors concretize their intuitions
about a typical proposal.
Repertory grid is a technique developed by Kelly (1955) based on the
rationale that people assign signiﬁcance to all phenomena utilizing their
own construct system. Kelly wanted to develop an investigative technique
that would remove the inﬂuence of the observer’s frame of reference on
what was observed. In addition, he was interested in a method that would
enable him to make precise statements—and conﬁdent predictions—about
the behaviour of individual people.
With these concerns in mind, Kelly developed his theory of personal
constructs over the years. Kelly’s theory rests on the assumption that
people are actively engaged in making sense of, and extending, their
experience: he expressed this most succinctly in the deﬁnition ‘man is a
scientist’. According to Kelly, the degree to which we understand other
people—or ourselves—is measured by the extent to which we understand
how they make sense of their experience. The term ‘personal construct’ in
Kelly’s theory refers to the set of models, hypotheses or representations
that each person has made about his or her world. Kelly invented repertory
grid interviewing as a way of getting people to reveal their own personal
models.
Essentially, in a grid procedure a number of objects or elements are
compared by judging these on several attributes or constructs. Kelly’s own
application of personal construct theory was restricted to the technical
setting and was but loosely tied to the implementation of the repertory grid
technique. Subsequent clinical applications have emphasized the grid
technique itself as both a diagnostic instrument and a therapeutic tool
(Adams-Webber 1979, Bannister and Fransella 1986). Later applications,
in the ﬁeld of education, have stressed the individual nature of personal
construct systems and their abstraction from the grid (Bell 1990). In the
ﬁeld of expert systems design, the grid has been explored as a tool for
knowledge acquisition and inference structure derivation (Boose 1988).
Additionally, the technique has been a rather popular method for
automated knowledge acquisition (Shaw and Gaines 1987). However, it
has been most appropriately applied as a tool for the development of
knowledge-based systems, when the solutions to the problem at issue can
be enumerated and judged on their degree of similarity. This makes it a
suitable technique for the present investigation.

Moreover, as described by Ford et al. (1990), genuine expertise is more
than the successful accumulation of ‘book knowledge’. This seems to be the
case in most interesting domains, for example, in the assessment or
communication of investment proposals. In fact, much of an expert’s
unique collection of knowledge and skills are of his or her own
construction. In other words, human experts acquire their expertise not
only from explicit knowledge such as that found in textbooks (i.e. widely
shared consensual beliefs), but also from personal experience. Consequently, they construct a repertory of working hypotheses, or ‘rules of
thumb’, which, combined with their fund of book knowledge, make them
expert practitioners (Agnew and Brown 1989).
Several studies have reported that when domain experts are asked to
explain how they have reached a given conclusion, they often construct
plausible lines of reasoning that have little or no relevance to their actual
problem-solving methods (Johnson 1983, Ford et al. 1990). As described
by Waterman (1986), the more competent domain experts become, the less
able they are to describe the knowledge they use to solve problems. Thus,
the greater their expertise, the more the experts’ schemata or construct
systems can deviate from those of typical practitioners, and the greater the
importance of personally constructed knowledge. Consequently, experts
may not be able to verbalize the incremental knowledge responsible for
their evolution. One possible explanation of this problem is the lack of a
shared method for expressing it. In other words, each expert has developed
a unique collection of functional, but fallible hypotheses (i.e. a personal
construct system). In some important respects, these hypotheses do not
coincide with publicly available domain knowledge, making it difﬁcult to
state explicitly. However, perhaps herein lies the most signiﬁcant facet of
expertise. From this perspective, repertory grid seems to be a tool able to
bring the experts’ self-constructed knowledge to the surface—making
explicit the valuable heuristic knowledge that experts possess but are
frequently unable to articulate (Dı́az de León 2001).
The following study thus explores the possibility of using the repertory
grid technique to enhance the traditional assessment of business plans by
including estimates of venture viability, which have greater predictive
validity. The assessment of investment opportunities seems limited by the
ability to communicate those aspects that are intangible. We assume that in
order to enhance our understanding of this process we should observe not
only a perspective from the investor but also the expertise of those who
have been successful in transmitting the value of a new idea. Thus, we
consider two kinds of experts: expert investors and expert entrepreneurs.
Venture capitalists are considered experts in new venturing ﬁnancing
(Zacharakis and Meyer 1998). In our study, we selected these experts from
a group of venture capitalists investing in technology-based ventures in
Canada. Professional venture capital is deﬁned as the funding provided by
ﬁrms of such full-time professionals. One of their objectives is to invest
alongside management in new, rapidly growing or changing ventures that
have the potential to develop into signiﬁcant competitors in global markets.
As discussed by Timmons and Sapienza (1992), the successful
development of a business can be critically impacted by the interaction of

<-----Page 4----->INTANGIBLES IN BUSINESS PLANS

139

the involved venture capitalists with the management team. Interestingly,
venture-capital backed ventures have been found to achieve a higher
survival rate than non-venture-capital backed business (Zacharakis and
Meyer 1998). The expertise of venture capitalists derives from the number
of business plans and proposals they usually assess, sometimes 100 or more
a month, from which they typically invest in only one to three (Timmons
1994).
This study also includes a second group of experts, successful ‘hightech’ entrepreneurs in Canada. Their expertise is based on their experience
of successfully launching a technology-based venture. The importance of
such experts comes from the complementary knowledge that they
incorporate into understanding some of the current demands placed on
business plans for new technology-based ventures.
Reliability, signiﬁcance and validity of repertory grids

Considering the broad application of different forms of repertory grids to
different domains of human expertise, it is obvious that the question
regarding the validity and reliability of repertory grids cannot be answered
(Bannister and Fransella 1986). As mentioned by Smith and Stewart
(1977), from a methodological viewpoint, it is doubtful if concepts of
reliability and validity can be applied to ideographic uses of the grid. Kelly
himself referred to ‘reliability’ (speciﬁcally test-retest) of the grid as a
measure of how much the person has failed to develop since the last time
(Ryle 1975). Slater (1976) illustrates this concept with a convincing
argument: ‘the reliability and signiﬁcance of a grid cannot be investigated
by the methods used for a battery of tests given to a group of subjects’.
Then, he elaborates ‘the reason is that the theory from which psychometric
methods for measuring reliability and signiﬁcance are derived assumes that
samples can be drawn at random from an objectively deﬁned population.
The assumption can be satisﬁed by the nomothetic [actual] data in a table of
test scores but not by the ideographic data of a grid’. Slater further argues
that to assess the signiﬁcance of a grid, one should test the null hypothesis
by asking this question: ‘What is the probability that I would obtain these
results by chance alone?’ As a step towards answering this question, he
produced the program GRANNY, which generates random numbers for
grids of any speciﬁed size. For example, one hundred 10 6 10 random grids
had a ﬁrst component accounting for an average of 30% of the variance
(standard deviation 0.0635). Thus, a 10 6 10 experimental grid which ﬁrst
component accounts for more than twice this percentage of the variation is
almost certainly not random and almost certainly has some additional
signiﬁcance. Such is the case with all our experiment results (see table 2).
Notwithstanding these very persuasive arguments, some researchers have
attempted to assess reliability and validity of the grid in conventional terms.
For example, Epting (1975) obtained test-retest reliabilities of grids in
three areas of 0.65, 0.62 and 0.64.
Fransella and Bannister (1977) also provide a detailed consideration of
reliability. They argue, ‘If we consider forms of grid to be attempts to

<-----Page 5----->140

ENRIQUE DÍAZ DE LEÓN AND PAUL D. GUILD

enquire into a person’s construct system then under what circumstances
would we expect stability or change?’ They conclude this way: ‘We should
look to the grid not to repeat the same result but to see, when it shows
change, what it is signifying. In short, reliability is perhaps best seen as
merely one aspect of validity’.
The validity of the grid itself is also complex to assess. With respect to
construct validity, however, there is considerable evidence in the literature
that the results obtained from repertory grid studies are consistent with the
assumptions underlying personal construct theory (Adams-Weber 1979).
Perhaps more relevant to the topic of this study is the research related to
measuring predictive validity of grids in management studies. Bender
(1976) reports a study in which grids were used to predict the behaviour of
certain men towards other people. These predictions were then validated
against their wives’ reports of actual behaviour towards the same people.
The results were highly signiﬁcant (p = 0.00006). Fransella and Bannister
(1967) attempted to forecast voting preferences from the results of a grid
with 10 people known to the subjects as elements. Five hypotheses were
tested, and the authors concluded, ‘The repertory grid has both concurrent
and predictive validity when used as a measure of political construing’.
Method
Constructing a repertory grid involves the selection of a topic, which in our
study is intangibles in business plans, and the generation of a list of items,
called elements, relating to that topic. The elements help to deﬁne the kind
of conversation to have with the expert. There are several themes related to
intangibles in business plans. However, we are particularly interested in
obtaining a better understanding of how experts assess such intangibles.
Therefore, it makes sense to use actual business plans of various kinds as
elements in the interview.
Perhaps the best analogy when thinking about choice of elements is to
consider what surveyors do when mapping out a new piece of ground. They
start by selecting a series of key points on that piece of ground: salient
features, such as church spires, hilltops or ponds. Then, when they have
the salient features identiﬁed they take a series of measurements between
the features, which give them more and more data about the territory until
they are ready to draw the complete map. It is rather as if when eliciting
constructs one is looking at the relationships between features on the map,
and the elements themselves can be thought of as the features from which
the surveyor starts when mapping the territory. From this analogy, one
might infer that the number of elements in an interview session is not as
relevant as the precision with which each element is deﬁned and the range
selected over the elements’ area (Adams-Webber 1979, Stewart and
Stewart 1982, Shaw and Gaines 1987).
The elicitation session proceeded with an open interview as follows.
Each interviewee was asked to recall six business plans. Such investment
proposals, from early stage technology-based ventures, had to have been
assessed or created during the previous 18 months. It is important to note

<-----Page 6----->INTANGIBLES IN BUSINESS PLANS

141

that speciﬁc details about the ventures remained completely conﬁdential
since each interviewee was asked only to recall such investments. The six
business plans became the elements under examination and were
distributed as follows:
.
.
.

been

business plans considered ‘big hits;
business plans considered ‘average or marginal’;
business plans that were rejected or where the investment had
lost.

During the interview, we randomly selected three plans from the training
set and presented them to the expert who had originally remembered them.
We then asked the expert to distinguish between these plans so that two of
them shared an intangible not possessed by the third. This property we
called a construct. Such constructs were categorized by each expert as
bipolar attributes in such terms as ‘good management skills/poor management skills’, ‘experienced entrepreneur/inexperienced entrepreneur’ and so
forth. In other words, this method involves selecting groups of three
elements (triads) from the list of elements (business plans), and the expert
is then invited to say in what way two of the plans are alike and in what way
the third plan is different from the other two in terms of its intangible
aspects. This procedure is intended to produce two contrasting poles for
the construct, although it is sometimes suggested that the poles should be
opposites. However, the difﬁculty with requesting ‘opposites’ is that it
tends to produce logical opposites rather than opposites in meaning. For
example, the logical opposite of ambitious is not ambitious; but the expert
may think of the real opposite of ambitious, as being does not trample on
colleagues. Clearly, the latter, contrasting, approach indicates far more
about the meaning of the construct.
Next, we provided the expert with a simple ﬁve-point rating scale. Once
a construct had been elicited, the expert assigned each of the six plans a
value from one to ﬁve. For example, a value of one could be assigned to a
plan in one pole of the construct, say ‘experienced entrepreneur’.
Correspondingly, a value of ﬁve would be assigned to another element on
the other pole of the construct, in this case ‘inexperienced entrepreneur’.
The technique proceeded to elicit all further constructs from the expert
by presenting successive fresh triads of plans. The expert could then add
important constructs that may not have been possible with the random
combination of plans being presented. All the ratings elicited from the
expert were structured in the form of a matrix known as repertory grid.
Figure 1 shows an example of a completed repertory grid: how one of
the respondents construed the six business plans. The text describes the
results of four kinds of analysis: a content analysis, which classiﬁes the
constructs provided by the respondents (table 1); a cluster analysis, which
shows the ways in which each respondent grouped his constructs together,
indicating the patterns of meaning he perceived (ﬁgures 2–11); a principal
components analysis, which shows the main concerns underlying his
thinking (ﬁgures 12 and 13) and an extremity analysis, identifying each
person’s most meaningful constructs (table 4).

Results
We elicited 149 constructs from the 10 interviewees. Out of those, a total of
83 constructs were obtained from the ﬁve investors. Correspondingly, the
ﬁve entrepreneurs provided 66 constructs. The constructs were contentanalysed following a standard procedure proposed by Honey (1977). Table
1 summarizes the content of the constructs classiﬁed in six main category
headings.
A two-stage process checked the reliability of the classiﬁcation scheme.
First, we grouped similar constructs together. Once we were satisﬁed with
the classiﬁcation of all the constructs, they were randomized, and two
independent researchers were asked to reassign the constructs to the six

categories. Their respective success rates were 84% and 73%. We then
discussed and amended the category scheme based on the inaccurate
assignments. For example, we renamed two of the categories to better
reﬂect the theme of the constructs they were grouping. The last step
consisted of randomizing and assigning the constructs to the new set of
categories; on this occasion, the constructs were successfully reassigned in
89% and 86% of the cases by two other researchers.
One interesting ﬁnding of this study is the similarity between
investors and entrepreneurs in terms of their assessments of importance. A quick look at the number of constructs from each group shows
that both investors and entrepreneurs regard the management skills of
the founder (or management team) to be critical. This category includes
not only the skills of the management team but also their core
competencies, abilities and business acumen. The category thus
includes constructs related to the personality of the entrepreneur.
Examples of these include honesty, integrity, passion and business
etiquette.
The results presented here represent constructs in the exact way they
were communicated by the experts in this study. This is important to
note, since, for example, considering the complete list of constructs, one
could misinterpret a false suggestion that skills, abilities and competencies have the same connotation. The relevance of this matter resides
somewhat in recent debates aimed at understanding differences between
abilities and attitudes (Douglas and Shepherd 2000). However, one
characteristic of the repertory grid technique is to avoid ‘contaminating’

entrepreneur. Also, having ‘good business etiquette’ seemed to be
decisive for some investors. When asked for an elaboration, one
investor stated, ‘if they don’t show any courtesy with us as partners,
how could we expect that they will respect and anticipate their
customers’ needs?’
Grid analysis
Once the summary of the general results was complete, we analysed each
grid following three separate procedures. First, we cluster-analysed the
data in order to identify ways in which the individual respondents
structured their thinking about investment applications. As a second test,
we completed a principal component analysis on each grid to gain an idea of
the cognitive complexity of each respondent. Afterwards, we also calculated
the rating extremity, a measure frequently interpreted as an indication of
the importance or ‘meaningfulness’ to the subject of a given construct or
element (Bonarius 1977).

Cluster analysis

Using software based on the FOCUS technique (Jankowicz and Thomas
1982, 1983), the grids were cluster-analysed. This technique uses a nearestneighbour distance metric. In other words, the algorithm depends on a
two-way cluster analysis based on pattern recognition, grouping items
(elements and constructs) by their interrelationship. That is, the FOCUS

appear side by side. As mentioned by Shaw (1980), the result is a graphic
representation of patterns of groupings of elements on constructs and
constructs on elements. This technique provides a personal theory from
each respondent employed either when making a funding decision (venture
capitalist) or when presenting a funding proposal (entrepreneurs) (Hisrich
and Jankowicz 1990).
Figure 2 shows the corresponding cluster analysis for venture
capitalist 1. The ‘tree-diagram’ at the right shows a link in the
respondent’s rational. Constructs connected along neighbouring ‘branches’
are closer together in the respondent’s mind than those connected along
non-adjacent branches. The scale shows the percentage similarity of
constructs, calculated from the respondent’s original ratings: follow any
pair of adjacent branches to the right until they meet, then, read up from
that point onto the scale. For example, there is a 95% match between
‘honesty and integrity’ and ‘character in general’ in this respondent’s
thinking (lines in bold). Whenever he says ‘honesty and integrity’, he also
says ‘character in general’, and vice-versa.
Cluster analysis for venture capitalists

Respondent 1 shows three principal clusters. That is, one sub-cluster
associates the importance of having a competitive strategy with the ability
to ‘make things happen’ or ‘bias for action’. A second sub-cluster consists
of the entrepreneur’s honesty, integrity and character in general as opposed
to not having a ‘reality orientation’. A third sub-cluster groups the
entrepreneur’s ability to assimilate new competitive information as well as
marketing core competencies.
Respondent 2 shows three highly matched (100%) clusters. As shown in
ﬁgure 3, the ﬁrst is a cluster grouping eight constructs. This reﬂects the
importance that this investor places on the entrepreneur’s ability to ‘think
out of the box’. Constructs in this cluster range from tenacity, commitment, innovativeness and conﬁdence to lack of pretentiousness of the
entrepreneur. A second cluster reﬂects the importance the investor places
on the desire of the entrepreneur to assimilate new knowledge as well as the
entrepreneur’s openness to opinions and help. A third cluster includes two
constructs dealing with the entrepreneur’s ability to recognize weaknesses
and ﬁll gaps in the team as well as the entrepreneur’s lack of arrogance
when recognizing the need to change his position in the future.
Respondent 3 shows a looser structure (ﬁgure 4). In other words, the
different constructs are utilized as rather independent ways of assessing a
proposal. One sub-cluster associates the ability for understanding the
market opportunity with the importance of assimilating new market
information as well as the market perceived as a ‘hot’ market or as a niche.
The entrepreneur’s business experience and past successes are somewhat
less closely related to other constructs and represent factors to which this
investor gives separate and distinct consideration.
Respondent 4 also shows a somewhat loose structure (ﬁgure 5). One
cluster associates three highly-matching constructs (96%). These constructs

<-----Page 15----->150

ENRIQUE DÍAZ DE LEÓN AND PAUL D. GUILD

relate to the responsibility of the entrepreneur as well as to openness to
listening and accountability to the board by way of corporate governance.
There are two constructs slightly related to this sub-cluster dealing with
realistic expectations of the entrepreneur and consistency in management
decisions. Qualiﬁed entrepreneurs with good operating procedures
constitute independent aspects of this investor’s decisions.
Respondent 5 shows two tight clusters (ﬁgure 6), one of which groups
two highly matched (100%) constructs related to the ability of the team to
overcome difﬁcult situations. These constructs are characterized by
‘surviving when something goes wrong’ and having a ‘full team in place’,
where, in contrast, ventures with an incomplete team are more vulnerable
to ‘falling apart’ when things do not happen as planned. This investor
seems to relate surviving with the corporate culture of the new venture as
well as the ‘team’s ability to make good decisions and learn from
[mistakes]’, also the ability to ‘reinvent their business model overnight’.
A second cluster includes another highly matched pair of constructs. These
constructs are characterized by the desire of a founder to succeed and his
motivation to make money, as opposed to the determination of founders
unwilling to relinquish the leadership of a new venture due to a feeling of
the venture being ‘their baby’. This cluster includes two somewhat looser
constructs related to the experience and know-how of the founder.
Cluster analysis for entrepreneurs

Respondent 1 shows a loose structure (ﬁgure 7). This entrepreneur
considers as an important factor of success the wisdom of the founder to
trust the management of the new venture to a more qualiﬁed manager. In
other words, this is the opposite of a founder who wants to control his
venture indeﬁnitely. The contrast is interesting, for the construct
corresponds to what several investors considered a very problematic
situation. One could argue that these constructs are part of the respondent’s
personal theory with respect to success of a new venture. In this case, he is
associating this issue with two highly related constructs: ‘founder has been
successful in the past’ and ‘founder is genuine’. Having a ‘robust and
adaptable management team’ and ‘passion’ are two additional constructs
that belong to this sub-cluster.
Respondent 2 shows a sub-cluster with three constructs (ﬁgure 8). One
deals with the ‘health’ of the investor. When asked to elaborate, the
entrepreneur explained this in terms of ‘being more intrusive/being less
intrusive’. Where an investor with ﬁnancial difﬁculties would be considered
more intrusive, therefore putting unnecessary pressure on the management
team. This interesting ﬁnding would not have surfaced had we considered
only investors in the study. It would seem to have important implications
for those entrepreneurs looking for ﬁnancing.
The construct dealing with ‘health’ of the investors is associated with
the strong technical grounding of the founder as well as a ‘strong instilled’
management team. On the other hand, ‘niche detection’ and the ability to
learn from customers constitute issues that indicate separate concern.

<-----Page 16----->INTANGIBLES IN BUSINESS PLANS

151

Respondent 3 shows one main cluster (ﬁgure 9). A group of six
constructs form a tight (96%) sub-cluster: a dynamic business plan
‘constantly evolving and changing’ and good credibility are related to the
ability to achieve milestones to ‘keep the money happy’ as well as to have
realistic expectations of ‘how much capital to raise’ and ‘when’. Moreover,
the team’s ‘ability to expand’ seems to be inﬂuenced its having a
collaborative management team. A group of ﬁve constructs dealing mainly
with the personality of the founder complements this cluster. Issues
associated with ‘business etiquette’ and ‘dynamic personality’ as well as
‘genuineness’ belong to this group of constructs.
Respondent 4 shows one tight cluster (ﬁgure 10). Integrity and honesty
are highly related to his concept of ‘being an entrepreneur’, also linked to a
‘potential to succeed’. Similarly, a ‘reasonable’ rather than an ‘incompetent’
management team is one with an ability to make ‘quick’ and ‘good’
management decisions. ‘Education of the founders’ is explained as ‘having
professional degrees’ and belongs to this cluster as well. ‘Strong technical
expertise’ and the ‘ability to assimilate new knowledge’ are constructs to
which this participant gives different consideration.
Respondent 5 provided a total of 19 constructs (ﬁgure 11) clustered in
two main groups. An ability to communicate the founder’s vision is
associated with an ability to ‘think outside the box’. Similarly, ‘being open
to advice and suggestions’ is linked not only to experience but also to
proactive reaction to new information as opposed to operating with ‘a
closed mind’, which is closely related to the ability to ‘work with people’. A
second group includes constructs associated with ‘inherent passion’,
‘dedication’, ‘clear vision’ and ‘handling a fast pace’. Somewhat linked to
this cluster are abilities to ‘ﬁll in the gaps in terms of weaknesses or
strengths’, ‘be operationally focused’, ‘have good drive’ and ‘be operationally organized’. Interestingly enough, team characteristics such as ‘being
creative and innovative’ as well as ‘being originators of the idea’ are issues
of separate concern to this entrepreneur. In general, these descriptions are
diverse with several distinct constructs in each case. In other words, while
investors and entrepreneurs draw on a fairly common set of constructs,
they associate them in different ways and form their impressions of a
venture proposal by focusing on different aspects.
Some constructs were represented as independent of the main clusters
and are worthy of separate analysis. A possible explanation of this
circumstance is the fact that some of the constructs are unique to each
venture and therefore should be assessed on an individual basis. One could
hypothesize, in other words, that when assessing a new venture proposal,
all investors and entrepreneurs look for the presence of certain characteristics (the founder’s experience and background, for example). At the same
time, there are idiosyncrasies particular to each venture. The conclusion
might be that, initially, investors are matching a venture proposal’s
characteristics against somewhat standard criteria.
After an evaluation of certain fundamentals, investors focus on the
particularities of such venture. One implication is that, in assessing a new
venture, a simple veriﬁcation of a list of criteria would probably result in
unrealistic understandings of its value. In other words, only a comprehen-

<-----Page 17----->152

ENRIQUE DÍAZ DE LEÓN AND PAUL D. GUILD

sive assessment process can produce a more realistic value for a new
venture proposal.
Principal component analysis
A principal component analysis provides a description of the connections
between elements and constructs in a grid. It reveals how a large number of
individual judgements made by the subject in rating all the elements on all
the constructs are manifestations of a relatively more simple underlying
structure. It also shows contrasts between the different elements (business
plans, in this case). These contrasts are indicated in terms of which
constructs are of major importance in the subject’s system.
The principal component analysis extracts successive components: the
ﬁrst being able to account for the most variation, the second accounting for
the most residual variation and so on. In most grids, the ﬁrst principal
component accounts for between 30% and 50% of total variance, the second
for 10% to 25% and subsequent components for diminishing proportions
(Ryle 1975). For most practical purposes, the ﬁrst two or three components
provide an adequate picture of the subject’s system (Bell, 1990).
Our interest in analysing principal components is to obtain an indication
of the cognitive complexity that investors and entrepreneurs use when
assessing proposals. Cognitive complexity can be summarized in terms of
the differences in which subjects construe the same issues independently of
each other (Adams-Webber 1996). For example, a highly complex
individual will take into account markedly different aspects of an issue
when thinking about it, as opposed to viewing it in terms of the one or two
themes dominating his thinking. As described by Adams-Webber (1970),
the proportion of total variance accounted for by the largest factor or ﬁrst
principal component provides an index of the cognitive complexity. A
useful rule of thumb in repertory grid work is to regard a situation in which
60% or more of variance is accounted for by the ﬁrst principal component as
an indication of low cognitive complexity (Smith and Stewart 1977, Smith
1980).
Table 2 provides a summary of separate principal component analyses of
each individual grid. The results of these analyses indicate that all
respondents show a relatively low complexity with just one or two themes
representing their thinking. After analysing each grid, we labelled the
themes corresponding to each participant. Those labels were taken from
the nearest two constructs to the ﬁrst principal component axis. Table 3
shows a summary of these labels for the ﬁrst principal components.
A perusal of table 3 shows that the preponderant themes (from both
investors and entrepreneurs) relate to the adequacy of the management
team with the business proposal. Associating the two main constructs from
each ﬁrst component with their groups (described in table 1) corroborated
this result. We found that most of the two main constructs belong to groups
two and ﬁve (personality of the entrepreneur and business proposal
respectively). In this area, our results correspond to those reported by
Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990).

this example, the ﬁrst two principal components account for 97% of the
variance.
Analysis of extremity
Several studies have deﬁned rating extremity as an indication of
personal meaningfulness (Shepherd 1999). For example, Bonarius
(1970) has shown that subjects rate their close associates (e.g. best
friend) more extremely than remote acquaintances (e.g. doctor). There is
also considerable evidence, reviewed by Adams-Webber (1979), that
subjects tend to rate themselves and others more extremely on elicited
constructs than on supplied ones. Moreover, as discussed by AdamsWebber and Benjaﬁeld (1973), rating extremity also correlates with
personal judgements of the relative meaningfulness of supplied
constructs. It has been agreed that the higher the extremity score, the
more meaningful the statement is for the respondent. In other words, an
extremity score indicates how far a respondent rated the elements from
the midpoint of a scale. Rating extremity is then calculated by
subtracting the midpoint of a scale from each assigned rating. In our
case we used a scale of 1 to 5 with a midpoint of 3. For example,
a rating of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 would have an extremity score of
|1 – 3| = 2. The resulting extremity scores for each element (business
plans in our study) are added up and divided by the number of plans
rated (in this study, there were six). Table 4 provides a summary of the
two higher extremity scores for each participant. The last column shows
a checkmark (3) indicating those constructs that not only have the most
extreme values but also correspond to the top two highest weights from
the principal component. These constructs contribute two characteristics. First, they are meaningful to the participant. Second, by knowing
their loading, we can predict the participant’s ratings with large
accuracy (see table 2 to conﬁrm the variance accounted for by the ﬁrst
component of each grid).

Conclusion
This study on venture capital and entrepreneurship has important
implications for both practitioners and researchers. A major ﬁnding is
the high relevance of intangibles in the assessment of business plans from
technology-based ventures. This study also provides venture capitalists
with an insight into the important role played by intangibles and intuition
during their due diligence process. Another important implication of this

<-----Page 21----->156

ENRIQUE DÍAZ DE LEÓN AND PAUL D. GUILD

study for venture capitalists is the articulation of more relevant questions
pertaining to intangibles that can be used during the screening stage of
their decision making process. Additionally, the experts in this study
elicited a set of intangibles that could be used by venture capitalists. For
example, practitioners could focus their attention on those intangibles in
order to increase the efﬁciency of the screening stage. The results of this
study could be considered an important milestone in understanding such
intriguing quests: to increase the predictive validity of success from a
business opportunity and the elaboration of an ‘ideal’ business plan.
The news media and business publications frequently publicize
individual experiences shared by entrepreneurs. Such stories may create
an unrealistic expectation in terms of the availability of large amounts of
venture capital, the relative ease to raise capital, and entrepreneurship as a
ticket to success. However, the reality is that entrepreneurs often have
difﬁculty raising capital. For example, venture capitalists claim that there
are very few deals in which they wish to invest; there is limited amount of
capital available for new ventures at early stages; and there are more failures
than successes of technology-based new ventures. Perhaps an explanation
of this phenomenon is the intangible nature of most of such investment
opportunities. This study offers an empirical ﬁrst look at the assessment of
intangibles in technology-based new ventures.
The results of this study not only provide evidence of the effectiveness
of using repertory grids to elicit intangibles but also increase our knowledge
of the venture capital decision process. We used an innovative approach
considering two perspectives—the investor and the entrepreneur’s—into
this decision-making problem. Thus, we gained new appreciation of the
elements in a subjective evaluation of early stage technology based
ventures.
Furthermore, the outcome of the FOCUS-based cluster analysis
provides additional evidence of individual differences among venture
capitalists with respect to their cognitive complexity in terms of their
evaluations of entrepreneurs, which supplements that derived from the
principal component analysis. Moreover, while investors and entrepreneurs
draw on a fairly large set of constructs, they associate them in different
ways and form their impressions of a venture proposal by focusing on a
variety of aspects. This is a result of major signiﬁcance. In other words, it
very effectively illustrates the fundamental importance of personally
constructed knowledge in the development of high-level expertise.
The results of this study show a similarity in the way investors and
entrepreneurs construe investment proposals. For example, an analysis of
the constructs from each group reveals that both place high importance on
the perceived qualiﬁcations of the management team. This category
considers not only the skills of the management team but also their core
competencies, abilities, and business acumen. Constructs related to the
personality of the entrepreneur—honesty, integrity, passion and business
etiquette, for example—are also included.
Some of our results replicate the ﬁndings of Hisrich and Jankowicz
(1990) in which management was regarded as the most important category.
Furthermore, using this rather new technique, we provide a scientiﬁc proof

<-----Page 22----->INTANGIBLES IN BUSINESS PLANS

157

of otherwise anecdotal evidence with regards to intangibles in investment of
technology-based ventures. For example, the investors’ frequent mention
of honesty conﬁrms how important this intangible is, just as ‘good business
etiquette’ seemed to be decisive for some investors. When asked for an
elaboration of such construct, one investor stated, ‘if the entrepreneur
doesn’t show any courtesy with us as partners, how could we expect that
they will respect and anticipate their customers’ needs?’
The ﬁndings of this study are not fully consistent with research by Hall
and Hofer (1993). Their main point was that venture capitalists are not
concerned with the assessment of human capital when screening new
investment proposals. Perhaps their ﬁndings were due to the design of their
study, which determined only the earliest phase of deal screening. This is
where venture capitalists are sifting through hundreds of proposals by
target company managers. One possible assessment method used by
investors at this time is to screen opportunities by comparing the new
proposal’s characteristics against general working guidelines, such as area
of investment, geographic location, and stage of the venture. By the time
the investors move to the in-depth due diligence research phase, it is very
clear from the results of this study that venture capitalists are concerned
with an effective assessment of some of the intangibles involved in the
proposal.
Another interesting ﬁnding of this study, although mentioned only once
by an entrepreneur, is the construct related to the ‘health of the venture
capitalist’. We think this is worth mentioning since this study, different
from others, includes a consideration of the point of view of the
entrepreneur. A further explanation of this construct detailed how a
‘healthy’ investor is one without ﬁnancial troubles. According to this
entrepreneur, a venture capitalist struggling with ﬁnancial difﬁculties is
‘more intrusive’ and puts ‘unnecessary pressure’ on the management team.
Finally, these ﬁndings cause us to reconsider our earlier efforts to locate
a set of fully generalized ‘intangibles’. We better understand the contextual
idiosyncratic and dynamic nature of these important attributes.
Future research
Future studies could make a contribution by focusing a microscope on early
stages of new technology-based ventures at various points. In other words,
a longitudinal study could provide evidence of the dynamism as well as the
idiosyncratic characteristics of a new venture. That is, technology-based
ventures not only experience constant change but also need to overcome
this change in order to survive. This situation is even more critical for new
ventures. Therefore, having a list of criteria to appraise the value of these
ventures at only one point in time would probably result in an unrealistic
assessment. Thus, our results show that an assessment process is probably
more appropriate than a one-time assessment. We need, then, a method to
assess a new venture over different points in time.
Our investigation suggests that a longitudinal study should consist of
eliciting impressions and signiﬁcance of a new venture from a group of

entrepreneurs, incubators and venture capitalists at three points. The ﬁrst
occurs when an idea is initially presented to an investor and, curiously,
interest is piqued. The second comes when the entrepreneur presents the
idea in the form of a business plan to an incubator. The third takes place
when the new venture is ready for its ﬁrst round of ﬁnancing, usually from
a venture capitalist. The longitudinal study allows us to consider three
angles of the same problem: (1) the ideas, which usually come from an
entrepreneur; (2) the management, which is usually provided by
incubators; and (3) the capital, which usually comes from a venture
capitalist.
