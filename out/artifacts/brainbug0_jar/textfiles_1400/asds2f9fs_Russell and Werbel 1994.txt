Work values were examined as an antecedent of recruiters’ judgments
of applicant fit with the organization. Data were collected on the
work values of recruiters, their organizations, and job applicants in actual job interviews conducted through the placement center of a large
university. Following the interviews, recruiters evaluated applicants’
general employability and organization-specific fit. Approximately 4
months following the interviews, data on whether the applicants were
invited for a second interview were also obtained. Work value congruence between the applicant and the recruiter was found to be related to judgments of general employability and organization-specific
fit. Congruence between the applicant and the organization (as perceived by the recruiter) was not related to judgments of employability
and organization-specific fit. Recruiter ratings of employability were
related to the decision to invite the applicant for a second interview.
Work value congruence was not related to second interview decisions.
It is concluded that if work values and judgments of applicant fit influence the personnel selection process, they are more likely to do so
at later stages when job offer decisions are made. Work values and
judgments of applicant fit seem to have minimal impact on decisions
to retain the applicant for additional consideration in early stages of
the selection process.

The personnel selection literature has traditionally focused on
person-job fit (P-J fit), defined as the individual having the necessary
knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to perform the job (e.g., Hedge &
Teachout, 1992; O’Reilly, Caldwell, & Mirable, 1992). Personorganization fit (P-0 fit) extends both the predictor and criterion
domains to broadly define fit as congruence of the personality traits,

beliefs, and values of the employee with the culture, strategic needs,
norms, andvalues of the organization (Bowen, Ledford, &Nathan, 1991;
Bretz, Ash, & Dreher, 1989; Rynes & Gerhart, 1990).
Despite the increasing focus on P-0 fit in the selection literature,
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) noted that components of fit have not been
precisely delineated or empirically tested. There is no agreed upon conceptual definition of P-0 fit or evidence that it contributes to personnel
selection decisions. Rynes and Gerhart found definitions referring to
congruence in “personal values, political orientation, hobbies, personality traits, attire, physical characteristics, use of leisure time, and even
eating habits” that go beyond “assessments of ‘general employability’for
any organization or. . .idiosyncratic reactions of individual evaluators”
(p. 15). Regardless of the lack of a conceptual definition of P-0 fit, evidence suggests recruiters do make judgments of P-0fit that are distinct
from judgments of how “employable” an applicant is (Rynes & Gerhart,
1990). Recruiters’ initial judgments constitute the first gate applicants
must pass through in the selection process. Recruiter judgments of P-0
fit and employabilitymay affect the utility of subsequentselection procedures (see Boudreau & Rynes, 1985, for a description of how recruiting
impacts SD, in the Brogden-Cronbach-Glesermodel of utility).
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) called for future research to “pursue additional construct definition and validation” (p. 29) of factors that enter
into assessments of P-0 fit. Work values may be one important aspect
of P-0 fit that impacts recruiter judgments. Schein (1985) argued that
functions necessary to the survival of the organization are enhanced by
employees sharing core organizational values. P-0 fit defined as congruent work values has been found to be related to job satisfaction, organizational commitment, reporting to work on time, and intention to
remain with the organization (e.g., Chatman, 1991; Meglino, Ravlin, &
Adkins, 1989).
The primary purpose of the current study was to determine whether
congruence between applicants’ work values and those of the organization contribute to recruiters’ judgments of P-0 fit. We briefly review
findings related to P-0 fit in selection and workvalue congruence before
presenting the specific hypotheses addressed.

P-0Fit in Selection
The most promising study of P-0 fit in the selection process to date
is that of Rynes and Gerhart (1990). They argued that judgments of
fit were most salient to the firm after candidates had been minimally
prescreened on requisite KSAs and were most commonly assessed in
employment interviews.

Unfortunately, as noted by Rynes and Gerhart (1990), prior interview research tended to use measures which confound recruiter impressions of general employability (e.g., “common stereotypes applied
widely across interviewers and firms”; Rynes & Gerhart, 1990, p. 16),
P-0 fit, and interviewer-specificidiosyncratic variance (e.g., similar-tome bias, etc.). Rynes and Gerhart carried out the only empirical attempt
to partition variance in recruiter impressions into these three components. They reported evidence bearing on whether (a) recruiter ratings of person-organization fit contain anything more than idiosyncratic
recruiter preferences and (b) a distinction existed between ratings of
person-organization fit and general employability. To explore these issues they obtained single-item measures of general employability and
P-0 fit from initial interviews conducted by recruiters visiting a large
business school.
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) reported that when multiple recruiters
from the same firm evaluated P-0 fit, interrater reliability was greater
(.49) than for recruiters from different firms (.20), while the difference
was much smaller (.33 vs. .24) for interrater reliability of general employability. They inferred from this “that interviewers from the same
organization share at least some [italics added] common notions about
firm-specific employability or applicant fit” (p. 23). Thus, recruiters do
make conceptually distinct judgments of P-0 fit.
Ryan and Schmit (1993) examined the relationship of fit between
individual and organizational characteristics to selection, performance,
and turnover. Using a small sample of applicants for the position of insurance claims adjuster, they found that there was no significant difference in fit between those who were hired and those who were not hired.
In follow-up analyses, however, they found that the P - 0 fit of individuals
who remained with the organization was higher than for individualswho
left the organization. Using other samples, they found that P-0 fit was
significantly correlated with supervisory ratings of performance. Thus,
P-0 fit was not found to be related to selection decisions, but was related
to performance and to the individual remaining with the organization.

Work Value Congruence
Work values have been examined as a component of P - 0 fit in contexts other than personnel selection. Chatman (1991) examined the role
of P-0 fit, operationalized as congruence between the work values of
the employee and the dominant workvalues of the organization, in newcomer’s adjustment to the organization,job satisfaction, and intent to remain with the organization. Congruence was assessed using a 54-item Qsort instrument developed by O’Reilly, Chatman, and Caldwell (1991).

<-----Page 3----->608

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Individuals with high person-organization work value congruence adjusted to the organization more quickly, were more satisfied, and intended to remain with the organization longer than those with low work
value congruence. Although Chatman (1991) reported that the amount
of time the newcomer spent with representatives of the organization before being hired was associated with P-0 fit, she did not examine relations between the Q-sort measure of workvalue congruence and existing
recruiting and selection procedures.
Meglino et al. (1989) examined fit on the dimension of work value
congruence between supervisors and subordinates. Congruence between employees’ work values and those of their supervisors was associated with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and reporting
to work on time. Value congruence was assessed using the Comparative Emphasis Scale (CES; Ravlin & Meglino, 1987a, 198%; Meglino,
Ravlin, & Adkins, 1989, 1992). The CES is a 24-item forced-choice instrument yielding ipsative rankings of the four work values of achievement, fairness, honesty, and helping and concern. The CES is substantially less cumbersome to administer and evaluate than the Q-sort procedure.
Similarly, Adkins, Ravlin, and Meglino (1992) examined fit on the
dimension of work value congruence between co-workers. Value congruence was again assessed using the CES. They found that the extent to
which the job required the individual to work closely with others moderated the relationship between work value congruence and performance.
The relationship between work value congruence and facet satisfactions
and attendance was moderated by the individual’s tenure with the organization.
Finally, Judge and Bretz (1992) used the CES values instrument to
examine relationships between work value congruence and job choice.
They asked college graduates to complete the CES and then provided
job scenarios incorporating the values of the CES. Individuals tended to
prefer jobs with dominant work values consistent with their own.
Thus, one proposed facet of the construct domain underlying P-0 fit,
work value congruence, has been shown to be related to important organizational and individual outcomes including individuals’ preference
for jobs. Given these promising findings in the broader context of management and organizational behavior, it would interesting to determine
whether this nomological network of relations extends to include aspects
of personnel selection processes. Specifically, the present study examined whether one hypothesized aspect of the P-0 fit construct (work
value congruence) is related to recruiter judgments of P-0 fit, recruiter
judgments of employability, and firms’ subsequent invitations for second interviews. Evidence of such relationships would simultaneously

confirm (a) the importance of work value congruence as a facet of the
P-0 fit construct and (b) the theoretical and practical contribution of
P-0 fit for personnel selection systems.
Recruiters from multiple organizations assessed the general employability and P-0 fit of applicants during actual campus interviews. The
Ravlin and Meglino (1987a, 1987b, 1989) CES instrument has already
been shown by Judge and Bretz (1992) to predict one side of the personnel selection process-applicant job choice decisions. Hence, we used
the CES in conjunction with a multi-item measure of recruiters’ perceptions of P-0 fit and general employability. We also obtained a CESbased measure of value congruence between the candidate and the recruiter, and a “selection process” criterion measure of whether the candidate was asked to come back for a second interview.
Our first hypothesis, replicating Rynes and Gerhart (1990), tested
whether recruiter perceptions of P-0 fit are distinct from perceptions of
general employability. Our second hypothesis tested whether recruiter
perceptions of P-0fit are best explained by congruence between the
work values of the applicant and organization (as perceived by the recruiter) or are best explained by congruence between the work values
of the applicant and the recruiter (what Rynes and Gerhart called an idiosyncratic effect). In an exploratory analysis, we also examined whether
one of the 24 possible orders of four work values might constitute a
“u n i~ er s al,cross-organizational
~~
hierarchy of work values against which
applicant values are c0mpared.l Our third hypothesis tested how well
the measures of work value congruence (applicant-organization and
applicant-recruiter), general employability, and recruiter judgments of
P-0 fit were related to a subsequent selection system outcome (decisions
to invite the candidate back for a second interview).
Method
Participants
Participants for the present study were corporate recruiters interviewing through the placement center of a large state university and the
job applicants they interviewed. Corporate recruiters were contacted in
advance of their campus visits to solicit participation in the study. Fiftytwo (95%) of the companies contacted agreed to participate. Of those,
44 recruiters (31 male, 13 female) from 37 companies returned usable
pre- and post-interview surveys. Seventeen of the recruiters (42.8% of
‘We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting the possibility of a “universal” order
of work values.

<-----Page 5----->610

PERSONNELPSYCHOLOGY

the interviews) were human resource managers, while the remaining 26
were functional managers (the job title of one was missing). As in the
Rynes and Gerhart (1990) study, the unit of analysis in this study was
the interview; therefore, recruiters interviewed multiple candidates and
some applicants had multiple interviews. Recruiters conducted an average of 8 interviews each (range 2 to 21).
Of the 534 interviews conducted, applicant surveys were completed
for 353 (66%). The 353 interviews were conducted on 171 applicants,
hence the range of independent candidate “stimuli” was restricted, causing any observed effects to conservativelyestimate what would have been
observed if 353 independent candidate “stimuli” had been available. Of
these, 56 (30%) were female, and 32 (15%) were nonwhite. Complete
information (questionnaires and archival data) was obtained on 310 of
the 353 interviews (88%).
Procedure
Recruiters completed two separate CES questionnaires assessing
their personal work values and their perceptions of their corporations’
work values anywhere from 2 months in advance of the campus interviews to the day of the campus interviews. Immediately after the interviews, they rated each candidate on general employability and P-0
fit. Recruiters were contacted approximately 4 months after their campus recruiting dates and asked to indicate which candidates had been invited for a second interview. A total of 243 of the 353 interviews (69%)
provided information on all questionnaire measures and on whether
candidates were invited back for second interviews (the rest did not
have the positions open that they had originally anticipated). Recruiters
were informed that all information gathered was confidential and were
promised a report of the results of the study.
Applicant participation was solicited by approaching applicants as
they signed up for an interview time or as they arrived for the interview.
Job applicants completed a survey and were informed that all respon,ses
were confidential and that participation in the study would not affect
their job interview in any way. Applicant demographic, work history,
and academic data were gathered from placement records.
Measures
Recruiter and organizationvalues. The instrument was designed to assess (a) the recruiters’ personal work values and (b) recruiters’
perceptions of the organization’s work values using the Comparative
Emphasis Scale (CES; Ravlin & Meglino, 1987a, 1987b). The CES

<-----Page 6----->CHERYL L. ADKINS ET AL.

61 1

measures the four work values of achievement, fairness, honesty, and
helping and concern for others. These values were selected based on surveys of 966 employees at different levels in a variety of organizations (see
Cornelius, Ullman, Meglino, Czajka, & McNeely, 1985). The CES is a
forced-choice measure which yields a purely ipsative rank-ordering of
the workvalues (see Hicks, 1970). Respondents are asked to choose between behaviors representing each of the four work values. Each value is
paired with every other value four times for a total of 24 items. Because
values are arranged hierarchically in value systems (Locke, 1976, 1982;
Ravlin & Meglino, 1989; Rokeach, 1973), use of an ipsative measure is
appropriate. Further, this measurement approach controls for the social
desirability of values (Fallding, 1965; Ravlin & Meglino, 1987a, 198%).
More detailed descriptions of CES item development and construct validity are presented by Judge and Bretz (1992), Meglino et al. (1989,
1992) and Ravlin and Meglino (1987a, 1987b, 1989).
Recruiters were asked to complete the first CES instrument in a way
that reflected the behaviors that they personally felt were important on
the job. They were then asked to complete the second CES instrument
in a way that reflected the behaviors they believed their organization
as a whole viewed as important. Because we were examining whether
recruiters based judgments of P-0 fit on similaritywith the organization
versus similaritywith their own personal work values, the recruiters’perception of the organization’swork values is the appropriate operationalization.
Assessment of applicant. Recruiters assessed applicants’ (a) general
employability and (b) P-0 fit using a 6-item instrument. Conceptually,
these were expected to be highly correlated, but independent, constructs.
Specifically, while conceptually every possible combination of higMow
employability and higMow P-0 fit is possible, we expected that most
individuals who were rated as high P-0 fit would also be rated high on
employability, and most individuals rated as low P-0 fit would be likely to
rated low on employability. If true, this would yield a positive correlation
between P-0 fit and employability ratings.
Two items measured P-0 fit (alpha = .96). These itemswere: “Given
your overall impression of this candidate, how good a ‘fit’ do you think
there is between the candidate and your organization?” and “DOyou
think other people in your organization will think this candidate fits well
in the organization?” Both items were scored on a 7-point response scale
(1 = “Poor fit”; 7 = “Good fit”).
Four items measured general employability (alpha = .91). These
items were: “Given your overall impression of this candidate, how ‘employable’ do you think this candidate is (i.e., how likely do you think this
candidate is to receive other job offers)?” “Do you think other people

<-----Page 7----->612

PERSONNELPSYCHOLOGY

in your organization will feel this candidate is very employable (will receive many job offers)?” “Regardless of the candidate’s qualifications,
how likeable was this candidate?” and “DOyou think other people in
your organization will find this candidate likeable?” These items were
also scored on a 7-point response scale (1 = “Low employability”; 7 =
“High employability”).
Applicant values and characteristics. Job applicants were asked to
complete the CES in a way that reflected their personal work values.
It was also felt that differences in applicants’ interpersonal skills might
affect the extent to which they communicate their work values to the recruiter, influencing recruiters’ judgments of general employability and
P-0 fit. Consequently, applicants were asked to complete the behavioral
friendship subscale of the effective interpersonal behavior scale developed by Ford and his colleagues (Ford, Burt, & Bergin, 1984; Ford & Tisak, 1983). Five items asked candidates to describe how well they do in
different interpersonal situations at work. Russell (1987) demonstrated
that effective interpersonal behavior scale scores were related to ratings
of oral communication skills in an assessmentcenter setting (he reported
items from all subscales in an appendix). The coefficient alpha for this
scale was .81.
Archival information. Demographic data, work history, GPA, and
self-report information on student’s involvement in campus activities
were gathered from placement records. These data included gender
(coded 0 = female; 1 = male), whether the applicant was a member of a
minority group (coded 0 = minority group member Asian, black, or Hispanic; 1 = Caucasian), the applicant’s grade point average, the number
of jobs the applicant had held, and the number of campus activities the
applicant was involved in. Dougherty, Turban, and Forret (1993) found
that GPA and participation in extracurricular activities were related to
recruiter judgments of applicant employability.
Approximately 4 months after the campus visits, recruiters were contacted and asked to indicate which applicants were invited for a second
interview. Twenty-five firms provided information on inviting recruits
for second interviews. Eight of the organizations were not hiring due to
economic conditions and were not included in analyses using presence
or absence of a second interview as a dependent variable.
Assessment of Wlue Congruence

As noted above, the CES yields a fully ipsative ranking of the four
work values of achievement, honesty, fairness, and helping and concern for others. Because of the ipsative nature of this measure, the use
of traditional parametric statistical procedures is inappropriate (Hicks,

<-----Page 8----->CHERYL L. ADKINS ET AL.

613

1970). Therefore, congruence between the recruiter’s personal work
values and the applicant’s work values was operationalized by computing a rank order correlation between the applicant’s ranking of the four
work values and the recruiter’s personal work value rankings. This
index is subsequently referred to as “applicant-recruiter work value
congruence.” Similar profiles have exhibited substantial construct and
criterion-related validity in non-selection settings (e.g., Meglino et al.,
1989,1992).
A second rank-order correlation was also estimated between recruiter’s ranking of the organization’s work values and applicant’svalue
ranking. This index will subsequently be referred to as “applicantorganization value congruence.” Finally, in an exploratory analysis, a
third set of rank-order correlations was derived between the applicants’
ranking of work values and each of the 24 possible rank orders of work
values. If one of these sequences of values is “universal” or crossorganizational, “applicant-universal” value congruence should predict
ratings of employability and P-0 fit. All resulting correlations were then
converted to r-scores using the Fisher z transformation. This procedure
corrects for the skewness in the distribution of the rank-order correlations resulting from correlating the two profiles of four values each. This
distribution of correlations may be highly skewed due to ceiling and floor
effects (e.g., the correlations can only range from -1 to 1). For examples of the use of this procedure see Meglino et al. (1989,1992),Adkins,
Ravlin, and Meglino, (1992), and Adkins (1992).
Analyses
Following Rynes and Gerhart (1990)’ t-tests were computed comparing mean ratings on the two scales to examine whether recruiter perceptions of P-0 fit were distinct from perceptions of general employability. As per Rynes and Gerhart, average ratings of employability were
expected to be greater than average ratings of P-0 fit. Additionally, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to determine whether a twofactor solution was most consistent with correlations among the four
employability and two P-0 fit items. Multiple regression analysis was
used to test the relationship of value congruence to recruiter’s assessments of general employability and P - 0 fit. Independent variables included indices of (a) the congruence between applicants’ work values
and recruiters’ perceptions of the organization’s work values, (b) the
congruence between applicants’ and recruiters’ personal work values,
and (c) the congruence between applicant work values and a “universal”
set of work values. Dependent variables included recruiter’s ratings of
(a) candidate employability and (b) P - 0 fit. Traditional predictors of

<-----Page 9----->614

PERSONNELPSYCHOLOGY

employability (GPA, employment history, involvement in campus activities), sex, minority group membership, and behavioral social skills served
as control variables. Because there were three distinctly different categories of employers, we also controlled for type of industry (business,
engineering, or civil service- coded 1,0 for business; 0,l for engineering; and 0,O for civil service). In each sequence of multiple regression
analyses, the dependent variable of interest was regressed on the control
variables and the appropriate value congruence index. The significance
of the standardized regression coefficient for the work value congruence
index reflects its contribution to recruiter assessments of employability
and fit in the presence of other predictors.
As noted above, it is also possible that applicant social skills determine the accuracy, quantity, and nature of information exchanged in the
interview, hence moderating the relationship between measures of work
value congruence (obtained before the interview) and recruiters’ ratings of P-0 fit and employability (obtained from the interview). Consequently, interactions between the social skills scale and work value congruence measures were examined using moderated regression analysis.

Results
Our first hypothesis asked whether recruiter perceptions of general
employability and P-0 fit differ. Assessment of P-0 fit was significantly
lower than assessment of general employability (means 4.72 and 5.26,
respectively, t = - 12.66, p < .Ol), replicating the efforts of Rynes and
Gerhart (1990). When the coefficients of variation were compared (i.e.,
the standard deviatiodmeanx 100) the ratings of firm-specific fit were
significantlymore variable than those of general employability (s2 = 1.39
and 1.05, C.Vs = 29.40 and 20.02, respectively, F352,362 = 1.73, p <
.OOl). Confirmatory factor analysis forcing the four employability items
and two P-0fit items onto separate factors using LISREL VIII resulted
in the “best” fit of a11 modefs (inchding a single-factor model) when the
employability and P-0 fit factors were permitted to correlate (Goodness
of Fit Index = .939, Normed Fit Index = .901, with the employabilityP-0 fit correlation = .848). Thus, it appears that the current recruiters
make a distinction between P-0 fit and general employability, consistent
with findings reported by Rynes and Gerhart (1990).
Results reported in Table 1 contain the means, standard deviations,
and simple correlations among all variables. Applicant-recruiter work
value congruence was significantly correlated with P-0 fit ratings, but
not with employability ratings. Applicant-organization work value congruence was uncorrelated with any dependent variable. Only one rank

and 4-fairness) was correlated with both P-0 fit and employability (row
11in Table 1,labeled Value congruence “universal”). Table 2 shows that
applicant-recruiter work value congruence and candidate congruence
with the “universal” work value sequence were significant predictors of
recruiters’ ratings of P-0 fit and employability ratings after controlling
for demographic and academic predictors, increasing the multiple correlation by approximately 33% in each case. Consistent with the nonsignificant simple correlations in Table 1, applicant-organization work
value congruence did not significantlypredict ratings of employability or
P-0fit after controlling for demographic and academic predictors. This
suggests that recruiters’ judgments of P - 0 fit are best explained by either applicant-recruiter work value congruence or applicant-“universal”
work value congruence.
Finally, moderated regression analyses failed to yield significant interaction effects between the behavioral social skills scale and value congruence measures in predicting ratings of employability or P-0 fit. This
suggests that social skills (sensitivity to interpersonal cues, responding
appropriately to social cues, etc.) are not acting as a barrier in the communication and perception of work values in initial campus job interviews. Interestingly, the social skills scale did yield significant simple
correlations of recruiter ratings of P-0 fit and employability, suggesting
social skills are important in the initial interview, though not moderating

how applicant work values are conveyed. It should be noted that given
the relatively small statistical effect size associated with value congruence, our sample size may have been too small to detect an interaction
effect (Russell & Bobko, 1992).
Multiple regressions were also used to test the third hypothesis that
assessments of fit, employability, and work value congruence were related to the selection system outcome of inviting the candidate for a second interview. First, invitation for a second interview (coded 0 = ‘‘IIO;~~
1 = “yes”) was regressed onto the demographic and academic control
variables (i.e., industry, GPA, sex, race, number of previous jobs, number of campus activities, and the social skills scale), applicant-recruiter
value congruence, and applicant-“universal” value congruence. The
latter two variables were included due to their significant relationships
with P-0 fit and employability. General employability and P-0 fit were
added to the set of independent variables in a second step. Findings reported in Table 3 show that ratings of employability and P-0 fit were significant predictors of invitation for a second interview after controlling
for predictors of employability (AR = ,201, F2,210 = 21.20, p < .OOl).
In separate analyses it was found that applicant-organization work value
congruence was not related to invitations for a second interview.

regression. However, because it was desirable to examine sequential
contributions to prediction, the results of ordinary least squares regression analysis are presented here.

Discussion
The results substantiallyreplicate and extend earlier findings regarding the nature of recruiters’ ratings of P-0 fit and employability. Specifically, results bearing on our first hypothesis suggest recruiters in the
current study distinguished between judgments of candidates’ employability and P-0 fit. Differences in means and standard deviations of these
judgments suggest recruiters from different organizations show less variability about general employability than P-0 fit. Confirmatory factor
analysis also yields a best fitting model depicting two distinct, highly correlated constructs. Rynes and Gerhart (1990) reported similar results
using single-item measures, suggesting that recruiters from different organizations (a) have some shared perception of what it takes to get a job
in the labor market while (b) not sharing the same perceptions concerning how that employability “fits” with their firms’ needs. However, it
should be noted that given the high mean ratings of employability (5.26
on a 7-point scale), “ceiling effects” may attenuate the variance of this
construct.
Our second hypothesis tested whether work value congruence was
related to recruiters’ judgments of employability and P-0 fit. Applicantorganization work value congruence was not related to recruiters’ judgments of employability or P-0 fit. An initial interpretation of this finding
suggests that recruiter judgments of P-0 fit may be based on something
other than complementary work values between the candidate and the
organization. For example, work values other than the four reflected in
the CES may dictate recruiter judgments of P-0 fit and employability
(e.g., work values measured by the O’Reilly et al., 1991, Q-sort procedure); however, as noted previously, the four values represented in the
&S were selected from an extensive study of the values of 966 workers
from over 40 organizations throughout the United States. Further, the
values measured by the CES have been shown to be related to work outcomes in other settings (e.g., Adkins et al., 1992; Judge & Bretz, 1992;
Meglino et al., 1989).
Applicant-recruiter work value congruence and applicant“universal” work value congruence significantly contributed to the prediction of recruiters’ employability and P-0 fit ratings. Hence, while
the current results concur with the conclusion that recruiters distinguish
between judgments of general employability and “fit,” they also suggest
that recruiter judgments of employability and P-0 fit are driven by either

<-----Page 14----->CHERYL L.ADKINS ET AL.

619

(a) idiosyncratic fit (or what might be called a “similar-to-me” bias) or
(b) “universal” fit (or what might be called a “similar-to-an-ideal” bias).
An average rank correlation of r = S O between recruiters’ work values
and the “universal” work values suggests that different comparisons result when applicant work values are compared to those of a recruiter
versus some ideal hierarchy.
A post hoc analysis examined the relationship between applicantrecruiter value congruence, applicant-“universal” value congruence,
and the dependent variables of employability and P-0 fit. As with previous analyses, demographic variables were entered in the first step, and
applicant-recruiter value congruence and applicant-“universal” value
congruence were entered together in the second step. Applicantrecruiter value congruence and applicant-“universal” value congruence
together were significant predictors of employability and P-0 fit ( A R 2
= .02, F2,308 = 3.16, p < .05; A R 2 = .03, F2,308 = 4.93, p < .01,
respectively). Further, the regression weights for applicant-recruiter
value congruence and applicant-“universal” value congruence were significant in both equations (all at p < .05, one-tailed), suggesting that
some combination of fit with an individual recruiter and with a “universal” value ranking predicts judgments of fit.2 Thus, it appears that
judgments of employability and P-0 fit have multiple antecedents. It is
interesting to note that the “universal” value ranking (1-achievement,
2-honesty, 3-concern, 4-fairness) emphasizes the more performanceoriented value of achievement over the more people-oriented values of
concern and fairness. Further, when applicant values are compared with
the “universal” value ranking, they are being compared to a fixed value
hierarchy as opposed to being compared to the different value rankhgs
of individual recruiters and organizations. Thus, applicant-“universal”
value congruence should be viewed as a pure individual difference measure. Applicant-organization and applicant-recruiter value congruence
will contain aspects of both applicant individual differences and situational circumstances (organization and recruiter values). Therefore,
these findings suggest, not surprisingly, that applicants who are higher
in the value of achievement are judged to be more employable and to fit
better with the organization. It must be noted, however, that analyses examining “universal”va1ueswere post hoc and exploratory in nature. Before generalizing to other samples, it is essential to cross-validate these
findings.
Interestingly, recruiters’ personal rankings of work values are also
significantly related to their perceptions of the organizations’ rankings
of work related values ( T = .758, p < .005). However, anything other

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

than a perfect correlation between organizational or “universal” work
values and recruiters’ personal work values permits the possibility of
recruiters arriving at conclusions based on idiosyncratic fit. For example, if recruiter-candidate value congruence was correlated .758 with
organization-candidate value congruence, and organization-candidate
value congruence was correlated .758 with recruiter ratings of P-0 fit,
then P-0 fit and recruiter-candidate value congruence can be correlated
anywhere from .150 to 1.00 (McNemar, 1962). As noted previously, recruiter perceptions of their organizations’ values is the construct of interest here; however, it is likely that recruiter values are highly congruent with those of their organization. Employers would not be expected
to send out recruiters whose work values are substantially deviant from
the rest of the organization. However, prior research in the area of corporate culture suggests that different subgroups (clans) within the organization can differ meaningfully in underlying values, norms, and beliefs (Ouchi, 1980; Wilkins & Ouchi, 1983). Clearly, further research
is needed to explore the underlying nuances in construct and criterionrelated validities associated with applicant-organization and applicantrecruiter value congruence.
The idiosyncraticfit interpretation is consistent with the findingbearing on our third hypothesis, that invitations for a second interview are at
best marginally predicted by recruiter judgments of P-0 fit (p < .lo) and
not predicted by any measures of work value congruence. However, recruiters’ judgments of employability did significantly predict invitations
for second interviews (p < .05). If judgments of general employability
are based primarily on KSA-related information, this finding might best
be interpreted in terms of a two-stage selection decision process leading
to invitations for second interviews.
This highlights a limitation of the current design. The present study
is limited in its use of a single measure of value congruence taken very
early in the recruiting process and by limited variance in invitations for
second interviews (due to economic conditions). First, it is possible that
recruiters’ exposure to the CES prior to the interview may have made,
the applicants’ work values more salient; however, this is unlikely. The
instructions for the CES direct respondents to indicate which behaviors
they feel should be emphasized on the job; thus, the CES is not presented
to respondents as a measure of work values per se. Further, recruiters’
questions and comments about the instrument at the end of the recruiting day (following their ratings of applicants), suggested that they were
blind to the purpose of the CES instrument. Second, decisions to ask a
candidate back for a second interview were made by the recruiter and
other human resource and line personnel in the organization. These
other decision makers had no face-to-face contact with the candidates,

<-----Page 16----->CHERYL L. ADKINS ET AL.

621

leaving the recruiter as the only member of the group with direct impressions of candidates’ work values. However, these other decision makers
usually did have candidates’resumes and transcripts and hence were able
to draw their own conclusions about candidates’ “general employability,” it is reasonable to expect that these conclusions were similar to the
recruiters’ conclusions.
Consequently, we might speculate that the influence of candidates’
workvalues on employment selection decisions is weak or does not occur
at the initial stage of on-campus recruiting interviews. Instead, primarily
KSA-oriented information may be used to screen candidates through to
steps in the selection process occurring closer to the ultimate selection
decision makers (i.e., second interviews, site visits, etc.). Perceptions
of work value congruence of individual line managers and/or teams of
human resource personnel and line managers may have the most impact
during the later stages of the selection process, when a decision to make
ajob offer is made (Paunonen, Jackson, & Oberman, 1987). The current
study and Rynes and Gerhart’s (1990) effort may simply have looked at
the wrong source for judgments of P-0 fit that actually impact selection.
Regardless, the relatively small portion of explained variance in each
of the dependent variables is probably due to the absence of more formal measures of candidate KSA’s in the regression equations. The current results suggest perceptions of work value congruence play a role in
recruiters’ initial perceptions of P-0 fit. Future work needs to address
two critical and previously unaddressed questions: (a) Do measures of
candidate work value congruence and/or P - 0 fit predict subsequent job
performance? and (b) Do measures of candidate value congruence contribute to the prediction of job performance beyond the levels of prediction currently obtained from more traditional KSA-oriented predictors?
Future research should address these questions using measures of work
values beyond those examined here and at later points in the recruitingselection process. As noted previously, only a portion of the organizations in the present study invited candidates for second interviews. Of
those, only 71 campus interviews (the unit of analysis) resulted in invitations for a second interview. Thus, our sample size was insufficient to
examine ultimate selection decisions.
Our “idiosyncratic fit” finding implies that systematic variance in
recruiters’ judgments of P-0 fit are unique to each recruiter. Since the
recruiters’ unique influence will generally not be found in traditional
measures of job performance, any criterion-related validities derived
from recruiters’ idiosyncratic fit ratings are expected to approach zero.
Future research also needs to explore the impact of value congruence
on judgments of P-0 fit at alternate points in the selection sequence.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

In sum, findings suggest that recruiters’ judgments of person-organization fit contain unique variance that is independent of impressions of
general employability. Applicant-recruiter work value congruence is related to recruiter judgments of person-organization fit and employability. Recruiter judgments of employability are, in turn, related to invitations for a second interview. The fact that value congruence measures
were not directly related to invitations for a second interview suggests
that if there is an effect on selection, it occurs later in the process. The
present study and previous studies (e.g., Bretz et al., 1989; Rynes & Gerhart, 1990) have explained relatively small (although statistically significant) amounts of the variance in the selection process; however, given
the increasing popularity of the notion of “fit” in the management practitioner literature (e.g., Bowen et al., 1991), it is important that we continue to study what determines recruiters’ judgments of fit.
