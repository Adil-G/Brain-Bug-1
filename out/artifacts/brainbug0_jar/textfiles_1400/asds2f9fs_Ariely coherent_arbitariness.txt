CURVES WITHOUT STABLE PREFERENCES*

In six experiments we show that initial valuations of familiar products and
simple hedonic experiences are strongly inuenced by arbitrary “anchors” (sometimes derived from a person’s social security number). Because subsequent valuations are also coherent with respect to salient differences in perceived quality or
quantity of these products and experiences, the entire pattern of valuations can
easily create an illusion of order, as if it is being generated by stable underlying
preferences. The experiments show that this combination of coherent arbitrariness
(1) cannot be interpreted as a rational response to information, (2) does not
decrease as a result of experience with a good, (3) is not necessarily reduced by
market forces, and (4) is not unique to cash prices. The results imply that demand
curves estimated from market data need not reveal true consumer preferences, in
any normatively signicant sense of the term.

Economic theories of valuation generally assume that prices
of commodities and assets are derived from underlying “fundamental” values. For example, in nance theory, asset prices are
believed to reect the market estimate of the discounted present
value of the asset’s payoff stream. In labor theory, the supply of
labor is established by the trade-off between the desire for consumption and the displeasure of work. Finally, and most importantly for this paper, consumer microeconomics assumes that the
demand curves for consumer products— chocolates, CDs, movies,
vacations, drugs, etc.—can be ultimately traced to the valuation of
pleasures that consumers anticipate receiving from these products.
Because it is difcult, as a rule, to measure fundamental
values directly, empirical tests of economic theory typically examine whether the effects of changes in circumstances on valuations are consistent with theoretical prediction—for example,
whether labor supply responds appropriately to a change in the
wage rate, whether (compensated) demand curves for commodi* We thank Colin Camerer, Shane Frederick, John Lynch, James Bettman,

ties are downward sloping, or whether stock prices respond in the
predicted way to share repurchases. However, such “comparative
static” relationships are a necessary but not sufcient condition
for fundamental valuation (e.g., Summers [1986]). Becker [1962]
was perhaps the rst to make this point explicitly when he
observed that consumers choosing commodity bundles randomly
from their budget set would nevertheless produce downward sloping demand curves.
In spite of this ambiguity in the interpretation of demand
curves, the intuition that prices must in some way derive from
fundamental values is still strongly entrenched. Psychological
evidence that preferences can be manipulated by normatively
irrelevant factors, such as option “framing,” changes in the
“choice context,” or the presence of prior cues or “anchors,” is often
rationalized by appealing to consumers’ lack of information about
the options at stake and the weak incentives operating in the
experimental setting. From the standpoint of economic theory, it
is easy to admit that consumers might not be very good at predicting the pleasures and pains produced by a purchase, especially if the purchase option is complex and the choice hypothetical. It is harder to accept that consumers might have difculty
establishing how much they value each individual bit of pleasure
or pain in a situation where they can experience the full extent of
this pleasure or pain just before the pricing decision.
In this paper we show that consumers’ absolute valuation of
experience goods is surprisingly arbitrary, even under “full information” conditions. However, we also show that consumers’ relative valuations of different amounts of the good appear orderly, as if
supported by demand curves derived from fundamental preferences.
Valuations therefore display a combination of arbitrariness and
coherence that we refer to as “coherent arbitrariness.”
Our ndings are consistent with an account of revealed preference which posits that valuations are initially malleable but
become “imprinted” (i.e., precisely dened and largely invariant),
after the individual is called upon to make an initial decision.1
Prior to imprinting, valuations have a large arbitrary component,
meaning that they are highly responsive to both normative and
nonnormative inuences. Following imprinting, valuations be1. The idea that preferences are not well dened, but become articulated in
the process of making a decision is consistent with a large body of research on
what decision researchers refer to as “constructed preferences” (e.g., Slovic [1995]
and Hoefer and Ariely [1999]).

come locally coherent, as the consumer attempts to reconcile
future decisions of a “similar kind” with the initial one. This
creates an illusion of order, because consumers’ coherent responses to subsequent changes in conditions disguise the arbitrary nature of the initial, foundational, choice.
I. EXPERIMENT 1: COHERENTLY ARBITRARY VALUATION
OF ORDINARY PRODUCTS
Our experiments take an old trick from the experimental
psychologists’ arsenal—the anchoring manipulation—and use it
to inuence valuation of products and hedonic experiences with
normatively irrelevant factors. In a famous early demonstration
of anchoring, Tversky and Kahneman [1974] spun a wheel of
fortune with numbers that ranged from 0 to 100, asked subjects
whether the number of African nations in the United Nations was
greater than or less than that number, and then instructed subjects to estimate the actual gure. Estimates were signicantly
related to the number spun on the wheel (the “anchor”), even
though subjects could clearly see that the number had been
generated by a purely chance process.2 This, and many other
anchoring studies seemed to show that people lack preexisting
subjective probability distributions over unknown quantities.
The vast majority of anchoring experiments in the psychological literature have focused on how anchoring corrupts subjective judgment, not subjective valuation or preference. Because
valuation typically involves judgment, however, it is not surprising that valuation, too, can be moved up or down by the anchoring
manipulation. Johnson and Schkade [1989] were the rst to demonstrate this experimentally. They showed that asking subjects
whether their certainty equivalent for a lottery is above or below
an anchor value inuences subsequently stated certainty equivalents. Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, and McFadden [1998], and
Kahneman and Knetsch [1993], found the same effect with
judgments of willingness-to-pay for public goods; higher values
in the initial Yes/No question led to higher subsequent
willingness-to-pay.
Our rst experiment replicates these results with ordinary

consumer products. The rst class meeting of a market research
course in the Sloan School MBA program provided the setting for
the study. Fifty-ve students were shown six products (computer
accessories, wine bottles, luxury chocolates, and books), which
were briey described without mentioning market price. The
average retail price of the items was about $70. After introducing
the products, subjects were asked whether they would buy each
good for a dollar gure equal to the last two digits of their social
security number. After this Accept/Reject response, they stated
their dollar maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the product.
A random device determined whether the product would in fact
be sold on the basis of the rst, Accept/Reject response, or the
second, WTP response (via the incentive-compatible Becker-Degroot-Marschak procedure [1963]). Subjects understood that both
their Accept/Reject response and their WTP response had some
chance of being decisive for the purchase, and that they were
eligible to purchase at most one product.
In spite of the realism of the products and transaction, the
impact of the social security number on stated WTP was signicant in every product category. Subjects with above-median social
security numbers stated values from 57 percent to 107 percent
greater than did subjects with below-median numbers. The effect
is even more striking when examining the valuations by quintiles
of the social security number distribution, as shown in Table I.
The valuations of the top quintile subjects were typically greater
by a factor of three. For example, subjects with social security

<-----Page 4----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

77

numbers in the top quintile were willing to pay $56 on average for
a cordless computer keyboard, compared with $16 on average for
subjects with bottom quintile numbers. Evidently, these subjects
did not have, or were unable to retrieve personal values for
ordinary products.
Alongside this volatility of absolute preference we also observed a marked stability of relative preference. For example, the
vast majority of subjects (.95 percent) valued a cordless keyboard more than a trackball, and the highly rated wine more than
the lower-rated wine. Subjects, it seems, did not know how much
they valued these items, but they did know the relative ordering
within the categories of wine and computer accessories.
II. COHERENT ARBITRARINESS
The sensitivity of WTP to anchors suggests that consumers
do not arrive at a choice or at a pricing task with an inventory of
preexisting preferences and probability distributions, which is
consistent with a great deal of other psychological evidence [Kahneman and Miller 1986; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993;
Drolet, Simonson, and Tversky 2000]. Rather than specic WTP
values for products, consumers probably have some range of
acceptable values. If a give-or-take price for a product falls outside this range, then the purchase decision is straightforward:
“Don’t Buy” if the price is above the range, and “Buy” if the price
is below the range. But, what if the stated price falls within the
WTP range, so that the range does not determine the decision,
one way or the other? We do not know much about how a choice
in such a case might be made. We do know that if the situation
demands a choice, then the person will in fact choose, i.e., will
either purchase or not purchase. We assume that this “foundational” choice then becomes a part of that person’s stock of decisional precedents, ready to be invoked the next time a similar
choice situation arises [Gilboa and Schmeidler 1995].
To relate this discussion to our actual experiment, suppose
that a subject with a social security number ending with 25 has
an a priori WTP range of $5 to $30 for wine described as “average,” and $10 to $50 for the “rare” wine. Both wines, therefore,
might or might not be purchased for the $25 price. Suppose that
the subject indicates, for whatever reason, that she would be
willing to purchase the average bottle for $25. If we were to ask
her a moment later whether she would be willing to purchase the

<-----Page 5----->78

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

“rare” bottle for $25, the answer would obviously be “yes,” because
from her perspective this particular “choice problem” has been
solved and its solution is known: if an average wine is worth at
least $25, then a rare wine must be worth more than $25! Moreover, when the subject is subsequently asked to provide WTP
values for the wines, then that problem, too, is now substantially
constrained: the prices will have to be ordered so that both prices
are above $25 and the rare wine is valued more.
There are many psychological details that we are not specifying. We do not say much about how the choice is made if the
price falls within the range, nor do we propose a psychological
mechanism for the anchoring effect itself. There are several psychological accounts of anchoring, and for our purposes it is not
necessary to decide between them [Epley and Gilovich 2001;
Mussweiler and Strack 2001]. The substantive claims we do make
are the following: rst, in situations in which valuations are not
constrained by prior precedents, choices will be highly sensitive to
normatively irrelevant inuences and considerations such as anchoring. Second, because decisions at the earlier stages are used
as inputs for future decisions, an initial choice will exert a normatively inappropriate inuence over subsequent choices and
values. Third, if we look at a series of choices by a single individual, they will exhibit an orderly pattern (coherence) with respect
to numerical parameters like price, quantity, quality, and so on.3
Behaviorally then, consumers in the marketplace may
largely obey the axioms of revealed preference; indeed, according
to this account, a person who remembered all previous choices
and accepted the transitivity axiom would never violate transitivity. However, we cannot infer from this that these choices
reveal true preferences. Transitivity may only reect the fact that
consumers remember earlier choices and make subsequent
3. Another research literature, on “evaluability,” is also relevant here.
“Evaluability” has been identied as the cause of preference reversals that arise
when options are evaluated either jointly (within subject) or separately (between
subject). Hsee, Loewenstein, Blount, and Bazerman [1999] explain these reversals
by assuming that it is more difcult to evaluate some attributes separately than
jointly, depending on whether the attributes have well-established standards. For
example, subjects in one study were asked to assess two political candidates, one
who would bring 1000 jobs to the district and the other who would bring 5000 jobs
to the district but had a DUI conviction. When the candidates were evaluated
separately, the rst candidate was judged more favorably, presumably because
the employment gure was hard to evaluate. However, when the candidates were
compared side-by-side, people indicated that the employment difference more
than compensated for the DUI conviction, and gave their preference to the second
candidate.

<-----Page 6----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

79

choices in a fashion that is consistent with them, not that these
choices are generated from preexisting preferences.
III. V ALUATION

OF

NOVEL PAIN EXPERIENCES

If preferences and valuations at a moment in time are largely
inferences that a person draws from the history of his or her own
previous decisions, a natural question that arises is whether the
inference has a narrow scope (restricted only to very similar
previous choices) or whether the scope is more general. For example, if I go on record as being willing to pay $25 for a wine, will
that only inuence my subsequent willingness-to-pay for wine,
for a broader range of items or experiences, or even for pleasures
generally? The broader the scope of inferences, the more will
previous choices constrain any future choice. If purchases of
specic products and services function as precedents not just for
those same items but also for the general valuation of pleasure
(including here the avoidance of discomfort), then an adult consumer should have accumulated an inventory of previous choices
sufcient to stabilize his or her dollar valuation of hedonic
experiences.
In the next ve experiments, we address the question of
whether consumers do indeed enter the laboratory with a stable,
preexisting valuation of pleasure and pain. In each experiment,
subjects stated their willingness to accept (WTA) pains of different durations (induced by a loud noise played over headphones)—in exchange for payment. Subjects were initially exposed to a sample of the noise, and then asked whether—
hypothetically—they would be willing to experience the same
noise again in exchange for a payment of magnitude X (with X
varied across subjects). Their actual WTAs were then elicited for
different noise durations.
We used this articial hedonic “product” for several reasons.
First, we were able to provide subjects with a sample of the
experience before they made subsequent decisions about whether
to experience it again in exchange for payment. They therefore
entered the pricing phase of the experiment with full information
about the experience they were pricing. Second, we wanted to
avoid a situation in which subjects could solve the pricing problem intellectually, without drawing on their own sensory experience. Annoying sounds have no clear market price, so our subjects
could not refer to similar decisions made outside the laboratory as

<-----Page 7----->80

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

a basis for their valuations. Third, we wanted to make the money
stakes in this decision comparable to the stakes in routine consumer expenditures. The plausible range of values for avoiding
the annoying sounds in our experiments ranges from a few cents,
to several dollars. Fourth, with annoying sounds it is possible to
re-create the same hedonic experience repeatedly, permitting an
experiment with repeated trials. Prior research shows that with
annoying sounds, unlike many other types of pleasures and pains,
there is little or no satiation or sensitization to repeated presentations of annoying sounds [Ariely and Zauberman 2000].
IV. EXPERIMENT 2: COHERENTLY ARBITRARY VALUATION

OF

PAIN

The goal of Experiment 2 was to test 1) whether valuation of
annoying sounds was susceptible to an anchoring manipulation;
2) whether additional experience with the sounds would erode the
inuence of the anchor; and 3) whether valuation would be sensitive to a within-subject manipulation of the duration of the
annoying sound, thus demonstrating coherence with respect to
this attribute.
One hundred and thirty-two students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology participated in the experiment. Approximately half were undergraduates, and the rest were MBA
students or, in a few cases, recruiters from large investment
banks. Subjects were randomly assigned to six experimental conditions. The experiment lasted about 25 minutes, and subjects
were paid according to their performance as described below.
At the beginning of the experiment, all subjects listened to an
annoying, 30-second sound, delivered through headphones. The
sound was a high-pitched scream (a triangular wave with frequency of 3,000 Hz), similar to the broadcasting warning signal.
The main experimental manipulation was the anchor price,
which was manipulated between-subject at three levels: an anchor price of 10¢ (low-anchor), and anchor price of 50¢ (highanchor), and no anchor (no-anchor). Subjects in the low-anchor
[high-anchor] condition rst encountered a screen that read:4
In a few moments we are going to play you a new unpleasant tone over
your headset. We are interested in how annoying you nd it to be. Immediately
4. In a different study [Ariely, Loewenstein, and Prelec 2002] we tested
whether the order in which subjects received the sample and the anchor made a
difference. It did not.

<-----Page 8----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

81

after you hear the tone, we are going to ask you whether you would be willing
to repeat the same experience in exchange for a payment of 10¢ [50¢].

Subjects in the no-anchor condition listened to the sound but were
not given any external price and were not asked to answer any
hypothetical question.
Before the main part of the experiment started, subjects were
told that they would be asked to indicate the amount of payment
they required to listen to sounds that differed in duration but
were identical in quality and intensity to the one they had just
heard. Subjects were further told that on each trial the computer
would randomly pick a price from a given price distribution. If the
computer’s price was higher than their price, the subject would
hear the sound and also receive a payment corresponding to the
price that the computer had randomly drawn. If the computer’s
price was lower than their price, they would neither hear the
sound nor receive payment for that trial. Subjects were told that
this procedure ensured that the best strategy is to pick the minimum price for which they would be willing to listen to the sound,
not a few pennies more and not a few pennies less. The prices
picked by the computer were drawn from a triangle-distribution
ranging from 5¢ to 100¢, with the lower numbers being more
frequent than the higher numbers. The distribution was displayed on the screen for subjects to study and, importantly, the
distribution was the same for all subjects.
After learning about the procedure, subjects engaged in a
sequence of nine trials. On each trial, they were informed of the
duration of the sound they were valuing (10, 30, or 60 seconds)
and were asked to indicate their WTA for the sound. The three
durations were presented either in an increasing (10 seconds, 30
seconds, 60 seconds) or decreasing order (60 seconds, 30 seconds,
10 seconds). In both cases, each ordered sequence repeated itself
three times, one after the other. After each WTA entry, the
computer asked subjects whether they were willing to experience
the sound for that price minus 5¢, and whether they would
experience it for that price plus 5¢. If subjects did not answer “no”
to the rst question and “yes” to the second, the computer drew
their attention to the fact that their WTA was not consistent with
their responses, and asked to them to reconsider their WTA price.
After nalizing a WTA value, subjects were shown their price
along with the random price drawn from the distribution. If the
price specied by the subject was higher than the computer’s

<-----Page 9----->82

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

price, the subject did not receive any payment for that trial and
continued directly to the next trial. If the price set by the subject
was lower than the computer’s price, the subject heard the sound
over the headphones, was reminded that the payment for the trial
would be given to them at the end of the experiment, and then
continued to the next trial. At the end of the nine trials, all
subjects were paid according to the payment rule.
Results. A set of simple effect comparisons revealed that
average WTA in the high-anchor condition [M 5 59.60] was
signicantly higher than average WTA in either the low-anchor
condition [M 5 39.82; F(1,126) 5 19.25, p , 0.001] or the
no-anchor condition [M 5 43.87; F(1,126) 5 12.17, p ,
0.001]. 5 WTA in the low-anchor condition was not signicantly
different from WTA in the no-anchor condition [ p 5 0.37]. Because subjects in the high-anchor condition specied higher
WTAs, they naturally listened to fewer sounds [M 5 2.8] than
subjects in the low-anchor and no-anchor conditions [Ms 5 4.5
and 4.1; F(1,126) 5 14.26, p , 0.001]. High-anchor subjects
also earned signicantly less money on average [M 5 $1.53]
than those in the no-anchor condition and the low-anchor condition [Ms 5 $2.06, and $2.16; F(1,126) 5 7.99, p , 0.005].
Although there was a signicant drop in WTA values from
the rst to the second replication [F(1,252) 5 17.54, p , 0.001],
there was no evidence of convergence of WTA among the different
anchor conditions. Such convergence would have produced a signicant interaction between the repetition factor and the anchoring manipulation, but this interaction was not signicant.6
WTA values were highly sensitive to duration in the expected
direction [F(2,252) 5 294.46, p , 0.001] (for more discussion of
sensitivity to duration see Ariely and Loewenstein [2000] and
Kahneman, Wakker, and Sarin [1997]). The mean price for the 10
second sound [M 5 28.35] was signicantly lower than the mean
5. For the purpose of statistical analysis, responses above 100¢ (7.7 percent)
were truncated to 101¢ (the highest random price selected by computer was 100¢,
so responses above 101¢ were strategically equivalent). Repeating the analyses
using untruncated values did not qualify any of the ndings.
6. A variety of different tests of convergence produced similar results. First,
we carried out an ANOVA analysis in which we took only the rst and last trial
as the repeated measure dependent variable. Again, the interaction between trial
(rst versus last) and the anchoring manipulation was nonsignicant. We also
estimated the linear trend of WTA over time for each subject. The estimated
trends were decreasing, but the rate of decline did not differ signicantly between
the two anchoring conditions.

price for the 30 second sound [M 5 48.69; F(1,252) 5 169.46,

lower than the mean price for the 60 second sound [M 5 66.25;
F(1,252) 5 126.06, p , 0.001].
Figure I provides a graphical illustration of the results thus
far. First, the vertical displacement between the lines shows the
powerful effect of the anchoring manipulation. Second, despite
the arbitrariness revealed by the effect of the anchoring manipulation, there is a strong and almost linear relationship between
WTA and duration. Finally, there is no evidence of convergence
between the different conditions across the nine trials.
Figure II provides additional support for the tight connection
between WTA and duration. For each subject, we calculated the
ratio of WTA in each of the durations to each of the other durations, and plotted these separately for the three conditions. As
can be seen in the gure, the ratios of WTAs are stable, and
independent of condition (there are no signicant differences by
condition).
In summary, Experiment 2 demonstrates arbitrary but coherent pricing of painful experiences, even when there is no
uncertainty about the nature or duration of the experience. Nei-

ther repeated experience with the event, nor confrontation with
the same price distribution, overrode the impact of the initial
anchor.
V. EXPERIMENT 3: RAISING

THE

STAKES

Experiment 3 was designed to address two possible objections to the previous procedure. First, it could be argued that
subjects might have somehow believed that the anchor was informative, even though they had experienced the sound for themselves. For example, they might have thought that the sound
posed some small risk to their hearing, and might have believed
that the anchor roughly corresponded to the monetary value of
this risk. To eliminate this possibility, Experiment 3 used subjects’ own social security numbers as anchors. Second, one might
be concerned that the small stakes in the previous experiment
provided minimal incentives for accurate responding, which may
have increased the arbitrariness of subjects’ responses and their
sensitivity to the anchor. Experiment 3, therefore, raised the
stakes by a factor of ten. In addition, at the end of the experiment,
we added a question designed to test whether the anchor-induced
changes in valuation carry over to trade-offs involving other
experiences.
Ninety students from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-

<-----Page 12----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

nology participated in the experiment. The procedure closely followed that of Experiment 2, except that the stimuli were ten
times as long: the shortest stimulus lasted 100 seconds; the next
lasted 300 seconds, and longest lasted 600 seconds. The manipulation of the anchor in this experiment was also different. At the
onset of the experiment, subjects were asked to provide the rst
three digits of their social security number and were instructed to
turn these digits into a money amount (e.g., 678 translates into
$6.78). Subjects were then asked whether, hypothetically, they
would listen again to the sound they just experienced (for 300
seconds) if they were paid the money amount they had generated
from their social security number.
In the main part of the experiment, subjects had three opportunities to listen to sounds in exchange for payment. The three
different durations were again ordered in either an increasing set
(100 seconds, 300 seconds, 600 seconds) or a decreasing set (600
seconds, 300 seconds, 100 seconds). In each trial, after they indicated their WTA, subjects were shown both their own price and
the random price drawn from the distribution (which was the
distribution used in Experiment 2 but multiplied by 10). If the
price set by the subject was higher than the computer’s price,
subjects continued directly to the next trial. If the price set by the
subjects was lower than the computer’s price, subjects received
the sound and the money associated with it (the amount set by
the randomly drawn number), and then continued to the next
trial. This process repeated itself three times, once for each of the
three durations.
After completing the three trials, subjects were asked to
rank-order a list of events in terms of how annoying they found
them (for a list of the different tasks, see Table II). At the end of
the experiment, subjects were paid according to the payment rule.
Results. The three digits entered ranged from 041 (translated to $0.41) to 997 (translated to $9.97), with a mean of 523
and a median of 505. Figure III compares the prices demanded by
subjects with social security numbers above and below the median. It is evident that subjects with lower social security numbers required substantially less payment than subjects with
higher numbers [Ms 5 $3.55, and $5.76; F(1,88) 5 28.45, p ,
0.001). Both groups were coherent with respect to duration,
demanding more payment for longer sounds [F(2,176) 5 92.53,
p , 0.001]. As in the previous experiment, there was also a small

a value, we would expect responses to the initial question to be
relatively close to the anchor, regardless of whether the duration
was 100 seconds or 600 seconds. However, having committed
themselves to a particular value for the initial sound, we would
expect the increasing duration group to then adjust their values
upward while the decreasing group should adjust their anchor
downward. This would create a much larger discrepancy between
the two groups’ valuations of the nal sound than existed for the
initial sound. Figure IV shows that the prediction is supported.
Initial valuations of the 600 second tone in the decreasing order
condition [M 5 $5.16] were signicantly larger than initial
valuations of the 100 second tone in the increasing order condition [M 5 $3.78; t(88) 5 3.1, p , .01], but the difference of
$1.38 is not very large. In the second period, both groups evaluated the same 300 second tone, and the valuation in the increasing condition was greater than that of the decreasing condition
[Ms 5 $5.56, and $3.65; t(88) 5 3.5, p , .001]. By the nal
period, the two conditions diverged dramatically with WTA being
much higher in the increasing condition compared with the de-

<-----Page 15----->88

creasing condition [Ms 5 $7.15, and $2.01; t(88) 5 9.4, p ,
.0001].
We now turn to the rank-ordering of the different events in
terms of their annoyance (see Table II). Recall that we wanted to
see whether the same anchor that inuenced subjects’ pricing
would also inuence the way they evaluated the sounds independently of the pricing task. The results showed that the rankordering of the annoyance of the sound was not inuenced by
either the anchor [F(1,86) 5 1.33, p 5 0.25], or the order
[F(1,86) 5 0.221, p 5 0.64]. In fact, when we examined the
correlation between the rank-ordering of the annoyance of the
sound and the initial anchor, the correlation was slightly negative
(20.096), although this nding was not signicant ( p 5 0.37).
In summary, Experiment 3 demonstrates that coherent arbitrariness persists even with randomly generated anchors and
larger stakes. In addition, the last part of Experiment 3 provides
some evidence that the effect of the anchor on pricing does not
inuence the evaluation of the experience relative to other
experiences.
VI. EXPERIMENT 4: COHERENTLY ARBITRARY VALUATIONS
IN THE M ARKET
We now consider the possibility that the presence of market
forces could reduce the degree of initial arbitrariness or facilitate
learning over time. Earlier research that compared judgments
made by individuals who were isolated or who interacted in a
market found that market forces did reduce the magnitude of a
cognitive bias called the “curse of knowledge” by approximately
50 percent [Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber 1989].
To test whether market forces would reduce the magnitude of
the bias, we exposed subjects to an arbitrary anchor (as in the
second experiment), but then elicited the WTA values through a
multiperson auction, rather than using the Becker-Degroot-Marschak [1963] procedure. Our conjecture was that the market
would not reduce the bias, but would lead to a convergence of
prices within specic markets. Earlier research found that subjects who had bid on gambles in an auction similar to ours,
adjusted their own bids in response to the market price, which
carried information about the bids of other market participants
[Cox and Grether 1996]. Relying on others’ values can be informative in some purchase settings, but in these markets other

<-----Page 16----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

89

participants had been exposed to the same arbitrary anchor.
Moreover, having experienced a sample of the noise, subjects had
full information about the consumption experience, which makes
the valuations of others prescriptively irrelevant.
Fifty-three students from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology participated in the experiment, in exchange for a
payment of $5 and earnings from the experiment. Subjects were
told that they would participate in a marketplace for annoying
sounds, and that they would bid for the opportunity to earn
money by listening to annoying sounds. They participated in the
experiment in groups, varying in size from six to eight subjects.
The experiment lasted approximately 25 minutes.
The design and procedure were very similar to Experiment 2,
but we increased the high anchor to $1.00 (instead of 50¢) and
used an auction, rather than individual-level pricing procedure.
As in the second experiment, the sound durations were 10, 30, or
60 seconds, subjects were given three opportunities to listen to
each of these sounds and the order of the durations was manipulated between subjects. In the increasing condition, durations
were presented in the order 10, 30, 60 seconds (repeated three
times), and in the decreasing condition the durations were in the
order 60, 30, 10 seconds (also repeated three times). All subjects
rst experienced 30 seconds of the same annoying sound that was
used in the second experiment. Next, the bidding procedure was
explained to the subjects as follows:
On each trial, the experimenter will announce the duration of the sound
to be auctioned. At this stage every one of you will be asked to write down and
submit your bid. Once all the bids are submitted, they will be written on the
board by the experimenter, and the three people with the lowest bids will get
the sound they bid for and get paid the amount set by the bid of the fourth
lowest person.

Subjects were then asked to write down whether, in a hypothetical choice, a sum of X (10¢ or 100¢ depending on their
condition) would be sufcient compensation for them to listen to
the sound again. At this point the main part of the experiment
started. On each of the nine trials, the experimenter announced
the duration of the sound that was being auctioned; each of the
subjects wrote a bid on a piece of paper and passed it to the
experimenter, who wrote the bids on a large board. At that point,
the three lowest bidders were announced, and they were asked to
put on their headphones, and listen to the sound. After the sound

<-----Page 17----->90

FIGURE V

Anchor Conditions

ended the subjects who “won” the sound received the amount set
by the fourth lowest bid.
Results. The general ndings paralleled those from the previous experiments. In the low-anchor condition, the average bids
were 24¢, 38¢, and 67¢ for the 10, 30, and 60 second sounds,
respectively (all differences between sound durations are signicant within a condition), and in the high-anchor condition, the
corresponding average bids were 47¢, $1.32, and $2.11. Overall,
mean WTA in the low-anchor condition was signicantly lower
than WTA in the high-anchor condition [F(1,49) 5 20.38, p ,
0.001]. The difference in the amount of money earned by subjects
in the two conditions was quite stunning: the mean payment per
sound in the high-anchor condition was $.59, while the mean
payment in the low-anchor condition was only $.08.
The main question that Experiment 4 was designed to address is whether the WTA prices for the low and high anchor
conditions would converge over time. As can be seen from Figure
V, there is no evidence of convergence, whether one looks at mean
bids or the mean of the prices that emerged from the auction.
Although the bids and auction prices in the different conditions did not converge to a common value, bids within each group

<-----Page 18----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

91

FIGURE VI
The within-Group Standard Deviations of the Bids (WTA), Plotted as a
Function of Trial

did converge toward that group’s arbitrary value. Figure VI,
which plots the mean standard deviation of bids in the eight
different markets for each of the nine trials, provides visual
support for such convergence. To test whether convergence was
signicant, we rst estimated the linear trend in standard deviations across the nine rounds separately for each group. Only one
of the eight within-group trends was positive (0.25), and the rest
were negative (ranging from 20.76 to 214.89). A two-tailed t-test
of these eight estimates showed that they were signicantly negative [t(7) 5 2.44, p , 0.05].
In summary, Experiment 4 demonstrates that coherent arbitrariness is robust to market forces. Indeed, by exposing people
to others who were exposed to the same arbitrary inuences,
markets can strengthen the impact of arbitrary stimuli, such as
anchors, on valuation.
VII. EXPERIMENT 5: THE IMPACT

OF

M ULTIPLE ANCHORS

According to our account of preference formation, the very
rst valuation in a given domain has an arbitrary component that
makes it vulnerable to anchoring and similar manipulations.
However, once individuals express these somewhat arbitrary values, they later behave in a fashion that is consistent with them,

<-----Page 19----->92

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

which constrains the range of subsequent choices and renders
them less subject to nonnormative inuences. To test this, Experiment 5 exposed subjects to three different anchors instead of
only one. If the imprinting account is correct, then the rst anchor
should have a much greater impact on valuations compared with
later ones. On the other hand, if subjects are paying attention to
anchors because they believe they carry information, then all
anchors would have the same impact as the initial one (similarly,
Bayesian updating predicts that the order in which information
arrives is irrelevant).
At the end of the pricing part of the experiment, we gave
subjects a direct-choice between an annoying sound and a completely different unpleasant stimulus. We did this to see whether
the inuence of the anchor extends beyond prices to qualitative
judgments of relative aversiveness.
Forty-four students from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology participated in the experiment, which lasted about 25
minutes. The experiment followed a procedure similar to the one
used in Experiment 2, with the following adjustments. First,
there were only three trials, each lasting 30 seconds. Second, and
most important, in each of the three trials subjects were introduced to a new sound with different characteristics: a constant
high-pitched sound (the same as in Experiment 2), a uctuating
high-pitched sound (which oscillated around the volume of the
high-pitched sound), or white noise (a broad spectrum sound).
The important aspect of these sounds is that they are qualitatively different from each other, but similarly aversive.
After hearing each sound, subjects were asked if, hypothetically, they would listen to it again for 30 seconds in exchange for
10¢, 50¢, or 90¢ (depending on the condition and the trial number). Subjects in the increasing conditions answered the hypothetical questions in increasing order (10¢, 50¢, 90¢), and subjects in the decreasing conditions answered the hypothetical
questions in decreasing order (90¢, 50¢, 10¢). Each of these hypothetical questions was coupled with a different sound. After
answering each hypothetical question, subjects went on to specify
the smallest amount of compensation they would require to listen
to 30 seconds of that sound (WTA). The same Becker-DegrootMarschak [1963] procedure used in Experiment 2 determined
whether subjects heard each sound again and how much they
were paid for listening to it.
After the three trials, subjects were asked to place their

Mean WTA (in Cents) for the Three Annoying Sounds

nger in a vise (see Ariely [1998]). The experimenter closed the
vise slowly until the subject indicated that he/she just began to
experience the pressure as painful—a point called the “pain
threshold.” After the pain threshold was established, the experimenter tightened the vise an additional 1 mm (a quarter-turn in
the handle) and instructed the subject to remember the level of
pain. Subjects then experienced the same sound, and answered
the same anchoring question that they had been asked, in the
rst trial. They were then asked if they would prefer to experience the same sound for 30 seconds or the vise for 30 seconds.
Results. Figure VII displays mean WTAs for the three annoying sounds, and the two anchoring orders. With respect to the
rst bid, the low anchor generated signicantly lower bids [M 5
33.5¢] than the high anchor [M 5 72.8¢; F(1,42) 5 30.96, p ,
0.001]. More interesting is the way subjects reacted to the second
bid, which had the same anchor (50¢) for both conditions. In this
case, we can see that there was a carryover effect from the rst
bid, so that the mean WTA price for the sound in the increasing
condition [M 5 43.5¢] was lower than the sound in the decreasing condition [M 5 63.2¢; F(1,42) 5 6.03, p , 0.02]. The most

<-----Page 21----->94

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

interesting comparison, however, is the WTA associated with the
third sound. For this sound, subjects in both conditions had been
exposed to the same three anchors, but the effects of the initial
anchor and the most recent anchor (preceding the nal stimulus)
were in opposition to each other. In the increasing condition, the
initial anchor was 10¢, and the most recent anchor was 90¢. In
the decreasing condition, the initial anchor was 90¢, and the most
recent anchor was 10¢. If the most recent anchor is stronger than
the initial anchor, then WTA in the increasing condition should
be higher than the one in the decreasing condition. If the initial
anchor is stronger than the most recent anchor, as predicted by
the imprinting account, then WTA in the decreasing condition
should be higher than WTA in the increasing condition. In fact,
WTA was higher in the decreasing condition compared with the
increasing condition [Ms 5 63.1¢, and 45.3¢; F(1,42) 5 5.82,
p , 0.03]. Thus, the initial anchor has a stronger effect on WTA
than the anchor that immediately preceded the WTA judgment,
even though the initial anchor had been associated with a qualitatively different sound.
Another way to examine the results of Experiment 5 is to look
at the binary responses to the hypothetical questions (the anchoring manipulation). In the rst trial, the proportion of subjects
who stated that they would be willing to listen to the sound they
had just heard for X¢ was different, but not signicantly so,
across the two anchor values (55 percent for 10¢, and 73 percent
for 90¢; p . .20 by x2 test). The small differences in responses to
these two radically different values supports the idea that subjects did not have rm internal values for the sounds before they
encountered the rst hypothetical question. On the third trial,
however, the difference was highly signicant (41 percent for 10¢,
and 82 percent for 90¢, p , .001 by x2 test). Subjects who were
in the increasing-anchor condition were much more willing to
listen to the sound, compared with subjects in the decreasinganchor condition, indicating that they were sensitive to the
change in money amounts across the three hypothetical questions. Consistent with the imprinting account proposed earlier,
subjects acquired a stable internal reservation price for the
sounds.
The response to the choice between the sound and vise pain
revealed that subjects in the increasing-anchor condition had a
higher tendency to pick the sound (72 percent), compared with
the decreasing-anchor condition (64 percent), but this difference

<-----Page 22----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

95

was not statistically signicant ( p 5 0.52). These results again
fail to support the idea that the anchor affects subjects’ evaluations of the sound relative to other stimuli.
VIII. EXPERIMENT 6: MONEY ONLY?
The previous experiments demonstrated arbitrariness in
money valuations. Neither of the follow-up studies (in Experiments 3 and 5), however, found that the anchoring manipulation
affected subsequent choices between the unpleasant sounds and
other experiences. This raises the question of whether these null
results reect the fact that the effects of the anchor are narrow, or
rather that the coherent arbitrariness phenomenon arises only
with a relatively abstract response dimension, like money. To
address this issue, we conducted an experiment that employed a
design similar to that of Experiments 2– 4 but which did not
involve money. Because Experiments 2– 4 had all demonstrated
coherence on the dimension of duration, in Experiment 6 we
attempted to demonstrate arbitrariness with respect to duration.
Fifty-nine subjects were recruited on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley with the promise of receiving
$5.00 in exchange for a few minutes of their time and for experiencing some mildly noxious stimuli. After consenting to participate, they were rst exposed to the two unpleasant stimuli used
in the experiment: a small sample of an unpleasant-tasting liquid
composed of equal parts Gatorade and vinegar, and an aversive
sound (the same as used in Experiments 2– 4). They were then
shown three containers of different sizes (1 oz., 2 oz., and 4 oz.),
each lled with the liquid they had just tasted and were asked to
“please answer the following hypothetical question: would you
prefer the middle size drink or X minutes of the sound,” where X
was one minute for half the subjects and three minutes for the
other half (the anchor manipulation). After the initial anchoring
question, subjects were shown three transparent bottles with
different drink quantities in each (1 oz., 2 oz., and 4 oz.). For each
of the three drink quantities, subjects indicated whether they
would prefer to drink that quantity of liquid or endure a sound of
duration equal to 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, etc. up to
eight minutes. (The specic instructions were: “On each line,
please indicate if you prefer that duration of the sound to the
amount of the drink. Once you have answered all the questions
the experimenter will pick one of the lines at random, and you

will be asked to experience the sound described on that line or the
drink depending on your preference in that line.”) To simplify the
task, the choices were arranged in separate blocks for each drink
size, and were arranged in order of duration.
Results. Revealing arbitrariness with respect to tone duration, the anchoring manipulation had a signicant impact on
trade-offs between the sound’s duration and drink quantity
[F(1,57) 5 24.7, p , .0001]. The mean maximum tone duration
at which subjects preferred the tone to the drink (averaging over
the three drink sizes) was 82 seconds in the one minute anchor
condition, and 162 seconds in the three minute anchor condition.
Revealing consistency with respect to tone duration, however,
subjects were willing to tolerate longer sound durations when the
other option involved larger drink size [F(2,114) 5 90.4, p ,
.0001] (see Figure VIII).
The experiment demonstrates that arbitrariness is not limited to monetary valuations (and, less importantly, that coherence is not an inherent property of duration).7 In combination
7. In a discussion of the arbitrary nature of judgments in “contingent valuation” research, Kahneman, Schkade, and Sunstein [1998] and Kaheman, Ritov,
and Schkade [1999] point out a similarity to some classical results in psycho-

<-----Page 24----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

97

with the results of the add-on components of Experiments 3 and
5, it suggests that the web of consistency that people draw from
their own choices may be narrow. Thus, for example, a subject in
our rst experiment with a high social security number who
priced the average wine at $25, would almost surely price the
higher quality wine above $25. However, the same individual’s
subsequent choice of whether to trade the higher quality wine for
a different type of good might be relatively unaffected by her
pricing of the wine, and hence by the social security number
anchoring manipulation.
IX. GENERAL DISCUSSION
The main experiments presented here (Experiments 2– 4)
show that when people assess their own willingness to listen to an
unpleasant noise in exchange for payment, the money amounts
they specify display the pattern that we call “coherent arbitrariness.” Experiment 1 demonstrated the pattern with familiar consumer products, and Experiment 6 showed that the pattern is not
restricted to judgments about money. Coherent arbitrariness has
two aspects: coherence, whereby people respond in a robust and
sensible fashion to noticeable changes or differences in relevant
variables, and arbitrariness, whereby these responses occur
around a base-level that is normatively arbitrary.

physical scaling of sensory magnitude. The well-known “ratio scaling” procedure
[Stevens 1975] asks subjects to assign positive numbers to physical stimuli (e.g.,
tones of different loudness) in such a manner that the ratio of numbers matches
the ratio of subjectively perceived magnitudes. Sometimes the subjects are told
that a reference tone has a certain numerical value (e.g., 100) which is also called
“the modulus,” while in other procedural variants, subjects have no reference tone
and are left to assign numbers as they please. In the latter case, one nds typically
that the absolute numbers assigned to a given physical stimulus have little
signicance (are extremely variable across subjects), but the ratios of numbers are
relatively stable (across subjects). Kahneman et al. [1998, 1999] point out that the
money scale used in WTP is formally an unbounded ratio scale, like the number
scale used in psychophysics, and hence should inherit the same combination of
arbitrary absolute but stable relative levels. However, unlike the psychophysical
setting in which the response modulus is truly arbitrary (the subjects do not come
to the experiment knowing what a 100-point loudness level is), the WTP response
scale is not at all arbitrary. Subjects should know what a dollar is worth in terms
of other small pleasures and conveniences. If we had asked subjects to evaluate
the sounds in terms of uninterpreted “points” rather than dollars, then we would
have duplicated the psychophysical procedure of scaling without a modulus, but in
that case, of course, the results would be predictable and uninteresting. In any
case, the results of Experiment 6 show that exactly the same pattern of coherent
arbitrariness can be obtained with well-dened attributes such as duration and
drink size.

<-----Page 25----->98

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

Our main focus up to this point was to demonstrate the
coherent arbitrariness phenomenon, and test whether it is reduced or eliminated by repeated experience, market forces, or
higher stakes. Next, we discuss a variety of other phenomena that
may be interpreted as manifestations of coherent arbitrariness.
X. A. C ONTINGENT VALUATION
The clearest analogy to our research comes from research on
contingent valuation, in which people indicate the most they
would be willing to pay (WTP) for a public benet (e.g., environmental improvement). Of particular relevance to coherent arbitrariness is the nding that people’s willingness to pay for environmental amenities is remarkably unresponsive to the scope or
scale of the amenity being provided [Kahneman and Knetsch
1992]. For example, one study found that willingness to pay to
clean one polluted lake in Ontario was statistically indistinguishable from willingness to pay to clean all polluted lakes in Ontario
[Kahneman and Knetsch 1992].
Importantly, insensitivity to scale is most dramatic in studies
that employ between-subjects designs. When scope or scale is
varied within-subject, so that a single person is making judgments for different values, the valuations are far more responsive
to scale (see Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade [1999] and Kahneman, Schkade, and Sunstein [1998]).
This effect has even been observed in a study that examined
intuitive pricing of common household items. Frederick and
Fischhoff [1998] elicited WTPs for two different quantities of
common market goods (e.g., toilet paper, applesauce, and tuna
sh) using both a between-subjects design (in which respondents
valued either the small or large quantity of each good) and a
within-subjects design (in which respondents valued both the
small and large quantity of each good). The difference in WTP
was in the right direction in both designs, but it was much greater
(2.5 times as large) in the within-subjects condition, which explicitly manipulated quantity. This held true even for goods such as
toilet paper, for which the meaning of the quantity description
(number of rolls) should have been easy to evaluate. Frederick
and Fischhoff [p. 116] suggest that this would be a common
nding for valuation studies generally—that “valuations of any
particular quantity [of good] would be sensitive to its relative
position within the range selected for valuation, but insensitive to

<-----Page 26----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

99

which range is chosen, resulting in insensitive (or incoherent)
values across studies using different quantity ranges.” In fact, the
tendency for within-subject manipulations to produce larger effects than between subject manipulations is a common phenomenon (e.g., Fox and Tversky [1995], Kahneman and Ritov [1994],
and Keren and Raaijmakers [1988]).
XI. B. FINANCIAL MARKETS
Like the price one should ask to listen to an aversive tone, the
value of a particular stock is inherently ambiguous. As Shiller
[1998] comments, “Who would know what the value of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average should be? Is it really “worth” 6,000
today? Or 5,000 or 7,000? or 2,000 or 10,000? There is no agreedupon economic theory that would answer these questions.” In the
absence of better information, past prices (asking prices, prices of
similar objects, or other simple comparisons) are likely to be
important determinants of prices today. In a similar vein, Summers [1986] notes that it is remarkably difcult to demonstrate
that asset markets reect fundamental valuation. It is possible to
show that one or more prediction of the strong markets theory are
supported, but “the verication of one of the theory’s predictions
cannot be taken to prove or establish a theory” [p. 594]. Thus,
studies showing that the market follows a random walk are
consistent with fundamental valuation, but are insufcient to
demonstrate it; indeed, Summers presents a simple model in which
asset prices have a large arbitrary component, but are nevertheless
serially uncorrelated, as predicted by fundamental valuation.
While the overall value of the market or of any particular
company is inherently unknowable, the impact of particular
pieces of news is often quite straightforward. If Apple was expected to earn $x in a particular year but instead earned $2x, this
would almost unquestionably be very good news. If IBM buys
back a certain percentage of its own outstanding shares, this has
straightforward implications for the value of the remaining shares.
As Summers [1986] points out, the market may respond in a coherent, sensible fashion to such developments even when the absolute level of individual stocks, and of the overall market, is arbitrary.
XII. C. LABOR MARKETS
In the standard account of labor supply, workers intertemporally substitute labor and leisure with the goal of maximizing

<-----Page 27----->100

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

utility from lifetime labor, leisure, and consumption. To do so
optimally, they must have some notion of how much they value
these three activities, or at least of how much they value them
relative to one another. Although it is difcult to ascertain
whether labor supply decisions have an element of arbitrariness,
due to the absence of any agreed-upon benchmark, there is some
evidence of abnormalities in labor markets that could be attributed to arbitrariness. Summarizing results from a large-scale
survey of pay-setting practices by employees, Bewley [1998, p.
485] observes that “Non-union companies seemed to be isolated
islands, with most workers having little systematic knowledge of
pay rates at other rms. Pay rates in different nonunion companies were loosely linked by the forces of supply and demand, but
these allowed a good deal of latitude in setting pay.” Wage earners, we suspect, do not have a good idea of what their time is
worth when it comes to a trade-off between consumption and
leisure, and do not even have a very accurate idea of what they
could earn at other rms. Like players in the stock market, the
most concrete datum that workers have with which to judge the
correctness of their current wage rate is the rate they were paid
in the past. Consistent with this reasoning, Bewley continues,
“though concern about worker reaction and morale curbed pay
cutting, the reaction was to reduction in pay relative to its former
level. The fall relative to levels at other rms was believed to have
little impact on morale, though it might increase turnover.” In
other words, workers care about changes in salary but are relatively insensitive to absolute levels or levels relative to what
comparable workers make in other rms. This insensitivity may
help to explain the maintenance of substantial interindustry
wage differentials (see Dickens and Katz [1987], Krueger and
Summers [1988], and Thaler [1989]). Similarly, coherent arbitrariness is supported by the quip that a wealthy man is one who
earns $100 more than his wife’s sister’s husband.
XIII. D. CRIMINAL DETERRENCE
Imagine an individual who is contemplating committing a
crime, whether something as minor as speeding on a freeway, or
something as major as a robbery. To what extent will such an
individual be deterred by the prospect of apprehension? Research
on criminal deterrence has produced mixed answers to this question, with some studies nding signicant negative effects of

probability or severity of punishment on crime, and others reaching more equivocal conclusions. These studies have employed
different methodologies, with some examining cross-sectional differences in crime and punishment across states, and others examining changes over time. Coherent arbitrariness has important implications for these studies. Like many other types of
cost-benet calculations, assessing the probabilities and likely
consequences of apprehension is difcult, as is factoring such
calculations into one’s decision-making calculus. Thus, this is a
domain characterized by value uncertainty where one might expect to observe the coherent arbitrariness pattern. Coherent arbitrariness, in this case, would mean that people would respond
sensibly to well-publicized changes in deterrence levels but much
less to absolute levels of deterrence (for a discussion of similar
results in civil judgments see Sunstein, Kahneman, Schkade, and
Ritov [2002]). We would predict, therefore, that one should nd
short-term deterrence effects in narrowly focused studies that
examine the impact of policy changes, but little or no deterrence
effects in cross-sectional studies. This is, indeed, the observed
pattern. Interrupted time series studies have measured sizable
reactions in criminal behavior to sudden, well-publicized, increases in deterrence [Ross 1973; Sherman 1990], but these effects tend to diminish over time. The implication that we draw is
that the prevailing level of criminal activity does not reect any
underlying fundamental trade-off between the gains from crime
and the costs of punishment.
XIV. E. FINAL C OMMENTS
Our experiments highlight the general hazards of inferring
fundamental valuation by examining individuals’ responses to
change. If all one observed from our experiment was the relationship
between valuation and duration, one might easily conclude that
people were basing their WTA values on their fundamental valuation for the different stimuli. However, the effect of the arbitrary
anchor shows that, while people are adjusting their valuations in a
coherent, seemingly sensible, fashion to account for duration,
they are doing so around an arbitrary base value. Moreover, this
effect does not diminish as subjects gain more experience with the
stimulus or when they provide valuations in a market context.
A key economic implication of coherent arbitrariness is that
some economic variables will have a much greater impact than

<-----Page 29----->102

others. When people recognize that a particular economic variable, such as a price, has changed, they will respond robustly but
when the change is not drawn to their attention, they will respond more weakly, if at all. This point was recognized early on
by the economist John Rae who, [1834] noted that:
When any article rises suddenly and greatly in price, when in their
power, they are prone to adopt some substitute and relinquish the use of it.
Hence, were a duty at once imposed on any particular wine, or any particular
sort of cotton fabric, it might have the effect of diminishing the consumption
very greatly, or stopping it entirely. Whereas, were the tax at rst slight, and
then slowly augmented, the reasoning powers not being startled, vanity,
instead of ying off to some other objects, would be apt to apply itself to them
as affording a convenient means of gratication [page 374].

The speed at which an economic variable changes is only one
of many factors that will determine whether it is visible to individuals—whether it “startles” the reasoning powers, as Rae expressed it. Other factors that can make a difference are how the
information is presented, e.g., whether prices of alternative products are listed in a comparative fashion or are encountered sequentially (see Russo and Leclerc [1991]), and whether prices are
known privately or discussed. Thus, for example, large salary
differentials may be easier to sustain in a work environment in
which salary information is not discussed. In sum, changes or
differences in prices or other economic conditions will have a
much greater impact on behavior when people are made aware of
the change or difference than when they are only aware of the
prevailing levels at a particular point in time.
These results challenge the central premise of welfare economics that choices reveal true preferences—that the choice of A
over B indicates that the individual will in fact be better off with
A rather than with B. It is hard to make sense of our results
without drawing a distinction between “revealed” and “true” preferences. How, for example, can a pricing decision that is strongly
correlated with an individual’s social security number reveal a
true preference in any meaningful sense of the term? If consumers’ choices do not necessarily reect true preferences, but are to
a large extent arbitrary, then the claims of revealed preferences
as a guide to public policy and the organization of economic
exchange are weakened. Market institutions that maximize consumer sovereignty need not maximize consumer welfare.
As many economists have pointed out (e.g., Sen [1982]), the
sole psychological assumption underlying ordinal utility is that

<-----Page 30----->“COHERENT ARBITRARINESS”

103

people will behave consistently. Our work suggests that ordinal
utility may, in fact, be a valid representation of choices under
specic, albeit narrow, circumstances, without revealing underlying preferences, in any nonvacuous sense of “preference.” When
people are aware of changes in conditions, such as the change in
price in the example just given, they will respond in a coherent
fashion that mimics the behavior of individuals with xed, welldened, preferences. However, they will often not respond reasonably to new opportunities or to hidden changes in old variables, such as price or quality. The equilibrium states of the
economy may therefore contain a large arbitrary component,
created by historical accident or deliberate manipulation.
