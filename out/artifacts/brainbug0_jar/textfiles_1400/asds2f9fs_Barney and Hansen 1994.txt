Three types of trust in economic exchanges are identified: weak form trust, semi-strong
form trust, and strong form trust. It is shown that weak form trust can only be a source
of competitive advantage when competitors invest in unnecessary and expensive governance
mechanisms. Semi-strong form trust can be a source of competitive advantage when
competitors have differential exchange governance skills and abilities, and when these skills
and abilities are costly to imitate. The conditions under which strong form trust can be a
source of competitive advantage are also identified. Implications of this analysis for
theoretical and empirical work in strategic management are discussed.

incorrect (since most exchange partners are, in
fact, trustworthy), socially inefficient (since it
leads to an overinvestment in unnecessary
governance), and morally bankrupt (Etzioni,
1988). A more reasonable approach, it is argued,
would adopt the assumption that most exchange
partners are trustworthy, that they behave as
stewards over the resources they have under
their control (Donaldson and Davis, 1991), and
thus that trust in exchange relationships-even
without legal and contractual governance
protections-will be common.
On the other hand, more economically oriented
scholars respond by observing that, at the very
least, it is difficult to distinguish between exchange
partners that are actually trustworthy and those
that only claim to be trustworthy (Arrow, 1974;
Williamson, 1985). Since one cannot reliably
distinguish between these types of exchange
partners, legal and contractual protections are a
rational and effective means of assuring efficient
exchange. Trust, many economists would argue,
is in fact common in exchange relationships,

(Donaldson, 1990; Barney, 1990). While these
differences manifest themselves in a wide variety
of research contexts, no where are they more
obvious than in research on the role of trust in
economic exchanges.
On the one hand, behaviorally oriented
researchers often criticize economic models that
assume exchange partners are inherently untrustworthy (Mahoney, Huff, and Huff, 1993) and
constantly tempted to behave in opportunistic
ways (Donaldson, 1990). These scholars are
dissatisfied with economic analyses that suggest
trust will only emerge in an exchange when parties
to that exchange erect legal and contractual
protections (called governance mechanisms)
which make it in their self-interest to behave in
a trustworthy manner (Williamson, 1975). This
rational, calculative, economic approach to trust,
many behavioral scholars argue, is empirically

exchangepartnersare inherentlytrustworthyand
that legal or contractual governance is thus
unnecessaryare, at best, naive, and at worst,
foolish.
These debates about the role of trust in
exchange relationsips are interesting, in their
own right, but they are not terriblyrelevant for
strategic management research. Much of this
research focuses on understandingsources of
competitiveadvantagefor firms(Rumelt, Schendel, and Teece, 1991;Bowman, 1974). The effort
to understandsources of competitive advantage
leads strategy researchers to study differences
between firmsthat enable some firmsto conceive
of and implement valuable strategies that other
firms can either not conceive of and/or cannot
implement (Barney, 1991). Debates between
behavioraland economicallyorientedresearchers
about how trustworthyindividualsor firms are
fail to point to these kinds of differences.
Moreover, while the behavioral and economic
approaches suggest very different processes
through which trust emerges in economic
exchanges, both these approaches assert that
trustin economicexchangeswill be very common.

individualfirms (Barney, 1991). To be a source
of competitiveadvantage,trustmust be available
to only a few firmsin theirexchangerelationships,
not to most firmsin most exchange relationships
(Peteraf, 1993).
The purpose of this paper is to understandthe
conditionsunder which trust and trustworthiness
in exchangerelationshipscan, in fact, be a source
of competitive advantage for firms. The paper
begins by definingtrust, trustworthiness,and the
closely related concept of opportunism. Next,
three types of trust in exchange relationshipsare
defined and described: weak form trust, semistrong form trust, and strong form trust.1Then,
the conditionsunder which these different types
of trust will, and will not, be sources of
competitive advantage for firms are discussed.
The paper concludes with a discussion of some
of the empirical and theoretical implicationsof
the analysis.

DEFINING TRUST AND
TRUSTWORTHINESS
Numerous definitions of trust and trustworthiness
have been presented in the literature (Bradach
and Eccles, 1989; Gambetta, 1988; Lewicki and
Bunker, 1994). For purposes of this discussion,
Sabel's (1993: 1133) definition of trust has been
adopted: trust is the mutual confidence that no
party to an exchange will exploit another's
vulnerabilities.
Parties to an exchange can be vulnerable in
several different ways. For example, when parties
to an exchange find it very costly to evaluate
accurately the quality of the resources or assets
others assert they will bring to an exchange,
these economic actors are subject to adverse
selection vulnerabilities (Akerlof, 1970). When
parties to an exchange find it very costly to
evaluate accurately the quality of the resources
or assets others are actually offering in exchange,
these economic actors are subject to moral hazard
vulnerabilities (Holmstrom, 1979). Also, when
parties to an exchange make large, asymmetric
transaction-specific investments in an exchange,
they are subject to hold-up vulnerabilities (Klein,
Crawford, and Alchian, 1978). According to
Sabel, when parties to an exchange trust each
other, they share a mutual confidence that others
will not exploit any adverse selection, moral
hazard, hold-up, or any other vulnerabilities that
might exist in a particular exchange.
A definition of trustworthiness follows directly
from Sabel's definition of trust. As the word itself
implies, an exchange partner is trustworthy when
it is worthy of the trust of others. An exchange
partner worthy of trust is one that will not exploit
other's exchange vulnerabilities. Notice that while
trust is an attribute of a relationship between
exchange partners, trustworthiness is an attribute
of individual exchange partners.
In many ways, opportunism is the opposite of
trust. A firm's actions are opportunistic to the
extent that they take advantage of another's
exchange vulnerabilities. Williamson (1979)
emphasizes firms exploiting hold-up vulnerabilities of exchange partners, caused by asymmetric
transaction-specific investment. However, the
exploitation of other exchange vulnerabilities,
including adverse selection and moral hazard
vulnerabilities, can also be opportunistic in
nature.

<-----Page 3----->Trustworthiness and Competitive Advantage
TYPES OF TRUST
While trust is the mutual confidence that one's
vulnerabilities will not be exploited in an exchange,
different types of trust can exist in different
economic exchanges. These different types of trust
reflect different reasons parties to an exchange can
have the confidence that their vulnerabilities will
not be exploited. At least three types of trust can
be identified: weak from trust, semi-strong form
trust, and strong form trust.
Weak form trust: Limited opportunities for
opportunism
One reason that exchange partners can have the
mutual confidence that others will not exploit
their vulnerabilities is that they have no significant
vulnerabilities, at least in a particular exchange.
If there are no vulnerabilities, from adverse
selection, moral hazard, hold-up, or other
sources, then the trustworthiness of exchange
partners will be high, and trust will be the norm
in the exchange.
This type of trust can be called weak form
trust because its existence does not depend on
the erection of contractual or other forms of
exchange governance. Nor does its existence
depend on commitments by parties to an exchange
to trustworthy standards of behavior. Rather,
trust emerges in this type of exchange because
there are limited opportunities for opportunism.
Parties to an exchange, in this weak form context,
will gain all the benefits of being able to
trust their exchange partners without substantial
governance or other costs.
Of course, weak form trust is likely to emerge
in only very specific kinds of exchanges, i.e.,
exchanges where there are limited vulnerabilities.
In general, whenever the quality of goods or
services that are being exchanged can be evaluated
at low cost, and whenever exchange partners do
not need to make transaction-specific investments
to obtain gains from an exchange, vulnerabilities
in that exchange will be limited, and weak form
trust will be common. Easy-to-evaluate quality
effectively eliminates adverse selection and moral
hazard vulnerabilities; no transaction-specific
investments effectively eliminate hold-up vulnerabilities. Without vulnerabilities, opportunistic
behavior is unlikely, and weak form trustworthiness will exist.

177

In this sense, weak form trust is clearly
endogenous; i.e., it emerges out of a very specific
exchange structure. Of course, this exchange
structure can change and evolve over time. If an
exchange evolves such that the cost of evaluating
the quality of the goods or services in an
exchange increases, then adverse selection and/
or moral hazard vulnerabilities may emerge,
making weak form trust no longer possible. Also,
if transaction-specific investments develop over
time in an exchange, then hold-up vulnerabilities
may emerge, and weak form trust will no longer
exist.
Given this analysis, an important question
becomes: how often will weak form trustworthiness exist? While, ultimately, this is an empirical
question, it seems likely that weak form trust
will be the norm in highly competitive commodity
markets (Williamson, 1975). Examples of such
markets include the market for crude oil and the
market for soy beans. In all these markets, it is
relatively easy for buyers and sellers to evaluate
the quality of the goods or services they are
receiving (limited adverse selection and moral
hazard vulnerabilities). Moreover, in all these
markets, there are large numbers of equally
qualified buyers and sellers. Thus, firms do not
have to make transaction-specific investments to
trade with any one firm. Since parties to
exchanges in these kinds of markets are not
subject to significant exchange vulnerabilities,
weak form trustworthiness is usually the norm.
Of course, that a market was once a highly
competitive commodity market does not mean
that it will always be a highly competitive
commodity market. The cost of evaluating the
quality of goods or services can increase, the
number of buyers or suppliers can fall, and
significant exchange vulnerabilities can develop.
In this new exchange context, exchange partners
cannot rely on the emergence of weak form
trust, although other types of trust may develop.
Semi-strong form trust: Trust through
governance
When significant exchange vulnerabilities exist
(due to adverse selection, moral hazard, holdup, or other sources), trust can still emerge, if
parties to an exchange are protected through
various governance devices. Governance devices
impose costs of various kinds on parties to an

<-----Page 4----->178

exchange that behave opportunistically.If the
appropriategovernancedevices are in place, the
cost of opportunistic behavior will be greater
than its benefit, and it will be in the rational
self-interestof exchange partnersto behave in a
trustworthyway (Hill, 1990). In this context,
parties to an exchange will have the mutual
confidence that their vulnerabilitieswill not be
exploited because it would be irrational to do
so. This type of trust can be called semi-strong
form trust, and is the type of trust emphasized
in most economic models of exchange (Hill,
1990).
A wide range of governancedevices have been
described in the literature. Economists have
tended to focus on market-basedand contractual
governance devices. One market-basedgovernance device is the market for reputations(Klein
et al., 1978). Firms or individualsthat develop a
reputation for behaving opportunisticallywill
often be excluded from future economic
exchanges where exchange vulnerabilities are
significant. The cost of these opportunities
foregone can be substantial, and the avoidance
of these costs can lead exchange partnersto be
trustworthy in current exchanges, albeit in a
semi-strongway. Examples of more contractual
forms of governanceinclude complete contingent
claimscontracts,sequentialcontracting,strategic
and
hierarchical governance
alliances,
(Williamson,1985;Hennart, 1988;Kogut, 1988).
Contractualgovernance devices explicitly define
what constitutes opportunistic behavior in a
particularexchange, and specify the economic
costs that will be imposed on offending parties
(Williamson,1979).
Recently, this economicfocus on market-based
and contractual governance devices has been
criticized as being badly under socialized
(Granovetter, 1985). Several authors have suggested that a variety of social costs can also be
imposed on exchange partners that behave in
opportunistic ways. For example, a firm that
gains a reputation as a 'cheater' may bear
substantialeconomic opportunitycosts (Klein et
al., 1978), but it may also lose its social legitimacy
(DiMaggioand Powell, 1983). Also, Granovetter
(1985)has arguedthat exchangepartners,be they
individualsor firms,that are deeply embeddedin
social networks put those networks of relations
at risk when they engage in opportunistic
behavior. The imposition of these social costs

also acts to reduce the threat of opportunistic
behavior.
One implication of including governance
devices that impose social costs on opportunistic
exchange partners, instead of just economic costs,
is the expectation that opportunistic behavior will
be unusual, even in settings where few marketbased or contractual governance devices are in
place, as long as these more social forms of
governance exist (Granovetter, 1985). Even
some economists are beginning to recognize the
importance of these more socially oriented forms
of governance (Williamson, 1991). However,
while this more social approach to governance
broadens the range of governance devices that
should be studied, the trust that emerges among
parties to an exchange with these social governance mechanisms in place is of the same type as
the trust that emerges with only economic
governance devices in place. In both cases, trust
emerges because rational actors find it in their
self-interest, for both economic and social
reasons, not to behave opportunistically. Put
another way, neither economic nor behavioral
scholars would generally predict the emergence of
trust in exchanges where significant vulnerabilities
exist, and in which there are no market-based,
contractual, or social forms of governance.2 With
governance in place, however, trust-of the semistrong variety-may emerge, despite the existence
of significant exchange vulnerabilities.
Like weak form trust, semi-strong form trust
is endogenous; i.e., it emerges out of the structure
of a particular exchange. However, unlike weak
form trust, the structure of that exchange is
modified, in the semi-strong case, through the
use of governance devices of various types. If
parties to an exchange create and/or exploit the
correct governance devices, then opportunistic
behavior in that exchange will be unlikely, and
trust-albeit of the semi-strong variety-will
exist.
Of course, the creation and exploitation of
different forms of governance is not costless.
The costs of market-based and contractual forms
Granovetter (1985) would probably argue that relatively
few economic exchanges are not embedded in some broader
network of social relations. This, of course, is ultimately an
empirical question. However, Granovetter's theory suggests
that without some mechanism to impose social costs on those
that behave opportunistically, social governance will not
generate trust in a relationship.

The strongform trustworthinessof individuals
Whilethe existenceof strongformtrustworthiness
is, ultimately, an empirical question, research
from a variety of disciplines can be helpful in
answering the existence question. If exchange
partnersare individuals,then researchin developmental psychology suggests that strong form
trustworthinesscan exist in at least some people.
Developmentalpsychologistshave studied the
stages of moral development in children and
young adults (Kohlberg, 1969, 1971). These
stagesare summarizedin Table 1.4 Whenchildren
are very young (small babies), they are able to
make very few, if any, moral choices. In
this stage, decision making and behavior are
essentiallyamoral.However, as childrenmature,
they often have to decide whether or not to
conform their choices and behaviors to a set
of values, principles, and standards.S In the
conventional morality stage (Kohlberg, 1969),
childrenconform their choices and behaviorsto
a set of values, principles,and standardsin order
to avoid the costs imposed on them by others
for failing to do so. In this stage, children are
moral because the costs of being caughtviolating
principles and standards (i.e., punishment) are
too high. In the post conventionalmoralitystage,
choices and behaviors conform to a set of
values, principles, and standards because they
are internalized by individuals. While external
costs could still be imposed on choices and
behaviorsthat do not conformto these principles
and standards, avoiding these costs is not the
primarymotivation for moral behavior. Rather,
the primarymotivation for such behavior is to
avoid internallyimposed costs, includinga sense
of personal failure, guilt, and so forth.
Some obvious parallelsexist between the types
of trust and trustworthinessidentified here, and
the stages of moral development identified in
developmental psychology. These parallels are
identified in Table 1. The amoral stage in the
moral development literature is analogous to
weak formtrustworthiness.Just as youngchildren
cannot violate moral standards when they are

This is a simplification of the actual typology developed by
Kohlberg (1969, 1971). However, it is consistent with
Kohlberg's findings.
5 These values, standards, and principles are normally taken
from a child's parents or other caregivers (Kohlberg, 1969).

unable to make moral choices, individuals in
exchange relationships cannot act opportunistically when there are no opportunities to do
so. Conventional morality is analogous to semistrong form trustworthiness. In conventional
morality, individuals make choices to conform
their behavior to a set of principles and standards
in order to avoid the cost of failing to do so; in
semi-strong form trust, opportunistic behavior is
avoided because of the economic and social
costs imposed on such behavior by governance
mechanisms. Finally, post conventional morality
is analogous to strong form trustworthiness. In
both cases, choices and behavior conform to a
set of principles and standards because those
principles and standards have been internalized.
While external costs may be imposed on individuals that violate these principles and standards,
avoiding these external costs is not the primary
reason choices and behavior conform to them.
Rather, the avoidance of internally imposed
costs-including a sense of personal failure and
guilt-provide the primary motivation for this
type of principled behavior.
Psychologists have shown that postconventional
morality is not uncommon (Kohlberg, 1971).
While some people never mature beyond the
amoral or conventional morality stages, many
have sets of values, principles, and standards
that they use to guide their choices and behaviors.
In order for postconventional morality to lead to
strong form trustworthiness, all that is additionally
required is that some of these values, principles,
and standards suggest that exploiting an exchange
partners vulnerabilities is inappropriate.
The strong form trustworthiness of firms
At the individual level, the existence of strong
form trustworthiness in at least some people
seems plausible. However, that individuals-as
exchange partners-can be strong form trustworthy does not necessarily imply that firms-as
exchange partners-can be strong form trustworthy. Firms, as exchange partners, can be
strong form trustworthy for at least two reasons.
Either a firm may possess a culture and associated
control systems that reward strong form trustworthy behavior, or the specific individuals
involved in a particular exchange may, themselves, be strong form trustworthy.
Zucker (1987) has shown that firm founders

can have a very strong impact on the culture
and other institutional attributes of firms. This
impact can continue, even if these individuals
have been dead for many years. Others, besides
founders, can also have these strong cultural and
institutional effects. For example, transformational leaders (Tichy and Devanna, 1986) can
have the effect of re-creating a firm's culture and
fundamentally changing other of its institutional
attributes.
If these influential individuals were themselves
strong form trustworthy, they may have created
an organizational culture characterized by strong
form trustworthy values and beliefs. These strong
form trustworthy values and beliefs may also be
supported and reinforced by internal reward and
compensation systems, together with decisionmaking mechanisms that reflect strong form
trustworthy standards. A firm with these cultural
and institutional mechanisms in place will often
behave in a strong form trustworthy manner in
exchange relationships.
Notice that, if a firm has a strong form
trustworthy culture and associated control mechanisms, it is not necessary for each individual in
a firm to be strong form trustworthy. Rather, all
that is required is that individuals in a firm be
at least self-interested in their behavior. In this
situation, individuals in a firm will find it in
their self-interest to behave in a strong form
trustworthy way, when representing the firm, for
failure to do so would lead them to be subject
to a variety of social and economic sanctions.
Individuals who are unable to conform themselves

to a firm's strong form trustworthy standards
have several options, including, for example,
finding positions in the firm where trustworthiness
issues are not likely to arise, or changing firms.
Of course, that a firm once had a culture, and
associated internal control mechanisms, that
encouraged strong form trustworthiness does not
mean that it will always have these attributes.
Cultures can evolve, control mechanisms can
change, and a firm may no longer have the
attributes to qualify as strong form trustworthy.
However, even when firms do not have strong
form trustworthiness cultures, it still may be
possible for some of the exchanges in which a
firm engages to be characterized by strong form
trust.
Exchanges between firms are, more often then
not, actually exchanges between small groups of
individuals in different firms. For example, when
an automobile company signs a supply agreement
with a supplier, the two groups of individuals
most directly involved in this agreement are the
purchasing people, in the automobile company,
and the sales people, in the supply company.
When two firms agree to form an equity joint
venture, several groups of people are directly
involved, including those in each parent firm
that are assigned the responsibility to interact
with the joint venture, and those that work in
the joint venture itself.
While the firms in these exchanges may not
have strong form trustworthy cultures, the specific
individuals that are most directly involved in
these exchanges may, themselves, be strong form

<-----Page 8----->182

trustworthy. Exchanges between strong form
trustworthy individuals in different firms can lead
to strong form trust, even though the firms,
themselves, may not be strong form trustworthy.6

TRUST AND COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE
Trust can emerge in economic exchanges in any
of the three ways discussed. However, these
three types of trust are not equally likely to be
sources of competitive advantage. A strategic
analysis of trust and trustworthiness focuses
attention on the conditions under which a
particular type of trust will be a source of
competitive advantage.
Weak form trust and competitive advantage
The exchange attributes that make weak form
trust possible suggest that weak form trust will
usually not be a source of competitive advantage.
As suggested earlier, weak form trust is most
likely to emerge in highly competitive commodity
markets. It is well known that exchange partners
in highly competitive commodity markets can
expect to gain few, if any, competitive advantages
(Porter, 1980). In particular, while those participating in these markets will be able to rely on
the existence of weak form trust in their exchange
relationships, the advantages of weak form trust
will accrue to all exchange partners in these
markets equally, thereby giving no one of them
a competitive advantage.
Indeed, one of the few ways those trading in
these markets can expect to gain advantages
from weak form trust is if some competitors fail
to rely on weak form trust and, indeed, invest
in unnecessary and costly governance devices to
create semi-strong form trust. Both those that
rely on weak form and semi-strong form trust,
in these highly competitive commodity markets,
6 Conflicts between individual and firm values, in this context,

act as a constraint on the ability of strong form trustworthy
individuals to engage in strong form trust exchanges.
However, strong form trustworthy individuals can be expected
to engage in a variety of activities to neutralize the nonstrong form trustworthy effects of the firm within which they
operate. Moreover, the firm has strong incentives to let the
strong form trustworthy individuals continue in strong form
trust exchanges, since it gains all the advantages of these
exchanges.

can expect trust to exist in their exchange
relationships. However, those that invest in
governance to generate semi-strong form trust
will have higher costs, compared to those that
rely on weak form trust. Over time, those
that have invested in unnecessary (and costly)
governance will either abandon those governance
devices or suffer from competitive disadvantages.
Put differently, the cost advantage of those
that rely on weak form trust over those that rely
on semi-strong form trust, in these highly
competitive conditions, is a measure of the
economic value of weak form trust. However, if
numerous competitors are all able to obtain this
value at the same low cost, then it will not be a
source of competitive advantage to any one of
them (Barney, 1991).
Semi-strong form trust and competitive
advantage
Semi-strong form trust in exchange relationships
is economically valuable, in the sense that its
creation assures parties to an exchange that their
vulnerabilities will not be exploited. However,
the ability to create semi-strong form trust in
economic exchanges depends on several
important governance skills and abilities that
parties to an exchange must possess. For example,
for semi-strong form trust to emerge, exchange
partners must be able accurately to anticipate
sources and levels of opportunistic threat in the
exchanges in which they may participate. Also, to
create semi-strong form trust, exchange partners
must be able to rely on existing social governance
mechanisms and/or to conceive of, implement,
and manage the appropriate market-based and
contractual governance mechanisms. Only if
exchange partners can accomplish these tasks
will the 'right' types of governance be chosen to
create semi-strong form trust, and will the value
of semi-strong form trust be realized.
However, for semi-strong form trust to be a
source of competitive advantage, there must be
heterogeneity in the exchange governance skills
and abilities of competing firms (Barney, 1991).
If most competing firms or individuals have
similar governance skills and abilities, they will
all be equally able to create the conditions under
which semi-strong form trust will emerge in their
exchange relationships. Moreover, the cost of
creating semi-strong form trust will also not

<-----Page 9----->Trustworthiness and Competitive Advantage
vary dramatically across these equally skilled
competitors. Since these competitors do not vary
in their exchange governance skills, no one of
them will be able to gain a competitive advantage
based on the semi-strong form trust that they
are able to create with these skills.7
Of course, there is no reason to believe, a
priori, that competing exchange partners will be
equally skilled or able in creating the conditions
necessary for semi-strong form trust. For example, some exchange partners may have developed
a high degree of skill in managing, say, intermediate market forms of governance (e.g., equity
joint ventures). These highly skilled actors may
be able to create semi-strong form trust using
these intermediate market forms of governance
in economic exchanges where less skilled actors
may be forced to use hierarchical forms of
governance. If intermediate market forms of
governance are, in fact, less costly than hierarchical forms of governance, those that obtain
semi-strong form trust through intermediate
market forms will have a competitive advantage
over those that must obtain trust in that exchange
through hierarchical forms of governance. Similar
reasoning could apply to those that are highly
skilled in managing contractual forms of governance (e.g., complete contingent claims contracts)
compared to those that are only able to use
more costly intermediate market forms of governance or hierarchical forms of governance.
Heterogeneity in the skills and ability to create
semi-strong form trust in an exchange may
also reflect important social differences among
competing exchange partners. For example, if a
particular firm is contemplating an exchange with
another firm, where that relationship is deeply
embedded in a large complex network of social
relations, these firms may be able to rely
on (relatively inexpensive) social governance
mechanisms to develop semi-strong form trust.
On the other hand, if a competing firm is
anticipating a similar exchange that is not deeply

7 Competing exchange partners do not have to erect the

same governance mechanisms for semi-strong trust to generate
competitive parity. Rather, all that is required is that
competing exchange partners erect functionally equivalent
governance devices (i.e., governance devices that generate
the same level of semi-strong form trust) and that these
governance devices are about equally costly. These arguments
also apply to bundles of governance devices to create semistrong form trust.

183

embedded in this broader social network of
relations, parties to this exchange may have
to rely on (more costly) economic forms of
governance to ensure semi-strong form trust.
The firm that can rely on social governance to
generate semi-strong form trust will have a costbased competitive advantage over the firm that
must rely on economic governance to generate
semi-strong form trust.
Heterogeneity in governance skills and abilities
is an important explanation of variance in a
wide variety of different economic exchanges.
Compare, for example, the exchanges between
Toyota and its suppliers, on the one hand, and
General Motors and its suppliers (Dyer and
Ouchi, 1993; Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990),
on the other. Toyota's supply relationships are
deeply embedded in long-standing networks of
social and economic relationships. These social
governance mechanisms have enabled both Toyota and its suppliers to engage in very vulnerable
exchanges (due to high transaction-specific investments that lead to a high risk of hold-up) with
substantially less contractual or other forms of
governance than is the case at General Motors
(GM). Without the ability to rely on social
embeddedness to constrain the opportunistic
behavior of its suppliers, GM has had to reduce
the threat of opportunism by reducing the level
of transaction-specific investment in its suppliers
(i.e., by having multiple competing suppliers),
by insisting on elaborate contractual protections,
or by vertically integrating the supply relationship
(Dyer and Ouchi, 1993; Womack et al., 1990).
Overall, the cost of creating semi-strong form
trust at Toyota has been substantially lower than
the cost of creating semi-strong form trust at
GM.8

Of course, if several competitors all possess
these special governance skills and abilities to
approximately the same level, then they will not
be a source of competitive advantage for any
one of them, even if there are some competitors
that do not possess these skills. However, as
long as the number of competitors that have
these special governance skills and abilities is
less than what is required to generate perfect
competition dynamics, then they can be a source
8 Obviously, there may be some strong form trustworthiness
attributes to Toyota's relationships with its suppliers that do
not exist between GM and its suppliers.

<-----Page 10----->184

J. B. Barney and M.H. Hansen

of competitive advantagefor those that possess
them (Barney, 1991).
Moreover, if these skills and abilities can
rapidly diffuse among competitors, they will
be the source of only temporary competitive
advantages.However, it seems likely that these
skills and abilitieswill not rapidlydiffusethrough
most populations. For example, the ability to
rely on social governancemechanismsin different
exchanges depends upon the structure of the
network of relations within which an exchange
is embedded. Those networks of relations, in
turn, are developed over long perods of time,
and are unique to a particularpoint in history.
Such path-dependent(Arthur, 1989) phenomena
are subject to time compression diseconomies
(Dierickx and Cool, 1989), and thus costly to
imitate. The development of special governance
skills is also path dependent. Moreover, these
skills are often socially complex, and thus costly
to imitate (Barney, 1991).
Whenever exchange partnerspossess rare and
costly-to-imitategovernance skills and abilities,
they may be able to use those abilities to gain
competitive advantages in creating semi-strong
form trust. On the other hand, when competing
exchange partners possess similar governance
skills and abilities, the creation of semi-strong
trust will generate only competitive parity.
Strong form trust and competitiveadvantage
For strong form trustworthinessto be economically valuable, all those with a significantstake
in an exchangemust be strong form trustworthy.
If one or more parties to an exchange may
behave opportunisticallyin that exchange, then
all parties to that exchange will need to invest
in a variety of social and economic governance
mechanisms to insure semi-strong form trust.
Any potential economic advantages of being
strong form trustworthy are irrelevant when
semi-strong form governance protections are
erected and exploited, since strong form trustworthy parties are forced to behave as if they
were only semi-strongform trustworthy.
Economic opportunitiesin strongform trust
exchanges
On the other hand, if all those with a significant
stake in an exchangeare strongform trustworthy,

some important and valuable economic opportunities may exist. These opportunities reflect
either the governance cost advantages that strong
form trust exchanges may enjoy over semi-strong
form trust exchanges and/or the ability that
strong form trustworthy exchange partners may
have to explore exchange options not available to
semi-strong form trustworthy exchange partners.
When two or more strong form trustworthy
individuals or firms engage in an exchange, they
can all be assured that any vulnerabilities that
might exist in this exchange will not be exploited
by their partners. Moreover, this assurance comes
with no additional investment in social or
economic forms of governance. As long as the
cost of developing and maintaining strong form
trustworthiness in an individual or firm, plus the
cost of discovering strong form trustworthy
partners, is less than the cost of exploiting or
creating semi-strong form governance devices,
those engaging in a strong form trustworthy
context will gain a cost advantage over those
exchanging in a semi-strong trustworthy context.
Consider, for example, several competing firms
looking to purchase raw materials from a set of
suppliers. Suppose that a small number of these
buyers and sellers are strong form trustworthy,
and that there are some significant exchange
vulnerabilities in this raw materials purchase. In
order to complete this purchase, those purchasing
from semi-strong suppliers will need to rely on
and/or erect a variety of social or economic
governance devices. While these governance
devices are costly, their existence will enable
firms to purchase the raw material in question.
On the other hand, strong form trustworthy
buyers purchasing from strong form trustworthy
suppliers will not have to rely on or erect social
or economic forms of governance in order to
complete their purchase of the raw material. As
long as the cost of developing and maintaining
strong form trustworthiness, plus the cost of
discovering strong form trustworthy exchange
partners, is less than the cost of relying on or
erecting social or economic governance devices,
the firms purchasing raw materials in a strong
form trust exchange will have a cost advantage
over those firms purchasing raw materials in a
semi-strong trust exchange.9
9 While ultimately an empirical question, it seems likely
that the cost of creating and maintaining strong form

<-----Page 11----->Trustworthiness and Competitive Advantage
Perhaps even more important than this governance cost advantage, those engaging in strong
form trust exchanges may be able to exploit
exchange opportunities that are not available to
those who are only able to engage in semi-strong
form trust exchanges. It has already been
suggested that valuable semi-strong form
exchanges will not be pursued when the cost of
governance needed to generate semi-strong form
trust is greater than the expected gains from
trade. This can happen when the expected gains
from trade are small (but modest vulnerabilities in
this exchange require modest levels of expensive
governance) or when the expected gains from
trade are substantial (but very large vulnerabilities
in this exchange require very substantial levels
of costly governance). While semi-strong form
trust exchanges will not be pursued in these
situations, it may be possible to pursue strong
form trust exchanges. In this sense, strong form
trustworthiness may increase the set of exchange
opportunities available to an individual or firm,
compared to those who are only semi-strong
form trustworthy (Zajac and Olsen, 1993; Ring
and Van de Ven, 1994).
Consider, for example, several competing firms
looking to cooperate with one or more of several
other firms in the development and exploitation
of a new, and sophisticated, technology. Suppose
that only a small number of these two sets of
firms are strong form trustworthy, that the
technology in question has significant economic
potential, but that there are enormous exchange
vulnerabilities in the technology development
process. Semi-strong form trustworthy firms, in
this setting, will need to invest in substantial
amounts of costly governance to try to create
semi-strong form trust. It may even be the case
that no form of governance will create semistrong form trust (Grossman and Hart, 1986).
The potential economic return that could be
obtained from this exchange will need to be
reduced by an amount equal to the present value

trustworthiness, plus the cost of discovering strong form
trustworthy exchange partners, will often be less than the
cost of relying on or erecting semi-strong governance
devices. The cost of creating and maintaining strong form
trustworthiness can be spread across numerous economic
exchanges, thus reducing the per exchange cost. The cost of
discovering strong form trustworthy exchange partners can
be reduced through the discovery and signalling mechanisms
described below.

185

of the cost of governing this exchange. Moreover,
the present value of this exchange will also have
to be discounted by any residual threat of
opportunism. The reduced value of this exchange
could lead semi-strong form trustworthy firms to
decide not to pursue it, even though substantial
economic value may exist.
On the other hand, exchanges of this sort
between strong form trustworthy firms are
burdened neither by the high cost of governance
nor any residual threat of opportunism. Strong
form trustworthy firms will be able to pursue
these valuable, but highly vulnerable exchanges,
while semi-strong form trustworthy firms will be
unable to pursue them. This may represent a
substantial opportunity cost for semi-strong form
trustworthy exchange partners, and a source of
competitive advantage for strong form trustworthy exchange partners.'10
Traditional transactions cost logic suggests
that, when faced with these valuable but highly
vulnerable exchanges, exchange partners will opt
for hierarchical forms of governance and use
managerial fiat as a way to manage trustworthiness problems (Williamson, 1985). However,
hierarchical governance is not always a solution
to these problems. First, there may be important
legal and political restrictions on the use of
hierarchical governance. For example, one cannot
acquire a direct competitor if such actions
lead to unacceptably high levels of industry
concentration. Also, firms may be required,
for political reasons, to maintain market or
intermediate market relationships with an
exchange partner (e.g., when entering into a
new country market).
Second, as Grossman and Hart (1986) suggest,
hierarchical governance does not necessarily
'solve' opportunism problems. Rather it simply
shifts those problems from a market or intermediate market context to inside the boundaries of
the firm. Where, in market-based exchanges,
firms face the threat of opportunism in exchanges
with other firms, bringing these transactions
within the boundaries of a firm can simply lead
to division facing the threat of opportunism in

10 As previously, it seems likely that the cost of creating and
maintaining strong form trustworthiness, plus the cost of
discovering strong form trustworthy exchange partners, will
be less than the opportunity cost of relying only on semistrong form trust governance devices.

<-----Page 12----->186

J.B. Barney and M.H. Hansen

exchanges with other divisions. Put differently,
hierarchicalgovernance does not automatically
create strongform trust exchange (Ouchi, 1980).
Wherehierarchicalgovernancemay not always
be a solution to the threat of opportunism,
exchanges between strong form trustworthy
exchangepartners-whether those exchangesare
within the boundary of a single firm or notwill, in general, create strong form trust. Strong
form trustworthyindividualsor firms will often
be able to gain governancecost advantagesover
semi-strongform trustworthyindividualsor firms.
Moreover, strong form trustworthyindividuals
or firmswill often be able to engage in economic
exchanges that cannot be pursued by semistrong form trustworthyexchange partners. Put
differently, the level of vulnerability in some
economic exchanges may be greater than the
ability of any standard governance devices to
protect against the threat of opportunism.The
only way to pursue these exchanges is through
strong form trustworthiness.
Of course, if most competitorsare strongform
trustworthy,and engage in exchangeswith others
that are also strong form trustworthy,then the
advantagesof strong form trustworthinesswould
only be a source of competitive parity, and
not competitive advantage. However, while the
number of strong form trustworthy exchange
partnersin a particularsegment of the economy
is ultimatelyan empiricalquestion, it seems like
a reasonableguess that strong form trustworthiness in at least some segments of the economy
is probablyrare, and thus (assumingexchanges
with other strong form trustworthy exchange
partners are developed) at least a source of
temporarycompetitiveadvantagefor strongform
trustworthyindividualsand firms.
Locatingstrongform trustworthyexchange
partners
Given the importantcompetitiveadvantagesthat
may attend exchanges between strong form
trustworthy exchange partners, an important
question becomes: how can strong form trustworthy exchange partnersrecognize each other?
This process is problematic, since exchange
partners that are not strong form trustworthy
have a strong incentive to assert that they are.
If a strong form trustworthyindividual or firm
believes that an exchange partneris strong form

trustworthy, even though this partner is not, then
that strong form trustworthy individual or firm will
be willing to engage in a highly vulnerable exchange
without social or economic governance devices.
Without these devices in place, the untrustworthy
exchange partner could exploit the strong form
trustworthy partner's exchange vulnerabilities with
impunity. Thus, simple assertions that one is strong
form trustworthy are not sufficient justification for
assuming that an exchange partner is, in fact,
strong form trustworthy.
Of course, a simple solution to this adverse
selection problem would be to observe directly
whether or not a potential exchange partner is
stong form trustworthy, and respond appropriately. Unfortunately, the individual and organizational attributes that create strong form trustworthiness are difficult to observe directly. At
an individual level, the values, principles, and
standards around which strong form trustworthy
individuals organize their lives are clearly not
directly observable. At the firm level, an organization's culture, and associated control systems,
may be difficult to observe, and their implications
for individual behavior ambiguous-at least to
those not deeply embedded in this culture and
control system. Moreover, if the development of
strong form trust depends on the strong form
trustworthiness of small groups of people in a
larger organization, evaluating the individual
values, principles, and standards of these people
remains difficult.
Even with these challenges, strong form trustworthy exchange partners can still be found. It
will often be the case, for example, that exchange
partners will begin a relationship assuming that
others are at least semi-strong form trustworthy.
As this relationship evolves overtime, parties to
an exchange may be able to gain sufficient
information to judge accurately whether or not
others are strong form trustworthy. If two or
more parties to an exchange discover that they
are strong form trustworthy, any subsequent
exchanges between these parties can generate
strong form trust, and these exchange partners
will subsequently obtain all the advantages of
strong form trustworthiness. On the other hand,
if experience shows that an exchange partner is
only semi-strong form trustworthy, then future
exchanges with this partner will continue with
semi-strong form trust generating governance
mechanism in place.

<-----Page 13----->Trustworthiness and Competitive Advantage
Notice that this process of discovering strong
form trustworthy exchange partners assumes that
one's trustworthiness type does not automatically
change as a result of experience in a semi-strong
form trust relationship. If the creation of semistrong trust exchanges inevitably led exchange
partners to become strong form trustworthy, then
all exchanges would inevitably be characterized by
strong form trust, and strong form trustworthiness
would not be a source of competitive advantage
to any individual or firm. Rather than changing
an exchange partner's trustworthiness type, the
creation of a semi-strong form trust exchange
creates an opportunity for exchange partners to
observe more directly another's trustworthiness
type. While it is certainly true that an exchange
partner's trustworthiness type may evolve over
the long run, the historical, path-dependent,
socially complex, and causally ambiguous nature
of strong form trustworthiness makes it unlikely
that semi-strong form trustworthy firms will be
able to become strong form trustworthy in the
short and medium term.
This search for potential strong form trustworthy exchange partners can be shortened
through the use of signals of strong form
trustworthiness (Spence, 1973). Signals of strong
form trustworthiness must have two properties:
(1) they must be correlated with the underlying
(but costly to observe) actual level of strong
form trustworthiness in a potential exchange
partner; and (2) they must be less costly to
exchange partners that are actually strong form
trustworthy than they are to exchange partners
that only claim they are strong form trustworthy
(Spence, 1973).
Several behaviors by exchange partners qualify
as signals for strong form trustworthiness. For
example, a reputation for being strong form
trustworthy is a signal of strong form trustworthiness." Gaining a reputation as a strong form
trustworthy exchange partner occurs, over time,
as an exchange partner confronts situations where
opportunistic behavior is possible, but chooses
not to engage in opportunistic activities. There
11 Note that having a reputation for being strong form
trustworthy is not the same as not having a reputation for
being opportunistic. A potential exchange partner may not
have a reputation for being opportunistic (i.e., they may not
be known as a 'cheater') but still not have a reputation for
being strong form trustworthy (i.e., they may not be known
as 'hard-core' trustworthy).

187

are no opportunity costs associated with a strong
form trustworthy individual or firm not behaving
opportunistically, since such behavior is not in
this kind of exchange partner's opportunity set.
On the other hand, a nonstrong form trustworthy
exchange partner will have to absorb opportunity
costs each time they decide not to behave in an
opportunistic way. These opportunity costs make
it more costly for an exchange partner that is not
strong form trustworthy to develop a reputation as
strong form trustworthy, compared to an
exchange partner that is actually strong form
trustworthy.
While a reputation for being strong form
trustworthy is a signal of strong form trustworthiness, it is noisy. In particular, this reputation
cannot distinguish between those exchange partners that are actually strong form trustworthy,
and those that are not strong form trustworthy,
but have yet to engage in an exchange where
returns to opportunistic behavior are large enough
to motivate opportunistic behavior. While a
reputation for being strong form trustworthy
does eliminate those exchange partners who have
acted opportunistically, it does not eliminate
those exchange partners who might act opportunistically, given the right incentives.
Another signal of strong form trustworthiness
is being open to outside auditing of the exchange
relationship. This is less costly to strong form
trustworthy exchange partners, compared to
those that are not strong form trustworthy, since
trustworthy exchange partners were not going to
behave opportunistically anyway. One would
expect to see strong form trustworthy firms and
individuals to be very open to outside auditors,
perhaps even paying the cost of outside auditors
chosen by potential exchange partners.
A third signal of strong form trustworthiness
might be to make unilateral transaction-specific
investments in an exchange before that exchange
is actually in place. Gulati, Khana, and Nohria
(1994) have found, for example, that it is not
uncommon for firms with a strong track record
of successfully engaging in joint ventures to sign
long-term third-party supply contracts that are
only valuable if a particular joint venture actually
goes forward-before that joint venture agreement is complete. Such unilateral transactionspecific investments are less costly to strong form
trustworthy firms, since they were not going to
behave in an opportunistic manner in developing

<-----Page 14----->188

J. B. Barney and M.H. Hansen

this joint venture anyway. These investments
foreclose opportunistic opportunities for firms
that are not strong form trustworthy,and thus
represent significantopportunity costs to these
firms. If all those involved in an exchange
independently make these kinds of unilateral
transaction-specificinvestments, then others in
these exchanges can conclude, with some
reliability,that they are strong form trustworthy.
If strongform trustworthinessis relativelyrare
among a set of competitors, and if two or more
strong form trustworthyexchange partners are
able to engage in trade, then these strong form
trustworthy individuals or firms will gain at
least a temporary competitive advantage over
individuals or firms that are not strong form
trustworthy.For this competitive advantage to
remain, however, the individual and organizational attributes that make strong form trustworthinesspossible must also be costly to imitate
and immune from rapid diffusion. Fortunately,
the individualand organizationalattributesthat
make strong form trustworthinesspossible (i.e.,
individualvalues, principles, and standards;an
organization's culture and associated control
system) reflect an exchange partner's unique
path throughhistory (path dependence) and are
sociallycomplex. As was suggestedearlier, these
types of individualand organizationalattributes
are usually immune from imitation and rapid
diffusion among competitors (Barney, 1991;
Arthur, 1989; Dierickx and Cool, 1989).12
DISCUSSION
Trust, in economic exchanges, can be a source
of competitive advantage. However, trust in
these exchanges is not always a source of
competitive advantage. Weak form trust is only
a competitiveadvantagewhen competitorsinvest
in unnecessary and costly semi-strong form
12
Given the challenge of discovering strong form trustworthy
exchange partners, these relationships are likely to be
relatively stable over time. Indeed, it may well be the case
that exchanges between strong form trustworthy partners
may continue, even though they have limited potential for
generating current economic value (Ring and Van de Ven,
1994). In this setting, the challenge facing exchange partners
is to discover new ways to generate economic value with
older, stable, relationships. Even when this cannot be done,
economically nonviable exchanges may continue for some
time because of the close relationships between partners.

governance mechanisms. Semi-strong form trust
is only a source of competitive advantage when
a small number of competitors have special skills
and abilities in conceiving of and implementing
social and economic governance devices, and
when those skills and abilities are immune from
low-cost imitation. Strong form trust is a source
of competitive advantage when two or more
strong form trustworthy individuals or firms
engage in an exchange, when strong form
trustworthiness is relatively rare among a set
of competitors, and when the individual and
organizational attributes that lead to strong
form trustworthiness are immune from low-cost
imitation.
This analysis has important implications for
research in organization theory and strategic
management. For example, these ideas can be
seen as an extension of transactions cost theoryan extension that makes this form of analysis
strategically more relevant. Where transactions
cost economics implicitly assumes that the skills
and abilities needed to conceive of and implement
governance mechanisms are constant across individuals and firms (Williamson, 1985), this
approach suggests that these skills and abilities
may vary in some strategicially important ways.
Also, where transactions cost theory assumes
either that all potential exchange partners are
equally likely to behave opportunistically or that
one cannot distinguish between those that will
behave opportunistically and those that will not
behave opportunistically (Williamson, 1985), this
analysis suggests that potential exchange partners'
opportunistic tendencies may vary, and that these
differences can be discovered. Discovery of
exchange partners that will not engage in
opportunistic behavior enables firms to gain all
the advantages of trade, without the cost of
governance.
Thus, consistent with many of the more
behaviorally oriented organizational scholars
cited earlier, the approach in this paper rejects
both the assumption that all exchange partners
are likely to engage in opportunistic behavior
and the assumption that it is not possible to
know how opportunistic a particular exchange
partner is likely to be. However, these transactions cost assumptions are not replaced by
equally extreme, if opposite, assumptions that
most exchange partners are trustworthy most of
the time. Rather, the approach adopted here is

<-----Page 15----->Trustworthiness and Competitive Advantage
that the trustworthiness of exchange partners can
vary, and that how trustworthy an exchange
partner is can be discovered. The adoption of
this approach leads to the conclusion that, in
some circumstances, trust can be a source of
competitive advantage-a conclusion that is not
possible if it is assumed that most exchange
partners are either untrustworthy or that most
exchange partners are trustworthy.
This analysis also points to two important
exchange processes that have not received sufficient attention in the organizations and strategy
literatures. First, the argument suggests that
semi-strong form trust can be a source of
competitive advantage if competing exchange
partners vary in their skills and abilities in
conceiving of and implementing governance
mechanisms. What these specific skills and
abilities might be, and why they might develop
in some economic actors and not others, are
unexplored issues in this paper. Casual observation suggests that, for example, some firms
seem to be better at managing certain kinds of
governance devices than others. Corning seems
to be able to manage joint ventures more
effectively than, say, TRW (Sherman, 1992).
Toyota seems to be able to manage complex
supply relationships more effectively than GM
(Dyer and Ouchi, 1993; Womack et al., 1990).
How these different skills and abilities evolve,
and their competitive implications, are important
research questions. In this context, comparative
research on semi-strong form governance in
different industries and different countries is
likely to be very important (Dyer and Ouchi,
1993).
Second, the argument suggests that strong
form trustworthy exchange partners may be
able to discover other strong form trustworthy
exchange partners. Once discovered, these kinds
of exchange partners can gain important competitive advantages from working with each other.
However, much more empirical work needs to
focus on the process through which strong form
trustworthiness evolves in an economic actor.
Such empirical work will establish whether or
not strong form trustworthiness is a relatively
stable attribute of economic actors, and whether
or not this attribute can be imitated at low cost.
Also, empirical research needs to focus on the
process of searching for strong form trustworthy
exchange partners. In particular, the role of

189

signals of strong form trustworthiness deserves
special empirical attention. In this context, it
may be helpful to compare the decisions and
behaviors of firms that have been able to develop
many strong form trustworthy exchanges (e.g.,
Corning) with the decisions and behaviors of
firms that have been unable to develop these
strong form trustworthy exchanges.
By examining the competitive implications of
different types of trust in economic exchanges,
it becomes clear that extreme assumptions about
potential exchange partners-that most are trustworthy and that most are opportunistic-are
overly simplistic. Rather, the trustworthiness of
exchange partners may vary, and in that variance
the possibility of competitive advantage may
exist.
