<-----Page 2----->Abstract
This research investigates the relationship between those incentives for faculty support of universityindustry technology transfer that are governed by university intellectual property policies and
technology transfer outcomes at Canadian universities.
Empirical research, chiefly conducted in the United States, has explored the link between the
incentives that are governed by IP policies and various outcomes and found that financial incentives
are correlated with a variety of outcomes. This research extends the literature by exploring the same
underlying relationship, in Canada, where IP policies also determine ownership and control of the
development of the IP; some universities retain control over the development and other universities
let the ownership and control vest with the inventors.
The research question was pursued by conducting three studies, each of which provided a different
perspective. The first study seeks to explain cross-institutional patterns in the numbers of patents
held by Canadian universities using variables that represent the financial incentives and control
offered to faculty inventors by the universities’ policies. The second study investigated the impact of
a policy change at the University of Toronto, using interrupted time series analysis techniques. The
third study investigated the experiences of faculty inventors at the University of Waterloo through indepth interviews and thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data.
The first, cross-sectional study failed to generate statistically significant results. In the second,
longitudinal study, the change from a “university-owns” to an “inventor-owns” policy appeared to
have significantly and substantially increased the number of invention disclosures submitted to the
University of Toronto by its faculty members. The third, qualitative study suggests that faculty
members interpret the incentives governed by intellectual property policies and that this interpretation
is shaped by group norms, academic leadership, university culture and the inventors’ experiences with
technology transfer support organizations. Therefore, Studies 2 and 3 indicate that university
intellectual property policies are effective levers with which to stimulate university-industry
technology transfer and thus deserve further study. The importance of university factors in Study 3
implies that intellectual property policies must fit with their organizational contexts in order to be
productive.
This research also has important policy implications. Many governments have been attempting to
emulate the American Bayh-Dole Act by introducing or changing national regulations affecting
university IP policies. This research suggests that these national regulations may actually depress
researcher support for technology transfer and thus the amount of activity at those institutions that
would benefit from an alternate policy. In effect, standardization of university IP policies through
national regulations may deprive university administrators of an effective lever for encouraging
technology transfer on their campuses. This inference will be the focus of further research which will
broaden the work documented in this dissertation by exploring the relationship between university IP
policies, university-industry technology transfer, and university factors, including culture, across a
wider range of universities.

Introduction
The commercialization of university research has become a hot topic over the last ten years.
Commercialization is the process by which inventions, or new technologies, become innovations, or
market-ready products and services. As a result, commercialization activities offer the potential to
improve the quality of life by facilitating industry access by industry to new knowledge created in the
university, leading to the availability of improved products and services. There is also evidence that
the commercialization of university research can contribute to regional and national economic
growth, and international competitive advantage. These economic outcomes are highly desirable for
policy makers, in part because they represent a relatively direct benefit arising from public
investments in university research, which can be used in justifying these expenditures.
The potential to create sustainable economic advantage is particularly important in Canada where
the universities are the second largest performers of research and development (Thompson, 2005, p.
24). Canadian universities perform one third of all research and development in Canada; for every
dollar spent on research performed by industry in Canada, $0.65 is spent on doing research in
Canadian universities (Thompson, 2005). Furthermore, the importance of university research is
probably going to grow as Canada tries to close the “innovation gap” between itself and other major
industrialized nations (Gu & Whewell, 1999). In 2003, Canadian business expenditures on R&D
represented only 1.0% of GDP, much less than the U.S.’s 1.8% or the OECD average of 1.5% (Expert
Panel on Commercialization, 2006). Furthermore, the World Economic Forum ranked Canadian
businesses 27th in the world in terms of their propensity to compete based on unique products and
processes (World Economic Forum, 2005 as cited in Expert Panel on Commercialization, 2006). This
“innovation gap” is a continuing challenge made more difficult by the relative scarcity of policy
levers beyond the provision of tax credits for scientific research and development (for an overview of
tax credits in this context, see Audretsch et al., 2002). In these circumstances, governments are quite
likely to continue to encourage higher levels of university technology transfer activity, as a
component of an overall policy program to increase the amount of R&D integrated into Canadian
products and services and in the hopes of realizing more economic benefits from public investments
in university research.
Internationally, the most notable policy move in support of technology transfer is the Bayh-Dole
Act, enacted in the United States in 1980. It streamlined university-industry technology transfer of
technologies arising from research that had been funded by the U.S. federal granting councils and
agencies. Prior to Bayh-Dole, each agency maintained its own policies and processes regarding
commercialization activities and a complex set of bilateral agreements between individual universities
and government agencies governed university technology transfer. The Bayh-Dole Act transferred
ownership of all intellectual property arising from publicly-funded research to the universities and
required, in exchange, that the universities commercialize any promising technologies. Therefore, the
act increased the incentives for university involvement in technology transfer and made it easier for
universities to manage the commercialization of publicly-funded research. The act’s requirements
1

<-----Page 15----->2
also created increased capacity for technology transfer across the U.S. because many universities
opened technology transfer offices (TTOs) or their equivalent; the number of TTOs grew from 25 in
1980 to over 200 by 1995 (Mowery & Sampat, 2001a).
There are two common misunderstandings of the Bayh-Dole Act. First, since the act supersedes
university policies, it is sometimes described as creating a uniform policy for all universities.
However, the act only pertains to publicly-funded inventions so university policies still apply to all
other inventions. For example, at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, inventors still own any
intellectual property arising from non-publicly funded research (University of Wisconsin-Stout,
2000). Secondly, the act is often simply described as a switch to university ownership of intellectual
property. This description fails to acknowledge that, prior to the Bayh-Dole Act, many government
agencies permitted universities to commercialize inventions; these permissions were provided
through bilateral agreements between universities and government agencies. This description can also
be misinterpreted as a shift away from the “inventor-ownership” policies common in many other
countries. In fact, “university-ownership” was the dominant model for university intellectual property
policies in the United States prior to the Bayh-Dole Act (Bowers & Leon, 1994).
The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 is often credited with a very significant role in encouraging
universities to embrace technology transfer activities and thus with the creation of significant
economic benefits. For example, The Economist has declared, “More than anything, this single policy
measure helped to reverse America's precipitous slide into industrial irrelevance” ("Innovation's
golden goose", 2002, p. 3). Several studies that investigated the impact of the Bayh-Dole Act
provided evidence of this relationship, noting an increase in the propensity of universities to file
patents starting in 1981 (e.g. Jensen & Thursby, 2001; Shane, 2004b). However, other studies argue
strongly that this is a misattribution, pointing to other changes to the U.S. university milieu during the
1970s and 1980s, including the role of the Research Corporation in developing organizational
capabilities to support technology transfer at the universities (Mowery & Sampat, 2001a), and the
increasing propensity of private universities in the U.S. to become involved in patenting and licensing
over the 1970s (Mowery & Sampat, 2001b). Rai and Henderson (2003) note that developments in the
field of biotechnology have narrowed the gap between fundamental research and commercial
applications and that these changes, together with the broadening of patent rights by the U.S. legal
system, appear to have stimulated patenting activity in biotechnology1. These arguments are further
strengthened by the trends in the number of patents per dollar of research expenditures at the
universities; the time series of this measure displays an upward trend that is stable starting in the early
1970s (Mowery et al., 2004). As a result, Mowery and Sampat (2005) caution policy-makers that the
impact of the policy decisions embodied by the Bayh-Dole Act need to be considered within the
context of the U.S. national innovation system and that adoption of similar policies may not have
similar results in another context.
1

Kortum and Lerner (1999) demonstrated that the changes noted by Rai and Henderson (2003) do not account
for the rise in domestic patenting in the U.S. Instead, they suggest that the trend is a result of changes to the
management of research and the aggressive exploitation of the patent system by new and less established
patentees but they do not explain the behaviour of the new entrants (1999). Rai and Henderson’s arguments are
provided here as rationales for the more aggressive pursuit of patents by these new entrants including
universities.

<-----Page 16----->3
In spite of these critiques, the Bayh-Dole Act is often cited as part of the rationale when nations
move to “university-ownership” policies. Denmark, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Spain and Korea are
examples of countries that cited the U.S. act in their recent decisions to adopt “university-ownership”
policies, replacing policies that allowed ownership of university-developed technologies to vest with
the inventors (Association of University Technology Managers, 2006a; Mowery & Sampat, 2005).
Japan has introduced even broader changes in moving towards the current U.S. model of universityindustry technology transfer. Through the Industrial Revitalization Act, Japan has privatized its
national universities so that they can have the legal status required to apply for patents and the
universities have been granted the ownership of all inventions developed with university resources
through the November 2002 report of the Ministry of Education’s IPR working group. Prior to the
Industrial Revitalization Act, ownership rested with individual researchers but the researchers had to
navigate complex government procedures to gain permissions for commercialization activities
(Collins & Wakoh, 2000; Watts, 2000).
Canada is not immune to this international trend. The most significant policy document published
on this topic in the past decade also cites the Bayh-Dole Act as a reason for policy change. The Prime
Minister’s Expert Panel on the Commercialization of University Research recommended that
universities should retain title to inventions resulting from publicly funded research. This
recommendation was supported by the assertion that “the proposed IP policy framework will inspire
a transformational shift in culture within Canadian universities, as happened in the U.S. with the
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980” (1999, p. 28).

1.1 Research Statement
Clearly, there is enormous political interest in promoting university-industry technology transfer.
Ideally, the relevant policy-makers would have access to copious research into university-industry
technology transfer. Unfortunately, little appears to be known about several of the key relationships in
this area. For example, many of the proposed federal policy changes would influence or override
university intellectual property policies. These university policies are the target of the proposed
changes because they are widely expected to be a significant lever in changing the university
researcher’s involvement with technology transfer activities and because they are one of the few
aspects of the university environment which can be easily changed by administrators. However, little
research has been done in this area and the impact of these policies upon technology transfer, like
licensing and the formation of spin-off companies, is not clear; in particular, it is not known whether
or not university ownership of the intellectual property rights to inventions arising from university
research has an important effect on the commercialization of these inventions. In spite of increasing
amounts of activity in the past five to ten years, research on the topic of technology transfer is still
quite embryonic (Shane, 2004a), and very little empirical work has been done to assess the
importance of various factors in determining the amount of this technology transfer activity across
institutions or nations. The research reported in this thesis was designed to help answer these
important policy questions by conducting empirical research in response to the following research
question:

<-----Page 17----->4
What, if any, relationships exist between intellectual property policies and
university-industry technology transfer, through licensing and the
formation of spin-off companies, in Canada?
The research goals are to provide timely information and analysis to university and government
policy makers both in Canada and abroad, and to contribute to the emerging field of technology
transfer research.

1.2 The Canadian Context
Three aspects of the Canadian university system make it a good one in which to study the relationship
between university intellectual property (IP) policy and university-industry technology licensing.
First, the vast majority of the post-secondary institutions are public universities that share the same
mandate and are maintained by relatively consistent funding systems. Second, the public universities
appear to be embracing the challenge of commercializing university research. Third, they exhibit a
wide diversity of IP policies.
In Canada, almost all the universities are public institutions. These universities vary from small
liberal arts universities with less than three thousand students to large, multi-location institutions
offering a wide range of undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees to over fifty thousand
students. However, all Canadian universities share the same three mandates: education, research, and
community service. The public universities not only provide access to the majority of degree granting
programs (The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, 2005) but also perform
approximately one third of the nation’s research (Thompson, 2005). These institutions are governed
by and receive most of their operational funding through the provincial governments. The federal
government provides funds for operating costs indirectly by providing transfer payments to the
provinces and provides funds for research expenses directly, primarily through the three federal
research-granting councils. As a result, both university funding levels and the relative importance of
different sources of university funding vary less from institution to institution in Canada than in the
U.S. (Boychuk, 2000). This consistency reduces the risk that an analysis of the levels of technology
transfer activity across the universities will be contaminated by factors external to the universities.
There is evidence that Canada is also undergoing the ‘second revolution’ described by Etzkowitz
(1998) and increasingly supporting technology transfer activities. In 1980, very few Canadian
universities had offices dedicated to supporting intellectual property management and the
commercialization of university research (Expert Panel on the Commercialization of University
Research, 1999). By 2003, 78% of universities were actively managing IP, and 68% of them through
a central office dedicated to this activity (Read, 2005). From 1997 to 2003, respondents to the
Statistics Canada Surveys of Intellectual Property Commercialization in the Higher Education Sector
reported increases of 123% and 138% in the number of active licences held by the universities and
university spin-off companies, respectively (Bordt & Read, 1999; Read, 2005). This evidence
suggests that there is enough activity in Canada that it will be possible to look for relationships
between the level of activity and intellectual property policy variables.

<-----Page 18----->5
In spite of these similarities, Canadian universities exhibit a wide variety of IP policies. The
federal government does not regulate the rights and responsibilities of inventors and universities with
respect to technology transfer (Atkinson-Grosjean, 2002), so universities can hold policies that differ
widely. In 2003, technology managers at 61 of the 121 Canadian universities, which were included in
the Statistics Canada survey, reported that their university affords researchers either full or joint
ownership of any IP arising from their research (Read, 2005). This stands in stark comparison with a
number of other countries. For example, in the United States, all but three universities retain the rights
to IP developed by their faculty (Bowers & Leon, 1994). Therefore, a Canadian investigation of the
influence of IP policies on university-industry licensing is expected to be of international interest.

<-----Page 19----->Chapter 2
Background and Literature Review
This chapter is organized into two sections. The first section provides a brief description of
intellectual property (IP), IP policies, and technology transfer, in the context of the commercialization
of university research. This discussion of technology transfer includes a brief review of the regional
and national impact of technology transfer. The second section reviews the literature that investigates
the relationship between university IP policies and university-industry technology transfer.

2.1 Intellectual Property, Policies, and Technology Transfer
2.1.1 Intellectual Property
Intellectual property (IP) protection is key to technology transfer because it addresses the inherent
conflict between academe’s expectations of open publishing of academic work and their industrial
partners’ need to preserve competitive advantage, which in many industries is accomplished by
preserving trade secrets. IP protections are designed to stimulate innovation by granting the entities
responsible for the invention of a novel product, process or design or the discovery of a material or
new plant hybrid a time-limited monopoly to benefit from their work in exchange for the open
publication of a description of the work (Harvard University, 1999). This time-limited monopoly
represents a competitive advantage that can be legally transferred through licensing agreements or
sale of the IP. Therefore, IP protection can create a competitive advantage that is not dependent on
secrecy. With IP protection, researchers can publish their research and still provide industrial partners
with the incentive to commercialize their inventions (Conceição et al., 1998).
There are many different forms of IP protection. As shown in Table 1, the different forms of
technology-related intellectual property protection used by Canadian universities and research
hospitals include patents, copyright registration, new plant registration, and the registration of
industrial designs. All of these forms of IP protection provide a successful applicant with legal rights
to determine who can and can not use the invention for some predetermined length of time.
Patents appear to be the most commonly employed form of IP protection. It is clear from Table 1
that patenting is the dominant form of technology-related IP protection currently in use in Canada.
The number of disclosures protected by patents is more than 20 times the number of disclosures
protected by copyright. Most universities exclusively use patents to protect IP. A review of the
Statistics Canada surveys demonstrates that this has been true since 1998 (Bordt & Read, 1999; Read,
2000, 2003, 2005). The absence of any other form of IP protection in a major survey of American
TTOs suggests that this is also the case in the United States (Association of University Technology
Managers, 2004).
Since the objective of this research is to provide results of practical significance, where this
research must focus on only one form of IP protection, it will focus on patents, the dominant form of
6

<-----Page 20----->7
IP protection. The main limitation of this approach is an inability to account for software inventions,
which are often protected by copyrights instead of patents, and this bias may influence crosscomparisons of institutions.

2.1.2 Policies Governing the Commercialization of University Research
The policies governing university research define the rights and responsibilities of the members of the
university with respect to the protection and commercialization of IP arising from university research.
The definition of rights and responsibilities often includes clauses that define the permitted
technology transfer activities, the processes that support technology transfer, and the sharing of the
benefits of these activities.
The policies that govern the commercialization of university research are usually designed and held
by universities and national governments. Some countries have federal policies that govern the
commercialization of university research and these policies usually overrule any university IP
policies. For example, U.S. universities and colleges own and have an obligation to commercialize IP
arising from government-funded university research regardless of the university policy (Mowery et
al., 2004). Canada does not have a federal policy governing the commercialization of university
research, so the only policies governing technology transfer in Canada are the IP policies of the
universities (Atkinson-Grosjean, 2002).
In Canada, many universities have different policies for different members of the university. Most
have policies that pertain to faculty members (Read, 2005). Some have different policies, and some

<-----Page 21----->8
appear to have no policies at all, that apply to other members of the university, including staff and
students.
For the most part, the incentives offered to faculty members are not also offered to other staff
members at the university. Many university IP policies contain clauses that provide the university
with ownership of inventions developed as a component of “assigned tasks.” These clauses apply to
most of the work done by staff members and so the incentives offered to faculty are generally not
offered to staff.
Many of the Canadian policies that apply to faculty do not also apply to students. Among the 23
Canadian universities that reported receiving invention disclosures from students in the 2001
Statistics Canada survey, at least six universities had policies for faculty but no policies for students,
and at least another four had different policies for faculty and students (Read, 2003). Comments by
the respondents to the survey noted that some institutions have policies for graduate students but not
for undergraduate students (Read, 2003). For example, the University of Saskatchewan does not
appear to have a policy for undergraduates and the policy for graduate students, while similar to the
policy for faculty members, also includes additional restrictions on publication delays (University of
Saskatchewan, 1996).
Since the policies treat different members of the university differently, this analysis will focus on
university faculty members and their involvement in technology transfer. This is unlikely to bias the
results significantly because faculty members are expected to account for most technology transfer
activity. University staff members tend not to be involved in university research to the same extent as
faculty and students and are, therefore, unlikely to account for a significant number of inventions.
Interviews with technology managers at the University of Waterloo and M.I.T. suggest that even
though students are important producers of commercializable inventions and can have an important
role in economic development by taking new ideas with them into industry, they tend not to be
directly involved in technology transfer activities as defined in this thesis (Morrison, 1995). This is
consistent with the small percentage of universities that reported receiving invention disclosures from
students in 2001 (Read, 2003). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that faculty members account for
most technology transfer activity originating from publicly-funded research.
2.1.3 Technology Transfer
The phrase ‘technology transfer’ has been used to denote a very wide range of activities. Part of the
ambiguity associated with the phrase stems from the term ‘technology’. This word is often used to
denote products, processes and configurations of products or processes that are intimately related with
applied science (Betz, 1995; Bozeman, 2000). However, as Sahal observed, these products, processes
and configurations are not useful without knowledge of their applications (Sahal, 1981). Therefore,
for the remainder of the paper the term technology will be used to describe not only the device,
process or configuration but also the knowledge of the construct’s applications, and invention will be
used to refer to new technology.
The technology transfer literature describes the movement of applied scientific knowledge between
institutions of various sorts. Common themes include firm to firm interactions, international
technology transfer, particularly between the first and third world, and the commercialization of

<-----Page 22----->9
university research (Bozeman, 2000). In this thesis, technology transfer refers exclusively to the
commercialization of university research through the licensing of IP and through spin-off company
formation.
These mechanisms for technology transfer are not the only important mechanisms. Analysis of the
data collected by the Carnegie-Mellon Survey on Industrial R&D indicated that the key channels
through which information is transferred from university research to industry include academic
papers, conferences and meetings, informal exchanges, and consulting (Cohen et al., 2002). Agrawal
and Henderson’s investigation of knowledge flows indicated that MIT’s industry partners view
faculty consulting, academic publications, collaborative research, the recruitment of graduate students
and the co-supervision of graduate students as more important knowledge transfer channels than
patenting and licensing (2002). Furthermore, several of these mechanisms, including academic
publication, openly disseminate new knowledge and thus create public goods (Gu & Whewell, 1999).
Licensing and spin-off formation were chosen as the focus of this research because, among of the
various knowledge channels, they are most directly affected by university IP policies. The other
forms of knowledge transfer have little connection to university IP policies. University IP policies
rarely have clauses governing faculty consulting activities. The university policy that most pertains to
faculty consulting activities in Canada is a requirement for faculty members to report consulting
activities; however, administrators at these universities noted that the policy was not enforceable
(Read, 2000). Therefore, there is unlikely to be a strong relationship between any university policies
and faculty consulting activities. Some universities have policies that pertain to contract research but
generally contract research is negotiated on a case-by-case basis (Read, 2000). The other channels,
like co-supervision of graduate students and academic publishing, have little if any connection with
IP policies. Therefore, this investigation of the effects of university IP policies will be limited to their
effect on licensing and spin-off formation.
Licensing and spin-off formation are also of special interest because, unlike many of the other
activities, they require additional investments. The resources provided to university TTOs are
primarily used to staff TTOs and to pay legal fees incurred in the patenting and licensing of university
technologies. The Statistics Canada survey of Canadian universities, research hospitals and research
institutions revealed that TTOs spent $36.4 million in 2003, of which 47% was spent on employee
salaries and benefits on the equivalent of 255 full-time employees, 29% was spent on patent and
regular legal expenses, 4% was spent on litigation, and 21% was spent on other operational expenses
(Read, 2005). Among these institutions, universities probably accounted for the majority of the
expenditures. In 2003, TTOs at 27 Canadian universities were staffed by the equivalent of 215 fulltime employees, 105 of whom were primarily employed in technology transfer activities, including
licensee solicitation, technology valuation, marketing of technology, licence agreement drafting and
negotiation, and spin-off efforts (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004). These
universities spent $8.0 million on legal fees (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004).
Since the universities appear to employ about 80% of the technology managers in Canada and
account for about 80% of the spending on legal fees, it is likely that the total cost of TTOs in
Canadian universities is approximately 80% of the total spending, or approximately $29.0 million, in
2003.

<-----Page 23----->10
The next two subsections will briefly describe the two identified technology transfer
mechanisms, licensing and spin-off formation, and the subsequent subsection will describe the impact
of these forms of technology transfer in Canada.
2.1.3.1 Licensing
Licences are contracts that allow the licensee to make use of the licensor’s IP by using or selling
some product or process. The contract can limit the right of use to certain fields of use or to use in a
particular territory. Licences can also include options to acquire further improvements on the existing
technology that arise from further university research, sublicensing rights, and assistance with the
development of the technology through contract research and faculty consulting (Jones, 2004). In
exchange, the university receives financial compensation. Common components of a licensing
agreement at the University of California at San Francisco include a signing fee, an annual
maintenance fee, royalties, and additional payments based on milestones, such as the acquisition of
FDA approval (Boswell & Sauer, 1998). Licensing executives estimated that the licensor should
usually receive financial compensation worth between one quarter and one third of the product sales
or savings generated by the use of the innovation (Boswell & Sauer, 1998). However, the value of the
innovation also depends on a variety of factors including whether or not the licence is exclusive, the
strength of the IP protection, the existence of competitive technology (Boswell & Sauer, 1998), and
the amount of risk involved in the commercialization, which is highly influenced by the stage of
development of the technology (Jones, 2004). As a result, the staff responsible for overseeing
technology transfers at universities, also called university technology managers, are told to expect
royalty rates as low as 0.5% for non-exclusive licences of bio-technology that provides a benefit only
in combination with other innovations, or as high as 40% for exclusive licences of market-ready
software (Jones, 2004).
Measures used to track licensing activities at universities include the number of new licences
created per year, the number of active licences, the number of licences resulting in revenues, and the
total licensing revenues per institution size (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004;
Read, 2005). Recent surveys also make additional distinctions between, for example, exclusive and
non-exclusive licences and whether or not the industry partner is a small or medium-sized enterprise
(Association of University Technology Managers, 2004; Read, 2005).
The significant challenge when using these measures in quantitative analyses is the skewness of
many variables, especially licensing revenues. Empirical research has demonstrated that private
returns from individual technological innovations are quite skewed (Scherer & Harhoff, 2000). The
same is true of the income universities derive from the licensing of intellectual property. Not all IP is
licensed and licences appear to have a positively skewed distribution with a majority of licences
resulting in little or no financial return to the university and a minority of licences yielding
significant, and sometimes spectacular, income for the university (Gregory & Sheahen, 1991). As
noted earlier, Canadian universities also demonstrate positively-skewed income from licensing
intellectual property. The positive skewness of the income distribution means that great care needs to
be taken when using this measure in cross-comparisons of universities.

<-----Page 24----->11
Another concern with the use of these measures is the bias towards “university-owner”
institutions. Both the AUTM and the Statistics Canada data are provided by university TTOs. As a
result, the data do not capture the licensing activities of university researchers when the licences do
not involve the university TTO. Some university technology managers have complained about
technology escaping “out the back door,” which is evidence that this occasionally occurs at even
“university-owner” institutions (Blumenstyk, 2002). Therefore, it is plausible that these measures fail
to include a substantial amount of activity at “inventor-owner” universities.
2.1.3.2 Spin-off companies
Spin-off companies are defined in a number of different ways in the literature and by the
organizations that track university-industry interactions. In the literature, there is often a focus on new
technology-based firms but some definitions include all ventures started by members of a university,
either immediately or within a certain time period after leaving the university (Stankiewicz, 1994).
The Association of University Technology Managers defines spin-offs as those firms formed to
license technology from a university (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004).
Statistics Canada recognizes as spin-off companies those companies formed with the help of
university TTOs for one or more of the following reasons: to license the institution’s technology, to
fund research at the institution in order to develop technology that will be licensed by the company or
to provide a service that was originally offered through the institution’s department or unit (example
providing laboratory services of some kind) (Read, 2000). The Industrial Research Assistance
Program (IRAP), a branch of the National Research Council of Canada, recognizes as spin-off
companies those technology companies that are started by university faculty with or without the
assistance of a TTO (Read, 2000). In order to remain consistent with the focus on the relationship
between intellectual property policies and the transfer of technology from the university, this research
will focus on only those firms formed in order to develop and commercialize new technology
developed at a university. Some of these spin-off companies will license technology from the
university; therefore, the two transfer mechanisms of interest are not mutually exclusive.
Measures used to track spin-off companies include counts of new spin-offs, counts of active spinoffs, the amount of equity in spin-offs held by universities, and university revenues from cashed-in
equity (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004; Read, 2005). The principal problem
with many of the measures tracked by the Association of University Technology Managers or
Statistics Canada is that the data do not include spin-offs formed without the assistance of a TTO.
IRAP, which does track these companies, listed 741 Canadian spin-off companies formed by 1999
and Statistics Canada reported only 471 (Read, 2000). The 57% difference in spin-off counts strongly
suggests that the AUTM and Statistics Canada numbers may be significant underestimates of the
formation of university spin-off companies at “inventor-owner” universities.
2.1.4 Impact of Technology Transfer
This section reviews the literature pertaining to the impact of university technology transfer, in terms
of the following four desirable outcomes: 1) improved quality of life through the incorporation of new
technology into goods, services, and industrial practices; 2) national economic development, 3)

<-----Page 25----->12
regional economic development, and 4) the provision of an additional stream of revenues in
support of universities and university research.
2.1.4.1 Improved Quality of Life
No estimate of the impact of university-industry technology transfer on quality of life was found.
However, it is possible to demonstrate the impact on the quality of life by reviewing examples of
university technologies that have been made available to society through technology transfer. Many
readers will be familiar with high-profile university spin-off companies, including MDS Sciex, QLT,
Open Text, Dalsa, and Angiotech Pharmaceuticals. However, the impact on quality of life is even
broader than that implied by these high-profile cases in biotechnology and information technology.
The following table includes Canadian examples pertaining to medicine, agriculture, information
technology, manufacturing, and the environment that demonstrate that there are also a set of lowerprofile companies that also have an impact on many aspects of quality of life. This suggests that
technology transfer has a broad impact on quality of life and more depth than just that implied by
high-profile spin-off companies.

Q1 Labs Inc., a privately funded
Delaware corporation with
offices in California and New
Brunswick, was founded to
commercialize a computer
program, developed at the
University of New Brunswick
(Association of University

The program can visually
represent a computer network
of any size, which facilitates
the monitoring of networks
and the management of
potential internal and external

(Association of University

Q1 Labs’ customers include
the U.S. government, state
and municipal government
agencies, universities,
financial institutions, energy
firms, service providers, and
healthcare providers (Q1
Labs, 2005). For example,
Harvard University has
described Q1 as their main
network anomaly control
system (Brown, 2006).

CVD Diamond Corp., of
London, Ontario, was founded to
exploit a new method for
manufacturing diamond-coated
industrial tools developed at the
University of Western Ontario
(Association of University
Technology Managers, 2006c).

The new manufacturing
process produces tools that last
at least 20% longer than other
state-of-the-art diamondcoated tools and 10 to 20 times
longer than tungsten carbide
tools (Association of
University Technology
Managers, 2006c).

By early 2006, CVD had 50
corporate clients, and sales
had been growing steadily by
approximately 25% for
several years (Brennan,
2006).

New groundwater remediation
technologies, collectively known
as permeable reactive barriers, or
PRBs, have been developed at
the University of Waterloo and
have been patented and licensed
to industry (Association of
University Technology
Managers, 2006b).

When installed in the path of
the contaminated groundwater,
PRBs remove contaminants as
groundwater flows through
them (Association of
University Technology
Managers, 2006b). Not only
are the filters very effective,
they also cost less than the
competing technologies, which
require pumping the
groundwater to the surface for
treatment (Association of
University Technology
Managers, 2006b).

The PRB designed to filter
out heavy metal
contaminants has been fieldtested at five sites in Canada
and the United States
(Association of University
Technology Managers,
2006b). Thus far, twelve
commercial entities have
licensed the technology,
including several in Canada,
five in the United States and
several in the European
Union (Association of
University Technology
Managers, 2006b).

<-----Page 27----->14
The examples provided in the preceding table include four instances in which a technology was
further developed and made available by spin-off companies and one instance in which the
technology was licensed to a number of industrial partners. It is unlikely that these technologies
would have been made available without the resources for technology development acquired through
the technology transfer process. Based on the general trend with university technologies, it is likely
that each of these technologies was quite embryonic when the inventors first sought to commercialize
them (2001). In the creation of each spin-off company, resources were acquired and organized around
the further development of the technology. Relevant resources include human resources, in the form
of individuals with the requisite business knowledge and skills, and the financial resources required to
further develop the product, engage in product trials, acquire the requisite regulatory approvals, and
so on. Even in the case of the PRB, a technology with sufficient interest for the associated industry
that it was licensed to multiple receptor organizations, the role of technology transfer was important.
Industrial partners were only interested in adopting the technology after data were collected from
expensive field trials (Inwood, 2006), in part because of the need to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the technology to regulatory bodies (Association of University Technology Managers, 2006b). These
examples provide evidence that technology transfer activities facilitate the provision of improved
goods and services and, as a result, improve the quality of life in Canada and elsewhere.
The only indicators of the magnitude of this effect that could be located are simple patent and
technology counts. By 2003, Canadian universities held at least 1,756 active licences representing the
transfer of at least 722 inventions (Read, 2005).
2.1.4.2 National Economic Development
The organization of resources around the development and provision of improved goods and services
has also been linked to economic benefits including national economic growth. Estimates of the
economic impact of university technology transfer usually assess the impact of licensing and spin-offs
separately.
In 1995, the AUTM economic impact committee investigated the economic impact of the licensing
of university technology in Canada and the U.S. Using the AUTM survey data on licensing revenues,
they estimated that university technologies accounted for U.S.$20.6 billion in product sales in 1996
(Gu & Whewell, 1999). Following Pressman et al.’s argument that the economic impact should also
include pre-production investment2 (1995), the committee also found that university technologies
accounted for a further U.S.$4.2 billion in 1996, which translated into a total economic impact of
$24.8 billion per year, supporting an estimated 212,500 jobs (Gu & Whewell, 1999). Gu and Whewell
estimated the economic impact of Canadian university technologies by allocating the above estimates
in proportion to the ratio of gross licence income in Canada and the U.S. (Gu & Whewell, 1999).
They estimated that the total economic impact of the Canadian university-industry licensing was
U.S.$500 million per year, supporting approximately 4,000 jobs (Gu & Whewell, 1999). These
estimates rely on assumption that the ratios of GDP and job creation to gross licence income are the

2

Pre-production is the phase of commercialization in which the manufacturing processes and techniques
required to produce the product are developed.

<-----Page 28----->15
same in Canada and the U.S. More recent estimates of the economic impact of university licensing
were not located. However, the application of the above estimation technique would result in an
increased assessment of the economic impact because gross licensing revenues increased from
Cdn$16.1 million to Cdn$36.5 million, an increase of 127%, between 1996 and 2003 (Association of
University Technology Managers, 1997, 2004). If the previous ratios continued to hold, the total
economic impact of Canadian university licensing in 2003 would have been U.S.$1.1 billion per year,
supporting 9,100 jobs.
The economic impact of spin-offs has also been assessed using product sales and employment
information. An NSERC investigation of the 107 spin-offs formed to commercialize university
research that had been funded by NSERC, found that these companies accounted for about Cdn$1
billion of product sales, and employed more than 5,000 Canadians (Gu & Whewell, 1999). Vincett
(2005) calculated the return on investment of government research spending by estimating the present
value of past and projected spin-off revenues. The spin-offs that have developed from Canadian
university research in physics had an impact-to-total-funding ratio of 1.26, which combined with
multipliers related to the recirculation of money in the economy suggested that “the total economic
impact is nearly four time the original outlay” (2005).
The main drawback to these estimation techniques of the economic value of university licensing
and spin-off formation is that they allocate all of the economic benefits arising from the development
of university technologies to the technology that leaves the university, often in a very early stage of
development (2001). This allocation probably underestimates the importance of other resources
required to develop the invention, which can include inventions from other sources, and thus
overstates the economic value of the university activities. Furthermore, these assessments only look at
the outcomes of university-industry technology transfer. An opportunity-cost analysis of their benefits
would need to “take into account foregone opportunities, especially alternative uses for scientific and
technical resources” (Bozeman, 2000). No such analyses could be located, probably because of the
difficulty in estimating the “counter-factual,” a hypothetical situation in which scientific and technical
resources are otherwise employed (Bozeman, 2000). Again, this criticism suggests that existing
estimates of economic impact overstate the value of university-industry technology transfer.
While it is clear that more work needs to be done in providing reliable estimates of the impact of
university-industry technology transfer, the current best estimates suggest that these activities have a
substantial positive effect on the economy.
2.1.4.3 Regional Economic Development
There is also an emerging literature on the multi-faceted benefits that universities bring to their
surrounding regions. This literature includes estimates of the total economic benefits realized by a
regions containing universities, where the economic impact can include the effects of knowledge
spillovers to local firms or the regional impact of the creation of university spin-off companies (e.g.
Martin, 1998, 2004; Pricewaterhouse Cooper, 2001).
The possibility that university research can stimulate economic growth in their surrounding regions
is of great interest for governments because it implies that the economic benefits of investments in
university research can be captured within the country. The impressive success of a few high-profile,

<-----Page 29----->16
high-technology clusters suggest that the economic benefits can be substantial. For example, the
development of Silicon Valley is credited in part to Stanford University. Miner et al. (Miner et al.,
2001) and Armstrong (2001)are very skeptical of the extent to which the economic growth
demonstrated by these “totemic” sites of the new economy are realizable in other contexts (2001, p.
525). To a large extent, this question can only be addressed by further research.
To date, the emerging literature has demonstrated some links between universities and regional
development that extend beyond Armstrong’s totemic sites. In a survey of 1000 American academics,
most faculty members reported that their universities were actively engaged in regional economic
development (Lee, 1996). An investigation of university-industry interactions in the bio-technology
sector in the U.S. and Europe, found that these interactions were rooted in regional clusters (OwenSmith et al., 2002). Agrawal and Cockburn (2003) found strong evidence of the co-location of
upstream academic research and downstream industrial R&D suggesting the presence of knowledge
spill-overs. Siegel, Westhead, and Wright (2003) discovered higher research productivity among
firms located in university research parks in the U.K. In France, Monjon and Waelbroeck (2003)
found evidence that knowledge spillovers from universities increased the innovativeness of firms in
the university’s region that were less intensively engaged in R&D.
Overall, recent studies suggest that there is a role for universities in regional economic
development but that that role, in most cases, is likely to be less extravagant than the role depicted by
Stanford and the Silicon Valley.
2.1.4.4 Revenues for University Research
As universities have grown in number and in size they have become increasingly reliant on external
funding from governments and industry. Especially in periods of declining governmental or industry
funding, university administrators are expected to be interested in the potential to generate additional
resources through technology transfer. For example, Raine and Beukman (2002) attribute growing
interest in university-industry interactions in New Zealand to declining public funding of tertiary
education.
Even though a focus on technology transfer is relatively new to Canadian universities, technology
transfer appears to be generating a small stream of funds for the Canadian university system. In the
AUTM survey for 2003 (2004), Canadian universities reported total revenues of $36.5 million
resulting from technology transfer activities and $7.4 million of sponsored research tied to licences
and spin-offs. Based on the earlier estimate that the universities incurred costs of approximately $29
million in pursuit of technology transfer activities, this implies that altogether Canadian universities
realized $14.9 million in research and operational funding from their technology transfer activities in
2003.
The principal problem with estimating returns for individual universities based on national totals is
that technology transfer income appears to have a positively-skewed distribution. In the U.S., most
licences result in little or no financial return to the university and only a small minority of licences
provide significant, and sometimes spectacular, returns (Gregory & Sheahen, 1991; Parker &
Zilberman, 1993). The skewness of these returns prompted Feller (1990) to declare that for many

<-----Page 30----->17
universities, investing in technology transfer with the expectation of generating appreciable net
revenues is equivalent to buying a lottery ticket.
Returns from technology transfer activities also appear to follow a skewed distribution in Canada.
The Canadian university that receives the most licence income, about $10M per annum, receives the
vast majority of its licence revenue from a single technology that is widely licensed (Clayman, 2004).
Furthermore, this university receives about ten times more annual revenue than the next highestearning university (Clayman, 2004). Given the small size of the revenue stream and the skewness of
the distribution of the returns, it would probably be more realistic for universities to aim for modest
returns in order to reduce the costs of their investments in technology transfer rather than to expect
spectacular returns.
2.1.5 Summary
This section introduces and specifies the variables under study: 1) university intellectual property
policies governing faculty members, especially as they pertain to patents; and 2) university
technology transfer, where it is defined as the patenting and licensing of university technologies and
the creation of university spin-off companies. The final subsection establishes that university
technology transfer has the potential to contribute to quality of life, regional and national economic
development, and to do so at low cost to the universities. The literature cautions that spectacular
occurrences, such as cases in which universities realize significant returns from a technology transfer
or contribute to economic growth on the scale of Silicon Valley, are infrequent. However, there
remains a great deal of scope to entertain more cautiously optimistic expectations for the realization
of economic and social returns from university research. This possibility is sufficiently important to
warrant further research.

2.2 University IP Policies and Technology Transfer
This section builds on the introduction of the variables of interest by investigating the technology
transfer literature pertaining to the relationship between IP policies and university-industry
technology transfer. First, an overview of the technology transfer literature is provided as context.
The next subsection discusses empirical studies of the relationship between IP policies and
technology transfer. The last subsection summarizes the state of the literature.
2.2.1 Overview of the Literature
Agrawal (2001) describes the university-industry technology transfer literature as having four distinct
research areas, which study: 1) firm characteristics; 2) channels of knowledge transfer; 3) geography,
in terms of localized spillovers; and, 4) university characteristics. The literature concerned with firm
characteristics explores the characteristics of firms and partnerships that allow firms to make use of
scientific knowledge that is generated outside the firm (e.g. van den Berghe, 2001). The literature
concerned with channels of knowledge investigates the characteristics of different knowledge transfer
mechanisms, including publications, licensing, spin-off company formation, research contracts, joint
ventures, consulting, informal meetings, recruiting, and personal exchanges (e.g. Hoye et al., 2006).

<-----Page 31----->18
The localized spillover research stream explores the relationship between the ‘stickiness’ of tacit
knowledge and the geographical proximity between the creator and the recipient of the tacit
knowledge and thus focuses on relationships between universities and clusters of innovative activity
(e.g. Xu, 2003). The fourth research stream, ‘university characteristics,’ focuses on university issues,
including incentive structures for professors and university policies. Since this research is
investigating the relationship between policies that determine incentive structures and university
outcomes, it falls squarely within this last category. Therefore, the following literature review will
focus predominately on the empirical work that has been published in this research stream. The
review will examine studies that describe the role of faculty inventors in technology transfer and the
empirical evidence of a relationship between university IP policies and university-industry technology
transfer.
2.2.2 The Role of Faculty Inventors
This section reviews the role of faculty inventors in technology transfer activities because since this
role is key to understanding the importance of incentives for faculty support of technology transfer.
IP policies are assumed to influence technology transfer outcomes through their effect on faculty
inventor behaviour. Therefore, the strength and nature of the relationship between IP policies and
technology transfer outcomes will depend on the strength and nature of the relationship between
faculty behaviour and technology transfer outcomes. This section reviews the evidence that faculty
inventors are important actors in technology transfer: that their involvement may be critical for
success in some cases and a barrier to success in others.
2.2.2.1 Evidence that faculty inventor involvement is critical to success
Studies conducted in the U.S. where universities own IP, suggest that faculty inventors have a critical
role in the identification of commercializable technologies and disclosure of these technologies to
TTOs and in other supporting roles.
Most industry liaison offices rely on researchers to identify commercializable inventions and, in
many cases, technology transfers will not proceed if the researchers do not want to pursue the
commercialization of their inventions (Jensen et al., 2003; Read, 2000; Siegel, Waldman et al., 2003;
Stevens & Bagby, 1999). Thursby and Kemp (2002) discovered, in interviews with technology
managers, that the technology managers believe that less than 50% of all commercializable
technologies are disclosed to their offices. Thursby, Jensen and Thursby’s survey of university
technology managers revealed that directors of TTOs believe that some highly-productive faculty
members are unwilling to disclose inventions and that this is a significant barrier to the
commercialization of technology at their universities (2001).
There is also evidence that faculty inventors have an important role in the identification of possible
licensees for university technology. Jansen and Dillon (1999) found that faculty inventors were the
most likely to identify the licensor of a university technology; they identified the licensor in 56% of
cases, whereas TTO staff, licensing companies, research sponsors were responsible for 19%, 10%,
7% of the cases, respectively. Ramakrishnan, Chen and Balakrishnan (2005) analyzed the origins of
283 licences completed by the U.S. National Institutes for Health (NIH) and found that inventor

<-----Page 32----->19
contacts were responsible for 38% of the leads that led to licensing. Thursby, Jensen and
Thursby’s survey of university technology managers found evidence that the personal contacts of
faculty inventors are the primary source of marketing leads in the licensing of university inventions
(2001). This finding was further supported by Thursby and Thursby’s complementary survey of
industry receptors of technology transfer (2001). Siegel et al. (2003) noted the importance of faculty
“buy-in” to university-industry technology transfer, after 55 interviews with 98 entrepreneurs,
scientists, and administrators at five research-intensive universities in the U.S.. They observed that
faculty are important not only in terms of the disclosure of potentially commercializable technologies,
but also the marketing of the technology because “they are usually in a good position to identify
potential licensees and because their technical expertise often makes them a natural partner for firms
that wish to commercialize the technology” (Siegel, Waldman et al., 2003, p.29). This latter finding
suggests that faculty inventors also have a role in supporting the further development of
commercialization technologies.
Three studies have provided evidence that inventors have a significant role in the subsequent
development of university technologies. In Thursby, Jensen and Thursby’s survey of technology
managers, TTO staff indicated that the commercialization of 71% of licensed inventions required
inventor cooperation (2001). Agrawal (2006) demonstrated, using a dataset of 124 licence agreements
associated with inventions from MIT, that licensing strategies that directly engaged the inventor in
the commercialization process increased the likelihood and degree of commercialization success.
Hoye, Pries, Guild and Roe’s survey of Canadian and American technology managers indicated that
faculty inventor involvement in a wide range of technology transfer activities generally has a positive
effect on the probability of achieving a successful transfer of the technology, for those technologies
developed through the TTO (2006). The technology transfer activities assessed in the survey included
invention disclosure, evaluation of the invention, marketing, prototype development and licensing or
spin-off formation (2006).
The need for faculty inventors’ continued involvement beyond disclosure may be a function of the
need for tacit knowledge transfer, the stage of development of the technology and the
‘appropriability’ of the technology, where appropriability refers to the extent to which an innovating
firm can capture economic benefits through the commercialization of the technology (von Hippel,
1982). Bozeman (2000) and Agrawal (2006) have both argued that the successful transfer of
technology often depends on the concomitant transfer of tacit knowledge regarding the development
and use of the technology. Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to codify and thus it is most
effectively transferred using rich communication channels such as face-to-face communication.
Colyvas et al. (2002) explored the importance of tacit knowledge transfer through their review of
eleven case studies of inventions at Stanford and Columbia University. They suggest that the need for
tacit knowledge transfer and hence faculty inventor support for technology transfer is linked to the
stage of development of the technology; embryonic and early stage technologies require direct
interaction between academic inventors and company scientists (Colyvas et al., 2002). This is an
important finding because many university technologies are at very early stage of development.
Thursby, Jensen and Thursby’s (2001) survey found that the majority of inventions were at the proof
of concept or prototype stage with further development needed; only 12.3% were ready for
commercial use (2001). Shane (2002) used royalty, sponsorship and invention data from M.I.T. to

<-----Page 33----->20
investigate the commercialization of 1397 patents. He found evidence that highly-appropriable
technologies were most effectively commercialized via licensing to non-inventors in either new or
established firms; the inventions that were difficult to patent were most likely to be commercialized
when the university licensed the technology to the inventor, in effect permitting them to develop it
independently (2002).
Overall, these studies suggest that researcher support can be very important for technology transfer,
that this support can require a role in many technology transfer activities. However, the usefulness of
their involvement may depend on aspects of the technology or the transfer situation, including the
need for tacit knowledge transfer, the stage of development of the technology and the appropriability
of the technology.
2.2.2.2 Evidence that faculty inventor involvement is a barrier to success
In response to the survey by Hoye et al. (2006), a number of technology managers elaborated on their
responses to the survey’s Likert-type items with observations about the role of faculty inventors.
Some of these comments suggested that it was possible for faculty inventors to be over-involved in
technology transfer, especially the licensing of university technologies. The following comments are
illustrative of the range of responses.
Faculty inventors initiate our TT process and their level of
involvement can functionally expedite or cripple progress. But overinvolvement or under-involvement can lead to either of these
extreme outcomes.
I'm not sure if this [item] meant to ask whether faculty/inventors
solely negotiate licences OR assist in helping TTO/VC/business
mgrs negotiate licences? If solely, then disaster. If assist, then
positive (I assumed this).
Their participation beyond their input in identifying and initial
interaction with a potential licensee is not a strong determinant of
success in [technology transfer] via licensing.
Faculty must be excited about the technology transfer process but be
very clear that their role is to support the technology transfer process.
Inventors who respond to patent attorneys are generally responsive in
other areas as well, and there this is a reasonable predictor of
successful commercialization. Be responsive, stay involved. Leave
business issues to business people. Great if inventors identify
potential licencees & solicit government funding.
These comments suggest that high levels of involvement may be detrimental to the success of
technology transfer activities. Those that offer a rationale or refer to specific activities seem to
suggest that inventors are a liability in negotiations and in other ‘business’ activities.

<-----Page 34----->21
These technology managers are not alone in questioning the extent to which faculty inventors
can pursue technology transfer activities efficiently and effectively. Researchers have also posited
that faculty inventors may not have the requisite skills, experience or motivation to manage business
activities (Bower, 2003; Meyer, 2003). Meyer (2003) reviewed four case histories of spin-offs led by
faculty inventors and observed that, in some cases, the founders of the spin-off firms are seeking
avenues with which to develop their research, rather than seeking to build a high-growth, hightechnology firm. This is consistent with Otto’s suggestion that researchers tend to focus on their
product and its underlying technology rather than customer benefits, market needs and opportunities
(1999). Bower observes:
It is a difficult challenge for academic founders with little prior
market knowledge and linkages, and no previous experience of
professional investors and their requirements, to select the
applications and business models which will support successful
venture creation (2003, p. 97).
In summary, faculty inventors’ involvement in technology transfer activities may be a liability if they
take on managerial roles in licensing or spin-offs without first developing an understanding of the
market and a support network. However, the earlier section demonstrated that faculty inventors often
have a significant role in a wide range technology transfer activities. Their involvement can permit
access to valuable resources, including their tacit knowledge of the technology, the research skills that
they could direct towards further development of the technology, and their contacts with possible
licensees.
Since faculty inventor support for technology transfer is an important factor in technology transfer
outcomes, there is considerable interest in providing effective incentives in support of this behaviour.
Unlike employees in industry, researchers can not be compelled to select or pursue projects that do
not interest them and researcher support of technology transfer can be quite variable (Etzkowitz,
1998). Therefore, the next section reviews the literature regarding the relationship between incentives
for faculty involvement in technology transfer and technology transfer outcomes.
2.2.3 University IP Policies and Technology Transfer
Recent work, mainly in the U.S., has identified the financial incentives for faculty involvement in
technology transfer that are established by university IP policies as an important determinant of
technology transfer outcomes. These studies used quantitative, qualitative and mixed methodologies.
The following subsections discuss this empirical work, grouped by the type of methodology
employed.
2.2.3.1 Quantitative Studies
Four quantitative studies have demonstrated a relationship between the faculty member’s share of
revenues arising from technology transfer and university technology transfer outcomes. These studies,
summarized in Table 3, used regression analysis, recursive systems modeling and stochastic frontier
analysis to assess the impact of the financial incentives in the context of models that included other

<-----Page 35----->22
organizational variables. This section reviews each of the four studies, in alphabetical order by
author’s last name, and then discusses their strengths and weaknesses as a group.
2.2.3.1.1 Study 1
DiGregorio and Shane (2003) demonstrate a negative relationship between the inventor’s shares of
licensing revenues at a university and the number of spin-off companies associated with that
university, using panel data representing five fiscal years of activity at a set of U.S. universities. To
compensate for the large numbers of zeroes in the count data of spin-off companies started per
university per year and to address the possibility of auto-correlation across years, they chose to use
negative binomial models in generalized estimating equations (2003). Thirteen models are presented;
a main model and twelve others with which they demonstrate that their initial results are robust to
changes, including the omission of the universities that had no spin-off activity, and the use of
different random-effects generators to account for unobserved differences between the universities
(2003). Across all 13 models, the intellectual eminence of the university, as determined by the
Gourman graduate school score, had a significant and positive effect, the inventor’s share of the
revenues had a significant and negative effect, and the university’s demonstrated willingness to take
equity shares in spin-offs rather than requiring royalties had a significant and positive effect (2003).
The authors suggest that lower royalty rates may be an incentive to undertake the additional work
required for venture creation over licensing to an established firm when their shares of licensing
revenues are low (2003). They also observe that universities that are willing to take equity in lieu of
royalties are less likely to create cash flow problems for their spin-offs and can be seen as providing a
more supportive environment (2003).

2.2.3.1.2 Study 2
Friedman and Silberman (2003), employed a technique introduced by Carlsson and Fridh (2002), in
which the impact of cross-correlations between explanatory variables are mitigated by modeling
technology transfer as a sequence of events. Systems equations were designed that model two stages
in the technology transfer process, one leading to invention disclosure and another going from
invention disclosure to final outcomes (2003). Invention disclosures at each university were assumed
to be dependent on faculty quality, the number science departments at the university that offered
Ph.D. programs, and the amount of research funding provided to the university by the federal
government and industry (2003). The technology transfer outputs were assumed to depend on the
estimates for invention disclosures generated by the first systems equation, the income provided to the
inventor, a number of environmental factors including the concentration of high-technology industry
in the university’s region, the age of the TTO and a dummy variable representing whether or not the
TTO provides the university community with a statistical report of its activities (2003). The first
systems equation successfully predicted the annual invention disclosures at the universities over fiscal
years 1997-1999 (R2=.80) (2003). All of the independent variables were found to be significant at the
.05 level, at least (2003). The second systems equation was used to model five different outcomes for
each university in Fiscal Year 1999: the number of licences generating income; the number of
licences with equity; the cumulative number of active licences; the number of spin-off companies;
and, the amount of licence income received (2003). All of the explanatory variables were significant
in at least one of the models, with the exception of the variables distinguishing between types of
universities (private, land-grant, medical school) (2003). The inventor’s share of licensing revenues
was only a significant factor in the model of licence income, and only when the estimate of invention

<-----Page 37----->24
disclosures was dropped from the model (2003). This finding suggests that inventor’s shares of
revenues are a predictor but that they may covary with some or all of the variables used as
determinants of the number of invention disclosures in this model. Friedman and Silberman suggest
that the inventor’s share of licensing revenues has the most impact on licensing revenues, as opposed
to the other measures that were used, because successful licensing requires the continued involvement
of the faculty inventor.
Friedman and Silberman’s findings are weakened by the skewness of the response variable
licensing income. The authors attributed the lack of explanatory power (R2=.23) of the model in
which the inventor’s share of revenues was found to be significant to the skewed distribution of the
response variable (2003). Skewed response variables can lead to violations of the assumption
underlying regression analysis that the residuals will have a normal distribution. The authors did not
provide evidence that the skewness of the response variable did not violate this assumption, which
makes it impossible for readers to assess the validity of the observed relationship (2003).
2.2.3.1.3 Study 3
Link and Siegel (2005) evade problems with the skewness of the response variables by modeling
licensing outcomes using stochastic frontier equations. This modeling technique represents
organizational productivity measures using two sets of variables. The first set, called production
function parameters, includes all significant inputs for the process which is used to estimate the
highest productivity possible for each organization. In the Link and Siegel (2005) model, the
maximum possible licensing activity at each university is hypothesized to be a function of the
invention disclosures, the number of TTO staff, and the amount of legal expenditures. The second set
of variables, called the determinants of relative inefficiency, is used to explain differences between
each organization’s actual productivity figures and the maximum productivity levels estimated using
the first set of variables. Link and Siegel (2005) use six variables to model the differences between
the actual licensing performance of each university and the estimate of the maximum possible
activity. The six variables were: 1) a dummy variable indicating whether or not the university had a
hospital; 2) the average annual industry R&D intensity in the university’s state; 3) the average annual
real output growth in the university’s state; 4) the age of the TTO; 5) a dummy variable set to one if
the university has a centralized TTO and set to zero if the TTO is decentralized; and, 6) the inventor’s
share of technology transfer revenues (2005). The stochastic frontier equations were used to model
the number of licensing agreements and the amount of licensing revenue produced by each university,
on average over fiscal years 1991-1998. In both cases, the production functions were found to be
stable regardless of whether or not the determinants of relative inefficiency were included and, in at
least one of the cases, all of the production function determinants were significant at the .05 level
(2005). Only three of the six determinants of relative inefficiency were found to be significant: 1)
average annual industry R&D intensity in the university’s state; 2) the age of the TTO; and, 3) the
inventor’s share of technology transfer revenues (2005). Among these predictors the financial
incentives for involvement in technology transfer had the largest effect on both the average number of
licensing agreements and the average annual income of the universities that were investigated; Link
and Siegel conclude, “university administrators should view faculty as economic agents. Changing
incentives will change behaviour” (2005, p. 179).

<-----Page 38----->25
Stochastic frontier analysis is capable of modeling skewed response variables. However, the
strength of the findings is strongly linked to the extent to which the production function captures all
of the critical inputs for productivity. Link and Siegel’s choice of production function variables was
motivated by earlier empirical studies which represent the current state of the art (2005). However,
given the nascent state of the literature, only further research will be able to vindicate their model and
thus their findings.
2.2.3.1.4 Study 4
Lockett and Wright (2005) extend the other studies by investigating the relationship between the
researchers’ share of technology transfer revenues and spin-off formation in the U.K. Their
respondent variables (the number of spin-offs per year per university and the number of equity
investments in university spin-offs by external inventors per year per university) both demonstrate
skewed distributions (2005). To accommodate these distributions, the authors tested their hypotheses
using both negative binomial and Poisson regression techniques (2005). The model included two
constructs, ‘Business Development Capability’ and ‘Incentives and Rewards,’ that were assessed
using the Likert-type items in the author’s own survey (2005). ‘Business Development Capability’
relates to the extent to which the university has a clear process for developing spin-off companies
(2005). ‘Incentives and Rewards’ relates to the incentives and rewards for involvement by university
staff3 in spin-off formation (2005). The full model included eight other explanatory variables: 1) total
research expenditures by the university; 2) expenditures by the university on external IP advice; 3)
TTO staffing counts; 4) the age of the TTO; 5) 6) whether or not the university has a medical school;
7) whether or not the university has a science park; and, 8) the R&D intensity of the region (2005).
The model was strongly significant when tested using negative binomial regression techniques and
when tested using Poisson regression techniques. Three of the ten variables were found to be
significant at the .10 level under both tests: 1) expenditures by the university on external IP advice; 2)
‘Business Development Capability’; and, 3) the researcher’s share of revenues arising from
technology transfer (2005). The researcher’s share of technology transfer revenues was not significant
at a .05 level; therefore, the models provide only weak evidence that revenue sharing is a factor
(2005). In discussing the link between revenue sharing and spin-off activity, the authors observe that
universities seeking to support technology transfer may be more likely to provide higher shares of
licensing revenues to their inventors and that this “may form part of the array of signals to the
academic that the university is seeking to encourage technology transfer” and thus lead to increased
spin-off activity (2005, p. 1048).
2.2.3.1.5 Discussion
Together, the four quantitative studies provide some evidence that the financial incentives determined
by IP policies have an effect on technology transfer outcomes. The studies model the university
researcher as an economic agent, who is directly influenced by the costs and financial benefits of

3

It is not clear from the context whether the authors are referring to TTO staff members and/or faculty
members.

<-----Page 39----->26
multiple courses of action. Although the formal economic models of individual decision-making
can include non-financial variables, these models limited themselves to financial aspects of the
decision-making. The way in which the ‘economic agent’ model of motivation was used in these
studies, implies that the authors assume that the agents are knowledgeable about their choices and
make rational choices to maximize their personal financial gain. No research could be located that
directly investigated the decision-making processes of university inventors and the only research
regarding faculty inventors awareness of IP and IP policies found that faculty members at Monash
University were generally uninformed (Monotti, 2000). This finding suggests that the economic
agent theory focused only on financial benefit, as implied by these studies, may not provide an
adequate description of faculty inventor’s motivations for engaging in technology transfer.
One of the ways to counterbalance the current shallowness of the theory in the field and the high
reliance on a single data set demonstrated by the quantitative research is to explore the mixed
methods and qualitative research pertaining to the relationship between university IP policies and
technology transfer.
2.2.3.2 Qualitative and Mixed Methods Studies
Qualitative and mixed methods research can be used to elicit information from actors and
stakeholders and, as a result, these methods are often used in emerging areas of research to suggest
which factors are most likely to be important and why. As a result, these methods can be important in
establishing theory in emerging areas.
This section discusses three studies: two employed a purely qualitative methodology and another
used a mix of interview content analysis and regression analysis. The studies, summarized in Table 4,
will be reviewed separately in chronological order and then discussed together.

2.2.3.2.1 Study 1
Stevens and Bagby (1999) were among the first researchers who sought to identify significant factors
related to technology transfer activities in U.S. universities. Their study made an effort to obtain
information representative of best practices by restricting the study to TTOs with a long history and a
high level of activity. As a result, the results of their qualitative study are primarily descriptive. For
example, they observe that licensing fees are usually distributed between the inventor, the inventor’s
department, college, or research department, central administrative units and/or the TTO (1999). In
their conclusions, they state that incentive systems are needed to reward inventors but no rationale is
provided and it isn’t known to what extent this statement reflects the content of the interviews they
conducted (1999).
The authors note in the article that they provided little information regarding the methodology to
conform to the truncated format required by the journal (1999). Unfortunately, this makes it very
difficult to interpret the study. For example, it isn’t clear how many participants were interviewed or
at how many universities. Nor did the authors explain how they reduced and synthesized that data for
publication. As result, their claim that incentive systems are important can only be treated as weak
evidence of an effect.

<-----Page 41----->28
2.2.3.2.2 Study 2
Siegel, Waldman, Atwater and Link (2004) conducted 55 structured interviews with 98 stakeholders,
including TTO directors, university administrators who oversaw TTOs, academic scientists and
managers or entrepreneurs based at firms in university science parks (2004). The participants were
all members of a convenience sample of research-intensive universities in North Carolina and
Arizona, the states in which the authors reside (2004). The authors argue that the sample is more
likely to be representative of a wide range of U.S. universities than a study that restricts its focus to
higher-profile institutes, which are recognized as leaders with respect to technology transfer (2004).
The interviews were structured using a list of open-ended prompts derived from the literature that
were largely common across stakeholder groups (2004). The data analysis was conducted following
Miles and Huberman’s three stage approach and all of the comments were independently categorized
by at least two of the researchers to minimize the impact of individual bias (2004).
The study identified four themes and assessed the differences between stakeholder groups with
respect to the themes: 1) the outcomes for technology transfer that they recognize and the
significance they attribute to those outcomes; 2) the aspects of relationships and networks that they
described as important; 3) the barriers to technology transfer that they identified; and, 4) their
suggestions for improvements (2004). Many participants across the stakeholder groups identified
inadequate rewards for faculty inventors as a barrier to effective technology transfer, and suggested
increasing rewards for inventors in order to improve technology transfer (2004). Academic scientists
and university administrators mainly focused on the lack of rewards for technology transfer in the
promotion and tenure process and some scientists indicated that they felt their shares of the revenues
from technology transfer were too small.
This study provides relatively strong evidence that incentives, including financial incentives, are
likely to be important factors in explaining institutional differences in technology transfer
performance. It is clear from the descriptions that the qualitative analysis was conducted
scrupulously. The only aspect of the study that seems to deviate from accepted practice is the authors
choice to interview multiple stakeholders together. Depending on the ways in which they were
grouped this may have suppressed valuable information. For example, a technology manager is
unlikely to report weak support for technology transfer on the part of the university’s administration if
the administrator to whom he or she reports is also in the room.
The study also provides insight into the ways in which incentives may account for differences in
technology transfer performance across universities. In their discussion of incentives, the authors
provided the following excerpt from an interview with a department chair:
At my former university, faculty members received 60% of the
money from a licence, while here it is 30%. This disparity has not
been helpful, in terms of our ability to recruit and retain faculty
members who are active in this area (2004, p. 135).
This observation suggests that IP policies that offer desirable incentives can improve a university’s
technology transfer performance in three ways: 1) by inducing faculty members to support
technology transfer; 2) by attracting and helping to retain faculty members who are engaged in

<-----Page 42----->29
technology transfer activities; and, 3) through some combination of the first two methods. If this
could be demonstrated to be the case, it would have important policy implications. If the effect of
incentives were primarily achieved through a redistribution of researchers across universities, it
would imply that changing incentives are likely to have little effect on the aggregate level of activity
across a university system, unless the incentives spur shifts across national boundaries.
2.2.3.2.3 Study 3
Renault (2006) designed and administered a survey to assess faculty member’s attitudes towards the
role of the university and the relationship between these attitudes and faculty members experience
with collaboration with industry and patenting, and their interest in forming a spin-off (2006). The
survey was completed over the web by 59 professors, which generated a 14% response rate (2006).
In addition, surveys were completed in interviews with 39 professors (2006). The interviews were
transcribed and used to investigate the differences between the professors when they were grouped
according to the survey results for their attitudes or behaviours (2006). The quantitative data were
used to model the behaviours reported by the professors as a function of their: 1) attitude to
technology transfer; 2) university’s attitude to technology transfer; 3) department’s attitude to
technology transfer; 4) tenure status; 5) publications; 6) field of study (ie. engineering vs. life
sciences); 7) years in academe; 8) share of technology transfer revenues; 9) TTO’s propensity to
submit provisional applications rather than patents, and; 10) TTO’s propensity to patent without first
identifying a licensee (2006).
Only a few of the factors explored in the study proved to be significant. Faculty members attitudes,
their share of technology transfer revenues, and the number of publications produced by a faculty
member were all significant at the .05 level in at least one model (2006). Individual attitudes were a
significant predictor of all three behaviours, revenue shares were significant in predicting both
patenting behaviour and interest in spin-off formation, and publication counts were significant in the
context of patenting (2006). Renault also found qualitative differences between comments made by
the participants with low, medium, and high levels of interest in and acceptance for technology
transfer activities and provides examples that illustrate the differences (2006).
Renault’s study is somewhat difficult to assess. Like the paper by Stevens and Bagby (1999) , her
paper does not provide any information about how the interviews were conducted or the data
analyzed (2006). This undermines the value of both the quantitative and the qualitative findings
because half of the surveys were completed in the context of an interview (2006). Otherwise, her
study design would have provided a good example of the strength of mixed methods; her qualitative
results could be interpreted as evidence that her attitudinal survey has the face validity and thus
strengthened her findings (2006).
2.2.3.2.4 Summary
All three of the papers reviewed in this section provide some evidence that incentives are an
important factor in technology transfer outcomes. The progression of the three papers suggests that
research in this area is moving away from descriptive work towards theory building. Siegel et al.
(2004) demonstrated the power of qualitative research to suggest alternate explanations for

<-----Page 43----->30
phenomena by identifying faculty hiring and retention as a mechanism by which IP policies may
influence technology transfer activity at a university. Renault (2006) contributes to theory building by
demonstrating that faculty attitudes also have an effect on behaviour. This finding suggests that
individual faculty members respond differently to their environment and thus may be contribute to a
more sophisticated model of faculty inventor’s motivation to engage in technology transfer than the
economic agent model implicit in the quantitative models.

2.3 Summary
As can be expected in an emerging and multi-disciplinary research area, the studies are principally
based on similar prior empirical work and not grounded in theory. This lack of theoretical grounding
means that there is not enough information to infer a causal relationship, even in the cases where
there is strong quantitative evidence of a relationship. Consider for example, the contradictory
rationales provided by two of the four studies. DiGregorio and Shane (2003) suggested that lower
shares of licensing revenues may encourage inventors to form spin-offs instead of licensing to explain
the negative relationship they observed between shares of licensing revenues and spin-off formation.
Lockett and Wright suggested higher shares of licensing revenues may stimulate spin-off formation
by communicating the university’s interest and support for technology transfer to university inventors
(2005). In the absence of a theoretical framework, the only way to explore these competing rationales
is through further empirical study and by continuing to seek connections with established theory
outside of this substantive area of study.
There is also a need for the use of more diverse sources of data. In part as a consequence of the
volume of work done in the U.S., most quantitative studies rely on the Association of University
Technology Managers (AUTM) annual survey as their sole source of technology transfer data. This is
significant because the AUTM survey data are self-reported, not audited, and given the increase in
publicity surrounding the results, especially in the business press (e.g. Clifton, 2005; , "Innovation's
golden goose", 2002), the individuals aggregating the statistics may experience pressure to modify
their reporting strategies to present their institutions in the best possible light. As a result, the AUTM
data may not be sufficiently valid and reliable to be the basis of academic work.
There is a need for some of this empirical work to occur in countries other than the U.S. The
studies are consistent with the larger technology transfer literature in that most of the work was
conducted in the U.S. This means that the literature may be overly attuned to factors specific to the
current situation in the U.S. and may not address factors important outside the U.S. For example,
inventor-ownership of IP is unlikely to be identified as a factor in the U.S. because it exists at so few
institutions and, as a result of the Bayh-Dole Act, the inventor ownership policy would only pertain to
the small percentage of research conducted without the use of any governmental funds or resources.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine from U.S. studies whether or not inventor-ownership is
significantly different from university-ownership of IP or in what ways. This is an example of the
need for empirical work that investigates the importance of IP policies in other countries and, in
particular, the need to explore the significance of the incentives provided by university IP policies in
the context of a country like Canada in which there are examples of significantly different university
policies governing technology transfer activities.

<-----Page 44----->Chapter 3
Methodology
A recent review and critique of the academic entrepreneurship literature calls future work to employ
mixed methods research (O'Shea et al., 2004). The rationale provided is that quantitative research is
important in the identification and verification of substantial and generalizable effects but it alone is
not capable of accessing “the complexity and richness of the dynamics of academic entrepreneurship”
in order to “uncover how academics make sense of their decisions” (2004, p. 24). This research is
responsive to these needs; it seeks to gain a better understanding of the research problem by
converging both quantitative and qualitative data. Three studies were used to accomplish this purpose.
Study 1 assesses the impact of university intellectual property policies upon technology transfer
outcomes for Canadian universities. Study 2 assesses the impact of changes to intellectual property
policies at the University of Toronto. Study 3 explores, through in-depth interviews, the perceptions
of experienced academic entrepreneurs at the University of Waterloo. The benefit of the use of mixed
methods design is that each study provides a different perspective on the research question and
therefore the studies should provide a richer description of the phenomenon than would be available
through only one method.
This chapter first discusses the use of mixed methods and its advantages and disadvantages for this
particular research. Then a detailed description is provided of the methods used in the three studies.

3.1 Mixed Methods Research
The three studies in this research use different methods. Studies 1 and 2 involve the analysis of
quantitative data using cross-sectional analysis of aggregate-level data and interrupted time series
analysis of longitudinal data, respectively. Study 3 involves the qualitative analysis of “in-depth”
interviews with experienced academic entrepreneurs (Seidman, 1998). As discussed in Chapter 2,
qualitative analysis of interview data and quantitative analysis of secondary data, including time
series and survey data, have both been used in the study of university-industry technology transfer.
However, they have rarely been used in the course of the same research project as complementary
sources of evidence.
This use of multiple research methods in the course of a research project is referred to as
‘triangulation’ (Denzin, 1959). This term uses the navigation strategy of using multiple reference
points to determine an object’s exact position as a metaphor for the manner in which the use of
different research methodologies allows researchers to describe the phenomenon of interest with more
validity (Smith, 1975). Each individual method is known to have particular strengths and
weaknesses. In mixed methods research, the methods are expected to complement each other such
that the weaknesses of each individual method or data source are mitigated by the strengths of the
other methods and data sources and the overall study gains validity and reliability (Jick, 1979).
In this research, the three studies complement each other in terms of the richness of the information
they provide and the reliability of the overall research. The statistical methods employed in Studies 1
31

<-----Page 45----->32
and 2 provide a reliable assessment of the significance and magnitude of effects associated with
policy differences. This information is critical when assessing possible policy interventions and in
determining the importance of further research in this area. However, these quantitative studies can
not identify why the policies are associated with the observed effects. Study 3 uses a more subjective
qualitative analysis to develop a richer understanding of the link between university IP policies and
university researcher support for technology transfer activities. The analysis of this rich information
provides the basis for a theory of the relationship which informs the interpretation of the quantitative
analysis and is expected to form the basis of future research. In interpreting this theoretical foundation
jointly with the results of more reliable statistical analysis, the overall research results gain reliability
and depth.
The studies also complement each other in a manner that enhances the validity of the overall
research. Internal validity depends on the extent to which the study eliminates rival causes of the
observed relationships (Drucker-Godard et al., 2001). Longitudinal research designs, like Study 2, are
most strongly able to demonstrate causal relationships by permitting analysis of the temporal
relationships between presumed cause and effect. However, the difficulty in obtaining usable time
series of data spanning a policy intervention resulted in an institutional sample size of one, which
limited the study’s external validity or generalizability. By contrast, Study 1 employed a crosssectional design, which offers little ability to assess causal relationships and so has little to contribute
to the question of internal validity; however, it investigated a large sample population and so
contributed to the external validity or generalizablility of the overall research.
In summary, the three studies build upon each other so that the complementary strengths of the
methods result in inferences based upon both objective but shallow quantitative data and a rich
description of the phenomenon. Used jointly, the three methods provide better reliability and validity
than any one design used singly.

3.2 Study 1
The purpose of this study was to assess quantitatively whether or not there is statistical evidence
across Canadian universities of a relationship between university IP policies and university researcher
support for technology transfer. This section describes the data used to assess the relationship of
interest and the methods used in the analysis, and the procedures used to obtain the data.
3.2.1 Sample
There are 98 degree-granting institutions in Canada (Association of University Technology
Managers, 2004). The study was limited to the 48 degree-granting Canadian universities that are
included in the Maclean’s magazine annual university survey for two reasons. Firstly, many of the 98
degree-granting institutions recognized by The Association of Universities and Colleges are affiliates
of the major universities (Association of University Technology Managers, 2004). For example, the
University of St. Michael’s College and the University of Trinity College are affiliates of the
University of Toronto. These affiliates often rely on the larger institutions for a number of functions
including technology transfer support services (Bordt & Read, 1999). Therefore, their inclusion

<-----Page 46----->33
would serve no purpose. Secondly, limiting the study to those universities evaluated by Maclean’s
means that the magazine’s categorization of the universities can be used as a measure of the research
intensity of the universities.
IP Policies were obtained for 37 of the 48 universities; the other eleven universities either did not
have a policy at the time they were collected or did not make their policy available. The resulting
sample includes a broad range of Canadian universities and includes most of the research-intensive
universities in Canada. The 37 universities include 13 of the 16 ‘Medical-doctoral’ universities, 9 of
the 13 ‘Comprehensive’ universities, and 15 of the 21 ‘Primarily undergraduate’ institutions ("The
Rankings", 1999). Thirty of the 37 universities also appear on the RE$EARCH Infosource listing of
the 50 Canadian universities that receive the most research income (RE$EARCH Infosource, 2005).
The main limitation of this sample was the underrepresentation of Québec universities. As shown in
Appendix A, most of the universities that are included on the RE$EARCH Infosource list but not
included in this study are located in Québec.
3.2.2 Data
3.2.2.1 Canadian University IP Policies
After the IP policies were collected, a set of variables was developed to capture differences in the
types and amounts of incentives provided by the policies. The review of the policies revealed that
universities appear to offer their researchers two primary forms of incentives for commercializing
their inventions: shares of revenues and autonomy.
Two different arrangements for sharing licensing revenues are described in most Canadian
intellectual property policies. One sharing arrangement is used if the university develops the
intellectual property and is responsible for the costs of developing the IP. The other sharing
arrangement applies when the inventor commercializes the IP independently, an option that is
sometimes available.
Usually universities that develop the IP will share any revenues after the direct costs of developing
the IP have been repaid. The proportion of these revenues that is provided to the researcher is either
stipulated in the intellectual property policy or negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Instead of
stipulating a single proportion, some universities pay different percentages depending on the amount
of revenue the licence provides. Typically, these universities provide the researcher a large percentage
of the revenues until some threshold is reached, at which point the researcher’s share of all future
revenues falls to a lower percentage.
Some universities require their researchers to share licensing revenues with the school when the
researcher develops the IP independently. When the university requires revenue sharing, the
researcher is usually expected to provide the universities with a certain percentage of the revenues
after the direct costs of developing the IP are repaid. For example, at the University of Alberta,
researchers who choose to commercialize inventions independently of the university are required to
provide the university with one third of the net proceeds of the commercialization of the investment
(University of Alberta, 1991). By contrast, at the University of Waterloo, inventors who choose to

<-----Page 47----->34
commercialize their inventions without the support of the university’s Technology Transfer and
Licensing Office, are under no contractual obligation to share the proceeds of their activities with the
university (University of Waterloo, 1997).
Many universities also make some provision to provide, out of the university’s share of the returns
from the commercialization of university inventions, research funding to future projects in the same
technological area, or to the inventor’s research group, department, or faculty. While these funding
arrangements could be perceived as important incentives by university researchers, they are not good
candidates for a cross-university comparison because the funds are directed to many different
subgroups and the benefit to the researchers involved in the commercialization attempt is sometimes
unclear.
The literature indicates that researchers desire autonomy in the context of university-industry
technology transfer. Campell and Slaughter sought to identify possible sources of conflict arising
from technology transfer activities (Campbell & Slaughter, 1999). Their survey of faculty and
administrators at U.S. universities suggests that “faculty favoured ways to retain their autonomy,
whereas administrators were supportive of greater oversight” with respect to technology transfer”
(1999, p. 343). Segal (1986) suggests that Cambridge’s inventor-ownership IP policy has been a
factor in the development of a high-technology cluster in Cambridge, England. Therefore, policies
that provide the researcher with more control over the technology transfer activities are expected to
act as incentives.
Some universities require researchers to provide the university with a ‘right of first offer’. In this
case, any researcher interested in commercializing an invention must describe the invention to
university administrators in a formal ‘invention disclosure’. If the university representative decides
that the invention seems promising, the university will develop the IP and attempt to commercialize
it. Other “inventor-owner” universities allow the researcher to choose between developing the IP
independently and allowing the university to develop the IP. Since policies that do not reserve a right
of first offer increase the researcher’s control over the technology transfer activity, they are expected
to act as an incentive and thus result in higher levels of technology transfer activity.
Three measures were used to represent each policy: one measure that assessed the degree to which
the policy provides the researcher with autonomy and two measures that evaluated the financial
incentives provided by the policy.
Right of First Offer: This measure was used to evaluate the control that the policies provide to
researchers. It distinguishes between universities at which the university reserves the right of first
offer and those at which inventors determine whether or not the university is involved in the
commercialization of their inventions.
Share of Revenues When University Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
provided to the researcher, when the university commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
Share of Revenues When Inventor Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
retained by the researcher, when the researcher commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
There were three circumstances where it is not possible to record a single percentage for the
researchers’ share of revenues: 1) the percentage provided to the researcher is not specified in

<-----Page 48----->35
advance but negotiated on a case-by-base basis, 2) the university does not support technology
transfer activities by developing IP, and 3) the revenue sharing agreement is structured using
thresholds, above which the researcher’s share of the revenue changes.
The data that describes the intellectual property policies of the sample of Canadian universities are
included in Appendix A and described in Section 4.1.
3.2.2.2 University Research Intensity
The research intensity of the universities is expected to influence the level of technology transfer
activity supported by each university by affecting the availability of patentable technology. Therefore,
the universities’ research intensity was used as a control variable in assessing the relationship
between university intellectual property policies and university-industry technology transfer.
University research intensity was represented using the Maclean’s categorization system for
Canadian universities. This system represents universities as members of one of three groups that
Maclean’s describes as follows:
The Medical Doctoral universities are those with a broad range of
PhD programs and research, as well as medical schools. The
Comprehensive universities are those with a significant amount of
research activity and a wide range of programs at the undergraduate
and graduate levels, including professional degrees. The Primarily
Undergraduate universities are those largely focused on
undergraduate education, with relatively few graduate programs.
("Reading the Rankings", 1999)
This grouping appears to capture several correlated aspects of scientific research intensity. The data
gathered by the universities for use by Maclean’s magazine were investigated to verify that there is a
relationship between the Maclean’s university typology and research intensity, measured by the
number of faculty members actively engaged in research of the type funded by the Natural Science
and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Canadian Institute of Health Research
(CIHR) research, the number of grants received and amount the research money available to the
faculty in support of their research. As shown in the following table, there is evidence of a
relationship between the university classification and all three measures of university research
intensity.

3.2.2.3 Technology Transfer Outcomes
While there are no canonical measures for the success of technology transfer initiatives, simple counts
of patents, licences, and spin-off companies (Brett et al., 1991; Expert Panel on the
Commercialization of University Research, 1999), ratios of these counts (Gregory & Sheahen, 1991)
and revenues associated with licensing and spin-off activities are often used as indicators (Brett et al.,
1991; Expert Panel on the Commercialization of University Research, 1999). Since the purpose of
this study was to determine how university policy is related to university technology transfer through
faculty support, the measure of technology transfer should be most dependent on actions within the
university. For this reason, measures like patent counts are more appropriate than licensing revenues,
which also depend on external factors such as the existence of receptor capacity, and the state of the
market. The number of Canadian or U.S. patents currently held by a university is a publicly available
measure. The Statistics Canada surveys indicated that the majority of the patents obtained by
Canadian universities are U.S. patents. Therefore, the number of U.S. patents currently held by a
Canadian university was used as the measure of technology licensing activity.
The search for U.S. patents held by the 48 Canadian universities of interest identified a total of
1290 U.S. patents currently held by Canadian universities. The Statistics Canada 1999 survey
reported that 81 Canadian universities held 635 U.S. patents by 1998 and 84 Canadian universities
held 948 U.S. patents by 1999 (Bordt & Read, 1999). The difference between the 1999 patent count
provided by Statistics Canada and the patent count provided by this study may be a function of the
time that elapsed between the completion of the Statistics Canada study and the start of this study.
The data were collected in late 2000 resulting in a time difference of about a year. Alternatively,
patents developed by the research hospitals associated with Canadian universities may have appeared
in the patent counts in this study and artificially increased the results for the universities affiliated
with research hospitals.

<-----Page 50----->37
3.2.3 Procedures
The data used in this study were collected in October and November of 2000, principally from online
sources. This section describes the data gathering procedures for the IP policies and U.S. patent
counts.
Most Canadian universities post their policy statements on their web pages. Therefore, the IP
policies were gathered by searching university websites for the relevant policy. When no policy was
found, the university’s TTO was contacted to request a copy of the policy. Policies were obtained for
37 of the 48 universities. Three universities indicated that they did not have an IP policy, seven more
universities had no IP policy posted on their web site and failed to respond to a request for the policy,
and in one case only an incomplete copy of the policy was obtained.
U.S. patent counts were obtained through university-specific searches of the Delphion Intellectual
Property Network online searchable patent database. For each university a search was conducted for
all U.S. patents with the university name listed as the assignee. The resulting patent counts are
presented in Appendix B. Unfortunately, this search method will not identify patents that are
independently developed by university faculty members. Therefore, there is a high probability that the
patenting activities at inventor-owner institutions were underestimated compared to patenting
activities at university-owner institutions. This bias could not be addressed by requesting information
directly from Canadian universities or by using existing surveys like the AUTM Annual Survey
because most universities fail to track independently-developed technologies in a systematic fashion.
This outcome variable also fails to capture inventions that are best protected with other forms of IP
protection, like software. This flaw may bias the results if the amount of technology transfer activity
associated with the commercialization of unpatentable inventions varies across universities differently
than technology transfer activities associated with the commercialization of patentable inventions. It
is unlikely that this bias will have a significant impact on the overall assessment because, as discussed
in section 2.1.1, patenting is by far the dominant form of IP protection in Canada.
The results of the analysis of the relationship between the policy variables and the count of U.S.
patents are documented in Chapter 4.

3.3 Study 2
The purpose of this study was to assess quantitatively whether or not university IP policies have a
statistically significant and substantial impact on university researcher support for technology transfer
by evaluating the impact of university IP policy interventions. This section describes the data used to
assess the impact of policy interventions and the methods used in the analysis.
3.3.1 Sample
Interrupted time series analyses require a time series spanning the intervention and during which no
other significant changes occurred. This meant that the policy intervention must have occurred at least
a decade earlier than this study was conducted and that the university had started actively supporting
and tracking technology transfer substantially before the policy shift.

<-----Page 51----->38
Six universities were identified that had had changes of policy during the time period of interest:
Queen’s University, Ryerson University, the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the
University of Toronto, and the University of Western Ontario. Of these six institutions, only the
University of Toronto had a viable data set. Queen’s University was not appropriate for further study
because PARTEQ Research and Development Innovations, a non-profit corporation dedicated to
technology transfer activities, started serving the university only a couple of years before the policy
change (Queen's University, 2000). Any attempt to assess the impact of the policy intervention is
likely to be confounded by the effects of the founding of PARTEQ. Ryerson’s policy was effectively
changed in September, 2003, when a binding agreement with the faculty association overruled the
existing policy, at least as it pertained to faculty. While it will be interesting to observe the impact of
their unusual arrangement in which the university and faculty members share ownership of all
innovations commercialized with the support of the university, too few data are available to do a time
series analysis (Ryerson University, 1990). The University of Alberta’s policy was last updated in
1991. While technology transfer measures were collected prior to 1992, TEC Edmonton did not
provide the data because they were collected prior to the establishment of TEC Edmonton and thus
their reliability could not be verified (Freeman, 2006). The University of Calgary updated its policy in
1988 and 1992, but the limited data collected in the years before these interventions cannot be
compared against the technology transfer measures from the period after the policy change because
technology transfer support services were only made available in 1989 (Association of University
Technology Managers, 2004). The University of Western Ontario did not begin to provide technology
transfer support services to the entire campus prior to 1995/1996 and no data were collected in a
systematic fashion prior to 1993/1994 (Walzak, 2006). Therefore, data were not available to examine
the impact of the 1983 policy change from a “university-owns” to an “inventor-owns” policy at the
University of Western Ontario. The University of Toronto TTO had tracked invention disclosures
since 1975, which meant that a data set was available to assess the impact of the 1990 policy change
from a “university-owns” to an “inventor-owns” university. Since the University of Toronto is the
only university that offered a viable data set, it is the focus of this study.
3.3.2 Data
Invention disclosures are the formal disclosure of a potentially commercializable invention made by
an inventor to a university. The annual counts of invention disclosures at the University of Toronto
were the focus of this study for two reasons. Firstly, under both the old and new policies, faculty
members have been required to submit an invention disclosure to the university at the start of any
commercialization process. Therefore, the university’s counts of invention disclosures track the
activity at the university including any independently-developed technologies. Secondly, unlike
patents, licences, and spin-offs, invention disclosures are created shortly after the faculty members
decide to commercialize a technology and do not rely heavily on the availability of commercialization
resources, such as investment capital, funds for prototype development and intellectual property
protection, and business expertise. As a result, the number of invention disclosures reported at a
university is more closely linked to researcher support for technology transfer than the other outcome
variables that are currently tracked, such as licence revenue and returns from the realization of spinoff equity. The main limitation of this choice of measure is the lack of a direct link to any of the

<-----Page 52----->39
desired outcomes for technology transfer, including improvements to goods and services stemming
from the use the innovation or economic benefits in the region or the nation that result from the
commercialization.
3.3.3 Procedures
The data were obtained directly from the University of Toronto TTO. A meeting was held with
technology managers in the office to determine whether or not this study is an appropriate use of the
data, prior to the release of the data. To verify the validity of the data further and to obtain
information on the historical context of the policy shift, Office of Research Ethics approval was
obtained for interviews with technology managers and a university technology manager, who worked
at the University of Toronto TTO during the time period of interest, was interviewed.
According to this university technology manager, there were two important changes to invention
disclosure management that were not directly related to the policy change. Prior to the policy change,
no early consulting was done to determine whether university research was ready to be disclosed.
After the policy change, university researchers would be advised not to disclose in a number of
circumstances, including cases where the technology had not yet been reduced to practice. This
change is expected to make tests of the policy change more conservative because it will result in an
underestimate of the number of instances, after the policy change, in which university researchers
sought to make a disclosure. The second change in the management of invention disclosures was a
streamlining of the disclosure form itself, which reduced it in length from about eight pages to two
pages, shortly after the policy change. This change could be expected to increase the number of
invention disclosures to the university. Therefore, any apparent shift in the number of invention
disclosures must be considered the joint effect of the policy change and the streamlining of the
invention disclosure form. Apart from these changes, the management of invention disclosures was
consistent from year to year. No other relevant changes were identified. For example, the amount of
funds available for technology transfer at the University of Toronto remained relatively stable until
after 2000. Since no other explanations for a change in the number of invention disclosures per year
were discovered, any significant changes observed between 1991 and 2000 can be assumed to be a
consequence of the policy change and the change to the invention disclosure forms.
The data analysis proceeded in two stages. In Exploratory Data Analysis, the data were visually
inspected to investigate important properties of the data and to determine the subset of models most
likely to model the time series adequately. Three types of plots were used to investigate the time
series of University of Toronto invention disclosures: graphs of the raw and smoothed data against
time, and box-and-whisker plots. In Confirmatory Data Analysis, tests were conducted to assess the
fit of the models. The statistical analysis of the impact of an intervention upon a time series can be
approached using regression methods, ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average)
methods, and non-parametric tests (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). ARIMA methods are often the first
choice but the data set did not contain enough observations for the use of these methods. Nonparametric tests are less able to provide nuanced descriptive information and less sensitive than
parametric (i.e. regression) methods and thus less likely to detect significant results. Therefore, the

<-----Page 53----->40
analysis was based on the application of regression methods. The results of these analyses are
presented in Chapter 5.

3.4 Study 3
The study seeks to discover how university researchers’ understand their technology transfer
experiences, and to share this perspective in the researcher’s own words as much as possible. This
qualitative study should increase understanding of both the ways in which university intellectual
property policies influence researcher’s willingness to support technology transfer and the relative
importance of these effects. Therefore, this study is expected to identify theories that can be used to
explain aspects of the relationship between IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.
3.4.1 Methodology
The goal of a phenomenological study is to describe the meaning of a phenomenon as constructed by
a small number of individuals who have experienced the same phenomenon (Creswell, 1998, p.122).
This goal meshes well with the research question in this study: how do university researchers’
understand their technology transfer experience? Therefore, the research approach will be grounded
in a phenomenological tradition.
The research methodology closely follows the in-depth interviewing methods described by Seidman
(1998). His approach is grounded in the phenomenological tradition and has been used to investigate
how college educators understand their work experiences. Therefore, it appears appropriate for use in
an examination of how university researchers understand technology transfer experiences, as an
element of their work experience.
3.4.2 Participants
In designing qualitative studies, researchers must make decisions that affect the balance between the
breadth and depth of a study. Since the purpose of this study was a deep investigation of researcher’s
understandings of technology transfer, the study was limited to a single university. The University of
Waterloo was selected because of the university's intellectual property policy and the university’s
reputation for high levels of university-industry technology transfer. Unlike many other universities,
Waterloo's IP policy confers complete ownership upon inventors within the faculty. This permits the
broadest range of technology transfer experiences. Furthermore, Waterloo’s intellectual property
policy has often been linked to the relatively large number of spin-offs associated with this
moderately-sized institution (Cross & Babensee, 1992, 1994). In order to explore this link, purposive
sampling was employed in the selection of participants.
Purposive sampling is the norm in qualitative research, especially in phenomenological studies, in
which the participants must have had the same experience (Seidman, 1998). By deliberately selecting
participants with a certain set of experiences, the researcher engages in what Miles and Huberman
refer to as criterion sampling (1994). In order to explore the link between the university IP and policy
and spin-off formation, the participants were restricted to the cohort that introduced spin-off creation
to the University of Waterloo and most of the participants were chosen for their involvement in spin-

<-----Page 54----->41
off activities. The cohort that introduced spin-offs to the University of Waterloo consists of senior
and retired faculty members. When this thesis was written in 2006, the average age of the participants
was 69 years, average number of years that the participants had been professors was 28, and the
retired professors had between retired for eight years, on average. For comparison purposes,
participants were also included who had engaged in licensing to established firms, or who had done
significant development work through research contracts or industrial positions while on leave from
their academic postings.
Potential participants were identified using news articles and contacts within the university
community. An effort was made to identify and include unsuccessful technology transfer attempts for
comparison purposes. These were more difficult to identify. As a result, most of the projects in which
participants had been involved were successful in both in generating a return for the inventors and
making the technology available to users and, thus, making the advantages of the innovation available
to the public.
As a result of the gender imbalance among senior and retired professors, especially in the technical
disciplines (Sussman & Yssaad, 2005), the participants within this study were all male. This was
accepted because even if a female participant meeting the various criteria could have been identified,
it would be exceedingly difficult to protect her identity.
One of the difficulties in investigating a topic that has become highly political is the possibility that
the participants will be too involved in impression management to speak frankly. In order to avoid
this possibility, the participants were assured that their anonymity would be preserved in the
presentation of the research results. Several participants would not have participated without this
assurance thus it proved to be an important aspect of the research design.
Seidman refuses to provide a guideline for the appropriate number of participants, stating instead
that the researcher should seek a saturation of the information (1998). Creswell suggests that
phenomenological studies are often quite small in size and that ten participants should often suffice
(1998). Therefore, ten participants, who are senior and retired faculty from the University of
Waterloo, and experienced in technology transfer, were interviewed in this study.
3.4.3 Data Collection
In accordance with Seidman's guidelines, the data collection consisted in taping and transcribing a
series of three interviews with each participant (1998). The first interview provided general life
history information, the second interview provided details of the participant’s experiences in
technology transfer and the final interview offered the participant an opportunity to reflect on his
experiences (Seidman, 1998). This structure provided the researcher with an opportunity to learn
about how the participant makes sense of some of his experiences, in the context of both those
experiences and his life history (Seidman, 1998). The successive interviews were usually spaced
about a week apart.
Each interview began with an expanded prompt that reminded the participant of the structure of the
interviews and the theme of the current interview. The interview themes and some sample prompts
are listed in Table 6. The subsequent interview was then largely directed by the participant.

<-----Page 55----->42
Occasionally follow-up questions would be posed to clarify descriptions that the participants had
provided. For example, if the participant had commented that the university environment was
supportive of technology transfer the follow-up questions may have included: ‘What aspects of the
university environment were supportive?’ or ‘Were there any aspects of the university environment
that weren’t supportive?’ Follow-up questions were used most frequently in the last interview of the
series. In that interview, participants were occasionally asked about factors that other participants had
identified, including intellectual property policies to allow the researcher to compare perspectives in
the thematic analysis.

<-----Page 56----->43
Table 6. Interview Themes and Typical Questions.
Theme

Typical Prompts

Life History, in
particular,
Career History

In this first of the three interviews, what I’d really like to do is find out about you:
find out about your career history and find out about your life history. The goal of
doing so is to give me the opportunity to ask more interesting questions in our next
interview where we’ll focus on your technology transfer experiences. Then in the
final interview we’ll focus on the things you have learned, what you would want to
share, what you think other people should know. The objective of having an open
ended interview is to allow you to discuss the things that you think are really
important for me to know. The reason for the staged approach is to give me a
better opportunity to do a good job of understanding what you have to say in later
interviews and asking those good questions. On that note, I’d invite you to tell me
about yourself and to start wherever you think would be appropriate.

Technology
Transfer
Experiences

When we met last time we talked about your career history. You provided me with
an overview of your career. What I’d like to do today is to invite you to talk a little
bit more about your experiences with the technology transfer projects you
identified. What project would you like to discuss first? Why did you decide to
become involved with that project?
In our past interviews, we talked about your overall career and focused on your
technology transfer activities, especially Project X. In this final interview, what I’d
really like to do is move on to find out what you’re most proud of, what you’d like
other people to know, and what you learned from your experiences.

Reflection on
Experiences

What stands out in your mind when you think about your technology transfer
experiences?
What would you want to tell a colleague who is considering taking on a technology
transfer project to know?
Given what you have said about your career and your technology transfer
experiences, is there anything you wish had been different? Is there anything that
surprised you?

The interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes each. As a result, each participant was interviewed
for about 3 hours. The interviews were recorded using both a digital and an analog recorder. The best
recording was provided to professional transcribers and a copy of the transcription was provided to
the participants for their review. Altogether, the interviews took 24.5 hours and resulted in 431 pages
of transcripts.

<-----Page 57----->44
3.4.4 Data Analysis
3.4.4.1 Profiles and vignettes
The first step in the data analysis was the development of profiles for each of the participants because
"crafting a profile or a vignette of a participant's experience is an effective way of sharing interview
data and opening up one's interview material to analysis and interpretation" (Seidman, 1998). The
profiles were created by repeatedly culling the most interesting excerpts from the transcripts for a
series of interviews with a single participant. Content was most likely to be selected for inclusion in a
profile if it was clear from the wording and tone that the participant felt strongly about the subject, or
if the participant brought up the subject unprompted, or revisited the topic multiple times over the
course of the interviews.
In the creation of the profiles, the transcripts were left in the participant's own words as much as
possible while preserving the participant’s dignity. Oral speech is often ungrammatical and can
include many repeated words and filler works like ‘umm’ and ‘ahh’. The inclusion of these aspects of
oral speech in written transcripts can make the participant appear inarticulate and thus appear
disrespectful. Therefore, Seidman (1998) recommends editing the final set of excerpts in order to
preserve the participant's dignity. Filler words and repeated words were omitted. Small grammatical
changes were made; for example, verb tenses were corrected. Occasionally transitional text was
included to replace filler words or to bridge between two excerpts from the transcripts.
The profiles also needed to be edited to protect the participant’s anonymity. All person, place or
organizational names, which could be used to identify the participant, were replaced. For example,
proper names were often replaced with the individual’s job title (“Kate Hoye” becomes “a Ph.D.
student”); if the job titles had changed over time the most recent naming convention was used.
Descriptive phrases that could be used to identify the technology transfer activity and hence the
participant were replaced with more generic descriptions. For example, “the technology” or “the
tools we developed” might be used in place of a description of reference to a spin-off’s launch
product. An effort was also made to edit out any unusual phrases that participants appeared to use
regularly because these ‘catch-phrases’ might be identifying marks.
After the edits were completed, a review of the profiles identified as a concern that several profiles
may allow readers familiar with the University of Waterloo community to identify the participants.
Take for example a profile that contains three stories: one story that may identify the participant’s
faculty; another that may identify the type of technology transfer that the participant engaged in; and
a third that discusses attributes of the market for the technology that was transferred. Separately none
of the three stories could be used to discover the participant’s identity but, together, the three stories
may allow people familiar with the University of Waterloo to identify the participant. Therefore, it
was decided that the profiles would not be displayed such that each profile is a continuous block in
the usual manner (e.g. Seidman, 1985). Instead, after the thematic analysis, each profile would be
divided thematically into vignettes and the vignettes would be displayed by theme with no
information provided to link multiple vignettes to a single participant. These arrangements are
expected to allow the presentation of a rich set of data while still preserving the anonymity of the
participants.

<-----Page 58----->45
3.4.4.2 Thematic data analysis
The second step in the analysis was thematic data analysis of the profiles. Unlike quantitative
research, qualitative research is often inductive. In Seidman’s thematic data analysis process, the data
themselves suggest the constructs and the relationships between constructs (1998). This was done
through immersion in the data in which the texts were read and coded with descriptive words and
phrases (1998). Through the analysis process, these constructs appeared, merged, changed, and
disappeared until it appeared that all of the relevant aspects of the data had been captured (1998). The
emphasis in this analysis process was on identifying pervasive trends and reconciling them with
contradictory or inconsistent passages (Seidman, 1998). The resulting themes are illustrated by the
vignettes in Appendix F and discussed in Chapter 6.
3.4.4.3 In-depth interviewing, reliability and validity
Seidman has noted that the in-depth interviewing protocol is structured to produce reasonably reliable
and valid results (1998). The structure of the interviews provides context for the participant's
comments which the researcher can use to produce more reliable results (1998). The internal
consistency of the results was a focus during the development of the profiles; topics were most likely
to be included in the profiles if they were introduced in multiple sessions or if they espoused views
that appeared consistent with the content of the other interviews. This approach is expected to reduce
the possibility that a participant was intentionally or unintentionally misleading or that a profile is
strongly affected by a participant’s mood during a single interview. Therefore, this focus is expected
to increase the reliability of the results. Validity was the focus during the thematic analysis. Valid
constructs most likely to be identified when researchers looking for themes across participants (1998).
In order to demonstrate the analytical rigor with which this analysis was conducted, the themes are
illustrated with as many vignettes as possible so that interested parties can explore the relationship
between the underlying data and the themes identified in the study.

3.5 Conclusions
This research is structured using a mixed method design. The purpose of this approach is to
understand the research problem better by analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. Three
studies were used to accomplish this purpose. Study 1 is a quantitative study using a cross-sectional
design to investigate the relationship between IP policies and the level of university technology
transfer activity. Study 2 is a quantitative study using a longitudinal design to assess the impact of a
change in the University of Toronto’s IP policy upon researcher support for technology transfer at
that university. Study 3 is a qualitative exploration of the perceptions of experienced academic
entrepreneurs at the University of Waterloo. The benefit of the use of mixed methods design is that
each study provides a different perspective on the research question and therefore the studies should
provide a richer description of the phenomenon than would be available through only one method. All
three studies seek to advance our understanding of the research question, namely: What relationship
exists between university intellectual property policies and university-industry technology transfer?
The results of the studies are presented in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6, respectively.

<-----Page 59----->Chapter 4
Study 1: Cross-Sectional Study of Canadian Universities
This chapter contains the results of a cross-sectional assessment of the relationship between university
IP policies and aggregate university-industry technology transfer outcomes. The purpose of this study
is to assess quantitatively whether or not university IP policies have a significant and substantial
impact on university researcher support for technology transfer.
The chapter has three sections. The first section describes the IP policies held by the 37 Canadian
universities in the sample population. The second section quantitatively analyzes the relationship
between these policies and technology transfer outcomes. The third section presents a discussion of
these results.

4.1 Description of the IP Policies held by Canadian Universities
The first step in this study was the collection of intellectual property policies held by the 37 degreegranting Canadian universities in the sample population. A complete listing of the universities and the
descriptive variables for their IP policies is provided in Appendix A. This section describes four
aspects of the policies that govern the incentives offered to university researchers who engage in
technology transfer. The four aspects are: 1) whether or not the universities reserve the right of first
offer on IP arising from university research, 2) the researcher’s share of the revenues when the
university commercializes the invention, 3) the researcher’s share of the revenues when the researcher
commercializes the invention, and 4) the threshold structures used by some universities to create
different revenue sharing agreements for different amounts of revenue.
4.1.1 Right of First Offer
Right of first offer refers to the practice on the part of some universities of reserving the right to
evaluate all university inventions that inventors are interested in having commercialized and to own
and develop any inventions that the university deems commercializable. Since policies that do not
reserve a right of first offer increase the researcher’s control over the technology transfer activity,
they are expected to act as an incentive and thus result in higher levels of technology transfer activity.
Right of first offer is only possible at the universities that have TTOs or some other capacity for
reviewing applications and supporting patenting, licensing and spin-off activities. According to the
available policies, seven of the 37 universities do not commercialize inventions and thus could not
consider requiring a right of first offer.
Of the 30 universities that can support technology transfer, 13 reserve the right of first offer and
thus are classified as “university-owner” universities and 17 universities do not reserve the right of
first offer. It is important to note that “university-owner” universities allow the inventors to determine
whether or not to pursue commercialization. However, inventors who are interested in
commercializing their inventions in these institutions are required to give the university the
46

<-----Page 60----->47
opportunity to assess the invention and decide whether or not the university will commercialize the
invention using its resources. The inventors can only commercialize the invention independently if
the university decides it is not interested in commercializing the invention. Several universities still
retain some control of inventions that are being commercialized independently. For example, at
McGill University, faculty inventors need to obtain university approval to license inventions that they
are commercializing without assistance from the university TTO (McGill University, 1985).
4.1.2 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the University Commercializes the
Invention
University policies often define the share of the revenue that is provided to the inventors when the
university commercializes an invention arising from university research. These clauses are only
included at the 30 universities that have the capacity to support technology transfer. Of these 30
universities, 21 offer guidelines for the percentage of the net income that the institution will share
with faculty inventors, including four that structure the revenue sharing using thresholds. The other 9
universities negotiate revenue sharing arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Of the 17 universities
that offer guidelines but do not structure them using thresholds, twelve universities set the
researchers’ share at 50% of net income. Three universities in this group set the researchers’ share at
a lower level; the University of Toronto, the University of Alberta and Queen’s University set the
researchers’ share at 25%, 33Z %, and 40%, respectively. Two universities set the researchers’ share
at above 50%; at McGill University and Simon Fraser University, researchers are entitled to 65% and
80%, respectively, of the net income derived from the commercialization of their inventions.
Of the five universities that diverge from the 50% revenue sharing norm, four are ‘MedicalDoctoral’ universities and all five are in the top 25 universities when ordered by research spending
(RE$EARCH Infosource, 2005). This suggests that there is greater diversity in the policies held by
the more research-intensive universities, perhaps because these institutions started developing
intellectual property policies and technology transfer support systems before the norms emerged.
The universities that do not reserve the right of first offer have a wider range of revenue sharing
arrangements than the universities that do reserve the right of first offer and they are more likely to
hold policies that set the sharing lower than the norm value of 50%. Three of the ten “inventorowner” universities provide the researcher with less than 50% and one “inventor-owner” university
provides the researcher with more than 50%. One of the seven “university-owner” universities
diverges from the norm value of 50% and it sets the researcher’s share above 50%. This suggests that,
in devising the policies, administrators in “inventor-owner” institutions may have chosen to take
higher shares of financial returns in exchange for providing researchers with more autonomy in
technology transfer activities.
4.1.3 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the Researcher Commercializes the
Invention
Typically, university policies define the share of the revenue that is provided to the inventors when
the inventor commercializes an invention arising from university research without the support of

<-----Page 61----->48
university technology transfer services. Independent commercialization by inventors can occur at
university-owner institutions when the university has decided it is not interested in pursuing
commercialization, and at inventor-owner institutions when the inventor decides not to involve the
university in the commercialization.
Policies governing the inventor’s share of the revenues, when the inventor commercializes an
invention arising from university research, were identified in 36 of the 37 policies collected. Of the 36
universities with relevant policy statements, five universities negotiate revenue sharing on a case-bycase basis, and three universities stage the researcher’s share using thresholds. Of the 28 universities
that offer guidelines for the researcher’s share but do not structure their guidelines using thresholds,
19 universities set the researchers’ share at 100% of net income. In the remaining nine, four
universities set the researcher’s share at 50% of net income, three universities set the researcher’s
share at 75%, and the University of Alberta and St. Francis Xavier University set the researchers’
share at 66.6% and 85 %, respectively.
Again, the universities that do not reserve the right of first offer have a wider range of revenue
sharing arrangements than the universities that do reserve the right of first offer and they are more
likely to hold policies that set the sharing lower than the norm value of 50%. Only one of the nine
“university-owner” universities sets the researcher’s share below 100%, whereas eight of the nineteen
“inventor-owner” universities offer a smaller share of the revenue to the researcher. This is consistent
with the earlier supposition that, in devising the policies, administrators may have chosen to take
higher shares of financial returns in exchange for providing researchers with more autonomy in
technology transfer activities and vice versa.
4.1.4 Thresholds for Revenue Sharing
Of the 37 universities, six institutions structure their guidelines for revenue sharing using thresholds
based on the net income from the commercialization. The revenue sharing guidelines for these six
universities are outlined in Table 7.

Sources: (Acadia University, 2000; McGill University, 1985; Memorial University of
Newfoundland, 1996; University of Guelph, 1991; University of Ottawa, 1997; University of Western
Ontario, 1983).
For the cases in which the university commercializes an invention, all four of the universities that
have tiered revenue sharing agreements offer an initial rate at or above the norm of 50%. As
thresholds are reached, the researcher’s share of the net income decreases. The final rate for the four
universities ranges between 25% and 50%, which are the lowest rate and the norm for universities
without tiered revenue sharing arrangements, respectively. In the many cases where the return from
the commercialization is not substantial, these revenue sharing agreements provide a more significant
financial reward to the researcher than is the norm, and they ensure that the university will benefit
most in the rare cases where the return on the invention is worth millions of dollars.
Memorial University of Newfoundland has a tiered revenue sharing agreement for use in the cases
where researchers commercialize their inventions independently. Since Memorial reserves the right of
first offer, this tiered agreement will only apply when the university has determined that it is not
interested in commercializing the invention. The inventor’s highest percentage share in the tiered
agreement (75%) is lower than the norm of among other universities (100%). However, faculty might

<-----Page 63----->50
see these incentives as equitable because the financial incentives offered by the Memorial policy to
the commercializing entity are the same regardless of whether it is the inventor or the university that
commercializes the invention.
McGill University also has a tiered revenue sharing agreement for use in the cases where
researchers commercialize their inventions independently. McGill reserves the right of first offer;
however, faculty members can request permission to commercialize their inventions independently.
The policy at McGill appears to offer little financial incentive to commercialize independently of the
university. In exchange for accepting the risk of commercialization, the inventors will receive at most
$15,000 more than they would have if the university had developed the invention.
Acadia also has a tiered revenue sharing agreement for use in the cases where researchers
commercialize their inventions independently. Acadia is one of the seven Primarily Undergraduate
universities that had not developed technology transfer support services by 2000. Five of the
Primarily Undergraduate universities claim up to 50% of the net income derived from these activities
while providing no support for technology transfer activities. These IP policies seem to be designed
to allow the university to benefit from whatever technology transfer activities might occur without the
university’s support; they are not primarily designed to encourage technology transfer.
4.1.5 Summary of IP Policies
Canadian universities currently hold a wide range of intellectual property policies, with most of the
diversity derived from the way in which the policies are structured as opposed to the percentages of
financial incentives offered by the policies. Many of IP policies studied preserve institutional
flexibility by permitting the university to make arrangements on a case-by-case basis, and several
more offered tiered financial incentives. These policies differ from those that specify a percentage
share in terms of the structure of the policy. Among the universities that specify revenue sharing
agreements without using thresholds, there is little diversity in the percentage shares provided to
researchers by the policies that specify revenue sharing arrangements. The majority of the universities
that specify the researcher’s share of revenues assign the researcher half of the revenues after the
repayment of IP development costs if the university develops the IP. An even larger majority assigns
all of the revenues to the researcher if the researcher develops the IP independently.

4.2 Analysis
This section presents an analysis of the impact of the university IP policies on the amount of
technology transfer activity. Counts of the U.S. patents held by each university are used as the
measure of the amount of technology transfer activity at each institution because patenting relies less
on the availability of resources external to the university than licensing revenues or counts of spinoffs. U.S. patents were chosen because the U.S. is the jurisdiction in which Canadian universities are
most likely to patent inventions (Bordt & Read, 1999; Read, 2000, 2003, 2005). Three policy
variables representing different incentives provided to researchers were investigated: 1) whether or
not the universities reserve the right of first offer on IP arising from university research; 2) the

<-----Page 64----->51
researcher’s share of the revenues when the university commercializes the invention; and 3) the
researcher’s share of the revenues when the researcher commercializes the invention.
The first part of this section presents an exploratory analysis of the respondent variable, U.S. patent
counts. This analysis is followed by an investigation of the relationships between the respondent
variable and the four explanatory variables: first the control variable, Maclean’s institutional type, and
then each of the three policy variables. In each case, the relationship is first explored using graphical
methods and descriptive statistics to determine if statistical tests are likely to be productive. Where
warranted, statistical tests are chosen based on the characteristics of the data.
4.2.1 U.S. Patent Counts
Exploratory data analysis of the response variable is an important precursor to tests of the relationship
between explanatory variables and the response variable because it permits the identification of
important qualities of the data (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). Descriptive statistics and a histogram were
generated of the U.S. patent counts for the Canadian universities in the sample population to permit
an investigation of the properties of the response variable (M=30.9, SD=52.9, Mdn=6. 0,
skewness=2.67). As Figure 1 shows, the distribution of patent counts is substantially positively
skewed; instead of having the symmetrical bell shape of the normal distribution, the bell is slanted so
that the right tail extends much further from the center of the bell than the left. The Shapiro-Wilk test
of normality confirms that the distribution is not normal (SW=.644,p<.001). This result means that
nonparametric tests should be used whenever possible.

4.2.2 University Research Intensity
University research intensity is expected to be an important determinant of the amount of technology
transfer activity at a university because it will have a direct effect on the number of commercializable
inventions arising from research at that university. A small university with few graduate level
programs and little research funding is considerably less likely to have the opportunity to transfer
technology than a larger university with many graduate level programs and a lot of research funding.
As described in section 3.2.2.2, the Maclean’s typology (Medical-Doctoral, Comprehensive,
Primarily Undergraduate) was used to capture the research intensity of the various universities so that
it can be employed as a control variable in studying the relationship between policy variables and
technology transfer outcomes.
As the box plots in Figure 2 suggest, there is a sizeable difference between the numbers of patents
held by universities in the three groups. The mean number of patents held by Medical-Doctoral,
Comprehensive, and Primarily Undergraduate universities is 73.3, 19.6, and 0.3, respectively. The
Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric test of the difference of means of two or more populations,
indicated that these differences are significant (42=28.2, p<.001). This result is strong evidence the
U.S. patent counts capture important differences among the universities.
Also evident from the box plots in Figure 2, is the small number of patents held by Primarily
Undergraduate universities. Only three of these universities held U.S. patents. The University of
Prince Edward Island held two patents, and the University of Northern British Columbia and the
University of Winnipeg each held one patent. These very small patent counts indicate that the group
of Primarily Undergraduate universities was not engaged in technology transfer activities by 2000.
Therefore, these universities will not be included in further investigations of the relationship between
university IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.

4.2.3 Right of First Offer
Institutional right of first offer is only possible at the universities that have TTOs or some other
capacity for reviewing applications and supporting patenting, licensing and spin-off activities. The
sample contains 19 Comprehensive or Medical-Doctoral universities that have the capacity to
commercialize inventions that arise from university research. These universities are the focus of this
investigation.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the patent counts held by two subgroups of this sample:
universities that reserve a right of first offer and universities that do not reserve a right of first offer.
As shown in Table 8, the universities that reserve the right of first offer hold, on average, almost
exactly the same number of U.S. patents as the universities that do not reserve the right of first offer.
However, the similarity of the means can not be directly interpreted because of the high variance. The
high skewness and kurtosis of the distributions suggest that the distributions both contain influential
outliers. This implies that both sets of universities have many universities that hold relatively few
patents and a smaller number that hold many patents.

The Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric test, was used to assess whether or not the means of the
two subpopulations are significantly different. This non-parametric test was not significant
(42=0.060,p=.806). Therefore, there is no evidence that the two subpopulations are different.
In order to investigate further the apparent absence of evidence of a relationship between ‘right of
first offer’ and the number of U.S. patents held by the various universities, this relationship was also
explored using research intensity as a control variable. As shown in Figure 3, further splitting the
universities into groups of Comprehensive and Medical-Doctoral universities, to account for the
differences in research intensity, does not provide any evidence of differences between the
universities that reserve the right of first offer and those who do not.
In summary, there is no evidence of a relationship between the right of first offer and the
respondent variable, U.S. patent counts. If there is such a relationship, it could be obscured by the
relationship between the inventor’s share of the revenue from university-commercialized inventions
and right of first offer. Therefore, the relationship between right of first offer and U.S. patents counts
is re-examined in conjunction with the researcher’s share of revenues from university-commercialized
inventions in the next section.

4.2.4 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the University Commercializes the
Invention
The analysis of the relationship between the financial incentives and the U.S. patent counts at each
institution is restricted to the universities that specified their revenue sharing agreements using flat
rates, as opposed to revenue thresholds. In order to include in a direct comparison the universities that
negotiate revenue sharing on a case-by-case basis or that use revenue thresholds to structure their
revenue sharing agreements, assumptions would have to be made about how university researchers
perceive these policies. Since there is no strong empirical or theoretical basis for these assumptions,
the cross comparisons in this study focus on the eleven universities that specify their revenue sharing
agreements using flat rates.
As demonstrated in Figure 4, there does not appear to be a relationship between the researcher’s
share of revenues from university-commercialized inventions and university counts of U.S. patents,
even when research intensity is taken into account. There is no evidence of a relationship when the
three Comprehensive universities are omitted, as shown in Figure 5.
This result suggests that there may not be a relationship between the two variables or that the
relationship is masked by the effect of another variable. As noted earlier, the right of first offer
appears to covary with the researcher’s share of revenues; the institutions that offered less financial
incentives than the norm are all universities that reserve the right of first offer. Therefore, the joint
effects of these two variables are explored in the next section.

4.2.5 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the University Commercializes the
Invention and Right of First Offer
Since only eleven universities specified the researcher’s share of net income for universitycommercialized-inventions, the relevant data were assembled in tabular form and visually inspected.
The three Comprehensive universities, described by Table 9, are too small a set to demonstrate a
relationship. Table 10 contains the information for the eight Medical-Doctoral universities. Among
these universities, the two highest patent counts are held by a university that reserves the right to first
refusal and an “inventor-owner” university, both of which offer their researchers a share of the
research revenues that is close to the norm. From this inspection, it is clear that the data do not
contain patterns of sufficient strength that statistically significant results are achievable. Therefore, no
further analysis of these variables was conducted.
In summary, the data do not provide any evidence that the researcher’s share of revenues from
university-commercialized inventions or a university reserving the right of first offer have an effect
on the amount of technology transfer at a given institution.

4.2.6 Researcher’s Share of Revenues When the Inventor Commercializes the
Invention and Right of First Offer
The researcher’s share of revenues from inventor-commercialized inventions is expected to act as a
greater incentive if the inventor has the option to proceed with independent commercialization
compared to those institutions that reserve the right of first offer; if the university reserves a right of
first offer, the inventor must expect that any valuable inventions will be claimed by the university.
Therefore, the researcher’s share of the revenues from inventor-commercialized inventions was only
studied at universities that do not reserve a right of first offer.
At “inventor-owner” universities, incentives that encourage independent commercialization on the
part of inventors were expected to decrease the number of patents held by the university because
independently-commercialized inventions are less likely to include the institution as an assignee on
the patent. However, the few universities that specify the inventor’s share of inventor-commercialized
inventions do not demonstrate the expected relationship. As shown in Figure 6, the two universities
with policies that specify revenue sharing that is less than the norm hold an average number of patents
relative to their peers. This finding does not suggest any relationship between the researcher’s share
of the income derived from inventor-commercialized inventions and the level of technology transfer
activity at a given university.

4.3 Discussion
This study did not discover any evidence that there are relationships between the financial incentives
or the amount of autonomy provided to researchers by university IP policies and university-industry
technology transfer outcomes. This section will explore the following three possible causes of this
failure to demonstrate a relationship.
Possibility 1. University IP policies have no significant effect upon technology transfer activity at a
university.
Possibility 2. University IP policies have significant effects upon technology transfer activity at a
university but the effects are obscured by the inadequacies of the data used in this study.
Possibility 3. University IP policies have significant effects upon technology transfer activity at a
university but the effects are obscured by the effects of other variables that also vary across the set of
institutions.
4.3.1 Possibility 1.
It is possible that the incentives offered to faculty inventors by university IP policies have no
significant effect on technology transfer outcomes. There is some evidence that this may be the case

<-----Page 73----->60
at least with respect to right to first offer. Clayman investigated the AUTM data for two groups of
16 research-intensive, Canadian universities, one with eight “inventor-owner” universities and
another with eight “university-owner” universities (2004). He expressed each outcome as a ratio
relative to millions of dollars of research expenditures, to account for differences in research intensity
across universities, and calculated averages for each group (2004). The data, summarized in Table
11, do not demonstrate any relationships. Unfortunately, Clayman’s work also suffers from the same
problem as the study described in this chapter; the AUTM data used in the research do not include
technology transfer activities undertaken by inventors without the support of the TTO. Therefore,
Clayman’s work is also subject to same limitations discussed in the next section and neither of these
studies are strong enough, either theoretically or in terms of the data used in the assessment, to rule
out the possibility that these incentives do have an impact. The only conclusion that can be made is
that there is no evidence that allowing inventors to commercialize their inventions results in a
decrease in the amount of technology transfer achieved by the TTO at the university.

4.3.2 Possibility 2.
If there is a significant relationship between the incentives provided by university IP policies and the
amount of technology transfer at a given university, it could have been obscured by problems with the
data used in assessing the relationship.
The most significant problem with the data used in the study is that the measure of the technology
transfer outcomes is likely to be biased towards “university-owner” universities and that this bias
could have obscured relationships of interest. The counts of the U.S. patents held by the universities
do not include any patents developed by university faculty members independently of the university.
Since there are likely to be more commercialization activities undertaken independently of the
university at “inventor-owner” universities, the use of this measure may obscure the relationship
between the amount of autonomy offered to researchers by the university IP policy and patenting
activities at universities. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that, even excluding all
independently developed patents, there is no evidence that universities that allow their researcher’s
control of technology transfer produce fewer patents. This suggests that either there is either no
difference between institutions that reserve right of first offer and those that do not, or that the
institutions that do not reserve right of first offer have more technology transfer activity than those
that do not.

<-----Page 74----->61
The bias in the technology transfer outcome measure is also important when interpreting the lack
of evidence of a relationship between the financial incentives offered by the university IP policies and
the number of patents held by the universities. As discussed in section 4.1.2, universities that do not
reserve the right of first offer have a wider range of revenue sharing arrangements than the
universities that do reserve the right of first offer and they are more likely to hold policies that set the
sharing lower than the norm value of 50%. Therefore, the revenue sharing agreements are correlated
with whether or not the university reserves a right of first offer. This means that the bias towards
“university-owner” universities may also obscure relationships between the revenue sharing
arrangements and technology transfer outcomes.
The only remedy for these problems would be the use of a measure that accounts for all technology
transfer activity at both “university-owner” and “inventor-owner” universities, regardless of whether
the active party is the university or the inventor. No such measure has been identified among the
measures tracked by the universities or collected in the AUTM or Statistics Canada annual surveys.
Designers of further cross-sectional studies would be advised to investigate the feasibility of
surveying university researchers to obtain a less biased measure.
While the bias in the technology transfer outcome variable is the most significant limitation related
to the choice of data, other aspects of the data also pose challenges. The data set was small from a
statistical perspective because of the small number of universities in Canada and because policies
could not be located for every university. It is possible that a relationship could be discovered if it was
possible to obtain policies and data for every university. Another problem with the data is that, as
with most technology transfer outcome variables, the distribution of the number of U.S. patents held
by Canadian universities is quite positively skewed. This requires either that the data are transformed
using a log transformation, for example, or that non-parametric tests are used instead of parametric
tests. Both of these approaches reduce the likelihood that a relationship will be identified. In the
assessment of the importance of financial incentives, this problem is compounded by the very small
number of institutions that are comparable because they specify their revenue sharing using a flat rate
and by the lack of diversity in the rates specified by these institutions. Together, these characteristics
of the data could obscure any relationships between policy variables and technology transfer variables
even if an unbiased technology transfer outcome variable could be collected. To address these
concerns, future studies need to use an unbiased measure of technology transfer activity, and to
increase the sample size, perhaps by moving to another unit of analysis. Future studies may also
benefit from an assessment of the changing importance of individual patents. As TTOs acquire more
resources they may begin to practice more aggressive patenting strategies, including protecting a
single technology with a cluster of patents, which would skew analyses towards highly patentable
technologies despite the fact that less patentable technologies can also have social and economic
value.
4.3.3 Possibility 3.
If there is a significant relationship between the incentives provided by university IP policies and the
amount of technology transfer at a given university, it could have been obscured by the effects of
other variables that also vary across the set of institutions. These other variables could obscure the

<-----Page 75----->62
true relationships between the IP policies and technology transfer outcomes in one of two ways: 1)
by having a direct impact on the amount of technology transfer at that institution; or 2) by having an
impact on the relationships themselves. For example, the amount of money available to do patenting
and licensing at a given university could have an effect on the number of patents that are based on
research at that university. This would be an example of a direct effect on the outcome variable. If the
amount of money available for patenting and licensing is a function of the revenue sharing agreement
between the university and its faculty inventors, then this variable could also have an impact on the
relationship between university IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.
It is important that these other factors are identified and their effects are determined. This will
permit a better assessment of the impact of policy variables. Even more importantly, the role of these
other variables will determine whether or not there is an optimal policy for all Canadian universities.
If institutional variables like research intensity or culture are found to influence the relationship
between university IP policies and technology transfer, the policy that best supports technology
transfer at one institution may be sub-optimal and potentially destructive at another. Therefore, it is
imperative that university IP policies are studied in a broader context.

4.4 Conclusions
In spite of the many reasons why university intellectual property policies can be presumed to have an
impact upon university-industry technology transfer, comparisons across institutions have not
demonstrated any relationships. It is possible that the true effects of IP policies are obscured by the
effects of other variables that also vary across the set of institutions or by differences in ways in
which technology transfer measures are gathered and reported. However, this study has demonstrated
that further cross-sectional studies are unlikely to produce significant results without access to a
significantly broader and more reliable data set. Further investigation of these possibilities is expected
to have important implications for policy. Therefore, two additional studies have been conducted that
are longitudinal and qualitative in nature.

Study 2: Quantitative Analysis of Impact of an IP Policy Change
This chapter contains the results of the quantitative analysis of the impact of the University of
Toronto IP policy change on annual counts of invention disclosures. The primary purpose of this
study was to assess whether or not the University of Toronto IP policy change had a statistically
significant effect on annual invention disclosures, a measure of researcher support of universityindustry technology transfer.
This chapter is organized into four sections. The first section provides a brief description of the
University of Toronto in order to familiarize the reader with the organizational context of the study.
The second section describes the exploratory data analysis, in which plots of the data were visually
inspected to identify properties of the data that are of interest and suggest variables for inclusion in
the models. The third section presents the results of the confirmatory data analysis in which the
impact of the policy intervention was assessed by comparing models of the impact, principally using
regression analysis. The second and third sections are further supported by Appendix C, in which the
statistical tests are discussed in more detail. The final section in the chapter includes a discussion of
the limitations of the study and the implications of the results.

5.1 Background on the University of Toronto
The University of Toronto is one of Canada’s largest and most research-intensive universities. It
offers a wide range of degree programs from the undergraduate through to the graduate level,
including 75 doctoral programs (University of Toronto, 2005). Professional degrees are offered
through the university’s 14 professional faculties (University of Toronto, 2005). In 2005, student
enrollment was approximately 70,000, of which approximately 60,000 were full-time students
(University of Toronto, 2005). It is affiliated with a number of hospital research institutes in the
Toronto region; faculty members are often cross-appointed and the university and research institutes
conduct joint research projects (University of Toronto, 2000). According to the AUCC database of
the data created for the 2003 Maclean’s survey, the University of Toronto had about 560 faculty
members who were eligible for research funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research
Council (NSERC), and about 630 faculty who were eligible for research funding from the Canadian
Institutes for Health Research (CIHR). In the past five years, the University of Toronto has
consistently reported receiving the most research money per faculty member of any Canadian
university (RE$EARCH Infosource, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005). Since the University of Toronto
has a large and active faculty cohort in technological areas, the university is expected to conduct a
great deal of research that could potentially generate commercializable technologies. Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that the university is capable of supporting a relatively high level of technology
transfer activity.

<-----Page 77----->64
5.1.1 Intellectual Property Policies at the University of Toronto
On January 1st of 1990, a new hybrid IP policy came into effect at the University of Toronto (1990).
Prior to this date, no significant changes had been made to the incentives provided to researchers
since at least 1977.
Prior to the policy change, the University of Toronto had held a policy wherein the university
owned the IP created in the course of university research. Invention disclosures were made to an
Inventions Committee at the university. If the Inventions Committee determined that the invention
had some value, the committee would direct the inventors to assign the invention to the university and
the university would assign the invention to the University of Toronto Innovations Foundation, an
organization founded to commercialize technologies developed at the University of Toronto. A
technology manager who worked at the University of Toronto during this period reported that, in
practice, all invention disclosures were accepted by the committee and hence assigned to the
Innovations Foundation. There was an increasing number of invention disclosures per year over the
early 1980s and this increasing workload was not matched by an increase in resources at the
Innovations Foundation. By the late 1980s, faculty members were complaining that the Innovations
Foundation was ineffective and unresponsive and invention disclosures were in decline. An
investigation by technology managers revealed that faculty wanted to have ownership of their
inventions. This may have been, in part, because they did not trust the Innovations Foundation with
the commercialization of their inventions.
A new policy was devised that allowed researchers to develop their inventions independently of the
university. If the inventors choose to ask for assistance, the Innovations Foundation will assess the
invention and decide whether or not to commit internal resources to the development of the invention.
If the Innovations Foundation chooses to develop the invention, it will pay for the acquisition of the
appropriate legal protections, the marketing of the technology, and the legal costs of creating and
maintaining licences with receptor firms. In these cases, the university researcher will receive 25% of
the net revenue. If the Innovations Foundation chooses not to develop the technology, the ownership
of the technology rests with the inventor, who can then seek other avenues for commercialization. If
the university researcher chooses to develop the invention independently, the researcher is responsible
for protecting and commercializing the innovation and providing 25% of the net revenue from these
commercialization activities to the university.
This policy shift significantly reorganized the rights and responsibilities of faculty inventors and
the university and it is likely that the most significant change is the difference in the amount of
autonomy provided to the researchers. The new policy provided university researchers with greater
autonomy; they could choose to approach the university or they could choose to develop their
inventions as they saw fit without the intervention of the university TTO or the Innovations
Foundation. This change did have some effect on the financial incentives offered to researchers. If
they developed their technologies independently they could retain a higher share of the net income
than if they allowed the university to develop the technology. However, relative to other Canadian
universities, the researcher’s share of the financial returns remained below the norm in both the case
where the university develops the technology and the case where the inventor develops the

<-----Page 78----->65
technology. Therefore it is likely that the most significant aspect of the policy change was the
change in the amount of autonomy provided to researchers.
The time series of annual counts of invention disclosures provided by the University of Toronto
TTO and used to assess the impact of the policy shift is especially interesting for two reasons. Firstly,
the University of Toronto is the only institution that has been identified that permits inventors to
commercialize technologies independently of the university and that collects reasonably reliable
institution-wide data that include the activities pursued independently. Often institutions fail to track
activities pursued independently of the university’s TTO and this bias in the data can corrupt
comparisons of universities with different policy structures by systematically underestimating the
level of activity within “inventor-owner” universities (Hoye & Roe, 2003). Furthermore, the
University of Toronto started tracking technology transfer measures well before the policy shift. This
makes it possible to compare the institution’s activities prior to the shift to those after the shift.
In order to assess the impact, if any, that this policy shift had on the university’s technology
transfer activities, a time series of the changing counts of invention disclosures was investigated.
Under both the old and new policies, faculty members are required to submit an invention disclosure
to the university at the start of the commercialization process. Unlike patents, licences, and spin-offs,
invention disclosures are created shortly after the faculty members decide to commercialize a
technology and do not rely heavily on the availability of commercialization resources, such as
investment capital, funds for prototype development and intellectual property protection, and business
expertise. As a result, the number of invention disclosures reported at a university is more closely
linked to researcher support for technology transfer than the other outcome variables that are
currently tracked, such as licence revenue and returns from the realization of spin-off equity.
Therefore, the assessment of the effects of this policy shift has been based on an investigation of the
trends in the numbers of invention disclosures submitted in the thirty-year period centered on the
policy change.

5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
Visual inspection of a time series, as introduced by Tukey (1970), is an effective way to pursue the
“numerical detective work required to explore important properties of the data” and to determine the
subset of models most likely to model the time series adequately (Hipel & McLeod, 1994, p.177).
Three types of plots were used to investigate the time series of University of Toronto invention
disclosures: graphs of the raw and smoothed data against time, and box-and-whisker plots.
The raw time series, shown in Figure 7, was inspected for evidence that the policy change of
1990/1991 affected the number of invention disclosures. This plot shows a significant increase in the
number of invention disclosures reported annually between fiscal years 1991/1992 and 1992/1993.
Furthermore, annual counts of invention disclosures appear to be relatively constant from year to year
prior to that point, and steeply increasing from year to year after that point. These findings suggest
that there is a break point between fiscal years 1991/1992 and 1992/1993.
Smoothing functions make underlying trends in the data more apparent (Hipel & McLeod, 1994).
Therefore, in order to investigate the possibility of a breakpoint in 1992 further, the data were split

<-----Page 79----->66
into two time series, one before and one after the breakpoint, and smoothed using two different
functions. The results of smoothing with a three-year centered moving average are shown in Figure 8.
The results of smoothing with the 4253H function are shown in Figure 9. This latter function involves
calculating running medians of 4, then 2, then 5, then 3, then applying a Hanning smooth in which a
running weighted average is calculated using weights (¼, ½, ¼), and it is a standard smooth in the
assessment of time series (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). These plots were also inspected for evidence that
the policy change of 1990/1991 affected the number of invention disclosures. The smoothed plots
confirmed the findings of the scatter plot of the raw data, in that both smoothed series demonstrated
an abrupt increase in 1992 and a higher rate of increase from year to year after 1992.

Figure 10: Box-and-whisker Plots of Invention Disclosures
Box-and-whisker plots are also helpful in identifying structural changes to distributions caused by an
intervention because box-and-whisker diagrams summarize five values describing population
distributions. A box-and-whisker plot was created in order to compare the time series to two of its
subsets: one including only fiscal years up to and including 1990/1991; and the other including only
fiscal years after 1990/1991. In this box-and-whisker plot, the top and bottom of the rectangle
correspond to the 0.75 and 0.25 quartiles respectively, the dark band across the rectangle identifies
the median, and the lines attached to the rectangle stretch to touch to the maximum and minimum
values. The substantial difference in the medians, 0.25 quartiles, and 0.75 quartiles for the two
subpopulations, shown by Figure 10, reaffirm the existence of a breakpoint in 1992.
Visual inspection can also be used to assess data for violations of the assumptions of the analytical
method (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). In this case, the box-and-whisker plot was used to assess whether
or not the time series of invention disclosures violated the assumptions underlying regression
methods by demonstrating heteroscedascity or non-normality.
Residuals are said to be heteroscedasctic or to demonstrate heteroscedascity when the variance of
the residuals is a function of one of the independent variables (Keith, 2006). When heteroscedascity
exists, tests of significance are no longer valid because the standard errors tend to be understated,
which can give a spurious impression of accuracy (Chatterjee et al., 2000). Box-and-whisker plots, in
which the data are grouped by the different levels of the independent variables, are an effective
strategy for identifying heteroscedascity. In this case, the most helpful grouping is that shown in
Figure 10. The large difference between the heights of the two box-and-whisker plots of the
subpopulations demonstrate that the two groups have different variances and suggests that
heteroscedascity might be a problem. To investigate further, the variances of the two subpopulations

<-----Page 82----->69
were calculated. The earlier data set was found to have a variance of 70.1 and the later data set was
found to have a variance 637.5. Therefore, the ratio of variance between the high and low variance
sets is less than 10:1. Under these circumstances heteroscedascity is not a concern; transformations
of the data are not required and the regression modeling can proceed (Keith, 2006).
Regression analysis also requires that the data have a normal distribution. Box-and-whisker plots
are helpful for diagnosing non-normal distributions because normal populations map to symmetrical
box-and-whisker plots. All three of the box-and-whisker plots in Figure 10 are sufficiently
asymmetrical to warrant further exploration. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality
of the three populations because it is more sensitive than the more common Kolmogorov-Smirnov
with Lillefors correction and the population size is very small. The overall time series was found to
have a non-normal distribution (W=0.85, p=.001). There was no evidence that the data series
representing the years prior to the policy intervention and after the policy intervention had nonnormal distributions (W=0.95, p=.477; W=.94, p=.430 respectively). This suggests that the nonnormality of the overall population is a consequence of the underlying trends in the data rather than a
non-normal noise component. Therefore, regression analysis can proceed without a transformation of
the data but the residuals generated by fitting the model need to be assessed for normality. Violations
of this assumption will indicate that the model fit is inadequate.
In summary, the exploratory data analysis suggested that regression analysis is feasible and that the
models should include effects on both the average number of annual disclosures and on the increase
in these disclosures from year to year.

5.3 Confirmatory Data Analysis
The statistical analysis of the impact of an intervention upon a time series can be approached using
regression methods, ARIMA methods, and non-parametric tests (Hipel & McLeod, 1994). ARIMA
methods are often the first choice when modeling time series data because they provide a mechanism
for mitigating the impact of autocorrelation. Autocorrelation exists when the differences between the
modeled values and the actual values associated with successive observations are correlated; it can
cause the standard errors to be understated and thus undermine tests of significance (Chatterjee et al.,
2000). However, use of an ARIMA model typically requires at least 50 observations and the time
series of interest contains only 29 observations (Montgomery & Johnson, 1976). The feasibility of
ARIMA methods was tested using SPSS DecisionTime, which indicated that it was not possible to
create a significant intervention models using ARIMA methods of analysis. Non-parametric tests are
less able to provide nuanced descriptive information and less sensitive than parametric (i.e.
regression) methods and thus less likely to detect significant results. Therefore, the analysis was
based on the application of regression methods and steps were taken to ensure that the results were
not corrupted by the presence of autocorrelation.
5.3.1 Modeling the Impact of the Policy Intervention
Visual inspection suggested that the policy intervention resulted in an abrupt increase in both the
annual count of invention disclosures and the year-to-year increase in the number of invention

<-----Page 83----->70
disclosures after the intervention. To test the statistical significance of these patterns in the data,
four different models of the impact were generated using forced-entry regression and compared to a
baseline model that did not allow for any changes over the predicted breakpoint. The five models are
summarized in Table 12.
Each of the five models was fitted to the data, then regression diagnostics were performed. The
regression residuals were inspected to ensure that they conformed to the following three assumptions:
1. The residuals should have a normal distribution. Often a non-normal distribution is a
consequence of other violations.
2. The residuals should be homeoscedastic, which means that they display equal variance across
the different levels of the explanatory variables. When this condition is not met the residuals
are said to be heteroscedastic and the significance of the model and parameters can be
spuriously inflated.
3. The residuals should be independent of one another. When residuals display trends or
relationships between one residual and the next, the data are said to display autocorrelation.
This type of violation also results in spurious inflation of the tests of significance.

Violations of these three assumptions, especially the third assumption, are important for two
reasons. First, these violations suggest that the model does not fit the data adequately. Therefore, the
decreasing number of violations displayed by the successive models in Table 13 indicate that the
model that assumed that the policy intervention had some effect on the invention disclosure counts fit
the data better than the baseline model, which assumed that the policy intervention had no effect. This
is evidence that the policy intervention had an effect on the invention disclosures. Second, when the
assumptions are not met, the tests of significance are not directly interpretable. Therefore, only
Models 4 and 5 can be directly assessed for fit using the tests of significance.

In order to assess all four of the models of the impact of the policy intervention (Models 2-5), each
one was compared to Model 1, which assumed the policy intervention had no impact, using an F-test
(for details please see Appendix D in the Model 2 section). This test was appropriate in this context
for three reasons. First, the test results will not be corrupted by the violations noted in Table 13.
While the F-test is based on the sum of the squared errors (SSE) of the models, the violations are
most extreme in the case of the baseline model and thus it will have the most spuriously understated
errors. This will result in a more conservative test than a situation in which none of the models
demonstrate violations like autoregression. Second, the F-test takes into account the number of
parameters in each model when assessing the relative goodness of fit. This means that Models 2
through 5 can be compared against the less complex Model 1. Third, if a model that allows for the
policy intervention to have an impact is shown to fit the data significantly better than Model 1, it will
be statistical evidence that the policy intervention had an impact. As the test results summarized in
Table 14 show, Models 2, 3, 4, and 5 were all found to provide a significantly better fit at the .05
level than Model 1. Therefore, there is evidence that the policy intervention had an impact.

A closer comparison of the models allows a more nuanced description of the impact of the policy
intervention. As discussed earlier, only Models 4 and 5 were free of violations of the assumptions
underlying regression analysis, and thus have directly interpretable tests of significance. The tests of
significance, summarized in Table 15, show that all the parameters of Model 5 were significant at the
.05 level and that one of Model 4’s parameters was not. Therefore, the tests of significance indicate
that Model 5 fits the data best. This indicates that prior to the policy change there was no significant
change in the number of invention disclosures from year to year but that there was a significant
change from year to year after the policy intervention. Furthermore, the intervention caused an
immediate increase in the number of invention disclosures.
In summary, the interrupted time series analysis of the University of Toronto invention disclosures
provides strong evidence that the policy intervention had significant and substantial effects on the
annual counts of invention disclosures.

5.3.2 Assessing the Practical Significance of the Policy Intervention
The changes in slope and level are both significant but need to be evaluated to determine whether
they are of practical significance. The Model 5 parameter estimates indicate that prior to the policy
intervention there were 22.2 ± 4.7 inventions disclosed per year. Immediately after the intervention,
the number of disclosures increased by 49.0 ± 12.2. There is no question that this immediate increase
is substantial when compared to the pre-intervention disclosure rates. Furthermore, the number of
invention disclosures continued increasing from year to year by 5.9 ± 1.4 disclosures per year. In the
thirteen documented years since the policy intervention this increase from year to year has accounted
for an increase of approximately another 77 invention disclosures per year. In summary, the bestfitting model has been shown to be the one in which both the slope and the level changed at the break
point, and the magnitudes of these changes were of practical significance. This is strong evidence that
the policy intervention had a significant and substantial impact on the annual counts of invention
disclosures.
To investigate the practical significance of the effects of the policy intervention further, the
University of Toronto’s invention disclosures were compared to those of other comparable
universities. All of the available AUTM Surveys were collected, resulting in a dataset spanning fiscal
years 1992 to 2003. Of the G10, a group of research intensive Canadian institutions, only the
University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia, McMaster University, Queen's University,
the Université de Montreal, and the University of Western Ontario submitted their invention
disclosure counts for five or more of the eleven years that the survey has been collected. These six
universities were used to establish a frame of reference for the invention disclosures reported by the
University of Toronto. As shown in Table 16, the mean number of invention disclosures per
institution ranges between 20 and 108 disclosures a year. This is strong evidence that the abrupt
increase of 29 disclosures that the University of Toronto experienced over the break point is quite
substantial. The data also show that, between 1992 and 2003, the University of Toronto is among the
top three universities in the group of reporting institutions in terms of having the highest sustained
levels of invention disclosures. This continues to be true even when the different sizes of the
institutions are taken into account by calculating the ratio of the mean number of annual invention
disclosures to 2003 estimations of the number of researchers eligible for research grants in the natural
sciences and engineering (NSERC) and medicine and health (CIHR). These comparisons to other
members of the G10 suggest that the University of Toronto has one of the best records in Canada in
terms of having inventions disclosed to the university.

It is also possible to compare the trend over time for this group of comparable universities to the trend
over time for the University of Toronto. Between 1992 and 2003, the mean number of invention
disclosures for the group rose by 2.20 disclosures a year. Over the same time period, the invention
disclosures counts for the University of Toronto rose by 4.72 disclosures a year. This result is strong
evidence that the increase in invention disclosures per year associated with the policy intervention is a
substantial gain. It also confirms that post-intervention, the University of Toronto is quite competitive
with other research-intensive Canadian universities in terms of both level and increase in the number
of invention disclosures from year to year.
5.3.3 A Review of Other Outcomes
The chief drawback to the use of invention disclosures as an outcome variable is the absence of a
strong link between this early stage activity and the desired outcomes of university-industry
technology transfer activities. Policies that change the number of invention disclosures may also have
an impact on the quality of the disclosures. An increase in the number of non-viable inventions
disclosed is not a boon to the university, the regional or the national economy; it creates the risk that
scarce resources will be spent on either non-viable innovations or on screening the technologies and
thus detract from the possibility of successful transfer of the viable technologies. If that were the case
at the University of Toronto, we would expect to see its productivity figures, over time, significantly
lagging that of other research-intensive universities in Canada.

<-----Page 88----->75
There is no evidence that the increase in the number of invention disclosures was associated with
a decline in the quality of the disclosures. As shown in Table 6, the University of Toronto’s
technology transfer outcomes per U.S.$1M of research expenditures, are reasonably consistent with
the averages for Canadian universities, especially considering that the University of Toronto’s
measures do not include the outcomes generated by its research hospital affiliates, unlike most other
research-intensive universities in Canada. The University of Toronto exceeds the average number of
spin-off companies per U.S.$1M in the top ten most research-intensive universities and colleges in
both Canada and the United States. The only measure in which it appears to lag the two groups of
research intensive institutions substantially is ‘Licence Income Received’. This measure consistently
displays the most variability because it is highly negatively skewed by the inclusion of ‘big winners’
(Clayman, 2004). For example, the Canadian university that receives the most licence income, about
$10M per annum, receives ten times that of the second most ‘productive’ university, and the vast
majority of its licence revenue is derived from a single technology that is widely licensed (Clayman,
2004). Similarly, the U.S. means for this measure are skewed by the inclusion of technologies earning
between $30M and $70M per annum (Clayman, 2004). The resulting skewness of the data makes it
impossible to interpret even large differences in average licensing revenues. The available data
provide no evidence that the gains in the number of invention disclosures at the University of Toronto
are associated with a drop in quality of the research disclosures; it can not be ascertained whether the
lower Licence Income Received from the University of Toronto’s invention disclosures resulted from
lower quality inventions or whether the licensing revenues simply reflect the element of chance
involved in the distribution of these ‘big winners’. The productivity measures for the University of
Toronto are consistent with the measures for the ten most research-intensive Canadian universities for
all but the most variable of the cumulative performance measures for Canadian universities. Like
other research-intensive Canadian institutions, the University of Toronto receives less licence income
per dollar of research expenditure than the U.S. top twenty universities but has more spin-offs than
the U.S. top twenty universities.

5.4 Conclusions
5.4.1 Limitations of the Study
The main limitation of this study is that it is based on only one policy shift at one university. It is
possible that the observed relationship may be spurious. Ideally, different policy shifts at different
universities would have been studied to strengthen the generalizability of the results but no data were
available. The study of multiple institutions would have provided the opportunity to investigate the
role that institutional or environmental variables play in determining the impact of a policy
intervention.
The study of other institutions would also have permitted the isolation of the effects of the changes
to the invention disclosure form at the University of Toronto. It is possible that the streamlining of the
form that reduced it from about eight pages to two pages, shortly after the policy change, increased
the number of invention disclosures. However, the interest that faculty members expressed in owning
their inventions is inconsistent with the changes to form having a substantial, long-term impact; it is
difficult to imagine an inventor who is seriously interested in independently commercializing a
technology and who would be derailed by an eight page form.
Another limitation pertains to the AUTM data used in the broader assessment of the University of
Toronto’s technology transfer outcomes. This data set is widely used because it is one of the few
instruments that reports institution-specific data. However, the AUTM members do not always track
and report data using the same definitions for ‘invention disclosures’, ‘spin-offs’, and so on.
Therefore, researchers should be cautioned that cross-institution comparisons require careful scrutiny.
5.4.2 Implications
This study provides the first empirical evidence that a change from “university-owns” to “inventorowns” intellectual property policies can have a significant and substantial impact on university
researcher’s willingness to engage in technology transfer. The findings of this study suggest that the
policy intervention at the University of Toronto had a significant and desirable impact on the level of
technology transfer activity at that institution.
The immediacy of the observed effect has implications for the type of relationship between the
policy change and the outcomes of interest. The paper by Siegel, Waldman, Atwater and Link (2004)
that was discussed in section 2.2.3.2.2, included a quote that suggested IP policies may have an effect
on hiring and retention of faculty who support technology transfer and that this effect may account for
inter-institutional differences in technology transfer activities. In other words, some policies are more
attractive to faculty that are involved in technology transfer and this influences their decisions to
remain with a given university and to which universities they will consider moving. The immediacy
of the effect observed in this chapter, suggests that this relationship did not account for the effect.
This suggests that a significant proportion of the effect was a result of an increased propensity of
faculty members already present in the university to participate in technology transfer activities.

<-----Page 90----->77
On first inspection the findings of this study appear to contradict Study 1, the study that was
discussed in Chapter 4. That cross-sectional study failed to find any relationship between the
incentives offered by university policies and technology transfer outcomes reported by universities.
However, these studies are consistent if other institutional differences influence the relationship
between IP policies and university-industry technology transfer. This would mean that the individual
character of each institution best fits a different policy and that achieving this fit can create important
benefits. If this is the case, it is possible that the University of Toronto can realize benefits from a
change to a policy, without requiring that that policy also be highly effective at other institutions. In
other words, the optimal policy may depend on local or institutional variables.
The time series analysis can not predict which local or institutional factors had a role in the success
of the University of Toronto policy change. However, the description of the policy change by a
technology manager who worked at the University of Toronto during the time of the policy change,
suggests three intertwined factors. Firstly, the technology manager reported that faculty members saw
ownership of the IP as a desirable incentive, which suggests that the university culture was relatively
supportive of technology transfer activities. Secondly, many faculty members complained that the
University of Toronto Innovations Foundation was ineffective and uncommunicative, which suggests
that by the time of the policy shift there was widespread distrust of the competence of the
organization designated to commercialize their inventions. This last aspect of the situations appears to
have been a consequence of the third factor, a persistent gap between the workload of the Innovations
Foundation and its resources. Considered together these factors suggest that the ideal IP policy for a
university needs to be designed in response to the institution’s resources, culture, and the perceptions
of key actors, including faculty members, and that these perceptions may be influenced by the
university’s history in terms of technology transfer activities.
If this is the case, national convergence to a single policy is likely to damage researcher support for
technology transfer at some universities. This suggests that widespread policy changes should only be
adopted in the face of a persuasive, empirical evidence of other benefits from such a move. In the
absence of strong, empirical evidence of other benefits, individual universities should be encouraged
to entertain policy innovations that best fit their strengths and needs.
More research is necessary to determine which factors are most likely to influence the relationship
between university IP policies and university-industry technology transfer. Since individual
perceptions appear to matter and there is not yet a strong theoretical base describing the relevant
dimensions, the most effective research strategy will be qualitative, interview-based research because
this kind of inductive research is capable of providing theoretical direction in emerging research
areas. Therefore, an in-depth interview study of faculty members, who have been involved in
technology transfer activities, was conducted at the University of Waterloo, and is described in
Chapter 6.
5.4.3 Summary
This study provides statistical evidence that university IP policies can be a significant factor in
determining the effectiveness of institutions by influencing university researcher’s willingness to
participate in technology transfer activities. Increasing researcher control of technology transfer by

<-----Page 91----->78
switching from a ‘university-owns’ to a ‘inventor-owns’ system appears to have stimulated higher
levels of invention disclosures. More research is needed to determine the generalizability of this
conclusion and to isolate any other factors that determine the impact of a policy change.

Study 3: Qualitative Investigation of Faculty Inventors’ Experiences
This chapter presents the results of the qualitative investigation into faculty inventor’s experiences
with technology transfer. This study seeks to discover how university researchers’ understand their
technology transfer experiences, and to share this perspective in the researcher’s own words as much
as possible. The thematic analysis of the open-ended interviews is expected to provide insight into the
individuals and the environment that first supported technology transfer activities at the University of
Waterloo, where the activities include the creation of some of the university’s high-profile spin-off
companies. The goal of this study is the identification of theories that can be used to explain aspects
of the relationship between IP policies and technology transfer outcomes.
The chapter is organized into four sections. The first and second sections provide context for the
study. The first section provides a brief description of the University of Waterloo in order to
familiarize the reader with the organizational context of the study. The second section briefly
describes the technology transfer, research and teaching activities of the participants. The third
section provides the results of the analysis conducted according to the methodology described in 3.4.
The final section in the chapter includes a discussion of the limitations of the study and the
implications of the results.

6.1 Background on the University of Waterloo
This brief description of the university is provided so that scholars unfamiliar with the university will
have a context for the study. The University of Waterloo dates its history from the first classes held
within the institution, in July of 1957 (Redmond, 2006). As a result, some of the senior and retired
faculty and staff remember the founding of the university and the early period in which the university
expanded very quickly. The University of Waterloo is now classified by the Maclean’s magazine as a
‘Comprehensive’ university. The primary differences between Comprehensive universities and the
larger ‘Medical-Doctoral’ universities, like the University of Toronto, are that Comprehensive
universities offer fewer doctoral programs and do not have medical programs. Thus, they do not have
and are not closely affiliated with hospital research centers. Like many ‘Comprehensive’ universities,
UW is medium-sized in the context of Canadian institutions. In 2004, student enrollment was 23,000,
of which 2,500 were part-time students. According to the AUCC database of the data created for the
2003 Maclean’s survey, the University of Waterloo had about 480 faculty members who were eligible
for research funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), and
about 40 faculty who were eligible for research funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health
Research (CIHR). In other words, UW has almost any many faculty members who are eligible for
NSERC grants as the much larger University of Toronto. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
the university is capable of supporting a moderately high level of technology transfer activity, which
makes it a viable site in which to study technology transfer. However, the distribution of technologies
and receptor industries is expected to differ from ‘Medical-Doctoral’ institutions,

<-----Page 93----->80
6.1.1 Intellectual Property Policy and Technology Transfer Information
University of Waterloo technology transfer measures were explored with the goal of quantitatively
describing technology transfer activities at the University of Waterloo over the years in order to
provide a context for the qualitative analysis. This exploration led to the conclusion that IP policies
are a factor in the information flows associated with technology transfer. As described in earlier
sections, the University of Waterloo IP policy allows ownership to vest with the inventors; inventors
have no need to interact with the university Technology Transfer and Licensing Office (TTLO), with
one exception. The university requires that faculty inventors disclose their inventions to the TTLO.
This exception has little practical impact because, the University of Waterloo like many other
institutions, has not enforced the requirement and, as a result, it is has not been observed (Siegel,
Waldman et al., 2003). As a result, it is quite likely that the records maintained by the TTLO have
underreported technology transfer activity in the past. For example, a University of Waterloo
technology manager explained that he sometimes found out about University of Waterloo spin-off
companies by reading the local newspaper. He indicated that he did the best he could to provide valid
statistics to organizations like AUTM but that he wasn’t confident in the completeness or the
consistency from year to year of the data. This finding suggests that IP policies are a factor in the
information flows in a university concerned with technology transfer activities. This suggests that the
‘inventor-owner’ configuration may make it more difficult for the university to design and provide
appropriate supports for technology transfer activities.
This information gap also has a research implication. The data provided by the University of
Waterloo to organizations like AUTM is likely to be biased, in that it does not include activities
undertaken by the inventors without TTLO assistance, and unreliable, in that it may have been
collected and reported inconsistently from year to year. The following discussion of technology
transfer measures is limited to spin-off formation because it wasn’t possible to confirm the validity
and reliability of the measures related to licensing activities.
6.1.1.1 Spin-off Formation at the University of Waterloo
The University of Waterloo is well-known in Canada for having a relatively large number of spinoffs. This interest in university spin-offs prompted several reports (Cross & Babensee, 1992, 1994;
Pricewaterhouse Cooper, 2001). As a result, it is possible to verify the AUTM spin-off creation
counts from the 1980-1995 time period. Table 18 displays the University of Waterloo data from that
period as well as the data for the other Canadian universities which participated in the AUTM
surveys. Within this set of moderately to highly research-intensive universities, the University of
Waterloo reported the third largest number of spin-offs between 1980 and 1995, and had the third
highest ratio between the number of spin-offs and the number of full-time faculty members eligible
for research funding in medicine or the natural and applied sciences. The University of Waterloo
spin-offs are credited with a significant role in the development of a cluster of approximately 450
firms in the Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge-Guelph region, worth approximately six billion dollars a
year (Xu, 2003). Xu reports that the firms are export-oriented, with 95% of their sales to leading
technology markets including California and Japan, implying that they are internationally competitive
(2003). The spin-off activity is also likely to spur further academic involvement in technology

<-----Page 94----->81
transfer at the University of Waterloo. Bercovitz and Feldman (2004) report that professors who
observe either peers or academic leaders engaged in technology transfer are much more likely to
engage in technology transfer themselves. Most of the participants in this study started participating
in technology transfer activities before the University of Waterloo had developed a reputation for
spinning-off companies. The interviews with the participants provide access to the environment that
produced the high-profile spin-offs and contributed to both the local high-technology cluster and a
continued entrepreneurial culture at the University of Waterloo.

6.2 Background on the Participants and their Activities
The participants are senior or retired faculty members from the pure and applied science and
mathematics departments at the university. Each participant had experience with technology transfer
activities or had conducted contract work and extensive research in industry. Most of the participants
had been involved with spin-off firms. Many of the participants had been involved in multiple
technology transfers. Half of the participants who had licensed technologies or had been involved in
the formation of spin-off companies had been involved with the commercialization of multiple
technologies. As a result, the group of ten participants was responsible for the transfer from
university to receptor organizations of twelve distinct sets of technologies. This evidence of the
existence of a class of serial commercializers is not unique to this study. Pries found that many of the
participants in his survey of faculty members involved in technology transfer at four universities in
South-Western Ontario had been involved with multiple transfers (Pries, 2006). Shane and Khurana
(2003) found that, for faculty members at M.I.T., each patent already commercialized by a spin-off
increased the probability that they would have another technology commercialized by a spin-off, to a
statistically significant extent.
The participants’ involvement in university-industry interactions were characterized by a wide
range of activities usually beginning many years before formal attempts to transfer technology
through licences or spin-off. These university-industry interactions included: 1) offering seminars,
courses and workshops to industry at both on-campus and at firm sites; 2) conducting contract
research for industry; 3) consulting with industry; 4) participating in trade conferences and expos
attended by industry and/or the users of the technology; 5) doing sabbaticals in industry; 6) leaving
the university to work in industry for a time; 7) participating in committees and professional groups
that also include industry; 8) maintaining informal communications with contacts developed through
these means; and, 9) maintaining contacts with students and colleagues who have moved into
industry. Rahm (1994) has described researchers exhibiting these behaviour patterns as ‘boundaryspanning’ researchers. She has demonstrated that ‘boundary-spanning’ researchers differ from
‘university-bound’ researchers in a number of ways; for example, they are more likely to engage in a
wide range of interactions with industry (1994). Therefore, Rahm’s findings will be used to analyze
the results of the thematic analysis.
The outcomes associated with the set of technology transfers are substantial. The transfers
succeeded in making available to the market ten of the technologies and therefore succeeded in
improving the quality of life by making improved products and services available to individuals in
Canada and abroad. With the formation of new ventures, jobs have been created in the Waterloo
region, which is evidence that the transfers have contributed to regional economic development.
Several of the spin-offs are international leaders in their fields and hence competitive in international
markets. This suggests that these firms are contributing to Canada’s international competitiveness
and, hence, to the health of the national economy.
Many of the spin-off companies were formed using the private capital of the faculty members and
staff members who had been involved in developing the technology. Only a few technologies were
developed with the assistance of the University of Waterloo Technology Transfer and Licensing
Office or a similar support organization. As a result, the university was not granted royalties or equity

<-----Page 96----->83
shares in every case. However, the university derived other benefits from the technology transfers
studied through these interviews, including sponsoring of research on campus, donations, and the
increased number of local high-technology companies who act as employers for graduates and cooperative education students. Media coverage of the success of the high-profile spin-offs also appears
to have contributed to the university’s reputation (e.g. Keenan et al., 2006).
An effort was made to include transfers that differed in the extent to which they were successful.
As a consequence, the financial results for the set of transfers vary. So far, three transfers have
generated no returns, four transfers have resulted in returns comparable to less risky investments (i.e.
investments in the stock or bond markets), four transfers have resulted in substantially bigger returns,
and the last transfer is still in a developmental phase.
Apart from their involvement in technology transfer activities, contract work and research in
industry, there is evidence that the participants were highly productive in both the research and
teaching domains. The ten participants had generated approximately 5 peer-reviewed publications per
year, on average, over their careers to date. As a group they had generated a total of 34 books and 93
patents. Many of the participants had received prestigious research awards, some had been granted
teaching awards, and two talked of receiving consistently high teaching evaluations and
commendations from their students.

6.3 Results of the Thematic Data Analysis
This section reviews the steps involved in the thematic data analysis, briefly describes the codes that
were developed to capture important aspects of the data, and then elaborates on the results by
providing a description of the data associated with each code.
6.3.1 The Thematic Data Analysis Process
The analysis of the interview data proceeded in two steps. First, profiles were developed for each of
the participants by repeatedly culling excerpts from the transcripts for a series of interviews with a
single participant. Content was most likely to be selected for inclusion in a profile if it was clear from
the wording and tone that the participant felt strongly about the subject, or if the participant brought
up the subject unprompted, or revisited the topic multiple times over the course of the interviews.
These profiles were broken up in vignettes, one to three paragraph excerpts. Second, through an
iterative thematic analysis process the vignettes were coded with descriptive labels suggested by the
data.
The coding was conducted using a software package developed to assist with this type of
qualitative research, QSR’s nVivo, version 6.0. By the end of the first few iterations, twenty codes
had emerged. Once all of the vignettes were associated with at least one of the codes, the codes and
relationships between the coded data were reviewed. Some of the original codes, like ‘UniversityIndustry interactions’ were associated with many excerpts that the resulting set of excerpts was
unwieldy. Other codes, including ‘Effects of co-op,’ were associated with only one or two excerpts.
A new hierarchical set of codes was created, in which all of the individual codes were organized
according to five over-arching themes: university-industry activities; 2) university environment; 3)

<-----Page 97----->84
rewards and reward systems; 4) attitudes; and, 5) career decisions. Each of these top-level themes
contains between two and six themes; there are 17 sub-themes, altogether. This hierarchical structure
facilitated the development of a more intelligible structure by permitting the subdivision of unwieldly
datasets using sub-themes, and the consolidation of less substantial sets of excerpts. During this
process, three of the codes associated with the smallest sets of themes were merged with other
themes. For example, the vignette associated with the ‘Effects of co-op’ was included with ‘Success
factors’ under ‘University-industry activities.’ The purpose of the coding was to reduce and organize
the large amount of data produced by the study; the constructs were created to communicate the
results and should not be used as a theoretical framework without further development using the
broader technology transfer literature. The coded vignettes are presented in Appendix F, with each
excerpt presented under the code to which it contributes the most. The following subsections describe
each of the themes, using the interview data in conjunction with information about the technology
transfers, in order to convey a rich depiction of the participants’ behaviours, environments, attitudes,
and experiences.
6.3.2 University-Industry Activities
This over-arching theme explores attributes of the technology transfer activities and other universityindustry interactions in which the participants were involved. It is further divided into six subthemes: 1) opportunity recognition & catalysts for technology transfer; 2) participants’ roles in
technology transfer activities & relationships with spin-off firms; 3) time demands; 4) learning and
identification of mistakes; 5) success factors; and, 6) outcomes.
6.3.2.1 Opportunity recognition & catalysts for technology transfer
In their narrative descriptions of their technology transfer activities, some of the participants provided
insight into the ways that they identified research projects of interest or the ways that they identified
opportunities for technology transfer. The participants’ involvement in university-industry
interactions appeared to be an important factor in the recognition of research and technology transfer
opportunities. In other cases, opportunities to transfer technology were influenced by the availability
of resources for commercialization, especially human capital, or the difficulty in identifying
established firms that were interested in commercializing the technology.
An important factor in the recognition of research opportunities was the participants’ exposure to
industry. As mentioned in section 0, many of the participants engaged in a wide range of universityindustry interactions and these interactions often started well before any formal transfers. Many
participants identified these interactions as an important source of interesting problems.7 The most
extreme case of industry involvement in problem selection was the use by one participant of informal
and formal groups, which included industry contacts, with whom he would discuss and prioritize
research problems. Not all research projects were selected based on the participants’ familiarity with
the industry. Other factors that led researchers to select research projects included the social value of
the research project, the extent to which it offered a possibility to increase the university’s reputation,
7

Some of the excerpts that demonstrate this phenomenon are included under the ‘Outcomes’ theme.

<-----Page 98----->85
and the opportunity for student learning, in that it was an appropriate topic for a graduate thesis. In
some cases, applied research projects themselves appeared to increase participants’ awareness of the
market; “during the project, we were also exposed, through conferences and visitors, to people who
wanted to use the technology.”
The participants’ exposure to industry also appeared to be an important factor in the recognition of
opportunities for technology transfer. In the most direct case, a business person familiar with the
industry approached the research group and suggested that they form a venture. In many of the other
cases, university researchers appear to have decided that technologies presented opportunities and
appeared confident in their abilities to assess market forces. For example, one participant observed,
“We knew, having looked at the market, that there was a need.” Another commented, “The tools that
we had developed seemed like the basis of a company or a business plan.” A third participant made
an explicit link between his interactions with industry and his ability to recognize opportunities:
[I knew there was a market for the technology because] being a
technical person, I go to conferences, I go to trade shows. I can see
which way the market is going … it would be important to this
industry because then they can have a faster manufacturing line. That
doesn’t take an Einstein to figure out.”
Another important aspect of opportunity recognition was the availability of resources for
commercialization. Several ventures were created because individuals involved in the research group
were leaving the university, either as recent graduates of research degrees or as staff or faculty
members from the research group who desired a career change. A participant noted:
Some people in the research group decided that they had enough of
working within the university. They wanted to go out and try new
things; they were all going to go out and get big jobs. We
recognized that these people were very bright and they had a bit of
an entrepreneurial bent to them, so we suggested we would finance a
company, set them up in business.
Many technology transfers occurred through spin-offs rather than through licences. In many of these
cases, the faculty inventors unsuccessfully sought to license their technologies to established
businesses before deciding to start new ventures, or pursued spin-off formation because they thought
that the invention wasn’t sufficiently appropriable to be licensed.8 This finding suggests that
modeling technology transfers as a free choice between licensing and forming spin-offs is invalidated
in many cases by the lack of receptor capacity. DiGregorio (2003) had suggested that faculty
inventors may choose to form spin-offs rather than engage in licensing if the returns from spin-off
activity are expected to be greater. This reasoning was not provided by any of participants
interviewed in this study.

8

Some of the comments to this effect are provided under the theme ‘Experiences with Technology Transfer
Support Organizations.’

<-----Page 99----->86
In summary, it appears that faculty inventors’ participation in a broad range of universityindustry interactions allows them to identify research projects with industry significance and
recognize technology transfer opportunities. Another factor that was mentioned in multiple cases,
was the availability of resources for commercialization, especially human capital. Counter to
DiGregorio’s theory, the likelihood of achieving a higher payoff through spin-off formation versus
licensing, did not appear to be a factor. Instead, many of the participants explored licensing first and
turned to spin-off formation when a receptor organization for the technology could not be identified.
6.3.2.2 Participants’ roles in technology transfer activities & relationships with spin-off firms
The participants’ roles in technology transfer activities varied substantially across the different types
of transfers and, among the spin-offs, across the different relationships between the participant and
the firm. In many cases, the participants were key actors in the technology transfers. They were lead
people in arranging patenting and licensing or they took on leadership roles within the management
structure and technical staff of the spin-offs. In other cases, the participants took on a supporting role,
providing technical support and doing “missionary work,” which typically consisted of doing
presentations, teaching courses or leading workshops to develop interest in the spin-off’s products or
services. This role suggests that even the inventors who remained within the university had
substantial contact with industry and thus the opportunity to develop business knowledge.
Several of the professors who were involved with spin-offs chose to remain within the university.
In many of these cases, other individuals who left the university to work in the spin-off took on
leadership roles. There was no obvious relationship between the extent to which a faculty member
was central to the technology transfer and the success of that transfer in making the technology
available to users, in job creation, or in producing a substantial return for investors.
The participants’ roles evolved over time. A couple of individuals reported that the people who left
the university to join the spin-off firms found their roles evolving away from research towards
management. For example, participants reported that:
My board of directors advised me that I had to let go the research;
had to let somebody else run the research of the company and I did.
We were very fortunate in that the people who left the university and
who were really operationally running the business, were able to go
through those various levels … In the early days, the managers were
in on every aspect of the product, then they’d say, ‘Here’s the
general scope, here’s what we want’ … the managers were able to
keep going to different levels of the organization, realizing that they
could not micromanage stuff.
The individuals who remained with the university reported that their relationships with the spin-offs
grew less close over time, observing that, “it didn’t need its close ties with the university anymore,”
and, “any organization, once it’s set up, takes on a life of its own … they diverged because they had

<-----Page 100----->87
to.” In the interviews, the tone of these remarks suggested that faculty inventors were comfortable
with this evolution. Another participant expressed this comfort explicitly:
I view the company’s growth a lot like raising a child: starting very
small and nurturing it, playing an advisory role with it as it gets a
little older, being cut off completely for a couple of years because the
company thinks it can do a lot better without you, and then slowly
recognizing where you can contribute and you come back in to play
and the relationship gets re-established on good terms. And that’s
sort of very much the way that my work with the company has
worked. And it’s been fine with me.
The individual role of a faculty member appears to hinge on the extent to which they were interested
in taking part in business activities, as opposed to their attitudes to technology transfer in general. A
participant who elected to leave the university to work full-time in his spin-off noted, “I felt that, if I
could use [my invention] and develop real products and have some effect on science by developing
those things, it would be great fun to do,” whereas, a participant who remained within the university
said:
I’m not quite entrepreneurial in the same sense that some other
people are because I don’t have the business interests in working
with the company and getting it going. I thought it was a good thing.
I was definitely interested in seeing it happen but I was not the one to
figure out how to make a company work and I was not about to give
up my job here in order to get into the company, either.
In summary, the participants’ roles evolved across time, and varied across different technology
transfer activities and, for those engaged with spin-off companies, the different relationships they had
with the spin-off firm. However, there was no clear relationship between the role of the faculty
inventor(s) and outcomes of the transfer.
6.3.2.3 Time demands
The different roles held by the participants had a substantial impact on the time demands created by
their decisions to engage in technology transfer. A number of individuals reported that the time
associated with the technology transfer simply displaced their other consulting activities and thus did
substantially influence the distribution or size of their workload. A participant described his
technology transfer activities as taking place, “once a week for a couple of hours. It was like
consulting.” Other individuals reported doing up to the equivalent of a second full-time job.
I worked forty hours a week at the university; I had a huge number
of graduate students. I worked for the company probably twenty to
thirty, sometimes forty extra hours a week. So it was a fairly tiring
time. It was hard physically, it was hard mentally.

<-----Page 101----->88
This was most often the case with individuals who had high levels of involvement with a spin-off,
while maintaining much of their regular professorial workload within the university.
The faculty inventors acknowledged that time management was a significant concern. Almost all
of the faculty inventors who maintained their university roles while taking on significant involvement
with technology transfers acknowledged, explicitly and without prompting, the importance of
ensuring that their teaching, research and service at the university did not suffer from their other
activities. This commitment to a ‘boundary-spanning’ role was facilitated by the ability to take leaves
of absence or sabbaticals to work on the spin-off, or to arrange to have reduced teaching and service
loads by having the spin-off reimburse the university for some or all of their salary.
In conclusion, the participants’ comments regarding the time demands associated with involvement
in technology transfer activities suggested that the time demands varied depending on the faculty
inventor’s role but that, for some faculty inventors, the time demands were substantial. This strongly
suggests that policies and programs that allow the faculty inventor to reduce their university load for a
period will be effective tools in encouraging faculty members to engage in technology transfer.
6.3.2.4 Learning and identification of mistakes
Many participants identified things that they had learned during their technology transfer activities or
mistakes that they had made. The majority of the learnings demonstrated a focus on non-technical
issues. For example:
It is a difficult market … very niche, very narrow and established.
I was looking down on understanding the law. Later on, when I was
hit hard, then I said, ‘Oh! You have to understand the laws.
One of the things I would certainly consider, is moving the company
into the U.S. in a much earlier stage so that it would have access to
the grants that are available in the United States for company
development. There’s nothing in Canada that matches.
It’s important to choose your partners carefully.
There seem to be two kinds of businesses in the technology world.
In one kind of business is you’ve got a good idea and now you have
to figure out who would ever want to buy it and why. So you have to
create a market place. That’s hard. The other idea is they absolutely
need this product because if they don’t have it, their business will be
destroyed.
If you’re going to commercialize something, patents are pretty
important things.

<-----Page 102----->89
These comments suggest that, through their experiences, the participants constructed and refined
their understanding of non-technical as well as the technical issues related to industry.
6.3.2.5 Success factors
When attributing their success in applied research projects and technology transfer activities to
various factors, the participants tended to discuss non-technical success factors. These included:
[Publications have helped me develop contacts] hundreds of times …
It leads to agencies wanting you to look at some research problems.
I try to keep aware of what’s going on in the financial world and
other things like that and I think that’s helped me in trying to
understand the impacts and the relevance of a large amount of things
that I do in research…
There’s an old saying, “The devil is in the details.” Of course it is in
the details but you have to hire people that you can trust to look after
the details.
The two reasons for success: one is we pay attention to detail and
the other is we stay on the problem long enough to solve it… We
stay on the problem once we identify that this is really what we want
to do.
Like the learnings and mistakes identified by the participants, the success factors demonstrate that the
participants are attuned to a wide range of business issues beyond technological factors.
6.3.2.6 Outcomes
In telling the stories of their experiences with technology transfer, participants often described various
outcomes resulting from their activities, in which they feel pride or satisfaction in having achieved or
frustration at not having achieved. These outcomes provide insight into the participant’s goals for
technology transfer and their definitions for success. In review, the outcomes cited were found to be
quite diverse. Participants were most likely to describe the impact of their university-industry
activities upon their students, in terms of the virtues of the technology, in terms of the broader impact
on the university and the economy, and in terms of the extent to which the activities themselves were
enjoyable.
The advantages that participants felt that they were able to offer their students included access to
more interesting problems to solve in graduate work, better opportunities to conduct research by using
an international network of researchers and industry contacts, contact with potential employers
through applied research projects, and access to teaching that balances theory and applications. For
example, one participant observed:

<-----Page 103----->90
A student that I met with at a conference last week, he is an executive with a big
technology company. If I didn’t interact with industry, I wouldn’t
have given him a good project, good leadership and good advice so
that he could achieve what he achieved with his Ph.D. thesis. I think,
overall, that my students, my Ph.D. students, also benefited from my
activities.
With respect to the value provided by their technology, several participants focused on the usefulness
of their technologies, often expressed as positive feedback from users. Examples include:
…one of our test users was so in love with the invention that he
didn’t want to give it up. We took this as the supreme compliment.
I’ve had very beautifully inscribed letters from users, thanking me
and that sort of thing. I’ve been on the local news, [laughs] and so
on. And that, in a way, is rewarding.
[The benefits of university-industry technology transfer are] two
things: interesting problems and how to modify what we were doing
so it would be more useful. Don’t we all want to feel that we are
being useful?
The goal of bringing technology into use was also indicated by a participant who was frustrated by
the lack of success with respect to a technology transfer attempt:
The dissatisfaction here is that this a design that people could be
using. I’m not worried about the money involved; I’m not even
thinking about that. I’m just thinking here is a design that people
could be benefiting from but it’s not out there now because of the
myopic view of industry. I’m bordering on anger…
An alternate perspective on the way the participants’ value of their technology was provided the
statement, “I’m also really proud of our technology; our technology is leading edge.”
Several participants took pride in the impact of their technology transfer activities on the university
community and the broader economy:
I always felt that one of the most satisfying things was the number of
people working at the company. These are Canadians who have
good jobs, they’re taking home money, they’re paying taxes. It’s
good for the Canadian economy, it’s good for everybody.
I feel that I contributed quite a lot to the university but at the same
time I feel the university contributed to me. It’s mutual good feeling.

<-----Page 104----->91
The research project that led to the spin-off is the activity that I’m
most proud to have been involved in. The spin-off activity is
probably lower because I value the research and teaching aspects
of what I do higher than the commercialization. On the other
hand, I recognize the importance of the commercial activity, in
contributing to the community, having it pay back the university in
many ways through hiring of people from here and through direct
funding back into the university, through research contracts and
through donations. Those things are very, very important
contributions.
A number of participants described the technology transfer activities as intrinsically rewarding, noting
that the activities were fun, interesting, challenging, and that, “It’s been an interesting life; the years
have gone by extremely fast.” These comments suggest that the participants derive value from the
experiences themselves, as opposed to their outcomes.
Other outcomes cited included the development of a network of contacts beyond academe,
increased stature in the research community as result of making research more accessible, better
publications resulting from the broader awareness of issues developed by doing work with industry.
Overall, three aspects of the outcomes cited by participants are especially noteworthy. Firstly,
none of the participants cited their personal financial gains as a source of pride even though several
transfers demonstrated significant returns on investments. This finding doesn’t appear consistent with
the expectation that financial rewards for technology transfer activities are a significant driver of
behaviour. Secondly, the set of rewards are quite diverse and include effects on students, colleagues,
the university and the wider community. If the anticipation of these benefits are significant drivers of
involvement in technology transfer, models of faculty inventors motivations will have to be
significantly more complex than they have been to date. Finally, the existence of this broad set of
emotionally-significant outcomes and the presence of intrinsic motivators suggests that faculty
inventors may be emotionally invested in their activities. Modeling the faculty inventor as a rational
economic actor, who is primarily influenced by cost-benefit analyses, will not account for these
effects.
6.3.3 University Environment
This theme explores several aspects of the university environment that appear to influence technology
transfer activities. This top-level theme is further divided into four themes: 1) peers and group
norms; 2) academic leadership; 3) university culture; and, 4) experiences with Technology Transfer
Support Organizations (TTSOs).
6.3.3.1 Peers and group norms
Interactions with peers and the research group or departmental norms that are upheld by these
interactions are expected to encourage or inhibit technology transfer. Some participants described
their colleagues to be unsupportive of their technology transfer activities. Those who found their

<-----Page 105----->92
colleagues unsupportive of their activities described the colleagues’ objections as stemming from:
1) envy; 2) the attitude that applied work isn’t intellectually challenging; 3) the idea that having
connections with industry mean that you can’t be a real scientist; or, 4) the belief that the faculty
inventor is “getting rich at the expense of the university.” This last participant also observed, “It was
not a good situation for me.” When prompted, other participants either described their colleagues as
having attitudes ranging from very unsupportive to very supportive, or hadn’t experienced any
difficulties at all. These participants attributed the supportive attitudes of their peers to a broad
acceptance of spin-off activity at the University of Waterloo, deriving in part from experiences of
some of the benefits including access to contract research funding provided to the university by
successful spin-offs.
Overall, there was no clear relationship between group norms as expressed by colleagues’
comments and the participants’ behaviour. However, at least one participant found his colleagues’
disapproval to be troubling. This suggests that group norms may be a factor in some situations even
if it wasn’t generally the case at the University of Waterloo.
6.3.3.2 Academic leadership
The extent to which university administrators, including department chairs, deans, vice-presidents and
presidents support technology transfer activities can also be expected to encourage or inhibit
technology transfer on campus. Most participants described the university’s administrators as very
supportive of technology transfer activities. Since the participants experience with technology
transfer span many years, many different administrators were identified by name as supportive of
technology transfer. Some participants reported that they felt encouraged to engage in technology
transfer because they saw the administration as supportive of independent action. One participant
described this as a trust relationship:
I think there was a lot of trust too in those days. The trust was
primarily internal, like from the dean to the chair of the department,
the administrators trusted you to go out and do something useful and
they gave you literally free rein to do it.
Another participant observed, “you never felt that you were being held back. That you shouldn’t go
out and do things” and that, “one of the vice-presidents of research, even to this day, whenever I see
him he asks about the company.” In yet another case, a faculty inventor who offered to develop the
technology within the university was directly urged to commercialize it through an independent spinoff:
We really tried to set an organization up within the university and
so we had meetings with university administrators. I remember
one day the Vice President of Research said, “Why don’t you just
set this thing up outside the university?” I said, “Well, there
certainly would be less red tape and that seemed to be a good
idea.” … That was a very significant moment because it was
almost a sigh of relief. I didn’t want to rip the university off. I

<-----Page 106----->93
wanted the university to have every opportunity to participate if
they wanted to but it became obvious that there were so many
problems that it would have been better for us to do it ourselves.
All of us in the start-up breathed a sigh of relief, when they said,
“Why don’t you take it outside?” That was a famous moment.
More than one participant had had experiences with an administrator whom they found to be
unsupportive of their involvement in technology transfer. The behaviours that communicated this
lack of support, included failing to honour deals with faculty inventors who wanted to have their spinoff cover some or all of their salaries so that they could carry reduced loads in order to spend time
with a new venture. The administrator is alleged to have penalized them for the reduced loads when
they wished to retire, in violation of the agreements. These behaviours were attributed to the
administrator’s lack of support for technology transfer because they appeared to target those
professors with substantial involvement in contract research and technology transfer selectively.
Overall, the general consensus was that many individuals in the university’s administration had
been very supportive over many years. The message received by most of the participants was that
they were empowered to engage in technology transfer. However, it was also clear that, for a few
participants, a single administrator had done a lot to sour their experiences. Therefore, academic
leadership was an important factor in determining faculty member’s behaviours and experiences.
6.3.3.3 University culture
Many participants described the university and its culture when reviewing their careers and describing
their technology transfer experiences and most of their descriptions of the university culture depicted
it as changing significantly. In the early days of the university, the university is described as an
exciting, entrepreneurial place, full of innovative and eclectic people and opportunities for individuals
to push themselves and to contribute to building something. One participant mentioned that taking a
job at the university was taking a gamble because it was such a new institution. In describing that
time, another participant noted that the university was growing during a “revolution of young
people,” which was “an era that was very amenable or conducive to doing what you want…it was a
different era than today.” As these descriptions approached present day, many participants talked
about increasing bureaucratization, “like a creeping fungus” and a loss of entrepreneurial spirit,
although a couple of participants also voiced their opinions that the environment attracted people with
energy and enthusiasm or a an interest in technology transfer.
These descriptions of early experiences within the university suggest that the university may have
been more likely than other universities to hire faculty members who were relatively high risk-takers
because the faculty hired by the university had to be willing to work in an institution that was not yet
established. The experience of building new programs in a time when the university had few rules
and procedures may have been a formative experience for new faculty members. It also may have led
to the retention of staff members and graduate students that otherwise would have left the university
environment. Thus the university’s culture over time could have changed as its reputation increased
and it became a more desirable environment for more conservative individuals. Certainly the
university has had to introduce more policies and regulations relative to the early days in which,

<-----Page 107----->94
“everyone, including the graduate students, could go to a party at one house.” In conclusion, the
university’s early culture appears to have been conducive to technology transfer by attracting risk
takers and by empowering individuals to contribute to the university in their own way.
6.3.3.4 Experiences with Technology Transfer Support Organizations (TTSOs).
Many participants discussed the university’s Technology Transfer and Licensing Office (TTLO).
However, some participants discussed other organizations external to the university that filled much
the same function; these organizations are henceforth referred to as External Technology Transfer
Supports Organizations (ETTSOs). These types of technology transfer support organizations are
widely expected to act as brokers between faculty inventors and companies that wish to contract or
license research and to support the formation of university spin-off firms by mediating between
academic and corporate culture. In a recent Canadian study, less than half of the faculty members
interviewed acknowledged this role; university administrators were much more likely to do so
(Fisher & Atkinson-Grosjean, 2002). In this study, about half of the participants in this study
acknowledged the role that the TTLO or an ETTSO had had in at least one of their technology
transfer activities.
A genuinely surprising finding from this study is the extent to which the participants’ comments
were negative. The TTLO and the ETTSOs were valued for their provision of resources in the form
of money for patenting, or contacts. None of the comments acknowledged a brokerage role beyond
infrequent mentions of resources provided by the support organizations. Furthermore, several of the
participants shared stories that alledged that TTLO or ETTSO staff members had behaved unethically
by seeking to profit personally from their activities in a manner inconsistent with their positions or
had engaged in other questionable practices. Other stories conveyed frustration with their
experiences with the organizations. For example, one participant felt unsupported while he struggled
with the patent office’s response to his patent application. Another participant recounted asking the
TTLO not to license his invention to a certain company because he knew them to act dishonestly only
to have them grant that company an exclusive licence. Yet another decided to reject the TTLO’s
offer to help with subsequent patents after the office decided not to assist him with the first patent.
Finally, a participant was quite angry when the equity that he provided was transferred to a TTSO and
thus didn’t provide any value to the university as a whole.
When asked why they had not chosen to approach the TTLO for assistance, several other
participants indicated that the TTLO couldn’t help them because the TTLO’s only strength was in
licensing and their product was unsuitable for licensing or that the TTLO’s systems were so
bureaucratic that involvement with the office would be more constraining than it would be beneficial.
The participants seemed to be skeptical of the extent to which the TTLO could help them although a
few of them mitigated these comments by observing that they had had little interaction with the
TTLO. One participant also added that it appeared that the office was staffed by good people who
tried hard but that the office was understaffed and demoralized by their struggle to live up to faculty
inventor’s expectations.
At this juncture, it is important to observe that this study is not an attempt to present a historical or
investigative account in which the facts have been verified with multiple types of sources. Instead,

<-----Page 108----->95
the purpose of this account is to present the faculty inventors’ perspectives and it is only based on
their accounts. This subsection is important from this perspective, and only from this perspective,
because it makes it clear that the TTLO and ETTSOs have failed to make a positive impression on
this cohort of faculty inventors. This lack of trust in the competence of the TTSOs has almost
certainly increased faculty inventors’ propensities to commercialize inventions independently of the
TTSOs.
6.3.3.5 Summary of the university environment
This set of four sub-themes has addressed four aspects of the university environment that were
identified through the interview process. Some participants found most of their colleagues to be
supportive of their technology transfer activities; others were accused of prostituting science and the
university. The university’s administration was widely cited as an instigator of technology transfer
activities. In particular, participants appeared to be empowered to act independently because of an
implicit understanding that it was acceptable, even desirable. The university’s culture was most often
described as having been very empowering because, during the years in which new programs were
introduced and the university expanded very quickly, there was a sense of tremendous excitement and
involvement and because there were few rules and procedures to constrain the faculty inventor.
However, the problems with alleged unethical behaviour on the part of an employee in the university
TTLO were probably consequences of this unregulated environment. What is clear from faculty
inventors’ accounts is that the TTLO has not established a good reputation with the cohort of
interviewees.
6.3.4 Rewards and Reward Systems
This theme contains vignettes related to rewards and rewards systems related to technology transfer
activities. These rewards systems are elements of the university environment; they were captured in
this top-level theme because of their importance with respect to this thesis. This top-level theme is
further divided into three themes: 1) Intellectual Property (IP) policies; 2) financial rewards; and, 3)
other reward systems.
6.3.4.1 Intellectual Property (IP) policies
In discussions of IP policies, most participants were adamant that the University of Waterloo IP
policy was a contributing factor to high levels of technology transfer, and especially spin-off
company formation at the university. The reasons offered for this were manifold but tended not to be
directly linked to experiences that the participants had had. Instead, the descriptions tended to
describe the advantages of the University of Waterloo policy over other universities, with which the
participants had had no experience, or relative to hypothetical situations. The interpretation of these
comments is somewhat more complex.
The following excerpt provides insight into the participant’s understanding of the important factors
by presenting the course of events that he imagines would occur if the University of Waterloo
adopted a university-ownership position:

<-----Page 109----->96
In most cases, would it make a huge difference in how things
actually end up? Like who makes how much money from what?
How much does the university gain? How much does the
individual gain on the projects that get commercialized? Probably
not because there’s already a sharing between individuals and the
university in various ways. A reasonable university would
probably still try to encourage the individuals by actually paying
them fairly richly for doing the commercialization and allow the
same kind of activity to go on. So, in the instances where
commercial activity takes place, my guess is it would be structured
very similarly to the way they are now. I don’t think as many
would take place. Certainly, not in the short run at Waterloo. I
think that there’d be a big drop. What’s worse is that, in the long
run, the potential would go down because we would hire fewer
entrepreneurial-type people. I’m absolutely convinced of that. It
would be a very bad move for Waterloo.
This comment acknowledges that it would be possible for the university to share financial rewards
and allow “the same kind of activity to go on” but predicts that there would be a big drop in activity.
If individuals are rewarded richly for involvement in activities that are “structured very similarily to
the way they are now,” nothing has changed except the ownership of the IP. A review of the other
excerpts suggests two possible reasons why faculty inventors may attribute so much importance to the
ownership of the IP. The first possible explanation is that the ownership of the IP has been imbued
with emotional and cultural significance. The second possible explanation pertains to the perceived
limitations of the university Technology Transfer and Licensing Office.
The following excerpt is evidence that IP may have been imbued with emotional and cultural
significance:
One of the things that Waterloo has done, that I think is a catalyst for
what’s happened to Waterloo in terms of turning out new companies,
is that Waterloo has encouraged people to put the results of their
work into practice. And they’ve done that by allowing the people
who do the research to own the results of the research. … I think the
feeling is that it’s part of what the university wants us to do. And you
then go the extra step and see it applied.
If you’re going to do a lot of extra work, if you’re going to do the
eighty hours a week to get something going and the university
owns ninety percent of it, whatever you produce, then you will
lose incentive to do it. And it’s not only the money, it’s control.
You know that you worked your buns off and in the end it doesn’t
matter because if the university owns the technology and they
decide that you’re not going to use it in that way and then
everything you worked for could be destroyed in a moment. I
mean, if you do it, if you own it, then you’re responsible for it for

<-----Page 110----->97
better of for worse. If you make a mistake, then you suffer. If you
do well, then you see things grow. You don’t have that other
ownership body out there who really controls what you’re doing
and has the ultimate say in what you’re doing. It’s also pride, I
think, and you do something because you want to see it flourish.
The most important [way to foster academic entrepreneurship], is the
one I mentioned. That the intellectual property rights reside with the
researcher. The sense of ownership… it’s more, “Is this a part of
you?” You’re reputation is on the line. It’s your idea that’s on the
line. So it’s more a sense of ownership, I think, than pride.
This participant explicitly identifies the feeling of ownership as opposed to the contractual definition
of ownership. This perspective strongly suggests that legal ownership of the IP also has emotional
and cultural significance. The emotional significance appears to derive from identifying closely with
the technology and the technology transfer. The cultural significance is the empowering message that
the university recognizes this identification on the part of the inventors and entrusts the further
development to them.
This quote also suggests that ownership may have a broader significance:
I think we’ve been so successful because I think one of our key
features here is the intellectual property policy, which basically says,
“You create it, you own it.” Other institutions have much more
complicated policies. There’s an attempt to require that the
university should share in the ownership. When that happens, the
first thing that happens is you get into discussions as to who owns
what. You know, if I have an idea in this office and then I rent a
garage down the street and do all my work in the garage down the
street, does the university have a share? I don’t have any idea how
you decide that. So, you don’t want to even go there. I mean, can
you imagine if I have an idea and then I go and try and sell it, and get
into an adversarial situation where the university is challenging my
right to have ownership of this idea? Because they paid me to have
the idea didn’t they? I mean, paid my salary. Did I have the idea in
the shower? Did I have it in this office? I have no idea. This really
complicates situations very easily. If the university just says, “You
own them,” it is has eliminated a lot of the complication. First of all,
the IP policy’s simple. It’s a very good thing because frankly it
avoids a whole lot of wasted energy on trying to figure out what
make sense.
In this excerpt the participant is imagining his response to a university that claims some ownership of
his IP. His hypothetical response involves developing the technology in a garage down the street and,
possibly, having an adversarial experience with the university over his right to own and, presumably,
sell his idea independently of the institution. This excerpt suggests that this participant identifies
strongly with his IP.

<-----Page 111----->98
The second possible explanation is grounded in the statements by many of the participants that
their technology transfer activities would not be possible if the university owned the IP. In a number
of cases, these statements appear to be related to the lack of trust in the competence of the TTLO,
identified in section 6.3.3.4. Consider the following quotes:
I think that if the university-owner model were applied right across
the board to every bit of IP developed or every product or research
product or service, it would work fine for some. Others, like our type
of thing, it just doesn’t work. It wouldn’t be practical. I’m not sure
how other university-owner institutions operate but, I think there has
to be some flexibility in that.
…universities then often set up corporations to exploit this IP. They
hire people, some of these people are very competent, but, 1) they
probably don’t understand what it is they’re selling in many cases
and, 2) they don’t have any passion about it. They’re just selling
something. You don’t have the originator behind the idea, the person
who said, “I think this is just terrific. I’ve just got to go out and
make this happen.” I think there’s a real problem there. I think if
you look at some of these corporations that have been set up to
exploit university IP, they’re not very successful. I could be wrong
but that’s my sense.
I have personal opinions about how well the TTO works but I don’t
want to comment because I’ve never used them. We’ve always gone
our own way. We have enough collective understanding let’s say.
The university policy of inventor-ownership is supportive of this
spin-off formation. It means that the individuals have the option to
put more effort into something with the potential payoff to
themselves, as opposed to the university dictating that whatever the
individuals do, the university has the right to decide how things
happen with it and therefore you’re always subject to the university’s
whims: whether or not something can be commercialized in the way
that you think it should be or could be. My guess is that the
company wouldn’t have started if the intellectual property was
university-owned. Who within the university would have said,
‘Let’s do it?’ And how would the university have convinced us, the
people who actually did it, that we should do it on their behalf?
In several of these cases, participants argue that the Technology Transfer Offices are not capable of
managing technologies that are not highly appropriable or not able to support spin-off formation.
However, it seems highly likely that these views are shaped by the participants’ experiences lack of
confidence in the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office. Note, for example, that university
ownership would subject faculty inventors to the “whims” of the institution. This proposed

<-----Page 112----->99
relationship is consistent with the qualitative study that determined that, “faculty decisions to
disclose are shaped by their perceptions of the benefits of patent protection. These incentives to
disclose are magnified or minimized by the perceived costs of interacting with TTOs and licensing
professionals” (Owen-Smith & Powell, 2001). In both cases, perceptions of the TTOs interact with
the power of incentives to influence faculty inventor behaviour.
In conclusion, the participants’ discussion of the university IP policies suggests that the ownership
aspect of the University of Waterloo policy is highly attractive to faculty inventors. It also appears
that this attractiveness may be explained by some combination of two factors: 1) an emotional and
cultural significance to the ownership of IP that promotes identification with the technology and the
technology transfers and empowers inventors to engage in transfers independently of the university;
and, 2) a lack of confidence in the competence of the university’s Technology Transfer and Licensing
Office.
6.3.4.2 Financial rewards
The financial rewards governed by university IP policies have been a focus of most of the quantitative
work relating IP policies and technology transfer outcomes. In this thematic analysis, financial
rewards are discussed separately from IP policies because they were linked in so few of the
participants’ statements. Instead, financial rewards were justified by a description of the participants’
investments of time and money, seemingly in a cautious or defensive tone, or participants provided
evidence that financial rewards were not prime motivators. Several statements also discussed the
participant’s lack of desire to accrue and/or flaunt personal wealth and the inadvisability of this
approach in the context of academe.
The following quotes, expressed by individuals who received impressive returns on their
investments in technology transfers, are examples where the participant appears to be justifying their
personal gain:
Everybody who worked on the research project that was the basis
for the spin-off was given an opportunity to invest. I had
reasonable access to money, so I was able to invest without risk.
In other words, if the money disappeared, it disappeared. I wasn’t
going to cry. Well, I’d cry but not very much. So we were all in
this together. We continued to do our research but we invested in
a little company that was just starting up. We were always very
careful to make sure that we always did our job at the university
and we followed the policies and rules at the university very
carefully. It wasn’t the case that it was all very well orchestrated
because you can not ever create the perception that working at the
university is a way to get rich because it isn’t. There’s nothing
wrong with making investments. We all do that. It’s called the
stock market, bond market or whatever. If we can work together
so that we both win, that’s a good thing to do, which is what
happened. So, I want to be very careful how one says that because

<-----Page 113----->100
it can be very easily misinterpreted.
You have to have some motivation for the people doing it. I don’t
think the commercialization always happened as much without that
incentive. People will just pursue their research. Why do people,
who are just doing pure research, who aren’t doing
commercialization, why do they publish in journals? There are three
reasons. First, they want to let their colleagues know what they’re
doing, and they want to be able to read what their colleagues are
doing. The second thing is it’s publish or perish, right? And the
third is you don’t get research money unless you publish. These
things would happen but not to the extent that they happen without
the monetary incentives. Also, we did a lot of research as part of our
jobs but we also spent a lot of time that wasn’t the university time
pursuing these things.
Other participants talked about how financial goals were secondary goals in the technology transfer
process:
I’m more interested in having satisfied users, just to talk to them and
say, ‘How are you finding it?’ and have their eyes light up and them
say, “It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread.” If, afterwards, I
made a little money that would be a benefit but that wasn’t a
certainty at that stage of the game. In fact, if it was money that I was
interested in I might have taken a different route. I would have
short-circuited some of the things to get to the answer quicker.
The third set of quotes discussed the acquisition of personal wealth and conspicuous consumption.
Two participants were quite clear that they were not interested in engaging in conspicuous
consumption:
When I say I am not interested in money, all it means is that I’m
not interested in accumulating personal monetary worth … Now
the company has to be profitable. If the company is not profitable
it will not create more technology. I’m interested in technology. If
you look at the core values of this company you’ll find that our
aim is to create better and better technology but to do that you
need money, therefore you have to be profitable. And I know how
to look after a company to make sure that it is profitable. But I’m
not personally interested in a lot of money. There is a limit on how
much I can eat, there is a limit how much I can wear, there is a
limit on how much I can travel. Those needs could be satisfied, not
with millions, but maybe with thousands ... I could afford to have
a house which is 200,000 square feet with swimming pools and
extravaganza and all that. I’m not interested. I’m interested in
comfortable clothes. For example, the shirt I’m wearing probably
cost $30 or $40. If I was interested in money, I would get a shirt

<-----Page 114----->101
which cost $400 or $500. I got a present, an Armani shirt which
cost $400. But I really don’t need a $400 shirt. You see the
difference?
When entrepreneurs outside of academia, make it big, they expose it.
Like an entrepreneur friend of mine and his Ferrari. In that culture
that’s one of the marks of success. Counting wealth in an academic
institution is, in my opinion, not smart. You don’t see me driving up
here in a Rolls Royce. I own a modest car, I mean it’s a nice car, but
it’s a modest car. I don’t own a Ferrari, I’m not interested in one and
all that stuff.
Like the second of the two prior quotes, a third quote on the topic of conspicuous consumption
suggests that it may be counter to norms for acceptable behaviour within the university:
I think in academia, you can create real serious problems for yourself
if you talk about making money through technology transfer.
Academia does not celebrate wealth. That’s crass, that’s
commercial. They celebrate other things, they celebrate
publications, they celebrate good teaching, they celebrate honours:
The Order of Canada, Fellow of the Society of Canada, and that kind
of stuff. There is a different set of criteria by which they measure
success. You can be poor as a church mouse but, by God, you’ve got
three hundred publications. Now, is that good or bad? I’m not going
to comment. It’s all where you stand.
Overall, the excerpts related to financial rewards suggest that this type of success is not widely
accepted, much less celebrated within the University of Waterloo. In other words, the desirability of
this outcome may be attenuated by group norms through interactions with peers. As a result,
financial incentives may have less power to motivate behaviour. Alternatively, the participants may
have been conditioned to devalue the significance of financial rewards in shaping their own
behaviour. Therefore, it isn’t clear from these self-reports to what extent these rewards motivate
engagement in technology transfer relative to other possible outcomes or to what extent the negative
social dynamics surrounding financial rewards decreases their appeal.
The other implication of this finding is a practical issue. The lack of acceptance means that a focus
on financial performance may be quite divisive within the university and increase the likelihood that
those faculty members engaged in technology transfer experience conflicts with their colleagues. The
outcomes that appear to be more acceptable are identified in the ‘Outcomes’ section and include
positive impacts on scholarship, mentoring of graduate students, teaching performance, the university
and the regional or national economy.
6.3.4.3 Other reward systems
Four vignettes identified factors within the university, pertaining to the tenure and promotion system,
that didn’t support applied research or technology transfer effectively. The first vignette notes that

<-----Page 115----->102
tenure and promotion committees do not recognize industry outreach activities, like offering
workshops and courses, as significant activities even though they transfer knowledge to industry
much more effectively than publications in at least some fields. The second vignette was offered by a
participant who had excelled in all areas of his university career, including teaching. He feels
strongly that universities should allow its faculty members to specialize in pure research, applied
research, or teaching, provided that they maintain high standards of quality. The rationale provided is
that the faculty members and the university would benefit from allowing individuals to specialize
rather than pursue excellence across a range of activities. The third vignette suggests that bottom-up
approaches to university-industry interactions are far more effective than large top-down
developments, and that a problem with the university environment is the extent to which the
promotion system discourages risk-taking. The fourth vignette notes that the promotion and tenure
system doesn’t promote interactions with industry because it is incapable of recognizing design work.
This fourth vignette further suggests that this gap is problematic in the applied disciplines because
application is part of the motivation for the work; it is the stage that provides satisfaction to the
applied scientist:
Applied math and science students are rewarded by the phenomenon,
‘Look, Ma, what I built!’ Whereas pure math and science students
very often are rewarded by the Eureka phenomenon, ‘Now I
understand!’ Well, for a lot of applied students, understanding
something isn’t the end of it. How do you apply it? To what? Build
what? That’s why many of those students, once they graduate, get
somewhat alienated from the university. The university’s rewards
system isn’t involved in this sort of, ‘Look, Ma, what I built!’ sort of
thing. It’s, ‘Look, Ma, what I now understand.’
These diverse views on university reward systems reflect the evolving concerns of academics as the
“second revolution” increases university-industry interactions and the universities experience
increasing pressure to demonstrate their social value and relevance. These suggestions and others like
them are of interest because they may represent opportunities for university administrators to
introduce supports for high quality applied research and technology transfer activities.
6.3.5 Attitudes
This theme captures information regarding the participants’ attitudes towards research directions and
the role of the professor and/or the university in society and some descriptions of those aspects of
being a professor that they do or don’t enjoy. Therefore, this top-level theme is further divided into
two themes: 1) attitudes; and, 2) job elements and job satisfaction.
6.3.5.1 Attitudes
The researchers made a number of statements that revealed some of their attitudes towards
appropriate research directions. These attitudes included the beliefs that: 1) basic (or pure) and
applied research co-evolve; 2) that universities researchers should do long-term research not shortterm research; 3) that research directions need to be flexible enough to pursue significant work rather

<-----Page 116----->103
than clinging tightly to a mission; and, 4) that research in the applied disciplines should balance
between doing research in order to produce new knowledge with no concern for practical application
and producing practical solutions with no concern for generating new knowledge. Short excerpts
demonstrating these attitudes include:
Applications feed the theory and theory feeds the applications. It
seems to me there’s got to be that interaction.
…it’s not the short-term goal that you should be pursuing it. It’s the
long term goal. It’s to light the path so that you or other people then
can do the applications in the future.
There’s too much focused research, mission-oriented research. If
you make it too narrow I think it’s going to choke off things … if
you have the flexibility to go in the direction and the inclination to
apply what you’re doing then I think having a greater flexibility has
a much greater social value in the long run.
If you get to be at a point where you’re just a minion of the industry
then what will happen is you will gradually be shifted from
fundamental research to being a product designer because product
design is the thing that industry wants. … The researcher wants to
generate new information that people can use. A lot of universities
couldn’t even care whether it’s useful. ... They’re the two ends of the
spectrum. … our faculty’s role is to act as an interlocutor between
those two things.
When describing the faculty member’s role in relationships with industry, a participant suggested that
he acted as a ‘dictionary’ or ‘lexicon’ for industry and another described his role as that of an
‘interlocutor.’ All of these words imply that the faculty members are envisioning themselves in a
boundary-spanning role, making academia accessible to industry and vice versa. One participant
claimed that all academic work should be made available for application to other problems. Another
participant suggested that researchers that meet their obligations with respect to teaching, research,
and service should be free to engage in any extra-curricular activities, especially if they provide social
benefits. These elements all suggest that the boundary-spanning researchers in the participant group
hold attitudes that are quite positive towards technology transfer. This result coincides with Renault’s
finding that researchers who engage in technology transfer are more likely to hold non-traditional
views of academe, in which university-industry involvement is seen as a positive activity in at least
some contexts (Renault, 2006).
6.3.5.2 Job elements and job satisfaction
Another way to gain insight into individuals’ relationships with their jobs is to ask them to identify
the aspects of their work that they find rewarding. In the third interviews, many of the participants

<-----Page 117----->104
were asked to identify those aspects of being a professor that they found to be most enjoyable,
especially if they had chosen to remain in the university rather than join a spin-off company.
Two participants identified the autonomy that they experience as the best part of the position:
I think it is being my own boss…
[The best part about being a professor is that] I get to do what the
hell I like. I enjoyed the acting part of teaching and I enjoyed having
all these bright people around to sort of discuss and argue with and
being able to maintain that. But just freedom is the thing. You can’t
price that.
Several other participants discussed their engagement in research and problem-solving, in a manner
that suggested that these activities were intrinsically rewarding:
I let [my hands-on involvement in research] go but I didn’t give up
trying to stay with the technology: going to conferences,
understanding it, I’m just not doing hands on research. Sometimes I
miss it, so whenever I have to give a talk about technologies, I sit
down and I research. I enjoyed it very much, you know.
[The best part of my research day is] trying to come up with ideas
that make sense.
I think it is a beautiful subject. There’s a certain beauty to the logic.
But it’s very hard to explain to people who don’t know the field.
I like working on projects with colleagues. … I think the attraction
in working with colleagues is that quite often you’re plowing new
ground, in the sense that you’re solving new problems. As applied
scientists that’s what we like doing, you know.
Other aspects of their roles as professors that the participants found satisfying were interactions with
students and colleagues. One participant elaborated on his satisfaction with his position by adding
that he didn’t enjoy dealing with the details of research accounts and so on:
I don’t like the bureaucracy that goes along with some of the
research contracts and projects. … Particularly, now that our
university’s become more bureaucratic over time… I probably spend
much more time than I want to on dealing with the financial services
people and so on, keeping track of accounts and stuff like that.
Doing all the paperwork that goes along with research contracts.
That’s the drudgery of it.

6.3.6 Career Decisions
This theme includes excerpts related to two aspects of career management: 1) work/personal life
balance; and, 2) mid-career change.
6.3.6.1 Work/personal life balance
In cases where the participant experienced high time demands because of their involvement in
technology transfer, they were asked about the impact of these activities on their personal life. These
participants credited their families, and especially their spouses, as having been very supportive. In
most of these cases, the participants had wives who did not work outside the home and who “kept the
operation at home going” while the participants spent long hours at the university and in technology
transfer activities. A number of participants appeared to see the question as relevant to understanding
their experiences. For example, one prefaced his remark with, “That’s a good question.” Another
expanded on his experiences by observing that he had a friend, whose spouse had not been supportive
of his technology transfer activities, and that the time demands, “tore the marriage apart.”
This is of interest in a research context because it suggests that this first cohort of ‘academic
entrepreneurs’ were only able to pursue the technology transfer activities that they pursued because
their spouses were able to support them, in many cases, by taking on most of the responsibilities in
the home. The number of professors who currently experience this type of support of their
professional activities has declined probably as a result of changing social norms and the entry of
many women into the work force. For example, a recent quality of life survey at M.I.T. found that,
among tenured faculty, 65% of women and 29% of men are in dual-career families (Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, 2002). This reinforces the observation, first made under the ‘Time Demands’
theme, that university policies that govern a professor’s ability to take leaves of absence or
sabbaticals, or to carry reduced teaching and administrative loads are likely to be very important in
encouraging technology transfer.
6.3.6.2 Mid-career change
Some participants made it clear that their decision to move into a spin-off company was triggered by
a desire for a mid-career change. This desire was fuelled by a mixture of factors, including a fear that
personal research productivity was in decline, boredom with the university position after having held
it for many years, a desire to see research results put into use, and a desire to build a company, “where
you can see the results.”
The university pension system was identified as an obstacle to these mid-career changes, in that the
penalties for early retirement were viewed as prohibitive. As a result, at least one spin-off company
had a more gradual growth pattern until the Special Early Retirement Program was offered in 1996 as
a cost saving measure by the university. Obstacles to these mid-career shifts are undesirable, not just
because they may inhibit spin-off formation, but because they result in individuals who no longer
want to work within the university environment remaining because they feel trapped.

<-----Page 119----->106
In conclusion, flexible pension policies may encourage venture formation by releasing senior
professors who have accumulated commercializable technologies and know-how from the
university’s “golden handcuffs.”
6.3.7 Summary
The previous subsections have presented the themes derived from interviews with participants who
have had experience with technology transfer. Overall, these themes demonstrate that, even a small
number of serial entrepreneurs display a wide range of interests, concerns, and motivations in the
context of technology transfer. The next section discusses these findings and presents several ways in
which the findings can be linked to models of motivation.

6.4 Discussion
This discussion further synthesizes the thematic data by focusing on, firstly, the participants as
‘boundary-spanning’ professors and, secondly, their motivations.
6.4.1 Boundary-Spanning Professors and Business Knowledge
Most of the participants can be described as ‘boundary-spanning’ professors because they have
displayed a wide range of interactions with industry over a long period of time. This ‘boundaryspanning’ behaviour pattern is of interest because it provides faculty members with access to business
knowledge through university-industry interaction and business knowledge is likely to be critical
success factor, especially in the creation of university spin-offs. Section 2.2.2.2, in the literature
review, introduced the concern that faculty inventors are not likely to be able to transfer technology to
industry because their lack of business knowledge would prevent them from being able to make
critical decisions effectively, including, for example, the selection of an appropriate target market.
These predictions appear to be implicitly based on the understanding that the faculty members have
little exposure to the business world. This concern would suggest that the more central a faculty
inventor is to the technology transfer activities, the less likely the transfer is to succeed. No such
pattern was observed and the boundary-spanning researchers appeared to have a great deal of access
to business knowledge through their interactions with industry.
In four of the ‘University-Industry Interaction’ sub-themes, participants demonstrated access to and
acquisition of business knowledge. The activities described in the ‘Roles’ indicated that most of the
participants, even among those who remained in the university, had significant exposure to business
knowledge through involvement in “missionary work.” These efforts to build market interest in a
product or service, included providing workshops, seminars and courses, writing proposals, and
giving presentations to prospective clients. The excerpts associated with the ‘Opportunity
recognition’ sub-theme, suggest that many participants were able to identify opportunities for
licensing or venture creation using their own understanding of the market. This suggests that, even
before they were involved in technology transfer activities like licensing and spin-off formation, these
participants had developed substantial business knowledge. The large number of business issues,
raised in the excerpts associated with the ‘Learnings and identification of mistakes’ and ‘Success

<-----Page 120----->107
factors’ sub-themes, suggest that participants continued to develop and refine their business
knowledge through their technology transfer experiences. Overall, most of the ‘boundary-spanning’
participants appeared to exhibit a ‘learning by doing’ approach, where the process began with
involvement in a diverse set of university-industry activities well before initiating licensing or spinoff formation. Under these conditions, it is unsurprising that several of the technology transfers were
catalyzed by the availability of resources for commercialization; the awareness of the market
preceded the decision to engage in technology transfer.
Given these dynamics, it is quite likely that most serial commercializers are boundary-spanning
professors. This finding would be significant because boundary-spanning professors are known to
differ significantly from their peers in identifiable ways; by definition, they exhibit a characteristic
behaviour pattern. This suggests that this subgroup of the university population could be deliberately
targeted in the design of technology transfer support programs. In designing supports valued by this
small percentage of the university community, one would be likely to address much of the
commercialization activity within the community. Furthermore, one would be targeting the
population that is most likely to have the kind of knowledge of the industry that could contribute to
the success of any transfers.
6.4.2 Motivations for Engaging in Technology Transfer
This study also provides significant insights into the participants’ motivation for engaging in
technology transfer as well as the research that led to the technology transfer opportunities. This
section will demonstrate that it is possible to begin to make connections between established theory in
the entrepreneurship literature and the rich description provided by this theoretical study. The analysis
will focus on the reasons why it may be helpful to model faculty inventor’s motivations using need
theories of motivation.
All of the ‘needs’ theories of motivation model behaviour as a response to unsatisfied needs.
Modern need theories account for differences in the patterns of behaviour exhibited by different
individuals by positing that different individuals experience different needs to different extents.
Therefore, need theories may be able to address some of the differences between faculty members
who engage in technology transfer and those who do not. Various aspects of the participants’
behaviour and self-descriptions suggest that they may be motivated by a need for achievement.
6.4.2.1 Need for achievement
Section 0 presented evidence that the participants in this study are highly productive researchers and
capable teachers. Together with their involvement in technology transfer, these successes suggest
that this set of individuals strives for excellence across different contexts. In the ‘Outcomes’ and ‘Job
Elements and Job Satisfaction’ sub-themes, participants described business challenges they
experienced and the solving of problems as fun activities. The participants who identified the need
for a career change were clearly driven by the need to engage in new challenges. Together these
aspects of the participants’ behaviours and self-descriptions suggest that these academic entrepreneurs
may share a ‘need for achievement’ with other entrepreneurs. Need for achievement is defined as
“behaviour towards competition with a standard of excellence” by McClelland, the theory’s originator

<-----Page 121----->108
(McClelland et al., 1953; as cited in Steers & Porter, 1987, p. 60). Motivation by this need leads
individuals to pursue activities that are challenging, that require individual effort and skill, that
involve personal responsibility for outcomes and that result in feedback (Shane, 2003).
It has been robustly empirically demonstrated that this motivation leads to a higher probability that
an individual will choose to exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity and to a higher probability that
their new venture will be successful, in the case of technical as well as non-technical ventures (Shane,
2003). An exploration of this characteristic in the context of academic entrepreneurship could have
important theoretical and policy implications. Exploring a theoretical concept in a new context
permits researchers to identify any aspects of the concept that are context dependent and thus can help
them to refine the theory. This theoretical development could also have policy implications. If
academic entrepreneurs share important characteristics with non-academic entrepreneurs, it may be
possible to support both groups with the same governmental programs and thus to offer effective
programming at a lower cost. If academic entrepreneurs do not share defining characteristics with
entrepreneurs, they will need to be supported in different ways and the theoretical advances may
permit some understanding of the ways in which the programs will need to differ.

6.5 Conclusions
The participants’ behaviours identified them as ‘boundary-spanning’ researchers. Their statements in
interviews were consistent with this assessment, in that they disclosed that the participants’ attitudes
towards university-industry interaction were quite positive. Further analysis of the participants
statements suggested that these boundary-spanning behaviours provided the participants with access
to business knowledge that allowed them to ‘learn by doing,’ even before their first experiences with
licensing or venture creation. This helps to explain how the participants could achieve commercial
success, in contradiction with the position that faculty inventors lack the business knowledge required
to successfully transfer technologies.
The study also determined that faculty inventors’ motivations are significantly more complex than
their depictions in the literature to date. The participants expressed interest in achieving a wide range
of outcomes, including benefits realized by the participant’s students, colleagues, and the country’s
economy. Their involvement in technology transfer was also tied to intrinsic rewards; spin-off
creation was fun. None of these elements have been captured by previous studies.
The complexity of these motivations suggests that it may be appropriate to introduce models of
motivation from more established fields, like entrepreneurship and industrial-organizational
psychology. The discussion of the need for achievement demonstrated that the qualitative results can
be used as a bridge between the literatures. This type of work is expected to generate testable
hypotheses (e.g. academic entrepreneurs have higher levels of need for achievement than nonentrepreneurial colleagues) that are important in the substantive domain, which in this case would be
technology transfer research.
The analysis of the incentives offered by IP policies generated theories that were no less complex.
The primary incentive, among those granted by the university’s IP policy, was ownership of the IP.
The participants’ comments suggested two possible explanations for the value placed on this

<-----Page 122----->109
ownership. The first explanation is that this ownership is imbued with an emotional and cultural
significance that encourages faculty inventors to identify with their technologies and empowers them
to pursue technology transfer. The interpretation of the IP policy as an empowering message from the
university administration appears to be consistent with participant’s perception of the university
administration and the university culture, in general. The second explanation is that this cohort of
faculty inventors has little confidence in the competence of the TTSOs and therefore prizes the
freedom to work independently. This explanation hinges on the negative experiences of interactions
with the TTSOs by members of the cohort. It is possible that both explanations for the high
desirability of IP ownership are in effect at once. Contrary to the findings of quantitative work
conducted in the U.S., it wasn’t clear that financial incentives were a key determinant of technology
transfer behaviour. The extent to which financial incentives influenced participant’s decisions was
quite ambiguous, perhaps as a result of group norms that do not celebrate and can be hostile to
success in this domain.
In summary, the analysis suggested that the motivating power of the incentives offered by IP
policies is dependent on their interpretation by members of the university. These interpretations
appear to be shaped by institutional variables including organizational history, group norms,
leadership, and culture. This finding means that it isn’t possible to interpret the incentives offered by
a university’s IP policy without investigating the perceptions of those policies, which significantly
undermines the value in further cross-comparisons between universities on the basis of policy
statements.
6.5.1 Implications
The main finding of this study is that the motivating power of the incentives governed by IP appears
to be sensitive to organizational characteristics, including group norms, academic leadership and
university culture. This suggests that institutions are most likely to effectively support technology
transfer when their IP policy fits their organizational context. For example, at the University of
Waterloo, a shift to a university-ownership policy is likely undermine a culture that prizes autonomy
and places emotional significance on ownership. However, it may be possible to mitigate or remove
this effect by increasing faculty confidence in the competence of the TTLO.
Another important finding was associated with the observation that technology transfer activities
could impose high time demands. Many of the faculty members who were involved with spin-offs
and remained in the university reported that they were able to do so because they had a spouse who,
“kept the operation at home going.” This is not true for many younger professionals, which suggests
that programs and policies that allow people to temporarily reduce their university load or take leaves
of absence so that they can engage in technology transfer activities will grow in importance as a way
to sustain technology transfer activities. Universities can also consider making their boundaries more
porous to mid-career scientists, who wish to embark on a new career, by ensuring that the pension
systems do not prohibitively penalize early retirements.

<-----Page 123----->110
6.5.2 Limitations and Future Research
This study has three main limitations. Firstly, it included a small number of participants at a single
institution, which strongly limits the generalizability of the results. Secondly, it relies on
retrospective self-reports, which can be contaminated by ex-post-facto rationalizations and can be
limited by the extent to which the participants can clearly remember events that have taken place in
the past. Thirdly, the participants belonged to a single cohort. As a result, their experiences are likely
to be significantly different from other members of the University of Waterloo. An attempt was made
to identify all possible cohort effects, including the decline in the number of faculty members with a
spouse in the home, and the cultural and structural changes at the University of Waterloo over the
years, but it is possible that cohort effects were not identified or not fully explored.
Future research could address these limitations by conducting cross-comparisons between
institutions, in the style of study 1, using surveys of faculty interpretations rather than policy
statements as an independent variable in order to access faculty members’ perceptions. Given the
relationships observed between social and cultural variables and interpretations of the IP policies,
there may also be value in investigating the interactions between psycho-social organizational
variables, like the management styles at TTOs, and interpretations of university policies.

<-----Page 124----->Chapter 7
Conclusions
This chapter is structured as follows. The first section summarizes the results of the three studies
undertaken in this research. The second section responds to the research question in light of the
results of the three studies, considered together. The next section of the chapter discusses the
theoretical and policy implications of these results. The last section reviews the limitations of the
research and makes suggestions for future research directions.

7.1 Summary of Results
This research investigates the relationship between those incentives for faculty support of universityindustry technology transfer that are governed by university intellectual property policies and
technology transfer outcomes at Canadian universities. It extends the literature on this relationship by
exploring it in a new context. The context for the studies is Canada, where some universities retain
control over the development and other universities let the ownership and control vest with the
inventors.
The first study seeks to explain cross-institutional patterns in the numbers of patents held by
Canadian universities using variables that represent the financial incentives and control offered to
faculty inventors by the universities’ policies. Unlike studies conducted in the U.S., the comparisons
across institutions do not demonstrate any relationships. This may be a consequence of a difference
between the U.S. and Canada in the importance of the financial incentives for faculty support of
technology transfer as governed by IP policies. However, it is also possible that the true effects of the
IP policies are masked by the effects of other variables or by bias in the data, which failed to capture
technologies developed by university faculty members without the participation of their university.
The second study investigates the impact of a policy change at the University of Toronto, using
interrupted time series analysis techniques. This study provides the first statistical evidence that
university IP policies can be a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of institutions by
influencing university researcher’s willingness to participate in technology transfer activities. At the
University of Toronto, increasing researcher control of technology transfer by switching from a
‘university-owns’ to an ‘inventor-owns’ system appears to have stimulated higher levels of invention
disclosures. The principal limitation with this type of longitudinal model is that it is impossible to
isolate any other factors that may have determined the effect of the policy change.
The third study investigates the experiences of faculty inventors at the University of Waterloo
through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data. The first key
finding is that the faculty members who were involved in technology transfer engaged in ‘boundaryspanning’ activities, often starting well before their involvement in technology transfer activities.
These boundary-spanning activities provide a mechanism by which the participants can acquire
business knowledge. Therefore, the faculty inventors’ involvement in boundary-spanning activities
leads to a tentative explanation for the faculty inventors’ ability to manage many of the technology
111

<-----Page 125----->112
transfers successfully. The analysis also provides insight into the relationship between university
IP policies and faculty inventor behaviour. The comments by the participants suggest that the
motivating power of the incentives offered by IP policies is dependent on their interpretation by
members of the university. These interpretations appear to be shaped by institutional variables
including organizational history, group norms, leadership, and culture. For example, the desirability
of ownership of IP may derive in part from a lack of confidence in the competence of the university’s
Technology Transfer and Licensing Office. This finding means that it isn’t possible to interpret the
incentives offered by a university’s IP policy without investigating faculty members’ perceptions of
those policies. Therefore, the cross-comparison of institutions in the first study may be flawed by a
reliance on the IP policies themselves rather than faculty members’ perceptions and interpretations of
those policies.
Together the three studies suggest that university intellectual property policies are effective levers
with which to stimulate university-industry technology transfer but that the policy must fit with the
organizational context in order to be productive.

7.2 Key Findings
This research is designed to address the question: What, if any, relationship exists between university
IP policies and university-industry technology transfer? The research demonstrates a relationship
between the IP polices and technology transfer outcomes and suggests that the relationship may be
multi-faceted. Prior literature has assumed that IP policies influence faculty inventor support for
technology transfer which affects technology transfer outcomes. The findings of Studies 2 and 3 are
consistent with this type of relationship. The research also suggests that there may be other types of
relationships between the IP policies and technology transfer outcomes. University IP policies appear
to influence the TTO’s access to information. In Study 3, a technology manager observed that his
TTO did not have any reliable channels for gathering information about inventor-commercialized
university inventions. It is plausible that having limited access to information about technology
transfer activities at a university, a situation which is only expected to occur at ‘inventor-owner’
universities, probably limits the effectiveness of university support for technology transfer at that
institution. Since the effectiveness of the TTO and other university support systems is expected to
have an effect on technology transfer outcomes, this relationship deserves further research. The
research also suggests that university IP policies may influence hiring and retention. In Study 3, an
expert academic entrepreneur suggested that the University of Waterloo’s ‘inventor-owner’ policy
attracts faculty members who are especially supportive of technology transfer. This effect could help
some institutions create strongly supportive environments for technology transfer which should lead
to high levels of technology transfer activity. A relationship between IP policies and university hiring
and retention could also contribute to the development of a country’s stock of highly-qualified
personnel. Since many faculty inventors are known to be highly productive researchers, holding
desirable IP policies may also help universities attract and retain ‘star’ scientists. For both of these
reasons, the hypothesis that IP policies influence a university’s ability to hire and retain highly
productive researchers deserves to be a focus of further research.

<-----Page 126----->113

7.3 Implications
7.3.1 Theoretical Implications
As the literature review indicated, prior work has posited that IP policies influence researcher support
for technology transfer and thus affect technology transfer outcomes. Therefore, the development of a
stronger understanding of this relationship is the focus of theory development in this research.
The quantitative literature to date has tended to adopt an ‘economic agent’ model of faculty
member behaviour. Although such models can address many types of factors, the model employed in
the studies only considers financial factors. According to this interpretation of the model, the
university researcher is directly influenced by the costs and benefits of multiple courses of action.
This research contributes to a broadening of that conception. Study 2 demonstrates the significance
of research autonomy in the technology transfer process, a non-financial incentive. Study 3 explores
the motivations of faculty inventors and identifies a complex set of desires and goals that include both
extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. These findings establish the need to explore more sophisticated
models.
The subsequent analysis briefly demonstrates that it is possible to use the qualitative data to access
the more sophisticated theoretical models that have been developed in other fields. Qualitative
research can provide insight into why phenomena occur. These insights can be used to identify
theories outside of the substantive area of research that are expected to be meaningful in the context
of the substantive area. For example, this research suggests that serial commercializers exhibit higher
need for achievement than their colleagues. In other words, need for achievement, a concept from
organizational behaviour theories of motivation, is expected to be a useful way to understand faculty
inventors’ motivations in the context of future technology transfer research. This is an example of the
way in which building bridges between a substantive area of research and areas of research with
richer and more established theories makes it possible to generate testable hypotheses that are
expected to be significant in the substantive area. From this perspective, Study 3 provides a rich entry
point for the introduction of theory to technology transfer research. The third study also contributes to
theory development by identifying several factors that may determine the extent which faculty
inventors can effectively transfer their technologies. For example, it identifies the role that ‘boundaryspanning’ behaviours have with respect to the acquisition of business knowledge.
Overall, the three studies significantly broaden our understanding of the relationship between
university IP policies and university-industry technology transfer and suggest many future directions
for further theory development. It is hoped that the rich entry point for theory development, which
Study 3 presents, will yield even stronger results through future work.
7.3.2 Policy Implications
The international policy landscape currently favours the use of federal policies and legislation that
cause university IP policies to converge to a national standard. In many cases, the standard policy is
one of “university-ownership.” For example, the Canadian Expert Panel on the Commercialization of
University Research’s report called for all Canadian universities to adopt a “university-ownership”

<-----Page 127----->114
policy, citing the boom in activity in the United States after the introduction of the Bayh-Dole Act
(1999). This research suggests that this policy approach will not be productive for three reasons.
Firstly, there is no empirical evidence that a “university-owns” model is more effective or efficient
than the “researcher-owns” model. Study 2 is the only quantitative study that could be located that
demonstrates any significant difference between the two models and the “inventor-owner” model
appears to have better stimulated technology transfer at the University of Toronto. Therefore, there is
no empirical argument for convergence to “university-ownership”. Secondly, the importance of the
institutional variables identified in Study 3 suggests that policy makers must use a great deal of
caution when importing ‘best practices’ from other institutions and countries. The effectiveness of
the policies and incentives appears to be heavily dependent on achieving a fit with organizational
factors. Thirdly, convergence to any single policy would almost certainly make it more difficult for a
university to adopt a different policy in the future. University administrators would no longer be able
to introduce new policies at their institutions in order to address challenges within the system or
changes in the university environment. In effect, the university would abandon that which appears to
be a powerful lever for promoting support for technology transfer and thus reduce its ability to
innovate and respond to challenges. In Canada and in other countries, policy makers are cautioned
that any attempt to optimize at a national level is premature. As the literature indicates, the “second
revolution” and our understanding of its ramifications are still too embryonic to seek to optimize at
the expense of our flexibility to learn and adapt.
Instead of standardizing IP policies, policy makers and university administrators should consider:
1) strengthening the university TTOs; and, 2) developing university programs and policies that are
designed to meet technology transfer objectives by capitalizing on institutional strengths.
1) Studies 2 and 3 made it clear that some faculty inventors at both the University of Toronto
and the University of Waterloo viewed the technology transfer support as inadequate.
Individuals at both universities suggested that the offices were under-funded and understaffed. At the University of Toronto, negative perceptions of the Innovations Foundation
appeared to discourage the disclosure of inventions in the years prior to the policy change. At
the University of Waterloo, negative perceptions of the technology transfer office
discouraged faculty inventors from seeking support. This implies that universities and
governments can improve technology transfer outcomes by providing more resources to
technology transfer offices. Since faculty inventor behaviours hinged on confidence in the
competence of the offices, these behaviour patterns may be slow to change. Therefore,
investments in TTO staffing and provision of funding for core functions, like patent
protection, should be, at a minimum, multi-year commitments. With respect to the delivery of
core services, only long-term funding can be expected to enable the TTOs to develop stronger
relationships within the university and the community.
2) Policy makers can also work towards both technology transfer objectives and the
development of appropriate support programs and polices by structuring additional support
for technology transfer in the form of funding competitions. Technology transfer is associated
with a variety of objectives. The development of specific funding streams would allow
policy-makers to target high priorities within these objectives (e.g. the creation of new
economy jobs). These competitions would provide funds for the development and support of

<-----Page 128----->115
programs and policies that address a given objective and still create the flexibility
necessary for innovation by allowing the universities to meet the objective in different ways.
University programs should be selected based on the feasibility of the program design and the
extent to which they capitalize on the university’s strengths and opportunities. For example,
a research-intensive university with strengths in less appropriable technologies could focus on
spin-off creation, a research-intensive university with strengths in highly-appropriable
technologies could focus on licensing to small- and medium-sized enterprises, and a less
research-intensive university could develop programs in support of student entrepreneurship.
In summary, the current trend towards standardization of IP policies is not expected to yield optimal
results. Instead, policy makers and university administrators are advised to focus on strengthening
TTOs and programs and policies that both address technology transfer objectives and fit the
universities’ strengths and opportunities.

7.4 Limitations and Future Research Directions
The principal limitation of the research is the lack of generalizability. The research design assumes
that the cross-sectional study will be able to provide generalizable results and that the longitudinal
and qualitative studies will refine the understanding achieved through that cross-sectional study.
Since Study 1 does not identify any statistically significant results, the assertion that IP polices appear
to be important in the context of university-industry technology transfer rests entirely on findings at
two research-intensive universities. Therefore, the focus of future research will be on broadening this
investigation, which can be achieved in a number of ways.
One approach to broadening the quantitative work presented in this dissertation would be revisiting
the cross-sectional design. Future studies could take into account the interaction between faculty
inventors’ interpretations of the incentives determined by IP policies and other institutional variables,
including the management style of the technology transfer office. The chief concern with respect to
this work would be finding technology transfer outcomes that are not biased towards ‘universityownership’. This measure is sufficiently important to conducting quality work in technology transfer
that the development of a ‘spin-off’ and ‘licensing’ database would be a worth-while investment.
The qualitative work presented in this thesis can also be extended. One promising avenue for this
future work would be to conduct interview studies on research motivation at a wider range of
universities, including universities that currently have ‘university-owner’ policies. This qualitative
work is expected to yield many insights into the research question, especially the ways in which
faculty inventors’ perceptions of incentives are influenced by their universities’ IP policies, and
technology transfer in general.
Last but not least, this research can be extended by continuing to explore technology transfer in
Canada and a variety of other national systems of innovation. This research provided novel insights
into technology transfer by extending the research from the United States to Canada. Further work in
outside the U.S. is expected to identify those theories that are most robust and the factors that
determine whether or not policies and programs that appear effective in one context will be
productive in another context. This work is imperative for interpreting academic results such that they

<-----Page 129----->116
can support effective policy making. The need for this type of future research implies a final
policy direction: The need for governments to support research into technology transfer at
universities and in institutions other than high-profile U.S. universities, and, more broadly,
management of technology research in a variety of economies. The importance of institutional factors
in this research is an example of the need for local solutions to policy questions, and the need for
local solutions will be best met by the development of local research capacity.

<-----Page 130----->Appendix A
Canadian University Intellectual Property Policies as of 1999
The following measures were used to represent each policy:
Right of First Offer: This measure was used to evaluate the control that the policies provide to
researchers. When the policies were evaluated, a ‘1’ was recorded if the university reserves the right
of first offer and a ‘0’ was recorded if the university does not reserve the right of first offer.
Share of Revenues When University Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
provided to the researcher, when the university commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
Share of Revenues When Inventor Commercializes Invention: The percentage of net income
retained by the researcher, when the researcher commercializes the innovation, was recorded.
There were three circumstances where it is not possible to record a single percentage for the
researchers’ share of revenues. If the percentage provided to the researcher is not specified in advance
but negotiated on a case-by-base basis, the word ‘Negotiated’ is recorded. If the university does not
support technology transfer activities by developing IP, ‘Not Applicable’ is recorded. If the revenue
sharing agreement is structured using thresholds, above which the researcher’s share of the revenue
changes, ‘Threshold’ was recorded.
The data for all of the policies included in the study are presented in the following table.

Detailed Results of Statistical Analyses for Study 2
This appendix contains the details of the statistical analyses of the impact of the policy intervention
on the University of Toronto invention disclosure time series. Unless stated otherwise, all of the
analysis was conducted using SPSS, version 13.0. The first section describes the regression
diagnostics applied to each of the five regression models of the policy intervention. The next five
sections describe the five models. The last two sections discuss ARIMA modeling of the intervention
and non-parametric tests of the intervention respectively.

Regression Diagnostics
The regression analysis of the five models of the policy intervention includes diagnostic checking of
the assumptions underlying regression analysis. After each regression model is used to estimate
model parameters, the model must be subject to diagnostic checking, which ensures that the errors, or
the differences between the values predicted by the model and the actual values, do not violate any of
these assumptions. The key assumptions and methods used in diagnostic checking of these
assumptions are outlined in Table 19.

Model 1
This model, specified in Equation 1, assumes that the policy intervention had no impact on the
number of invention disclosures made per fiscal year.
Estimation of the model parameters yields three important tables of data that summarize the model:
Table 20: Coefficients of Determination for Model 1, Table 21: Sum of Squared Errors for Model 1,
and Table 22: Parameter Estimates for Model 1.

The coefficient of determination indicates that the model accounts for 83.5% of the variance in the
number of invention disclosures reported annually and the adjusted coefficient of determination
indicates that the model’s fit is still good when the degrees of freedom are taken into consideration.
The F-test of the model was significant at the 0.01 level which also suggests that the fit of the model
is very good indeed. However, the model fit can not be properly interpreted until the diagnostic
checking is complete. The regression diagnostics for Model 1 are summarized in Table 23.

•

Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation of
the residuals indicated that first-order
autocorrelation is present:
d=0.581<dL(2,29,.05)=1.34 (Chatterjee et
al., 2000)

Yes

•

The presence of autocorrelation suggests
that the relationship between time and the
annual counts of invention disclosures is
not adequately captured by the model

•

The scatter plot of standardized residuals
versus fiscal year end, in Figure 11,
shows a pattern in the residuals across the
fiscal years prior to the IP intervention

•

This pattern suggests that the violations
probably stem from having the model fit
the first half of the data series less well
than the latter half

Model 1 violates two of the three assumptions. This is unsurprising given that the premise of the
analysis is that this baseline model will not fit the data as well as a model that considers the impact of
the policy intervention. Typically the main concern when regression models exhibit autocorrelation is
the effect on the tests of the significance of the fit of the model and of the significance of the
parameters. Autocorrelation tends to result in underestimates of the errors and thus spuriously inflates
the tests of significance. Since the model in question is the baseline, against which the models of the
policy intervention will be compared, any spurious inflation of the measures of the model’s fit will
result in a more conservative test of the impact of the policy intervention provided that the other
models do not exhibit more violations or more extreme violations of the key assumptions. Therefore,
the baseline model will be used as a point of comparison of the fit of each model of the impact of the

<-----Page 137----->124
policy intervention and the extent to which these models do or do not violate the assumptions
underlying regression analysis.

The coefficient of determination, given in Table 24, indicates that the model accounts for
91.7% of the variance in the number of invention disclosures reported annually. The adjusted
coefficients of determination indicates that the second model’s fit is still better than Model 1 when the
degrees of freedom are taken into consideration (R2=0.911, R2=0.829 for models 1 and 2
respectively). The F-test of the model was significant at the 0.01 level which also suggests that the fit

The second model has only one violation, compared to the two violations observed with the first
model. Therefore, comparing the two models on the basis of fit is a reasonable next step. The increase
in the adjusted squared multiple correlation terms from the first model (R2=0.829) to the second
model (R2=0.911) suggests that the second model has more explanatory power than the first model,
even taking into account the larger number of parameters in the second model. Since Model 1 can be
obtained as a special case of Model 2, an F-test can be used to determine if the increase in
explanatory power is significant (Chatterjee et al., 2000). Chatterjee refers to the model with fewer
parameters as the Reduced Model (RM) and the other model as the Full Model (FM), and summarizes
the test’s hypotheses as, “H0: Reduced Model is adequate”, “H1: Full Model is adequate” (Chatterjee
et al., 2000, p. 63). The F-statistic is calculated using Equation 3.

The F-test is significant at the .05 level, F= 25.6 > F(1, 27,.05) = 4.21 (Hill & Lewicki, 2005).
Therefore, Model 2 fits the time series significantly better than Model 1.

Model 3
This model, specified in Equation 4, assumes that the policy intervention did not have an immediate
impact on the number of invention disclosures per year but it did have an impact on the rate at which
the number of invention disclosures changed from year to year. Estimation of the model parameters
yields three important tables of data that summarize the model: Table 28: Coefficients of
Determination for Model 3, Table 29: Sum of Squared Errors for Model 3, and Table 30: Parameter
Estimates for Model 3.
The coefficient of determination, given in Table 28, indicates that the model accounts for 91.5% of
the variance in the number of invention disclosures reported annually The adjusted coefficients of
determination indicates that the third model’s fit is still better than Model 1 when the degrees of
freedom are taken into consideration (R2=0.829, R2=0.908 for models 1 and 2 respectively). The Ftest of the model was significant at the 0.01 level which also suggests that the fit of the model is very
good. However, the model fit can not be properly interpreted until the diagnostic checking is

This model, specified in Equation 5, assumes that the policy intervention had both an immediate
impact on the number of invention disclosures per year and an impact on the rate at which the number
of invention disclosures changed from year to year.
The coefficient of determination indicates that the fourth model accounts for 96.6% of the variance
in the number of invention disclosures reported annually. Comparing adjusted coefficients of
determination shows that Model 4’s fit (R2=0.961) is better than Model 1’s fit (R2=0.829), even when
the model’s different degrees of freedom are taken into consideration. The F-test of the model and the
t-tests of all of the parameters were significant at the 0.01 level which also suggests that the fit of the

The fourth model has no violations, compared to the two violations observed with the first model.
Therefore, comparing the two models on the basis of fit is a reasonable next step. The F-test is

The only indication that the model does not appropriately model the data is given in

<-----Page 147----->134

Variance of the residuals before and after

definitely not a concern (Chatterjee et al.,
2000)

No

Independence of each other

Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation
indicated that first-order autocorrelation is
not present: d=1.84 < dU(2,29,.05)=1.56
(Chatterjee et al., 2000)

No

The scatter plot, Figure 15, does not
appear to have any trends

The absence of autocorrelation suggests
that this model that has adequately
captured the trends in the time series of
invention disclosures

The fifth model has no violations, compared to the two violations observed with the first model.
This means that Model 5 can be compared against Model 1. The F-test is significant at the .05 level,
F= 91.8 > F(2,26,.01) = 5.53 (Hill & Lewicki, 2005). This is strong evidence that Model 5 fits the
time series significantly better than Model 1, which supports the hypothesis that the policy
intervention had an effect on the number of invention disclosures reported annually.
The absence of any violations of the assumptions underlying regression analysis also means that
the tests of significance of Model 5 and its parameters are valid. These tests were all significant at the
.01 level, as shown in Table 37 and Table 38, which is strong evidence that the model fits the data
very well. Therefore, the parameter estimates for this model are meaningful. These parameter
estimates indicate that prior to the policy intervention there were 22.2 ± 4.7 inventions disclosed per
year. Immediately after the intervention, the number of disclosures increased by 49.0 ± 12.2 and
continued increasing from year to year by 5.9 ± 1.4 disclosures per year. There is no question that
these effects are substantial when compared to the pre-intervention disclosure rates. Therefore, the
policy intervention had a significant and substantial effect.

Reviewing the Need for Transformations of the Data
In the Exploratory Analysis, the data were visually inspected and it was determined that
transformations of the data were unnecessary. This section reviews that decision by assessing whether
or not a Box-Cox transformation would have yielded substantially better fit.
The Box-Cox transformation for a positively-valued time series is given in Equation 7. Note that
the transformation has no effect on the series when = 1. To assess the impact that a Box-Cox
transformation would have on Model 5’s fit, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was calculated
for values of ranging from -3 to 3 using SPSS syntax made available by York University (2005). As
shown in Figure 16: Box-Cox Transformation Results, the RMSE is minimized at 8.95 when =
0.80. This minimum is only 2% smaller than the RMSE generated by fitting the untransformed
values (9.16). Therefore, the Box-Cox transformation does not create sufficient advantage to be
worthwhile in this case.

ARIMA Modeling
ARIMA models were not the first choice when investigating the interrupted time series because the
use of an ARIMA model typically requires at least 50 observations and the time series of interest
contains only 29 observations (Montgomery & Johnson, 1976). To verify that ARIMA models could
not be usefully applied to the time series, SPSS DecisionTime, version 1.1, was used to investigate
the time series. This program allows the user to specify interventions and then it will automatically
search out the most significant ARIMA model. This tool was used to quickly assess whether or not
ARIMA modeling of the intervention would be fruitful. Testing of the simple intervention model
showed that significant ARIMA models of the intervention are not achievable.

Non-Parametric Tests for Trend Detection
Non-parametric tests, or tests that do not assume that the data of interest have a specific distribution,
can be used to test for the existence of trends within the data. In this case, the Mann-Kendall trend test
for non-seasonal data was used to confirm the existence of a significant change in slope when the
policy intervention went into effect. This test, specified by Equation 8, determines whether or not a
time series has a statistically significant monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing trend.
The test was coded in SPSS syntax because it is not available as part of the standard functions for
version 13.0. The syntax is included in Appendix C. The test was applied to separately to the time
series before and after the policy intervention. The series before the policy intervention has a positive
trend but it is not significant at the .05 level (S=31, p=.0876). The series after the policy intervention
was found to have a positive trend that was significant at the .05 level (S=55, p=.0004). This confirms
the significance of the change in level immediately after the policy intervention.

Vignettes from Study 3: Qualitative Investigation of Faculty
Inventors’ Experiences
This appendix contains vignettes from interviews in Study 3, the qualitative investigation of faculty
inventors’ experiences. The participants had been University of Waterloo faculty members prior to
the interviews or were senior University of Waterloo faculty members at the time of the interviews
and all of the participants had had experience with university-industry interactions. In order to
broadly investigate the faculty inventor’s experiences, participants were selected who had engaged in
patenting and licensing, spin-off company creation, doing contract work for industry, and who had
moved back and forth between industry and academe. Some of these activities were successful from
the participant’s perspective and some were not. The vignettes were constructed to convey a rich
picture of these individual perspectives on these experiences and related issues.
The vignettes are organized thematically using the following five over-arching themes: 1)
university-industry activities; 2) university environment; 3) rewards and reward systems; 4) attitudes;
and, 5) career decisions.

Theme 1: University-Industry Activities
This theme explores attributes of the technology transfer activities and other university-industry
interactions in which the participants were involved. This top-level theme is further divided into six
themes: 1) opportunity recognition & catalysts for technology transfer; 2) participants’ roles in
technology transfer activities & relationships with spin-off firms; 3) time demands; 4) learning and
identification of mistakes; 5) success factors; and, 6) outcomes.
Opportunity Recognition & Catalysts for Technology Transfer
There was a lot of technology that I ended up developing: in research papers and also in the filing
cabinet. I saw that there was a lot of technology and I started thinking, ‘What happens now? How do I
get it into practice.’ I offered it to companies but they did a marketing study and the volume of the
business was too small. So then I ended up considering, ‘What do I do with this?’ I met a guy with a
technology transfer support organization and I told him that I had tried to transfer this technology and
the companies were not interested. He said, ‘Look, I could find you some venture capitalists’ and he
did.

[I knew there was a market for the technology because] being a technical person, I go to conferences,
I go to trade shows and so on. I see which direction the technology is going and which direction the
markets are going. But the answer to your question is I didn’t know. My gut instinct was telling me
that it would be important to this industry because then they can have a faster manufacturing line.
That doesn’t take an Einstein to figure out.

<-----Page 155----->142

Some people in the research group decided that they had enough of working within the university.
They wanted to go out and try new things; they were all going to go out and get big jobs. We
recognized that these people were very bright and they had a bit of an entrepreneurial bent to them, so
we suggested we would finance a company, set them up in business. We passed around a hat and
that’s exactly what happened. Nothing actually left the university in terms of intellectual property.
The company went off and developed the technology independently of us, except, obviously they had
all this knowledge. Also, they had the knowledge in our group that that they could tap into. It was a
cooperative venture; we did some things, they did some things. The groups gradually diverged but
we were still working together on various projects.

I never planned any of it. I mean it happened to me, in the sense that I worked with really interesting
people. I worked with one colleague in particular and he had these ideas, which were pretty exciting
at the time. I don’t claim that I did anything in one sense; what I did was follow these other guys.
What they were doing was exciting and my talents helped them a little bit so it went well.

With one of the major issues in my research area, we all know that it causes many problems but how
you treat that in an applied science sense is not always so clear. There’re all kinds of specific
research problems and issues that arise out of it and you have to determine which ones you’re going
to attack, which ones should be the highest priority. One of the things we did a lot of in those days,
we had a good set of contacts, some relatively formal groups and some more informal, with whom we
would thrash out this problem. We would try to come to a resolution by saying, ‘Okay, this is by far
the highest priority. We’ll work on that problem, provided we can find someone to support us,
provided we can find good graduate students, and undergraduates to work on it.’ We had a large
number of projects right from the early days on through to now. I think one of the key issues here is,
not only, being able to identify those problems, prioritize them, having a plan of attack for them, but
also having some kind of a perception of what the problems will be in the future. As a researcher,
you want to be on the front end of the wave, not the back end of the wave. And, in our field,
economics of what we do are critical to developing the technologies.

The catalyst for the start-up was a business person familiar with the industry. He approached our
research group and said ‘Why don’t we start up a company?’ We very naively said ‘Okay, let’s go
ahead and form a company.’ We went out and tried to get contracts. Like many start-up companies,
you have a business plan, a potential set of clients and we did marketing. In fact we got our first
contract, when I met an old buddy who I’d worked with years and years ago, a chance encounter and
he said, ‘Well, what are you guys doing here?’ and we said ‘We started up a new business, we’re
trying to get some work.’ And he said ‘I’ve got a project. I need some design work done.’ So we
said ‘okay’ and that was our first contract. It wasn’t big, and it was a happenstance thing. So
sometimes in marketing you can have a very deliberate marketing program, but launched our small
company. We kept getting contracts, a number of small contracts and then larger contracts.

<-----Page 156----->143

After struggling for the first five years, we wanted to think it was time to quit. That missionary
period: having to go through that, still not seeing the real developments until that period was over. It’s
the length of the thing that’s frustrating. Trying to get the financing is very difficult and things don’t
always, not necessarily financially, but other things don’t progress as you expect them to. It gets very
frustrating at times and you just have to see it through. You have to make sure that there’s, well I
don’t know how you do this, but you hopefully have some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. What
got us through was faith in the product, faith in what we were doing. We knew, having looked at the
market, that there was a need.

We decided that the project was too important not to get involved in. We didn’t know whether there
would be any interesting research in it but we were pretty sure we could contribute to it whether it
was just a straight development effort or what. As we started working on the problem, we found that
it wasn’t merely an application of existing technologies; it really needed new technology to be
developed. During the project, as we were developing new ideas and implementing new ideas, we
were also exposed, through conferences and through visitors, to people who wanted to use the
technology.

The tools we had developed seemed like the basis of a company or of a business plan. And so a few
colleagues and technical staff members and I together decided that we would form such a company.
We talked to the other people who were involved in the project and everybody agreed that this would
be a good thing but only a few of us became the principals; putting together the company with only
private investment. The investors were all people who were involved in the project. The idea was
that the company could be the commercial outlet for these tools. We didn’t want to just to be a
distributor of technology developed in the university, so the idea right away when we set up the
company was that it was going to have its own development staff as well. It would start with our
tools but it would develop them further as they needed more tools, do what ever they wanted. So they
were going to have their full-time development staff, not necessarily research. We would continue to
do research and the idea was that we would complement each other. Research that was done in the
university could be transferred to the company; improvements that the company made would come
back to the university so the research group would deal with the most recent versions, to go forward.
That was the principle, with which the company was formed

I had a student take on an applied project and found that the theory needed to be advanced to solve
the problem. The thesis was a very successful thesis. And the problem then was to get it published. I
wasn’t thinking of anything commercial yet. I was in my normal mode, get the student through the
thesis and crack the whip and get something published. But where do you get something published
like that? The application-area journals rejected every paper because they didn’t understand it. We
finally got it published in one journal. I don't know what kind of review it got. I don't think there was

<-----Page 157----->144
anybody who could review it very well. At that point in time we decided, I guess because of the
fact that the solution worked, that it might be worth patenting.
Participants’ Roles in Technology Transfer Activities & Relationships with Spin-Off
Firms
When we set up the one spin-off, I was a faculty member. I’m allowed one day of consulting a week.
Ok. How do I use that? Well, I use my consulting by helping to run the spin-off. For instance, we
ran courses for them. We were teaching the users. We would run those courses; all of us would
contribute and give lectures. I used to visit a major user site once a month and talk about this stuff to
a class of people. That was my contribution. I didn’t get paid for it, except travel expenses. In the
other spin-off, I spent time developing new ideas, new ways of doing things with their technologies. I
wasn’t the only one; I’m just giving you an example of how different people contributed. Everybody
chipped in, in various ways. Some people got paid, some people didn’t. For example, I had a fulltime job at the university and so I was very well paid there. Other people, their full time job was at
the spin-off and they got paid there, so they might get paid to give a lecture. The idea was we were
building something that was a legacy for all of us.

I served as a tie to the university, as a technical representative. After several years, the company was
really on its own in the business sense. It had a lot of internal technical expertise. There was a lot of
interest in ties with other corporations and it didn’t need its close ties with the University of Waterloo,
in the same way. It went off on its own. Over the years, I have been an occasional consultant to the
spin-off and I’ve got a very good relationship with lead technical staff at the spin-off. In fact we have
just now started a new contract funded by government to do some research where the spin-off is the
corporate partner. We’ve maintained a good relationship.

My personal view on how the company grows and my relationship to it [as a founder who remained
in the university]? I never felt proprietary ownership of the company. I never felt that I needed to be
in control of the company, which I think was healthy for me. I view the company’s growth a lot like
raising a child: starting very small and nurturing it, playing an advisory role with it as it gets a little
older, being cut off completely for a couple of years because the company thinks it can do a lot better
without you, and then slowly recognizing where you can contribute and you come back in to play and
the relationship gets re-established on good terms. And that’s sort of very much the way that my
work with the company has worked. And it’s been fine with me. I mean I think that if I wasn’t going
to give up my university position then the company’s not going succeed if it’s going to depend on the
university to sustain it or to depend on me to sustain it. Furthermore, the company should choose its
partners based on what’s good for the company. So when the company feels that the university has
something to offer it should work the company and when the company feels the university has
nothing to offer or a different university has something better to offer, or something. If it’s going to
grow it should feel free to do those things. I was happy to let it. Other entrepreneurs that I know are
much less willing to give up what they started.

<-----Page 158----->145

[My role was] giving guidance and advice, and high-level marketing in the sense of making
presentations with large-scale proposals or projects. Because of my involvement in research and
professional practice issues, I had a higher profile than the university members who left to join the
university had, so I made presentations, I gave seminars. I did really long-range marketing, plus
technical guidance too, because I have a large role in the development of much of the technology that
the company markets.

Any organization, once it’s set up, takes on a life of its own. It goes in its own direction. You can only
influence that to a certain extent because things are differently because they’re in a different space
than you are. They diverged, there’s no doubt about that. Even when we owned them, they were
diverging because they had to. Having said all that, a number of us still have very close relationships
with the company. Some of the senior management used to work with me, so we’ve known each
other a long time. The other aspect of this is that I go and try ideas on them periodically and say,
“Hey, what about this?” They do support our research, sometimes providing tools and sometimes
cash and sometimes decision making. I often talk to the people at the spin-off in support of our work
in past. Whether they will want to in future, I don’t know. We’ll see what we’re doing.

We gave a series of lectures on campus. They were one or two day seminars to which we’d invite
local industries. A lot of their people would come. We would talk to them about our technology and
what it would do and an overview of the field and they would in turn tell us things that they were
doing. We got feedback … you have to know what products people want; see what they liked, what
they didn’t like. The contacts and the networking are very important.

The technology that we developed was very broadly applicable. When somebody in computer science
or engineering solves a problem they typically solve the more general problem then the specific one.
It’s not just the one problem that you’re trying to solve but rather you solve the more general one.
That was recognized early on. As soon as we started developing the tools, we recognized that it was
going to be applicable in a number of industries. The disappointing thing was that whenever
somebody came along for a demo to see what we were doing, we would tell them about the project,
show them what we could do and try to explain how it could be used. They all said, ‘this is very
exciting but it doesn’t apply to us.’ People just could not see the applications. The spin-off struggled
for the longest time. The biggest struggle was trying to find ways to show that the technology was
applicable more broadly. One of the first things we did was develop demonstrations of some of the
uses. We did some other things, within the university, to show that we could do it but also because
the company needed it. They needed things that they could take on the road. If they were going to
industry A, they had to show examples from industry A, and if they were going to industry B, they
had to show examples from industry B because people can’t translate from some other application to
their needs.

<-----Page 159----->146
At first potential users do not understand what the invention is all about. They don’t understand
the need. So, there’s a bit of missionary work to be done: Why pick this particular technology versus
another and that makes us better for techies then for high level people, but then high level people
don’t listen to techies. That’s what our experience has been. I’d say there were maybe three or four
years where we were doing missionary work. Where we were going out and talking to executives,
getting them to take the time to get the ideas through without going into the very heavy technical side.
It’s not that they can’t understand it’s just that they’re busy with other things but there’s an
intermediate stage which has to be achieved, I think. They have to know enough about the
technology: what it will do and what it is from the point of view of what they’re going to have to
invest in it. Then they understand it and then they can appreciate it and promote it. But there is
missionary work especially in this area that had to be done.

I’m not quite entrepreneurial in the same sense that some other people are because I don’t have the
business interests in working with the company and getting it going. I thought it was a good thing. I
was definitely interested in seeing it happen but I was not the one to figure out how to make a
company work and I was not about to give up my job here in order to get into the company, either.
So, it was definitely a little more remote a relationship with the company. Some of my colleagues
really invested their time in the company and took ownership of it, had very much of a personal
interest in making the company work.
Time Demands
One of the biggest challenges is being able to manage your time. I’m very conscious about that. I was
getting paid by the university; that was my primary job, so I had to put in the time required to do my
job at the university. In other words you can’t sacrifice university time for the start-up. What I did in
the company was really extra time, quite often early morning work from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. or evenings,
a lot of evenings, weekends and stuff like that. You find the few hours that you don’t have to be at the
university, as a faculty member and a university administrator. Also, your research projects that need
attention here at the university, and your students that need attention. So, you have to be pretty
careful in how you manage your hours.

I attended meetings regarding proposals on projects. We wrote a lot of proposals, spent a lot of time
working on proposals because that’s the way you’re going to get a good majority of your contracts.
They aren’t going to walk in the door. You have to write proposals and they have to be well written,
they have to be directed to the client’s problems. Sometimes these would be unsolicited proposals,
other times they would be in response to a request for proposals and you work them both. Cost
estimating on these things is absolutely critical, because you’re not there to lose money. So I worked
a lot on proposals and made presentations. I spent a lot of long hours, night hours, weekend hours and
so on.

<-----Page 160----->147
Probably a couple of days a month is right, [as an estimate of the amount of time I spent working
on the spin-off as a founder who remained in the university]. I think I went to the spin-off once a
week, for technical meetings; that would be once a week for a couple of hours. It was like consulting:
you’re hoping that you get some insights into your research or teaching. I was being compensated for
it, I think… Even if I wasn’t getting a consulting fee I was certainly earning money by putting time
into the company because I owned a share of it. I think it is like doing consulting for any other
company. It has to be balanced with everything else and you have to get good things out of it. I was
interested in the research area; there were definitely research challenges. It’s a consulting opportunity
like other consulting opportunities but with a company that actually cares or, at least, that’s going to
listen to what you’re saying and that was very good.

I could say that the university should allow you time to develop these ideas [to encourage technology
transfer] but, I think, that if you feel strongly about the idea then you will find the time. I actually kept
track of my time. And I made sure that I spent forty hours a week at the university, at the university
work. I did a lot of traveling so that meant weekends and evenings and things. But I made sure that I
didn’t feel like I was ripping the university off. And still it can be done. I worked forty hours a week
at the university; I had a huge number of graduate students. I worked for the company probably
twenty to thirty, sometimes forty extra hours a week. So it was a fairly tiring time. It was hard
physically, it was hard mentally.
Learning and the Identification of Mistakes
I think I was a little bit of elitist, at the beginning. That ended up hurting me. I was looking down on
understanding the law. Later on, when I was hit hard, then I said, “Oh! You have to understand the
laws, you have to understand how it works,” because it can be legal and it can be very unfair. But it
was too late, you see? So that was a mistake I made. Now when I enter into agreements with respect
to the business, I look at the legal aspect. In other words, I say, “Ok, suppose the worst scenario
happens here, what are effects on the company, what are the effects on the individuals?” because the
other person will not operate fairly.

There seem to be two kinds of businesses in the technology world. In one kind of business is you’ve
got a good idea and now you have to figure out who would ever want to buy it and why. So you have
to create a market place. That’s hard. The other idea is they absolutely need this product because if
they don’t have it, their business will be destroyed. The spin-off was really constructed on,
amazingly enough, not satisfying a need but creating superior products that we hoped would sell in
the market place. But we did sell them at the market place. Some of the stuff is best of breed in it’s
particular niche. The spin-off was acquiring large customers, who could see the value of what we
were proposing. We were getting to the point where we were creating a market place for the product
because enough people were saying, “Hey, this is good stuff, and we can see that it would help us do
our business better.”

<-----Page 161----->148
The way I look at it is that you have to learn from your mistakes and not make the same mistake
the second time. I was lucky because I had multiple chances at setting up companies. The first one
started, lasted for a couple of years, didn’t do anything and died. I learned from that one that it’s
important to choose your partners correctly but nothing much came of that. In a later spin-off, I was
learning how to set up a company and doing all that on the side as well as working at the university.
All the things we were doing in the lab were quite exciting because we were able to get patents on
them. In those days, people in my field were not patenting, it was not considered important to patent
stuff. It was sort of fun because I started to realize that it was pretty important. If you’re going to
commercialize something, patents are pretty important things. That was fun. Looking back on past
experiences, there were lots of mistakes I made. I don’t think I’ve made any of the same mistakes in
this spin-off. I’ve made some others, maybe, but at least I learned enough not to make the same
mistakes again. That’s part of the fun, I guess. Anyway, I’ve enjoyed it.

I made mistakes. I didn’t really pay attention or have a good understanding of agreements I entered
into. Later on, when I realized what it meant … it was terrible what I had signed and it came back to
haunt me. I signed an agreement with no out, the investors were controlling everything. I lost the
ability to develop the company the way I wanted to develop it. It led to a lot of issues, especially
when the company started to be profitable. They wanted to dip into that money but I wanted that
money to put it back into the business. It was painful. The mistake I made is that I didn’t really
understand the investment process. Instead of trying to understand it before I got into it, I assumed
that if it’s legal, it’s also fair. So I learned that one the hard way.

If I had to do it again, one of the things I would certainly consider, is moving the company into the
U.S. in a much earlier stage so that it would have access to the grants that are available in the United
States for company development. There’s nothing in Canada that matches. IRAP grants are small
and, at best, do forty percent of the total cost of the project. Whereas, in the U.S., you can get SBIR
grants that are up to seven hundred and fifty thousand U.S. each and there’s no matching funds
required and you can have two of those going at the same time. That would change the whole
structure of a new high tech company.

I never thought about the market when I started. I just thought, I’m out to design a better mousetrap
than ever was before. The failure was because of not understanding the market and how the market
works: the industry managers and their mindsets. A newspaper did a write-up of the concept, and
from the response we knew that end-users were interested. The mindset of the managers was the
reason for the barrier there... If there’s anyway you could test the market earlier on, I’d do it.

I discovered that this product had to be picked up by one of the existing companies to be successful. It
is a difficult market, there’s not doubt about it: very niche, very narrow market and established. The
number of manufacturers in the market hasn’t been going up. Each one is fighting each other for his
share of the market whatever it is and it’s a decreasing market.

<-----Page 162----->149

The springboard for establishing our initial company was some of the research that my students had
been doing, and work that I had done. We had some things that we could go out and sell. Of course,
once you get contracts to do this, then you learn a lot more; you develop better technology and so it’s
an ongoing process. If you don’t do that you’re going to be taken over by the competition real fast.

Industrial research groups are not as open to new ideas as they might be. They have their own
proprietary stock and they don’t want that disturbed. So it was hard in a lot of cases to break through.
They would listen to a company but not to new researchers who were intruding on their turf already.
Even if you got through with some of those technical groups, their management wasn’t with them.
You don’t go to technical people because you’re wasting your time. We learned it the hard way. We
did that lots and lots. It shouldn’t have to be this way but you have to go around and go to the top
over technical people’s heads. Get their people interested, they could say to a research group, ‘OK,
now you look at this.’ Then it works. But if you just go to the research group, believe me it doesn’t
work.
Success Factors
I knew the Canadian representative for one of the largest companies in the industry. I had worked
with him on a project for two years before he went to work with them so I approached him to take this
design back to the company and ask, "Is it of interest to you? Do you want to license it?" They came
back very arrogantly and said, "If it wasn't designed in-house, it's not worth looking at." According to
him, those were the words that came back to him, "We're not interested in anything else."

We had hired an outside president for the company. I was still full-time at the university in those
days. We hired an outside president and he expanded the company to meet a sales forecast that never
came to be. We almost went bankrupt, this was after he was gone of course but nevertheless we were
able to pull through that and turn it into a profitable company again.

The spin-off company rented space from my department and they were pretty good about it. There
was at least once where we were substantially behind in our rent because we had no money. They just
kept sending a bill and adding the months and you know sending another bill and adding a month. Of
course, when we did get some money we paid them off. But they were pretty good about it. I didn’t
feel any pressure at all.

Being plugged into what others do is extremely valuable to any researcher. In fact, sometimes I think
we don’t realize how valuable it is to have these contacts, to know what is going on in many other
countries. If you have contacts, it saves you an inordinate amount of time. And it’s not just saving
time. Quite often, if you have these contacts, you can send somebody an e-mail and say, ‘Hey Joe,

<-----Page 163----->150
can you tell me who’s done this or who’s done that on problem X?’ When I really sit and think
about it, my career has benefited immensely by having all these different contacts. Not just the
graduate students that I’ve had, but also people that I’ve met and worked with in different countries.
In other words, it’s a leveraging and reinforcing mechanism.
[Publications have helped me develop contacts] hundreds of times and it also leads to recruitment
of students. It is a factor in students becoming aware of your work, from Canada or other countries.
It leads to agencies wanting you to look at some research problems. If they are aware of you and your
work, then certainly they’re going to come to you. I’ve had all kinds of examples over my career
where people say ‘Would you look at this?’ I’ve seen an enormous number of different problems that
have come from, not even just within Canada, but abroad.

The aspect of my background that made it easier for me to help with the business was my experience
giving estimates for research and consulting projects. When you do an estimate on a research project
or contract research, it just strikes you that this is a three hundred thousand dollar project. Literally
within minutes you kind of make that kind of rough estimate. Then, when you do the detailed
pricing, if you’re way off that, you have to ask yourself why. It’s kind of a test of reasonableness, in
the sense that when you price things out in detail, you should come out with what your gut feeling
was to start with. Experience teaches you, I think, that you should have a kind of a gut feeling for the
scope of the project, not just the work to be done but also what it should be costing.

I’ve never consciously thought of myself as an entrepreneur but when I look back at the things I have
done in the private sector and in the academic sector and so on, I guess I have been an entrepreneur. I
haven’t been an academic that hunkers down and works in depth on a particular problem. I’ve worked
on a very large number of problems, ranging from a hard-core experimental type of work to very softsided work that is more economics and socially-oriented. I like working on specific technical
problems but I also like to cover a very wide range of problems and interests. I have a large amount of
interest in what goes on, politically, economically, socially and so on not that I have any great ability
to participate in that. I try to keep aware of what’s going on in the financial world and other things
like that and I think that’s helped me in trying to understand the impacts and the relevance of a large
amount of things that I do in research.

The other thing that’s important here is that the co-founders of the company, we knew each other
well. We had a similar philosophy on how the business should be run. My cofounders are very good
in our field and I think we also had a kind of an unwritten understanding that we would try to make
sure that we had a consensus on our decisions, not that we ever wrote that down or anything like that.
We’d better make sure that if we’re making decisions to buy equipment, to take on different jobs and
this sort of thing, that we had a reasonable consensus on it or that we talked it out. You’re not always
absolutely unanimous on everything but, once we made a decision, we’d all go along with it. There
wouldn’t be any sour grapes. It’s kind of like a cabinet, I guess, where you have to show some
solidarity. If you can’t go along with it, then you need to resign.

<-----Page 164----->151

One of the biggest difficulties is making a transition from half a dozen people to 15 people to 20
people to 50 people and so on. When you start out you have big meetings to decide whether we
should buy two pencils instead of one pencil. Then you finally realize that you’ve got to go beyond
that. It’s not just the management, a lot of your employees can’t make that transition from where
you’re very heavily involved in all the details of buying new fixtures and furniture and all that sort of
thing to making the jump to managing a bigger organization. We were very fortunate in that the
people who left the university and who were really operationally running the business, were able to
go through those various levels. They were very conscious that they had to do that, because we made
a decision fairly early on that we wanted to grow. We saw a lot of opportunities. In the early days, the
managers were in on every aspect of the product, then they’d say, ‘Here’s the general scope, here’s
what we want’, and so on. It wasn’t a set of very deliberate steps, but it grew and the managers were
able to keep going to different levels of the organization, realizing that they could not micromanage
stuff. There’s an old saying ‘the devil is in the details.’ Of course, it’s in the details but you have to
hire people that you can trust to take care of the details. We hired some very good people and, like
any organization, we had a few disasters. Those people, sometimes they’re very good at doing a detail
task and you have to put in a back corner, otherwise you just have to say ‘I’m sorry, the fit just isn’t
there.’ We’ve had some very bright people that didn’t fit in.

Nothing came to us easy. I mean, we really had to work very hard for it. We had to work hard, dayby-day or quarter-by-quarter or year-by-year in order to beat the competition and get our products in a
state where they are highly differentiated. The two reasons for success: one is we pay attention to
detail and the other thing is we stay on the problem long enough to solve it. When I commercialized
the first important component of our technology, we stayed on it for more than five years and we have
technology now nobody else has. At the moment, competitors do not have the patience to develop or
to perfect a product’s technology. That differentiates us from others. We stay on the problem once we
identify that this is really what we want to do. This is the problem we want to solve, we understand
the problem and we know that it is going to help us, then we stay on it.

We considered getting investments from venture capitalists very briefly but I think the venture
capitalists really are just loaning you money and expecting a big return on it. We were more
interested in going in with a larger partner, which had additional technical capabilities in other areas.
The company that we partnered with had a very good accounting system, which we needed. It was a
big help to us, to get that on line. It was also a good fit. They were not in the area that our core
expertise was in. They were in other areas so it was a very complementary thing.

The first thing is to know the market. Know what your customers want. You have a wealth of
knowledge that they are going to use on their behalf but you have to know what they want. One of
the main problems is the communication problem when you’re trying to talk somebody from a
different mindset and they tell you about what they’re doing; often what they’re describing and what

<-----Page 165----->152
you’re thinking that they’re describing are two entirely different things. It takes a while to get to
know exactly what it is that they’re talking about and then have them know what you’re talking
about. I think that’s one of the things to do is see how your interests mesh. It’s an iterative process
usually but I think that’s one very important thing to look after. And the reason I say that is I have a
colleague who wants to commercialize a product. The product that he has is one that no one wants
and he has tried to commercialize for ten years or more. I frankly told him, ‘Look, you have to
modify this so that it will be what people want.’ He hasn’t been too receptive to that. That’s the
second thing: Deal with the right people. He turned this over to a lawyer to commercialize; he
doesn’t know anything about it. He can’t talk to the people who might want the product and so it’s
gotten nowhere.

[Venture capital wasn’t available so] we were forced to be self-reliant. After awhile it became part
of our culture to be self-reliant. We didn’t need the infusion of capital from outside. The company
itself made money and grew as needed. Now, you would get the opposite argument that you can’t
make a great company that way; you need lots of infusion of capital to build this, that and the other
thing. Yes, we are weak in some areas, but we are gradually overcoming that. And the question is do
you want to build again a great company over which you basically have no control. If venture
capitalists come in and take a large percentage of what you have created in order to give you a large
infusion of cash, are you that much farther ahead? You can argue that, “I’m a billion-dollar company
now. I only own one percent, but that’s not bad” but if you owned twenty percent or thirty percent of
a fifty-million dollar company you are just as far ahead. There’s a very interesting balance there. It’s
not clear that having large amounts of money and giving up a significant amount of what you created
is a good thing to do. I have seen companies where the people who started the company have lost
control of it because the people who built the business and constructed it had a totally different goal
set than the people who invested in the company without an interest in the business.

I came from a company town. The most logical route was to go into industry where I spent years
doing all sorts of things. I was introduced to all types of processes but it was really a long grind as far
as getting involved with all these aspects of an integrated manufacturing company. And so one spent
three months in one area, three months with the next and then on to the third, generally on shift work,
so that one got a real grassroots feeling of how one made the products and really got involved with
the people who were actually making these products. I suppose I was also making them myself. At
the same time, night school made it more interesting to find out what was going on. And from there, I
had scholarships to go to university and from that point onwards I stayed doing a normal degree and
then to a Ph.D. So, that’s the evolution. I came into the university very much from an industrial
background as opposed to a continuation of high school. And I think it was helpful because I think I
wanted to know a little bit more of what was going on, more of the fundamental aspects of problems I
worked with in industry.

My feeling very strongly is that technological transfer is carried out more between people than it is
through papers. When the government talks about technological transfer from the university to the

<-----Page 166----->153
society the main conduit for transfer is through the people that the university graduates. It’s not
the papers that the faculty writes. And many university researchers have never been out of the womb.
They’ve gone through university, they’ve done their Masters’ degree, they’ve done their Doctorate
degree, they’ve done their post-doctoral work. They’ve got a faculty appointment and they are
professors. So that they really are sometimes quite, well, I wouldn’t say ignorant, but haven’t quite
had the experience out in the industry. The co-op environment forces university professors to deal
with more mature students, from the point of view of having been out in the world. All you have to do
is interview a student in a non-co-op program and they’re different as night and day. The primary
difference is that the student who has been out in the co-op world will not always believe you unless
you have some legitimacy. They’ve been out there. They say, ‘Well that’s fine but that’s not what I
experienced. That isn’t the way the world works.’ They’re more mature from that point of view.
And, if the professor has to interact with students in a design and development environment, in
project work and things like that, it can condition the faculty member. They learn from it. It’s a
continuous feedback loop despite the university.

The licensee recognized that they needed access to a component of our technology so they hired
somebody to work over there to bring the technology to them. I advertised for somebody to do that
and a graduate student here applied for it and went to work for them in order to help transfer the
technology to them. While he was there, we had lots of communications back and forth of, where he
was saying, ‘Help! I need to do the following task and I don’t know how,’ or something or other.
We’d try to work on the project here for a while and eventually send him some way that he could
make it work. So that was one of the, one of the first little pieces of technology transferred along
these lines with this particular project. It was done in the way that’s most effective, which is by
having a person, who knows how the technology is going to work.

It was clear that this company was losing money a lot faster than it was ever going to make it. One of
my co-founders used to talk about the j-curve and the problem is that the down part of this j-curve
was going to hit zero before it got a chance to turn around and start going up. It was clear that we
needed new markets and a new direction. A person was hired to manage the company; this person
seemed to have a lot of skills and a lot of ideas about how to make the company grow. He put
together some reasonable business plans, and seemed to have the right kinds of contacts and so we all
decided that this person should become the president of the company and the previous president
would move to being chief technical officer or vice-president in charge of technology or something
like that. The new person was going to be the business leader and really push the company forward
to its next stage. He was very keen on establishing some research relations with the university and
establishing some ties with some other companies and getting some government funding. He knew
about how to get government money for small companies and worked on that. After awhile he got a
few government investments, into the company, and then went to private investors and we had the
first external private investor in the company

<-----Page 167----->154
Outcomes
I feel that I contributed quite a lot to the university but at the same time I feel the university
contributed to me. It’s mutual good feeling. I feel that my graduate students benefited. A student that
I met with at a conference last week, he is an executive with a big technology company. If I didn’t
interact with industry, I wouldn’t have given him a good project, good leadership and good advice so
he could achieve what he achieved with his Ph.D. thesis. I think, overall, that my students, my Ph.D.
students, also benefited from my activities. That’s how I feel.

My sabbaticals have been deliberately involved with industry because I like very much to have that
application side. All the sabbaticals have been involved more with industry or government labs
where I’m removing myself a little bit from the university atmosphere. The general theme is to get
involved with ongoing work which is already in place in these institutions. In other words, I’d like to
know more of what they’re doing rather than imposing what I have done as my own dedicated
research. Obviously, the fundamental side of what I know is of value to the companies. And so I
think, there’s a welcome for someone who can come in and help to understand some of the things,
which are going on in industry or in the government labs. But I always like to get involved with
ongoing research. So, there is this, I guess, combination of help both ways to bring in a different
view from their aspect and from my aspect to look at what they’re doing too. So, there is this, I hope,
synergism going on there.

I was conditioned to the possibility of tech. transfer, fairly early on, and always interested in working
on solving real-world problems. I found it exceedingly exciting to work on a problem that people
cared about. The research project that led to the spin-off was exceedingly stimulating because we had
early users of the technology who had lots of ideas about what they wanted us to do and we had lots
of ideas about what the technology could do. Therefore, we were exceedingly compatible.

It’s been an interesting life; the years have gone by extremely fast. If one asked the question ‘Would
you do anything differently?’ I would do a thousand things differently but I don’t have any regrets
from what I did. It’s been a very interesting life. I’ve had a lot of fun and I’m very proud that I’ve
been recognized for it by a number of things, which researchers don’t normally get like prestigious
awards for having a social impact and things like that. I never set out to be recognized that way but
you take pride in what you’ve done. I take pride in what I’ve accomplished in an academic sense and
take pride in the students that have worked with me. Your legacy really is as much in the students
that have worked with you as anything going. A lot of stuff I’ve written and produced, research
results, they have meaning, in the short term. Some of it is relatively long-term if it’s fundamental but
students last a little bit longer than that stuff.

A lot of the interactions with industry have given me ideas that I could use to recruit and enthuse
graduate students to work on problems. When you do projects you see all kinds of additional

<-----Page 168----->155
problems that need to be solved or that could be solved. It provides a goldmine of problems for
graduate students to work on. I also take pride in the fact that the research internally and projects and
consulting and so on, have helped me immensely, in writing my book. When you have knowledge of
what goes on in different countries around the world and what other researchers and practitioners are
working on in different areas, that’s pretty valuable if you’re going have a book that is
comprehensive. I take pride in my book because it’s been received quite well.

[Industry partners are likely to employ people who can make sense of my publications] An awful lot
of my students have gone to work for an employer, like a consulting company, because the company
has begun to know the student through the work. If the student is good and they’ve got a position, it’s
in their interest to employ that student. And that’s been very successful. Even within the local area,
we have quite a number of our former, mine and other colleagues, former students, who have done
extremely well. They’re CEOs of companies, they’re senior engineers with different organizations,
and they’re within academia and so on.

I’m really proud that I surrounded myself with smart people at the spin-off and that we are able to
compete internationally. I’m also really proud of our technology; our technology is leading-edge.

When I was doing a lot of pure research, especially in my graduate lectures, I'd be putting out ideas.
The interaction and the comments and the feedback from the students gave me a lot of research ideas.
I think, by talking about what I was doing currently, I was helping these students. Also, there was an
undergraduate student many years ago. I’d taught him second-year linear algebra. Later, he was
working on his thesis and he needed a lot of linear algebra and he turned around to me and said to me,
‘Why didn’t you tell us that this is important stuff?’ And I said, ‘What do you think I was trying to
do?’ I think I was a better teacher for knowing how it could be used as well as knowing theory. I
think that makes for a stronger teacher, having this balance.

I always felt that one of the most satisfying things was the number of people working at the company.
These are Canadians who have good jobs, they’re taking home money, they’re paying taxes. It’s good
for the Canadian economy, it’s good for everybody. And that’s one of the satisfying things.

[The benefits of university-industry interactions are] two things: interesting problems and how to
modify what we were doing so it would be more in the line of what people wanted. I like to do
something useful. Don’t we all want to feel that we’re being useful. Isn’t it a criticism of professors
that they sit there in their ivory towers, they do nothing for society and they take all these resources.
Why are they wasting their time on research when they could simply do teaching?

<-----Page 169----->156
If we count off the contacts with industry which have been generated through sabbaticals and also
meeting people of similar interests in conferences, I’ve developed very good relationships with these
industrial applications. For instance, I had a student who came from a country in Europe to finish his
thesis. The work he’s been doing has been with developments from Company XYZ and his degree is
from another country in Europe. So, it’s becoming more of an international network as opposed to a
University of Waterloo network.

We did field tests with the product and one of the test users was so in love with the invention that he
didn't want to give it up. We took this as a supreme compliment.

I took on a commercial project that made my research more easily shared and used within the
research community. At the time, I didn't realize how important it was going to be... not from a
financial point of view because it only brings in a modest amount a year. It gives you a certain
prestige or stature in the community that you're working with, far more than I thought. I get people
coming up to me and they don't comment about any of the many papers I've published, they comment
on that project. In fact, it sort of gave me a shock... I didn't realize the impact it does make on the
community until the first conference after and I really got it right in the face, which was nice. It was a
very nice pleasant feeling but I wasn't expecting that.

My one project is an extreme case of something which is nothing in terms of, say, a journal
publication. On the one hand, you’ve got these high-tech publications, and on the other, the low-tech
aspects of taking a simple design and adapting it for use. I’ve had very beautifully inscribed letters
from users, thanking me and that sort of thing. I’ve been on the local news, [laughs] and so on. And
that, in a way, is rewarding. But it has nothing to do with the other side of the university as far as
high-tech is concerned.

Another thing about those seminars, you met people and they met you. So even after the seminars
were over, they had a contact with you. So I would hear from them, they’d phone me up and say,
‘Who should I talk to about this or this.’ You’d get a network established. It’s a different network
than you get when you go to a conference. That very often is the internal network of academia. It
doesn’t reach out beyond academia in many cases.

The research project that led to the spin-off is the activity that I’m most proud to have been involved
in. The spin-off activity is probably lower because I value the research and teaching aspects of what I
do higher than the commercialization. On the other hand, I recognize the importance of the
commercial activity, in contributing to the community, having it pay back the university in many
ways through hiring of people from here and through direct funding back into the university, through
research contracts and through donations. Those things are very, very important contributions.

<-----Page 170----->157

The dissatisfaction here is that this a design that people could be using. I’m not worried about the
money involved; I’m not even thinking about that. I’m just thinking here is a design that people could
be benefiting from but it’s not out there now because of the myopic view of industry. I’m bordering
on anger…

Theme 2: University Environment
This theme explores aspects of the university environment that appear to influence technology
transfer activities. This top-level theme is further divided into four themes: 1) peers and group
norms; 2) academic leadership; 3) university culture; and, 4) experiences with Technology Transfer
Support Organizations (TTSOs).
Peers and Group Norms
The thing I liked about our technology transfer was that was that we had developed a theory that was
needed for the technology. There’s a problem with culture, you know at a university, some people
disapprove of technology transfer, doing something useful, something applied because they think it’s
trivial. Putting together the facts, that can be trivial in the context of theory, together to solve a
problem can be an amazing intellectual accomplishment. I think some people are a little too smug.
They think that well if you’re doing something applied it can’t be very intellectually challenging. I
think that’s wrong. It’s snobbery when people want to think that their work is above application.

There were a few people in my department who felt that any connection with industry was wrong;
that it meant that you were not a real researcher or a real scientist. But it ranged all the way to a few
people who were very interested in doing this with industry and keen and enthusiastic. At least one
colleague was active and doing that kind of thing. So reactions ranged all the way from some people
who thought you shouldn’t have anything whatsoever to do with industry, to others who were quite
supportive; it was the whole spectrum there.

The graduate students benefited and the university benefited because we put a lot of money into the
university. Financially I was not doing too badly because I did consulting for significant pay. Because
it was coming through the university, people could see the amounts. According to a Professor of
Economics at Princeton University, a professor may inherit lots of money, he may marry lots of
money and he may spend lots of money, but he’s never, never supposed to earn lots of money. It is
un-academic. That sentiment was still at the university. We used to live at the university, we didn’t
have any other life apart from the university. A lot of us only interacted with other professors at the
university. And, my colleagues used to say, in the form of a joke, that we were prostituting academia
by being involved with industry. When I was working on my start-up, I got pot shots from my
colleagues: that I was getting rich at the expense of the university and that type of thing. It was not a
good situation for me.

<-----Page 171----->158

No [my colleagues didn’t give me a hard time about making money by investing in the spin-off]. I
think people thought that I owned a lot more of the company than I did. The average person might
have thought that I made a lot more out of it than I actually did. But I haven’t gotten that sort of
negative feedback or concern or anything else.

[My colleague’s reactions] run the full gamut from very supportive and encouraging to others that
have a sense of envy. There’s a sense of envy sometimes, but I guess that’s not unique to a
university. When I received an important award in recognition of the social value of my work a lot of
colleagues were very congratulatory. It’s not that I’m going around looking for that but it’s
encouraging. So there are people all across the university that congratulate you on achievements, and
that’s nice. There’re a few, unfortunately, that make snide remarks, ‘He’s not deserving of it,’ but
that’s their problem, not mine. There a few people who are envious, but, you know, nobody who’s
ever succeeded has ever had entirely unanimous support. The other part of that is that, in the applied
areas of research, contract research is a big part of our research funding here. I try to take on research
projects where I don’t feel I’m competing with the private sector. Sometimes the people that are
expressing the desire to be pure and not do research that is ‘tainted’ believe what they say.
Sometimes, there’s a certain degree of envy. I’ve heard people in other areas of the university
sometimes, “Some of those engineers over there are going around getting rich; going out and doing
consulting and making millions of dollars and everything else.” It isn’t true, it just isn’t true. Any
money I’ve made, I made by risking my money. I probably could have made as much putting it into
GICs in the bank, you know, which is pretty risk free. It’s an argument that I’ve heard many times,
but I think that I can defend what I’ve done.

Colleagues didn’t care, it didn’t bother them. A few colleagues also had had the opportunity to have
research projects with the company and it’s viewed as being generally good. Hiring our students is
viewed as a good thing. It enhances the reputation of the university. That’s viewed as a good thing.
I think more people see the general benefits and appreciate them, rather than being annoyed at some
people making money from it. I haven’t seen that as a problem. And I haven’t noticed it as a
problem with other companies either.

[My colleagues were] almost all completely supportive. I’ve never gotten back any negative
feedback, I don’t think. If there was negative feedback it was mild enough that it didn’t scare me
[laughs]. I think people were pretty supportive. At that time, other companies had been spin-offs of
the University and it was viewed as being a good thing by almost everybody, so it wasn’t new for
most people. I think that it was viewed as part of the Waterloo culture, the Waterloo advantage and I
think it’s still viewed that way now. I mean that new employees, new faculty members see that there
is this potential to be able to take your ideas and commercialize them and benefit from them.

Academic Leadership
It perhaps wasn’t explicit but, implicitly, there was very good support here by the senior
administrators. One of our presidents was a very externally-focused person. He had a lot of contacts.
It’s not that I ever went to him and said, ‘What do you think of me doing this?’ but you sensed there
was a strong encouragement of taking the initiative. Also we had deans that were superb. Certainly
the few times I ever did go to sort of chat with them about internal research initiatives or external
activities, they were entirely encouraging. In other words, you never felt that you were being held
back, that you shouldn’t go out and do things. And one of the vice-president’s of research, even to
this day, whenever I see him he asks about the company. You sensed that he was very supportive of
technology development here being transferred to industry and public sector, being commercialized
and so on. I would say that he was a very strong encouraging influence. We had another president
for awhile who was also a very fine fellow. Again you sensed that you had this implicit mandate to
go ahead and do things. I think that basically we had a good environment here.

[The support for the spin-off] was on all levels: it was the Chair at the time, the Dean at the time, the
VP at the time. Everybody was supportive right off the line in the university hierarchy.

I didn’t cost the university anything during the first years of the start-up even though I was still
teaching a couple of courses a year because the start-up was paying my university salary. I still had
Ph.D. students and I was still bringing a lot of research funds to the research group. If I had left it
would have messed up the students. So I ended up staying at the university and trying to figure out a
way to make it work. I reached an agreement with the dean that I would not suffer if I paid my salary
even if I didn’t teach four courses. When I retired the dean argued that I hadn’t been a full-time
employee at the university because I didn’t have a full course load during the time I worked on the
start-up. Therefore I was not entitled to the full-time benefits for that period. I was short-changed on
my pension. That was not the understanding that I had with them. I felt that the dean was doing this to
penalize me because he did not approve of technology transfer. If a university official, like the
president, asked him he would say he supported it but he was penalizing anybody who was involved
in it. He would find ways to prevent you from getting certain benefits or charging your company the
full increment of your salary. Apparently the penalties I got were really small compared to some of
the penalties for other people. We started comparing notes and we found out he was doing it to all of
us, not just to one individual. Our officials were not prepared to support technology transfer. They
could see the benefits which would accrue to society and were prepared to support it but they
wouldn’t get involved themselves because they were afraid that they would be tainted by getting
involved with business.

I don’t think we had one chairman, in the time I was there, that felt you shouldn’t be doing
technology transfer. We always felt that we had some support there. Even the basic researchers
seemed OK. I’ve always had a very positive feeling towards my department.

<-----Page 173----->160
We really tried to set an organization up within the university and so we had meetings with
university administrators. I remember one day the Vice President of Research said, “Why don’t you
just set this thing up outside the university?” I said, “Well, there certainly would be less red tape and
that seemed to be a good idea.” And I said to him, if we set this up outside the university, I would
pledge that I would not use resources of the university for our personal use. That was a very
significant moment because it was almost a sigh of relief. I didn’t want to rip the university off. I
wanted the university to have every opportunity to participate if they wanted to but it became obvious
that there were so many problems that it would have been better for us to do it ourselves. All of us in
the start-up breathed a sigh of relief, when they said, “Why don’t you take it outside?” That was a
famous moment.
University Culture
In the early days there was almost a revolution of young people. It was an era that fostered this, “You
can go out and do anything you want.” We became much more conservative later on. I don’t have
the capability to be able to really interpret it well but obviously we knew what was going on. There
were occupations, there were protest marches, there were all kinds of things going on. As
researchers, a lot of us were on the sidelines saying ‘Gee, what’s going on?’ I think you were very
conscious of what was going on, but you really couldn’t understand it. In fact I think the radicals and
protesters themselves didn’t understand it. So yeah, it was an interesting era. Very much different
than we have today. I’m not sure how much that impacted what we did but maybe the entrepreneurial
open spirit we had at that time may have been part of it, either caused by it or going along with it. I
really don’t know. But the fact is it was an era that was very amenable or conducive to doing what
you wanted, whether you wanted to be a radical, a protester, or whether you wanted to be an
entrepreneur, establishing research programs or whatever you wanted to do. It was sort of a different
era than today.

Before I worked at UW, I worked in a research environment where we were not allowed to really
explore our potential. The management and the environment really were not conducive to really
exerting yourself. Some of the other researchers felt that the other new guys and I were undermining
them because they didn’t want to push themselves. At the beginning, they used to come and talk to us
one by one telling us that we ought to be careful not to hurt ourselves by working so hard. Later on
they started unplugging our experiments. All we wanted was to get in and advance the field. We
didn’t care about getting brownie points or getting a high salary or whatever.
Waterloo was very different. There was a lot of excitement. A lot of trying to build something and
that was very exciting; it was a very exciting period. There were no bounds on what we could do at
UW. The dean at that time said, “Put this faculty on the global map” and that’s what we did. He was
promoting research excellence, good research published in good refereed journals. He provided the
leadership. He indicated that you were contributing to the advancement of the field. We worked very
hard to put the faculty on the academic map. The working environment was completely different from
the environment I had had before. There were no bounds; you could produce as much as you could
and not only in research. We started modernizing the undergraduate programs. We started developing

<-----Page 174----->161
undergraduate laboratories, so we improved the undergraduate program and the graduate
programs. We started publishing in highly-respectable journals, refereed publications. After a while,
my research group at the University of Waterloo was well-recognized internationally. So that was
quite a fulfillment. I miss the excitement of that time. It doesn’t exist now in the present environment
of the university. There was an involvement whereby you were building something and that
excitement, it was a fantastic excitement.

In the early days, Waterloo was moving and growing very quickly. And I was invited to come here
and see what was going on and look at the possibilities, you see. When you think about Waterloo in
those days, it was the darling of the, the Ontario governments with its new co-op program. And it
was moving very, very quickly indeed. And anyone I suppose less than, younger than thirty, had, had
a lot of sense of it could go a long way with all this encouragement. It was an exciting time. In
retrospect, it was a gamble, it was no question because it was feeling its feet. And I suppose in those
days, you know, being younger and perhaps less conservative, it was worthwhile giving it a go, there
was nothing to lose.

Waterloo itself is an entrepreneurial place. We did many, many things here in the early days. For
example, there was a new technology out there and people desperately needed to know about this. So
we actually went out and taught courses. That’s in the days when if a brochure came on your desk, it
was rare as opposed to today, you just throw it in the garbage because there’s so many of them. We
went on the road to all sorts of places and taught courses. We raised a huge amount of money, all of
which went into resources for research on campus. That was my first real experience being an
entrepreneur.

An entrepreneur is someone who has interesting, exciting ideas and they want to make them real
someway and get them out to individuals. The University of Waterloo, we wanted to sell the ideas
that we had, we were a clear choice to go to school, an interesting place to go to school. We had good
people here, we have good students here and we wanted to convince the rest of the world that
Waterloo is not a bad place. And it looks like we’ve succeeded. That’s what I mean by
entrepreneurial. You’re excited about what you’re doing and want other people to be excited about it
and participate too.
The university isn’t as entrepreneurial as it used to be, which I think is a shame. I guess there were
always people around here who weren’t entrepreneurial per se, they were here to teach and just do
research. I teach and do research too but I get excited about my ideas and I try to sell them to other
people.

UW had a very entrepreneurial spirit. I don’t mean that so much in a commercial sense, but in the
sense that people were enthusiastic and energetic. We didn’t realize it at the time but there was very
little bureaucracy here at that time. Bureaucracy grows as an organization gets older, like creeping

<-----Page 175----->162
fungus. If we wanted to do something that made sense and we could talk our colleagues into it,
the attitude was, “Sure, let’s go, get on with it.” We had a dean who was very highly supportive.
You could walk into him with an idea and he’d say, “Well what’s holding you back? Go ahead.” I
think there was a lot of trust too in those days. The trust was primarily internal, like from the dean to
the chair of the department, the administrators trusted you to go out and do something useful and they
gave you literally free rein to do it. We were kind of unaware of it at the time but looking back, this
attitude and enthusiasm and encouragement were very influential in the growth of this place. And
obviously the people you attract to that kind of thing; you attract younger people who have energy
and enthusiasm.

I think Waterloo had some very remarkable people. Ralph Stanton, who started the math faculty, for
example. He had graduates that he also taught in Portuguese and Physics. He had the largest
Portuguese library in Canada. This is not your typical man on the street. There were those sorts of
people around, some very clever and innovative people that made the University of Waterloo what it
is today. [Resistance to doing work with industry] came to the university later. There were a lot of
innovations and things that people would try. Then we got bigger, maybe we got successful. I don’t
know what you would call it. We became established. That innovative spirit, a lot of it died. What is
the last major innovation in a sense of starting a co-op program or something like that that you know
that’s happened at this university?
Experiences with Technology Transfer Support Organizations (TTSOs)
At one point the start-up was partly owned by a government-funded technology transfer support
organization (GTTSO) that wanted to sell their shares and get money for it. At that time, foreign
investors were interested in buying technology companies. I was not prepared to do that. The GTTSO
was pushing for it and I was not prepared to sell because I wanted the business to grow. I later found
out that the person I dealt with at the GTTSO had a personal incentive which was based on return on
investment. He had personal incentive to see the technology sold rather than be built-up in Ontario.

We went over to the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office over here at the university and we
talked to them about a patent and how do we go about it. And they sat down with us and we said
okay, ‘We'll carry the ball for you on this.’ So the university really came to our aid, there's no doubt
about it. And they did all the correspondence with their patent lawyer and they started the patenting.
The most frustrating part in the whole thing was this patent, reading over all the details from the
patent office. The patent office response said that a completely different technology with a different
use had the same capability. I almost went down to Washington and said, ‘Who's the guy who wrote
this thing? [laughs] Let me strangle you... [continues laughing] How stupid can you be?’ That was the
most frustrating part. I was a bit disappointed with the university’s patent lawyers. All they did was
take the patent office reply to the application out of one envelope, take a look at it and send it back to
us, saying, ‘You come back with your counter arguments.’ Meanwhile, while charging another $7000
or whatever it is.

<-----Page 176----->163

I have had extremely limited contact with the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office. I don’t
mean to sound really negative on this but I have to be honest. Quite frankly, I felt that the amount of
bureaucratic or administrative support you get can be more constraining than it can be helpful. I think
those offices are probably more conducive to the young faculty member who really doesn’t know
how to go out and license or commercialize his or her idea. I think that for more experienced faculty
members, they’re probably not that much help.

The university’s equity stake in the start-up got transferred into a technology transfer support
organization (TTSO). After the equity was sold, it appeared that the money didn’t go to the university
… it stayed in the TTSO. I was very upset at finding out that the money did not go to the university. I
did not do a proper accounting when I gave that equity to the university. I did not sit down and say,
“This share is worth so much.” I just made a good gesture. If it was for value added, I wouldn’t have
given them so much. So when the equity was sold and the money did not accrue to the university, I
was very upset about it.

The Technology Transfer Support Organization (TTSO) was almost useless when it came to helping
with the new company. As it turned out, they weren’t actually part of the university but they tried
hard to make people think they were. They wanted to own a piece of the company. We almost ended
up in a lawsuit by the time that was over because they claimed about half the value of the company by
giving us access to an engineer to help us with the product development. It turned out later on that
that engineer had never been to university, he wasn’t an engineer at all. He had a high school
diploma and had worked at a local company to do some high tech stuff but they were billing him as
an engineer. We discovered when he made some suggestions for our product that were completely
unphysical, he didn’t understand the science of the way the product worked at all. I had to get a
lawyer and break that off.

I think the University of Waterloo’s policy in giving the professor ownership of, of intellectual
property is a good one. Most Canadian universities don’t act that way, so that’s a big positive in my
mind for the University of Waterloo.
When we first started developing technology in the lab, I approached the university for help with the
patenting. The way things work at the University of Waterloo, if the university helps with the
patenting then they expect to own something. In other words, they paid out money, so they expect to
get a return on it. That makes sense. As it turned out, I visited the technology transfer office and they
looked at the technology and said, “No, we don’t think the university should put in any money into
that technology.” I went ahead and had the patent put in without their help.
I applied for these patents and some of them started to issue. When I started to apply for patent
number two, people knew that we were applying for another patent. At that point in time, the
university said, “We’d like to help you with the patenting of this one.” I said, “You didn’t help with

<-----Page 177----->164
the first one. If you start helping with the second one or the third one, then you start getting
ownership but the risk was in doing patent number one.” I didn’t ask them for help with the second
or third patents or any of those because I felt if they were unable or unwilling to help with the first
one, they shouldn’t be able to buy in later after most of the risk has been done. They agreed with that.

When the university refused to help with the patent, it was because they did not see a way to license
the technology, and most university technology transfer people are focused on licensing. They don’t
understand that there are a lot of technologies that are not licensable. My technology is a perfect
example of one. In the early days, we tried to license this technology and we could find nobody who
even knew what it was all about, let alone was interested in licensing it. I think the problem is that if
you came up with a new chemical process and you take that to the licensing office, they’ll go down to
the chemical industry down the road and say, “Do you want to license this process?” The chemical
industry may say, “Yeah, that, that looks really great, we’ll license that.” But if you’re doing
something really new, there is very often nobody out there who will license it. From my experience,
one of the major problems is the technology transfer office is thinking about licensing only. The idea
of the professor starting his own company is a waste of time. The professor doesn’t know anything
about business and therefore it will fail. Certainly that was the case when I started my spin-off.
There was nobody out there who even understood what our technology was, let alone was interested
in licensing it. Even if there had been somebody out there who understood what the technology was,
we would never have found them. I think this is a major problem in technology transfer. In the U.S.
it’s not nearly such a big problem because there it’s quite common for professors to start companies.
The SBRI grants are set up to fit that situation exactly and they’ve been very successful. There’s no
equivalent granting agency in Canada and the technology transfer offices in Canada don’t expect that
to work. They may have changed by now. I don’t know but I doubt it. They understand licensing and
they don’t understand letting a professor start his own company. It’s not just at the University of
Waterloo; I’ve talked to technology transfer officers from all over and they all talk about licensing.
That seems to be their focus.

I don’t think we would have been able to commercialize the technology through the university
because our technology is really a management system. It’s just not a type of product or service that
you can realistically market out of the university. That’s not to say that the university’s bad or
anything, it just isn’t the type of thing that you could have done. Other products and services could
be.
Working with the TTLO just wasn’t feasible. We would have been too constrained. That’s not a
knock against them, it’s just the type of thing that they’re not really set up to do. They’re more set up
to take an inventor’s idea and help in getting the patents and the licensing, etc. I’m not saying that
they’re well set up to do that, but they’re more … You know, I’m really not aware of what the
university really has to help inventors in that sense.
Those people over in the Office of Research, and possibly in the TTLO, really have trouble living
up to the expectations that professors have because they’re also burdened with all the bureaucracy
they have to deal with. I’m not questioning their motivation. They’re pretty good people, they try

<-----Page 178----->165
hard, but they’re committed but they’re understaffed, I think. I don’t think there’s any lack of
motivation but sometimes there’s demoralization, which is natural when you get overworked and
understaffed and pushed. Let’s face it, faculty members can be bloody boorish and demanding, at
times. You know, if you talk to any of the administrative people, they sometimes get yelled at by
faculty members who act like little children. There’s no excuse for that at all. Just not on.

After the first project failed, I didn't go to the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office to try to get
a patent for the second project because I couldn't really see the market. We did the market test on our
own and it failed. I thought, ‘I don't think the Technology Transfer Office would like it, especially
with our experience with the first failure.’ I had gone to the companies and said, ‘Look. I’ll give you
the design as it is now. I’ll sign it over to you.’ If it had gone ahead, I would have gone to the
Technology Transfer people at that point in time and got them to come in on some legal document but
it never did get to that stage unfortunately.

[The university support through the technology transfer office] certainly was valuable but… There’s
a place here where we’re talking about candour and now I’m kind of against the barrier. I think that if
the university is going to do something like have a technology transfer office, the staff there should
not expect some portion of the companies which are being developed. Universities should hold equity
positions. I have nothing against that. But the individuals representing the university shouldn’t. A lot
of the businesses that went through that process were [allegedly] asked for a percentage, a share of
the business, by an individual who worked in the technology transfer office. I don’t think that
anybody regrets giving money to the university. But you have somebody who probably is on the
university payroll also acting as an individual for a share of the company… There was a lot of
resentment from a lot of companies, people among those companies… And some people just avoided
that office completely.

We built a couple of test units. I made the measurements myself and it worked as predicted. People
were interested in it. I presented the results to the trade association. They thought it was great.
Because I was so busy, I turned to the university, who would develop and license things developed in
the university. So, I gave them the rights to the invention and verbally I told them, “Under condition
that you do not license to Company A,” whose management I had come to distrust. To me, they were
dishonest. The university came back to me, I forgot how long later, weeks or months later and they
said, “We have licensed the invention, we have an exclusive licence with Company A. ” So the
licence gave Company A an exclusive contract to manufacture the invention. It made quite a few of
them based on what I was telling people, by my reputation. We started calling up how they were
working, and they weren’t working. And our first thought was that a particular critical component had
failed. I had the university call Company A and ask about that component and they responded, “Oh,
that component’s too complicated to put in. It’s not included…” So Company A had had
manufactured this thing incorrectly, they didn’t work and within two years, the idea was dead.

Theme 3: Rewards and Reward Systems
This theme contains vignettes related to rewards and rewards systems related to technology transfer
activities. These rewards systems are elements of the university environment; they were captured in
this top-level theme because of their importance with respect to this thesis. This top-level theme is
further divided into three themes: 1) Intellectual Property (IP) policies; 2) financial rewards; and, 3)
other reward systems.
IP Policies
IP policies range across the country, from the UBC model to models like Waterloo, which is probably
the most generous of any university in Canada; the IP belongs to the researcher although the
researcher can make a deal with the university. I think that if the university-owner model were
applied right across the board to every bit of IP developed or every product or research product or
service, it would work fine for some. Others, like our type of thing, it just doesn’t work. It wouldn’t
be practical. I’m not sure how other university-owner institutions operate but, I think there has to be
some flexibility in that. I can see that if you use your university resources, you get research funding
that comes from the university or the university provides the environment and covers a lot of the
overhead, they should get a piece of the action. But, I think, Waterloo’s attitude, and again it’s not
explicit, is more that if I become successful, then there’s an expectation, or a hope, that you will be
generous in turn by providing endowments to the university. And I think, like that’s personally the
model I prefer. In fact, I contribute to an endowed chair. It’s a model that would hopefully generate
just as much income for the university as the other model where the university owns the IP because
there’s a marketing cost associated with that too, that may or may not pay off.

It is claimed that Waterloo had generated, I’ll say, twenty-two percent of the spin-off companies in
this country that have spun off from universities. That’s a phenomenal record. So you have to ask
yourself, what is it that, that’s happened. I would sort of define a spin-off as any company that sort of
came out of the creative juices of some individual, whether it was a professor or student or whoever,
that caused them to go off and start an organization up. I think we’ve been so successful because I
think one of our key features here is the intellectual property policy, which basically says, “You
create it, you own it.” Other institutions have much more complicated policies. There’s an attempt to
require that the university should share in the ownership. When that happens, the first thing that
happens is you get into discussions as to who owns what. You know, if I have an idea in this office
and then I rent a garage down the street and do all my work in the garage down the street, does the
university have a share? I don’t have any idea how you decide that. So, you don’t want to even go
there. I mean, can you imagine if I have an idea and then I go and try and sell it, and get into an
adversarial situation where the university is challenging my right to have ownership of this idea?
Because they paid me to have the idea didn’t they? I mean, paid my salary. Did I have the idea in the
shower? Did I have it in this office? I have no idea. This really complicates situations very easily.
If the university just says, “You own them,” it is has eliminated a lot of the complication. First of all,
the IP policy’s simple. It’s a very good thing because frankly it avoids a whole lot of wasted energy
on trying to figure out what make sense. The second thing is that universities then often set up

<-----Page 180----->167
corporations to exploit this IP. They hire people, some of these people are very competent, but, 1)
they probably don’t understand what it is they’re selling in many cases and, 2) they don’t have any
passion about it. They’re just selling something. You don’t have the originator behind the idea, the
person who said, “I think this is just terrific. I’ve just got to go out and make this happen.” I think
there’s a real problem there. I think if you look at some of these corporations that have been set up to
exploit university IP, they’re not very successful. I could be wrong but that’s my sense.

I don’t know how it works in other institutions but the University of Waterloo says, “I own my
invention.” Now, I have to exploit it. I can exploit it myself or I can seek outside or inside help. If I
wish to seek inside help, there are people at the Technology Transfer and Licensing Office, who
supposedly know at least some of the questions and answers. There will be a fee for that service and I
can pay the fee in different ways. I can pay cash or I can give a share of what might come out of this
or whatever. There’re mechanisms in place to allow me to acquire this information. Although what I
know, I’ve just learned, that’s all; we talk among ourselves and talk to lawyers when we need to.
What you’re suggesting is that there should be a formal structure at the university that manages this
IP, manages its sales, etc. What I’m saying is that there could be a structure in place to provide
certain services, which I can buy, but I don’t have to buy. That’s what we have here at Waterloo. I
have personal opinions about how well the TTLO works but I don’t want to comment because I’ve
never used them. We’ve always gone our own way. We have enough collective understanding let’s
say. I think people that have intellectual property, have to have a passion for what they are doing.
There’re successes around here and those people had a passion for what they were doing.

If you’re a university like Queen’s where you have a very large history and a very eminent medical
faculty, there’re pharmaceutical products developed. Queen’s, from what I understand, has a heck of
a good amount of revenue from the patents and products that have been developed there. That’s
grown over time. I think it’s more amenable to things like pharmaceuticals than it is to a software
package, for example, because a software package isn’t something that you could just take and
transfer it. Plug it in somewhere to a commercial application. Who does all the upgrades on it? Who
does the continuing improvement and redevelopment, which our company has to do, if you’re going
to stay competitive. The university is not set up to do that sort of thing, at all, unless somebody’s
giving me a contract to upgrade the package, and to do software maintenance, the university isn’t
equipped to do that either. So it’s just a different type of animal, even though I think both are
legitimate within the university environment.

[If UW’s policy switched to university-ownership] I think we would lose a lot of future faculty
members in the high-tech fields. I don’t know that we’d lose current ones. We might. We’d
certainly lose future ones. It’s a big attraction for hiring. In most cases, would it make a huge
difference in how things actually end up? Like who makes how much money from what? How much
does the university gain? How much does the individual gain on the projects that get
commercialized? Probably not because there’s already a sharing between individuals and the
university in various ways. A reasonable university would probably still try to encourage the

<-----Page 181----->168
individuals by actually paying them fairly richly for doing the commercialization and allow the
same kind of activity to go on. So, in the instances where commercial activity takes place, my guess
is it would be structured very similarly to the way they are now. I don’t think as many would take
place. Certainly, not in the short run, at Waterloo. I think that there’d be a big drop. What’s worse is
that, in the long run, the potential would go down because we would hire fewer entrepreneurial-type
people. I’m absolutely convinced of that. It would be a very bad move for Waterloo.

The university was very helpful actually. The university has a policy that if you have some sort of
intellectual property development it belongs to you. In return, I think people like to return something
to the university because of that. It certainly is an incentive thing and I think that’s an oversight that
other places that haven’t done as well. I know places that have tried to develop research parks and
they end up just giving cheap rent or in this conflict… So I think that’s a major thing at U of W. And
also our president at the time, he was very entrepreneurial. And so the spirit was ripe for doing this
sort of development.

Something that is very important at the university is that they do give the university professor
ownership of the patents. I think that’s very important and I think that should continue. Most
universities claim percentage ownership and the problem with that is when you set up a company, the
investors in the company don’t see the university’s ownership as being helpful. In fact, they see it as
a very negative thing to have the university involved. The reason for that is because they know that,
if the company needs money and investors are expected to pony up and put more money in relative to
their stock ownership, the university will not do that, they never will. And so they don’t look upon
the university as being a useful partner. I don’t think most people at the university realize that.

One of the things that Waterloo has done, that I think is a catalyst for what’s happened to Waterloo in
terms of turning out new companies, is that Waterloo has encouraged people to put the results of their
work into practice. And they’ve done that by allowing the people who do the research to own the
results of the research. And that’s the only university in Canada, I believe, that has that rule. At all the
other universities, either the university owns the intellectual property or the university will share the
intellectual property with the investigator. In our case, it didn’t make any difference because we
didn’t take intellectual property from the university to set up the company. All of our intellectual
property had already been published in the literature and we just wanted to see it applied in the best
possible way. But, I think the feeling is that it’s part of what the university wants us to do. And you
then go the extra step and see it applied.
If you’re going to do a lot of extra work, if you’re going to do the eighty hours a week to get
something going and the university owns ninety percent of it, whatever you produce, then you lose
incentive to do it. And it’s not only the money, it’s control. You know that you worked your buns off
and in the end it doesn’t matter because if the university owns the technology and they decide that
you’re not going to use it in that way and then everything you worked for could be destroyed in a
moment. I mean, if you do it, if you own it, then you’re responsible for it for better of for worse. If

<-----Page 182----->169
you make a mistake, then you suffer. If you do well, then you see things grow. You don’t have
that other ownership body out there who really controls what you’re doing and has the ultimate say in
what you’re doing. It’s also pride, I think, and you do something because you want to see it flourish.
The most important [way to foster academic entrepreneurship], is the one I mentioned. That the
intellectual property rights reside with the researcher. The sense of ownership… it’s more, “Is this a
part of you?” You’re reputation is on the line. It’s your idea that’s on the line. So it’s more a sense of
ownership, I think, than pride.

The downside of the current policy is making sure that everybody is signed in and gets included if
they should be included and that we really know who owns what, at the time. I think it can be
addressed better. I think that Waterloo could put some more effort into making sure that everybody
works early on to establish who owns what. If something gets developed, making sure that the
developers are all included and that everybody knows who is a developer and who is not, early on.

So that worked very well and because of the early success in being able to license a few universities
through the university, we could see that there was a potential for a spin-off. Because of the inventorownership policy at Waterloo we were able to see a future for us in putting in the extra effort needed,
at the end, to make this work.

The university policy of inventor-ownership is supportive of this spin-off formation. It means that the
individuals have the option to put more effort into something with the potential payoff to themselves,
as opposed to the university dictating that whatever the individuals do, the university has the right to
decide how things happen with it and therefore you’re always subject to the university’s whims:
whether or not something can be commercialized in the way that you think it should be or could be.
My guess is that the company wouldn’t have started if the intellectual property was university-owned.
Who within the university would have said, ‘Let’s do it?’ And how would the university have
convinced us, the people who actually did it, that we should do it on their behalf? We did it because
we wanted to do it and we didn’t have to ask somebody for permission.

The IP policy says that inventors don’t legally owe the university anything but I think there’s been
moral obligation, felt by many people who have started companies, to pay the university back. In
some senses, there’s an investment back into the university, that’s where some of this moral
obligation comes in. It’s not just paying for activities that happened but it’s rather paying back the
university so that the university can start other new activities. It’s more of a forward-looking moral
obligation rather than a past payment of debt kind of obligation.

<-----Page 183----->170
Financial Rewards
Everybody who worked on the research project that was the basis for the spin-off was given an
opportunity to invest. I had reasonable access to money, so I was able to invest without risk. In other
words, if the money disappeared, it disappeared. I wasn’t going to cry. Well, I’d cry but not very
much. So we were all in this together. We continued to do our research but we invested in a little
company that was just starting up. We were always very careful to make sure that we always did our
job at the university and we followed the policies and rules at the university very carefully. It wasn’t
the case that it was all very well orchestrated because you can not ever create the perception that
working at the university is a way to get rich because it isn’t. There’s nothing wrong with making
investments. We all do that. It’s called the stock market, bond market or whatever. If we can work
together so that we both win, that’s a good thing to do, which is what happened. So, I want to be very
careful how one says that because it can be very easily misinterpreted.

It’s not money. I don’t think that was ever the motivating factor. If money was the motivating factor, I
would have just stayed in consulting and done straight consulting. It’s the fact that you can see
something grow, you can see a place where your other students can move to do really meaningful and
exciting work. And there are lots of things that are more important than the actual financial rewards.
There are two ways of being rewarded, at least two ways. One is financial and the other one is the
good feeling of seeing something flourish. Certainly financially: it was fair. I felt fairly rewarded.
Financially it was fine. Not like a dot-com where you make many millions of dollars. It was very
rewarding in terms of seeing something grow and flourish and do well in Canada. It still gives me
pride when I go to a trade conference or go to a conference where I see people talk about what
they’ve achieved using our products. Especially to trade conferences, where every year, there’d be a
huge number of presentations of people who had done work with many different applications. And
it’s all done with products that I played a role in bringing to the point where it can be used. So there is
a pride and it’s a ‘feel good’ that you've done something to make the world a little bit better place.

I’m not worried about getting any recognition for this. I’ve received international awards, national
awards and career awards for the things I’ve done so another one’s not going to make any difference
to me. I guess I’m more interested in having satisfied users, just to talk to them and say, ‘How are you
finding it?’ and have their eyes light up and them say, “It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread.” If,
afterwards, I made a little money that would be a benefit but that wasn’t a certainty at that stage of the
game. In fact, if it was money that I was interested in I might have taken a different route. I would
have short-circuited some of the things to get to the answer quicker. Instead, I was determined that
this wasn’t just going to be a design out there that looked better, I was going to analyze the problem
in the most rigorous scientific way to show that my solution is better than anything out there.

I think in academia, you can create real serious problems for yourself if you talk about making money
through technology transfer. Academia does not celebrate wealth. That’s crass, that’s commercial.
They celebrate other things, they celebrate publications, they celebrate good teaching, they celebrate

<-----Page 184----->171
honours: The Order of Canada, Fellow of the Society of Canada, and that kind of stuff. There is
a different set of criteria by which they measure success. You can be poor as a church mouse but, by
God, you’ve got three hundred publications. Now, is that good or bad? I’m not going to comment.
It’s all where you stand.

When entrepreneurs outside of academia, make it big, they expose it. Like an entrepreneur friend of
mine and his Ferrari. In that culture that’s one of the marks of success. Counting wealth in an
academic institution is, in my opinion, not smart. You don’t see me driving up here in a Rolls Royce.
I own a modest car, I mean it’s a nice car, but it’s a modest car. I don’t own a Ferrari, I’m not
interested in one and all that stuff. I can let people know where I’m coming from if I have to, if it’s
important for some specific reason, but no you don’t want to shout your wealth in an academic
institution. You’re just asking for trouble because a lot of academics are ‘poor’. Academics are fairly
well paid on the average, better than say, the average working man by quite a bit. They’re paid to do
mostly what they want to do, which is explore and have fun but I don’t really mean to play around. I
mean there are very serious scholars that are doing the work they want to do. They’re not working in
an office making twice as much money, but hating every minute of it. They’re doing what they want
to do. A lot of them will retire with a comfortable pension but they’ll never have a lot of money. So,
it’s best to leave it alone. You can create envy, jealousy, etc. You can create that anyway in any
society. I don’t wish to say universities are any different or any better or worse than any other
society.

When I say I am not interested in money, all it means is that I’m not interested in accumulating
personal monetary worth. I’m not interested in that but it doesn’t mean that I don’t know how to
create it. They’re two completely different things. I was never interested in trying to accumulate one
million dollars, two million dollars, ten million dollars, fifty million dollars. That’s not what I set out
to do. I was more interested in and I still am interested in how to get the company to grow. Now the
company has to be profitable. If the company is not profitable it will not create more technology. I’m
interested in technology. If you look at the core values of this company you’ll find that our aim is to
create better and better technology but to do that you need money, therefore you have to be profitable.
And I know how to look after a company to make sure that it is profitable. But I’m not personally
interested in a lot of money. There is a limit on how much I can eat, there is a limit how much I can
wear, there is a limit on how much I can travel. Those needs could be satisfied, not with millions, but
maybe with thousands. So that’s two different things you see? Of course, I was always interested in
providing comfort to me and to my family and I still am, but it doesn’t mean that I’m interested in, in
money. I like to be comfortable, yeah. I like to have a warm house; I don’t want another cold house. I
could afford to have a house which is 200,000 square feet with swimming pools and extravaganza and
all that. I’m not interested. I’m interested in comfortable clothes. For example, the shirt I’m wearing
probably cost $30 or $40. If I was interested in money, I would get a shirt which cost $400 or $500. I
got a present, an Armani shirt which cost $400. But I really don’t need a $400 shirt. You see the
difference?

<-----Page 185----->172
You have to have some motivation for the people doing it. I don’t think the commercialization
always happened as much without that incentive. People will just pursue their research. Why do
people, who are just doing pure research, who aren’t doing commercialization, why do they publish in
journals? There are three reasons. First, they want to let their colleagues know what they’re doing,
and they want to be able to read what their colleagues are doing. The second thing is it’s publish or
perish, right? And the third is you don’t get research money unless you publish. These things would
happen but not to the extent that they happen without the monetary incentives. Also, we did a lot of
research as part of our jobs but we also spent a lot of time that wasn’t the university time pursuing
these things.

One of the early investors in the company wanted to put money in the company. Unlike everybody
else, he didn’t want to have a share of it. We forced him to have a share of it. As far as he was
concerned, putting money into the company is guaranteeing future employment for himself. He’s an
expert in this area. The company will know that he’s an expert and they come to him when they want
him because they’ll know that he’s the best in what he does. And, just having one more company in
Waterloo who hires people is a good thing for him, personally. That’s why he invested. Part of me
says that about the company with respect to the university, too. So having started it off, having it
grow and now having it be as successful as it is… I think it’s a great thing for Waterloo. I’m proud of
what happened with it and proud of my role in it.
Other Reward Systems
A number of years ago a graduate of my department made a career out of offering seminars for
people in industry; they’d be one day seminars or weekend seminars. We went to large Canadian
technology companies or he would gather a bunch of engineers from around Toronto together. Now
the point was, I could do this because by that time I was a full professor, so it was no skin off my
teeth. But I sat on many promotion committees, and certainly when it came to the question of rank or
promotion for a junior professor, an assistant or associate professor, that activity would count for
nothing. Now that activity was a way of transferring stuff out of the university environment because
we were doing studies on technology development. We published them in journals and things like
that but nobody we ever ran into ever read any journals on it. I’ve never run across very many
industrial R&D-types who spend very much time reading journals. But if you gave a seminar and
charged them $500 or something for the seminar and took them off to some place to talk about it
they’d come. But that’s not a method of dissemination that universities used.

I think the university really has to compartmentalize and say to researchers, “Look, not only do I pay
attention to somebody who’s producing fundamental work but I also like to reward those who are
doing applied research: the guys taking the research and applying it to solve particular problems in
the society. It’s not that it has to be high tech, but the standard has to be of considerable level. Also,
the university has to identify good teachers. It’s no good just to say, “Oh, he’s a good teacher.” If he’s
a good teacher, he has to come up with techniques and facilitate much better transfer of knowledge
from him to the student. The university has to compartmentalize that expertise and not to expect

<-----Page 186----->173
everybody to develop in all directions. Most of the universities are not doing it. We talk about the
University of Waterloo. They could have the luxury to say, “I’m going to compartmentalize and I
want to reward individuals who are really good fundamental researchers, reward individuals who are
applied researchers, and reward good teachers. They’re not doing that because it takes a lot of effort
at the top level to put this process in place. They’d have to work with the faculty association because
immediately when the faculty association sees that the university’s trying to change things, they
assume that they’re out to screw them, you see? So you’d have to basically work carefully with them
and you’d find that the faculty association would be cooperative because they’d realize that it’s
something which is good for them and it’s good for the university. It’s good for the individuals. But
it’s a lot of work to do that and come up with processes.

The answer [to how to promote university-industry relationships] is like a lot of things, in my view.
The most you can do is create an environment. I think whenever there’s a big plan where government
throws in millions of dollars and a centre of excellence is set up and five industries are brought in
here and ten universities come in here and they produce a big program. To me, those things almost
always fail. I think what has to happen is that there has to be encouragement and there has to be an
environment, which fosters entrepreneurial things. I think people have to start off on a one-on-one
basis working at a low level and then see things grow. I believe in bottom-up, not top-down. You
only set up a big structure to handle something, which is already working. You don’t set up the big
structure first and then try to plug people in to make it work because it’s just a scramble for money
and there are fights. The motivations are all wrong.
I think the answer is you just create an environment which facilitates these sorts of things. You
encourage it verbally and then you let the individuals try to fulfill those goals as best they know how.
And that will be different for everybody. I think they should be encouraged to take risks. That’s a
huge, huge part of it. That people are allowed to do things, which are risky without hurting their
reputation and career within the university. You should be allowed to fail, that’s part of research. The
way we do research in the universities tends to be you’re rewarded for the things you succeed at,
which is very unfortunate because some of the things you don’t succeed at are the most important
issues that exist and you should be allowed to fail and try again, and fail and try again, and still not be
marked down because of your failure. It’s very hard because the university, like everybody else, tries
to quantify us. So your advancement through the ranks depends on successes, your pay depends on
successes. So it’s hard to allow people to take risks.

It’s very difficult, I’ve found, for practicing engineers and practicing engineering academics to drink
coffee together. They’re operating on different incentive systems. If I’m out in the practice of
engineering and I’m out there starting to develop a product my future lies in the success of the
product. If I’m an academic my future lies in the success of publication. Those are different and
facing in opposite directions, quite often. Academics get frustrated because the practicing person
isn’t really interested in coming to a conclusion and the academic isn’t really interested in the fact that
this is going to be a product and we have to take into account a number of other considerations that
are outside of my field of expertise and so it’s hard for them to work together. You have to set up a

<-----Page 187----->174
situation where they work together and the difficulty is both organizations, the academic
organization and the industry organization, don’t set up incentive programs to have them work
together. And industry is always resenting having to pay money to their practicing people to go off
and do a lot of brainstorming or, ‘If we let them spend too much time with this bunch of academics
they’ll get to be too theoretical’. It costs them money. It costs a lot to take an engineer out of his
environment and send him somewhere for a week because you lose all that productivity and you lose
all of the people that they relate to in your organization or out because there’s a hole that week. And
similarly university departments aren’t very amenable to see a faculty member going and spending a
week at a company. What’s he doing? Where’re his students? So it’s very hard.
There is a certain onus on those three parties, industry, academia, and government, to set up
rewards systems that encourage the coming together of academia and industry; that don’t discourage
it. That’s particularly true in universities where you have applied faculties like engineering and
architecture and things like that. Now in Germany or in Europe it’s not nearly the same problem
because the institutions that teach applied stuff are not embedded along with the pure researchers so
they can have their own rewards system. The one thing that happens within a university system you
see is that you get all these different faculties: arts, health studies, environmental studies, engineering,
science and mathematics. And the only common ground they can talk about is publication. So at the
university level, publication becomes the fundamental measure; everything else is secondary to it.
Then after publication comes teaching and there’s a commonality here that they can get at. But when
you get to an architectural faculty member who designed a new museum, how do you relate that to
what the historian has done? Design activity is not a common thing to all departments and all
faculties in universities, so it doesn’t count. Ask any architectural faculty member how hard you have
to fight to get the fact that you’ve designed a building that was built recognized within academia as a
legitimate reason for being promoted.
I think there are different rewards you know. Applied math and science students are rewarded by
the phenomenon, ‘Look, Ma, what I built!’ Whereas pure math and science students very often are
rewarded by the Eureka phenomenon, ‘Now I understand!’ Well, for a lot of applied students,
understanding something isn’t the end of it. How do you apply it? To what? Build what? That’s why
many of those students, once they graduate, get somewhat alienated from the university. The
university’s rewards system isn’t involved in this sort of, ‘Look, Ma, what I built!’ sort of thing. It’s,
‘Look, Ma, what I now understand.’

Theme 4: Attitudes & Motivations Regarding the Role of the Professor
This theme captures information regarding the participants’ attitudes towards research directions and
the role of the professor and/or the university in society and some descriptions of those aspects of
being a professor that they do or don’t enjoy. Therefore, this top-level theme is further divided into
two themes: 1) attitudes; and, 2) job elements and job satisfaction.

<-----Page 188----->175
Attitudes
I personally feel our job is to really act as a dictionary or a lexicon as far as industry is concerned. In
other words, there’re a lot of things we do here, which I don’t think are understood by industry.
Maybe we’re using the wrong terminology. There’s got to be someone, maybe like myself or
someone who we’re teaching, able to translate what we’re doing to be understood by and be used by
people in industry, you see. We can do all sorts of wonderful things but I guess the important thing is
to use them. In many respects, that’s really important thing. We can do all this work and really what
does it mean? The thing is only any good if it’s useful.

Faculty members have three basic jobs within the university: research, teaching and service. If you
had something that could be exploited, for societal good and maybe for your benefit as well, and it
does not conflict with those other duties, please do. I know a bunch of guys who got together and
said, “We’ve got some neat ideas here,” and started up a company. I didn’t see them let down on
their academic duties and at least one of them holds a prestigious research chair and is very wellknown in his field.

[That there is a problem of maintaining objectivity in research when doing contracts] is probably
truer in the pharmaceuticals field than it is in my field. I’m sure the medical and pharmaceutical types
are subject to a lot of criticism because they are ‘bought by Pfizer’ or whoever. We get some of that
too. You know, if I did a project for a company, the nuclear industry would accuse me of being
bought by the hydro-electric industry. I’m exaggerating a little bit, but the fact is that the best thing
you can do is try to maintain your objectivity, let the chips fall where they may. We’ve done projects
for lots of large companies and we get criticisms that we’ve been bought off by one or the other, but I
think we can defend every piece of research we’ve ever done for them in the sense that we absolutely
let the chips fall where they may. We don’t falsify results. If you do that, you’re going to be found
out. So you cannot compromise your integrity. You’re subject to criticism, there’s no question about
that.

[The applied side of the sciences is] a great source of interesting problems. James Watt developed the
steam pump and, because they wanted to make these things work efficiently, they started thinking
about pressures and measurements and ultimately we got not just the steam engines but the Second
Law of Thermodynamics. Gauss, a great mathematician, started looking at applied astronomy;
always looking up at the stars. Think about how much we’ve learned about physics because people
are interested in astronomy. Applications feed the theory and theory feeds the applications. It seems
to me there’s got to be that interaction.

I argue both for the pure and applied. I think in a university I’d want that sort of balance. I often find
myself arguing with advocates of pure research on one hand and their opponents on the other hand
and I have arguments with both of them. [laughs] We need some sort of middle ground.

<-----Page 189----->176
If you’re doing something that is very technically-oriented, you’re going to attract different
people. They’re no less bright, but their interests are quite different and they want to be doing applied
stuff and they don’t really care about the theory as long as it appears to work, it seems to be good in a
lot of practical cases. But you can’t advance it unless you know the theory. The better thing is to
have them both in balance. Then you get the cross fertilization.

If you get to be at a point where you’re just a minion of the industry then what will happen is you will
gradually be shifted from fundamental research to being a product designer because product design is
the thing that industry wants. It wants a product you can sell. The researcher wants to generate new
information that people can use. A lot of universities couldn’t even care whether it’s useful. It’s just
new information. They’re the two ends of the spectrum. If industry dominates it will be up at this
end all the time. If the university dominates you’re down here all the time. So our faculty’s role is to
act as an interlocutor between those two things.

I think that university should be doing work, which, if it sees application, it will be five to ten years
down the road. You’re not aiming at next year or next month. So it’s not the short-term goal that you
should be pursuing it. It’s the long term goal. It’s to light the path so that you or other people then can
do the applications in the future. If you’re just doing bread and butter things, you’re not really
learning. You’re not advancing state of the art, there’s no research component to it. It’s no good just
having a scientific problem. You solve it and then you publish a paper and that’s great. Now you have
to really try and take it to the next step. Is there a way I could modify this technology or develop it a
little bit further such that it can solve a specific problem somebody has? And that problem could be a
small problem or large problem. Then you adopt it or change it a little bit further to solve another
problem, then it starts growing.

There isn’t any technology or research output which, if it’s properly identified and properly
understood, couldn’t solve problems which will be a benefit to the society. It doesn’t matter what
technology it is, it could even be in the arts. It could be a person who is helping with speech therapy
for kids. She’s coming up with techniques and those techniques are technology. If it’s properly
understood and properly documented, that technology can be used in a different area to solve another
problem elsewhere. It’s good for the society. It’s good that it displaces old technologies and
introduces new technologies and then it also introduces new jobs and so on. So, it’s a good solution
for the society and for the country. People think that technology has to be technical, but not
necessarily.

There’s too much focused research, mission-oriented research. If you make it too narrow I think it’s
going to choke off things because you could specify a certain goal, if that’s all you’re after you may
or may not get to it. And when you get there it may or may not be as important as you thought
before. But if you have the flexibility to go in the direction and the inclination to apply what you’re
doing then I think having a greater flexibility has a much greater social value in the long run.

<-----Page 190----->177
Job Elements and Job Satisfaction
[The best part about being a professor is that] I get to do what the hell I like. I enjoyed the acting part
of teaching and I enjoyed having all these bright people around to sort of discuss and argue with and
being able to maintain that. But just freedom is the thing. You can’t price that. You don’t make as
much money; if I had been out in industry, I could have probably made quite a bit more but I was
working with some really neat people. My colleagues are really neat people, a lot of fun. We had no
idea of what was going to happen when we invested in this company. We took a chance because it
seemed like an interesting thing to do and we had some good ideas and very clever people. You have
to enjoy what you’re doing. I can’t say I enjoyed absolutely every minute of it, but damned near. We
worked hard but we worked hard because that’s what we liked to do and that’s nice.

My board of directors advised me that I had to let go the research; had to let somebody else run the
research of the company and I did. I let it go but I didn’t give up trying to stay with the technology:
going to conferences, understanding it, I’m just not doing hands on research. Sometimes I miss it, so
whenever I have to give a talk about technologies, I sit down and I research. I enjoyed it very much,
you know.

I don’t like the bureaucracy that goes along with some of the research contracts and projects. I mean
who does? Particularly, now that our university’s become more bureaucratic over time… That’s the
way things are, so I probably spend much more time than I want to on dealing with the financial
services people and so on, keeping track of accounts and stuff like that. Doing all the paperwork that
goes along with research contracts. That’s the drudgery of it. I don’t think I’m unique in that sense.
I don’t think anybody likes that kind of thing.

I think it is a beautiful subject. There’s a certain beauty to the logic. But it’s very hard to explain to
people who don’t know the field.

[The best part of my research day is] trying to come up with ideas that make sense. The question I
always have is, “Why?” I think a lot of people follow the trend. I quite often don’t do that because I
look at it and I can see problems with it. For example, in some things, we really haven’t advanced
because the technology is just as complicated as before. And that’s great for job security, but it seems
to me it’s wrong. So I’m very much for simplification.

I think it is being my own boss, to a certain level that I get to choose what I want to do. Not all the
time, not every day, not every hour of every day but generally being able to set my own goals and my
own agenda and my own timetable. I like the interaction with the students. I like the interaction with
other profs, working with them. I think that those are the major attractions.

<-----Page 191----->178
I like working on projects with colleagues. I like the belonging to a lot of organizations. I’m on
committees; I chair different things and so on. I think the attraction in working with colleagues is that
quite often you’re plowing new ground, in the sense that you’re solving new problems. As applied
scientists that’s what we like doing, you know. I like the diversity of the projects that I work on too,
rather than working on project after project within one particular area. One of the advantages you
have is when you have a lot of experience, is that you have a way of attacking problems. Even
though you may not know a heck of a lot about the area, you hopefully are smart enough to know
where the pitfalls are, and smart enough to know that somebody else has probably worked on this
problem before. You find out what has been done, so that you don’t reinvent the wheel. You know,
it sounds simple, but it’s probably experience that, if anything, teaches you that.

[The best part of doing research] can happen when I should be sleeping or off and on during the day
when I’m into something. My wife is very understanding so if I go into a deep concentration she
knows what’s going on. It can happen any time I guess. It’s frustrating [laughs] and very satisfying,
both. I can’t explain why that is but for example you’re lying awake at night when you know you
should be asleep and you’re going through calculations where you’re doing a theory or something.
I’ve always tried to take time to do outside things that I’ve enjoyed apart from my university work
and I sometimes feel I’m cheating on that, to do research.
In my first year of undergrad, I was taking a course that I really liked. And I was studying for it in
a library with a whole bunch of other people. We all had exams at the same time, starting at one
o’clock and I was there about twelve. And at two-thirty I looked up and the place was deserted. I’d
been concentrating so much on this material that I had no idea that anything had happened.
Everybody got up and went. So I had to go and track down the professor and he gave me an oral
examination on the spot and, of course, since I was concentrating on this material there wasn’t any
problem. [laughs] You know I lose myself in things like that.

Theme 5: Career Decisions
This theme includes excerpts related to two aspects of career management: 1) work/personal life
balance; and, 2) mid-career change.
Work/Personal Life Balance
My wife really raised our kids. I didn’t spend as much time with the kids. My wife was also a
professional but she decided not to work and then she looked after the kids. She looked after our life.
We went to the theatre and we went to concerts but I have no idea of where she’d get the tickets. The
kids’ birthday parties and all that, I was there when they happened but I did not set them up. I used to
work during weekends for the university. There are trade offs. If it wasn’t for my wife, a smart
woman, I could have never have achieved what I achieved.

<-----Page 192----->179
[The long hours at the university and spin-off didn’t affect my personal life] too much because,
fortunately, my wife is very understanding. Her full-time job is at the house, and when a lot of this
was going on, the children were in high school, so it wasn’t a big problem with having little kids at
home. They were a very supportive family, so it really wasn’t a problem, thank God.

It is a big factor. My wife is an unbelievable person. She’s just always been supportive. We’ve tried
to be supportive of each other. Yes, there were demands. But, the reason I mention this, I had a
colleague involved in another technology transfer. His wife wasn’t that supportive and ultimately it
tore the marriage apart.

I had an understanding family, they’re great. My wife has been so good to me over the years. She’s
allowed me to work sixty, seventy hours a week, and kept the operation at home going, and kept our
kids happy and well adjusted and did a terrific job.
Mid-Career Change
I did design work on a consulting basis for different companies. It was very lucrative. I was also
doing consulting through the university and we used to do the some of the consulting through that. So
money was not a consideration, it was not the motivating factor at the university. The motivating
factor was to innovate and that was quite exciting.
I wasn’t sure whether I would be able to continue being able to innovate as I got older. So when I
looked at those who really innovated at a much higher level than I did, they were in their twenties. So
I felt that I would not be able to innovate at the same rate I used to innovate before. I thought that as I
get older my work will become incremental. Therefore, I should try to develop the technology.
I was not interested in consulting because there is no scope for leverage. If you trust your
technology to a company then you can’t have it multiply and create more technology and more jobs
and so on. You can’t see the results. At my start-up, you can see it.

I enjoyed being a prof. I like teaching, I enjoy undergraduate courses, I liked being able to do my own
research and decide what I wanted to do and so forth. I enjoyed being a professor, I was just there too
long. It would be very nice if after twenty-five years, you could automatically look at going into
another, another job but the way the pension plan worked at The University of Waterloo, you were
locked in. They tell you when you’re going to retire and you really don’t have any choice. I would
have left earlier if I could have taken my money out of the pension plan. I just felt I needed to do
something else. The way the situation works now they really have you tied up to age sixty-five. If
you could go between fifty and fifty-five, then during the time you were a professor you could, you
could plan your life and say, “Okay, at age fifty or age fifty-two or whatever, I’m going to start a
company and try and commercialize the technology I’ve developed in the lab, or I’m going go and
work at NRC, or whatever. But they won’t allow that. You’re stuck there until they let you go. The
early retirement penalty at the University of Waterloo is so large that you really can’t consider

<-----Page 193----->180
leaving more than five years early, at age sixty, and that’s already too late for a second career. I
feel very strongly that they should allow people to leave at, say, age fifty so they still have time for
another career. But that’s not the way it is.

[I started the spin-off] because it’s fun. It’s exciting and I really enjoy it. It’s a real challenge and
it’s different as well. One of the problems of being a university professor is there’s two possibilities:
you can be a university professor and after about twenty years you’ve done everything that you can
do as a university professor and then you can become Dean or you can become Chairman or you can
get involved in University administration in some way. That’s a common thing to do but I was on the
back end of a hiring bulge. Most of the administrative positions of the university were not open to me
because there were a lot of people in that bulge right ahead of me. I saw my opportunities would lie in
companies and I liked that.

[I enjoy technology transfer because] it’s a challenge. The main thing is the challenge. The other
thing I liked about it is: imagine the stupidity of it, if I had spent all these years working at the
University of Waterloo on this technology and had not started the company. All of the value, the
commercial value and the research would have just been lost because nobody else would have done
anything. It’s not the kind of thing that you can license because there’s nobody out there who wants
to license it. I felt that, if I could use it and develop real products and have some effect on science by
developing those things, it would be great fun to do and I wanted to see it done. Otherwise you write
your papers and the papers get published in journals and five or six people read the paper. Then the
paper is there, forever stuck between the pages of that journal, and it doesn’t mean anything. To a
large extent, I felt that it was a way that I could make the results of my research a lot more
meaningful and useful, and I could generate some jobs for people. I find it a hell of a lot more fun
than just going and teaching classes every day. Teaching classes was great for the first twenty years
but after you’ve done it for twenty years it gets pretty boring. I can’t imagine how people could stay
and just keep doing the same thing over and over and over for all those years. It would drive me nuts.
