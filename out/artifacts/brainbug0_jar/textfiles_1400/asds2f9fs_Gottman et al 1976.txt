Distressed and nondistressed couples in two studies made decisions on highand low-conflict tasks. They continuously coded both the intended impact of
their own behavior and the impact of their spouse's behavior. In Study 1 distressed couples did not differ from nondistressed couples on how they intended
their behavior to be received. However, the behavior of distressed spouses was
actually received more negatively by their partners than the behavior of their
nondistressed counterparts. The couples in Study 2 also behaved in a way
consistent with a communication deficit explanation of distressed marriages;
that is, distressed couples' behavior was likely to be coded as more negative
than they intended. Task effects and a reciprocity hypothesis were also tested.
Data from Study 1 showed no conflict effect, but the results of Study 2 suggested that high-conflict tasks may be a better means for discriminating distressed from nondistressed couples than low-conflict tasks. The data on reciprocity indicate only minimal support for the view that distressed marriage is
characterized by less positive or more negative reciprocity than nondistressed
marriage.

Jones, 1973; Lederer & Jackson, 1968; Rappaport & Harrell, 1972; Stuart, 1969; Weiss,
Hops, & Patterson, 1973).
The two hypotheses are independent. High
base rates of positive behaviors do not imply
reciprocity. For example, Birchler et al.'s
(1975) finding of higher rates of positive behavior in nondistressed compared with distressed couples does not imply that reciprocity
is different for the two groups of couples. Although nondistressed couples may seem to be
reciprocating positive behavior more frequently than distressed couples, that may only
be an artifact of the higher probability of
positive behaviors in nondistressed couples.
By emitting more positive responses, nondistressed couples increase the probability that
one partner's positive response will be followed by the other partner's positive response.
What needs to be demonstrated is that a particular consequent code in a sequence can be
predicted from a particular antecedent code.
The test for reciprocity is that the diagonal
elements of the first-order Markov matrix of
conditional probabilities must be significantly
greater than the relative frequency of the consequent code (Patterson, 1974). For example,
the conditional probability (p) of a conse-

Recently, two different hypotheses have
been proposed to describe conflict resolution
in distressed and nondistressed marriages. One
hypothesis, based on behavior exchange theory, is that it is more likely that nondistressed
couples will produce behaviors coded as positive by observers than will distressed couples.
This hypothesis has recently received some
support (Birchler, Weiss, & Vincent, 1975).
A second hypothesis is that there is a
greater reciprocity of positive exchange in
nondistressed than in distressed marriages.
Reciprocity of positive exchange has been suggested as the central characteristic of successful marital interaction in the clinical literature
on marriage counseling (Azrin, Naster, &

cedure, it is the couple who codes the behaviors exchanged, not independent observers. It
is possible that what is coded as a warm smile
by two observers is perceived as a sarcastic
smirk to a spouse, and conversely, a "putdown" or "interruption" that is coded as negative in Birchler et al. (1975, p. 352) is not
always seen as negative by the couple.
The concept of the couple coding their own
behavior raises the question of whether distressed couples differ from nondistressed couples in the intended positivity of their messages. According to the widely accepted
communication deficit explanation of marital
distress, distressed couples are presumed to
intend their messages to be received as far
more positive than they are in fact received.
However, it could be that distressed couples
intend their messages to be more negative, or
less positive, than nondistressed couples. If
the messages were then received as more negative, or less positive, distressed couples would
be communicating well; their spouses would
receive the messages as intended. A communication deficit explanation of marital distress
would seem more appropriate if intended positivity of messages differed markedly from the
coding of the messages received. In this case
messages received would not be coded as the
sender intended them to be coded.
In the present investigation, couples interacted using a "talk table," a device we constructed in which only one person could speak
at a time. After speaking, the speaker coded
the "intended impact" of his or her message.
Before speaking, the listener coded the "actual
impact" of the message. The talk table need
not constrain the behavioral repertoire of the
interacting dyad as in Speer (1972); the talk
table is apparently an inexpensive, simple way
to study behavior exchange in marriages, especially compared with detailed ratings of
videotapes (as in Birchler et al., 1975). However, before this can be confidently asserted,
the talk table must demonstrate its ability to
elicit different patterns of exchange in different kinds of couples.
One purpose of the present investigation
was to assess the effect of the experimental
task on the coding of the interaction. The efect of situational context on marital and
family interaction has been either ignored

or minimized (Riskin & Faunce, 1972). For
example, Haley (1964, 1967) placed no importance on the tasks he chose for families to
work on. Jacob and Davis (1973) reported
considerable stability across experimental
tasks to the structure of talk and interruptions
in father-mother-child interactions. One potentially important dimension of contextual
variation that has been ignored is the degree
to which the decision-making task induces
conflict. For example, all of Jacob and Davis'
(1973) tasks were low-conflict tasks. It would
seem theoretically important to ascertain
whether the variables derived from behavior
exchange theory can discriminate nondistressed couples from distressed couples in lowconflict as well as high-conflict tasks. The
present investigation employed two sets of
tasks that induced either high or low conflict.
The tasks ranged in content from a consensual
ranking of a list of preferred dog breeds to
the discussion of an actual unresolved marital
problem.
STUDY 1

Method
Subjects and selection. Thirty couples responded to
an advertisement asking for couples who either
classified their relationship as "mutually satisfying"
or "experiencing marital difficulties." All couples
were offered $10 for participating, and it was made
clear that no therapy would be offered. In addition,
other distressed couples were recruited from local
campus and community mental health centers. Of
the IS distressed couples who participated in the
study, 11 were referred from clinical sources and 4
responded to the advertisement.
Two major definitions of marital distress have
been used, self-report of satisfaction and whether or
not the couple comes to the attention of public
agencies such as marriage counselors or divorce
courts. Diverse measures of marital satisfaction have
been shown to tap the same basic factor (Burgess,
Locke, & Thomes, 1971). The Locke-Wallace Marital
Relationship Inventory (MRI) is the most widely
used of these inventories; it has excellent discriminative validity in cross-sectional studies (Navran, 1967)
and good predictive validity in longitudinal studies
(Terman & Wallin, 1949). Using the cutoff scores on
the MRI recommended by Burgess et al. (1971, pp.
330-331), only high-scoring nondistressed couples
and low-scoring distressed couples were included in
the analyses. Specifically, distressed couples in which
at least one spouse's MRI score was less than 85
were included, and nondistressed couples in which
both husband and wife MRI scores were greater than
102 were included. A distressed couple was selected
for analysis only if at least one spouse was dissatisfied

<-----Page 3----->BEHAVIOR EXCHANGE
with the marriage (low MRI), and a nondistressed
couple was selected for analysis only if both spouses
were satisfied with the marriage (high MRI). Using
these cutoff scores, in Study 1 10 distressed couples
and 6 nondistressed couples were selected for analysis
from the sample of 30 couples, all of whom had
completed the experimental procedures.1 Coefficient
alpha for the sample of Study 1 on the MRI was .88.
The two groups of couples did not significantly
differ in age, educational level, or the number of
years married. Couples were, on the average, 24.95
years old and had been married an average of 3.22
years.
Procedure. Interview teams were composed of one
male graduate student in clinical psychology and one
female undergraduate. There were four such teams,
and each couple was interviewed by one of these
teams. Spouses individually filled out a problem inventory, a demographic information sheet, and the
MRI. The problem inventory asked each spouse to
rate the perceived severity of a list of problem
areas. The couple was then asked to agree jointly
on the three most salient current problem areas or
areas of disagreement in their marriages. Next, the
couple was asked to describe each of the problem
areas separately and to provide a specific description
like a play-by-play account of an incident, providing
situational context and a typical conversation illustrating each problem. This was done in order to establish a rapport with the interviewing team and to
provide specificity to the problem to be discussed on
the talk table. The talk table is a double sloping
table. A toggle switch on the side of the table operated by the couple lit a button on the side of the
spouse who had the floor to speak. There were two
rows of five buttons. The five buttons on the left
were used by the speaker to code the "intended impact" of his or her message; the five buttons on the
right were used by the receiver to code the "impact"
of the message received. The buttons were labeled
"super negative," "negative," "neutral," "positive,"
and "super positive." Although partners could see one
another, a metal shield blocked the buttons from the
view of the other person so that neither spouse could
see the codes assigned by their partners throughout
the experiment.
In order to familiarize themselves with its use,
each couple was then asked to converse for a few
minutes using the talk table. When the couple indicated they were comfortable with the talk table, the
experimental tasks began.
Each couple then completed three low-conflict
tasks: (a) The choice questionnaire (Haley, 1964)
is a consensus decision-making task that requires an
agreed-upon ranking of personal preferences using
lists such as new cars or breeds of dogs, (b) Three
Thematic Apperception Test cards (Locke, 1961)
required the couple to create jointly one story for
each set of cards, (c) One of two tasks was administered first individually and then again for
consensual ranking; one task (called NASA) involved
rank ordering 15 items for their survival value for
a life-and-death trip to the moon. Correct answers

17

had been supplied by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (Hall, 1971). The other task
designed for this study (called the food task) involved rank ordering 10 items according to their
nutritional value. Correct answers had been supplied by a nutrition specialist at Indiana University.
A pilot study with 147 undergraduates, conducted to
determine whether there was a sex bias to the tasks,
revealed no significant sex differences in knowledge
on either of the tasks. The couple also completed two
high-conflict tasks: (a) The Inventory of Marital
Conflict (IMC) (Olson & Ryder, 1970) has been
frequently used in marital research. The IMC is a
high-conflict consensus decision-making task, in which
the couple is presented with three short vignettes of
marital conflict and required to agree on which spouse
in the vignette is primarily responsible for the problem,
(b) The couple was also asked to discuss a current
problem that they had agreed in the interview was
most salient and asked to try to come to a mutually
satisfactory resolution of this problem. Within each
session the five tasks were randomly ordered. Distressed couples were told that a report would be written that they could read and discuss with the interviewing team and that could be sent to the couple's
therapist with their written permission.
Results and Discussion
Multivariate analysis of variance of spouses'
coding of their partners' behavior (impact),
combined over all five tasks, with distressednondistressed as a between-subjects factor and
husband-wife as a within-subjects factor resulted in a significant effect for the distress
factor, Wilks-Lambda F(4, 25) =4.54, p<
.01, and no significant sex or Sex X Distress
interaction. Table 1 presents the univariate
F ratios that contributed to the distress multivariate F ratio. Nondistressed spouses were
more likely to code their partners' behavior as
positive and super positive and less likely to
code their partners' behavior as negative than
their distressed counterparts.
Multivariate analysis of variance of spouses'
intent resulted in no significant distress, sex,
or sex X distress F ratios. There were no significant differences in intention for either
husbands or wives on any category. For comparison with the impact data, Table 2 pre1

Analyses on couples were also done regardless of
their Marital Relationship Inventory score to study
the effect of the convergent operations procedure for
defining the two groups of couples. The same pattern
of results emerge from these analyses; a similar pattern of F ratios were significant but were not as
large. This suggests that multiple criteria improved
discriminability for classifying couples.

sents means and univariate F ratios for distressed and nondistressed couples.
These results are consistent with the data
obtained by Birchler et al. (1975) for observers' coding of the couple's behavior. Birchler et al. found that distressed couples were
more likely to emit negative and less likely to
emit positive codes than nondistressed couples.
Furthermore, the results support a communication deficit model of marital distress. By
looking at Table 1 and Table 2 in combination, it can be seen that the distributions of
intent and impact are similar for nondistressed couples. This was not the case for distressed couples. Both groups of couples were
nearly identical in the way they intended their
behavior to be coded. Therefore, for distressed couples, their behavior was coded as
far less positive than was their intention.
Conflict effect. To check the low-high conflict manipulation, the videotapes of four
couples, two distressed and two nondistressed,
were randomly selected and coded for agreement and disagreement. The first 2 minutes of
each task were coded, with coders tallying
each occurrence of an agreement or disagreement. There were four pairs of coders; each
pair coded only one couple. Coders were blind
to the task hypothesis and as to whether the
couple whose tape they were coding was distressed or nondistressed. The total number of
agreements and disagreements were calculated
separately for each coder, summing over highand low-conflict tasks. Coders were first
trained using an interaction category system
developed in our laboratory (Gottman,
Notarius, & Markman, Note 1) and reached

criterion on an achievement test, which tested
their knowledge of agreement and disagreement codes. One coder was designated the
coder and the other the reliability checker.
Correlations between coder and reliability
checker over the four couples were .93 for
agreement and .93 for disagreement. In the
low-conflict tasks, there were averages of 10.33
agreements and 6.92 disagreements; in the
high-conflict tasks, there were averages of 5.38
agreements and 8.00 disagreements, x 2 (*) —
4.23, p < .05. In research on family interaction, agreement and disagreement have been
shown to be the best consistent discriminators
between distressed and nondistressed families
(Riskin & Faunce, 1972). Agreement-disagreement ratios less than one are characteristic of distressed families, and ratios greater
than one are characteristic of nondistressed
families. For the low-conflict tasks, the agreement-disagreement ratio was 1.49, whereas for
the high-conflict tasks it was .67.
To assess the effect of high- or low-conflict
tasks, the five received impact codes were considered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
1 (super negative) to 5 (super positive). The
same Likert scale was constructed for the intent codes. Scale scores were separately averaged for the three low-conflict tasks and the
two high-conflict tasks. An analysis of variance was performed on the impact data and
on the intent data, with two levels of distress
(distressed-nondistressed), two levels of sex
(husband-wife), and two levels of conflict
(high-low). As expected, there was a significant F ratio for the impact data on the
distress factor, F(l,56) = 15.37, p < .001.
Distressed couples averaged 3.04 and nondistressed couples averaged 3.52 over all tasks.

There was not a significant conflict effect,
F(l, 56) = 3.86, p > .05, although the means
were in the predicted direction (high-conflict
M = 3.17; low-conflict M - 3.39). There was
no significant sex main effect or any significant interactions. On the intent variable, there
were no significant effects for any factor or for
the interactions.
It was thus possible to discriminate distressed from nondistressed husbands and wives
on how positively they coded their spouse's
behavior regardless of the level of conflict the
task induced. These results support the Jacob
and Davis (1973) findings and extend these
findings to high-conflict tasks.
Reciprocity. Four analyses of covariance
were performed to compare p ( W + / H + )
with p ( W + ) , p ( H + / W + ) with p ( H + ) ,
p ( W - / H - ) with p ( W - ) , and p ( H - /
W—) with p (H—) for distressed and nondistressed couples. Probabilities were separately
computed for each couple. In each case the
unconditional probability was the covariate.
Because of the relatively low frequencies of
the super-positive and super-negative codes,
these were combined with positive and negative codes, respectively, for the sequential
analysis. The test of the reciprocity hypothesis of distressed versus nondistressed marriage
is the significance of the group F ratio on that
portion of the conditional probability that
cannot be predicted by the unconditional
probability. For example, the residual in regressing p ( W + / H + ) on p (W+) must be
greater in nondistressed couples than in distressed couples. This means that knowing that
the husband has just coded the wife's behavior
as positive increases the prediction over the
base rate of W + that the wife will subsequently code the husband's behavior as positive. The direction of the prediction is obviously reversed for negative reciprocity; that
is, there should be more negative reciprocity
in distressed than in nondistressed couples.
Table 3 presents the results of the analyses
of covariance. There is some evidence that
there is more positive reciprocity in nondistressed couples than in distressed couples.
Though the degree of gain in prediction from
conditional to unconditional probabilities is
small for nondistressed couples, the analysis
of covariance controls for the possibility that

STUDY 2

Method
Subjects and selection. An independent sample of
14 clinic and 16 nonclinic couples was recruited for
participation in the research project. All clinic couples
were seeking therapeutic assistance for marital problems at either of two community mental health
centers; nonclinic couples responded to a press release that briefly described the project. Both clinic
and nonclinic couples were paid $10 for participation.
Precisely the same cutoff scores on the Locke-Wallace
MRI as in Study 1 were used to select 12 distressed
and 8 nondistressed couples for analysis; all 30
couples completed the experimental procedures. Husbands and wives in the two groups did not significantly differ in age, educational level, number of
years married, or salary. Couples in the present study
were on the average 32.50 years old, had been married an average of 9.44 years, had completed an average of 13.95 years of schooling, and earned an average salary of 11.44 thousand dollars. Thus, the
couples in Study 2 had been married approximately
6 years longer than the couples in Study 1 and had
approximately 2 years less of schooling. The major
difference between the samples in the studies seems
to be the length of time the couples were married.
Procedure. Based upon the results of Study 1, the
procedure was modified as follows: First, two tasks
were selected: the Inventory of Marital Conflict
(IMC) as a high-conflict task and the food task as
a low-conflict task. The IMC was selected because
it is a standardized task, it appeared to induce a
high degree of conflict in Study 1 in both groups
(nearly all couples fought considerably on this task),
and it could be expanded to include additional
vignettes to ensure a sufficient sample of interactions

for stable estimates of conditional probabilities. The
food task was selected because it induced little conflict in either group in Study 1. The IMC was expanded to include three additional vignettes.
All sessions were conducted at one of two community mental health centers nearest the couple's
residence. It may be the case that the lack of differences on intent variables in Study 1 may have resulted from the couples not understanding that they
were to code how they intended their messages to be
taken by their spouses. More explanation and a
specific example was provided for the intended
positivity codes of the talk table than had been
provided in Study 1.

Results and Discussion
Multivariate analysis of variance of impact
data, with distressed-nondistressed as a between-subjects factor and husband-wife as a
within-subjects factor resulted in a significant
effect for the distress factor, Wilks-Lambda
F(4, 33) = 7.01, p < .001, and no significant
sex or Sex X Distress interaction. Table 4 presents the univariate F ratios that contributed
to the distress multivariate F ratio. Nondistressed spouses were more likely to code their
partner's behavior as positive than their distressed counterparts. These results replicate
those of Study 1. A comparison of the multivariate F ratios suggests that the results are
even stronger here. This may be a function of
the differences in the length of marriage in the
two studies, since marital happiness is known
to decrease with length of time married within
the age ranges of the current two studies
(Burgess et al., 1971).
Multivariate analysis of variance of spouses7
intent resulted in no significant distress, sex,
or Sex X Distress F ratios. There were no
significant differences in intention for either

husbands or wives on any category. This pattern of no differences is similar to that obtained in Study 1. For comparison with Study
1, Table 5 presents the means and univariate
F ratios for distressed and nondistressed
couples.
These results lend strong support to a communication deficit explanation of marital distress: In the two studies, although distressed
and nondistressed couples do not significantly
differ in the way they intend their messages to
be received by their spouses, they do significantly differ in how the messages are actually
received.
Conflict effect. Conflict effects were assessed
in the same manner as in Study 1. An analysis
of variance on the impact data found no significant main effect for conflict, 7^(1,72) =
2.29, p > .05, although, again, results were in
the predicted direction (high-conflict M =
3.48, low-conflict M = 3.57). This result is
consistent with that of Study 1. As expected,
there was a significant F ratio for the impact
data on the distress factor, F(l,72) = 14.57,
p < .001. Distressed couples averaged 3.33,
and nondistressed couples averaged 3.72 over
all tasks.
There was a significant Distress X Conflict
interaction for the impact data, F(l,72) =
8.44, p < .01. It was easier to discriminate
distressed from nondistressed couples on the
high-conflict task than on the low-conflict
task. Distressed couples averaged .70 lower
on impact scores than nondistressed couples
on the high-conflict task; distressed couples
were .13 higher on impact scores than nondistressed couples on the low-conflict task. There
were no significant main effects or interaction
effects on the intent variable.

BEHAVIOR EXCHANGE

The presence of Group X Conflict interaction effects in the second study and their absence in the first study is interesting. It may
be that the food task is a different kind of
task for the couples of Study 2, since the husbands in this study are working and hence
are less likely to have a role in food preparation than husbands in Study 1, who are more
likely to be in school and share in the housework. The pilot study with both tasks, mentioned in the Procedure section of Study 1,
found no significant sex differences in knowledge on either of the food or NASA tasks;
however, a subsequent pilot study with college
students found significant sex differences in
self-ratings of confidence (on a 9-point scale)
in the solution for the NASA task, /(68) =
2.16, p < .04, with females less confident than
males. It may be that working husbands in
Study 2 have as little confidence in their
knowledge of food as the female undergraduates had of their knowledge of space. Both
groups of husbands may have yielded more on
this task and consequently been perceived as
more positive by their wives. It may also be
the case that the length of marriage factor
was related to the obtained interaction effects.
Perhaps couples who have been married longer
(Study 2) have learned to exchange more
positive messages in low-conflict situations
and to avoid situations of high conflict. This
is consistent with the clinical picture of the
"stable-unsatisfactory'7 marriage (Lederer &
Jackson, 1968) or the "united-front" couple
(Kramer, 1968), who can present a satisfactory image of themselves to the public in social situations but are unable to hide behind
this image when discussing real marital issues.
Overall, there seems to be evidence that the
conflict level of the task influences how
spouses code each other's behavior. In the
first study it was equally easy to discriminate
distressed from nondistressed couples whether
they were discussing an unresolved personal
issue or rank ordering a list of dog breeds.
In the second study couples could be discriminated only on the high-conflict tasks.
These results may account, in part, for the
difficulty of obtaining consistent differences
across studies between distressed and nondistressed families (Jacob, 1975). It would be
wise to sample systematically from low- and

high-conflict tasks in future investigations of
couples and family interaction. The results of
the present investigation would suggest that
high-conflict tasks are more reliable for discrimination between distressed and nondistressed couples.
Reciprocity. Table 6 presents the results of
the reciprocity analyses. Reciprocity variables
did not discriminate between distressed and
nondistressed couples. In addition, the one
significant positive reciprocity effect of Study
1 was not replicated.
The results of these two studies must bring
into question the current marriage counseling
image of positive reciprocity as characteristic
of nondistressed marriages and not characteristic of distressed marriages. The high base
rate of behavior that is positively coded by
observers or by spouses may seem to be
equivalent to reciprocity, but it is not. The
data from the present investigation support
a "bank account" model of nondistressed marriage rather than a reciprocity model. In a
bank account model, a nondistressed marriage
differs from a distressed marriage in that there
are more positive "deposits" than negative
"withdrawals." In a nondistressed marriage
the consequent positive impact codes are not
contingent upon the spouse's antecedent coding. Perhaps it is precisely this lack of reciprocity in a context of high positive exchange that characterizes stable positive interaction in nondistressed couples.

GOTTMAN, NOTARIUS, MARKMAN, BANK, YOPPI, AND RUBIN

The results of the present investigation have
demonstrated the usefulness of the talk table
as a means for operationalizing behavior exchange theory. Results obtained are generally
consistent with more expensive coding studies.
Furthermore, the power of variables obtained
by the couple coding their own behavior to
discriminate between distressed and nondistressed couples is somewhat greater than that
obtained by observer-coding studies. This result may have some theoretical import. Perhaps the differences between observer and
spouse coding could account for some of
the unreliability inherent in present coding
systems. If one observer focuses on the
facial expressions of the sender of a message,
a positive code could result from a reading of intention; if the other coder focuses
on the message's impact on the receiver, a
negative code could result from a reading of
the impact of the message. It would be fruitful to control the cues that observers use and
to study those instances when observers and
spouses are discrepant. This would be one way
to study the development of a private message
system in close relationships in which many
messages do not mean to the stranger what
they do to the person for whom they were intended. Work along these lines is in progress
in our laboratory.
One limitation of the present investigation
deserves mention. Because of the arrangements with referring agencies and the nature
of the advertisement, both couples and interviewers were aware of which couples were
seeking or starting marriage counseling. The
MRI scores were, however, not available to
either the interviewers or the eouples. This
aspect of the design of the present investigation introduces an experimenter expectancy
criticism and the possibility that couples may
be presenting themselves in order to be consistent with their classification. Subsequent
investigations could improve on the current
procedures by advertising for couples without
recruiting couples from therapeutic agencies.
Couples could be split on MRI scores, and the
interviewers could remain blind to a couple's
classification. Such a procedure, however, may
draw different samples of couples than the
present investigation, which used a convergence of two definitions of marital distress.
