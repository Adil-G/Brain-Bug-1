ABSTRACT
We examine multi!period observation and selection problems with an unknown
number of applicants in which applicants are interviewed one at a time on each
period\ recall of applicants that were interviewed and rejected is not possible\ the
decision on each period to reject or accept an applicant is based on relative ranks\
and the objective is to maximize the probability of accepting the top!ranked
applicant[ We propose and then assess the e.ciency of three descriptive models
by simulation\ and then test them competitively in a computer!controlled exper!
iment[ A cuto} decision model\ in which the _rst r−0 applicants are rejected and
then the _rst applicant who is ranked higher than all previously observed applicants
is accepted\ outperforms the two other two models[ Compared with the optimal
policy\ subjects stop the search too early[ Their behavior is accounted for by a
cuto} model that postulates an endogenous cost of search[ Copyright Þ 1999

in a random order[ Time is assumed to be discrete and the value of n is assumed to be known[ At any
period\ the DM can rank order all the items that have already been observed in terms of their quality\
desirability\ or attractiveness[ As each item is observed\ one on each period\ the DM must either accept
it\ in which case the search process terminates\ or reject it\ in which case the next item in the randomly
determined order "provided it is not the last item# is presented and observed[ Because the number of
items is _nite\ the search terminates either when the DM accepts an item or when the nth item is
inspected\ whichever comes _rst[ The DM|s objective is to maximize the probability that the item
accepted is\ in fact\ the best[
One of the attractive features of this decision task\ that enhances its applicability\ is that it makes no
distributional assumptions] the DM is assumed to possess no prior information about the distribution of
quality\ desirability\ or attractiveness of the items[ In most practical sequential search problems DMs
do not possess accurate information about such distributions^ distributional assumptions are more
often made to simplify model construction and achieve mathematical tractability rather than re~ect
reality[ Since the only information she receives is about the relative ranks of the items already inspected\
the DM cannot learn the characteristics of this distribution during the search[ A second attractive
feature is that because the payo} function is of the 9!0 type\ assigning a payo} of 0 if the best item is
accepted "success# and 9 otherwise "failure#\ no considerations of utility are required[ A third attractive
feature is the generalizability of the model to account for weakening of the constraints imposed on the
original search problem[
Using the context of personnel selection * the one actually used as a cover story in our experiment *
the SSP can be formulated in terms of the following six assumptions]
"0# There is only a single position to be _lled[
"1# The number of applicants\ n\ is _nite and known to the DM before the search starts[
"2# The n applicants are interviewed\ one at a time\ in a random order[ "Consequently\ before search
commences\ each of the n; orders is equally likely[#
"3# The DM can rank order all the n applicants in terms of their quality from best to worst with no
ties[ Her decision to either accept or reject an applicant on a given period only depends on the
relative rank of the applicant with respect to all the applicants that have already been interviewed[
"4# Once rejected\ an applicant cannot later be recalled[
"5# The DM receives a payo} of 0\ if she accepts the best applicant\ and 9\ otherwise[
Although these assumptions capture important characteristics of the observation and selection
problem\ it was recognized quite early "e[g[ Gilbert and Mosteller\ 0855# that they place more con!
straints on the observation and selection problem than would generally apply in practice[ In an attempt
to render the model more realistic\ many theoretical articles have appeared in the last 24 years or so
relaxing or otherwise modifying one or more of the assumptions stated above "see Freeman\ 0872\ for
an early review#[ The focus of this growing body of literature has been on characterizing the optimal
policy and providing routines for solving it numerically[ There have been hardly any attempts to assess
the sensitivity of the optimal solutions to deviations from optimality nor to compare these solutions
to descriptive models that may better account for actual behavior in this class of optimal stopping
problems[ Our study departs from this tradition by proposing alternative descriptive models of optimal
stopping and then testing them experimentally in the laboratory[ When studied experimentally\ the
SSP and its di}erent variants can provide information that may partially help to understand behavior
in more realistic sequential search problems "e[g[ purchasing a used car\ hiring a secretary#[
PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
There have been numerous experimental studies of optimal stopping or sequential search\ most of
them violating one or more assumptions of the SSP[ In particular\ almost all these studies have made

strong distributional assumptions that\ we contend\ are seldom realized in practice and whose validity
is very di.cult to ascertain experimentally[ It is quite one thing to instruct the subjects that the items
to be observed and inspected are sequentially and randomly drawn from a distribution "e[g[ normal#
with prespeci_ed and known parameters\ and yet another to assume that inexperienced subjects "or
even experienced DMs# can assess the density of a given observation and compare it to a cuto} point
which she is supposed to know how to calculate[ Kahan\ Rapoport and Jones "0869# investigated
sequential search behavior in a task satisfying all but one of the assumptions of the SSP[ In violation
of Assumption "3# above\ the subject recorded the actual value of the item he inspected rather than
the relative rank of this item with respect to the items already observed and rejected[ Therefore\
although information about the distribution of item quality was not explicitly provided at the outset\
it could be gradually acquired during the task[ Corbin\ Olson and Abbondanza "0864# also violated
Assumption "3# above by providing their subjects information about the numerical values of the stimuli
rather than about their relative ranks "see also Corbin\ 0879#[ They reported that this information\ in
fact\ was not ignored but rather manipulated by their subjects in order to lend structure to a seemingly
complex task[ In yet another study of optimal stopping\ Rapoport and Tversky "0869# explicitly
provided their subjects complete information about the distribution of item quality and assumed in
their analysis of the data that this information was understood\ perfectly coded\ and operated upon
by their subjects[ Kogut "0889# proceeded in the same way[
In contrast\ in a follow!up study\ Corbin "0865\ unpublished manuscript# eliminated irrelevant
distributional information[ At each period of the inspection her subjects could only learn whether the
current alternative was the maximum of the alternatives already inspected or not[ Another study that
fully implemented the assumptions of the SSP was conducted by Seale and Rapoport "0886#[ They
implemented the requirement of no distributional assumptions about the quality of the items "pro!
_ciency of applicants interviewed for a job# by telling their subjects on each period of the task the
ranks of all the alternatives\ including the current one\ that have already been observed[ In particular\
no information about the actual quality scores of the alternatives was provided[ A major _nding of
Seale and Rapoport was that\ compared to the optimal policy\ their subjects stopped the search too
early[
The present study is part of a programmatic research aimed to study more realistic versions of
sequential search[ The major goal of this program is to systematically relax di}erent assumptions\ or
combinations of assumptions\ that characterize the SSP "in particular\ Assumptions "0#\ "1#\ "4#
and "5## in order to gain better understanding of sequential search behavior with no distributional
information[ The present study extends previous research "Corbin\ 0865\ unpublished manuscript^
Seale and Rapoport\ 0886# by focusing on the case where the number of applicants is no longer known
with precision[0 This is accomplished by replacing Assumption "1# above with the following assumption]
"1?# The number of applicants is _nite but unknown[ The DM only has an a!priori distribution on the
actual number of applicants available[
We shall refer to the secretary problem that satis_es Assumptions "0#\ "1?#\ "2#\ "3#\ "4# and "5# as the
secretary problem with uncertainty "SPU#[
Although more realistic than the SSP\ the SPU is still an abstraction that may fail to capture some

applicants is known with precision is quite limiting[ The learning set in the SSP\ which is central to the optimal policy\ is de_ned
as a proportion of the number of items available[ Accurate knowledge of this number is thus a prerequisite for using the results[
However\ in many applications\ {this number may not even be known within an order of magnitude| "Stewart\ 0870\ p[ 021#[

of the features of sequential personnel selection problems[1 However\ we argue that an experimental
investigation of the SPU may provide insight about the type of decision policies that DMs use when
faced with the choice between committing to an attractive proposition or deferring their decision in the
hope of obtaining a better proposition when they are uncertain about the total number of propositions
available[ A comparison of optimal stopping behavior under conditions of certainty "SSP# and uncer!
tainty "SPU# may also help to determine whether the tendency to stop the search too early * a general
_nding of most of the experimental studies of sequential search under certainty * extends to the
sequential search problem under uncertainty[
The rest of the paper is organized as follows[ We _rst characterize the optimal policy\ and then
present three alternative descriptive models and compare their performance to that of the optimal
policy via simulation[ Following the theoretical section\ we present and discuss the results of an
experiment designed to study sequential search behavior and compare to one another the descriptive
power of the three models[ A major _nding of our study is that\ similarly to the SSP\ subjects in the
SPU stop the search too early[ In the _nal section we account for this _nding by postulating a decision
model incorporating endogenous cost of search[

ALTERNATIVE DECISION RULES
The optimal policy
The state of the decision process at each period "stage# can be described by two integers "r^ s#\ where r
is the number of applicants so far presented and s is the relative rank of the rth\ last presented applicant[
In both the SSP and SPU\ if s × 0\ there is obviously no point in accepting the rth item\ as it cannot
possibly be the best[ If s  0\ an event that must occur at least once "necessarily\ if r  0\ then s  0#\
we say that this applicant is a candidate for acceptance[
The SSP has a remarkably simple solution]
{Reject the _rst r−0 applicants and then accept the _rst applicant thereafter that is better than all
previously observed applicants[|
Stated di}erently\ the optimal policy for the SSP is of a cutoff form\ where the _rst r−0 applicants
are rejected "or passed by# and the _rst candidate\ if any\ is accepted thereafter[ What is also remarkable
is that as n : \ r:n : 0:e"0:e  9[257#\ and the probability of accepting the best applicant also
approaches 0:e[ Thus\ for a large n\ it is approximately optimal to wait until 26) of the applicants
have been interviewed and then accept the next relatively best one[ The probability of success if the
optimal policy is used is about 26)[ Moreover\ as shown by the numerical results reported by Gilbert
and Mosteller "0855#\ convergence to 0:e is quick[ For example\ r:n is equal to 9[3\ 9[3\ 9[3\ and 9[264
for n  09\ 19\ 39\ and 79\ respectively[ The corresponding probabilities of success are 9[2876\ 9[2731\
9[2646\ and 9[2608[
To compute r\ let `"r^ n# denote the probability of success using a cuto} decision rule[ Then\

We are presently in the process of studying a version of the {secretary problem| that replaces Assumption "4# with the assumption
that\ once rejected\ an applicant can be recalled\ and that the probability of its availability decreases as the number of applicants
since it was last observed increases[ See also the third study of Seale "0885\ unpublished manuscript# that modi_es Assumption
"5# by counting as success the selection of either the best or second!best overall applicant[

When there is uncertainty about the value of n and only its distribution is assumed to be known\ the
form of the optimal policy is no longer so simple[ However\ Presman and Sonin "0861# show that in
three special cases\ where the distribution of the number of applicants is either uniform\ geometrical\
or Poisson\ the optimal policy assumes its standard cuto} form\ where the _rst r−0 applicants are
rejected and the _rst candidate\ if any\ is accepted thereafter[ Both the values of r and the associated
probability of success di}er from the corresponding values for the SSP[ In particular\ assume that
at most n applicants are available for interviewing\ and that the DM has an a!priori probability
distribution pm  P"M  m# on the actual number M of applicants available\ where
p0 ¦p1 ¦= = =¦pn  0[ If the distribution on M is uniform between 0 and n\ as we assume in the present

distributed between 0 and n\ and n is quite large\ it is approximately optimal to wait until 02[4)
"rather than 26) in the SSP# of the maximum number of applicants have been interviewed and then
select the next relatively best one[ The probability of success in this case is 1:e1[ Moreover\ as shown
by the numerical results reported by Rasmussen and Robbins "0864#\ convergence in the SPU is also
reached rather rapidly[ For example\ r:n is equal to 9[1\ 9[04\ 9[04\ and 9[0264 for n  09\ 19\ 39\

The optimal solution for the SPU is used as a benchmark for assessing the e.ciency of the subjects|
decisions in our experiment\ not as a model describing their behavior[ For this purpose\ we com!
petitively test three descriptive models that were originally proposed in the previous study of Seale and
Rapoport to account for search behavior in the simpler SSP[ Whereas these models all share the same
assumption that the mental process of reaching a decision takes the form of counting "see Busemeyer
and Rapoport\ 0877#\ they di}er from one another in the events that are supposed to be counted[ The
_rst model assumes that all applicants are being counted\ the second that only candidates are being
counted\ and the third that only successive non!candidates are being counted[ Because these decision
rules make no use of knowledge of the maximum number of applicants to be observed\ they are equally
applicable to the SSP and SPU[ We describe these three models below and then assess their e.ciency
through computer simulations[

A cutoff rule
Under this decision rule\ the DM is supposed to reject the _rst r−0 applicants and then accept the
next top!ranked applicant "candidate#[ This decision rule places minimal demands on the DM|s
cognitive ability[ It only requires her to keep count of the number of applicants she observes\ and then
stop on the _rst candidate thereafter once this number exceeds some constant r−0\ a parameter of the
model[ The cuto} decision rule includes the optimal policy as a special case when r  r\ but
generalizes it to non!optimal cuto} values[ The probability of success under this rule can be computed
directly from equation "3#[

A candidate counting rule
Under this decision rule\ the subject is assumed to keep count only of the number of candidates she
observes and stop the search once this number is equal to or larger than some constant j"0 ¾ j ¾ n#\ a
parameter of the model[ Whereas the former cuto} rule focuses on the number of successive applicants
that have been interviewed\ ignoring the number of candidates within the _rst r−0 periods\ the
candidate counting rule ignores the number of applicants but\ rather\ focuses only on the number of
candidates[

A successive non!candidate counting rule
Under this decision rule\ the DM accepts the _rst candidate who follows at least k consecutive non!
candidates\ where 9 ¾ k ¾ n−0 is a parameter of the model[ Similarly to the candidate counting rule\
the present decision rule assumes that counting starts when the _rst candidate is observed[ However\
it is the number of consecutive non!candidates rather than number of candidates that the subject is
assumed to count\ with a new counting starting whenever a new candidate is observed[
All the three decision rules are considerably simpler in the assumptions they make about the cognitive
operations conducted by the subject than other decision rules that have been proposed to account for
choice behavior in deferred decision making "Busemeyer and Rapoport\ 0877#[ All three assume a
single counter but di}er from one another in the events that are supposed to be counted "applicants\
candidates\ successive non!candidates#[ Implicit in these decision rules is the dependency of the par!
ameters r\ j\ and k on the value of n[ One would expect each of these parameters to increase in n[ To
the extent that subjects adhere to one or more of these decision rules\ we shall attempt to determine
this dependency from their decisions[ Because each decision rule is characterized by a single parameter
only "for a given n#\ a straightforward statistical comparison of the rules\ not entangled by the
di}erences in the number of free parameters\ is possible[

Simulation results
The e.ciency of each of the decision rules was assessed by computer simulation[ Each of the three
decision rules was examined with a SPU of either n  39 or n  019\ the parameter values actually
used in the experiment[ Although these two values of n may be too large to characterize most sequential
search problems in practice\ we chose them for a very good reason[ Later we estimate the parameters
r\ j\ and k from subjects| actual decisions[ To estimate these values with precision\ the parameter n
must be set at a relatively high value[
All the simulations followed the same pattern[ First\ a value of M was chosen from the set of integers
"0\ 1\ [ [ [ \ n# with probability P"M  m#  0:n[ Second\ the integers "applicants# 0 through M were
arranged in a random order\ and then presented to the decision rule one at a time[ Finally\ if the
applicant was a candidate and the criterion of the model was satis_ed\ the candidate was chosen^

otherwise\ another applicant was observed[ If the candidate chosen had the highest rank in the set of
M applicants\ a correct selection "success# was registered[ The values of the decision rule|s single
parameter were varied systematically\ with each value being replicated 09\999 times[
Several statistics were computed for each decision rule[ The most obvious statistic is the number of
correct selections "which yields the probability of success when divided by 09\999#[ This statistic allows
assessment of the decision rule for an appropriate choice of its parameter value[ Another\ less obvious\
statistic is the total number of selections made which\ when divided by 09\999\ yields the probability
of candidate selection[ We are interested in this statistic because\ in addition to maximizing the
probability of success\ some subjects in our experiment might have preferred to stop the search without
choosing the top!tanked applicant rather than complete the search without ever stopping[2
Exhibit 0 provides a summary of the simulation results[ It reports four statistics for each of the three
decision rules[ The _rst statistic\ called the optimal threshold\ is the parameter value of the decision
rule under consideration "r\ j\ or k# that produces the highest probability of success[ In agreement with
the theoretical results for the optimal policy\ the optimal threshold "r# values for the cuto} rule are
5 and 05 for n  39 and n  019\ respectively[ The second statistic is the probability of candidate
selection associated with the optimal threshold[ It is the probability that the decision rule stops and
accepts some candidate[ For the cuto} rule\ these probabilities assume the values 9[511 and 9[527 for
n  39 and n  019\ respectively[ The third statistic is the probability of success associated with the
optimal threshold[ In complete agreement with the numerical results reported by Rasmussen and
Robbins "0864#\ the probabilities of success associated with r  r are 9[189 and 9[168\ respectively[
The fourth statistic\ called ef_ciency\ is obtained by dividing the probability of success associated with
the optimal threshold for a given decision rule by the probability of success of the optimal policy[
Clearly\ the e.ciency of the cuto} rule with r  r is 099)\ whereas those of the other two decision
2
The probability of success associated with the cuto} decision rule can be computed directly from equation "3#[ Because we do
not have an explicit expression for computing the probability of accepting some candidate\ not necessarily the top!ranked
applicant\ we reverted to simulations[

stopping too early is more costly than stopping too late[ Two other very simple decision rules\ one
focusing on the number of candidates and the other on the number of non!candidates\ emerge as viable
alternatives to the cuto} rule for describing actual search behavior[ This is particularly the case for the
latter decision rule\ which achieves almost the same probability of success as the optimal policy for the
two values of n that we have investigated[
Having assessed the sensitivity of the optimal solution for the SPU and the e.ciencies of the three
decision rules\ we conducted an experiment aimed to compare actual and optimal sequential search
behavior and competitively test the three descriptive models[

METHOD
Subjects
Fifty subjects participated in the experiment[ They were recruited by advertisements asking for vol!
unteers to participate in a computer!controlled experiment concerning personnel selection decisions
with payo} contingent on performance[ The subjects consisted of undergraduate students\ graduate
students\ and a few university employees[ They were randomly assigned to two conditions\ with 14
subjects participating in Condition L "n  39# and 14 in Condition H "n  019#[

Procedure
Subjects arrived at the laboratory in groups of six to eight and were seated in separate rooms equipped
with PCs[ The instructions "provided both online and hard copy# explained the SPU task with particular
emphasis on how the relative ranks change as a new applicant is observed "see Seale\ 0885\ unpublished
manuscript\ for instructions to the subjects#[ A sample exercise was designed to test the subjects|
understanding of the instructions[ Once the subjects completed this exercise\ they summoned the
experimenter who checked the results of the exercise and answered questions about the task\ if any[
Each subject completed 099 independent trials "replications# of the SPU[ Each trial consisted of a
number of periods equal to or smaller than M[ Each period had the same structure[ The relative rank\
s\ of the current applicant was displayed "s  0\ if r  0#[ The subject could either accept the applicant
or move to the next period[ If she decided to move\ the computer updated and then displayed the ranks
of all the applicants that had been observed in the order they had been observed[ For example\ after
observing three applicants\ the relative ranks that could have been displayed were either "0\ 1\ 2#\
"0\ 2\ 1#\ "1\ 0\ 2#\ "1\ 2\ 0#\ "2\ 0\ 1#\ or "2\ 1\ 0#[ Information about the quality score of the applicant was
never provided[ This process continued until either the subject stopped the observation and selection
process by accepting an applicant or after observing M applicants\ whichever came _rst[
At the end of each trial\ the computer revealed the rankings of all the M applicants and informed
the subject of the absolute "not relative# rank of the applicant she had accepted[ If the applicant
accepted by the subject was the top ranked\ the subject was paid ,9[29 for the trial^ otherwise\ she was
not paid at all[ The cumulative earnings were displayed at the top of the computer screen[
The subjects were instructed that the actual number of applicants\ M\ was drawn randomly and
independently on each trial and could assume any value between 0 and n "n  39 or 019# with equal
probability[
After completing 099 trials\ the subjects were asked to answer a brief post!experimental questionnaire

that requested them to rate the importance of _ve factors "see below# in their hiring decisions and
describe in detail the strategy they used to select candidates[ To motivate thoughtful answers\ the
subjects were instructed that they would play one _nal trial\ worth ,1[99 for a success\ which would
use the decision rule they just described in the questionnaire[ Following this _nal trial\ the subjects
were paid their cumulative earnings\ informally debriefed\ and dismissed from the laboratory[ The
mean time to complete the experiment was 49 and 54 minutes for Conditions L and H\ respectively[

RESULTS
Subjects in Condition L completed a total of 1499 "14×099# trials\ selected some candidate on 0799
trials "61[9)#\ observed all the applicants without stopping the search on 581 trials "16[6)#\ and
selected non!candidates on only eight occasions[ Overall\ the subjects succeeded in choosing the top!
ranked applicant on 507 trials "13[6)#^ this percentage is signi_cantly smaller "t13  4[38\ p ³ 9[990#
than the predicted value of 17[8) under the optimal policy[ Across all the 14 subjects\ the mode of
the "inferred\ best _tting# cuto} values was 4\ indicating that the reduction of 3 percentage points in
the probability of success is attributed to a tendency to stop the search too early[ The summary results
for Condition H are similar[ The subjects selected some candidate on 0734 out of 1499 trials "62[7)#\
observed all the applicants without ever stopping the search on 515 trials "14[9)#\ succeeded in
selecting the best applicant on 417 trials "10[0)#\ and selected a non!candidate on only 18 occasions[
The overall percentage of success computed across the 14 subjects is smaller "t13  09[01\ p ³ 9[990#
than the optimal value of 16[8)[ The mode of the distribution of cuto} values was 6 rather than 05
suggesting again that the non!optimal behavior in Condition H was due to a general tendency to stop
the observation and selection process too early[
The number of trials on which a non!candidate was selected was 7 "9[2)# in Condition L and 18
"0[1)# in Condition H[ Examination of individual results indicates that in almost all the cases the
subject selected a non!candidate after having observed more than n:1 applicants[ Additionally\ in both
the present study of the SPU and the previous study of the SSP more than 69) of the trials where a
non!candidate was selected occurred in the high n condition "n  79 in Seale and Rapoport and
n  019 in the present study#[ Rather than attributing these non!optimal decisions to errors due to a
choice of the wrong key\ we conclude that they are part of a deliberate strategy by some of the subjects
to {give up| on the current trial\ thereby saving precious time[ Because our primary focus is on
comparison of the decision rules introduced earlier\ subsequent analyses will omit trials on which a
non!candidate was selected[

Model comparison
Unless the subject is directly asked about the decision rule she used\ there is no obvious way to infer
the rule from her responses on any particular trial[ Even if we assume that the subject adheres to one
of the three rules we proposed earlier\ there is no way to determine the exact value of the model|s
single parameter from her responses[ For example\ supposing that M  8 applicants were chosen in
Condition L\ with quality values ranging between 1 "lowest# and 29 "highest#\ and presented to the
Dm in the following order] 4\ 04\ 2\ 1\ 17\ 29\ 00\ 6\ 03[ Supposing that the DM actually stopped and
selected the _fth applicant\ who is a candidate "s  0#[ This response is consistent with a cuto} rule
where 1 ³ r ¾ 4\ a candidate counting rule where j  1\ and a successive non!candidate counting rule
where 0 ¾ k ¾ 1[ It is also consistent with other decision rules that we have not speci_ed[ In the same
example\ if the subject does not stop the search\ her response is consistent with a cuto} rule where
6 ³ r\ a candidate counting rule where 2 ³ j\ and a successive non!candidate counting rule where

1 ³ k[ Interrogating the subject during the trial about the decision rule\ if any\ that she used could bias
her future behavior[ Interrogating her after all the 099 trials have been completed\ as we did in the
present study\ presumes a perfect memory on the part of the subject[
Rather than attempting to infer the particular decision rule or rules that the subject might have used
during the experiment\ we focused on the three decision rules * or descriptive models * introduced
earlier and proceeded to test them competitively[ For each decision rule\ we _xed the value of its single
parameter "r\ j\ or k# and then counted the number of trials\ out of 099\ consistent with this value[ By
varying the value of the parameter and repeating the procedure for each possible value\ we constructed
for each subject separately an empirical distribution of the frequency of trials consistent with this
decision rule[ The mode of this distribution was then chosen to represent the maximum number of
decisions consistent with this decision rule for a speci_c value of its parameter\ and the three decision
rules were then compared to one another in terms of this single frequency[ This comparison was
conducted separately for each of the subjects[
Exhibit 4 presents the parameter values of the three decision rules inferred from the subject|s decision
across all the 099 trials in Condition L[ The exhibit shows the modal result3 and the proportion of
3
Even with 099 iterations of the task\ for each decision rule it is possible to get multi!modal results[ These ae indicated in the
exhibit[ For example\ 57) of the decisions of Subject 1 can be accounted for by a cuto} decision rule with either r  4 or r  6[

decisions "trials# consistent with that result for each decision rule and each subject separately[ For
example\ 79) of the decisions of Subject 0 were consistent with a cuto} decision rule with the cuto}
value set at r  3\ 59) with a candidate counting rule with j set at 2\ and 61) with a successive non!
candidate counting rule with k set at 0[ By comparing across the three decision rules\ it is apparent
that the decisions of Subject 0 are most consistent with the cuto} decision rule of r  3[ By repeating
these comparisons across the subjects\ it is possible to determine which of the three rules accounts for
the behavior of more subjects[ It is also possible to determine for each decision rule separatley the
empirical distribution of the values of its single parameter[
Exhibit 4 shows that the values of r inferred from the individual decisions ranged between 2 and 6\
and that the corresponding proportions of decisions accounted for by the cuto} rule varied from 9[42
to 9[70[ The inferred values of j for the candidate counting rule varied between 1 and 3\ with the
proportions of decisions consistent with this model ranging between 9[25 and 9[59[ For the successive
non!candidate counting rule\ the inferred values of k ranged between 0 and 3\ and the corresponding
proportions of decisions varied between 9[31 and 9[62[ The cuto} rule accounted for the highest
proportion of decisions for 10 of the 14 subjects^ the successive non!candidate accounted for the highest
proportion of decisions in 3 cases^ and the candidate counting rule never accounted for the greatest
proportion of decisions[
Focusing on the cuto} rule\ Exhibit 4 shows that 3 of the 12 subjects with a single mode established
their cuto} at r  r  5\ whereas 07 of the 08 remaining subjects established it at a lower value[ A
two!sided sign test rejected the hypothesis "m  08\ p ³ 9[90# that equal proportions of subjects either
stopped the search too early or too late[
Exhibit 5 shows the same results for Condition H[ Individual modal values for r ranged between 3
and 07\ and the corresponding proportions of decisions accounted for by the cuto} rule ranged between
9[27 and 9[81[ For the candidate counting rule\ modal values of j varied between 1 and 4\ with
corresponding proportions of decisions consistent with the model varying from 9[29 to 9[43[ Finally\
for the successive non!candidate counting rule\ the modal values of k ranged between 0 and 7\ and the
proportions of decisions consistent with this model varied between 9[21 and 9[61[ Like Condition L\
the cuto} decision rule accounted for the highest proportion of decisions in all 14 cases[ With 13 of
the 14 subjects in Condition H setting their cuto} values smaller than r  05\ it is again evident that
relative to the optimal policy the subjects stopped too early[

Learning effects
The analyses reported in the previous section are based on the assumption that the same decision rule
with the same parameter value was used consistently across the 099 trials[ This assumption precludes
the possibility of switching between decision rules or\ even more plausibly\ for the same decision rule
changing its parameter value across trials[ Learning across trials might be expressed by the decision
rule approaching the optimal policy or by the subject becoming more consistent in using the same
decision rule[ To test for learning e}ects\ we divided the 099 trials into two blocks of 49 trials each\
and then compared the two blocks to each other in terms of the mean of the inferred value of r and
the proportion of decisions consistent with the cuto} rule[ Whereas a similar analysis conducted by
Seale and Rapoport yielded signi_cant learning e}ects with the mean inferred value of r moving closer
to r and the proportion of decision consistent with the cuto} rule increasing over blocks\ we found
no such evidence for the SPU "see Seale\ 0885\ unpublished manuscript\ for details#[ For both conditions
L and H\ none of the comparisons of Blocks 0 and 1 yielded signi_cant di}erences[
We repeated the same analysis with smaller blocks of 14 trials each\ and then compared to each
other all "5# pairwise combinations of two blocks[ For Condition L\ the modal cuto} points increased
across the four blocks from 3 in Block 0\ through 4 in Blocks 1 and 2\ to 5 in Block 3[ However\ only

the comparison between Blocks 2 and 3 was signi_cant] the inferred cuto} points of 03 of the 14
subjects signi_cantly increased from Block 2 to 3 "two!tailed sign test\ m  08\ p ³ 9[90#[ Exactly the
opposite trend was revealed in Condition H] the modal cuto} points decreased across the four blocks
from 09 in Block 0\ through 7 and 6 in Blocks 1 and 2\ to 6 in Block 3[ However\ only the comparison
between Blocks 0 and 1 was signi_cant] the inferred cuto} points of 04 of the 14 subjects signi_cantly
decreased from Block 0 to 1[ We judge these learning trends to be too weak to be conclusive[
The comparisons of Blocks 0 and 1 conducted above are model dependent[ It is possible that the
probability of success increases with experience even when the subject uses one of the three decision
rules with a parameter value which is not _xed for all 49 trials or some other decision rule that di}ers
from the three that we have tested[ To account for this possibility\ we calculated for each subject the
proportion of successes in each of the two blocks of 49 trials and across the two blocks[ As in most
previous analyses\ this analysis\ too\ was conducted on the individual level[ The individual proportions
are presented in Exhibit 6[
Across all the 099 trials\ the proportions of success for Condition L ranged between 9[06 and 9[22
with a mean of 9[14 and standard deviation of 9[927[ The means and standard deviations assumed the
values 9[15 and 9[938 for block 0 and 9[12 and 9[937 for block 1[ The di}erence between these means

The mean ratings of factors 0\ 1\ 2\ 3\ and 4 in Condition L were 4[4\ 1[8\ 1[9\ 4[1\ and 4[5\ respectively[
A repeated!measures ANOVA rejected the null hypothesis of equality in means "F3\85  31[71\
p ³ 9[990#\ and a Tukey HSD test indicated a signi_cant di}erence between the means of factors 0\ 3\
and 4 and the means of factors 1 and 2[ Information that was not relevant to the three decision rules
was\ indeed\ rated as signi_cantly and substantially less important[ We found no di}erences between
the mean ratings of factors 0\ 3\ and 4[ Whereas 05) of the subjects reported using a cuto} rule
exclusively\ no subject reported using any of the two other decision rules[ Rather\ the majority of the
subjects "45)# reported using decision rules combinin` in one way or another both the number of
applicants and the number of candidates encountered[ In general\ the combination rules were not
stated very clearly and seemed to vary across subjects[ As the mean ratings of factors 0 through 4 in
Condition H are essentially the same\ they are omitted[
In addition to answering the _ve questions above\ the subjects were asked to estimate the number
of successes they would have scored in 099 additional trials\ if the number of applicants were to be
uniformly distributed between "0# 0 and 39\ "1# 0 and 79\ and "2# 0 and 019[ Recall that the subjects
in Condition L only experienced the case of n  39 whereas the subjects in Condition H only experi!
enced the case of n  019[ Thus\ all the 49 subjects were presented with one case "either n  39 or
n  019# they have already experienced for 099 trials and with two new cases\ albeit di}erent from one
condition to another\ that they have not experienced at all[
The mean estimates of number of successes are depicted in Exhibit 7[ The solid line represents the
mean estimates of the subjects in Condition L\ and the dashed line the mean estimates of the subjects
in Condition H[ The solid and empty triangle markers show the actual mean number of successes in
Conditions L and H\ respectively[ The individual estimates were subjected to a 1×2 condition by value

Condition L for all three values of n[ The second main e}ect suggests that the subjects in both
conditions failed to appreciate the asymptotic probability of success associated with the optimal policy\
expecting their probability of success to decline by approximately 09) as n increased from 39 to 019[
Exhibit 7 also shows that\ after completing 099 trials\ the subjects in both conditions estimated that
their probability of success would have been higher than the observed success probabilities "denoted
in Exhibit 7 by the solid and empty triangle markers#\ if they were given the opportunity to play the
game for 099 additional periods[ The subjects in Condition L estimated that the mean number of
successes would increase\ on average\ from 13[5 "solid triangle marker# to 29[1\ beyond what one
would expect using the optimal policy[ Similarly\ the subjects in Condition H were equally optimistic\
estimating that their number of successes would increase from 10[1 "empty triangle marker# to 15[7\
an estimate that matches exactly the probability of success under the optimal policy[ The results of
paired t!tests indicate that both di}erences are signi_cant "t13  3[00\ p ³ 9[990 and t13  2[04\ p ³ 9[90
for Conditions L and H\ respectively#[

Stopping too early
Our previous comparison of the three decision rules shows that the cuto} rule accounts for more
decisions than the two other decision rules[ Additionally\ a comparison of the inferred cuto} values
with the optimal cuto} values shows that almost all the subjects in both conditions stopped the
observation and selection process too early[ Because of the insensitivity of the optimal policy to small
deviations from r\ the degree of which can be assessed from the simulation results depicted in Exhibit
1\ stopping too early caused only a small decrease in the probability of success[ Nevertheless\ this
consistent bias\ which was also reported in our previous study of the SSP\ warrants an explanation[
Seale and Rapoport hypothesized that stopping too early in the SSP resulted from the existence of
an endo`enous cost of search[ As the payo} in our experiment was contingent on performance\ rather
than on the amount of time spent in the laboratory\ it is natural to assume that if they considered time
taken to observe the applicants as an implicit search cost\ the subjects might have been motivated to
maximize their expected payo} per unit time[ This hypothesis is also applicable to the SPU[ It is
consistent with the behavior of some of our subjects who stopped the search on a non!candidate after
observing only a small number of applicants[ It is also supported by the literature on the accuracyÐ
e}ort trade!o} reported by Payne\ Bettman and Johnson "0882#[ Seale and Rapoport hypothesized a
_xed cost per observation\ and then showed that with a _xed observation cost worth 0) of the payo}
for success they could account for the modal value of the inferred cuto}s in the SSP with either n  39
or n  79[
In attempting to account for the _nding that almost all the subjects in the SPU stopped the search
too early\ we proceeded in a similar way by considering two alternative models for the e}ects of
endogenous cost of search[ The _rst model assumes a _xed cost per observation\ whereas the second
assumes that the di}erence between the costs of two successive observations decreases in the number
of observations[ In particular\ let E0 "r^ n# denote the expected payo} in the SPU when the DM accepts
the _rst candidate after passing r−0 applicants[ Assuming a _xed cost per observation\ the expected
payo} associated with this rule can be computed from
E0 "r^ n#  h"r^ n#"0−cr#

r  0\1\[ [ [ \n

where c "c − 9# is the endogenous cost of search and h"r^ n# is computed from equation "2#[ One can
vary c and then for each new value of c solve for the value of r\ denoted by r0  r0 "c#\ which maximizes
this expression[

Our second model assumes a cost of search that changes logarithmically in the number of obser!
vations[4 Under this model\ the expected payo} is given by
E1 "r^ n#  h"r^ n#ð0−c"lnr#Ł

r  0\1\[ [ [ \n

We shall denote the value of r that maximizes this expression for a given value of c by r1  r1 "c#[
Exhibit 8 presents the values of r0 for the cuto} model that assumes a _xed cost per observation[
Results are presented for c  9\ 9[90\ 9[91\ [ [ [ \ 9[09 and for both Conditions L and H[ For both
conditions\ if c  9 then r0  r[ For example\ Exhibit 8 shows that when the per observation
endogenous cost of search * a parameter of the model * is equal to 4) "c  9[94# of the payo} for
success\ the cuto} value that maximizes the expected payo} is reduced from 5 to 3 in Condition L and
from 06 to 5 in Condition H[
The median of the "modal# cuto} values separately inferred for each subject from his or her decisions
"see Exhibits 4 and 5# was 4 and 6 for Conditions L and H\ respectively[ Exhibit 8 shows that a cuto}
model assuming the same endogenous cost of approximately 2[4) of the payo} for success "about 0
cent# accounts for the median cuto} value in both conditions[ There are\ of course\ good reasons to
expect the per observation endogenous cost of search to vary from one individual to another\ depending
on how much each subject values the time spent in completing the task[ Exhibit 8 shows that a per!
observation search cost that varies between 9) and 09) "2 cents# of the payo} for success accounts
for the inferred cuto} values of all the 14 subjects in Condition L and all but one subject "Subject 6#
in Condition H "see Exhibits 4 and 5#[
We repeated the same analysis for the second model that assumes a logarithmically decreasing rather
than _xed cost of search[ The results do not support this model[ First\ there exists no single value of c
that simultaneously accounts for the median cuto} values under both experimental conditions[ The c
value that yields r1  4 in Condition L is 9[0\ and the one that yields r1  6 in Condition H is 9[1[
Second\ these two values of c seem to be too high to be interpreted as reasonable costs of search[

4
Other cost functions that decrease in r are possible[ We chose the logarithmic function as an example of a class of slowly
decreasing cost functions[

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In the sequential observation and selection problem considered in the present study\ the DM|s objective
is to maximize the probability of choosing the best out of n alternatives^5 the information about the
quality of the alternatives\ which is updated on every period of the search\ consists of the relative ranks
of the previously observed alternatives^ and the uncertainty about the unknown value of n is expressed
by a uniform distribution over the interval ð0\ nŁ[ Although we have interpreted this probability model
and presented it as a theory of personnel selection\ it can also apply to other sequential decision
processes[ The optimal policy for this problem is to reject the _rst r−0 alternatives\ and then accept
the _rst alternative\ which is better than all the ones previously observed[ The value of the cuto} point
r depends on the value of n[ We have assessed through simulation the sensitivity of the optimal policy
to small perturbations in r[ We have also ascertained that a simple decision rule that counts only the
number of candidates and another decision rule that counts only the number of successive non!
candidates can achieve the objective with only a small reduction in the probability of success[ This is
particularly true in case of the successive non!candidate counting decision rule whose e.ciency is
particularly high[
There is strong evidence that subjects adhere to the form of the optimal policy[ In a competitive test
of the three decision rules\ that treated all of them in exactly the same way\ the cuto} rule accounted
for more decisions than the two other decision rules[ Seale and Rapoport reported similar results in
their study of the SSP[ Although we have found no evidence for learning across blocks of trials\ it is
possible * perhaps even likely * that r varies across trials\ particularly in the beginning of the exper!
iment[ However\ because the cuto} value on each trial cannot be directly observed when alternatives
are presented in a random order\ the design of the present study does not permit testing hypotheses
about trial!to!trial changes in r\ possibly as a function of the outcomes of previous trials[ Trial!to!trial
changes in r could be measured in a di}erent design in which specially constructed sequences of
alternatives "e[g[ when all or some of the alternatives are presented in an ascending order# on some of
the trials[ This design\ however\ violates a basic assumption of the secretary problem of random arrival
of applicants[
Although subjects seem to follow the cuto} rule\ our results indicate that they stop too early[ To
account for this _nding in the SSP\ Seale and Rapoport proposed to assume that the DM|s objective
is maximization of expected value per unit time of search[ In both studies we modeled this objective
by introducing an endo`enous cost of search\ using the single parameter c to control the degree of
{timeÐe}ort| trade!o}[ The combined evidence from both studies of the SSP and SPU supports a
model with a _xed endogenous cost of search\ which may vary between DMs[ The strongest evidence
in support of this explanation is that the medians of the individual cuto} points inferred from decisions
can be accounted for by a relatively small cost per observation that does not vary across conditions[
More direct tests of this explanation can be achieved by experimental studies of variants of the secretary
problem "e[g[ Corbin\ 0879^ Yang\ 0863# that explicitly introduce exogenous cost of search[
5
A natural objection to the goal of maximizing the probability of accepting the best alternative is that it implies a utility function
that takes the value 0\ if the best alterantive is selected\ and 9\ otherwise "{nothing but the best|#[ Whereas this objective may be
appropriate for certain sequential search problems\ a more realistic utility function is the one that takes the value n−i when the
ith alternative is selected[ Maximization of expected utility then corresponds to minimizing the expected rank of the accepted
alternative "Freeman\ 0872#[ This version of the secretary problem was _rst tackled by Lindley "0850# and then solved by Chow
et al[ "0853#\ who showed that asymptotically\ as n : \ the minimum expected rank is 2[76[ The optimal policy for this problem
is complicated as it depends both on the value of n and the relative ranks of the inspected alternatives[ We have no way of
determining whether the observed bias to stop the search too early might partially be explained by the argument that our
subjects were applying a decision rule that works best in sequential search situations with which they might have been more
familiar[ This issue can best be resolved by conducting sequential search experiments that explicitly incorporate this more
realistic objective[
