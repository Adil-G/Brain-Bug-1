A widely observed phenomenon in decision making under risk is the apparent overweighting of unlikely events and the underweighting
of nearly certain events. This violates standard assumptions in expected utility theory, which requires that expected utility be linear
(objective) in probabilities. Models such as prospect theory have relaxed this assumption and introduced the notion of a “probability
weighting function,” which captures the key properties found in experimental data. This study reports functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data that neural response to expected reward is nonlinear in probabilities. Specifically, we found that activity in the
striatum during valuation of monetary gambles are nonlinear in probabilities in the pattern predicted by prospect theory, suggesting that
probability distortion is reflected at the level of the reward encoding process. The degree of nonlinearity reflected in individual subjects’
decisions is also correlated with striatal activity across subjects. Our results shed light on the neural mechanisms of reward processing,
and have implications for future neuroscientific studies of decision making involving extreme tails of the distribution, where probability
weighting provides an explanation for commonly observed behavioral anomalies.

Introduction
A central question in the social and biological sciences is how the
likelihood and value of outcomes are combined to make risky
choices. For humans, these choices range widely, from voting, gambling, and buying stocks and insurance to searching for jobs and
mates. The standard approach, expected utility theory (EU), assumes that outcomes x are valued nonlinearly by a utility function
u(x), but are weighted by their objective probabilities (Savage, 1954).
There is substantial evidence in economics and decisionmaking research, however, that the hypothesis of expected utility
being linear in probabilities is systematically wrong, in a reliable
direction. This stylized fact was originally established by Maurice
Allais via the “common ratio effect” (Allais, 1953). Consider a
decision maker who prefers a sure ( p ⫽ 1) gain of $100,000 over
a coin toss ( p ⫽ 0.5) for $300,000 but who also rejects a 0.02
chance of $100,000 for a 0.01 chance of $300,000. If these choices
are consistent with choosing the gamble with the highest expected utility, the first choice implies u($100,000) ⬎
0.5u($300,000),
while
the
second
choice
implies
0.02u($100,000) ⬍ 0.01u($300,000). The two inequalities are
clearly at odds, since both sides of the second are the same as those
in the first multiplied by 0.02 (Prelec, 1998).

The common ratio pattern can be reconciled by the plausible
assumption that people apply nonlinear “decision weights” ␲( p)
to objective probabilities p, so that the ratio ␲(0.02)/␲(0.01) is
much smaller than ␲(1)/␲(0.5) (cf. Rubinstein, 1988). An inverse
S-shaped nonlinear function was first suggested experimentally
(Preston and Baratta, 1948), is a central feature of prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), and has been replicated in subsequent experimental and field studies including ours (see Fig.
1 A, B and supplemental material, available at www.jneurosci.
org). Small probabilities are typically overweighted while high
probabilities are underweighted, with a crossover point, at which
a probability is subjectively weighted by its objective value of p* ⫽
␲( p*) around 1/3 (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Kagel et al.,
1995; Prelec, 1998; Starmer, 2000).
Despite its clear relevance in a wide variety of settings, few
studies have directly studied nonlinear weighting of probabilities,
especially compared with the number of studies on risk and reward as a whole. There is much evidence that a number of brain
regions are sensitive to expected reward (or “utility”). Arguably
the most well established are dopaminergic regions such as the
striatum and midbrain structures (Knutson et al., 2001; Abler et
al., 2006; Tobler et al., 2007). However, most studies do not sample sufficiently near the probability endpoints to detect the theoretical nonlinearity. The two existing studies on probability
weighting also have not shown neural responses to probabilities
resembling the smoothly increasing function which typically fit
behavior well. Paulus and Frank (2006) focused on betweensubjects measures and found that activity in anterior cingulate
correlated with degree of nonlinearity across subjects. Berns et al.
(2008) used probabilities of shock and found a number of regions

exhibiting flat responses to probability,
but were not able to statistically reject the
null linear hypothesis. In this study, we
used a parametric design that varied the
probabilities and outcome of two gambles
in a binary choice task. Our statistical analysis focused on separating the weighted
form of expected utility into two components: a portion linear in probabilities, and
one that is nonlinear in probabilities. The
null hypothesis of EU predicts only significant responses to the linear portion. Under
the alternative hypothesis of nonlinear
weighting, we expect to find regions correlated with both the linear and nonlinear portions in a manner predicted by existing models of probability weighting.

Materials and Methods
The experimental sample was 21 subjects (11
female). Their mean (SD) age was 29.6 (7.5).
Informed consent was given through a form approved by the Internal Review Board at Caltech.
Subjects were recruited from an online bulletin
board (see supplemental material, available at
www.jneurosci.org).

Experimental paradigm
The experiment consisted of 120 self-paced trials (Fig. 2). In each trial, subjects chose between
two simple gambles, ( p1, x1) and ( p2, x2). A
gamble pays off $x with probability p and $0
otherwise. Subjects were first presented a screen
containing only ( p1, x1). This serves to isolate
the brain response evaluating ( p1, x1) without
confounding evaluation of the second gamble
( p2, x2) or the process of choice. The values of
p1 are {0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.95}, the values of
$x are {10, 20, 50, 100}, and they are combined
factorially to form 24 pairs, which are each presented five times.
On 12 randomly chosen trials (10% of the
trials), subjects were asked after the firstgamble presentation to indicate whether p1 ⬎
0.4. This was done to ensure that subjects were
paying attention to the first-gamble stimulus.
The final screen presented both the first gamble
and a second gamble, and subjects chose one of
the gambles. The probability and reward levels
of the second gamble, ( p2, x2), were varied
across trials, and were chosen so that its
weighted expected utility (see model below)
would be close to that of the first gamble, which
facilitated powerful behavioral estimation of
the relevant parameters of the experiment. At
the end of the experiment, one choice round
was randomly selected and the gamble chosen
in that round was resolved to determine the
subject’s payment. Average earnings for subjects were $21.48 ⫾ $5.49 plus the participation
fee of $20 (for more detail, see supplemental
Methods, available at www.jneurosci.org as

Behavioral analysis
A stochastic choice model was used to infer the
probability weighting function from behavior
and correlate its parametric expression with

brain activity (see supplemental Methods, available at www.jneurosci.
org as supplemental material). As in many studies on this topic, precision
is gained by assuming specific functional forms for the utility and probability weighting functions. The utility function is assumed to be a power
function u(x;␳) ⫽ x ␳, and the probability weighting function is the oneparameter Prelec weighting function ␲( p;␣) ⫽ 1/exp{{ln(1/p)} ␣} (Prelec, 1998), derived axiomatically from psychophysical principles [it is
implied if ln(1/␲( p)) is a power function of ln(1/p)]. Decision weights
and utilities are assumed to be combined linearly, U(x, p) ⫽ ␲( p, ␣)u(x,
␳) (where the zero payoff has zero utility). We chose the one-parameter
Prelec function because it fits as well as or better than other one- and twoparameter functions that were estimated from subjects’ choices (Table 1),
and having one parameter simplifies the cross-subject analysis below.

fMRI acquisition
Scans were acquired using the 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner at Caltech’s
Broad Imaging Center. Anatomical images (high-resolution, T1weighted) were acquired first. Functional (T2-weighted) images were
then acquired using the following parameters: TR ⫽ 2000 ms, TE ⫽ 40
ms, slice thickness ⫽ 4 mm, 32 slices. Horizontal slices were acquired
⬃30° clockwise of the anterior–posterior commissure (AC–PC) axis to
minimize signal dropout of the orbitofrontal cortex. The total time duration of the experiment varied because each round was self-paced.

fMRI analysis
Imaging data were preprocessed using SPM2, including, in order, slice
time correction, motion correction, coregistration, normalization to the
MNI template, and smoothing of the functional data with an 8 mm
kernel (Friston et al., 1995). Random effects analyses were done in SPM2
(Friston et al., 1995) by specifying a separate general linear model for
each subject and pooling at the second level. First all images were highpass filtered in the temporal domain (filter width 128 s) and autocorrelation of the hemodynamic responses was modeled as an AR(1) process.
In the GLM model all visual stimuli and motor responses were entered as
separate regressors that were constructed by convolving a hemodynamic
response function (hrf) with a comb of Dirac functions at the onset of
each visual stimulus or motor response. Parametric modulators were
added to the main regressors as interaction terms.
Parametric model. An event-related analysis focused on brain activity
during presentation of the first gamble. Because no information is
present regarding the second gamble, we assume brain regions correlated
with decision variables reflect reward anticipation with respect to first
gamble, rather than choice. We further make the assumption that neural
activity is approximately a linear function of the behaviorally derived
utility function (that is, we search for brain activity which resembles closely
the functions in Fig. 1A,B). A GLM is used that separates the weighting
function into two components: (1) component that is linear in p and (2) the
component that is the nonlinear deviation term ⌬( p, ␣i) ⫽ ␲( p, ␣i) ⫺ p
(Fig. 3A). Specifically, we are looking for a prospect-theoretic expected value
function that is nonlinear in p; that is, ␲( p, ␣)u(x) ⫽ p 䡠 u(x) ⫹ ⌬( p, ␣) 䡠
u(x). We assume the function u(x) is a power function x ␳, where the value of
␳ is taken from the individual behavioral estimate, and ⌬( p, ␣) ⫽ ␲( p, ␣) ⫺
p, where the mean group ␣ ⫽ 0.771 is used.
The BOLD signal during the first gamble presentation is regressed
against p 䡠 u(x) and ⌬( p, ␣) 䡠 u(x). If the expected utility (EU) null
hypothesis is an accurate approximation of valuation of risky choices,
there should be no reward-related brain regions that respond to the
deviation term ⌬( p, ␣) 䡠 u(x). If the nonlinear weighting hypothesis is an
accurate approximation, there should be reward-related brain regions

that respond equally strongly to the linear component p 䡠 u(x) and to the
nonlinear component ⌬( p, ␣) 䡠 u(x).
Nonparametric model. To see how closely activity in brain regions
correlated with the weighting function corresponds to the behaviorally
derived stylized empirical weighting function, a nonparametric method
was used. Each level of probability p was given a separate dummy variable
I( p). The relation y ⫽ ␣ ⫹ ␤i 䡠 Ii( p) 䡠 u(x) ⫹ ␧ was estimated, where y is
the BOLD response upon presentation of the first gamble, I is an indicator function for the particular level of p, and u(x) is a power function x ␳
used above. Each ␤i for the six levels of probability was then rescaled by
dividing the ␤i values for each probability level by the estimated slope for
the response to the linear probability term in the parametric regression of
activity against the linear and deviation terms. This is to take into account
the dimensionless nature of BOLD responses as well as to add a robustness check of the concordance of the relationship between the parametric
and nonparametric model.
Between-subject correlation. Next we test whether cross-subject variation in the inflection of nonlinear weighting inferred from choices is
consistent with cross-subject differences in neural activity. Intuitively,
more highly nonlinear functions will be approximated by a combination
of the linear term p and the nonlinear term ⌬( p, ␣i) ⫽ ␲( p, ␣i) ⫺ p
(shown in Fig. 3A, right) that puts more weight on the nonlinear term.
Less nonlinear functions will put less weight on the nonlinear term. A
linear-weighting subject, for example, will put no weight on the nonlinear deviation ⌬( p, ␣i) ⫽ ␲( p, ␣i) ⫺ p. This analysis exploits the helpful
fact that in the one-parameter Prelec form, all functions ␲( p, ␣i) pass
through a common value ␲(1/e) ⫽ 0. Weighting functions with ␣ ⬎ 0.77
(less inflected, more linear) will therefore be well approximated by p plus
a dampened form of the deviation curve in Figure 3A (right). Weighting
functions with ␣ ⬍ 0.77 (more inflected) will be approximated by p plus
an amplified form of the decision curve in Figure 3A.
Denote the true weighting function for subject i by ␲( p, ␣i), and the
deviations from linear weighting by ⌬( p, ␣i) ⫽ ␲( p, ␣i) ⫺ p. A brain
region that represents ␲( p, ␣i) will be significantly correlated with both
⌬( p, ␣i) and p. Using the mean inflection parameter ␣៮ ⫽ 0.77, the
theoretical relation is ␲( p, ␣) ⫽ a ⫹ b1 䡠 p ⫹ b2 䡠 ⌬( p, ␣៮ ) ⫹ e [that is,
every weight ␣ gives a weighting function that, when its values are regressed against p and ⌬( p, ␣៮ ), gives weights b1 and b2]. Fig. 4 A shows the
value of b2 that is theoretically estimated for the various values of ␣
inferred from subjects’ choices. The value of b2 is the inflection sensitivity
(compared with the benchmark group mean ␣ ⫽ 0.77) for particular values
of subject-specific ␣. Note that when ␣ ⫽ ␣៮ (a person’s ␣ equals the group
mean), b2 ⫽1, and when ␣ ⫽ 1 (a linear weighting function), b2 ⫽ 0 because
the nonlinear deviation term receives no weight. The graph shows that in
theory, lower individual values of ␣, corresponding to more inflection of the
weighting function, should lead to higher values of the b2 coefficient. That is,
more inflected functions are best approximated by a combination of the
linear term p and nonlinear deviation term (calculated using the average ␣៮ )
with a higher weight on the nonlinear deviation term.

cluded from this and all subsequent fMRI
analyses that depended on these parameter
estimates. Figure 1C plots the estimated
functional forms for all five functions and
shows that they look similar (except for
more pronounced overweighting of low
probabilities in the Prelec two-parameter
form). The two Prelec functions fit slightly
better than the others as judged by lower
negative log likelihood LL. We focused on
the one-parameter version of the Prelec
function, as it fits only slightly worse than
the two-parameter version, and permits
simpler cross-subject comparison (since
each subject’s curvature is expressed by
one parameter rather than two).

probabilities, as well as a plot of the behaviorally inferred weighting function using the group ␣ ⫽ 0.77. To adjust the raw probability weight values (which range from 0 to 1) to scale comparably
to the neural ␤, the behavioral weights were regressed against the
neural ␤ for each probability. The behavioral weights were then
multiplied by the regression slope, and the regression constant
was added, to create the adjusted values plotted in Figure 3C.
There is a clear concavity in low-probability activity and convexity in high-probability activity, and relatively equal activity for
probabilities from 0.10 to 0.80, which are also the key features of
the psychometric curves derived from behavior. The neurometrically derived BOLD signal curve looks like a more inflected expression of the psychometric curve. In particular, the behavioral
weighting function departs from the objective probabilities more
so than the I( p) neural estimates. Finally, a non-nested model
test (Cox test) rejects the linear model in favor of the nonlinear
␲( p) ( p ⬍ 0.064) and does not reject the linear model against the
␲( p) alternative ( p ⬍ 0.302) (see supplemental Methods, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). That is, the
␲( p) model contains additional explanatory power relative to the
linear model, whereas the reverse is not true. This, however, cannot
rule out other models that we have not considered, nor potential
confounds that may influence the BOLD response to anticipated
reward. Indeed, introspection of Figure 3C shows that there remains
much variation between the neurometric and psychometric curves
that are not explained by our model; the highly imperfect fit could
surely be improved by other designs and models. Future studies will
therefore be needed to explore this important issue.
Cross-subject correlation
Figure 3B presents the regions of striatum with activity during the
first gamble presentation that is significantly correlated with the
linear component p and the nonlinear component ⌬( p, ␣) and in
which the empirical coefficient on the nonlinear component (b2)
is negatively correlated with subject ␣. The values of the nonlinear component weight b2 for each subject is plotted against that
subject’s behaviorally estimated ␣ in Figure 4 B. Across subjects,
those with more inflected decision weights as revealed by the
behavioral stochastic choice function (lower ␣) do have higher
values of b2 estimated from neural activity (r ⫽ ⫺0.35, bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (⫺0.60, ⫺0.05)) The scaling of
the coefficients is arbitrary (since it is derived from BOLD signal)
but the sign of the coefficients is consistent with the theoretical
relationship in Figure 4 A. Subjects with positive b2 coefficients
are generally those with inverse S-shaped weighting functions
(␣ ⬍ 1), who overestimate small probabilities and underestimate

The hypothesis that organisms weight
probabilities objectively (i.e., linearly)
when evaluating risks has been a useful
benchmark in many areas of social and biological sciences and is a reasonable approximation for many risks (Kagel et al., 1995). However, much
of the appeal of the linear-weighting EU model comes from its
empirical superiority to the simpler expected value model [where
u(x) ⫽ x] and the intuitive appeal of its logical axioms.
There is much behavioral evidence, however, that linearity
appears to break down for very high and low probabilities in a
systematic manner (Allais, 1953; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992).
Indeed, Oskar Morgenstern, one of the founders of expected utility theory, speculated that linearity is a plausible assumption
within the intermediate range of probabilities because “a normal
individual would have some intuition of what 50:50 or 25:75
means,” but that linearity at extreme probabilities was unlikely
because “probabilities used must be within certain plausible
ranges and not go to 0.01 or even less to 0.001” (Morgenstern,
1979, p. 178). Allowing for such nonlinearity elegantly reconciles
the common phenomenon of simultaneously purchasing insurance against rare disasters (a risk-averse choice) and buying lottery tickets (a risk-seeking choice) because both are consistent
with overweighting low probabilities.
The linearity hypothesis has also been adopted, often implicitly, in most studies of decision making and learning in neuroscience (Yacubian et al., 2006). For example, in standard models
of reinforcement learning, reward prediction is assumed to result
from an unbiased representation of rewards accumulated from
experience (Montague et al., 2004). Therefore, reward predictions in stochastic environments are expected to be accurate in
the long run. Most existing studies have not sampled closely
enough to probability endpoints to be sensitive to the full pattern
of predicted nonlinearity. For example, in the study by Abler et al.
(2006), the probabilities sampled were {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}, for
money rewards. Berns et al. (2008) used probabilities {1/6, 2/6,
4/6, 5/6, 1} for electric shocks. Given existing evidence that the
inflection point is ⬃1/3, one would expect to find a closely linear
approximation across the range of probabilities in the former
studies, rather than the full reverse S-shaped function. Similarly,
one would expect a convex function in the study by Berns et al.
(2008) with disproportionate brain responses to the lowest probability of 1/6. This is consistent with their results, which found a
U-shaped response in the caudate/subgenual anterior cingulate
cortex. This region of activation is further anterior compared
with our striatal activation, and is negatively correlated with the
magnitude of shock. This potentially reflects differences between
encoding of rewards in the gain and loss domain.
In addition, in many neuroscientific studies of decision making, probabilities are estimated, either from ratios of bars and pie

areas (Huettel et al., 2006; Berns et al., 2008) or from past experience in studies of learning (O’Doherty et al., 2004; Haruno and
Kawato, 2006). This methodology differs from those in the behavioral literature on probability weighting, where the probabilities are usually given explicitly in numerical format (and sometimes graphically as well) (Camerer and Ho, 1994; Wu and
Gonzalez, 1996; Kilka, 2001). Using devices such as pies or bars to
depict probabilities without numerical representations can potentially induce difficulties in interpretation of the source of
probability weighting. There is substantial evidence that individuals make systematic errors in proportion estimation, especially
for proportions close to zero or one (Varey et al., 1990; Hollands
and Dyre, 2000). Therefore it becomes unclear whether the behavioral patterns come from errors in estimating probabilities
from graphical displays, or from nonlinearity in the valuation
process.

In this study, therefore, we closely followed the representation
of decisions under risk used in the behavioral economics literature, while at the same time take into account of the limitations of
neuroimaging measures by separating presentation of the gambles in time. This allowed us to dissociate neural contributions of
the evaluation of individual gambles from activity due to comparison and choice (Fig. 2). The need for temporal separation of
evaluation and choice does not arise in behavioral studies in
which the only observable variable is choice. Existing studies do
not always distinguish between perception of value and the decision process (Paulus and Frank, 2006). This distinction, however,
is of potential importance when using neuroimaging data. The
modeling of probability weighting assumes that the value function
itself is “distorted” (nonlinear) in probabilities, whereas the decision
process is unbiased. The temporal separation therefore allows us to
focus on reward perception, rather than simultaneous perception

<-----Page 6----->Hsu et al. • Neural Correlates of Probability Weighting

and choice (Preuschoff et al., 2006). Our fMRI results suggest that
striatum activity in evaluation of risks is nonlinear in probabilities in
isolation of choice, consistent with standard interpretations of the
weighting function. Activity in the striatum is also found by Tom et
al. (2007) in response to gamble monetary values, and can be used to
link the neural aversion to loss (compared with equal-sized gain) to
behavioral loss-aversion.
More generally, this type of study represents an empirical
competition between models of risky choices which are rooted in
logical axioms (chiefly the independence axiom stated earlier)
and models rooted in psychophysics which can be further
grounded in evolutionary adaptation. This study completes the
exploratory studies to the key elements of prospect theory, the
others being loss aversion (Tom et al., 2007) and framing/reference point (De Martino et al., 2006) (for review, see Fox and
Poldrack, 2008). Our intuition is that brain activity during valuation of risks is more likely to correspond to the cognitive components of prospect theory than to EU, and it will also be easier to
construct an adaptationist account of how evolution would have
shaped brains to follow prospect theory rather than EU (Robson,
2002), since prospect theory follows from psychophysics and EU
from normative logic. Establishing a neural and evolutionary basis of prospect theory could provide an illustrative example of
how the foundation for principles guiding social science might be
usefully shifted from relying largely on logic, to respecting biological implementation (which might, of course, include convergence to logical principles as a result of learning or higher-order
cognition).
There are a number of more general implications for neuroscientific studies of reward and decision making. The maturation
of decision neuroscience and neuroeconomics will likely lead to
increasing emphasis on problems involving extreme tails of the
distribution (e.g., public fear about rare catastrophic risks, pathological gambling, broad participation in long-tailed lotteries, and
preferences for financial assets with positive skewness) (Barberis
and Huang, 2008). The numerical ratio of overweighting of low
probabilities is dramatic for the functions we estimate: probabilities of 10 ⫺2, 10 ⫺6, and 10 ⫺9 are overweighed by factors of 4, 520,
and 33,000, respectively.
In addition, some studies suggest that probabilities learned
through experience do not exhibit the same type of patterns of
behavior as those represented abstractly (Hertwig et al., 2004; Fox
and Hadar, 2006). Furthermore, because the learning process is
still under investigation, it is unknown how the brain updates
probabilities conditional on past events. More studies of the neural basis of response to probabilities represented abstractly, and
those learned from experience, are therefore needed to provide a
unified framework to understand and reconcile these results.
