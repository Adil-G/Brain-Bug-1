changing world is commonly asserted
to be the heart of executive activity in
business. If this is so, a realistic description and theory of the decision-making
process are of central importance to business administration and organization
theory. Moreover, it is extremely doubtful whether the only considerable body
of decision-making theory that has been
available in the past that provided by
economics does in fact provide a realistic account of decision-making in large
organizations operating in a complex
world.
In economics and statistics the rational choice process is described somewhat
as follows:
1. An individual is confronted with a
number of different, specified alternative
courses of action.
2. To each of these alternatives is attached a set of consequences that will
ensue if that alternative is chosen.
3. The individual has a system of preferences or "utilities" that permit him to
rank all sets of consequences according to
preference and to chose that alternative
that has the preferred consequences. In
the case of business decisions the criteri* Graduate School of Industrial Administration,

profit.
If we try to use this fraim-eworkto describe how real human beings go about
making choices in a real world, we soon
recognize that we need to incorporate in
our description of the choice process several elements that are missing from the
economic model:
1. The alternatives are not usually
"given" but must be sought, and hence
it is necessary to include the search for
alternatives as an important part of the
process.
2. The informnationas to what consequences are attached to which alternatives is seldom a "given," but, instead,
the search for consequences is another
important segment of the decision-making task.
3. The comparisons among alternatives are not usually made in terms of
simple, single criterion like profit. One
reason is that there are often important
consequences that are so intangible as to
make an evaluation in terms of profit difficult or impossible. In place of searching
for the "best" alternative, the decisionmaker is usually concerned with finding
a satisfactory alternative one that will
attain a specified goal and at the same
time satisfy a number of auxiliary conditions.
4. Often, in the real world, the problem itself is not a "given," but, instead,
searching for significant problems to
which organizational attention should be
turned becomes an important organizational task.

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS

with respect to the extent to which the
decision-making process is programmed.
At one extreme we have repetitive, welldefined problems (e.g., quality control or
production lot-size problems) involving
tangible considerations, to which the
economic models that call for finding the
best among a set of pre-established alternatives can be applied rather literally. In
contrast to these highly programmed and
usually rather detailed decisions are
problems of a non-repetitive sort, often
involving basic long-range questions
about the whole strategy of the firm or
some part ot it, arising initially in a highly unstructured form and requiring a
great deal of the kinds of search processes listed above. In this whole continuum, from great specificity and repetition to extreme vagueness and uniqueness, we will call decisions that lie toward
the former extreme programmed, and
those lying toward the latter end nonprogramnmed.This simple dichotomy is
just a shorthand for the range of possibilities we have indicated.
It is our aim in the present paper to
illustrate the distinctions we have introduced between the traditional theory of
decision, which appears applicable only
to highly programmed decision problems, and a revised theory, which will
have to take account of the search processes and other information processes
that are so prominent in and characteristic of non-programmed decision-mnaking. We shall do this by recounting the
stages through which an actual problem
proceeded in an actual company and
then commenting upon the significance
of various items in this narrative for future decision-m'aking theory.
The decision was captured and recorded by securing the company's permission
to have a member of the research team
present as an observer in the company's

offices on substantially a full-time basis
during the most active phases of the decision process. The observer spent most
of his time with the executive who had
been assigned the principal responsibility
for handling this particular problem. In
addition, he had full access to the files
for information about events that preceded his period of observation and also
interviewed all the participants who were
involved to a major degree in the decision.
THE ELECTRONIC

DATA-PPROCESSING

DECISION

The decision process to be described
here concerns the feasibility of using electronic data-processing equipment in a
medium size corporation that en-a,e.
both in manufacturing and in sellin
through its own widely scattered outlets.
In July, 1952, the company's controller
assigned to Ronald Middleton, an assistant who was handling several special
studies in the accounting department,
the task of keeping abreast of electronic
developments. The controller, and other
accounting executives, thought that some
of the current developments in electronic
equipment might have application to the
company's accounting processes. He gave
Middleton the task of investigation, because the latter had a good background
for understanding the technical aspects
of computers.
Middleton used three procedures to
obtain information: letters to persons in
established computer firms, discussions
with computer salesmen, and discussions
with persons in other companies that
were experimenting with the use of electronic equipment in accounting. He also
read the current journal literature about
computer developments. He informed
the controller about these matters principally through memorandums that de-

<-----Page 3----->OBSERVATION OF A BUSINESS DECISION

scribed the current status of equipment
and some of the procedures that would be
necessary for an applications study in the
company. Memorandums were written in
November, 1952, October, 1953, and
January, 1954. In them, in addition to
summarizing developments, he recommended that two computer companies be
asked to propose possible installations in
the comipany and that the company begin to adapt its accounting procedures to
future electronic processing.
In the spring of 1954 a computer company representative took the initiative
to propose and make a brief equipment
application study. In August he submitted a report to the company recommending an installation, but this was not acted
upon doubt as to the adequacy of the
computer company's experience and
knowledge in application being a major
factor in the decision. A similar approach
was made by arnothercomputer company
in September, 1954, but terminated at an
early stage without positive action.
These experiences convinced Middleton
and other executives, including the controller, that outside help was needed to
develop and evaluate possible applications of electronic equipment.
Middleton drew up a list of potential
consultants and, by checking outside
sources and using his own information,
selected Alpha as the most suitable.
After preliminary meetings in October
and November, 1954, between representatives of Alpha and the company accounting executives, Alpha was asked to
develop a plan for a study of the application of electronic data-processing to sales
accounting. Additional meetings between
Alpha and coimipanypersonnel were held
in February, 1955, and the proposal for
the study was submitted to the controller
in March.
Although the proposal seemed com-

239

petent and the price reasonable, it was
felt that proposals should be obtained
from another consulting firm as a double
check. The controller agreed to this and
himself selected Beta from Middleton's
list. Subsequently representatives of
Beta met with Middleton and other department executives. Middleton, in a
memorandum to the controller, listed
criteria for choosing between the two
consultants. On the assumption that the
written report from Beta was similar to
the oral proposal made, the comparison
indicated several advantages for Beta
over Alpha.
After the written report was received,
on May 2, the company's rmanagement
committee authorized a consulting agreement with Beta, and work began in July,
1955. The controller established a committee, headed by Middleton, to work on
the project. Middleton was to devote full
time to the assignment; the other two
committee members, one from sales accounting and one from auditing, were to
devote one-third time.
The consulting firm assigned two staff
members, Drs. Able and Baker, to the
study. Their initial meetings with Middleton served the purpose of outlining a
general approach to the problem and
planning the first few steps. Twentythree information-gathering studies were
defined, which Middleton agreed to carry
out, and it was also decided that the consultants would spend some time in field
observation of the actual activities that
the computer might replace.
During July, Middleton devoted most
of his time to the twenty-three studies on
volume of transactions and information
flow, obtaining data from the sales department and from the field staffs of the
other two committee members. Simultaneously, steps were taken to secure the
co-operation of the field personnel who

<-----Page 4----->240

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS

would be visited by the consultants early
in August.
On July 22 Middleton submitted a
progress report to the controller, describing the data-gathering studies, estimating completion dates, and summarizing the program's objectives. On July 25
the consultants met with Middleton and
discussed a method of approach to the
design of the data-processing system.
The field trip took place early in August.
The consultants obtained from field personnel information as to how accounting
tasks were actually handled and as to the
use actually made of information generated by the existing system.
On August 8 Middleton submitted another progress report, giving the status of
the data-gathering studies and recording
some ideas originating in the field trip for
possible changes in the existing information-processing system. On August 10 he
arranged with the assistant controller to
obtain clerical assistance on the datagathering studies, so that the consultants
would not be held up by lack of this information, and on August 17 this work
was completed.
On the following day the consultants
met with the company committee to review the results of the twenty-three
studies. They then listed the outputs,
files, and inputs required by any sales
accounting system the company might
adopt and drew a diagram showing the
flow of the accounting information. The
group also met with the assistant controller and with the controller. The latter
took the opportunity to emphasize his
basic decentralization philosophy.
Upon returning from his vacation early
in September, Middleton discussed the
flow diagram in greater detail with Able
and Baker, and revisions were made on
the basis of information Middleton supplied about the present accounting sys-

tem. Baker pointed out that all the alternative systems available to the company
could be defined by the location of seven
principal functions and records. Further
analysis reduced this number to three:
stock records, pricing of orders, and accounts receivable. The possible combinations of locations of these gave eighteen
basic alternative systems, of which eight
that were obviously undesirable were
eliminated. Middleton was to make a
cost analysis of the existing system and
the most decentralized of the proposed
systems, while the consultants were to
begin costing the most centralized system.
Middleton reviewed these tentative
decisions with the other members of the
company committee, and the group divided up the work of costing. Middleton
also reported to the controller on the conference, and the latter expressed his attitudes about the location of the various
functions and the resulting implications
for the development of executive responsibility.
During the next week, in addition to
working on his current assignments,
Middleton gave an equipment salesman
a preliminary overview of the probable
requirements of a new system. Next,
there was a two-day meeting of the consultants and the company's committee
to discuss the form and implications of a
centralized electronic system. The consultants presented a method of organizing the records for electronic processing
and together with the committee calculated the requirements which this organization and company's volume of transactions would impose on a computer. The
group then discussed several problems
raised by the system, including the auditing problems, and then met with the assistant controller to review the areas they
had discussed.

<-----Page 5----->OBSERVATIONOF A BUSINESS DECISION
On the following day, Middleton summarized progress to date for the controller, emphasizing particularly the work
that had been done on the centralized
system. The controller expressed satisfaction with several new procedures that
would be made possible by an electronic
computer. During the next several days
the committee members continued to
gather the information necessary to determine the cost of the present system.
Middleton also checked with the assistant controller on the proposed solutions
for certain problems that the consultants
had indicated could not be handled readily by a computer and relayed his reactions to the consultants.
A week later the consultants returned
for another series of meetings. They discussed changes that might be necessary
in current practices to make centralized
electronic processing possible and the
way in which they would compare the
centralized and decentralized proposals.
The comparison presented some difficulties, since the data provided by the two
systems would not be identical. A general
form for a preliminary report was cleared
with the assistant controller, and a date
was set for its submission. The processing, outputs, and costs for the two alternatives would be described, so that additional information required for a final
report could be determined.
During the next week Middleton continued collecting cost data. He phoned to
the consultants to provide them with important new figures and to inform them
of the controller's favorable reaction to
certain proposed changes in the system
that had implications for the company's
policies.
On October 17 Baker met with Middleton to review the content of the accounting reports that would be produced
by the centralized system, to discuss

241

plans for the preliminary report, and to
discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the centralized and decentralized systems. On the next day, Middleton checked on their decisions relative
to the report with the controller and assistant controller and raised the possibility of an outside expert being retained
by the company to review the final report
submitted by Beta. During the last days
of this week, Middleton attended the
national meeting of a management society, where he obtained information about
the availability of computers and computer personnel and the existence of
other installations comparable to that
contemplated for the company.
Work continued on the planning and
costing of the two systems-Middleton
worked primarily on the decentralized
plan, and the consultants on the centralized. On October 27 the two consultants
met with Middleton and they informed
each other of the status of their work.
Baker discussed methods for evaluating
system reliability. Plans for the preliminary report were discussed with the company committee and the assistant controller. Since the controller strongly
favored decentralization of authority,
the question was raised of the compatibility of this with electronic processing in
general and with the centralized system
in particular. The groups concluded,
however, that centralization of purely
clerical data-processing operations was
compatible with decentralization of responsibility and authority.
After several meetings between the
committee and the consultants to iron
out details, the preliminary report was
presented to the company committee,
the controller, and the assistant controller on November 3. The report was
devoted primarily to the centralized
system. The following points were made

<-----Page 6----->242

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS

in the oral presentation: (1) that both
the centralized and decentralized proposals would yield substantial and roughly equivalent savings but that the centralized system would provide more and
better accounting data; (2) that the alternatives had been costed conservatively; (3) that the centralized system involved centralization of paper work, not
of management; (4) that not all problems
raised by the centralized system had been
worked out in detail but that these did
not appear insurmountable; (5) that the
centralized system would facilitate improved inventory control; and (6) that its
installation would require nine to twelve
months at a specified cost. At this meeting the group decided that in the final
report only the two systems already considered would be costed, that the final
report would be submitted on December
1, and that investigation of other accounting applications of the system
would be postponed.
In informal conversations after the
meeting the controller told Middleton he
had the impression that the consultants
strongly favored the centralized system
and that he believed the cost considerations were relatively minor compared
with the impact the system would have
on executives' operating philosophies.
The assistant controller told Middleton
he thought the preliminary report did
not adequately support the conclusions.
The committee then reviewed with the
assistant controller the reasons for analyzing in detail only the two extreme
systems: the others either produced less
information or were more costly.
The next day the committee met with
the controller and assistant controller to
determine what additional information
should be requested for the final report.
The controller outlined certain questions
of practicability that the final report
should answer and expressed the view

that the report should contain a section
summarizing the specific changes that
the system would bring about at various
levels of the organization. He thought the
comparison between systems in the preliminary report had emphasized equivalence of savings, without detailing other
less tangible benefits of the centralized
system.
Middleton reported these discussions
to the consultants and with them developed flow charts and organization charts
for inclusion in the final report, settled on
some intermediate deadlines, and worked
up an outline of the report. Within the
company he discussed with the controller
and assistant controller the personnel
and organizational requirements for installation of an electronic system and for
operation after installation. Discussion
focused on the general character and organizational location of the eventual electronic-data-processing group, its relation
to the sales accounting division, and
long-term relations with manufacturing
accounting and with a possible operations research group.
On November 14 the controller, on
recommendation of Middleton, attended
a conference on automation for company
senior executives. There he expressed the
view that three to five years would be
required for full installation of a centralized electronic system but that the fear
of obsolescence of equipment should not
deter the company in making the investment. He also concluded that a computer
installation would not reverse his longrange program for decentralizing information and responsibility.
Middleton, his suggestion being accepted, made tentative arrangements
with an independent expert and with two
large computer companies for the review
of the consultants' report. Middleton
presented to the controller and assistant
controller a memorandum he had pre-

<-----Page 7----->OBSERVATION OF A BUSINESS DECISION

pared at the latter's request, establishing
a new comparison of the centralized and
a modified decentralized system. The
modification made the two systems more
nearly comparable in data-processing
capacity, hence clarified the cost comparison, which was now in favor of the
centralized system. Consideration of the
possibility of starting with a partially
electronic decentralized system as a step
toward a completely electronic system
led to the decision that this procedure
had no special advantages. The controller reported that conversations with the
sales manager and the president had
secured agreement with the concept of
removal of stock record-keeping from
field locations-an aspect of the plan to
which it had been assumed there would
be sales department opposition. The
group discussed several other specific
topics and reaffirmed that the final report should discuss more fully the relative advantages and disadvantages of
centralized and decentralized systems.
Toward the end of November there
was further consultation on the report,
and final arrangements for its review
were made with the two equipment companies and the independent expert. Each
equipment company was expected to determine the method for setting up the
proposed system on its computer and to
check the consultants' estimates of computer capacity. During this week the
controller informed the company's management committee that the report from
the consultants would be submitted
shortly and would recommend a rather
radical change to electronic data-processing.
The final report, which recommended
installation of the centralized system,
was submitted on December 1. The report consisted of a summary of recommendations, general description of the
centralized system, a discussion of the

243

installation program, and six appendixes:
(1) statistics on volume of transactions
(the twenty-three studies); (2) costs of
the present system; (3) the requirements
of a fully centralized system; (4) changes
in allocation of functions required by the
system; (5) an outline of the alternative
decentralized system; and (6) a description of the existing system in verbal and
flow-chart form. When the report was
received and reviewed initially, the company's committee members and the consultants made some further computations on installation costs.
At a meeting the following Monday
the assistant controller proposed an action program: send copies of the report
to equipment companies, send copies to
the sales department, and await the report of the independent expert. The controller decided that the second and third
steps should be taken before giving the
report to the machine companies, and the
assistant controller indicated to Middleton some points requiring further clarification and elaboration.
By January 7 Middleton had prepared
an outline for a presentation of the report to the sales department. This was
revised on the basis of a meeting with
the other interested accounting executives. A final outline was agreed upon
after two more revisions and three more
meetings. The report was presented on
January 28 to the president and to six of
the top executives of the sales department. The presentation discussed largescale computers briefly, described with
flow charts the proposed system, emphasized the completeness and accuracy of
the information produced, discussed
costs and savings, and mentioned the
current trend in other companies toward
electronic data-processing.
At Middleton's recommendation the
same presentation was made subsequently to top members of the accounting de-

<-----Page 8----->244

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS

partment and still later to a group from
the manufacturing department. At the
same time the preliminary report of the
independent expert was received, agreeing that the electronic installation
seemed justifiable and stating that there
might not be any cost savings but that
it would make possible numerous other
profitable applications of the computer.
The consultants' report was then distributed to the computer companies, and
Middleton began more detailed planning
of the installation.
Middleton, the assistant controller,
and the controller now met with the independent expert, who reported his conclusions: the feasibility study was excellent, the estimates of processing time
were probably optimistic, the installation
program should provide for an early test
run, and the two principal available computers were highly competitive. Independent confirmation had been obtained
on the last two points from another outside source. Middleton now proposed
that the company proceed with its planning while awaiting the final written report from the independent expert and the
proposals of the equipment companies.
The assistant controller preferred to wait
until these reports were actually in hand.
During the next week the equipment
companies proceeded with their analysis,
meeting several times with Middleton.
Baker sent a memorandum on his estimates of processing time to meet the
criticism of the independent expert.
Middleton prepared two charts, one proposing a schedule and the staffing requirements for the installation phase, the
other proposing organizational arrangements for the computer center. Middleton and the assistant controller presented
these to the controller at the beginning
of February, discussion centering responsibility for accuracy of input information.

Middleton and the assistant controller
also had a meeting with sales executives
who reported that on the basis of their
own internal departmental discussions of
the consultants' report they were in general agreement with the program. Middleton and one of the other committee
members then spent two days inspecting
computer installations in two other
companies.
In the middle of February the two
equipment companies presented their
reports, each bringing a team of three or
four men to present their recommendations orally. The two recommendations
were substantially alike (except for the
brand of the machine recommended!),
but one report emphasized the availability of its personnel to give help during the
installation planning stage.
Discussions were held in the accounting department and with consultant
Baker about these reports and the next
steps to be taken. The question was debated whether a commitment should be
made to one equipment company or
whether a small group should continue
planning the system in detail, postponing
the equipment decision until fall. Most
of the group preferred the former alternative.
On February 15 the controller, in conference with the assistant controller and
Middleton, dictated a letter to the company's president summarizing the conclusions and recommendations of the
study and requesting that the accounting
department be authorized to proceed
with the electronics program.
On the following day the controller
read the letter to the management committee. The letter reviewed briefly the
history of the project and summarized
the conclusions contained in the consultants' report: that there was ample
justification for an electronic-data-processing installation; that the installation

<-----Page 9----->OBSERVATION OF A BUSINESS DECISION

would warrant use of the largest computers; and that it would produce savings, many intangible benefits, and
excess computer capacity for other applications. The letter quoted the consultants' estimate of the cost of the installation and their recommendation that the
company proceed at once to make such a
conversion and to acquire the necessary
equipment. It then cited the various
cross-checks that had been made of the
consultants' report and concluded with
a repetition of the conclusions of the report-but
estimating more conservatively the operating and installation
costs-and a request for favorable management committee action. Supplementary information presented included a
comparison of consultant and equipment
company cost estimates and a list of
present and proposed computer installations in other companies. After a few
questions and brief discussion, the management committee voted favorably on
the recommendation, and the controller
informed Middleton of the decision when
the meeting ended.
THE ANATOMY OF THE DECISION

From this narrative, or more specifically from the actual data on which the
narrative is based, one can list chronologically the various activities of which
the decision process is composed. If we
wish to describe a program for making a
decision of this kind, each of these activities might be taken as one of the steps of
the program. If the rules that determined when action would switch from
one program step to another were specified, and if the program steps were described in enough detail, it would be possible to replicate the decision process.
The program steps taken together define in retrospect, then, a program for an
originally unprogrammed decision. The
program would be an inefficient one be-

245

cause it would contain all the false
starts and blind alleys of the original
process, and some of these could presumably be avoided if the process were
repeated. However, describing the process that took place in terms of such a program is a useful way of organizing the
data for purposes of analysis.
In order to make very specific what is
meant here by a "program," Chart I has
been prepared to show the broad outlines
of the actual program for the first stages
of the decision process (through the first
seven paragraphs of the narrative).
CHART I

Transfer control to chosen consultant;
Choice: accept or reject proposal;

And so on.

Subprograms.-The various program
steps of the decision process fall into several subprograms, some of which have
been indicated in Chart I. These subprograms are ways of organizing the activities postfactum, and in Chart I the organizing principle is the method of approach

<-----Page 10----->246

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS

taken by the company to the total problem. It remains a question as to whether
this organizing principle will be useful in
all cases. As in the present example, these
subprograms may sometimes be false
starts, but these must be regarded as
parts of the total program, for they may
contribute information for later use, and
their outcomes determine the switching
of activity to new subprograms.
In this particular case the reasons for
switching from one subprogram to another were either the proved inadequacy
of the first one or a redefinition of the
problem. Other reasons for switching can
be imagined, and a complete theory of
the decision process will have to specify
the conditions under which the switch
from one line of attack to another will
occur.
Commonprocesses.-In the whole decision-making program there are certain
steps or "routines" that recur within
several of the subprograms; they represent the basic activities of which the
whole decision process is composed. For
purposes of discussion we have classified
these common processes in two categories: the first comprises processes relating to the communication requirements of the organization; the second
comprises processes relating directly to
the solution of the decisional problem.
Communication processes.-Organizational decision-making requires a variety
of communication activities that are absent when a decision is made in a single
human head. If we had written out the
program steps in greater detail, many
more instances of contacts among different members of the organization would
be recorded than are now explicit in the
narrative. The contacts may be oral or
written. Oral contacts are used for such
purposes as giving orders, transmitting
information, obtaining approval or criti-

cism of proposed action; written communications generally take the form of
memorandums having the purpose of
transmitting information or proposing
action.
The information-transmitting function is crucial to organizational decisionmaking, for it almost always involves
acts of selection or "filtering" by the information source. In the present instance,
which is rather typical in this respect, the
consultants and subordinate executives
are principal information sources; and
the controller and other top executives
must depend upon them for most of their
technical information. Hence, the subordinate acts as an information filter and
in this way secures a large influence over
the decisions the superior can and does
reach.
The influence of the information
source over communications is partly
controlled by checking processes-for example, retaining an independent expert
give the
to check consultants-which
recipient an independent information
source. This reduces, but by no means
eliminates, filtering. The great differences in the amounts and kinds of information available to the various participants in the decision process described
here emphasize the significance of filtering. It will be important to determine
the relationship of the characteristics of
the information to the resultant infoimation change and to explore the effects of
personal relations between people on the
filtering process and hence upon the
transmission of information.
Problem-solving processes.-Alongside
the organizational communication processes, we find in the narrative a number
of important processes directed toward
the decision problem itself. One of the
most prominent of these is the search for
alternative courses of action. The first

<-----Page 11----->OBSERVATION OF A BUSINESS DECISION

activities recounted in the narrativewriting letters, reading journals, and so
on-were attempts to discover possible
action alternatives. At subsequent points
in the process searches were conducted to
obtain lists of qualified consultants and
experts. In addition to these, there were
numerous searches-most of them only
implicit in the condensed narrative-to
find action alternatives that would overcome specific difficulties that emerged as
detail was added to the broader alternatives.
The data support strongly the assertion made in the introduction that
searches for alternative courses of action
constitute a significant part of non-programmed decision-making-a part that
is neglected by the classical theory of
rational choice. In the present case the
only alternatives that became available
to the company without the expenditure
of time and effort were the systems proposals made early in the process by representatives of two equipment companies,
and these were both rejected. An important reason for the prominent role of
search in the decision process is that the
"problem" to be solved was in fact a
whole series of "nested" problems, each
alternative solution to a problem at one
level leading to a new set of problems at
the next level. In addition, the process of
solving the substantive problems created
many procedural problems for the organization: allocating time and work, planning agendas and report presentations,
and so on.
Examination of the narrative shows
that there is a rich variety of search
processes. Many questions remain to be
answered as to what determines the particular character of the search at a particular stage in the decision process: the
possible differences between searches for
procedural alternatives, on the one hand,
and for substantive alternatives, on the

247

other; the factors that determine how
many alternatives will be sought before
a choice is made; the conditions under
which an alternative that has tentatively
been chosen will be subjected to further
check; the general types of search
strategies.
The neglect of the search for alternatives in the classical theory of decision
would be inconsequential if the search
were so extensive that most of the alternatives available "in principle" were
generally discovered and considered. In
that case the search process would have
no influence upon the alternative finally
selected for action. The narrative suggests that this is very far from the truth
-that, in fact, the search for alternatives
terminates when a satisfactory solution
has been discovered even though the
field of possibilities has not been exhausted. Hence, we have reason to suppose
that changes in the search process or its
outcome will actually have major effects
on the final decision.
A second class of common processes
encompasses information-gathering and
similar activity aimed at determining the
consequences of each of several alternatives. In many decisions, certainly in the
one we observed, these activities account
for the largest share of man-hours, and
it is through them that subproblems are
discovered. The narrative suggests that
there is an inverse relation between the
cost or diff-culty of this investigational
task and the number of alternative
courses of action that are examined carefully. Further work will be needed to determine if this relation holds up in a
broader range of situations. The record
also raises numerous questions about the
kinds of consequences that are examined
most closely or at all and about the conditions under which selection of criteria
for choice is prior to, or subsequent to,
the examination of consequences.

THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS

Another set of common processes are
those concerned with the choices among
alternatives. Such processes appear at
many points in the narrative: the selection of a particular consulting firm from
a list, the choice between centralized and
decentralized electronic-data-processing
systems, as well as numerous more detailed choices. These are the processes
most closely allied to the classical theorv
of choice, but even here it is notable that
traditional kinds of "maximizing" procedures appear only rarely.
In some situations the choice is between competing alternatives, but in
many others it is one of acceptance or
rejection of a single course of actionreally a choice between doing something
at this time and doing nothing. The first
such occasion was the decision by the
controller to assign Middleton to the task
of watching developments in electronics,
a decision that initiated the whole sequence of later choices. In decisions of
this type the consequences of the single
alternative are judged against some kind
of explicit or implicit "level of aspiration"-perhaps expressed in terms of an
amount of improvement over the existing
situation-while in the multiple-alternative situations, the consequences of the
several alternatives are compared with
each other. This observation raises a host
of new questions relating to the circumstances under which the decision will be
formulated in terms of the one or the
other of these frameworks and the personal and organizational factors that determine the aspiration levels that will be
applied in the one-alternative case.
Another observation derivable from
our data-though it is not obvious from
the condensed narrative given here-is
that comparability and non-comparability of the criteria of choice affects the decision processes in significant ways. For
one thing, the criteria are not the same

from one choice to another: one choice
may be made on the basis of relative
costs and savings, while the next may be
based entirely on non-monetary criteria.
Further, few, if any, of the choices were
based on a single criterion. Middleton
and the others recognized and struggled
with this problem of comparing consequences that were sometimes measured
in different, and incomparable, units, and
even more often involved completely intangible considerations. The narrative
raises, but does not answer, the question
of how choices are made in the face of
these incommensurabilities and the degree to which tangible considerations are
overemphasized or underemphasized as
compared with intangibles as a result.
CONCLUSION

We do not wish to try to transform one
swallow into a summer by generalizing
too far from a single example of a decision process. We have tried to illustrate,
however, using a large relatively nonprogrammed decision in a business firm,
some of the processes that are involved
in business decision-making and to indicate the sort of theory of the choice
mechanism that is needed to accommodate these processes. Our illustration suggests that search processes and information-gathering processes constitute significant parts of decision-making and
must be incorporated in a theory of decision if it is to be adequate. While the
framework employed here-and particularly the analysis of a decision in terms
of a hierarchical structure of programsis far from a complete or finished theory,
it appears to provide a useful technique
of analysis for researchers interested in
the theory of decision as well as for business executives who may wish to review
the decision-making procedures of their
own companies.
