Building upon new findings from the field of behavioral finance and economics, this
article provides fresh insights into how venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs
perceive, experience, and deal with risk; and how they go about making decisions in
their respective areas of venture creation, venture evaluation, venture growth, and
investing.
By helping VCs and entrepreneurs to be cognizant of the many psychological traps that
continuously get turned on at and around decision-making times, such findings would
certainly help both parties to avoid committing costly mistakes in their businesses.

It is well recognized by psychologists that
to make a decision, emotion is the necessary trigger. Without emotion, one would
be reduced to the state of an idiot savant
who goes on endlessly calculating without
the ability to make a choice. (Olsen, 2008)

Venture capitalists, entrepreneurs,
and the psychology of
decision-making
Financing a venture is among the most contentious, and yet most critical, functions for both
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists (VCs).
The reason for this is that almost all venture
capital contracts are negotiated and entered
into under conditions of extreme moral hazard
and adverse selection. Moral hazard is a situation where the entrepreneur, acting as the
‘agent’ for a venture, takes self-interested and

unobservable actions at the expense of the VC
who acts as the ‘principal’. Adverse selection
enters into the equation because by definition
the entrepreneur (‘agent’) possesses superior
knowledge about the venture that is useful to
her/him but the VC is not aware of such
knowledge or possibly its existence.

The resultant agency costs and information

otherwise promising enterprises. Agency
theory — which has its roots in Berle and
Means (1932) and was further developed by
Jensen and Meckling (1976) — has been proposed as a model to mitigate such problems.
However, recent research findings show that
‘evidence supporting the theory’s predictions
is mixed and weak’ (Bitler et al., 2009). Such
conclusions are not surprising at all to behavioral economists because, in all agency theorybased venture capital and financial contracting
analyses:
(i) the entrepreneur is seen as the agent
(hired labor) and the VC as the principal
(hirer and firer of the entrepreneur/agent);
and
(ii) the presumed conflict of interest issues
and other agency problems are solved
using the traditional and ‘God-ish’ expected
utility (EU) algorithm.
The reality is different on two counts:

In fact, the human brain
is not capable of doing
what theory expects
it to do
1. Laboratory research from the field of cognitive psychology and decisions science,
especially over the past 30 years or so
(e.g., Tversky and Kahneman, 1973, 1974),
has clearly shown that when it comes to
judgment and decision-making under uncertainty, individuals do not do the complicated and humanly impossible calculations
prescribed by the normative EU model.
In fact, the human brain is not capable of
doing what theory expects it to do. Instead,
individuals use a set of heuristics, or ‘rules
of thumb’, to make judgments and come up
with the needed decisions. Such findings
have also given rise to a whole new area of
behavioral finance and economics, which
is the main platform for our discussion and
advice on venture financing issues in this
article.

2. A reality of our times is that entrepreneurs
take on all types of business functions
throughout the whole entrepreneurial process — from opportunity recognition and
self- or co-financing stages to follow-up
phases of growth and exit. This means the
entrepreneur can also be the principal
(investor) and the investor/VC can also be
the agent (the entrepreneur).1 In other
words, venture capital contracts and deals
are practically partnership agreements and
not principal/agent (or effectively employer/
employee) contracts as stipulated by agency
theory. Those who are even slightly familiar with the venture capital industry can
easily attest to this reality.2
Further, understanding risk and risk-taking
behavior — the essence of any entrepreneurial endeavor — is now studied within a framework that considers the human brain as a
dual-process system. Such an approach to
understanding risk is based on the latest findings in the areas of neuroscience and decision
theory.3

This is especially true given the fact that the complexity
(read risk of success or failure) of entrepreneurs and
their new products and services has increased tremendously. Examples can especially be found in more complicated fields of IT, biotech, nanotech, and similar
industries.
2
For example, when a venture reaches its ‘fundability’
stage (meaning annual revenue potential of $75–100 m
in three to four years), the founding entrepreneur is
already a major investor in that venture regardless of
other existing ownership interests in such a venture. The
entrepreneur is a major investor not only functionally
but even more importantly in a perceived manner. In
fact, her/his stake in the said venture is most probably
his one and only asset that he possesses at such a financing time. By the same token, when a VC helps a funded
venture in attracting next-round investors as well as
other value-added services like new managerial talent,
advisors, and other forms of service, that VC in fact is
acting as an agent for such a venture. Besides, considering an entrepreneur as an agent, effectively an employee,
who can be fired through different conditions built in a
typical venture capital agreement, goes against the whole
notion of entrepreneurialism, creativity, and innovation;
and may in fact explain why some ventures fail.

Given the limited scope of this article, discussion on
this issue as related to entrepreneurs and VCs is postponed for another writing. However, for the latest

And this takes us to our main discussion in
the present article. More specifically, our goal
is to discuss how laboratory findings from the
fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can help venture capitalists and entrepreneurs make more effective decisions and
avoid costly mistakes in their respective lines
of businesses. The following section briefly
discusses some key heuristics and biases and
how they affect our judgment and decision
process. We then summarize the article and
provide practical advice to both VCs and
entrepreneurs.

Heuristics and biases and how they
affect our judgment and decisions in
entrepreneurial settings

According to Kawasaki, VC funding is more
like the ‘brainless’ ‘Hot or Not’ service, where
initial decisions to choose potential life partners are made in around 15 seconds; and not
like the highly analytical ‘e-Harmony’, where
detailed profiles and sophisticated analyses
play key roles in choosing a partner. Although

industry, it also serves as an example for
making our point regarding how individuals
make their daily decisions at work and
elsewhere.
Skipping many volumes of supporting laboratory findings and academic research on the
issue, it can safely be stated that individuals
mainly rely on a limited number of mental
strategies or heuristics, which ‘reduce the
complex tasks of assessing probabilities and
predicting values to simpler judgmental
operations’ (Tversky and Kahneman, 1985).
These heuristics are the same strategies that
have served human beings for thousands of
years against all sorts of nature’s hazards and
date back to the cave ages.

We as humans have our
own biases because in
actuality we operate on
heuristics and mental
short cuts

Such heuristics or rules of thumb work in
some instances but not in all. Just by their
nature, such experience-based heuristics may
lead to persistent biases that might harm one’s
judgment and decision. We as humans have
our own biases because in actuality we operate
on heuristics and mental short cuts. This is
true for lay men and women as well as welltrained professionals and industry experts.
Even more dangerous is the finding that our
brain may not even accept evidence and
otherwise credible data and information if we
already have developed an ‘affect or feeling’
toward an object like a business venture or a
new technology. Research has shown that
strong initial views may not be changed easily
or changed at all because such initial views
influence the way our brain processes subsequent information and arrives at a sought-after
decision (Slovic, 1987). This now seems more
like the ‘brainless’ ‘Hot or Not’ dating service
and not the more sophisticated ‘e-Harmony’.

New evidence appears reliable and informative if it is consistent with one’s initial
belief; contrary evidence tends to be dismissed as unreliable, erroneous, or unrepresentative. (Nisbet and Ross, as reported
in Slovic, 1987)
The above findings have major implications
for risk and risk-taking by all individuals,
including and especially VCs and entrepreneurs. And this now takes us to a brief discussion on the main heuristic principles
and the way such heuristics influence our
judgment and choice in an entrepreneurial
setting.

The affect heuristic
Simply stated, the very powerful affect heuristic has been defined as a feeling state, such as
niceness and awfulness or, better yet, goodness or badness when, for example, one faces
an investment opportunity or a start-up potential. Affect can also be viewed as a quality,
such as acceptable and unacceptable, associated with a hazard like a business venture.
Additionally, affect can be described as behavior that places heavy reliance on intuition,
instinct, and gut feeling.4

The affect heuristic is probably among the
top mental shortcuts because it has been able
to explain the otherwise peculiar negative
relationship between risk and required or

expected return or gain in investment situations.5 For example, a ‘good feeling’ toward a
high-risk proposition like a start-up would
lead to a higher perceived benefit in that startup and a lower risk perception in that venture.
And this is perfectly rational, too!
New research has shown that ‘affective
reactions to stimuli (like venture proposals)
are often the very first reactions, occurring
automatically and subsequently guiding
information processing and judgment’
(Finucane et al., 2000). Based on such findings, it follows that entrepreneurs start businesses they like (and not necessarily the ones
they consider as having high potential) and
VCs finance ventures they find attractive (and
not necessarily the ones they consider as
highly profitable).
If the above hold true, then in the real
world of start-ups and venture financing,
even if VCs are more rational (and less
affective), which probably they are, entrepreneurs may not see risk/return tradeoffs
the way VCs see them. Consequently, and as
far as risk/return perceptions and motivations by entrepreneurs and VCs are concerned, we will be dealing with possibly two
different market forces that do not see eye to
eye.6 This then calls for new ways to design,
negotiate, close, and monitor venture capital
contracts.
Overconfidence and illusion of control
The significance of an overconfidence heuristic lies in the fact that it can shape the way we
as individuals perceive and understand risk;
and consequently, take risk. Overconfidence
in an entrepreneur or a VC would lower the
risk seen by her or him in a given venture. The

Normally, in investment situations investors in high-risk
assets require high returns. However, from what we
have learned from psychology, if an individual develops
a ‘good feeling’ (positive affect) for a high-risk investment, she/he may require low return from such an
investment.
6
This can also explain why agency theory may not be as
helpful in mitigating the moral hazard and adverse selection problems that arise in venture capital contracting.

The significance of an
overconfidence heuristic
lies in the fact that it can
shape the way we as
individuals perceive and
understand risk
feeling of control seems to be even stronger
in entrepreneurs.7
In numerous psychological studies researchers have found that most people are overconfident about both their abilities and their
knowledge. For example, in a study of entrepreneurs, it was found that over 80% of the
entrepreneurs perceived their chances of
success as 70% or better. Moreover, 33% of
them characterized their success as certain!
The mean chance of success that entrepreneurs placed on a business like theirs was 59%
(as compared with a historically stable survival
rate of 33% during the first five years of a
venture; Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993).
Such unreasonably high numbers in the real
world explain why so many ventures fail in
their first few years of operation.
Availability or recency
To understand this judgment heuristic, we just
need to know that people disproportionately
recall the salient events that they have
observed; those that are very recent, and/or
those that individuals are/were emotionally
involved with, especially in the very recent
past. The more salient an event is, the more
likely the probability that we can recall that
event. With the availability heuristics, people
search their memories for relevant but recent
information and data.

7

Aside from research findings by Forlani, Olsen, and
others, my own personal experience as a founding entrepreneur involved in launching a rather significant publishing venture can attest to the power that illusion of
control or overconfidence has over our risk-taking
behavior.

The result is that this sort of bias prevents
us from considering other potential and related
outcomes that may not have occurred just as
recently. For example, a San Francisco Bay
Area entrepreneur may assess the risk of starting a new venture by recalling all the positive
reports on all successful start-ups that she/he
has recently been reading about in the business section of the Silicon Valley Mercury
News. The problem, however, is that not all
memories are equally retrievable (read available), and this leads to error in judgment. In
the above example, more recent incidences
and more salient events (all positive reports on
successful start-ups) will weigh more heavily
than possibly non-occurred and non-reported
incidences and this will lead to prediction
biases and would distort one’s judgment or
estimate.

The more salient an event
is, the more likely the
probability that we can
recall that event

Biases implicit in the availability heuristic
affect estimates of risk.

Anchoring and adjustment
Anchoring refers to a tendency to anchor on,
and stay around, an initial arbitrary value
which may be suggested by the way a proposition is presented or by some initial computation. When forming estimates and predictions,
perceptions can be influenced by suggestions.
People adjust away from an initial value suggested to them (the anchor) insufficiently to
arrive at the true value of the subject under
consideration (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974).
An example would be the way an investment
banker uses the relative valuation model (multiples method) to arrive at an IPO price, or a
VC uses the same method to price a venture

capital deal. In both cases prevailing multiples
which are chosen and adjusted up or down on
an arbitrary basis are used to come up with a
price. And that is where the bias comes in.
Maybe a more sensible alternative would be to
look at the risks involved and the types of cash
flows expected from the business and then
come up with a value.

From the VC’s point of
view, anchoring bias can
be used to statistically
argue that an
entrepreneur may
overestimate the chances
of success of his/
her business

From the VC’s point of view, anchoring bias
can be used to statistically argue that an entrepreneur may overestimate the chances of
success of his/her business. Following Tversky,
Kahneman, and Minniti, such arguments can
go like this. Starting a business venture is a
conjunctive event; for a start-up to succeed, it
must succeed in all the steps needed for its
success as a whole. It must first succeed in
producing a working prototype, then employing the needed resources, including financing,
to actually manufacture the product, and later
hire a marketing and sales force to bring in
revenue. However, from a statistical point of
view, the overall probability of a conjunctive
event like a start-up is lower than the probability of each elementary event if such events are
independent. This means even if each of the
steps is very likely, the overall probability of
the venture’s success as a whole is low. And
this leads to overoptimism by entrepreneurs
as they take the lower probabilities of elementary events as a reference point and adjust
them up or down insufficiently to arrive at a
desired overall probability for the venture as a
whole.

Summary and conclusions
As a summary, let us recall that according to the
latest findings from the fields of psychology and
neuroscience as reported in this article, our
brain operates as a dual-processing system
where one process is rooted in cognition (analytical, rule-based, or what is known as rational
operation) and the other is embedded in affect
(experience-based, emotional, or what is known
as affective operation). We discussed four major
psychological phenomena that influence the
way we make choice and judgment: affect heuristic, overconfidence, availability, and anchoring phenomena. We also confirmed that ‘most
investors’ risk perceptions simultaneously
contain affective and cognitive elements’.
The experience-based affective operation of
the brain has its own unique advantages as at
minimum, it simplifies, reduces costs for, and
speeds up the decision-making process for
individuals across the board. However, the
same operation can also lead to biases which
in turn can lead us in the wrong direction at
the time of a decision. And all this can happen
‘in the background’, in a seamless manner, so
we may not even notice anything. The reason
for this is that ‘affective reactions are often the
very first reactions, occurring automatically
and subsequently guiding information processing and judgment’. Even if we notice our
biased way of thinking and we want to ‘de-bias’
such a process, our brain may not allow it
because of the way our brain is hard wired!

In the end, it is our
brain’s human-like
(affective) subsystem that
calls all the shots!
What this really means is that we as VCs
and/or entrepreneurs may do all the sophisticated analyses, formal due diligences, and
complicated evaluations and valuations on a
given venture using our brain’s computer-like
(rational) subsystem; however, in the end, it
is our brain’s human-like (affective) subsystem
that calls all the shots!

To improve our decision-making process,
we need to:
(i) be aware of the inner working of our brain
and get to know how in reality we as individuals arrive at a given judgment and
choice; and
(ii) become aware of the main psychological
traps and biases that continuously get
turned on at and around our decisionmaking times. We may not be fully capable
of de-biasing our choice process, but still
this is much better than the alternative.
Although we have discussed the most relevant
cognitive traps and biases that entrepreneurs
and VCs may encounter in this article,
there are still other phenomena like framing
effect, confirmation bias, representativeness,
and mental accounting that we have not
discussed.
