Abstract
Classical theories of choice emphasise decision making as a rational process. In general,
these theories fail to recognise the formulation stages of a decision and typically can only
be applied to problems comprising two or more measurable alternatives. In response to
such limitations, numerous descriptive theories have been developed over the last forty
years, intended to describe how decisions are made. This paper presents a framework
that classifies descriptive theories using a theme of comparison; comparisons involving
attributes, alternatives and situations. The paper also reports on research undertaken
within a New Zealand local authority. Twenty three senior managers were interviewed
about their decision making with the aim of comparing the responses of participants with
how the descriptive decision making literature purports decisions are made. Evidence of
behaviour consistent with recognised descriptive theories was also investigated. It was
found that few managers exhibited behaviour consistent with what is described in the
literature. The major difference appears to be the lack of decision formulation contained
within most descriptive theories. Descriptive theories are, in general, theories of choice
and few decisions described by participants contained a distinct choice phase.

1 Introduction
“Classical theories of choice in organisations emphasise decision making as the making of
rational choices on the basis of expectations about the consequences of action for prior
objectives, and organisational forms as instruments for making those choices” [14]. It is
likely that most organisations would like to think they and their employees follow such
rational processes; in practice it is unlikely to be frequently achieved.
The gap between descriptive (what we are observed to do) and normative (what we
should do) decision making is extensive and in fact has widened over recent years [12].
There are potentially two paths by which the gap may be narrowed. Firstly, and the view
Payne et al. [15] appear to take, is to attempt to persuade decision makers to adopt more
normative techniques. Although this could certainly improve decision making,
convincing decision makers to do so is likely to be a significant hurdle. Conversely,
normative theories may be “humanised” by incorporating aspects of human limitations
and behaviour.
This paper briefly reviews the descriptive decision making literature and presents a
framework that classifies descriptive models. It also reports on the results of an
empirical investigation into managerial decision processes.

<-----Page 1----->2 A Review of the Field
The way people can and do make decisions varies considerably. Much early research has
focused on the way we are observed to make decisions and the way in which we should
theoretically make decisions, and as a result, the range and diverseness of theory is vast.
From this theory, an array of decision making models have emerged. Depending on their
methodological foundation, these models can be classified as either descriptive,
prescriptive or normative.
2.1 Descriptive, Prescriptive, and Normative Modes of Decision Making
As research has evolved, the distinction between descriptive and normative theories has
become fuzzy. Normative theories have been refined so that they better “describe”
decision making, e.g., Prospect Theory [9], Subjective Expected Utility [26] etc.
Similarly, theories descriptive in nature have sought to introduce normative axioms, e.g.,
the Advantage Model [18]. It is, however, important that the distinction between
descriptive and normative remains clear; the distinction acts as a useful reference point
when attempting to improve managerial decision making processes. More recently, a
third classifier has been introduced which better describes models such as the Advantage
Model and Prospect Theory. A prescriptive model is one which can and should be used
by a real decision maker and is tuned to both the specific situation, and needs of the
decision maker. Prescriptive models are based on both the strong theoretical foundation
of normative theory in combination with the observations of descriptive theory. A simple
way of distinguishing between these modes of decision making is:
Descriptive: What people actually do, or have done.
Prescriptive: What people should and can do.
Normative: What people should do (in theory).
The focus of this paper is descriptive decision making and the processes employed by
real decision makers. Simon [21] proposed a three phase trichotomy of decision
processes. These three phases he termed Intelligence, Design and Choice (see Figure 1).

Intelligence

Design

Choice

1. Simon’s Model of the Decision Process
Intelligence (which was borrowed from and based upon the military meaning of the
same word) involves identifying the need for a decision or as Simon put it, “searching the
environment.” Once the environment has been searched, i.e., the need for a decision
identified, the design phase commences. This comprises investigating and developing the
problem domain and alternatives. Simon’s final phase is that of choice, which describes
the activity of selecting the most appropriate course of action from the alternatives
previously generated. The cycle of the stages is quite complex. Each phase in making a
particular decision is itself a complex decision making process [22]. For example, the
design phase may call for further Intelligence, and any phase can generate new problems
which themselves have Intelligence, Design and Choice phases.

<-----Page 2----->One of the central themes of descriptive decision making literature is the idea of
Bounded Rationality, also known as Limited Rationality which was first proposed by
Simon [19]. The basic tenet of Bounded Rationality is that all intendedly rational
behaviour occurs within constraints, including cognitive ones [17]. Rational behaviour is
typified by a decision maker who has a “well-organised and stable system of preferences
and a skill in computation that enables him to calculate, for the alternative courses of
action that are available to him, which of these will permit him to reach the highest
attainable point on his preference scale” [19]. Simon first made mention of human
“physiological and psychological limitations” in his work on rational choice [19]. He
states “the maximum speed at which an organism can move establishes a boundary on the
set of its available behaviour alternatives”, which interprets simply to mean, humans have
limits which they cannot exceed.
A central distinction among different decision making strategies (theories/models) is
the extent to which they make trades-offs among attributes [15]. A model is deemed
Non-Compensatory if “surpluses on subsequent dimensions cannot compensate for
deficiencies uncovered at an early stage of the evaluation process; since the alternative
will have already been eliminated” [17]. What this means is that those models which
screen or eliminate alternatives through sequential comparison or assessment of their
attributes are classified as being Non-Compensatory if, once they have been eliminated
based upon the single attribute evaluation, they cannot be assessed on any other attribute
regardless of their performance on these subsequent attributes. Conversely, being
Compensatory “implies that a decision maker will trade-off between a high value on one
dimension of an alternative and a low value on another dimension.” [16]. The most
common Compensatory model is the Additive Model [25] which is described later.
Descriptive models are generally Non-Compensatory while Prescriptive and Normative
models are typically regarded as being Compensatory.
Another useful comparative measure of descriptive decision making theories involves
determining whether they employ Holistic or Non-Holistic evaluative strategies. Holistic
simply refers to looking at a subject as a whole rather than a number of components. It
may, however, involve a more detailed analysis in order to obtain some overall value or
measure. In behavioural choice theory, a Holistic model is one which assesses or
compares an alternative or situation1 as a single item and evaluates each alternative in a
non-sequential manner. In contrast, a Non-Holistic model is one that compares or
evaluates an alternative on an attribute-by-attribute basis. This may involve looking at
every minute detail of a particular alternative and comparing it with another alternative
or some threshold, a threshold being a maximum or minimum value with which a given
attribute must reach or exceed.
2.2 Descriptive Models
Possibly the oldest descriptive theory is the Satisficing model, which emerged around the
same time, and is linked, to the idea of Bounded Rationality. First reported by Simon
[20], this theory posits that decision makers choose an alternative that exceeds some
criterion or standard. Behaviour of organisations in learning and choice situations fall far
short of the idea of “maximising” postulated in economic theory, “… organisations adapt
well enough to satisfice, they do not, in general, optimise” [20]. Simon’s argument is
1

In this paper, a situation is defined as the nature, type and environment of a decision problem.

<-----Page 3----->centred around the fact that decision makers do not and cannot maximise in most
situations.
Cohen et al., [3] developed the Garbage Can model in response to what they termed
organised anarchies. Organised anarchies, also referred to as decision situations, are
characterised by three general properties: Problematic Preferences, Unclear Technology
and Fluid Participation. Within an organised anarchy, it is difficult to assign preferences
to a specific decision problem. This is due, in part, to the fact that the organisation
consists of a loose, ill-defined group of ideas rather than a clear set of preferences. The
organised anarchy is characterised by its ambiguous operating procedures and a “learn
from our mistakes” philosophy. The Garbage Can model is fundamentally distinct from
other published descriptive theories. When most decision situations arise, conventional
practice is to determine the most appropriate action by whatever means. Garbage Can
theory states that the organised anarchy is faced with a number of choices, for which
compatible problems are sought. “To understand processes within an organisation, one
can view a choice opportunity as a garbage can into which various kinds of problems and
solutions are dumped by participants as they are generated. [3].
A relatively modern theory is that of Image Theory developed by Beach and Mitchell
over a period of twelve years. Based around the Lexicographic model [24] and the
Strategy Selection model [1], Image Theory is a refinement and synthesis of existing
ideas applied to real world decision problems. Image Theory attempts to describe two
types to decision making: Progress Decisions, about whether past decisions are being
adequately carried out and, Adoption Decisions, making decisions to replace incorrect
or unachievable decisions made previously.
Einhorn [7], describes the Conjunctive/Disjunctive model as a combination model in
that it works by combining information. The Conjunctive/Disjunctive model has been
proposed by a number of authors e.g. [4], [5], and [7]. The Conjunctive model looks to
select a solution or a group of potential solutions from a list of alternatives. All
alternatives which exceed some threshold or aspiration level become part of this group.
Those alternatives which do not exceed this level are eliminated. The Disjunctive model
evaluates each alternative with respect to its best attribute rather than all of them. The
Conjunctive/Disjunctive models have a similar philosphy to that of Simon’s [19]
Satisficing model. Rather than try to get the optimal solution, it searches for an adequate
solution or solutions. This is achieved by installing either a minimum evaluation function
(in the case of the Conjunctive model) or a maximum evaluation function (Disjunctive
model).
The naming of the Lexicographic model [25] is derived from the word Lexicon and
refers to the ordering of the dimensions of alternatives. The premise for the use of this
model is that the decision maker must know of the dimensions (attributes) which make
up the alternatives, and must be able to rank them in terms of their importance. This is
because each pair of alternatives is compared in terms of each attribute beginning with
that deemed as most important, until dominance of one over the other occurs.
Tversky [24], presents a probabilistic model of choice, the Elimination By Aspects
(EBA) model which is related to the Lexicographic model in that they both follow
intradimensional evaluation strategies [8][15]. Its principal activity is a covert
elimination process. Each alternative is viewed as a set of aspects which are sequentially
evaluated.
In more recent times, Klein [10] has proposed the Recognition Primed Decisions
(RPD) model as a descriptive model of decision making in natural settings; a natural

<-----Page 4----->setting being within some organisational or real life context. The RPD model was
developed based on the observation and questioning of 150 professional decision makers.
The RPD model contains four major components: Recognising cases as typical,
Situational understanding, Serial evaluation and, Mental simulation. The four parts of
the RPD model are typically employed in a sequential manner and involve revisiting and
comparing previous decisions along with simulating how various options might be
carried out and what their outcomes might be.
Two models regularly mentioned in the descriptive literature, also warrant attention.
The Additive and Additive Difference models are considered by many to be descriptive
e.g., [17]. These models are thought to be good approximations of multiattribute
decision behaviour in risk free situations [17], yet are more commonly used by
researchers as tools to predict judgements of various experts such as clinical
diagnosticians and stockbrokers [6][23]. The Additive Model of choice independently
and individually evaluates multidimensional alternatives. It considers each alternative,
one at a time, and determines, by whatever means, its rating or performance before going
on to the next alternative. The alternatives can then be holistically compared to
determine the best. The Additive Difference Model [25], is “based on comparisons of
component-wise differences between the alternatives”. These comparisons are pair-wise,
i.e., they only involve two alternatives at a time. Simply, alternatives are compared over
one dimension at a time. Each comparison is multiplied by the difference function
(weighting) which determines the advantage or disadvantage for that alternative on that
dimension. These advantages and disadvantages are finally summed for both alternatives
over every dimension in order to get the final subjective value for that alternative with
respect to the one with which it has been compared.
2.3 Synthesising Descriptive Theories
The development of descriptive theories of choice has been one of building on what has
gone before. In addition to the development of these models, several authors have
developed frameworks with the objective being to better understand and compare
existing descriptive theories. Lipshitz [11] proposed that human decision processes
comprise at least one of three modes: consequential choice, matching and reassessment.
These three modes form an argument-driven integrative framework where the decision
making actions are categorised by argument rather than forward-looking choice.
Lipshitz [11] posits that traditional choice theory, i.e., choosing from a number of
alternatives, rarely describes accurately how decisions are actually made.
Schoemaker [17] presented a “schematic overview of the various classes of
descriptive models that have been proposed”. Schoemaker made an initial distinction
between models being either Holistic or Non-Holistic. The Non-Holistic models were
then classified based on the type of comparison that occurred within each. The three
types of comparison are: against some standard, across attributes and, within attributes.

3 A New Framework of Descriptive Theories
All decision making activities include at various stages some form of comparison. These
principally include: comparisons between alternatives; comparisons between decision
situations and; comparisons between the attributes of different alternatives. The principal
distinction within the framework proposed below (Figure 2), is between situation and

<-----Page 5----->non-situation comparisons. Situation comparisons include comparisons between
situations and comparisons between situations and alternatives. The non-situation
comparisons are of three forms: comparisons between alternatives (or the attributes of
alternatives) and a standard; between alternatives and; between attributes of different
alternatives. Several of the identified descriptive models contain multiple forms of
comparison. In general, those models that contain multiple forms of comparison are
typically compensatory (with the exception of the Lexicographic model).
This framework presents little new information, however it does offer a fresh, new
view of existing descriptive theories. It provides an instrument for the evaluation and
comparison of these theories with respect to their appropriateness in prescribing their
use. It allows the similarities to be identified, along with the identification of the possible
reasons for their use (or non-use) by real decision makers.

2. Framework of Descriptive Theories

4 Observed Decision Making Behaviour
As a means of complementing the existing literature, 23 senior mangers from a New
Zealand based local authority were interview about their decision making. The objective
was to establish the degree to which the behaviour presented in the literature was
occurring within a New Zealand decision making environment. Each interview
participant was given approximately one hour in which to describe their decision making
approach to both work and private decisions. They were also asked to describe a
‘typical’decision they had recently made. An overview of the more significant results is
presented below.
4.1 Compensatory and Holistic Behaviour
All participants were compared with respect to their compensatory and holistic decision
making behaviour. These comparisons were made with respect to the participants entire

<-----Page 6----->decision making behaviour, both personal and professional. Results are presented in
Figure 3. The models have also been included to indicate where much of the behaviour
occurs. Participants who displayed or described behaviour consistent with one of the
descriptive models have been positioned over that model. Use of more than one model
by a single participant is represented by a dashed line between the relevant models.
Those for which it was impossible to identify any behaviour consistent with one or more
of the described models were assigned Holistic andCompensatory scores by the author.
Scores on each range from 0 ( entirely Non-Holistic or Non-Compensatory) to 10
(entirely Holistic or Compensatory).

3. Classification Scheme for Descriptive Models
(û=Placement of individuals in relation to descriptive models)
Looking firstly at the placement of the models, the majority (as expected) fall into the
Non-Compensatory category, with only the composite models, and the more
questionable descriptive models deemed as being Compensatory. The Holistic/NonHolistic split is more even, distinguished by the sequential processes of the Non-Holistic
models and the non-sequential processes of the Holistic models. As can be seen in
Figure 3, 15 out of the 23 participants (65%) typically follow holistic strategies, which is
consistent with what recent authors have noted [1][10][11]. The mix between
Compensatory and Non-Compensatory behaviour however was more even, which
suggests, for whatever reason, neither Compensatory nor Non-Compensatory decision
making predominates in the local governmentdecision making environment. The high
number (13) of participants who described behaviour consistent with the RPD model, the
Garbage Can model, and Satisficing gives support for the tenet of Bounded Rationality.
These three models all follow very simplified processes in which adequate solutions are
sought as opposed to optimal ones.
4.2 Analytical Decision Making
Certain types of decision problem require particular approaches to decision making. For
example, structured problems are typically well suited to the application of structured
decision processes. In a similar vein, analytical decisions are best approached by way of
an analytical decision strategy. Observations made in this study challenge this view. The
results of this part of the investigation are taken from the decisions described by each of
the participants; therefore the results can not be generalised. Each decision described

<-----Page 7----->was assigned a score between 1 and 10, where a 1 indicated a non-analytical problem and
a 10 represented a completely analytical problem. The approach taken by the decision
makers was also assessed in this way. Figure 4 presents the results of this part of the
study. If we introduce the hypothesis that decisions are made in a way that is consistent
with the nature of the decision problem, then the lightly shaded quadrants of Figure 4
support the hypothesis while the darker quadrants do not.

4. Analytic and Non-Analytic Decision Strategies
In summarising the results, 61% of participants approached the decision in a manner,
thought by the author, to be consistent with the problem type. The resulting group
contained two distinct groups of decision maker, both of which gave little consideration
to the problem type. The first group contained those who approached the problem in the
way that appeared best at the time, where as the second group contained those who
approached all decisions in either an analytic or non-analytic manner. Because only one
decision from each participant was analysed, we cannot be certain that the above figures
may be accurate for all decisions.

5 Summary and Implications for Prescription
The summarised empirical results do little to support the descriptive research to date,
especially with respect to the earlier work. Early researchers were consumed with
producing descriptive theories for which all observed decision making could be
described. More recently, it is increasingly acknowledged that the vast array of decision
making styles and environments makes developing such a theory unachievable. Authors
such as Shafir et al. [18] and Kahneman and Tversky [9] recognised that accurate
descriptive models were possible, but only in describing isolated types of decisions such
as choices between monetary lotteries. In addition these theories were purported only to
be able to predict the chosen alternative rather than describe the process. The results of
this study emphasise the role Bounded Rationality plays in individual decision making.
The value of work such as this lies in the development of better decision techniques
and aids for the less than rational decision maker. An understanding of the decision
makers behaviour, and more specifically, the reasons for such behaviour, is useful in the
advancement of managerial decision making. There is likely to be certain types of
decision behaviour that are always going to be present in unaided decision making.
Rather than trying to remove some of these apparent inhibitors to “good” decision
making, we need to use them to help in the development of more appropriate
prescriptive decision making methods.
