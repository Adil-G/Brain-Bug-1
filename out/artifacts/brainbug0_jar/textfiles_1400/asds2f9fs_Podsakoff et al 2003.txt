Interest in the problem of method biases has a long history in the behavioral sciences. Despite this, a
comprehensive summary of the potential sources of method biases and how to control for them does not
exist. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to examine the extent to which method biases influence
behavioral research results, identify potential sources of method biases, discuss the cognitive processes
through which method biases influence responses to measures, evaluate the many different procedural
and statistical techniques that can be used to control method biases, and provide recommendations for
how to select appropriate procedural and statistical remedies for different types of research settings.

Most researchers agree that common method variance (i.e.,
variance that is attributable to the measurement method rather than
to the constructs the measures represent) is a potential problem in
behavioral research. In fact, discussions of the potential impact of
common method biases date back well over 40 years (cf. Campbell
& Fiske, 1959), and interest in this issue appears to have continued
relatively unabated to the present day (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1990;
Bagozzi, Yi, & Phillips, 1991; Campbell & O’Connell, 1982;
Conway, 1998; Cote & Buckley, 1987, 1988; Kline, Sulsky, &
Rever-Moriyama, 2000; Lindell & Brandt, 2000; Lindell & Whitney, 2001; Millsap, 1990; Parker, 1999; Schmitt, Nason, Whitney,
& Pulakos, 1995; Scullen, 1999; Williams & Anderson, 1994;
Williams & Brown, 1994).
Method biases are a problem because they are one of the main
sources of measurement error. Measurement error threatens the
validity of the conclusions about the relationships between measures and is widely recognized to have both a random and a
systematic component (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1991; Nunnally, 1978;
Spector, 1987). Although both types of measurement error are
problematic, systematic measurement error is a particularly serious
problem because it provides an alternative explanation for the
observed relationships between measures of different constructs
that is independent of the one hypothesized. Bagozzi and Yi (1991)
noted that one of the main sources of systematic measurement
error is method variance that may arise from a variety of sources:

such as the content of specific items, scale type, response format, and
the general context (Fiske, 1982, pp. 81– 84). At a more abstract level,
method effects might be interpreted in terms of response biases such
as halo effects, social desirability, acquiescence, leniency effects, or
yea- and nay-saying. (p. 426)

However, regardless of its source, systematic error variance can
have a serious confounding influence on empirical results, yielding
potentially misleading conclusions (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). For
example, let’s assume that a researcher is interested in studying a
hypothesized relationship between Constructs A and B. Based on
theoretical considerations, one would expect that the measures of
Construct A would be correlated with measures of Construct B.
However, if the measures of Construct A and the measures of
Construct B also share common methods, those methods may exert
a systematic effect on the observed correlation between the measures. Thus, at least partially, common method biases pose a rival
explanation for the correlation observed between the measures.
Within the above context, the purpose of this research is to (a)
examine the extent to which method biases influence behavioral
research results, (b) identify potential sources of method biases, (c)
discuss the cognitive processes through which method biases influence responses to measures, (d) evaluate the many different
procedural and statistical techniques that can be used to control
method biases, and (e) provide recommendations for how to select
appropriate procedural and statistical remedies for different types
of research settings. This is important because, to our knowledge,
there is no comprehensive discussion of all of these issues available in the literature, and the evidence suggests that many researchers are not effectively controlling for this source of bias.

Method variance refers to variance that is attributable to the measurement method rather than to the construct of interest. The term method
refers to the form of measurement at different levels of abstraction,

Over the past few decades, a considerable amount of evidence
has accumulated regarding the extent to which method variance
influences (a) measures used in the field and (b) relationships
between these measures. Much of the evidence of the extent to
which method variance is present in measures used in behavioral
research comes from meta-analyses of multitrait–multimethod
879

880

studies (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1990; Cote & Buckley, 1987, 1988;
Williams, Cote, & Buckley, 1989). Perhaps the most comprehensive evidence comes from Cote and Buckley (1987), who examined the amount of common method variance present in measures
across 70 MTMM studies in the psychology–sociology, marketing,
business, and education literatures. They found that approximately
one quarter (26.3%) of the variance in a typical research measure
might be due to systematic sources of measurement error like
common method biases. However, they also found that the amount
of variance attributable to method biases varied considerably by
discipline and by the type of construct being investigated. For
example, Cote and Buckley (1987) found that, on average, method
variance was lowest in the field of marketing (15.8%) and highest
in the field of education (30.5%). They also found that typical job
performance measures contained an average of 22.5% method
variance, whereas attitude measures contain an average of 40.7%.
A similar pattern of findings emerges from Williams et al.’s (1989)
study of just the applied psychology literature.
In addition to these estimates of the extent to which method
variance is present in typical measures, there is also a growing
body of research examining the extent to which method variance
influences relationships between measures (cf. Fuller, Patterson,
Hester, & Stringer, 1996; Gerstner & Day, 1997; Lowe, Kroeck, &
Sivasubramaniam, 1996; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000; Wagner & Gooding, 1987). These studies contrasted
the strength of the relationship between two variables when common method variance was controlled versus when it was not. They
found that, on average, the amount of variance accounted for when
common method variance was present was approximately 35%
versus approximately 11% when it was not present. Thus, there is
a considerable amount of evidence that common method variance
can have a substantial effect on observed relationships between
measures of different constructs. However, it is important to recognize that the findings suggest that the magnitude of the bias

produced by these method factors varies across research contexts
(cf. Cote & Buckley, 1987; Crampton & Wagner, 1994).
Not only can the strength of the bias vary but so can the
direction of its effect. Method variance can either inflate or deflate
observed relationships between constructs, thus leading to both
Type I and Type II errors. This point is illustrated in Table 1,
which uses Cote and Buckley’s (1987) estimates of the average
amount of trait variance, the average amount of method variance,
and the average method intercorrelations and inserts them into the
equation below to calculate the impact of common method variance on the observed correlation between measures of different
types of constructs (e.g., attitude, personality, aptitude):
Rx, y ⫽ (true Rti, tj 冑tx 冑ty) ⫹ (true Rmk, ml 冑mx 冑my),

(1)

where true Rti, tj is the average correlation between trait i and trait
j, tx is the percent of trait variance in measure x, ty is the percent
of trait variance in measure y, true Rmk, ml is the average correlation
between method k and method l, mx is the percent of method
variance in measure x, and my is the percent of method variance in
measure y.
For example, the correlation .52 in the second row of the first
column of Table 1 was calculated by multiplying the true correlation (1.00) times the square root of Cote and Buckley’s (1987)
estimate of the percent of trait variance typically found in attitude
measures (冑.298) times the square root of their estimate of the
percent of trait variance typically found in personality measures
(冑.391) plus the average of their estimates of the typical correlation
between methods for attitude (.556) and personality (.546) constructs multiplied by the square root of their estimate of the percent
of method variance typically found in attitude measures (冑.407)
times the square root of their estimate of the percent of method
variance typically found in personality measures (冑.247).

Note. Values within the table are the observed correlations Rx, y (and squared correlations Rx, y2) calculated using Cote and Buckley’s (1988) formula
shown in Equation 1 of the text. For the calculations it is assumed that (a) the trait variance is the same as that reported by Cote and Buckley (1987) for
each type of construct (e.g., attitude measures ⫽ .298, personality measures ⫽ .391, aptitude measures ⫽ .395, and job performance and satisfaction
measures ⫽ .465), (b) the method variance is the same as that reported by Cote and Buckley (1987) for each type of construct (e.g., attitude measures ⫽
.407, personality measures ⫽ .247, aptitude measures ⫽ .251, and job performance and satisfaction measures ⫽ .225), and (c) the correlation between the
methods is the average of the method correlations reported by Cote and Buckley (1987) for each of the constructs (e.g., method correlations between
attitude–attitude constructs ⫽ .556, personality–attitude constructs ⫽ .551, personality–personality constructs ⫽ .546, aptitude–attitude constructs ⫽ .564,
aptitude–personality constructs ⫽ .559, aptitude–aptitude constructs ⫽ .572, job performance and satisfaction–attitude constructs ⫽ .442, job performance
and satisfaction–personality constructs ⫽ .437, job performance and satisfaction–aptitude constructs ⫽ .450, and job performance and satisfaction–job
performance and satisfaction constructs ⫽ .328). These calculations ignore potential Trait ⫻ Method interactions.

<-----Page 2----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

There are several important conclusions that can be drawn from
Table 1. For example, the entry in the first column of the first row
indicates that even though two attitude constructs are perfectly
correlated, the observed correlation between their measures is only
.52 because of measurement error. Similarly, the entry in the last
column of the first row indicates that even though two attitude
constructs are completely uncorrelated, the observed correlation
between their measures is .23 because of random and systematic
measurement error. Both of these numbers are troubling but for
different reasons. The entries in the entire first column are troubling because they show that even though two traits are perfectly
correlated, typical levels of measurement error cut the observed
correlation between their measures in half and the variance explained by 70%. The last column of entries is troubling because it
shows that even when two constructs are completely uncorrelated,
measurement error causes the observed correlation between their
measures to be greater than zero. Indeed, some of these numbers
are not very different from the effect sizes reported in the behavioral literature. In view of this, it is disturbing that most studies
ignore measurement error entirely and that even many of the ones
that do try to take random measurement error into account ignore
systematic measurement error. Thus, measurement error can inflate or deflate the observed correlation between the measures,
depending on the correlation between the methods. Indeed, as
noted by Cote and Buckley (1988), method effects inflate the
observed relationship when the correlation between the methods is
higher than the observed correlation between the measures with
method effects removed and deflate the relationship when the
correlation between the methods is lower than the observed correlation between the measures with method effects removed.

Potential Sources of Common Method Biases
Because common method biases can have potentially serious
effects on research findings, it is important to understand their
sources and when they are especially likely to be a problem.
Therefore, in the next sections of the article, we identify several of
the most likely causes of method bias and the research settings in
which they are likely to pose particular problems. As shown in
Table 2, some sources of common method biases result from the
fact that the predictor and criterion variables are obtained from the
same source or rater, whereas others are produced by the measurement items themselves, the context of the items within the measurement instrument, and/or the context in which the measures are
obtained.

Method Effects Produced by a Common Source or Rater
Some methods effects result from the fact that the respondent
providing the measure of the predictor and criterion variable is the
same person. This type of self-report bias may be said to result
from any artifactual covariance between the predictor and criterion
variable produced by the fact that the respondent providing the
measure of these variables is the same.
Consistency motif. There is a substantial amount of theory (cf.
Heider, 1958; Osgood & Tannenbaum, 1955) and research (cf.
McGuire, 1966) suggesting that people try to maintain consistency
between their cognitions and attitudes. Thus, it should not be
surprising that people responding to questions posed by researchers would have a desire to appear consistent and rational in their

881

responses and might search for similarities in the questions asked
of them—thereby producing relationships that would not otherwise exist at the same level in real-life settings. This tendency of
respondents to try to maintain consistency in their responses to
similar questions or to organize information in consistent ways is
called the consistency motif (Johns, 1994; Podsakoff & Organ,
1986; Schmitt, 1994) or the consistency effect (Salancik & Pfeffer,
1977) and is likely to be particularly problematic in those situations in which respondents are asked to provide retrospective
accounts of their attitudes, perceptions, and/or behaviors.
Implicit theories and illusory correlations. Related to the notion of the consistency motif as a potential source of common
method variance are illusory correlations (cf. Berman & Kenny,
1976; Chapman & Chapman, 1967, 1969; Smither, Collins, &
Buda, 1989), and implicit theories (cf. Lord, Binning, Rush, &
Thomas, 1978; Phillips & Lord, 1986; Staw, 1975). Berman and
Kenny (1976) have indicated that illusory correlations result from
the fact that “raters often appear to possess assumptions concerning the co-occurrence of rated items, and these assumptions may
introduce systematic distortions when correlations are derived
from the ratings” (p. 264); Smither et al. (1989) have noted that
these “illusory correlations may serve as the basis of job schema or
implicit theories held by raters and thereby affect attention to and
encoding of ratee behaviors as well as later recall” (p. 599). This
suggests that correlations derived from ratees’ responses are composed of not only true relationships but also artifactual covariation
based on ratees’ implicit theories.
Indeed, there is a substantial amount of evidence that implicit
theories do have an effect on respondents’ ratings in a variety of
different domains, including ratings of leader behavior (e.g., Eden
& Leviatin, 1975; Lord et al., 1978; Phillips & Lord, 1986),
attributions of the causes of group performance (cf. Guzzo, Wagner, Maguire, Herr, & Hawley, 1986; Staw, 1975), and perceptions
about the relationship between employee satisfaction and performance (Smither et al., 1989). Taken together, these findings indicate that the relationships researchers observe between predictor
and criterion variables on a questionnaire may not only reflect the
actual covariation that exists between these events but may also be
the result of the implicit theories that respondents have regarding
the relationship between these events.
Social desirability. According to Crowne and Marlowe
(1964), social desirability “refers to the need for social approval
and acceptance and the belief that it can be attained by means of
culturally acceptable and appropriate behaviors” (p. 109). It is
generally viewed as the tendency on the part of individuals to
present themselves in a favorable light, regardless of their true
feelings about an issue or topic. This tendency is problematic, not
only because of its potential to bias the answers of respondents
(i.e., to change the mean levels of the response) but also because
it may mask the true relationships between two or more variables
(Ganster, Hennessey & Luthans, 1983). Ganster et al. (1983) have
noted that social desirability can produce spurious relationships,
serve as a suppressor variable that hides the true relationship
between variables, or serve as a moderator variable that influences
the nature of the relationships between the variables.
Leniency biases. Guilford (1954, p. 278) has defined leniency
biases as the tendency for raters “to rate those whom they know
well, or whom they are ego involved, higher than they should.”
Research on this form of bias (Schriesheim, Kinicki, &

respondent providing the measure of these variables is the same.
Refers to the propensity for respondents to try to maintain consistency in their responses to questions.
Refer to respondents’ beliefs about the covariation among particular traits, behaviors, and/or outcomes.
Refers to the tendency of some people to respond to items more as a result of their social acceptability than
their true feelings.
Refer to the propensity for respondents to attribute socially desirable traits, attitudes, and/or behaviors to
someone they know and like than to someone they dislike.
Refer to the propensity for respondents to agree (or disagree) with questionnaire items independent of their
content.
Refers to the propensity of respondents to view themselves and the world around them in generally negative
terms (negative affectivity) or the propensity of respondents to view themselves and the world around
them in generally positive terms (positive affectivity).
Refers to the impact of relatively recent mood-inducing events to influence the manner in which respondents
view themselves and the world around them.
Refer to any artifactual covariance that is caused by the influence or interpretation that a respondent might
ascribe to an item solely because of specific properties or characteristics the item possesses.
Refers to the fact that items may be written in such a way as to reflect more socially desirable attitudes,
behaviors, or perceptions.
Refer to the fact that items may convey hidden cues as to how to respond to them.
Refers to the fact that items that are ambiguous allow respondents to respond to them systematically using
their own heuristic or respond to them randomly.
Refer to artifactual covariation produced by the use of the same scale format (e.g., Likert scales, semantic
differential scales, “faces” scales) on a questionnaire.
Refer to the repeated use of the same anchor points (e.g., extremely, always, never) on a questionnaire.
Refers to the fact that the use of positively (negatively) worded items may produce artifactual relationships

relation to the other items making up an instrument (Wainer & Kiely, 1987).
Refer to the fact that the positioning of the predictor (or criterion) variable on the questionnaire can make
that variable more salient to the respondent and imply a causal relationship with other variables.
Refers to the fact that neutral items embedded in the context of either positively or negatively worded items
will take on the evaluative properties of those items.
Refers to when the first question (or set of questions) encountered on the questionnaire induces a mood for
responding to the remainder of the questionnaire.
Refers to the fact that if scales have fewer items, responses to previous items are more likely to be
accessible in short-term memory and to be recalled when responding to other items.
Refers to the fact that items from different constructs that are grouped together may decrease intraconstruct
correlations and increase interconstruct correlations.
Refer to any artifactual covariation produced from the context in which the measures are obtained.
Refers to the fact that measures of different constructs measured at the same point in time may produce
artifactual covariance independent of the content of the constructs themselves.
Refers to the fact that measures of different constructs measured in the same location may produce
artifactual covariance independent of the content of the constructs themselves.
Refers to the fact that measures of different constructs measured with the same medium may produce
artifactual covariance independent of the content of the constructs themselves.

Schriesheim, 1979) has shown that it produces spurious correlations
between leader-consideration behavior and employee satisfaction and
perceptions of group productivity, drive, and cohesiveness but not
between leader initiating structure behavior and these same criterion
variables. This suggests that the consideration scale is not socially
neutral and that leniency biases tend to influence the relationships
obtained between this scale and employee attitudes and perceptions.
One might also expect leniency biases to produce spurious correlations in other studies that examine the relationship between respondents’ ratings of liked (or disliked) others and the respondents’ ratings
of the performance, attitudes, and perceptions of others.

Acquiescence (yea-saying or nay-saying). Winkler, Kanouse,
and Ware (1982, p. 555) have defined acquiescence response set
as the “tendency to agree with attitude statements regardless of
content” and have noted that this response set is problematic
“because it heightens the correlations among items that are worded
similarly, even when they are not conceptually related.” Although
Winkler et al. (1982) focused specific attention on the effects of
acquiescence on scale development processes, it is easy to see how
this form of bias might also cause spurious relationships between
two or more constructs. Thus, acquiescence may also be a potential
cause of artifactual variance in the relationships between two or

<-----Page 4----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

more variables, other than the true variance between these
variables.
Positive and negative affectivity. Waston and Clark (1984)
defined negative affectivity as a mood-dispositional dimension that
reflects pervasive individual differences in negative emotionality
and self-concept and positive affectivity as reflecting pervasive
individual differences in positive emotionality and self-concept.
On the basis of their extensive review of the literature, Watson and
Clark concluded that people who express high negative affectivity
view themselves and a variety of aspects of the world around them
in generally negative terms. Burke, Brief, and George (1993) drew
similar conclusions regarding the potential impact of positive
affectivity. They noted that,
Self-reports of negative features of the work situation and negative
affective reactions may both be influenced by negative affectivity,
whereas self-reports of positive aspects of the work situation and
positive affective reactions may both be influenced by positive affectivity. (Burke et al., 1993, p. 410)

If these dispositions influence respondents’ ratings on selfreport questionnaires, it is possible that negative (positive) affectivity could account for systematic variance in the relationships
obtained between two or more variables that is different from the
actual (true) score variance that exists between these variables.
Indeed, Brief, Burke, George, Robinson, and Webster (1988) reported that negative affectivity inflated the relationships obtained
between expressions of employee stress and their expressions of
job and life satisfaction, depression, and the amount of negative
affect experienced at work, and Williams and Anderson (1994)
reported that their structural equation models specifying the relationships between leader contingent reward behavior and job satisfaction and commitment fit significantly better when their measure of positive affectivity was included in the model than when it
was excluded from the model. In contrast, Chen and Spector
(1991) and Jex and Spector (1996) found little support for the
influence of negative affectivity on the relationships between
self-reported job stress and job strain variables. Although these
contradictory findings have led to a fairly lively debate (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1990; Spector, 1987; Williams et al., 1989), taken as
a whole, they appear to indicate that positive and negative affectivity may influence the relationships between variables in organizational research.
Transient mood state. Positive and negative affectivity are
generally considered to be fairly enduring trait characteristics of
the individual that may influence their responses to questionnaires.
However, it is also possible that the transient mood states of
respondents produced from any of a number of events (e.g.,
interaction with a disgruntled customer, receiving a compliment
from a co-worker or boss, receiving word of a promotion, death of
a close friend or family member, a bad day at the office, concerns
about downsizing) may also produce artifactual covariance in
self-report measures because the person responds to questions
about both the predictor and criterion variable while in a particular
mood.

Method Effects Produced by Item Characteristics
In addition to the bias that may be produced by obtaining
measures from the same source, it is also possible for the manner

883

in which items are presented to respondents to produce artifactual
covariance in the observed relationships. Cronbach (Cronbach,
1946, 1950) was probably the first to recognize the possibility that,
in addition to its content, an item’s form may also influence the
scores obtained on a measure:
A psychological test or educational test is constructed by choosing
items of the desired content, and refining them by empirical techniques. The assumption is generally made, and validated as well as
possible, that what the test measures is determined by the content of
the items. Yet the final score of the person on any test is a composite
of effects resulting from the content of the item and effects resulting
from the form of the item used. A test supposedly measuring one
variable may also be measuring another trait which would not influence the score if another type of item were used. (Cronbach, 1946, pp.
475– 476)

Although Cronbach’s (1946, 1950) discussion of response sets
tended to confound characteristics of the items of measurement
with personal tendencies on the part of respondents exposed to
those items, our focus in this section is on the potential effects that
item characteristics have on common method variance.
Item social desirability (or item demand characteristics).
Thomas and Kilmann (1975) and Nederhof (1985) have noted that,
in addition to the fact that social desirability may be viewed as a
tendency for respondents to behave in a culturally acceptable and
appropriate manner, it may also be viewed as a property of the
items in a questionnaire. As such, items or constructs on a questionnaire that possess more (as opposed to less) social desirability
may be observed to relate more (or less) to each other as much
because of their social desirability as they do because of the
underlying constructs that they are intended to measure. For example, Thomas and Kilmann (1975) reported that respondents’
self-reported ratings of their use of five different conflict-handling
modes of behavior correlated strongly with the rated social desirability of these modes of behavior. Thus, social desirability at the
item (and/or construct) level is also a potential cause of artifactual
variance in questionnaire research.
Item complexity and/or ambiguity. Although researchers are
encouraged to develop items that are as clear, concise, and specific
as possible to measure the constructs they are interested in (cf.
Peterson, 2000; Spector, 1992), it is not uncommon for some items
to be fairly complex or ambiguous. Undoubtedly, some of the
complexity that exists in questionnaire measures results from the
fact that some constructs are fairly complex or abstract in nature.
However, in other cases, item complexity or ambiguity may result
from the use of double-barreled questions (cf. Hinkin, 1995),
words with multiple meanings (Peterson, 2000), technical jargon
or colloquialisms (Spector, 1992), or unfamiliar or infrequently
used words (Peterson, 2000). The problem with ambiguous items
is that they often require respondents to develop their own idiosyncratic meanings for them. This may either increase random
responding or increase the probability that respondents’ own systematic response tendencies (e.g., implicit theories, affectivity,
central tendency and leniency biases) may come into play. For
example, Gioia and Sims (1985) reported that implicit leadership
theories are more likely to influence respondents’ ratings when the
leader behaviors being rated are less behaviorally specific than
when the leader behaviors being rated are more behaviorally
specific. Thus, in addition to item content, the level of item

<-----Page 5----->884

PODSAKOFF, MACKENZIE, LEE, AND PODSAKOFF

ambiguity and complexity may also influence the relationships
obtained between the variables of interest in a study.
Scale format and scale anchors. It is not uncommon for researchers to measure different constructs with similar scale formats (e.g., Likert scales, semantic differential scales, “faces”
scales), using similar scale anchors or values (“extremely” vs.
“somewhat,” “always” vs. “never,” and “strongly agree” vs.
“strongly disagree”). Although it may be argued that the use of
similar scale formats and anchors makes it easier for the respondents to complete the questionnaire because it provides a standardized format and therefore requires less cognitive processing, this
may also increase the possibility that some of the covariation
observed among the constructs examined may be the result of the
consistency in the scale properties rather than the content of the
items. For example, it is well known in the survey research
literature (Tourangeau, Rips, & Rasinski, 2000) that scale format
and anchors systematically influence responses.
Negatively worded (reverse-coded) items. Some researchers
have attempted to reduce the potential effects of response pattern
biases by incorporating negatively worded or reverse-coded items
on their questionnaires (cf. Hinkin, 1995; Idaszak & Drasgow,
1987). The basic logic here is that reverse-coded items are like
cognitive “speed bumps” that require respondents to engage in
more controlled, as opposed to automatic, cognitive processing.
Unfortunately, research has shown that reverse-coded items may
produce artifactual response factors consisting exclusively of negatively worded items (Harvey, Billings, & Nilan, 1985) that may
disappear after the reverse-coded items are rewritten in a positive
manner (Idaszak & Drasgow, 1987). Schmitt and Stults (1986)
have argued that the effects of negatively worded items may occur
because once respondents establish a pattern of responding to a
questionnaire, they may fail to attend to the positive–negative
wording of the items. In addition, they have shown that factors
representing negatively worded items may occur in cases where as
few as 10% of the respondents fail to recognize that some items are
reverse coded. Thus, negatively worded items may be a source of
method bias.

Method Effects Produced by Item Context
Common method biases may also result from the context in
which the items on a questionnaire are placed. Wainer and Keily
(1987) have suggested that item context effects “refer to any
influence or interpretation that a subject might ascribe to an item
solely because of its relation to the other items making up an
instrument” (p. 187). In this section, we examine several potential
types of item context effects.
Item priming effects. Salancik and Pfeffer (1977) and Salancik
(1984) have noted that asking questions about particular features
of the work environment may make other work aspects more
salient to respondents than these work aspects would have been if
the questions had not been asked in the first place. They referred
to this increased salience as a “priming” effect and described it in
the context of the need–satisfaction models by noting that
If a person is asked to describe his job in terms that are of interest to
the investigator, he can do so. But if the individual is then asked how
he feels about the job, he has few options but to respond using the
information the investigator has made salient. The correlation between
job characteristics and attitudes from such a study is not only unre-

markable, but provides little information about the need–satisfaction
model. (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1977, p. 451)

Although the specific conditions identified by Salancik (1984)
as necessary to produce priming effects have been the subject of
some debate (cf. Salancik, 1982, 1984; Stone, 1984; Stone &
Gueutal, 1984), there is some evidence that priming effects may
occur in some instances (cf. Salancik, 1982). Thus, it is possible
for such effects to produce artifactual covariation among variables
under some conditions.
Item embeddedness. Harrison and McLaughlin (1993) have
argued that neutral items embedded in the context of either positively or negatively worded items take on the evaluative properties
of those items and that this process may subsequently influence the
observed covariation among these items. More specifically, they
noted that
item context can influence a respondent’s interpretation of a question,
retrieval of information from memory, judgment about that retrieved
information, and the selection of an appropriate item response. An
item’s context can cause cognitive carryover effects by influencing
any number of these processing stages. Carryover occurs when the
interpretation, retrieval, judgment, or response associated with prior
items provides a respondent with an easily accessible cognitive structure or schema, by bringing the cognitive structure into short-term
memory, into a temporary workspace, or to the top of the storage bin
of relevant information . . . A respondent then uses the easily accessible set of cognitions to answer subsequent items. Cognitive carryover can produce spurious response consistency in attitude surveys
in the same way it can produce illusory halo error in performance
ratings. (Harrison & McLaughlin, 1993, p. 131)

On the basis of these arguments regarding cognitive carryover
effects, Harrison and McLaughlin (1993) predicted and found that
evaluatively neutral items placed in blocks of positive (or negative) evaluative items were rated in a manner similar to the items
they were embedded within. Another example of item embeddedness effects is the “chameleon effect” noted by Marsh and Yeung
(1999). They found that answers to general self-esteem questions
(e.g., “I feel good about myself”) reflected the nature of the
surrounding questions. More specifically, they demonstrated that
the content-free esteem item could take on qualitatively different
meanings, depending on the context in which it appears. Thus, it
appears that the context in which neutral items are presented may
influence the manner in which these items are rated.
Context-induced mood. Earlier, we noted that respondents’
moods (whether stable or based on transient events) may influence
their responses to questionnaire items, independent of the content
of the items themselves. One factor that might produce transient
mood states on the part of respondents is the manner in which the
items on the questionnaire are worded (cf. Peterson, 2000). For
example, it is possible that the wording of the first set of items on
a questionnaire induces a mood on the part of respondents that
influences the manner in which they respond to the remaining
items on the questionnaire. Thus, items on a questionnaire that
raise respondents’ suspicions about the researcher’s intent or integrity or items that insult the respondent, because they relate to
ethnic, racial, or gender stereotypes, might predispose the respondent to complete the questionnaire with a negative mood state. It
is possible for these context-induced moods to produce artifactual
covariation among the constructs on the questionnaire.

<-----Page 6----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

Scale length. Harrison, McLaughlin, and Coalter (1996) have
noted that scales that contain fewer items increase respondents’
accessibility to answers to previous scales, thereby increasing the
likelihood that these previous responses influence answers to current scales. Their logic is that shorter scales minimize the decay of
previous responses in short-term memory, thereby enhancing the
observed relationships between scale items that are similar in
content. Therefore, although scales that are short in length have
some advantages in that they may reduce some forms of bias that
are produced by respondent fatigue and carelessness (cf. Hinkin,
1995), they may actually enhance other forms of bias because they
increase the possibility that responses to previous items on the
questionnaire will influence responses to current items.
Intermixing items of different constructs on the questionnaire.
It is not uncommon for researchers to intermix items from different
constructs on the same questionnaire. Indeed, Kline et al. (2000)
recommended this practice to reduce common method variance.
However, if the constructs on the questionnaire are similar (like
job characteristics and job satisfaction), one possible outcome of
this practice is that it may increase the interconstruct correlations
at the same time it decreases the intraconstruct correlations. This
would appear to suggest that intermixing items on a questionnaire
would produce artifactual covariation among the constructs.
However, the issue is probably more complex than it appears to
be on the surface. For example, at the same time that the intermixed items may increase the interconstruct correlations because
respondents have a more difficult time distinguishing between the
constructs, the reliability in the scales may be reduced because the
respondents have a more difficult time also seeing the similarity in
the items measuring the same construct. However, reducing the
reliability of the scales should have the effect of reducing (rather
than increasing) the covariation among the constructs. Thus, it is
difficult to tell how the countervailing effects of increasing interconstruct correlations at the same time as decreasing intraconstruct
correlations affects method variance. Therefore, it appears that
more attention needs to be directed at this issue before we can
really make definitive statements regarding the effects of mixed
versus grouped items on method variance.

Method Effects Produced by Measurement Context
A final factor that may influence the artifactual covariation
observed between constructs is the broader research context in
which the measures are obtained. Chief among these contextual
influences are the time, location, and media used to measure the
constructs.
Time and location of measurement. Measures of predictor and
criterion variables may be assessed concurrently or at different
times and places. To the extent that measures are taken at the same
time in the same place, they may share systematic covariation
because this common measurement context may (a) increase the
likelihood that responses to measures of the predictor and criterion
variables will co-exist in short-term memory, (b) provide contextual cues for retrieval of information from long-term memory, and
(c) facilitate the use of implicit theories when they exist.
Use of common medium to obtain measurement. One final
contextual factor that may produce artifactual covariation among
the predictor and criterion variables is the medium used to obtain
the responses. For example, interviewer characteristics, expecta-

885

tions, and verbal idiosyncrasies are well recognized in the survey
response literature as potential sources of method biases (cf. Bouchard, 1976; Collins, 1970; Shapiro, 1970). Similarly, research (cf.
Martin & Nagao, 1989; Richman, Kiesler, Weisband, & Drasgow,
1999) has shown that face-to-face interviews tend to induce more
socially desirable responding and lower accuracy than computeradministered questionnaires or paper-and-pencil questionnaires.
Thus, the medium used to gather data may be a source of common
method variance.

Summary of the Sources of Common Method Variance
In summary, common method biases arise from having a common rater, a common measurement context, a common item context, or from the characteristics of the items themselves. Obviously, in any given study, it is possible for several of these factors
to be operative. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the
conditions under which the data are obtained to assess the extent to
which method biases may be a problem. Method biases are likely
to be particularly powerful in studies in which the data for both the
predictor and criterion variable are obtained from the same person
in the same measurement context using the same item context and
similar item characteristics. These conditions are often present in
behavioral research. For example, Sackett and Larson (1990) reviewed every research study appearing in Journal of Applied
Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Personnel Psychology in 1977, 1982, and 1987 and
found that 51% (296 out of 577) of all the studies used some kind
of self-report measure as either the primary or sole type of data
gathered and were therefore subject to common rater biases. They
also found that 39% (222 out of 577) used a questionnaire or
interview methodology wherein all of the data were collected in
the same measurement context.

Processes Through Which Method Biases Influence
Respondent Behavior
Once the method biases that are likely to be present in a
particular situation have been identified, the next step is to develop
procedures to minimize their impact. However, to do this, one
must understand how these biases affect the response process.
Although there are many different models of how people generate
responses to questions (cf. Cannell, Miller, & Oksenberg, 1981;
Strack & Martin, 1987; Thurstone, 1927; Tourangeau et al., 2000),
there are several similarities with respect to the fundamental stages
they include. The first two columns of Table 3 show the most
commonly identified stages of the response process: comprehension, retrieval, judgment, response selection, and response reporting (cf. Strack & Martin, 1987; Sudman, Bradburn, & Schwarz,
1996; Tourangeau et al., 2000). In the comprehension stage, respondents attend to the questions and instructions they receive and
try to understand what the question is asking. The retrieval stage
involves generating a retrieval strategy and a set of cues that can
be used to recall relevant information from long-term memory.
However, because retrieval does not always yield an explicit
answer to the questions being asked, the next step is for the
respondent to assess the completeness and accuracy of their memories, draw inferences that fill in gaps in what is recalled, and
integrate the material retrieved into a single overall judgment of

how to respond. Once respondents have identified what they think
that the answer is, their next task is to decide how their answer
maps onto the appropriate scale or response option provided to
them. Following this, respondents either record their judgment on
the appropriate point on the scale or edit their responses for
consistency, acceptability, desirability, or other criteria. In describing these stages in the response process, we are not suggesting that
the response process is always highly conscious and deliberative.
Indeed, anyone who has observed people filling out questionnaires
would agree that all of these stages of this process might happen
very quickly in a more or less automatic manner.
In the third column of Table 3, we have identified the specific
method biases that are likely to have the biggest effects at each
stage of the response process. Several researchers (cf. Fowler,
1992; Torangeau et al., 2000) have noted that item ambiguity is
likely to be the biggest problem in the comprehension stage
because the more ambiguous the question is, the more difficult it
is for respondents to understand what they are being asked and
how to link the question to relevant concepts and information in
memory. A review of the literature by Sudman et al. (1996)
suggested that when faced with an ambiguous question, respondents often refer to the surrounding questions to infer the meaning
of the ambiguous one. This causes the answers to the surrounding
questions to be systematically related to the answer to the ambiguous question. Alternatively, when a question is highly ambiguous,
respondents may respond either systematically by using some
heuristic (e.g., some people may respond neutrally, whereas others
may agree or disagree) or randomly without using any heuristic at
all. To the extent that people rely on heuristics when responding to
ambiguous questions, it could increase common method variance
between an ambiguous predictor and an ambiguous criterion
variable.
There are several common method biases that may affect the
retrieval stage of the response process. These biases influence this
stage by providing common cues that influence what is retrieved
from memory and thereby influence the correlation between the
measures of the predictor and criterion variables. For example,

measuring both the predictor and criterion variable in the same
measurement context (in terms of time, location, position in the
questionnaire) can provide common contextual cues that influence
the retrieval of information from memory and the correlation
between the two measures (cf. Sudman et al., 1996). Mood is
another method bias affecting the retrieval stage of the response
process. A great deal of research indicates that transient mood
states and/or context-induced mood states influence the contents of
what is recalled from memory (cf. Blaney, 1986; Bower, 1981;
Isen & Baron, 1991; Parrott & Sabini, 1990). Some research has
shown mood-congruency effects on recall (Bower, 1981; Isen &
Baron, 1991), whereby an individual’s current mood state automatically primes similarly valenced material stored in memory,
and some has shown mood-incongruency effects (Parrott & Sabini,
1990) that are typically attributed to motivational factors. However, all of this research strongly supports the notion that mood
affects recall in a systematic manner. When this mood is induced
by the measurement context and/or when it is present when a
person responds to questions about both the predictor and criterion
variables, its biasing effects on retrieval are likely to be a source of
common method bias.
As indicated in Table 3, there are also several method biases that
affect the judgment stage of the response process. Some of these
affect the process of drawing inferences that fill in gaps in what is
recalled. For example, implicit theories may be used to fill in gaps
in what is recalled or to infer missing details from memory on the
basis of what typically happens. Similarly, item demand characteristics may prompt people who are uncertain about how to
respond on the basis of the cues present in the question itself.
Likewise, people may rely on a consistency motif to fill in the
missing information when faced with gaps in what is recalled or
uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the information recalled
from memory (e.g., “Since I remember doing X, I probably also
did Y”).
Other method biases may affect the judgment stage by influencing the process of making estimates based on the partial retrieval of information. For example, priming effects may influence

<-----Page 8----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

the judgment stage of the response process because answering
initial questions brings information into short-term memory that
remains accessible when responding to later questions (Judd,
Drake, Downing, & Krosnick, 1991; Salancik, 1984; Torangeau,
Rasinski, & D’Andrade, 1991). The same can be said for mood
produced by the item context. In general, when questions change
a respondent’s current mood by bringing positive or negative
material to mind, it is likely to affect subsequent judgments even
if the target of judgment is completely unrelated (Sudman et al.,
1996). Finally, in addition to item-context-induced mood, the item
context may also produce other experiences that affect subsequent
judgments. For example, respondents may find it easy or difficult
to answer specific questions, and this subjective experience alone
may be used as a heuristic for making subsequent judgments (cf.
Sudman et al., 1996).
In the response selection stage, people attempt to map their
judgments onto response categories provided by the questions. At
this stage, one of the most important method biases is likely to be
commonalities in the scale anchors and formats (Tourangeau et al.,
2000). For example, some people may be hesitant to say “never”
or “always” and therefore select a response option that is less
extreme when confronted with a scale anchored with endpoints of
“always” and/or “never.” When the predictor and criterion variables both share these endpoints, this pattern of responding may
artificially enhance the correlation between them. Another method
bias operating at this stage occurs when preceding questions influence how respondents use the response scales provided to them.
Previous research (cf. Sudman et al., 1996) suggests that when
multiple judgments are made by a respondent using the same scale,
respondents use their initial ratings to anchor the scale and thereby
influence the scaling of their subsequent judgments. In this way,
answers to a question may be influenced by the items preceding it
on the questionnaire, thus influencing the covariation between the
items.
The final stage in the response process involves the editing of
the responses for consistency, acceptability, or other criteria. Many
of the method biases identified in the literature are involved at this
stage. For example, social desirability biases result from the tendency of some people to respond in a socially acceptable manner,
even if their true feelings are different from their responses.
Consistency biases often reflect the propensity for respondents to
try to appear consistent or rational in their responses to questions.
Leniency biases reflect the propensity for respondents to rate those
that they know well higher than they should. Finally, acquiescence
(yea-saying or nay-saying) biases reflect the propensity for respondents to agree (or disagree) with questionnaire items independent
of their content. All of these are examples of how people edit their
responses prior to reporting them.

Techniques for Controlling Common Method Biases
The previous section identified how different method biases
influence the response process. This knowledge can be used to
develop procedures to control their effects. Therefore, in this
section, we discuss the various ways to control for common
method variance and some of the advantages and disadvantages
with each of these techniques. Generally speaking, the two primary
ways to control for method biases are through (a) the design of the
study’s procedures and/or (b) statistical controls.

887

Procedural Remedies
The key to controlling method variance through procedural
remedies is to identify what the measures of the predictor and
criterion variables have in common and eliminate or minimize it
through the design of the study. The connection between the
predictor and criterion variable may come from (a) the respondent,
(b) contextual cues present in the measurement environment or
within the questionnaire itself, and/or (c) the specific wording and
format of the questions.
Obtain measures of the predictor and criterion variables from
different sources. Because one of the major causes of common
method variance is obtaining the measures of both predictor and
criterion variables from the same rater or source, one way of
controlling for it is to collect the measures of these variables from
different sources. For example, those researchers interested in the
effects of leader behaviors on employee performance can obtain
the measures of leader behavior from the subordinates and the
measures of the subordinate’s performance from the leader. Similarly, those researchers interested in research on the relationship
between organizational culture and organizational performance
can obtain the cultural measures from key informants and the
measures of organizational performance from archival sources.
The advantage of this procedure is that it makes it impossible for
the mind set of the source or rater to bias the observed relationship
between the predictor and criterion variable, thus eliminating the
effects of consistency motifs, implicit theories, social desirability
tendencies, dispositional and transient mood states, and any tendencies on the part of the rater to acquiesce or respond in a lenient
manner.
Despite the obvious advantages of this approach, it is not feasible to use in all cases. For example, researchers examining the
relationships between two or more employee job attitudes cannot
obtain measures of these constructs from alternative sources. Similarly, it may not be possible to obtain archival data or to obtain
archival data that adequately represent one of the constructs of
interest. Another problem is that because the data come from
different sources, it must be linked together. This requires an
identifying variable (e.g., such as the supervisor’s and subordinate’s names) that could compromise the anonymity of the respondents and reduce their willingness to participate or change the
nature of their responses. In addition, it can also result in the loss
of information when data on both the predictor and criterion
variables are not obtained. Another disadvantage is that the use of
this remedy may require considerably more time, effort, and/or
cost on the part of the researcher.
Temporal, proximal, psychological, or methodological separation of measurement. When it is not possible to obtain data from
different sources, another potential remedy is to separate the measurement of the predictor and criterion variables. This might be
particularly important in the study of attitude–attitude relationships. This separation of measurement can be accomplished in
several ways. One is to create a temporal separation by introducing
a time lag between the measurement of the predictor and criterion
variables. Another is to create a psychological separation by using
a cover story to make it appear that the measurement of the
predictor variable is not connected with or related to the measurement of the criterion variable. Still another technique is to proximally or methodologically separate the measures by having re-

<-----Page 9----->888

PODSAKOFF, MACKENZIE, LEE, AND PODSAKOFF

spondents complete the measurement of the predictor variable
under conditions or circumstances that are different from the ones
under which they complete the measurement of the criterion variable. For example, researchers can use different response formats
(semantic differential, Likert scales, faces scales, open-ended
questions), media (computer based vs. paper and pencil vs. faceto-face interviews), and/or locations (e.g., different rooms or sites)
for the measurement of the predictor and criterion variables.
With respect to the response processes discussed earlier, the
introduction of a temporal, proximal, or psychological separation
between the measurement of the predictor and criterion variables
has several beneficial effects. First, it should reduce biases in the
retrieval stage of the response process by eliminating the saliency
of any contextually provided retrieval cues. Second, it should
reduce the respondent’s ability and/or motivation to use previous
answers to fill in gaps in what is recalled and/or to infer missing
details. The temporal separation does this by allowing previously
recalled information to leave short-term memory, whereas the
locational separation does this by eliminating common retrieval
cues and the psychological separation does this by reducing the
perceived relevance of the previously recalled information in
short-term memory. Third, creating a temporal, proximal, or psychological separation should reduce biases in the response reporting or editing stage of the response process by making prior
responses less salient, available, or relevant. This diminishes the
respondent’s ability and motivation to use his or her prior responses to answer subsequent questions, thus reducing consistency
motifs and demand characteristics.
There are, of course, some disadvantages to separating the
measurement of the predictor and criterion variables. One is that
the separation of the measurement of these variables potentially
allows contaminating factors to intervene between the measurement of the predictor and criterion variables. For example, although time lags may help reduce common method biases because
they reduce the salience of the predictor variable or its accessibility
in memory, if the lag is inordinately long for the theoretical
relationship under examination, then it could mask a relationship
that really exists. Therefore, the length of the time lag must be
carefully calibrated to correspond to the process under examination. In addition, if the time lag is long, then respondent attrition
may also become a problem. Similarly, a disadvantage of using a
psychological separation to reduce common method biases is that
they can permit the intrusion of potentially contaminating factors.
Finally, a joint disadvantage of all of these methods of introducing
a separation between the measurement of the predictor and criterion variables is that they generally take more time, effort, and
expense to implement. Thus, although there are some distinct
advantages to introducing a separation in measurement, the use of
this technique is not without costs.
Protecting respondent anonymity and reducing evaluation apprehension. There are several additional procedures that can be
used to reduce method biases, especially at the response editing or
reporting stage. One is to allow the respondents’ answers to be
anonymous. Another is to assure respondents that there are no right
or wrong answers and that they should answer questions as honestly as possible. These procedures should reduce people’s evaluation apprehension and make them less likely to edit their responses to be more socially desirable, lenient, acquiescent, and
consistent with how they think the researcher wants them to

respond. Obviously, the primary disadvantage of response anonymity is that it cannot easily be used in conjunction with the two
previously described procedural remedies. That is, if the researcher
separates the source or the measurement context of the predictor
and criterion variables, he or she must have some method of
linking the data together. This compromises anonymity, unless a
linking variable that is not related to the respondent’s identity is
used.
Counterbalancing question order. Another remedy that researchers might use to control for priming effects, item-contextinduced mood states, and other biases related to the question
context or item embeddedness is to counterbalance the order of the
measurement of the predictor and criterion variables.
In principle, this could have the effect of neutralizing some of
the method biases that affect the retrieval stage by controlling the
retrieval cues prompted by the question context. However, the
primary disadvantage of counterbalancing is that it may disrupt the
logical flow and make it impossible to use the funneling procedure
(progressing logically from general to specific questions) often
recommended in the survey research literature (Peterson, 2000).
Improving scale items. Moving beyond issues of the source
and context of measurement, it is also possible to reduce method
biases through the careful construction of the items themselves.
For example, Tourangeau et al. (2000) noted that one of the most
common problems in the comprehension stage of the response
process is item ambiguity and cautioned researchers to (a) define
ambiguous or unfamiliar terms; (b) avoid vague concepts and
provide examples when such concepts must be used; (c) keep
questions simple, specific, and concise; (d) avoid double-barreled
questions; (e) decompose questions relating to more than one
possibility into simpler, more focused questions; and (f) avoid
complicated syntax. Another way to improve scale items is to
eliminate item social desirability and demand characteristics. This
can be done by using ratings of the social desirability or demand
characteristics of each question to identify items that need to be
eliminated or reworded (cf. Nederhof, 1985). Still another way to
diminish method biases is to use different scale endpoints and
formats for the predictor and criterion measures. This reduces
method biases caused by commonalities in scale endpoints and
anchoring effects. Finally, research (cf. Tourangeau et al., 2000)
suggests that acquiescence bias can be reduced by avoiding the use
of bipolar numerical scale values (e.g., –3 to ⫹3) and providing
verbal labels for the midpoints of scales.
Although we can think of no disadvantages of reducing item
ambiguity, social desirability, and demand characteristics, it may
not always be desirable to vary the scale anchors and formats and
to avoid the use of bipolar scale values. For example, altering scale
anchors can change the meaning of a construct and potentially
compromise its validity, and the use of unipolar scale values for
constructs that are naturally bipolar in nature may not be conceptually appropriate. Therefore, we would caution researchers to be
careful not to sacrifice scale validity for the sake of reducing
common method biases when altering the scale formats, anchors,
and scale values.

Statistical Remedies
It is possible that researchers using procedural remedies can
minimize, if not totally eliminate, the potential effects of common

<-----Page 10----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

method variance on the findings of their research. However, in
other cases, they may have difficulty finding a procedural remedy
that meets all of their needs. In these situations, they may find it
useful to use one of the statistical remedies that are available. The
statistical remedies that have been used in the research literature to
control for common method biases are summarized in Table 4 and
are discussed in the section that follows.
Harman’s single-factor test. One of the most widely used
techniques that has been used by researchers to address the issue of
common method variance is what has come to be called Harman’s
one-factor (or single-factor) test. Traditionally, researchers using
this technique load all of the variables in their study into an
exploratory factor analysis (cf. Andersson & Bateman, 1997;
Aulakh & Gencturk, 2000; Greene & Organ, 1973; Organ &
Greene, 1981; Schriesheim, 1979) and examine the unrotated
factor solution to determine the number of factors that are necessary to account for the variance in the variables. The basic assumption of this technique is that if a substantial amount of
common method variance is present, either (a) a single factor will
emerge from the factor analysis or (b) one general factor will
account for the majority of the covariance among the measures.
More recently, some researchers using this technique (cf. Iverson
& Maguire, 2000; Korsgaard & Roberson, 1995; Mossholder,
Bennett, Kemery, & Wesolowski, 1998) have used confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) as a more sophisticated test of the hypothesis
that a single factor can account for all of the variance in their data.
Despite its apparent appeal, there are several limitations of this
procedure. First, and most importantly, although the use of a
single-factor test may provide an indication of whether a single
factor accounts for all of the covariances among the items, this
procedure actually does nothing to statistically control for (or
partial out) method effects. If anything, it is a diagnostic technique
for assessing the extent to which common method variance may be
a problem. However, even on this count, it is an insensitive test. If
only one factor emerges from the factor analysis and this factor
accounts for all of the variance in the items, it might be reasonable
to conclude that common method variance is a major problem
(although one could also conclude that the measures of the constructs lacked discriminant validity, were correlated because of a
causal relationship, or both). However, in our experience, it is
unlikely that a one-factor model will fit the data. It is much more
likely that multiple factors will emerge from the factor analysis,
and, contrary to what some have said, this is not evidence that the
measures are free of common method variance. Indeed, if it were,
then it would mean that common method variance would have to
completely account for the covariances among the items for it to be
regarded as a problem in a particular study. Clearly, this assumption is unwarranted. Therefore, despite the fact this procedure is
widely used, we do not believe it is a useful remedy to deal with
the problem and turn our attention to other statistical remedies that
we feel are better suited for this purpose.
Partial correlation procedures designed to control for method
biases. One statistical procedure that has been used to try to
control the effects of method variance is the partial correlation
procedure. As indicated in Table 4, there are several different
variations of this procedure, including (a) partialling out social
desirability or general affectivity, (b) partialling out a “marker”
variable, and (c) partialling out a general factor score. All of these
techniques are similar in that they use a measure of the assumed

889

source of the method variance as a covariate in the statistical
analysis. However, they differ in the terms of the specific nature of
the source and the extent to which the source can be directly
measured. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these
techniques is discussed in the paragraphs that follow.
As noted earlier, two variables frequently assumed to cause
common method variance are the respondents’ affective states and
the tendency to respond in a socially desirable manner. In view of
this, some researchers (cf. Brief et al., 1988; Burke et al., 1993;
Chen & Spector, 1991; Jex & Spector, 1996) have attempted to
control for these biases by measuring these variables directly and
then partialling their effects out of the predictor and criterion
variables. The advantage of this procedure is that it is relatively
easy and straightforward to use, in that it only requires that the
researcher obtain a measure of the presumed cause of the method
biases (e.g., social desirability, negative affectivity) and compare
the differences in the partial correlation between the predictor and
criterion variables with their zero-order correlation using Olkin
and Finn’s (1995) significance test (cf. Spector, Chen, &
O’Connell, 2000).
However, despite the advantages, there are some limitations of
this procedure as well. As noted by Williams, Gavin, and Williams
(1996, p. 89), the first limitation of this technique is that the
procedure
does not distinguish between the measures of a construct and the
construct itself. As such, the analysis does not incorporate a model of
the measurement process. Consequently, it is not possible to assess
whether [the directly measured variable] is acting as a measurement
contaminant or whether it has a substantive relationship with the
[constructs] of interest . . . . Thus, the shared variance attributable to
[the directly measured variable] in some past research . . . may reflect
some combination of measurement and substantive issues.

Generally speaking, the techniques used to control for common
method variance should reflect the fact that it is expected to have
its effects at the item level rather than at the construct level.
However, for certain types of biases (e.g., social desirability,
negative affectivity), it may make theoretical sense to also model
the effects of method variance at the construct level (cf. Brief et al.,
1988; Williams et al., 1996). Thus, a limitation of this technique is
that it prevents a researcher from examining the relative impact of
these two distinct types of effects.
Williams et al. (1996) have noted that another limitation of this
procedure is that it assumes that the variance shared between the
predictor variable of interest, the dependent variable of interest,
and the common method variable included in the study is not also
shared with some other variables. For example, if the variance
shared among the independent variable of interest, the criterion
variable of interest, and the common method variable is also
shared with other variables included in the study, then the differences between the zero-order relationships and the partialled relationships that are attributed to the common method variable may
actually be the result of the other variables that are correlated with
them. However, it is important to recognize that the possible
impact of “third variables” is a limitation that applies to every
method of controlling common method variance and indeed to
virtually every modeling technique.
Finally, it is also important to note that this procedure only
controls for that portion of common method variance that is

Partialling out social desirability or

Measures of social desirability (or
positive or negative affectivity)
are used as surrogates of
common methods variance, and
the structural parameters are
examined both with and
without these measures to
determine their potential effects
on the observed relationships.

Partialling out social desirability or affectivity as a
surrogate for method variance
Assumes that all of the common methods variance
is attributable to the specific surrogate being
measured (e.g., social desirability, negative
affectivity, positive affectivity). However, these
surrogates may not adequately tap the whole
common methods variance domain.
There is no statistical test to determine differential fit
of the model with and without social desirability.
Does not permit the researcher to determine whether
social desirability serves as a confounding variable
at the measurement level or has a substantive effect
on the relationships examined.
Ignores measurement error.

Partialling out an unrelated “marker
variable” as a surrogate for
method variance
A “marker variable” that is
theoretically unrelated to the
constructs of interest is
included in the study, and the
structural parameters are
examined both with and
without this measure to
determine its potential effects
on the observed relationships.

Partialling out an unrelated “marker variable” as a
surrogate for method variance
Fails to control for some of the most powerful
causes of common method biases (e.g., implicit
theories, consistency motif, social desirability).
Assumes that common method biases have the
same effect on all observed variables.
Assumes common method variance can only inflate
not deflate, the observed relationship between
predictor and criterion variable.
Ignores measurement error.

Partialling out a general methods
factor
After the first unrotated (general)
factor is identified using factor
analysis, its effects are
partialled out to determine
whether the structural
relationships between the
variables of interest are still
significant.

Partialling out a general methods factor
Although the assumption is that the general factor
that is partialled out is composed of common
methods, we may also be partialling out some
actual covariance between the constructs of interest.
Partialling out methods variance in this fashion may
produce biased parameter estimates.
There is no statistical test to determine differential fit
of the model with and without the general factor.
Conclusions based on this procedure are sensitive to
the number of variables included in the analysis.

attributable to the specific surrogate being measured (e.g., social
desirability, positive or negative affectivity). However, given the
wide variety of possible causes of method variance discussed in
our article, this technique cannot be regarded as a complete solution to the problem.
Another partial correlation technique that has been recently
recommended is the use of a marker variable to control for common method biases (Lindell & Brandt, 2000; Lindell & Whitney,
2001). Lindell and his colleagues have argued that if a variable can
be identified on theoretical grounds that should not be related to at
least one other variable included in the study, then it can be used
as a marker in that any observed relationships between it and any
of the other variables can be assumed to be due to common method
variance. Moreover, they conclude that partialling out the average
correlation between the marker variable and the other variables
included in the study should allow the researcher to control for the
possible contaminating effect of method biases.
The principal advantage of this procedure is its ease of implementation, especially if one uses the smallest observed correlation
among the manifest variables as a proxy for common method
variance, like Lindell and Brandt (2000). However, the marker
variable technique to control for common method variance has a
number of conceptual and empirical problems. From a conceptual
point of view, a major problem is that this procedure fails to
control for some of the most powerful causes of common method
biases (e.g., implicit theories, consistency motif, social desirability). Because a marker variable is one that most people believe
should not be related to the predictor or criterion variable, there is
no reason to expect that it provides an estimate of the effect of a
person’s implicit theory about why the predictor and criterion
variables should be related, and therefore partialling out the effects
of the marker variable will not control for these sources of common method variance. For example, few people would argue on
theoretical grounds that an employee’s self-reported shoe size
should be related to either an employee’s performance or the
employee’s ratings of his or her supervisor’s supportive leadership
behavior. Therefore, self-reported shoe size meets all of the criteria
identified by Lindell and Whitney (2001) and would be an excellent marker variable. However, it is hard to imagine how the
strength of the relationship between reported shoe size and employee performance could possibly represent an employees’ implicit theory about why supportive leader behavior should be
related to employee performance, and therefore partialling out the
effects of shoe size would not control for this source of common
method variance. The same could be said for the ability of shoe
size to serve as a marker variable to control for consistency motif
and/or social desirability.
A final conceptual problem with this technique is that it assumes
that the common method factor represented by the marker variable
“has exactly the same impact on all of the observed variables”
(Lindell & Whitney, 2001, p. 116). Although we tend to agree with
Lindell and Whitney (2001) that this might be a reasonable assumption for some sources of common method variance (e.g.,
common scale format, common anchors, or leniency biases), there
is no reason why this should necessarily be true for other types of
method biases. For example, there is no reason to assume that
implicit theories would affect the relationships between all pairs of
measures in the same way. In any case, because some of the other
methods that control for common method variance do not have to

893

make this tenuous assumption, this should be regarded as a relative
disadvantage of this approach.
In addition to these conceptual problems, there are also three
important empirical problems with the use of the marker variable
technique. First, the procedure is based on the assumption that
common method variance can only inflate, not deflate, the observed relationship between a predictor and criterion variable (see
Lindell & Whitney, 2001, p. 115). However, as noted earlier,
common method variance can inflate, deflate, or have no effect on
the observed relationships between predictors and criterion variables (cf. Cote & Buckley, 1988). Second, the procedure ignores
measurement error. Third, it assumes that common method factors
do not interact with traits—a point that has been disputed by
Campbell and O’Connell (1967, 1982), Bagozzi and Yi (1990),
and Wothke and Browne (1990), among others.
The last of the partial correlation procedures used in previous
research is the general factor covariate technique (Bemmels, 1994;
Dooley & Fryxell, 1999; Organ & Greene, 1981; Parkhe, 1993;
Podsakoff & Todor, 1985). In this procedure, the first step is to
conduct an exploratory factor analysis of the variables included in
the study. Then, a scale score for the first unrotated factor (which
is assumed to contain the best approximation of common method
variance) is calculated and partialled out of the relationship between the predictor and criterion variable. This procedure shares
some of the same advantages and disadvantages as the other two
partial correlation procedures. The principal advantage is that it is
relatively easy to use because the researcher does not have to identify
the specific source of the common method variance. However, like
some of the partial correlation procedures, it ignores measurement
error. In addition, another important disadvantage is that this general
method factor may reflect not only common method variance among
the measures of the constructs but also variance due to true causal
relationships between the constructs. Indeed, it is impossible to separate these two sources of variation using this technique. Consequently, covarying out the effects of this general factor score may
produce biased parameter estimates of the relationship between the
constructs of interest (cf. Kemery & Dunlap, 1986).
Controlling for the effects of a directly measured latent methods
factor. Up to this point, none of the statistical methods discussed
are able to adequately account for measurement error or distinguish between the effects of a method factor on the measures of the
construct and the construct itself. To address these issues, researchers have turned to the use of latent variable models. One
approach that has been used involves directly measuring the presumed cause of the method bias (e.g., social desirability, negative
affectivity, or positive affectivity), modeling it as a latent construct, and allowing the indicators of the constructs of interest to
load on this factor as well as their hypothesized constructs (see
figure with social desirability as the latent methods factor in Table
4). For example, Williams has used this approach to examine the
potentially biasing effects of negative affectivity on the relationships between a variety of job attitudes and role perceptions
(Williams et al., 1996) and the effects of positive and negative
emotionality (Williams & Anderson, 1994). The advantages of
using this approach are that it (a) allows measurement error in the
method factor to be estimated, (b) models the effects of the biasing
factor on the measures themselves rather than directly on the theoretical constructs of interest, and (c) does not constrain the effects of
the methods factor on the individual measures to be equal.

<-----Page 15----->894

PODSAKOFF, MACKENZIE, LEE, AND PODSAKOFF

However, there are disadvantages to this approach as well. To
use this method, the researcher must know what the most important sources of method biases are in his or her study and be able to
directly measure them. This is a serious limitation because it is
often difficult to identify the most important sources of method
bias in a given situation. In addition, valid measures for some of
the sources of bias that a researcher might identify simply do not
exist (e.g., implicit theories, consistency biases, common scale
format and anchors). Finally, this technique requires the assumption that the method factor does not interact with the constructs of
interest. As previously noted, this assumption has been questioned
by Campbell and O’Connell (1967), Bagozzi and Yi (1990), and
Wothke and Browne (1990).
Controlling for the effects of a single unmeasured latent method
factor. Another latent variable approach that has been used involves adding a first-order factor with all of the measures as
indicators to the researcher’s theoretical model. Such a model is
depicted in Table 4 and has been used in a number of studies (e.g.,
Carlson & Kacmar, 2000; Carlson & Perrewe, 1999; Conger,
Kanungo, & Menon, 2000; Elangovan & Xie, 1999; Facteau,
Dobbins, Russell, Ladd, & Kudisch, 1995; MacKenzie, Podsakoff,
& Fetter, 1991, 1993; MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Paine, 1999;
Moorman & Blakely, 1995; Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1994; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990). One of the main
advantages of this technique is that it does not require the researcher to identify and measure the specific factor responsible for
the method effects. In addition, this technique models the effect of
the method factor on the measures rather than on the latent constructs they represent and does not require the effects of the
method factor on each measure to be equal.
Like the other methods discussed, there are also some disadvantages of this approach. One is that although this technique
controls for any systematic variance among the items that is
independent of the covariance due to the constructs of interest, it
does not permit the researcher to identify the specific cause of the
method bias. Indeed, the factor may reflect not only different types
of common method variance but also variance due to relationships
between the constructs other than the one hypothesized. Another
disadvantage is that if the number of indicators of the constructs is
small relative to the number of constructs of interest, the addition
of the method factor can cause the model to be underidentified. As
a solution to this problem, some researchers have constrained the
measurement factor loadings to be equal. Although this solves the
identification problem, it also undermines one of the advantages of
this technique. A final disadvantage is that this technique assumes
that the method factor does not interact with trait factors. Thus, this
approach does have some limitations even though it is attractive
because it does not require the researcher to identify the potential
source of the method variance in advance.
Use of multiple-method factors to control method variance. A
variation of the common method factor technique has been frequently used in the literature (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1990; Cote &
Buckley, 1987; Williams et al., 1989). This model differs from the
common method factor model previously described in two ways.
First, multiple first-order method factors are added to the model.
Second, each of these method factors is hypothesized to influence
only a subset of the measures rather than all of them. The most
common example of this type of model is the multitrait–
multimethod (MTMM) model (Campbell & Fiske, 1959), where

measures of multiple traits using multiple methods are obtained. In
this way, the variance of the responses to a specific measure can be
partitioned into trait, method, and random error components, thus
permitting the researcher to control for both method variance and
random error when looking at relationships between the predictor
and criterion variables. The first advantage of this technique is that
it allows the researcher to examine the effects of several methods
factors at one time. A second advantage is that this technique
permits the researcher to examine the effects of specifically hypothesized method biases by constraining some of the paths from
the method factors to measures that they are not hypothesized to
influence to be equal to zero. A third advantage of this technique
is that it does not require the direct measurement of these hypothesized method biases.
Despite these advantages, the principal disadvantages of this
technique are (a) potentially severe problems may be encountered
when estimating these models because of identification problems,
specification errors, and sampling errors (Spector & Brannick,
1995); (b) it assumes that the method factors do not interact with
the predictor and criterion constructs; and (c) it requires the researcher to identify the potential sources of method bias to specify
the relationships between the method factors and the measures.
Correlated uniqueness model. One technique that has been
recommended to address the estimation problems encountered
with the use of the MTMM model is the correlated uniqueness
model (Kenny, 1979; Marsh, 1989; Marsh & Bailey, 1991). In an
MTMM model, each observed variable is modeled as being caused
by one trait factor, one method factor, and one measurement error
term. However, in a correlated uniqueness model, each observed
variable is caused by only a trait factor and a measurement error
term. There are no method factors. Instead, the correlated uniqueness model accounts for method effects by allowing the error terms
of variables measured by the same method to be correlated. Thus,
like the MTMM model, this technique requires the researcher to be
able to identify the sources of method variance so that the appropriate pattern of measurement error correlations can be estimated.
The principal advantage of the correlated uniqueness approach
is that it is more likely than the MTMM model to converge and to
produce proper parameter estimates (cf. Becker & Cote, 1994;
Conway, 1998; Marsh, 1989; Marsh & Bailey, 1991). In addition,
like the CFA technique, the correlated uniqueness technique (a)
allows the researcher to examine the effects of multiple method
biases at one time, (b) permits the researcher to examine the effects
of specifically hypothesized method biases, and (c) does not require the direct measurement of these hypothesized method biases.
Historically, its principal disadvantage was its inability to estimate
the proportion of variance in a measure caused by method effects,
although recent developments by Conway (1998) and Scullen
(1999) have demonstrated how this can be done by averaging the
measurement error correlations. However, other serious disadvantages remain. As noted by Lance, Noble, and Scullen (2002), these
include the fact that (a) method effects are constrained to be
orthogonal under the correlated uniqueness model; (b) the estimates of the trait variance components are likely to be biased
because the error terms in this model are an aggregation of systematic, nonsystematic, and method effects; (c) this model assumes that the various method biases are uncorrelated; and (d) this
method assumes that trait and method effects do not interact.

<-----Page 16----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

Direct product model. A common criticism of all of the statistical remedies involving latent constructs that have been discussed so far is that they require the assumption that the method
factors do not interact with the predictor and criterion constructs
(i.e., trait factors). According to Campbell and O’Connell (1967,
1982), this is a tenuous assumption because there are circumstances in which trait and method factors are likely to interact
multiplicatively such that method biases augment (or attenuate) the
correlation between strongly related constructs more than they
augment (or attenuate) the correlations between weakly related
constructs. The direct product model (Bagozzi & Yi, 1990; Bechger, 1998; Browne, 1984; Wothke & Browne, 1990) was developed to take Trait ⫻ Method interactions like these into account,
and it does this through a radically different underlying model
structure that replaces the additive paths in a traditional MTMM
CFA with relationships that reflect multiplicative interactions between traits and methods. To the extent that Trait ⫻ Method
interactions are present, this is obviously a major advantage. In
addition, like the correlated uniqueness model, the direct product
model is more likely than the MTMM model to converge and
produce proper solutions.
However, these advantages are undermined by some fairly serious disadvantages. One major disadvantage is that the direct
product model cannot provide separate estimates of the amount of
trait and method variance present in a measure, thus making it
difficult to assess item validity by examining how well each
measure reflects the trait it is intended to represent. A second
disadvantage is that the direct product model does not control for
the main effects of the trait and method factors when testing the
Trait ⫻ Method interactions, as is standard procedure when testing
interactions. Third, although this technique tests for method biases,
it cannot be used to statistically control for them while simultaneously estimating the relationship between a predictor and criterion construct. Still other disadvantages include that it (a) does not
permit researchers to identify the specific cause of any method
biases observed and (b) requires the specification of a complex
set of equality constraints when estimated using the most
widely available structural equation modeling programs (e.g.,
LISREL, EQS, AMOS). However, in our view, perhaps the
most serious disadvantage is that Trait ⫻ Method interactions
may not be very common or potent. Indeed, the weight of the
evidence (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1990, 1991; Bagozzi et al., 1991;
Becker & Cote, 1994; Hernandez & Gonzalez-Roma, 2002;
Kumar & Dillon, 1992) suggests that although Trait ⫻ Method
interactions are theoretically possible and do exist in certain
circumstances, they are not usually very strong and a simpler
MTMM model may be just as good as the more complicated
direct product approach.

Comparison of Statistical Remedies for Common Method
Biases
The preceding section provides a review of the statistical procedures that have been used in the literature to control for common
method biases. However, there are some potential remedies that
have not been tried, which, when combined with the methods that
have been used, suggest a continuum of ways to statistically
control for common method biases. Table 5 summarizes this set of
potential remedies and highlights some of their key features. As

895

shown in Table 5, some of the statistical approaches require the
researcher to identify the source of method bias and require a valid
measure of the biasing factor whereas others do not. In addition,
the approaches differ in the extent to which they control a variety
of potential problems, including (a) the ability to distinguish
method bias at the measurement level from method bias at the
construct level, (b) measurement error, (c) single versus multiple
sources of method bias, and (d) Trait ⫻ Method interactions.
Generally speaking, as one moves from left to right and from top
to bottom in the table, the approaches require more effort on the
part of the researcher, either because the model specification is
more complex or because additional measures of the method bias
must be obtained.
The approaches shown in the second column of the table (partial
correlation approaches) have the advantage that they are relatively
easy to implement and can be used even with small sample sizes
(i.e., samples too small to meet the requirements for latent variable
structural equation modeling). However, they are the weakest
among the statistical remedies because they (a) fail to distinguish
method bias at the measurement level from method bias at the
construct level, (b) ignore measurement error in the method factor,
(c) only control for a single source of method bias at a time, and
(d) ignore Method ⫻ Trait interactions. Thus, although fairly easy
to implement and widely used, they are not very satisfactory
methods for controlling for method biases.
The second set of approaches (single-method-scale-score approaches) are an improvement over the first group of techniques
because they distinguish method bias at the measurement level
from method bias at the construct level and appropriately model it
at the measurement level. To our knowledge, no one has used this
set of procedures to control for method variance, probably because
these techniques still ignore measurement error in the method
factor, even though there is no reason to do so. One situation in
which the technique identified in Cell 2B might be useful is where
the measure of the potential biasing factor (e.g., social desirability)
has a large number of items (e.g., 10 or more) and/or a complex
factor structure. In this instance, the researcher may decide to use
a scale score to represent the source of bias because if the measures
are all treated as separate indictors of the biasing factor, then any
nonhypothesized measurement error covariances will contribute to
the lack of fit of the model. If these measurement error covariances
are substantial, then the goodness-of-fit of the model will be
disproportionately influenced by them. However, even in this case,
we believe that a better remedy to this problem would be to create
a small number of testlets (Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994) composed of random subsets of the measures of the biasing factor and
then use the procedure in Cell 3B.
The third set of approaches (single-method-factor approaches)
have the advantages of estimating method biases at the measurement level and controlling measurement error. Perhaps because of
these advantages, these techniques have been frequently used in
the literature. Examples of the use of the single-common-methodfactor approach shown in Cell 3A include Carlson and Kacmar
(2000), Elangovan and Xie (1999), MacKenzie et al. (1991, 1993),
and Podsakoff et al. (1990) and examples of the use of the
single-specific-method-factor approach shown in Cell 3B include
Williams and Anderson (1994) and Williams et al. (1996). The
main disadvantages of these approaches are that they only control
for a single source of method bias at a time and assume that

Method ⫻ Trait interactions are not present. How serious these
disadvantages are depends on how confident the researcher is that
the method factor adequately captures the main source of method
bias and that Method ⫻ Trait interactions do not exist. The former
is a judgment that has to be made primarily on conceptual grounds.
However, on the latter issue, the empirical evidence suggests that
Method ⫻ Trait interactions are unlikely to be very strong (Becker
& Cote, 1994).
The final set of approaches shown in Table 5 (multiple-methodfactor approaches) is the strongest of the approaches depicted. Cell
4A represents the classic MTMM model, whereas 4B represents a
situation in which the researcher has directly measured several
suspected sources of method bias (e.g., social desirability, positive
affectivity and negative affectivity), models these biasing factors
as latent variables with multiple indicators, and estimates their
effects on the measures of the constructs of interest. These approaches are particularly strong because they model method bias at
the measurement level, control for measurement error, and incorporate multiple sources of method bias. However, they have two
key disadvantages. The first is that because the models are complex, estimation problems may be encountered. It is widely recognized that this is especially a problem for the MTMM model
shown in Cell 4A (cf. Becker & Cote, 1994; Brannick & Spector,
1990; Marsh, 1989; Marsh & Bailey, 1991; Spector & Brannick,
1995). It is for this reason that some researchers (Conway, 1998;
Kenny, 1979; Marsh, 1989; Marsh & Bailey, 1991; Scullen, 1999)
have recommended the use of the correlated uniqueness model.
However, because the MTMM model is conceptually and empirically superior to the correlated uniqueness model as long as it is
not empirically underidentified (cf. Lance, Noble, & Scullen,
2002), the correlated uniqueness model is not shown in the summary table. The second problem encountered by all of the approaches in the final column of Table 5 is that they do not take
Method ⫻ Trait interactions into account.
Although not shown in Table 5, one approach that takes
Method ⫻ Trait interactions into account is the direct product
model. Unlike the other approaches, it (a) distinguishes method
bias at the measurement level from method bias at the construct
level, (b) takes measurement error in the method factor into account, (c) can control for multiple sources of method bias at the
same time, and (d) captures Method ⫻ Trait interactions. However, at the present time, this approach is not recommended for two
reasons. First, the conceptual nature of Trait ⫻ Method interactions has never been well articulated, thus making it difficult to
predict when these interactions are likely to occur. Second, the
existing empirical evidence suggests that these interactions may be
fairly rare in research settings, and even when they do occur, they
are generally weak and a simpler MTMM model may be just as
good in these situations as the more complicated direct product
approach (cf. Bagozzi & Yi, 1991; Becker & Cote, 1994). Therefore, additional research is needed on these issues before the use of
the direct product model is likely to be widely recommended as a
technique for controlling common method biases.

Recommendations for Controlling Method Biases in
Research Settings
Our discussion in this article clearly indicates that common
method variance can have a substantial impact on the observed

897

relationships between predictor and criterion variables in organizational and behavioral research. Although estimates of the
strength of the impact of common method biases vary (cf. Bagozzi
& Yi, 1990; Cote & Buckley, 1987; Spector, 1987, 1994; Williams
et al., 1989), their average level is quite substantial. Indeed, the
evidence reported by Cote and Buckley (1987) from 70 MTMM
studies conducted in a variety of disciplines indicates that the
observed relationship between a typical predictor and criterion
variable is understated by approximately 26% because of common
method biases. Moreover, as noted in Table 2, this bias may come
from a number of different sources that could be in operation in
any given research study. Therefore, we believe that researchers
would be wise to do whatever they can to control for method
biases, and the method used to control for it should to be tailored
to match the specific research setting.
Figure 1 describes a set of procedures that might be used to
control for method biases that are designed to match several
typical research settings. Generally speaking, we recommend that
researchers follow good measurement practice by implementing
all of the procedural remedies related to questionnaire and item
design (e.g., eliminate item ambiguity, demand characteristics,
social desirability). Following this, we recommend that they implement additional procedural and statistical remedies to control
for the method biases that are likely to be present in their specific
research situation. This can be done by considering four key
questions: (a) Can the predictor and criterion variables be obtained
from different sources? (b) Can the predictor and criterion variables be measured in different contexts? (c) Can the source of the
method bias be identified? and (d) Can the method bias be validly
measured?
Beginning at the bottom left of Figure 1 (Situation 1), if the
predictor and criterion variables can be measured from different
sources, then we recommend that this be done. Additional statistical remedies could be used but in our view are probably unnecessary in these instances.
Moving to Situation 2 in Figure 1, if the predictor and criterion
variables are obtained from the same source but can be obtained in
a different context, the researcher has a good idea about the
source(s) of the method bias (e.g., social desirability, negative
affectivity, positive affectivity), and the suspected bias can be
validly measured, then we recommend that researchers (a) separate
the measures of the predictor and criterion variables (temporally,
proximally, psychologically, and/or methodologically) and (b)
measure the biasing factor(s) and estimate its effects on the measures using the single-specific-method-factor or multiple-specificmethod-factors approaches (Cells 3B or 4B in Table 5). The
rationale for this recommendation is that separating the measurement of the predictor and criterion variable should help to prevent
method biases because of a common rater, whereas the statistical
remedy controls for these biases if they happen to occur in spite of
this procedural control.
Situation 3 represents virtually the same circumstances as described in Situation 2, with the exception that there is no valid way
to measure the biasing factor suspected to be in operation. In this
instance, we recommend that researchers separate the measures of
the predictor and criterion variables (temporally, proximally, psychologically, and/or methodologically) and estimate any residual
effects of the suspected source of method bias using the singlecommon-method-factor approach specified in Cell 3A in Table 5

<-----Page 19----->898

or the multiple-common-method-factors approach specified in
Cell 4A (depending on the number of biasing factors believed
to be in operation). This situation might arise if leniency biases
are expected to be a potential problem in a study because changing the measurement context does not control for this form of
bias and there is no valid scale to directly measure leniency
biases. Under these circumstances, a method of statistical control
that does not require the biasing factor to be directly measured
must be used (e.g., single-common-method-factor approach).
However, in other situations in which several biasing factors that
are not directly measurable exist, it may be necessary to use the
approach specified in Cell 4A (multiple-common-method-factors
approach).
The recommendations for Situation 4 are the same as Situation 3, with the exception that the multiple-common-methodfactors approach (Cell 4A) cannot be used. This method of statistical control cannot be used in this case because the specification
of a multiple-common-method-factors model requires the sources
of method bias to be known by the researcher; otherwise, it is
impossible to specify which method factor influences which specific measures.

Situations 5–7 differ from Situations 2– 4 in that it is not
possible to measure the predictor and criterion variables in different times or locations. As a result, the procedural remedy of
separating the measurement of the predictor and criterion variables temporally or proximally cannot be used. One potential
procedural remedy in this case is to attempt to reduce method
bias by guaranteeing response anonymity. Another procedural
remedy is to separate the predictor and criterion variable psychologically. As noted earlier, this might be done by creating a cover
story to make it appear that the measurement of the predictor
variable is not connected with or related to the measurement of the
criterion variable. However, because guaranteeing anonymity
and/or psychological separation does not eliminate all of the different method biases associated with a common rater and measurement context (e.g., dispositional moods states, leniency biases,
acquiescence biases, contextually provided retrieval cues), the
researcher needs to depend more on the statistical remedies in
these cases.
Situation 5 is one in which the predictor and criterion variables
cannot be obtained from different sources or contexts, but the
source(s) of the method bias can be identified and a valid scale to

<-----Page 20----->COMMON METHOD BIASES IN BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH

measure it exists. Under these circumstances, we recommend that
researchers try to statistically control for the effect of these bias(es)
using the single-specific-method-factor approach (Cell 3B in Table
5) or the multiple-specific-method-factors approach (Cell 4B in
Table 5).
Situation 6 is similar to Situation 5, except that the method
bias(es) cannot be validly measured. Under these circumstances,
the single-common-method-factor approach (Cell 3A in Table 5)
or the multiple-common-method-factors approach (Cell 4A),
should be used to statistically control for method biases. For
example, if the predictor and criterion measures are obtained from
the same source in the same context and the researcher suspects
that implicit theories may bias the raters’ responses, then the
single-common-method-factor approach should be used. Alternatively, in a study that obtained measures of the predictor and
criterion variables from three different sources (e.g., peers, supervisors, and subordinates) all at the same time, the multiplecommon-method-factors approach should be used.
Finally, Situation 7 displays a circumstance in which a researcher cannot obtain the predictor and criterion variables from
different sources, cannot separate the measurement context, and
cannot identify the source of the method bias. In this situation, it
is best to use a single-common-method-factor approach (Cell 3A
in Table 5) to statistically control for method biases.
Of course, it is important to note that it may be impossible to
completely eliminate all forms of common method biases in a
particular study, and controlling for common method biases becomes more complex in multiple equation systems in which relationships between criterion variables are hypothesized (e.g., mediating effects models). However, the goal should be to reduce the
plausibility of method biases as an explanation of the relationships
observed between the constructs of interest. In most instances, this
involves a combination of the procedural and statistical remedies
previously discussed. In general, we recommend that researchers
first try to prevent method biases from influencing their results by
implementing any of the procedural remedies that make sense
within the context of their research. However, because it may be
impossible to eliminate some sources of bias with procedural
remedies, we recommend that researchers follow this up with
appropriate statistical remedies.
For example, a researcher interested in the potential mediating
effects of employees’ trust in their leaders and commitment to the
organization on the relationships between transformational leadership behaviors and employee performance may find it difficult (or
even undesirable) to obtain all of the measures from different
sources. In this case, even though the researcher might be able to
maintain the independence of the leader behavior and performance
measures by obtaining the ratings of the leader from the subordinates and the ratings of performance from the leader, there is still
the problem of where to obtain the measures of the employee
attitudes (trust and commitment) to maintain their independence.
Of course, one solution to this dilemma would be to obtain
objective measures of employee performance from company
records and then have the supervisor provide the ratings of their
perceptions of the employees’ trust and commitment. However,
given that one’s behavior does not always correlate strongly with
one’s attitudes (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), it is doubtful whether the
supervisors’ (or anyone else’s) perceptions of employees’ attitudes
is as good a measure as the employees’ own self-reports. Another

899

possible procedural remedy is to have the supervisors provide
self-reports of their own transformational leadership behavior and
the subordinates provide ratings of their own attitudes. Unfortunately, given the evidence that self-reports of behavior are often
considerably different from the reports of others (cf. Harris &
Schaubroeck, 1988; Jones & Nisbett, 1972), this remedy has other
limitations that are associated with it.
Therefore, in the situation described above, the best course of
action would probably be to obtain the measures of employee
performance from company records; to obtain the measures of the
leader behaviors and employee attitudes from the employees but to
separate their measurement temporally, contextually, or psychologically; and to statistically control for same-source biases in the
leader behavior and employee attitude measures by adding a
single-common-method-factor to the structural equation model
used to test the hypothesized relationships. However, the key point
to remember is that the procedural and statistical remedies selected
should be tailored to fit the specific research question at hand.
There is no single best method for handling the problem of
common method variance because it depends on what the sources
of method variance are in the study and the feasibility of the
remedies that are available.

Some Additional Considerations
Our discussion of common method variance up to this point has
focused on fairly typical situations in which the measures of a
predictor and criterion variable are obtained in a field setting using
some form of questionnaire. However, there are two other situations that generally have not been discussed in the method variance
literature that also deserve our attention. The first of these is in
experimental research settings in which mediating processes are
examined and the measures of the potential mediators and/or
dependent variables are obtained from the same source. The second area relates to the special problems encountered in trying to
statistically control for method biases when using formative indicator measurement models (cf. Bollen & Lennox, 1991). In this
section, we discuss each of these issues in turn.

Controlling for Method Variance in Experimental
Research Examining Mediated Effects
It is often assumed that experimental studies are immune to the
method biases discussed in this article because measures of the
independent and dependent variable are not obtained from the
same person at the same point in time. However, it is not uncommon in experimental studies for researchers to manipulate an
independent variable and obtain measures of a potential mediator
as well as the dependent variable. The problem with this is that
these two measures are usually obtained from the same subjects at
the same point in time. In such cases, method biases contribute to
the observed relationship between the mediator and the dependent
measure. One possible remedy for this is to control for methods
effects using the single-common-method-factor approach discussed in Cell 3A of Table 5. As in the case of field research,
experimental studies that can demonstrate that the relationships
observed between the variables of interest are significant after
controlling for method biases provide more compelling evidence
than those that do not.

PODSAKOFF, MACKENZIE, LEE, AND PODSAKOFF

Controlling for Method Variance in Studies Using
Formative Constructs
For most of the constructs measured in behavioral research, the
relationship between the measures and constructs is implicitly
based on classical test theory that assumes that the variation in the
scores on measures of a construct is a function of the true score
plus error. Thus, the underlying latent construct is assumed to
cause the observed variation in the measures (Bollen, 1989; Nunnally, 1978), and the indicators are said to be reflective of the
underlying construct. This assumed direction of causality—from
the latent variable to its measures—is conceptually appropriate in
many instances but not all. Indeed, it has been recognized now for
several decades that, for some constructs, it makes more sense
conceptually to view causality flowing from the measures to the
construct rather than vice versa (Blalock, 1964; Bollen & Lennox,
1991; MacCallum & Browne, 1993). In these cases, the constructs
are often called composite latent variables and the measures are
said to represent formative indicators of the construct. Researchers
(cf. Bollen & Lennox, 1991; Law & Wong, 1999) are now beginning to recognize that many of the most widely used constructs in
the field (e.g., job satisfaction, role ambiguity, role conflict, task
characteristics) are more accurately represented as formativeindicator constructs than they are as reflective-indicator constructs.
Perhaps of more importance, research by Law and Wong (1999)
has demonstrated that misspecifying measurement relationships by
modeling formative-indicator constructs as if they were reflectiveindicator constructs can have serious biasing effects on estimates
of the relationships between constructs.
Although not previously recognized in the literature, the distinction between formative-indicator and reflective-indicator measurement models is also important because it complicates the
treatment of common method biases. The goal of the statistical
control procedures discussed in Table 5 is to obtain an estimate of
the relationship between the constructs and measures that partials
out the effect of method bias. Unfortunately, if a researcher uses
the methods shown in the table (i.e., models the effects of a method
factor on the formative measures), he or she will not partial the
effect of method bias out of the estimated relationship between the
formative measures and the construct. This is true because the
method factor does not enter into the equation where the relationship between the formative measures and the construct is estimated. Indeed, from a conceptual point of view, the effects of
method bias on formatively measured constructs should be modeled at the construct level rather than the item level. If this is done,
the estimated relationships between the formative measures and
the formative construct will be independent of method bias. This is
consistent with Bollen and Lennox’s (1991) conceptual argument
that for formative constructs, measurement error resides at the
construct rather than the item level. Unfortunately, such a model is
not identified because, as noted by MacCallum and Browne
(1993), the construct-level error term for a construct with formative measures is only identified when there are paths emanating
from the construct to at least two reflectively measured constructs
that are independent from each other. This suggests that when
formative-indicator constructs are an integral part of a study,
researchers must be even more careful than normal in designing
their research because procedural controls are likely to be the most
effective way to control common measurement biases.

Conclusions
Although the strength of method biases may vary across research contexts, a careful examination of the literature suggests
that common method variance is often a problem and researchers
need to do whatever they can to control for it. As we have
discussed, this requires carefully assessing the research setting to
identify the potential sources of bias and implementing both procedural and statistical methods of control. Although we clearly
have not resolved all of the issues about this important topic,
hopefully we have provided some useful suggestions and, perhaps
more importantly, a framework that researchers can use when
evaluating the potential biasing effects of method variance in their
research.
