BEYOND RELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY: TIME AND THE EFEECTS OE
SURFACE- AND DEEP-LEVEL DIVERSITY ON WORK GROUP COHESION

University of Texas at Arlington
We examined the impact of surface-level (demographic) and deep-level (attitudinal)
diversity on group social integration. As hypothesized, the length of time group members worl^ed together weakened the effects of surface-level diversity and strengthened
the effects of deep-level diversity as group members had the opportunity to engage in
meaningful interactions.
that as work group members continue to interact
with one another, dissimilarity in the typically
studied surface-level dimensions such as sex and
age becomes less important than deep-level attitudinal dissimilarity in, for instance, job satisfaction
or organizational commitment. That is, time moderates the relative impact of overt versus underlying diversity among work group members.

Projected dem^ographic characteristics of the
U.S. workforce suggest that by the year 2000, approximately 80 percent of its new entrants will
be women and members of ethnic minorities
(Johnston & Packer, 1987). The increasing diversity
of the workforce necessitates a better understanding of how such individual differences affect the
functioning of work groups, as well as which types
of differences are most consequential. Research examining the outcomes of diversity has frequently
studied demographic differences among work
group members. Consistent with Pfeffer's (1983)
work on demography in organizations, the most
commonly studied forms of diversity have been
heterogeneity in age, sex, race, and to a lesser extent, organizational tenure. The emphasis on those
variables is perhaps due to the ease with which
researchers can measure them and group members
can observe them, and also to the widespread belief
that they are reasonable proxies for underlying psychological characteristics (Bantel & Jackson, 1989;
Jackson, Stone, & Alvarez, 1993; Pfeffer, 1983; Tsui,
Egan, & O'Reilly, 1992). Attention to those variables might also be driven by legislation prohibiting employment discrimination and mandating
equal treatment without regard to race, sex, and
age.

DIMENSIONS OF DIVERSITY
Underlying Premises and Assumptions
The premise that differences among group members have a negative impact on group functioning is
the primary thesis in the relational demography
research stream, and it is the backbone of a variety
of theories in social psychology (Byrne, 1971;
McGrath, 1984; Newcomb, 1961) and organizational behavior (Jackson, May, & Whitney, 1995;
Milliken & Martins, 1996; Schneider, 1987). The
main element of group functioning that we address
is what O'Reilly, Caldwell, and Barnett (1989)
termed social integration: the degree to which
group members are psychologically linked or attracted toward interacting with one another in pursuit of a common objective. In the present study,
we concentrated on the primary affective dimension of social integration, group cohesiveness.
As we review past work in this section, we emphasize differences or heterogeneity at both the
dyad level (i.e., supervisor-subordinate relationships) and the work team or group level. Although
there may be important differences between superior-subordinate interactions and those between
team members, we have included both dyadic and
team-level diversity in this review for three reasons. First, inclusion of both types of diversity
maintains consistency with the reviews and research published by other diversity researchers

Effects of heterogeneity in these commonly studied characteristics have, however, been inconsistent across studies. Some of this inconsistency may
have arisen because the connection between overt
demographic differences among employees and the
less obvious, but important, attitudinal differences
among them is weaker than has been assumed. By
integrating theory and research from management,
psychology, and sociology, we further distinguish
between these levels of heterogeneity. We argue

(i.e., Jackson et al., 1995; Milliken & Martins, 1996;
Tsui & O'Reilly, 1989; Tsui, Egan, & Porter, 1994).
Secondly, certain basic processes, including faceto-face communication, potential for collaboration
and conflict, and influence attempts, characterize
botb dyads and larger groups, althougb the status
differences characteristic of supervisor-subordinate
interactions may modify those processes. For example, Tsui and colleagues (1994) noted that interpersonal liking in dyads could be considered similar to forms of social integration in larger groups.
Thirdly, the proposed effects of diversity rest on
assumptions in tbe similarity-attraction and selfcategorization paradigms (Jackson et al., 1993; Tsui
et al., 1992). There is little reason to expect that
these paradigms would be substantively different
for dyads and larger groups.
The terminology we use, surface- and deep-level
diversity, is similar to that found in recent theoretical work by Jackson and colleagues (1995) and
Milliken and Martins (1996). Both articles describe
diversity in readily detectable attributes (e.g., race/
ethnicity, sex, age) and underlying, deeper-level
attributes (e.g., attitudes, values). Tbese theorists
have agreed on the level (surface or deep) of several
diversity variables. Our review of the elements of
diversity is confined to variables for which there is
such agreement and for which there were available
data.
Surface-Level Diversity
Heterogeneity at a surface level can be defined as
differences among group members in overt, biological characteristics that are typically reflected in
physical features. Such characteristics include age,
sex, and race/ethnicity. Following Jackson and colleagues (1993), we view these characteristics as
generally immutable, almost immediately observable, and measurable in simple and valid ways (cf.
Jackson et al., 1995; Milliken & Martins, 1996).
Social consensus can usually be assumed for each
of these demographic attributes (Jackson et al.,
1993). That is, one's age (within some range), sex,
and race/ethnicity are generally apparent to and
agreed upon by observers.
Age. Several studies have focused on the consequences of group heterogeneity in age. Bantel and
Jackson (1989) found that heterogeneity in age was
not associated with innovations of top management
banking teams. Judge and Ferris (1993) found that
differences in superior-subordinate age significantly, negatively influenced supervisors' liking
and subsequent ratings of subordinates' performance. Tsui and O'Reilly (1989) found that age
differences were not associated with superiors' per-

97

ceptions of their subordinates' performance or with
superiors' liking of subordinates. Zalesny and
Kirsch (1989) found that heterogeneity in age was
unrelated to superiors' ratings of subordinates' performance but negatively related to peers' ratings of
co-wrorkers' performance. Heterogeneity in age was
positively associated wi\h team turnover in the
Jackson et al. (1991), Wagner, Pfeffer, and O'Reilly
(1984), and Wiersema and Bird (1993) studies. In
the Tsui et al. (1992) study, group heterogeneity in
age was negatively associated with organizational
attachment for some demographic subgroups
(white males) but was not for others (women and
minorities). O'Reilly and colleagues (1989) found
that group heterogeneity with respect to age was
associated with lower levels of social integration,
which in turn was associated with turnover. The
more distant group members were from other members in terms of age, the more likely they were to
leave.
Sex. Research on the consequences of sex dissimilarity has also yielded conflicting results. Tsui and
O'Reilly (1989) reported that subordinates whose
sex differed from their supervisors' received lower
performance ratings. Mobley (1982) hypothesized
but did not find that supervisor-subordinate similarity in sex led to higher subordinate performance
ratings. Pulakos, Oppler, White, and Borman's
(1989) analysis of military personnel found that
rater-ratee similarity in sex was not an important
influence on performance ratings. Konrad, Winter,
and Gutek (1992) found that dissimilarity in sex
resulted in isolation and dissatisfaction for women
in some situations. Finally, Tsui and co-authors
(1992) found that the organizational attachment of
white men decreased as diversity on sex increased,
but that of women (of any racial/ethnic group) did
not.
Race/ethnicity. Kraiger and Ford's (1985) metaanalysis of research from 1966 to 1981 indicated
that rater-ratee ethnic similarity was associated
with higher performance ratings. Pulakos and coauthors' (1989) meta-analysis indicated very small
and inconsistent effects of ratee-rater racial similarity across performance dimensions. Tsui and
O'Reilly (1989) reported that ethnic heterogeneity
was not associated with superiors' ratings of subordinates' effectiveness but was marginally related
to supervisors' liking of subordinates.
Summary. Of the research that has investigated
the effects of surface-level heterogeneity, findings
are inconsistent within and across studies for variables such as age, sex, and race. Studies have differed on whether or not relationships were detected
and, in some instances, on their direction. Other
researchers have also noted this inconsistency, es-

attitudes, it becomes less pleasant and more difficult for them to work together.

Deep-Level Diversity

Surface-Level Diversity, Deep-Level Diversity,
and the Moderating Influence of Time

Heterogeneity at a deep level includes differences among members' attitudes, beliefs, and values. Information about these factors is communicated through verbal and nonverbal behavior
patterns and is only learned through extended, individualized interaction and information gathering. Jackson and colleagues conceptualized a similar form of diversity, termed diversity in
underlying attributes, which included attitudes,
values, knowledge, and skills. They noted that
these aspects of individuals are more "subject to
construal and more mutable" (Jackson et al., 1995;
217] than other aspects. Milliken and Martins
(1996) made a similar statement.
The few studies that have examined the consequences of similarity in attitudes and values in
work groups have found that supervisor-subordinate attitudinal and value similarity was associated
with higher subordinate performance ratings
(Miles, 1964; Senger, 1971; Turban & Jones, 1988;
Zalesny & Kirsch, 1989) and more accurate peer
ratings (Fox, Ben-Nahum, & Yinon, 1989). One
study found that attitudinal similarity was associated with higher group cohesiveness (Terborg, Castore, & DeNinno, 1976). Turban and Jones (1988)
reported that perceptions of attitudinal similarity
were uniquely and positively related to subordinates' satisfaction, performance ratings, and pay
ratings. Miles (1964) found that attitudinal similarity between supervisors and subordinates was related to higher subordinate ratings; however, neither superior-subordinate similarity in age nor
similarity in education had a relationship with subordinates' ratings.
Unlike the few studies on deep-level diversity in
work settings, a number of social psychological
studies have reported that attitude similarity was
one of the most important predictors of attraction
and friendship (e.g., Antill, 1984; Byrne, 1971;
McGrath, 1984; Newcomb, 1961). Similarity in attitudes can ease interpersonal interaction and increase rewards when relationships are viewed
within an exchange theory framework (Thibaut &
Kelley, 1959). Further, attitudinal similarity may
facilitate cominunication; it may also reduce role
conflict, because people have similar conceptualizations of their organizations and jobs, and it may
reduce role ambiguity, because communication on
the job increases (Tsui & O'Reilly, 1989). It can thus
be inferred that as people uncover differences in

Theoretical perspectives from organizational behavior (Schneider, 1987), sociology (Allport, 1954;
Amir, 1969; Berger, Rosenholtz, & Zelditch, 1980),
and social psychology (Byrne, 1971; Newcomb,
1961) support the idea that group members base an
initial superficial categorization of other group
members on stereotypes and subsequently modify
or replace those stereotypes with deeper-level
knowledge of the psychological features of the
other individuals. Further, knowledge of attitudinal, belief, and value similarity between individuals forms the basis for continued attraction and
affiliation. Research generally supports the idea
that initial categorizations are accompanied by perceptions of similarity or dissimilarity that are based
on surface-level demographic data; these perceptions change when deep-level information is obtained (Stangor, Lynch, Duan, & Glass, 1992;
Turner, 1987). For example, Byrne and Wong
(1962) found that subjects initially perceived
greater attitudinal dissimilarity between themselves and a stranger of another race. When more
details were provided about the stranger's attitudes, perceptions of attitudinal dissimilarity decreased and interpersonal attraction to the stranger
increased. Tsui, Egan, and Porter's (1994) summary
of the vertical dyad linkage literature noted that
supervisors categorized subordinates as either inor out-group members early in relationships, when
there had been little informational exchange between the two. The authors suggested that "physical, observable, and immutable personal and background characteristics . . . play a critical role in the
initial categorization process" of group members;
(Tsui et al., 1994: 8; emphasis added). Likewise,
Tsui and colleagues (1992) noted this: "The conceptual foundation for almost all the research on
organizational demography has been the similarityattraction paradigm (Byrne, 1971). The similarityattraction hypothesis maintains that similarity in
attitudes is a major source of attraction between
individuals. A variety of physical, social, and status traits can be used as the basis for inferring
similarity in attitudes, beliefs, or personality"
(1992: 551; emphasis added).
Other researchers have noted that over time, as
people acquire more information, their perceptions
are based more on observed behavior and less on
stereotypes prompted by overt characteristics (Jackson et al., 1993; Newcomb, 1961). Further, in re-

<-----Page 3----->Harrison, Price, and Bell

1998

search on collegial choices, people have placed
greater emphasis on similarity in attitudes (beliefs)
than on ethnic similarity (Triandis, 1961), particularly when information about attitudinal differences was available or salient (Brown & Turner,
1981). Terborg and colleagues (1976) also noted
that the effect of attitude or value compatibility was
not immediate, but took time to unfold.
Evidence from the sociological literature also
supports the differential contributions of surfaceand deep-level diversity over time. Allport (1954)
and Amir (1969) are associated with the "contact
hypothesis," which states that under certain conditions, interracial or interethnic contact will result
in positive group outcomes. A key supposition of
this hypothesis is that as people interact to get to
know one another, stereotypes are replaced by
more accurate knowledge of each other as individuals, which can result in reduced prejudice and
conflict and greater group cohesiveness (Amir,
1976). Recent sociological research has supported
the general thrust of the contact hypothesis (Ellison
& Powers, 1994; Sigelman & Welch, 1993) and,
according to Amir, "Work situations provide the
best opportunities for intergroup contact" (1969:
323). Finally, Milliken and Martins suggested that
"negative affective outcomes of diversity in observable attributes [surface-level diversity] appear to
decrease with the amount of time that the group
stays together" (1996: 415-416), an idea that is
central to our argument.
Hypothesis
The preceding discussion, involving evidence
from sociology, social psychology, and organizational behavior, suggests a fundamental developmental process for diversity in work groups. The
time that members spend urorking together should
moderate the impact of diversity levels in a particular pattern (Howell, Dorfman, & Kerr, 1986). We
hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 1. Time will neutralize, or make
less important, the effects of surface-level diversity on group cohesiveness, and it will enhance, or make more important, the effects of
deep-level diversity.
METHODS
Selection of Diversity Variahles
There have been disagreements about the classification of some surface-level variables. Specifically, Jackson and colleagues (1995) included education as a surface-level attribute, but Milliken and

99

Martins (1996) considered it an underlying attribute. Since both agreed that age, race/ethnicity,
and sex were readily detectable or overt features
(Jackson et al., 1995; Milliken & Martins, 1996),
however, we used those three as surface-level variables in this study. There is less guidance in the
literature on selecting variables that reflect deeplevel diversity, which is broadly defined as including a variety of psychological characteristics (Jackson et al., 1995; Milliken & Martins, 1996). We
specifically chose dimensions of job satisfaction
and organizational commitment as elements of
deep-level diversity in this study, for a number of
reasons. First, we were limited by the organizations
involved as to what we could measure; v^^e were
restricted from measuring specific work values
(e.g., Protestant work ethic) because they had little
face validity in a survey ostensibly asking employees their opinions about working conditions. Second, both satisfaction and commitment are regarded as fundamental work attitudes; they have
been used in literally thousands of individual-level
studies, particularly as they relate to role withdrawal and organizational separation (e.g., Locke,
1976; Tett & Meyer, 1993). Third, such deep-level
variables are directly relevant to the pursuit and
attainment of a group's goals (McGrath, 1991).
Members' attitudes toward (1) their tasks, (2) the
supervisors who define and assign tasks, monitor
and assist in task completion, and reward task attainment, (3) their embedding organizations, and
(4) their overall jobs are meaningful and important in a work group. Finally, despite some classification ambiguities, our deep-level variables of
satisfaction and organizational commitment are
consistent with the Jackson et al. (1995) conceptualization of underlying dimensions of diversity.
Samples
We collected data from two samples. Sample 1
involved 39 units (groups) of employees in a medium-sized private hospital in a large southwestern
city. The total sample contained 443 people, and
groups had from 4 to 25 people. These employees
included whites (88%), Hispanics (5%), African
Americans (4%), Asians (2%), and Native Americans (1%). Most employees were women (83%).
The mean age was 37 years (s.d. = 11) and the mean
organizational tenure was 5 years (s.d. = 4). Four
percent of the employees had not completed high
school, 17 percent were high school graduates, 49
percent had completed some college work, 24 percent w^ere college graduates, and 6 percent had
completed some graduate work or had graduate
degrees. Their jobs varied from professional ones.

such as administrator, nurse (RN or LPN), pharmacist, and lab technician or radiologist, to nonprofessional ones, such as orderly or maintenance
worker. Work units reflected department, shift, and
physical location. For example, one group was
"third floor medical/surgical unit on the day shift."
Other groups were defined by function, such as the
"human resources department," because these employees had only one location and worked for only
one shift. In all cases, work groups comprised people who worked together daily on tasks in ongoing,
face-to-face interactions. There were also institutionally supported group goals and unit rewards to
promote cooperative contact among employees. In
total, these factors suggested that group members
would, over time, have had the opportunity to acquire deep-level information about one another.
Sample 2 consisted of employees in the delibakery sections of 32 grocery stores in a regional
grocery chain. An average of 13 people worked in
each deli-bakery, with group size ranging from 2 to
22 employees. The mean age was 34 (s,d, = 13), and
the mean organizational tenure was 4 years (s.d, =
3). The racial/ethnic backgrounds of employees included white (68%), African-American (17%), Hispanic (12%), and other (3%), Seventy-four percent
of the deli-bakery employees were women. Seventeen percent had not completed high school, 42
percent were high school graduates, 34 percent had
completed some college or the equivalent, and 7
percent were college graduates. Each deli-bakery
had one manager; six larger deli-bakeries also had
assistant managers. The remainder of the employees were clerks, so there were few status differences
among them. Members of each bakery-deli worked
with each other face-to-face but were relatively isolated from employees in other parts of the store.
There was no task substitution between deli-bakery
and other store workers, and there was limited
interaction outside the work group. For the delibakery employees, their group was the most salient
feature of their work environment. Again, the cooperative and interdependent nature of their tasks,
the equality of status, and the average tenure of the
work groups allowed sufficient opportunity for
members to learn deeper-level information about
one another over time.
Data Collection and Measures
For sample 1, questionnaires administered over
the course of three weeks were completed during
departmental meetings at which we were present to
give instructions and answer questions. Response
rates did not differ significantly across work groups
[x\a = 12.86, p > ,10).

February

For sample 2, questionnaires were administered
over the course of six weeks. Surveys were completed "on the clock" in a break room by 94 percent
of the deli-bakery employees. Again, response rates
did not differ significantly across groups ix^^.^ =
2.67, p > ,10), In addition, we obtained demographic data (sex, age, ethnicity, and tenure) for
each employee from company records using a special code the employees voluntarily provided at the
end of their questionnaires.
Surface-level diversity. Self-report information
regarding each respondent's age, ethnicity, and sex
were collected and then used to calculate a measure of group heterogeneity for each variable in
both samples. Age was measured in years. Racial/
ethnic background included the following categories: African American, 'Native American, Asian,
Hispanic, and white. For the deli-bakery (sample 2)
employees, self-reports were related to archival
records for age, sex, and ethnic background. Correlations of ,99 and ,98 for age and sex, respectively,
as well as 98 percent agreement for the ethnicity
categories, provided convergent validity for the
self-reports. We used the coefficient of variation to
index group heterogeneity in age, Blau's (1977) index was used to indicate within-group heterogeneity in ethnicity and sex. Various diversity researchers have discussed the advantages of both indexes
(e,g., Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Jackson, Brett, Cessa,
Cooper, Julin, & Peyronnin, 1991).
Deep-level diversity. We chose three aspects of
satisfaction and organizational commitment as
measures of deep-level diversity (recognizing that
other beliefs and values might also be relevant, as
discussed above and in "Discussion"), Satisfaction
with supervision was measured using a subscale of
the Job Descriptive Index (JDI; Smith, Kendall, &
Hulin, 1969), Values of coefficient alpha were ,78
and ,83 in samples 1 and 2, respectively. Satisfaction with work tasks was measured using another
JDI subscale (a = .76 in sample 1 and ,79 in sample
2), Overall satisfaction was measured using the
Faces scale (Kunin, 1955) in sample 1 and the Faces
scale combined with two items adapted from the
Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS; Hackman & Oldham,
1975) in sample 2 (a = .77). We transformed the
data in the latter sample to have the same possible
range as scores in sample 1, Organizational commitment was measured using the Organizational
CommitmeAt Questionnaire (OCQ; Porter & Steers,
1979), Coefficient alpha was,,83 in sample 1 and
,89 in sample 2, In both samples, we indexed deeplevel diversity by the within-group coefficient of
variation.
Group cohesiveness. The chief affective component of group functioning, group cohesiveness, was

<-----Page 5----->Harrison, Price, and Bell

1998

the dependent variable in our investigation. As in
O'Reilly et al. (1989), it was treated here as a dimension of social integration within a group. The
group cohesiveness measure was taken from Seashore (1954). Reliability estimates at the individual
level (a) were .68 and .70 for samples 1 and 2,
respectively.
We aggregated individual ratings of group cohesiveness to the group level by calculating the mean .
rating of cohesiveness within each group. Although
some researchers have expressed concern about
such aggregation (e.g., Klein, Dansereau, & Hall,
1994), we made the calculation for several reasons.
First, cohesiveness is conceptually defined at the
group level. Its meaning derives from how much
the members of a group "stick together" (Mudrack,
1989). Group-level means of cohesiveness have
been used as an index of social integration in many
studies (cf. Gully, Devine, & Whitney, 1995). Second, group cohesion is one of the most often studied outcomes in the small groups literature, and it
has been assumed to be negatively associated with
dissimilarity (Jackson and Associates, 1992). Third,
in concluding their meta-analysis of cohesion (and
performance) research. Gully and colleagues (1995)
recommended that researchers conceptualize cohesion as a group-level construct, attending to aggregation issues as necessary. One such issue is the
requirement for within-group agreement, which we
calculated for each of the 71 teams in the study
using the James, Demaree, and Wolf (1982) index.
Both the mean and the median agreement indexes
for cohesiveness were .75. Seventy-five percent of
the groups had agreement indexes of at least r.^^
equals .70. Fourth, the group-level component of
variance in cohesiveness was significant (Fgg 554 =
1.37, p < .05). Fifth, the internal consistency of the
group-level measure was .75. Given these justifications, aggregation of individual cohesiveness
scores to the group seemed reasonable.
Time spent in the group was measured in a
straightforward way. We asked group members
"How long have you been in your present job?"
(years and months). Because of skewness in the
individual (within-group) distribution of this variable, we used the median as an index of the typical
amount of time that group members had spent
working in their units.
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
A potential weakness of results might be inflation of relationships by percept-percept bias, especially because measures of both deep-level diver-

101

sity and cohesiveness were self-reports. To
examine this issue and an additional question
regarding the meaningfulness of our measures of
diversity, we conducted preliminary analyses involving other data. A small set of additional questionnaire items asked respondents their perceptions of ethnic and age differences in their work
group. Group members were asked questions about
surface-level diversity, such as "How different are
the members of your work group in their ethnic
backgrounds?" and "How different are the members of your work group in their age/experiences?"
Responses were made on a five-point scale ranging
from 0, "not at all different," to 4, "completely
different." We aggregated these perceptual measures to the group level and correlated them with
measures of diversity calculated from demographic
data. Perceptual and derived (Blau, 1977) indexes
of ethnic diversity were significantly correlated
(r = .68, p < .01), as were perceptual and derived
(coefficient of variation) indexes for age (r = .33,
p < .05). Thus, there was evidence that the ethnic
and age differences captured by the demographic
questions were "readily apparent" to employees.
However, as with the derived indexes for these
surface-level dimensions, the correlations of perceived ethnic and age differences with cohesiveness were nonsignificant (r's = -.14 and .14, respectively).
Three additional questions measured perceptions of deep-level differences in personalities, values, and interests. Perceived differences in personality were related to the coefficient of variation in
organizational commitment (r = .41, p < .05) and
job satisfaction (r = .22, p < .05). Perceived differences in values were related to the coefficient of
variation for supervisory satisfaction (r = .27 and
.31, respectively; both p < .05), and perceived differences in interests were related to supervisor satisfaction (r = .27, p < .05) and work satisfaction
(r = .22, p < .05). Group cohesiveness was significantly correlated with perceptions of differences in
all three: personality (r = -.27, p < .05), values (r =
-.25, p < .05), and interests (r = -.27, p < .05). If
our findings had stemmed only from percept-percept inflation, then both the surface- and deep-level
sets of relationships should have been significantly
and negatively correlated with group cohesiveness.
Main Analysis
The overriding question guiding this research
was whether surface-level diversity would become
less important and deep-level diversity more important in predicting group outcomes as members
of work teams spent more time together. To test this

<-----Page 6----->Academy of Management Journal

102

hypothesis, we conducted a moderated hierarchical regression analysis at the group level with
cohesiveness as the dependent variable. Control
variables (group size, mean levels of overall satisfaction, supervisor satisfaction, work satisfaction,
and organizational commitment) and independent
variables (surface- and deep-level measures of diversity, and time] were entered first into the regression equation as main effects. In the next stage of
the analyses, we created interaction terms by multiplying each of the surface- and deep-level measures of diversity by the median time group members had spent together. These interaction terms
were then entered as sets into the regression equation. Results of this two-stage regression process
are presented below. Because of the inherently low
statistical power for detecting moderators in field
data, we relaxed significance levels to p < .10 for
the interaction terms (McLelland & Judd, 1993).

ability to draw conclusions, given the small number of groups in each sample, we first combined
data from the groups into one data set. Table 1
presents means, standard deviations, and correlations among all independent, dependent, and control variables in the combined data set. We included group size in the correlation analyses and
included it as a control variable in later analyses to
remove potential confounding effects.
Results were consistent with both components of
the moderating hypothesis, as shown in Table 2.
First, declining effects for surface-level differences
were indicated by a significant improvement in
prediction for the set of the three surface-level interactions with time (Ai?^ = .09, p < .10). Most of
this effect was captured in the sex-by-time interaction [AR^ = .08, p < .10), which had a sign indicating that the initial negative influence of gender
diversity on cohesiveness was being neutralized or
weakened as group members spent more time together (Darlington, 1990). Split-sample analyses revealed that the product-moment correlation between sex diversity and cohesiveness was -.27 for
groups in the lower half of the time distribution but

.04 for the upper half (groups whose members had
spent more time together). Including the interactions
of the deep-level diversity variables with time also
had a unique effect (Afl^ = .10, p < .10). Much of this
effect was conveyed by the overall satisfaction-bytime interaction {AR^ = .05, p < .05), which had a
sign indicating that as group members spent more
time together, the impact of member differences in
overall job satisfaction was strengthened (Darlington,
1990). The correlation between diversity in overall
satisfaction and cohesiveness was .05 for groups in
the lower half of the time distribution and -.50 for
those in the upper half.

DISCUSSION
The existence of different levels of diversity has
largely been overlooked in previous empirical studies of work groups. Examination of these different
levels may help to explain the inconsistent, often
conflicting results of diversity research to date. We
proposed that diversity at a deep level has steadily
stronger consequences for groups than demographic diversity as group members spend more
time together. In a sample composed of groups from
two different populations, we found that surfacelevel differences were less iniportant and deep-

<-----Page 8----->104

level differences were more important for groups
that had interacted more often.
Although time is the variable we examined, the
fundamental medium is information. Demographic
factors are often a poor surrogate for the deeperlevel information people need to make accurate
judgments about similarity of attitudes among
group members. Time merely allows more information to be conveyed. Indeed, it might be more appropriate to think of the richness of interactions as
the conduit for information exchange (cf. Daft &
Lengel, 1986). That is, time provides the opportunity to acquire interpersonal information; the
amount of information acquired is a function of the
length of shared experience for group members, the
breadth of group activities, the depth of task interdependence, and other factors. These exchanges
allow group members to learn deeper-level information about their psychological similarity to or
dissimilarity from their co-workers, where before
they would have used surface-level demographic
data as information proxies. As previously mentioned, work in sociology also supports this contention, by demonstrating that beneficial consequences of contact among members of overtly
dissimilar groups are most likely to occur under
conditions of equal status and cooperative contact
(Ellison & Powers, 1994; Sigelman & Welch, 1993).
Interpersonal interactions under these conditions
should allow for more accurate, less stereotypical
exchanges as group members get to know one another over time.
Although our results and the proposed model
might appear to contradict much of the previous
research in this field, a careful examination of results of that research shows that they do not. For
example, one might expect that for temporary, ad
hoc groups, diversity in surface factors would play
a more important role than deep-level heterogeneity in determining cohesiveness and other forms of
social integration. Had previous research compared
the relative contributions of surface- and deep-level
variables, their findings may have been more consistent with those reported in this study, given similar opportunities for rich interactions among group
members. Watson, Kumar, and Michaelsen's (1993)
study of interaction processes and group performance within culturally diverse or homogenous (in
race/ethnicity) teams provides some converging
support for this idea. Initially, homogenous groups
interacted and performed more effectively than heterogeneous groups. Over time, however, interaction processes and performance for both groups
improved, with more rapid improvements occurring in the diverse groups. At the end of the study,
the diverse groups had grown more effective in

February

identifying problems and generating solutions than
their homogenous counterparts.
Although we have argued that deep-level variables are more important over time than surfacelevel variables in determining social integration,
one could think of situations where this would not
be the case. For example, Tsui and colleagues
(1992) pointed out that demographic variables such
as ethnicity and sex may assume more importance
when associated with differences in status. Highstatus group members (whites and men) may be
more likely to withdraw when work groups are first
integrated by members of perceived lower status
(nonwhites and women). Similarly, Konrad and
colleagues (1992) found that status differences affected outcomes for minorities and women in
group interactions. As equality of member status is
assumed to be an important foundation for information exchange, it is possible that inequality of
status may impede communication hetween highstatus and low-status group members. Additional
opportunities for shared experience, broad group
activities, and task interdependence may be needed
in such cases.
Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research
This study involved a limited set of deep-level
diversity variables. In addition to our measures,
variance in individual values regarding working
per se, working hard (e.g., Protestant work ethic), or
the proper balance between work and family might
also be important for groups in this context. Including such variables would strengthen future studies,
especially those of extremely potent work teams
(such as small, family-owned businesses).
One of the problems inherent in the selection of
which deep-level differences to study is that there
are literally dozens of conceivably important workrelated values (e.g., Meglino, Ravlin, & Adkins,
1989), cultural values (e.g., Triandis, 1989), terminal values (e.g., Rokeach, 1973), and work-related
attitudes to pick from. The relevance of each one
likely differs across situations, which is a major
theme in the budding literature on selection for
person-organization fit (e.g., Adkins, Russell, &
Werbel, 1994; Barrett, 1995; Vancouver & Schmitt,
1991). Rather than the heterogeneity in job attitudes studied in the present research, level of
agreement about, say, the proper role of the federal
government might be a strong element of deep-level
diversity for a chapter of local campus Democrats.
Differences in attitudes toward enforcing the existing covenants and restrictions on property might be
critical to the harmony of a neighborhood homeowners' association. In a jazz band or marketing

<-----Page 9----->1998

team, consensus on the value of creative freedom
might be paramount. In a day care center, the critical values to share might deal with nurturance and
patience. In a sports team, agreement about the
importance of goal directedness, dedication, or
achievement might be an overriding concern. In a
university department, agreement about the relative values of teaching and research might be most
significant. The crucial point is that the relevant
deep-level variables in any situation are those that
bear directly on the fundamental purposes of the
group. An important theoretical and research question, then, is which attitudinal differences are most
significant for which types of groups?
Another limitation was our use of a cross-sectional design. Ideally, any study of the relative influence of diversity variables on group functioning
would follow both the dependent and independent
variables over the history of the group. Present
theories give little guidance on the proper span of
time to employ, but recent organizational behavior
and social psychological research shows that a finegrained record of membership changes, interpersonal interactions, and performance over time
can yield entirely new insights about work groups
(Gersick, 1989; McGrath, Arrow, Gruenfeld,
Hollingshead, & O'Connor, 1993).
Common method variance is also a potential
limitation on this type of research. It is important
to note that percept-percept inflation is a linear
confound, showing up as an additive bias in a
correlation or regression analysis (Podsakoff &
Organ, 1986). That is, it can create spurious main
effects. However, our hypothesis predicts and the
data reveal important moderating effects. All of
these help to strengthen the argument that the
relations uncovered were a function of the constructs being studied, rather than a methodological artifact.
Finally, some other operational features would
strengthen future studies. A broader and larger
sampling of work groups (with the caveats given
above) would strengthen statistical power. And,
although we "triangulated" surface- and deep-level
characteristics to some extent, it would have been
helpful to have had other measures of social integration. Such measures might be taken from supervisory reports on the interpersonal harmony of
work groups, from company archives, or from other
records of membership changes. Consideration of
other group-level dependent variables, such as
communication processes (Gersick, 1989) and performance outcomes (Pelled, 1996), would make
useful extensions to this model.

Conclusion
Given the composition of the workforce today
and its projected future composition, understanding and predicting employee reactions to all levels
of diversity is critical. Most organizational research
on these reactions has been gloomy, suggesting that
demographic diversity diminishes work group cohesion and organizational attachment and heightens risks of employee withdrawal and turnover.
Practitioners also see heterogeneity as having negative outcomes (cf. Campion, Medsker, & Higgs,
1993). In view of their positive findings, Watson,
Kumar, and Michaelsen (1993: 599) suggested the
"dark cloud" of negative outcomes from increasing
cultural diversity might have a "silver lining." We
agree and suggest that research results indicating
many negative effects of surface-level diversity may
have also contained deeper-level similarities. Explicit recognition of these similarities may have
resulted in different conclusions. Our findings are
significant because they focus on the issue of which
levels of differences are the most important in ongoing groups. We also hope that our findings are
more optimistic than those of previous work because they focus on differences that are subject to
change, rather than those that are immutable.
