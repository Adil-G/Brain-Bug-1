TECHNOLOGY WILL DISRUPT. WHY, WHAT AND HOW?
Business, technology and people hold the key to understanding the future. 

“The future is only complex if you fail to understand it from the point of
view of what is driving the change.” – Helge Tennø, link
I help organizations understand how technology changes their customers and
in turn their business. Through this work I have created tools to tailor and
assist each company’s understanding and approach. This presentation is a
compilation of some of those tools. 
The goal is to understand what is happening, design possible scenarios and
find solutions to what is commonly and superficially labelled Digital
Transformation.

Technology will disrupt. Why, what and how?

A short summary of each chapter:
Part 1: The Complexity Gap / Asymmetric Competition
Markets are shaped by customer demand, not products. As new demands are
created companies need to stay in front of customers to accommodate their
needs or take lead in designing their future behaviors.
Unfortunately most companies are product oriented, leaving them baffled and
sidelined at industry mutations and customer oriented services entering their
markets. Understanding the customer and obsessing over them becomes the most
important leadership trait in order to recognize the new logic and make sure the
company has a stake in future economies.

QUESTION: What is your customer gap / where is your asymmetric competition
coming from?
Part 2: Fundamental Changes In The Nature Of Consumption
The concept of The Premium Puzzle states that approximately every century
customers develop new demand patterns that existing companies can’t meet. One
hundred years ago customers wanted access and material wealth – this fostered
the era of mass production and mass consumption. Today we are in the midst of a
new migration between the mass consumption era and a new era. This time the
premium puzzle isn’t access and the solution isn’t mass. Customers want
individualization and increased control.
– Shoshana Zuboff, link
Companies investing in innovation to often make investments that try to prolong the
current paradigm instead of take the company on a migration path to the next one.
(According to C.Christensen only 20% of investments in innovation is done to find
new revenue streams or business models)
QUESTION: Are you, through your innovation efforts, trying to prolong the
existing paradigm or migrate to the next zone of mutation?

The role of a company is to offer customers a set of technologies enabling them
to perform certain behaviors with a desired outcome.

In order to be inspired or learn you are now reading this article, I have also
published it as a presentation in slideshare.net and present these insights as
talks, workshops, toolboxes or master classes. All different technologies at my
disposal to aid people in assisting their desired outcome.
Two things are happening: Slow social change has transformed customer demand
(outcomes). And exponential technological change is developing new habits and
behaviors which needs to be accommodated by new technologies.
QUESTION: Are our current technologies limiting our outcome creation through
a definite number of behaviors – can we accommodate or create new
behaviors. Subtitle: do we need new technologies to accommodate present and
future economies?
Part 4: Business Strategy & The Value Chain
In Business Strategy every company is the sum or average of a set of components,
linked together in a value chain. Competitive advantage is gained through
increased optimization in one or more parts. Digital breaks up these homogenous
value chains by essentially making parts worthless, adding new components or
removing old.

Example: Sales and distribution were two of the most important parts in the
encyclopedia business value chain. Then came the Internet and the product
was given away for free online. The industry couldn’t compete because the
Internet made it’s two most important components (sales and distribution)
obsolete.

QUESTION: Which component(s) of our value chain has or is close to detach,
switch or weaken?

Part 5: Successful Innovators Don’t Care About Innovating
Successful innovators care about solving interesting problems, fueled by a deeper
understanding of and insight into human motives.

I find out what the world needs, then I proceed to invent it.” – Thomas
Edison
In other words: Companies need to organize themselves around their customers
– not their products. Which is difficult because decades of management
capitalism has thought us to organize our companies, through layers of
management, away from the customer.
The product oriented approach makes it difficult for companies to see the world
from the customer perspective and companies proceed to make investments in
their core business and core technology. Missing out on new offerings, economies
and revenue streams.

QUESTION: How does core business and industry mindsets limit our ability to
compete?
Part 6: Three Concepts To Spark Your Imagination
The Internet introduces a new set of mechanics to fit with customers emerging
habits, behaviors and demands.

The Concentrated Model & The Hidden Space – companies tend to limit their
imagination to the same space they operated in before digital. Meaning that they
limit their opportunities both when it comes to what to sell, reach of market and
how to sell it (where to find new revenue streams).
Example: If you are running a coffee shop, are you limiting your income only to
selling coffee inside its four walls? Or are you letting customers subscribe to
your experience, through home delivery of coffee beans and grinds?
Active Or Passive – traditionally companies have been passive. Interacting with
customers only when they reach out and hire the product. But, companies need to
rethink their value creation; how can we help our customers capture more value
through collaborating with us every day?
Example: Fertilizer company Monsanto collaborates with farmers every day –
through software and sensors in the fields and on farming equipment. Helping
farmers know how much, what, where and when to fertilize. Competitor Yara is
getting sidelined, choosing to stick with the old model and old infrastructure of
delivering sacks of fertilizer on the back of a truck every month or less.
Content Is The Product – companies tend to think of themselves in terms of their
products and see interactions with the customer as a cost, a marketing objective.
“But, the answer to questions like ‘Why do customers buy from us?’ don’t reside in
products. They reside almost entirely in the interactions that take place in the
marketplace.” – Steve Denning. Companies’ need to see themselves as the sum of
their customer interactions and invest in them as a part of their core deliverable.

Generation Content Is The Product
