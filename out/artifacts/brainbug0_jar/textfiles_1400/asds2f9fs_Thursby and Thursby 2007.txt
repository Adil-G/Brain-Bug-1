University licensing
Jerry G. Thursby∗ and Marie C. Thursby∗∗
Abstract Licensing of university inventions to industry has experienced rapid, recent growth. This growth
is cited as evidence of university success in technology transfer and it suggests an increasing importance of
universities to innovation systems. Concerns have been raised that universities are moving towards applied
research and away from fundamental research in efforts to capture licensing income. However, figures on
growth in licensing perhaps paint a misleading picture, given the substantial variation in licensing success
across universities, scientific fields, and technologies. The paper is organized around the following questions.
What is the rationale behind university patenting and licensing? How embryonic are university inventions and
how often is further development necessary? What is the record on exclusive versus non-exclusive licensing?
What is the record on licensing revenue? What are university licensing goals? What is the role of faculty after
a licence is signed? Have faculty been diverted from their traditional role in research?

I. Introduction
Licensing of university inventions to industry has been one of the most rapidly changing
areas in the licensing of new inventions. This growth in the USA has been closely tracked by
annual surveys by the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM). Their data
show that not only have many universities recently established Technology Transfer Offices
(TTO), but also that existing offices have expanded their patenting and licensing activities.
In Table 1 are the reported dates that TTOs were established for the 151 US non-profit

institutions (primarily universities) which provided their office starting dates in the 2004
AUTM Survey.1 The majority of institutions had started their offices in the period 1985–99.
In 1965 only 96 patents were granted to 28 US universities, but by 1992 US university
patenting had grown to 1,500 patents granted to over 150 US universities (Henderson et al.,
1998). In the most recent AUTM annual survey (2004), the 158 respondent universities
reported 3,090 US patents issued and 9,247 new patent applications. Patenting changed from
about 3.5 patents per patenting university in 1965, to 10 per university in 1992 to about 20
per university in 2004.
For the 109 US non-profit institutions responding to the AUTM survey in both 1996
and 2004, the number of inventions disclosed by faculty increased from an average of 66.9
per institution to 115.4 (a growth of 72.5 per cent).2 The average number of new patent
applications filed increased 231 per cent from an average of 22.8 per institution to an average
of 73.4 per institution. The number of licence and option agreements executed rose 71.6 per
cent from an average of 18.7 to an average of 32.1. Along with this growth in disclosures,
patents, and licences, there has been substantial growth in income. Unfortunately, only 68
institutions reported all income figures in the 1996 and 2004 surveys. For these institutions,
income net of royalties paid to other institutions and net of legal fees rose 40.6 per cent in
real terms from an average of $4.61m to $6.49m.3
A fundamental question is whether or not patenting and licensing by universities is a
sensible, efficient alternative to free and open university research. In addition, the licensing
magnitudes and growth noted above are widely cited as evidence of university success in
technology transfer and they suggest an increasing importance of universities to national
innovation systems. However, concerns have been raised that this increased activity suggests
that university scientists and engineers might be moving more towards applied research and
away from fundamental (basic) research in efforts to capture some of the gains from licensing.
In addition, these figures perhaps paint a misleading picture given that there is substantial
variation in licensing success across universities, as well as across fields within universities,
and, as regards income, across technologies.
We organize this paper around a number of questions.
1. What is the rationale behind university patenting and licensing?
2. How embryonic are university inventions and how often is further development
necessary?

What is the record on exclusive versus non-exclusive licensing?
What is the record on licensing revenue?
What are university goals from licensing?
What is the role of faculty after a licensed contract is signed?
Have faculty members been diverted from their traditional role in research?

The common answer to the first question is that patenting and licensing provides an
incentive for universities, faculty, and firms to engage in the commercialization of university
research findings. Note that the answer involves an incentive to commercialize rather than
an incentive to engage in research. University inventions are claimed to be embryonic and,
as such, in need of further development prior to commercialization. A patent issued to a
university confers a monopoly right to the invention. The university can then transfer that
right to a firm via an exclusive licence, so that the firm can appropriate returns to development.
Our second and third questions explore the embryonic state of university inventions and
the record on exclusivity versus non-exclusivity in licensing. Our next question follows
from the incentive for commercial activities provided to universities and their faculty from
licensing revenue. Since the licensing revenue can fund further research, it can serve as a
reason for university patenting and licensing.4 The picture painted by aggregate licensing
revenues such as those presented above masks the reality that income is highly skewed across
universities. Many, if not most university licensing endeavours are a net drain on university
resources, which naturally leads one to ask why universities engage in licensing, i.e. our fifth
question. University goals are not only more diverse than the generation of income alone,
but also vary across the different actors in a university (central administration, faculty, and
licensing professionals in the TTO). Finally, some have expressed concerns that the increase
in licensing activity has diverted faculty from fundamental research. This follows both from
the need for faculty in further development of licensed technologies and the potential for
research to be diverted towards the needs of industry in order to generate additional licences.
This leads to our final two questions.
In what follows we take advantage not only of the AUTM survey data, but also data
from two surveys we conducted regarding licensing of US university inventions. Both were
designed to capture objectives, characteristics, and issues in university-to-industry licensing
of university technologies. The first study was answered by university TTO licensing
professionals.5 These are the university personnel responsible for executing licences. The
second survey was directed towards industry licensing executives and was sent both to
licensing executives who actively license-in from universities and to licensing executives
who actively license-in technologies, but who do not do so from universities.6 The university
survey elicited 65 responses from universities active in licensing. In the business survey we
obtained 112 responses from firms that actively engage in licensing from universities.

If the research funding behind an invention is provided by the US government, then the Bayh–Dole Act of 1980
requires that licensing revenue be split between the university and the faculty inventors. The university portion of
revenue can only be spent on research.

rates see Jensen and Thursby (2001) and Thursby et al. (2001).

II. What is the rationale behind university patenting and
licensing?
The primary mission of universities has historically been the creation and dissemination of
knowledge. How patenting and licensing fits into this dual mission is not immediately clear;
an initial reaction to university licensing is that the activity is intended to generate income.
However, the case is not so clear. Later we consider university objectives in licensing, as
well as the available information on licensing income. For now we examine the arguments
behind allowing universities to patent. Since universities patent in order to license, these
same arguments apply to licensing. We start with the arguments behind a patent system in
general and we then proceed to a consideration of the special case of university patenting.
The legal community has emphasized two incentives for a patent system: (i) the incentive to
invent and (ii) the incentive to disclose (see, for example, Eisenberg, 1989). The incentive to
invent is based upon the monopoly rights conferred by a patent. With a patent, an inventor has
the right to exclude others from commercial use of the intellectual property rights conferred
by the patent. This allows the inventor to appropriate economic returns from her inventive
activity (Arrow, 1962). The second incentive, that to disclose, follows from the fact that the
granting of a patent carries with it the requirement that the inventor disclose the knowledge
embodied in the patent. That is, the right to exclude others granted by a patent is coupled
with the requirement that the details of the invention/innovation be made publicly available.
Thus a patent system provides an incentive for inventors to expend resources in risky
innovative activity while, at the same time, the disclosure requirement avoids having others
waste resources on duplicative research. Disclosure also allows others to build on the
invention. Note that, with these arguments, there is a natural tension between the incentives
for invention and disclosure, since, if an inventor could not exclude others from commercial
use, the inventor would have an incentive to keep secret the inventions.
These arguments are quite logical in the context of industrial research and development, but
their applicability to university research is not entirely clear. University research is typically
conducted in the context of the norms of science. As such, there exists a ‘natural’ incentive
within universities both to invent and to disclose rather than there being a tension between
the two incentives (Eisenberg, 1987).7
The traditional norm of science that is most relevant to the issue at hand is communalism.8
Communalism refers to a norm in which scientific knowledge belongs to the community (open
science). Accordingly, scientific knowledge principles should be ‘assigned to the community’
rather than the scientist, and the scientist’s claim to intellectual property from their work
should be limited to ‘recognition and esteem’. As implied by communalism, the reward
for discovery should be recognition. Stephan (1996) argues that the priority reward system
confers a form of property right that differs from the patent system in providing for incentives
to invent and disclose. The priority reward is exclusionary in that the first to discover a
principle receives the recognition and then captures the reputation for the discovery, and, as
such, it requires no separate disclosure requirement. This winner-takes-all property provides
an incentive to invent and, at the same time, it promotes the incentive to disclose. A scientist
will disclose a discovery as soon as there is sufficient evidence of validity.

7 Hall et al. (2001) find that the complementary relationship between invention and disclosure incentives in
academia serves as a barrier to the formation of university–industry partnerships.
8 The norms of science are most closely associated with the work of Merton (see, for example, Merton, 1973).

<-----Page 4----->624

Jerry G. Thursby and Marie C. Thursby

From the vantage point of the norms of science it would seem that patent rights are
needed neither to stimulate inventive activity by university scientists nor to induce them to
disclose their work. Since universities reward their researchers according to the norms of
science, there would appear to be little if any reason to patent university research.9 However,
justification for university patenting comes not from providing an incentive for university
researchers to invent; rather it comes from the need to provide an incentive to innovate. As
these terms are commonly used, inventions, while they may produce results of enormous
scientific merit, are not ready for commercial application. In contrast, innovation involves
the commercialization of inventions (Schumpeter, 1939). It is argued that university faculty
are largely engaged in invention, thus the norms of science may be regarded as sufficient to
induce university researchers to invent. However, the argument is made that innovation is
generally made outside of university labs (that is, by for-profit firms) and the norms of science
are not sufficient to induce investment in commercial application. Further, the incentives to
invent and disclose pertain to pre-patent incentives, while the incentive to innovate pertains
to post-patent incentives (Eisenberg, 1989). That is, an incentive system other than the
norms of science is necessary for firms to be willing to undertake the often costly and risky
development needed to bring an invention to market.
It is the incentive to innovate that provides much of the rationale for laws that allow
patenting of university research, such as the US Bayh–Dole Act of 1980 and similar laws
recently introduced in Europe. Basically, the Bayh–Dole Act permits universities to own,
via patenting, inventions made with the use of federally sponsored research. Universities
may then license the inventions either exclusively or non-exclusively. Any revenues must
be shared with the inventor(s). The arguments in favour of the Act rejected the norms of
science as being sufficient to induce firms to invest in developing and improving on generally
embryonic inventions that came from federal funding (Rai, 1999). The basic argument is that
rents associated with commercialization would be dissipated by competition with other firms
unless there was assignment of property rights via exclusive licensing of patented university
inventions. Only in the presence of those rights would firms be willing to make the necessary
investment. These are arguments for downstream users to invest in commercialization of
federally funded inventions.
While debates regarding the necessity of a Bayh–Dole Act focused primarily on incentives
for industry, it should be noted the Act also created ex post incentives for university
administrators and inventors to engage in commercialization. Finding firms to develop
inventions is difficult and often costly (Thursby et al., 2001). Hellmann (2007) argues that
in such a setting intellectual property rights owned either by the inventor or the university
may be important in promoting commercialization. Inventors often have tacit knowledge
necessary for commercial development, and the incentive provided by revenue sharing can
clearly play a role in commercial development (Jensen and Thursby, 2001). Finally, and
obviously, the potential for revenues to accrue to central administrations can play a powerful
role in providing incentives for universities to engage in patenting and licensing.
The incentive arguments in favour of patenting by universities rest on a key assumption
that inventions made in universities, and in particular inventions based on federally funded
research, are likely to require risky further development prior to commercial application.

9 This is all contingent, of course, on the availability of research funds. Government patronage of university
research is the norm in developed economies. While one might argue that such funding is insufficient and that
university licensing income is necessary to fund research, it is the case that at least in the USA the income from
licensing is small in relation to other sources of research funding.

However, there are conflicting views as to whether a system of exclusivity is the optimal
approach for providing incentives for development. Kitch (1977) and Merges and Nelson
(1990) provide conflicting arguments as to whether broad patent protection supports efficient
innovation.
Kitch bases his argument on the well-known commons problem. He argues that exclusive
rights allow the patent owner to invest in sole development and this, among other things,
avoids wasteful duplication of effort. He concludes that exclusivity encourages innovation.
Merges and Nelson (1990), on the other hand, argue that development by a single individual
prevents possible multiple lines of inquiry, and successful development is more likely to
occur with multiple efforts. Exclusivity prevents these uncoordinated efforts by many and
therefore exclusivity dampens innovation and creates under-development.
Heller and Eisenberg (1998) present a different reason why under-development might result
from exclusivity. When commercial application of patented inventions requires multiple
patents, an ‘anticommons’ may emerge. If the set of patents necessary for commercialization
are owned by different institutions (with possibly different goals), then transactions costs
may be so large as to discourage development. This ‘tragedy of the anticommons’ may be
particularly relevant for research tools which are often developed in universities.
To summarize, the argument can be made that patents are not necessary to provide
incentives for university scientists and engineers to invent and disclose; the norms of science
and the reward structure for science provide incentives for invention and public disclosure.
Arguments in favour of university patenting lie in the provision of incentives for firms
to commercialize university inventions. It is the embryonic nature of university inventions
and their need for further development prior to commercialization that leads to the need
for patenting and licensing. In the next section we consider the stage of development of
university inventions.

III. How embryonic are university inventions and how often is
further development necessary?
The rationale for university patenting and licensing provided above rests crucially on the
claim that many university inventions are early stage and rarely are they ready for commercial
use at the time of a patent application and/or the signing of a licence.
In both the university and the business surveys we asked respondents to indicate the
percentage of time licensed-in technologies were in various stages of development. The
results are shown in Table 2. The earliest stage technologies are those that are only a proof
of concept or for which only a lab-scale prototype is available. In both surveys we find that
the majority of inventions are in one of these stages. The university survey result is that 82
per cent are in one of these early stages and the corresponding business result is 74 per cent.
Note that 12 per cent or less of inventions are ready for commercial use.
These results refer to inventions that had already been licensed. This validates the claim
of the need for further development of most university technologies. The need for licensee
monopoly rights, of course, is an argument that the inventions are in need of costly
development and these results only support the case of a need for further development. We
do not have direct information on the cost of development, but we did ask about the rate of
failure of university inventions and found that early-stage inventions have a high failure rate.
Risky development would be consistent with costly development.

In the business survey we asked for the percentage of licensed-in agreements with
universities that had failed.10 Forty-two per cent of industry respondents indicated that
university inventions had a higher failure rate than inventions licensed from non-university
sources. There is a clear relationship between failure rates and stage of development. Those
who noted a higher failure rate for university technologies on average reported that 48 per cent
of their university licences were for technologies that were only a proof of concept; all others
reported only 31 per cent to be in a proof-of-concept stage. Further, the simple correlation
between the reported failure rate and the fraction of licences that are in a proof-of-concept
stage (the earliest stage of development) is 0.31. The correlation with the fraction that are
ready for practical or commercial use is −0.23. We also asked in our industry survey about
the percentage of time that early- and late-stage technologies were successful. Those results
again show a greater failure rate for early (72 per cent) versus late (43 per cent) stage
technologies. Not surprisingly, failure is closely related to the stage of development of the
licensed technology. With the preponderance of university technologies in early stages, it is
clear that the development of university technologies is risky.11

IV. What is the record on exclusive versus non-exclusive
licensing?
The case for university patenting appears to be simple. A patent is granted to a university and
the university then exclusively licenses the invention to a firm to provide the incentive for the
firm to engage in the further development generally needed for successful commercialization.
However, an examination of the record reveals that universities frequently licence inventions
non-exclusively. Colyvas et al. (2002), in a case study of 11 Stanford and Columbia
technologies, conclude that a number of these were ‘off the shelf’ inventions and were ready
for commercial use. Of the 11 technologies, four were essentially in that stage and three of
these were non-exclusively licensed. Of the remainder, six were exclusively licensed and

10 Specifically, we asked about technologies that were ‘not successful’, where an unsuccessful technology is one
that did not fit the need anticipated at the time of the licence—as an example, it did not reach the royalty stage.
11 We asked for reasons behind the failure of university technologies. Forty-seven per cent indicated a failure of
the technology, 26 per cent noted that the lag time to market application was longer than expected and 13 per cent
indicated that the technology would infringe on the intellectual property of others. Eighteen per cent of the time
failure of a technology was related to the failure of a faculty member to deliver know-how or cooperate in further
development.

one was not licensed. Further, they contend that early stage inventions (such as those that
are only a proof of concept) do not always need exclusivity for further development. As an
example, they note the Cohen–Boyer patented technology, which was embryonic but which
was almost immediately useful to industry. That technology was non-exclusively licensed
by the owners of the patents, Stanford University and the University of California at San
Francisco.
In the annual AUTM surveys, data are collected on the fraction of university licences
that are exclusively licensed. Interestingly, they also provide data on exclusivity by size of
the licensee. Table 3 presents the total number of licences executed by 148 US non-profit
organizations in 2004, as well as their breakdown according to firm size (start-up firm, small
firm, and large firm) and exclusivity versus non-exclusivity.12 What is immediately striking
is the very high percentage of licences (54.5 per cent) that are non-exclusive. The percentage
rises from a low of 10.1 per cent for start-up firms to a high of 64.2 per cent for large
firms. It is not the case that a count of exclusive versus non-exclusive licences is a count
of exclusively licensed versus non-exclusively licensed inventions, since the same invention
can be non-exclusively licensed many times. On the other hand, the same invention is often
exclusively licensed by field of use or by geographic area; thus, a particular invention can be
exclusively licensed multiple times. It is also the case that a single licence can incorporate
more than a single invention.
Thus, while the standard argument for university licensing rests on the need for an exclusive
licence to provide firms with an incentive to develop embryonic inventions, the evidence
suggests that exclusivity is certainly not necessary for commercialization of many university
inventions.

V.

What is the record on licensing revenue?

Above, we note the common use of non-exclusive licences. What argument can be made
in favour of such licences? In the United States all revenues from licensing of an invention
derived from research that was at least in part federally funded must be split between the
university and the inventor(s); inventors generally receive around a third of all income. The
university share can only be expended on further research. An argument can be made that
non-exclusive licences, as well as exclusive licences, increase the pool of research funds
available to universities. In this section we examine the available evidence on licensing
income to show that the distribution of income is highly skewed across universities. For many
universities licensing can be argued to be a net drain on university resources. We again rely
on the AUTM survey.

Licensing income is recorded by AUTM in four ways: (i) total licensing income;
(ii) licensing income paid to other institutions; (iii) reimbursed legal fees; and (iv) sponsored
research funds tied to a licence. These data are used to calculate income in two ways.
First, from licensing income (i) we subtract income paid to other institutions (ii). This is
licensing income from which the inventor receives a share as income and the remainder
is discretionary research income for the university.13 We then add reimbursed legal fees
(iii) to these figures. This is our first measure of income. The second measure adds sponsored
research funds tied to a licence (iv) to the first measure. Which income statistic is best for
measuring licensing income is not clear. The first is discretionary income (after subtracting
the inventor’s share) and thus can be directed towards the operations of the TTO, while the
second includes non-discretionary sponsored research funds. The second measure includes
sponsored research funds which are spent in the inventor’s lab. In interviews with university
licensing professionals we have been told that some offices discourage sponsored research
funds in their licensing agreements and some actively seek such funds. In what follows we
examine both income measures.
In Table 4 are summary statistics.14 Many offices do not report sponsored research funds,
so that the statistics for income including such funds have many fewer observations. It is clear
from Table 4 that licensing income is highly skewed since, regardless of how one measures
income, the means are substantially larger than the medians. Excluding sponsored research,
25 per cent of all offices report less than $360,000 in licence income, while the top 25 per
cent report over $5.44m.
While income data are readily available, there is little in the way of cost data. The only cost
figures recorded are legal fees expended and summary statistics are found in the last column
of Table 4. The annual fees can be substantial; the median legal fees are $462,000 while
the mean is more than $1m. The survey also reports the number of professional licensing
full-time-equivalent personnel employed in the office, as well as the number of support staff.
The mean and median numbers of professional licensing executives in these institutions are
3.95 and 3, respectively. There is a very close relationship between the number of professional
licensing executives in an office and the number of support personnel, with about 1.5 support

13

It is the case that some universities return a portion of the income to the inventor’s lab to support its research. It
is our understanding that reimbursed legal fees are excluded as income from which inventors derive their share.
14 Here and in what follows we drop the response for the University of California System since they answer for a
number of major research institutions and inclusion of their response would skew the analysis.

<-----Page 9----->University licensing

personnel per licensing executive.15 An AUTM survey of TTO salaries reports that the salary
budget for an office with the median number of professionals (director, associate director,
licensing associate, and 4.5 support staff) is $638,000 (where we have added in a 24 per
cent fringe benefit rate) (Stevens, 2005). If we consider only the legal and salary costs and
ignore all other costs, then an office with the median income, number of employees, and legal
fees expended would generate an annual net income of only about $30,000 if we exclude
sponsored research, and an annual net income of about $600,000 if sponsored research is
included. If we use mean figures, then the comparable figures are $4.2m and $5m. Clearly,
while some offices are generating substantial net income there are a very large number for
whom the office is a net drain on university resources.
Earlier, the point was made that licensing expansion had come not only from additional
institutions creating licensing offices, but also from an expansion of existing offices. The
average number of professional licensing executives at the 107 institutions reporting staff
levels in both 1996 and 2004 had risen from 3.17 to 5.38. The median had doubled from 2 to 4
licensing professionals. Above, we argue that, for many institutions, a technology office loses
money. Here, we explore that further by examining the impact of adding another professional
to the office. To do so we use the data in the 2004 AUTM survey in a regression of licensing
income on the age of the office (AGE), the number of technology transfer professionals in
the office (LICPROF), the number of licences generating licensing income (LICGLI), and
the total research expenditures of the institution (RESFND).16 There is not a causal model in
mind for this regression, rather we are simply looking for the relation between professionals
in the TTO and income, holding constant measures of institutional research size and past
experience (age and current number of licences generating income). Both measures of income
are considered and all variables are measured in logs. The results are given in Table 5. Since
all variables are in logs, the coefficients are elasticities and give the percentage change in
income from a 1 per cent change in a right-hand-side variable. Depending on whether we
include or exclude sponsored research funds, the elasticity of income with respect to licensing
professionals is 0.442 to 0.617. Both are significantly different from 1, with p-values of 0.037
and 0.06, respectively. If we again consider a case where an office has the median income
level and the median number of employees, the elasticities imply that such an office gains
an additional $253,000 of licensing income if sponsored research is included in income.
The comparable figure for income excluding sponsored research funds is $234,000. Adding
another professional, however, raises the wage bill by $161,000. Using mean values, the
comparable figures are gains of $782,000 and $950,000, respectively. Controlling for the
research size of the university and the history of the office, it is the case that, for a substantial
number of offices, increasing the size of the office is a not a profitable decision.
If, for many offices, a licensing operation is a drain on resources, then why do those
institutions continue with licensing offices? In the next section we address this question with
a discussion of university objectives in licensing.

15 In a simple regression of the number of support staff as a function of the number of professionals in the office,
the coefficient is 1.496 (p-value is 0.000) and the R2 is 0.869.
16 Results using 1996 data are similar.

VI. What are university goals from licensing?
One explanation for universities continuing to operate TTOs that are money-losing operations
is the fact that a university can ‘hit the jackpot’ with a single invention. A recent example is
provided by the cash-out of a licence by Emory University for $525m. Given the aggregate
income figures for university licensing, it is interesting that, in 2004, only 0.48 per cent of all
active licences (109 out of 22,311) and 1.24 per cent of all licences that generated income (109
out of 8,817) generated $1m or more in licensing income (AUTM, 2004). Some inventions
are extremely valuable, but most have little or no monetary value. The story, however, is
more complicated than a simple ‘jackpots model’ would suggest. University objectives are
multi-faceted. For example, in a March 2005 address, Dr Mary Sue Coleman, the President of
the University of Michigan, made the following statement in regards to university licensing:
It is not about the promise of future revenues that might be generated from this activity.
. . . Of course, revenue generation serves as an incentive. But first and foremost,
technology transfer must serve our core mission: sharing ideas and innovations in the
service of society’s well-being.
In our university survey we asked respondents about the licensing objectives of their
office. We also asked for the objectives of the central administration and faculty; these are,
of course, the objectives from the perspective of the TTO. Table 6 gives the percentage of
TTO respondents who indicated ‘extremely important’ as a measure of success for each of
five different objectives for the TTO as well as their central administration and faculty.17

17 For an analysis of these objectives, see Jensen and Thursby (2001), Thursby et al. (2001), and Jensen et al.
(2003).

Notwithstanding Dr Coleman’s comments, it is the case that licensing income is the
most important objective for the TTO and the central administration, but other goals are
also important. According to TTO respondents, funds for sponsored research are the most
important objective for the faculty they work with. Though not as important as revenue,
such funds are also an important objective for the TTO and the central administration.
Note the importance attached by the TTO to the number of inventions commercialized.
In our interviews with university licensing professionals we were told that they view the
commercialization of inventions as a measure of compliance with the Bayh–Dole Act. While
income is important, it is only one of multiple university objectives in licensing; this may
well provide some explanation for continued licensing activities where such activities are a
drain on university resources.18
Finally, Thursby and Thursby (2007a) note the substantial university emphasis on licensing,
particularly among public universities where the public expects that their universities
encourage growth. The emphasis on licensing and the fact that most, if not all, research
universities have licensing offices leads to a perception that a licensing office is necessary
in a research-oriented university. They argue that any university without a licensing office
might be viewed as non-mainstream.

VII. What is the role of faculty after a licensed contract is
signed?
Faculty are important to the licensing process not only in their role as inventors but also
in their role in identifying licensees, and, more importantly, they are often involved in the
commercialization efforts after the licence is signed (Jensen and Thursby, 2001; Colyvas
et al., 2002; Lowe, 2002; Thursby and Thursby, 2004). Respondents to our university survey
estimated that faculty were involved in further development for 71 per cent of licensed
inventions. In the business survey the comparable figure was 40 per cent. The most common
reason stated for faculty involvement is the fact that most university inventions are at an
early stage of development when they are licensed and additional development is necessary
(Jensen and Thursby, 2001; Thursby et al., 2001; Colyvas et al., 2002).
In our survey of business licensing professionals, respondents were asked the percentage
of time that faculty are involved in further development for inventions in various stages
of development at the time of licence. For technologies that are only a proof of concept
or for which only a lab-scale prototype is available (the earliest stages of an invention),

18

For more on the objectives of universities, see Thursby and Kemp (2002).

<-----Page 12----->632

Jerry G. Thursby and Marie C. Thursby

faculty are used 55 per cent and 54 per cent of the time, respectively. For technologies
which are ready for use or for which manufacturing feasibility is known—that is, late-stage
inventions—respondents indicated the use of faculty only 15 per cent of the time.
We also asked respondents for the reasons why faculty are important for further
development. Not surprisingly, the most important reason given is their specialized knowledge
(66 per cent). Only 17 per cent noted that faculty development was cheaper than in-house
development.
Firms use both sponsored research agreements and consulting arrangements when
contracting for faculty aid in commercialization. Consulting is the most common mechanism
and is used 63 per cent of the time, whereas sponsored research agreements are used 46
per cent of the time. Finally, when a decision is made not to license-in a technology, it is
common for a firm to award a sponsored research agreement for further development of the
technology. This is particularly common for early-stage technologies.

VIII. Have faculty members been diverted from their traditional
role in research?
The growth in university licensing has had supporters who point to this growth as a sign
of increasing importance of universities to innovation systems. But there have also been
detractors who express concerns that this increased licensing might be a sign of a shift of
faculty research away from the traditional university role in fundamental (basic) research.
This shift may well be due to faculty efforts to capture gains from licensing. Above, we saw
that few licences garner substantial revenues, but the temptation may still exist. In this section
we ask whether the increase in licensing reflects a shift away from fundamental research or
simply an increased willingness of faculty to have their work licensed as well as published.
This is an exceedingly difficult question to answer and we are able to provide only limited
evidence on faculty research and licensing.
In our business survey we asked respondents whether they had increased their licensing
activity with universities over the previous 5 years. Increased licensing activity was common,
with half of the respondents noting an increase. Only 16 per cent had decreased licensing
activity. For those noting an increase in agreements, the number of licences increased by 86
per cent in the year prior to the survey compared to the average of the preceding 4 years, and
their university sponsored research funding had doubled. On average these firms executed
13 licences per year and provided $13.2m in sponsored research. We asked those who had
increased licensing for the reasons behind the change. Five reasons for increasing contracts
(in addition to an ‘other’ category) were given and respondents were asked to indicate
importance using a five-point Likert scale. Percentages are given in Table 7; a ‘don’t know’
category was included in the survey but excluded from the table. For our purposes the most
important reason is the second one, that ‘Faculty research is more oriented toward the needs of
business’. Less than 11 per cent of respondents regard this as an extremely important reason
for the increase. Note that university receptivity is more important than either costs or faculty
research orientation; three times as many respondents recorded a 1 (extremely important) for
‘universities’ receptivity’ as recorded a 1 for ‘costs’ or for ‘faculty orientation’. While the
most important reason for increasing contacts is ‘university receptivity’, the fact that almost
11 per cent of respondents noted that a change in the orientation of faculty towards the needs
of business was extremely important may be regarded by some as alarming.

The greater importance of university receptivity relative to faculty interests is reflected in
the results in Thursby and Thursby (2002), in which the largest source of growth in university
licensing comes from the propensity of central administrations to engage in licensing rather
than from the propensity of faculty to engage in such activity.
We developed a data base of the research, demographic, and disclosure profiles of a group
of faculty scientists and engineers at 11 major universities in an effort to understand more fully
the characteristics of faculty who engage in the licensing process. These data also allow us to
compare the research profiles of those who do and those who do not engage in licensing. The
universities are Cornell, MIT, Pennsylvania, Purdue, Texas A&M, Wisconsin—Madison,
Utah, Harvard, Stanford, the California Institute of Technology, and the Georgia Institute of
Technology.19 The choice of universities is not random. Important research universities with
substantial licensing activity such as these are central to the concerns about licensing activity
and university research.
Our measure of faculty interest/engagement in licensing is the disclosure of inventions by
scientists and engineers. Licences executed are not considered. While disclosures and licences
are not independent, the former are more representative of faculty interest and the latter more
representative of commercial quality. An invention disclosure indicates that an inventor has a
research result that she believes has commercial potential and it also indicates that the inventor
is interested in the licensing process. All universities in the sample require that employees
file disclosures when they have an invention with commercial potential, but this requirement
is hardly enforceable. In some cases faculty might not disclose because they are unaware
that their idea has commercial potential, but it is often the case that faculty are unwilling
to risk delaying publication during the patent and licence process.20 Those whose work is
most fundamental might choose not to disclose because of the time commitment necessary
for further development towards commercialization. Note that, while a disclosure signals
a willingness to be involved with licensing, it is not necessarily the case that the research
behind the disclosure was motivated by the desire to license. Curiosity-driven research can
lead to inventions with commercial potential. In interviews with MIT mechanical engineering

19

A more complete analysis of six of these universities is found in Thursby and Thursby (2007b).
One-half of the firms in our industry survey noted that they include delay-of-publication clauses in at least 90
per cent of their university contracts. The average delay is nearly 4 months, with some firms requiring as much as a
year’s delay.
20

<-----Page 14----->634

Jerry G. Thursby and Marie C. Thursby

faculty, Agrawal and Henderson (2002) found that most conducted research with the primary
goal of publishing.
The faculty we study are from the National Research Council’s (NRC) 1995 report on
faculty in US Ph.D.-granting departments; the faculty list is for the year 1993. The exclusion
of faculty in non-Ph.D. departments is not a drawback, since the bulk of departmentally
based research takes place in those that grant the Ph.D. A major exclusion is the faculty
in medical schools unless they also hold appointments in Ph.D.-granting departments. We
exclude faculty in departments where research could not, in general, lead to inventions with
commercial potential. For example, we exclude astronomy.
The TTO of each university supplied the list of all disclosures as well as the names of
the disclosers. Four universities provided disclosure information for 1983–99, and the others
provided information from 1983 to 1996 and from 1987 to 1999.21 Matching these files with
the NRC list gives a sample over multiple years of disclosure (or non-disclosure) activity for
faculty of the 11 universities. Note that, by use of the NRC list of faculty we exclude any who
joined the university after 1993 or who left the university before 1993. For years other than
1993, we check a variety of sources to ensure that the faculty in our sample were actually
employed at the universities. In our sample, we have 4,988 faculty and 60,905 observations,
where an observation consists of a person observed in a certain year (person/year).
For each faculty member in our sample, it is known whether or not she disclosed in each
year that she was on the faculty. The sample includes 5,133 observations in which the faculty
member disclosed an invention (this is 8.4 per cent of the total sample of person/years). In the
remainder of the paper, ‘disclosure’ indicates that a researcher has disclosed at least once in a
given year; that is, that she has demonstrated a willingness and ability to engage in licensing
activity.
Table 8 gives the number of observations for each year as well as the percentage of those
observations that are disclosure observations; that is, observations on a faculty member who
has disclosed in a given year. The percent of disclosure observations rises from 2.7 per cent
of the faculty in 1983 to around 10–11 per cent by the mid-1990s, where it appears to have
levelled off. This trend in disclosure activity is in agreement with our earlier observations
about the growth in university licence activity.
Disclosure activity involves about one in ten faculty by the mid-1990s, but how is that
activity distributed across faculty? Table 9 provides the number and percentage of disclosures
by each scientist or engineer over the entire sample period. In light of the attention that
has been given to university licensing and the fact that about one in ten of these faculty
are disclosing late in the sample period, the number of faculty who ever express an interest
is low. Of the 4,988 faculty in the sample, 63.5 per cent never disclosed an invention and
another 14.6 per cent disclosed in only one year. Only 109 faculty (2.2 per cent) disclosed in
eight or more of the years they were in the sample (not shown in the table).
Our data include the publication records of the scientists and engineers. To examine the
nature of research and how it changed over time and in relation to disclosure activity, we
mapped each faculty member’s journal publications into Narin et al.’s (1976) classification
of the ‘basicness’ of journals. By their definition, basic journals are cited more by applied
journals than vice versa, so that the more basic a journal, the more cited it is by other journals.

21 We started with 1983 so as to be well past the date of passage of the Bayh–Dole Act of 1980. Universities
supplied us with data as far back as disclosure information could easily be retrieved. The 1996 end was for Purdue
University. Purdue was the basis for our pilot study in this project and that pilot was initiated in 1997, hence we only
collected data through 1996.

As an example, if journal A is heavily cited by journal B, but B does not tend to be cited by
A, then A is said to publish more basic research than does B. About 62 per cent of all ranked
journal publications are in the top basic category—a five-point scale is used. Only those
publications in that category are defined here to be basic. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of
the publications for our sample could not be rated, but we found no systematic change over
time in the number of publications that could be rated.22
Since there is no information on faculty who, in a given year, did not have any publications
in journals rated by Narin et al. (1976), they are dropped from the sample. This leaves 15,821
observations. It is then assumed that for this group of observations the fraction of total
publications that are basic is the same as the fraction of rated publications that are basic. The
average number of basic publications per faculty member is 4.81, while the average number
of publications is 6.98. To examine the relation between basic publications and disclosures
we regress the number of basic publications on the total number of publications (TOTPUBS)
and an indicator variable of whether the faculty member disclosed an invention (DISC = 1
if there was a disclosure, 0 otherwise). A year fixed-effects model is used. The coefficient

22 In a regression of the fraction of rated publications (where we drop observations with no publications, rated or
otherwise) on a set of indicator variables for the year of the observation, we found an R2 of only 0.0016 and very
few significant differences in the coefficients of early versus later years.

<-----Page 16----->636

Jerry G. Thursby and Marie C. Thursby

of DISC is −0.424 and has a p-value of 0.000. Thus, the basic publications fall by almost a
half of a publication if the observation is for a year in which the faculty member discloses
an invention. At the mean value of basic publications this is a decrease of 8.8 per cent. Note
that we can say no more than that there is a negative relationship between disclosures and
basic publications. It is possible that engaging in disclosure activity reduces the amount of
fundamental work, as implied by Link and Scott’s (2003) interviews with provosts of select
universities. Alternatively, it is also possible that those who do less fundamental work are
more likely to make discoveries that are commercializable.
Since only about 10 per cent of the faculty in our sample were disclosing by the late 1990s,
this would suggest an overall small reduction in basic publications. In Figure 1 are the time
trends for publications per faculty member, as well as our measure of the number of basic
publications per faculty member. The two trends are slightly upward over time but they bear
a close relationship to each other.
Our final question relates not so much to faculty diversion from research, as to a simple
question of the profile of inventors in the years that they disclose versus years in which they
do not disclose. We use a logistic regression of whether or not an observation is a disclosure
observation as a function of a set of characteristics of the inventor and their university.
The dependent variable takes on the value of 1 if the observation is a disclosure year
observation. Regressors include the total number of publications in that year (TOTPUBS).
For each publication we also have the total number of citations received by that article
through 2003. The aggregate of these citations (TOTCITES) for the year in question is
included. That is, for each of the articles in TOTPUBS we include the aggregate of their
citations through 2003 (TOTCITES). For each article in TOTPUBS we also have the number
of these in which the inventor is listed as the first author (FIRSTAUT). We also include
an indicator variable for the major programme field of the inventor: ENG = 1 if the
inventor is in an engineering field; BIOSCI = 1 if the inventor is in a biological science
field. The omitted field is physical sciences. The NRC (1995) report includes a measure
of quality of each department. We include that measure (DEPTQUAL) where the measure
ranges from 0 to 5, with 5 indicating a distinguished department. We also include the age
of the inventor at the time of the licence (AGE) and an indicator variable for the gender

of the inventor (MALE = 1 if the inventor is male). For eight of the 11 universities we
have the annual sponsored research funds by inventor. This is broken down into federalgovernment-sponsored research (FEDFND), industry-sponsored research (INDFND), and
sponsored research from other sources (OTHERFND). Finally, we also include indicator
variables for the year and university; these are not reported.
Results are given in Table 10. Rather than present the estimated coefficients, Table 10
presents the odds ratios.23 After dropping observations with missing data, the number of
observations is 32,927. The pseudo-R2 is 0.0966, and the chi-square statistic for overall fit
has a p-value of less than 0.0000. With the exception of OTHERFND, all regressors are
significant at the 1 per cent level. Engineers are most likely to disclose and faculty in the
biological sciences are least likely to disclose. Not surprisingly, those who publish the most
are most likely to disclose, since publications are an indication of more research. Those who
are most cited are also more likely to disclose, but first authorship is associated with a lower
probability of disclosure. Older inventors and faculty in higher-quality departments are less
likely to disclose. Men are more likely to participate in licensing. Additional research funds
lead to more disclosures and industry funds have about twice the impact on licensing as do
federal funds.

IX. Conclusion
Licensing of university inventions to industry has witnessed rapid growth over the last few
decades. A fundamental question is whether or not patenting and licensing by universities
is a sensible, efficient alternative to free and open university research. In addition, licensing
magnitudes and growth are widely cited as evidence of university success in technology
transfer and they suggest an increasing importance of universities to national innovation
systems. However, concerns have been raised that this increased activity suggests that
university scientists and engineers might be moving more towards applied research and away
from fundamental (basic) research in efforts to capture some of the gains from licensing.

23 An odds ratio gives the effect of a unit change in a right-hand-side variable on the ratio of the probability of a
disclosure divided by one minus the probability of a disclosure. Hence, an odds ratio of less than one implies that
the right-hand-side variable has a negative effect on the probability of disclosure.

In this paper, we have addressed many of the issues and much of the evidence surrounding
university patenting and licensing. The paper has been organized around a number of
questions.
1. What is the rationale behind university patenting and licensing?
Arguments in favour of university licensing surround the need for firms to have
exclusive rights to university inventions in order to develop these generally embryonic
inventions into commercial products.
2. How embryonic are university inventions and how often is further development
necessary?
The available evidence supports the argument that university inventions are generally
embryonic and in need of further development. However, it is also the case that many
inventions, including some that are embryonic, are ready for commercial use and
therefore not in need of further development.
3. What is the record on exclusive versus non-exclusive licensing?
While the need for exclusivity for some inventions is apparent, about half of all
university licences are non-exclusive. An argument for non-exclusivity can be based
on the need for additional university research funds. This leads to our next question.
4. What is the record on licensing revenue?
The data suggest that licensing for many if not most universities is a net drain on
university resources. If so, why do universities engage in such activity? This leads to
our next question.
5. What are university goals from licensing?
Survey evidence suggests that licensing income is not the only goal of licensing. In
particular, the commercialization of university inventions is also a goal.
6. What is the role of faculty after a licensed contract is signed?
Faculty often play a very important role in developing their inventions after a licence
has been signed. It is their special expertise that makes them valuable to the licensee.
This leads to our final question.
7. Have faculty members been diverted from their traditional role in research?
The perception of substantial income from licensing and the need for faculty in further
development has led to the concern that licensing possibly has diverted faculty from
their traditional role in fundamental research. This is a very difficult question to test
with data. We provide evidence that only a minority of faculty are involved in the
licensing process. A look at changes in publications does not reveal a substantial shift
towards applied research.
