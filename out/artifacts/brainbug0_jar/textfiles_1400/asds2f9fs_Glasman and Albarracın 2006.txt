Forming Attitudes That Predict Future Behavior: A Meta-Analysis of the
Attitude–Behavior Relation
Laura R. Glasman and Dolores Albarracı́n
University of Florida
A meta-analysis (k of conditions ⫽ 128; N ⫽ 4,598) examined the influence of factors present at the time
an attitude is formed on the degree to which this attitude guides future behavior. The findings indicated
that attitudes correlated with a future behavior more strongly when they were easy to recall (accessible)
and stable over time. Because of increased accessibility, attitudes more strongly predicted future behavior
when participants had direct experience with the attitude object and reported their attitudes frequently.
Because of the resulting attitude stability, the attitude– behavior association was strongest when attitudes
were confident, when participants formed their attitude on the basis of behavior-relevant information, and
when they received or were induced to think about one- rather than two-sided information about the
attitude object.

stability

Given large variability in attitude– behavior consistency, researchers have specified conditions that make attitudes predict
behaviors (Borgida & Campbell, 1982; Fazio & Zanna, 1978a,
1978b; Kraus, 1995; Schwartz, 1978; Sivacek & Crano, 1982).
Past research has revealed that attitudes people hold with confidence predict behavior better than the ones people doubt. Decisive
attitudes also predict behavior better than ambivalent or internally
inconsistent ones. Similarly, easily recollected attitudes predict
behavior better than attitudes that are difficult to recall. Further,
attitudes based on direct experience promote greater attitude–
behavior consistency than those based on indirect experience (for
a meta-analysis, see Kraus, 1995).
Despite the value of past research on moderators of the attitude–
behavior relation, there are two limitations. First, past research on
these issues has often been correlational (e.g., Bagozzi, 1981;
Bentler & Speckart, 1981; Davidson & Jaccard, 1979; Fazio &
Williams, 1986; Fazio & Zanna, 1978a; Lavine, Thomsen, Zanna,
& Borgida, 1998). Thus, it has not been able to demonstrate
whether attitudes predict behavior because they are more confident, memorable, or decisive. Second, the past research relying on
experimental methods (see Doll & Ajzen, 1992; Fazio, Powell, &
Williams, 1989; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; Sengupta & Fitzimons,
2000; Wilson, Dunn, Bybee, Hyman, & Rotondo, 1984) has been
insufficient to conclusively establish the processes underlying the
attitude– behavior relation. To further complicate matters, 8 out of
10 prior meta-analyses of the attitude– behavior relation (i.e., Armitage & Conner, 2001; Eckes & Six, 1994; Farley, Lehmann, &
Ryan, 1981; Kim & Hunter, 1993; Notani, 1998; Sheppard,
Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988; Van den Putte, 1993; D. S. Wallace,
Paulson, Lord, & Bond, 2005) focused on the role of factors other
than attitudes (e.g., the mediating role of intentions on the attitude–
behavior link, how type of topic or behavior moderates the
attitude– behavior relation). The remaining 2 meta-analyses, which
did consider the role of attitudes (i.e., Cooke & Sheeran, 2004;
Kraus, 1995), were more descriptive than process oriented.

For many decades, social psychologists have attempted to influence people’s attitudes to elicit corresponding behaviors (see
Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Ajzen & Madden, 1986;
Bargh, Chen, & Burrows, 1996; Fazio, 1989, 1990; Fazio, Chen,
McDonel, & Sherman, 1982; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; for a recent
review of the effects of attitude-influence strategies on real-world
behaviors, see Albarracı́n et al., 2003). For example, a message
reporting the benefits of a new vaccine may stimulate perceptions
that the vaccine is indispensable. Hence, it may increase the
probability that people will opt to receive the vaccine. Important
for our analysis, however, inducing provaccine attitudes at one
point in time does not guarantee that people will choose to receive
the vaccine (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Albarracı́n et al., 2003).
Instead, there is considerable variability in the degree to which
attitudes predict behavior (Ajzen, 2000): Mean correlations between attitudes and actual behaviors have ranged from ⫺.20
(Leippe & Elkin, 1987) to .73 (Fazio & Williams, 1986).

In light of this situation, the objective of our work is to begin
resolving this deficiency by pooling evidence from experimental
or quasi-experimental designs that dealt with attitude formation.
That is, we selected studies about creating a new attitude in an
audience, be that by presenting information or by identifying
situations in which participants learned about a new object in
real-world settings. These studies varied in their use of diverse
experimental manipulations (e.g., number of attitude expressions,
distraction, consistency among attitude components, personal relevance). They also varied in other factors that presented incidental
differences across studies (e.g., the accessibility and stability of
attitudes, the relation between attitudes and behavior-relevant information, and the confidence with which attitudes were held).
Therefore, synthesizing these studies permitted us to examine the
influence of all these variables. The synthesis was conducted with
the guidance of a model of the processes that underlie the attitude–
behavior correspondence.
To date, two theoretical perspectives have specified the processes by which attitudes guide behaviors. These approaches have
also pointed to conditions that moderate these processes. A first
approach assumes that attitudes influence behavior when actors
activate them from memory. Attitudes appear to be easily accessible (and thus influential of behavior) when they are based on
direct experience (Regan & Fazio, 1977). They are also more
accessible when the people who form them are highly motivated to
think about the attitude object (Cacioppo, Petty, Kao, & Rodriguez, 1986). It is assumed that both direct experience and personal
involvement induce individuals to think about their attitudes. In
turn, this cognitive work increases the frequent availability of
attitudes as a basis for future behavior (Petty, Haugtvedt, & Smith,
1995).
A different line of research suggests that attitudes influence
behavior when actors can reconstruct them on the fly. According
to the constructionist point of view, constructing initial and later
attitudes on the basis of the same information makes the initial
attitudes stable (Erber, Hodges, & Wilson, 1995) and thus predictive of behavior (Wyer & Srull, 1989). It is important to note that
attitudes should be most stable when the information that guided
them continues to be relevant or diagnostic at the time the person
performs the behavior (Ajzen, 1996). In addition, people can
construct stable attitudes if all the information they have about an
object is one-sided or homogeneous (Erber et al., 1995). People
who anticipate only positive outcomes when they form an attitude
toward a behavior may maintain the same attitude in light of
different outcomes that are also positive. In contrast, individuals
may change their attitudes when these attitudes are based on
information with diverging evaluative implications at different
points in time.
Clearly, there is much high-quality research on the attitude–
behavior correspondence. However, this research has not been
integrated into a comprehensive model. For example, researchers
have found that the attitude– behavior relation is stronger when the
measures of attitude and behavior are correspondent (e.g., Ajzen &
Fishbein, 1977; Davidson & Jaccard, 1979; Jaccard, King, &
Pomazal, 1977). It is also stronger when individuals do not expect
to discuss their attitudes with others (Leippe & Elkin, 1987).
Further, the relation is stronger when there is an association
between attitudes and information relevant to the behavior (Ajzen,
1996; Doll & Ajzen, 1992) and the focus (e.g., thoughts about the

779

instrumental properties of an object) is the same while the person
is reporting the attitude and performing the behavior (e.g., an
instrumental rather than hedonistic behavior; Millar & Tesser,
1986, 1989). Likewise, consistent attitudes (Jonas, Broemer, &
Diehl, 2000), attitudes formed on the basis of direct behavioral
experience (Regan & Fazio, 1977), and attitudes formed with high
motivation to think about the attitude object (Sivacek & Crano,
1982) all appear to predict behavior better. However, empirical
research has not explicated why these apparently heterogeneous factors have similar impact. Furthermore, when researchers have linked some of these factors to the accessibility and
stability of attitudes (e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989; Fazio et al.,
1982; Fazio, Powell, & Herr, 1983; Houston & Fazio, 1989), they
have rarely tested all of the paths representing these processes (but
see Doll & Ajzen, 1992).
Finally, findings regarding the attitude– behavior relation are not
as robust as they appear. For example, ambivalent attitudes have
often influenced the attitude– behavior relation in a negative way
(Conner, Povey, Sparks, James, & Shepherd, 2003; Conner et al.,
2002). However, there is research (e.g., Jonas, Diehl, & Broemer,
1997; Sengupta & Johar, 2002) showing a positive relation. Similarly, attitudes based on direct experience reportedly predict behavior (Regan & Fazio, 1977). However, research has also shown
that this is not always the case (Millar & Millar, 1996).
Given the scope and diversity of the attitude– behavior research,
meta-analytical methods are ideal to integrate the findings and
resolve inconsistencies. It is notable, however, that the attitude–
behavior meta-analyses addressing this problem to date have been
limited. For instance, Kraus’s (1995) meta-analysis found that
attitudes influenced behavior when attitude accessibility, stability,
certainty, affective– cognitive consistency, and direct experience
with the attitude object were high. Similarly, Cooke and Sheeran’s
(2004) review found that attitude accessibility, stability, certainty,
ambivalence, direct experience, and affective– cognitive consistency influenced the attitude– behavior relation. However, their
analyses investigated neither the interrelations among these moderators nor the processes underlying their influence on the
attitude– behavior relation. To the extent that the different moderators are highly correlated, the univariate associations with the
attitude– behavior association may be spurious. Therefore, in the
present meta-analysis we have more precisely identified the unique
contribution of each moderator and tested the causal mechanisms
at hand.1
1

There are at least eight other meta-analyses that have explored issues
concerning attitude– behavior correspondence. Kim and Hunter (1993)
examined the effect of the correspondence between the attitude and the
behavior measures across different topics. D. S. Wallace et al. (2005)
assessed the impact of situational factors associated with the behavior (e.g.,
perceived difficulty of the behavior, social constraints to perform the
behavior). Eckes and Six (1994) examined the influence of measurement
correspondence, time interval between attitude and behavior measures,
number of behavior alternatives, and behavioral domain. Two other metaanalyses focused on the theory of reasoned action and the factors that
moderate the relations proposed by that theory (i.e., Farley et al., 1981;
Sheppard et al., 1988). The remaining three explored the relations proposed
by the theory of planned behavior and the moderators of those relations
(i.e., Armitage & Conner, 2001; Notani, 1998; Van den Putte, 1993).

GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

Another limitation of prior meta-analyses is that they have
included designs that do not reveal the influence of attitude accessibility and stability. This situation is problematic. For example,
both Kraus’s (1995) and Cooke and Sheeran’s (2004) metaanalyses found that attitude certainty, consistency, and stability
were associated with greater attitude– behavior correlations. However, these studies could not determine whether stable reports of
attitudes resulted from greater attitudinal confidence and consistency. In fact, stable attitude reports can also cause more confident
and consistent attitudes. Similarly, Kraus (1995) and Cooke and
Sheeran (2004) found that highly accessible attitudes were stronger predictors of behavior. However, their approach cannot precisely determine the direction of this effect. That is, an association
of accessible attitudes with behavior in an integration of research
using familiar objects might indicate that past experiences with
those objects caused both accessible attitudes and behavior.
To resolve these deficiencies, we selected studies on the
attitude– behavior relation in which experimenters created attitudes
about unfamiliar objects. Correspondingly, we excluded studies
involving manipulations or measures of attitudes toward wellknown objects. The focus on new attitudes helped us to control
various aspects of attitudes. That is, participants cannot have
previous attitudes toward unknown objects. Hence, attitudes about
these objects must largely reflect the information and conditions
present at the time of the attitude formation. In addition, the
stability and accessibility of new attitudes should be relatively
independent of past thoughts about the issue, past behaviors in the
particular domain, and past attitude reports. One cannot control
these factors in research with familiar objects—studies have rarely
measured or manipulated all these aspects of attitudes.
Finally, the focus on attitude formation has implications for the
solution of real-world problems. Private and public agencies frequently face the challenge of inducing new behaviors (e.g., purchase of hybrid and electric cars, participation in a newly recommended health screening, purchase of a new product category,
introduction of a new political party). These agencies often attempt
to meet this challenge by eliciting behavior-congruent attitudes.
With the current state of the literature, however, it is unclear
whether it is more effective to discuss the advantages (e.g., Jonas
et al., 2000) or the advantages and disadvantages (Jonas et al.,
1997; Sengupta & Johar, 2002) of a new behavior or whether it is
better to let audiences acquire experience with the behavior (Fazio
& Zanna, 1978a, 1978b; Regan & Fazio, 1977). Therefore, a
well-organized body of knowledge on this topic is essential.

Processes Involved in the Attitude–Behavior Relation
Two lines of research have implications for the attitude–
behavior relation. One has established that easy-to-retrieve attitudes predict behavior better (Fazio & Williams, 1986). In addition, constructionist perspectives (Schwarz & Bohner, 2001;
Wilson & Hodges, 1992; Wyer & Srull, 1989) suggest that stable
information on which to form attitudes ensures high attitude–
behavior relations. These processes appear in Figure 1.

Attitude Accessibility
According to Fazio (1989), people’s attitudes are more likely to
guide behavior when they are easy to retrieve from memory. There

are two main premises for this hypothesis. First, more accessible
attitudes are likely to be available as criteria for a later behavioral
decision (Fazio, 1989; Fazio et al., 1989; Fazio & Williams, 1986).
In addition, accessible attitudes influence the interpretation of
information associated with the attitude object (Fazio et al., 1983;
Fazio & Williams, 1986). For example, people with accessible
negative attitudes about African Americans who encounter an
African American man holding a tool may perceive the man as
holding a weapon (Allport & Postman, 1947).
In brief, accessible attitudes allow people to make behavioral
decisions and process relevant information (Fazio, 1989). Further,
if attitude accessibility increases the attitude– behavior association,
so should conditions that increase attitude accessibility. For example, attitude– behavior correspondence is particularly strong when
people think carefully about the issue (Cacioppo et al., 1986). It is
assumed that more thought about an issue increases the accessibility of the attitude associated with that issue. In addition, repeated expression of the attitude and direct behavioral experience
are associated with both greater attitude accessibility and greater
attitude– behavior correspondence (Fazio et al., 1982; Powell &
Fazio, 1984; Regan & Fazio, 1977). In all, this research suggests
that greater amount of thought about the attitude object, greater
number of reports or expressions of the attitude, and more direct
behavioral experience should increase attitude accessibility and,
consequently, attitude– behavior associations (see the upper section of Figure 1).

Attitude Stability
People often retrieve and use their prior attitudes as a basis
for a behavior. However, they also adjust these attitudes on the
basis of information available at the time of the behavior
decision (Schwarz & Bohner, 2001; Wilson & Hodges, 1992).
Thus, the stability of information associated with attitudes can
increase attitude– behavior correspondence (Ajzen, 1996; Doll
& Ajzen, 1992). As shown in Figure 1, the behavioral relevance, the one-sidedness of the attitude-related information,
and the confidence with which the attitude is held all stimulate
attitude stability.
Behavioral relevance of attitude-related information. Presumably, the stability of the information that gives way to attitudes
increases the attitude– behavior relation. Hence, people should
display greater attitude– behavior correspondence when the initial
information is relevant at the behavior point. In this regard, individuals who have direct behavioral experience with an attitude
object may obtain information that is more relevant to performing
a behavior. Therefore, they should form more stable attitudes and
have stronger attitude– behavior correlations (Ajzen, 1996; Ajzen
& Sexton, 1999). Similarly, the formation of attitudes toward
behaviors and of attitudes highly associated with beliefs about
behavior outcomes may influence attitude– behavior correspondence. That is, having behavior-relevant attitudes should facilitate
a later behavioral response. In contrast, attitudes about objects and
attitudes unrelated to behavioral outcomes may require additional
cognitive work to guide behavior.
There are also contextual conditions that affect the relevance of
an attitude for a behavior. For example, individuals often report
their attitudes to others but perform their actual actions in private.
When public–private correspondence is low, attitudes should be

poor predictors of behavior. In these cases, people’s attitudes may
not apply if the context changes from public to private or vice
versa (Kraus, 1995; Leippe & Elkin, 1987; Schlenker, 1980).
Hedonic–instrumental correspondence appears to operate in
a similar way. Hedonically oriented behaviors, such as playing,
tend to be affectively driven. Instrumentally oriented behaviors,
such as studying for a test, are more cognitively driven (Millar
& Millar, 1998; Millar & Tesser, 1992). Therefore, focusing on
feelings at the time of the information reception may facilitate
the attitude– behavior correlation when the behavior is hedonic.
Moreover, focusing on feelings may decrease attitude– behavior
correspondence when the behavior is instrumental. The reverse
is also true. Focusing on cognitions may increase the attitude–
behavior correspondence when the behavior is instrumental.
However, a cognitive focus may decrease correspondence when
the behavior is hedonic (Millar & Tesser, 1986). Thus, higher
hedonic–instrumental correspondence should be associated
with stronger attitude– behavior correlations (see the lower
panel of Figure 1).

It is notable that the degree to which one thinks about an attitude
object can interact with the information about which one thinks
(see the lower panel of Figure 1). For example, people who
initially report attitudes toward a behavior can use those attitudes
as a basis for behavior later. Similarly, people who report attitudes
in public can easily apply these responses when the behavior is
public. This correspondence may improve the attitude– behavior
relation even when people initially lack ability and motivation to
think about the issues at hand. However, high motivation and
ability to think about the attitude object (high amount of thought)
may lead one to form attitudes toward behaviors. It may also lead
one to consider one’s behavior in alternative contexts. Thus, the
behavioral relevance of attitudes may not matter when ability and
motivation are high.
One- versus two-sided attitude-related information. Attitudes
are more likely to be stable and predictive of behavior when the
evaluative implications of the initial information are the same at
the behavior point (Erber et al., 1995). Thus, univalent information
about an object should lead to stronger attitude– behavior correla-

<-----Page 4----->GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

782

tions than bivalent information (Conner et al., 2002, 2003; Erber et
al., 1995; Jonas et al., 2000).
At the time they form an attitude, two factors may induce people
to link their attitudes with one-sided information.2 First, people
can simply receive, gather, or generate (e.g., by answering questions) one-sided information (see Figure 1). Second, greater
thought about an issue may increase one’s tendency to organize the
associated information in a coherent, one-sided way (Sengupta &
Johar, 2002; Tesser & Cowan, 1977). Therefore, given a minimum
level of thought to form an attitude, receiving or generating onesided information should increase the attitude– behavior relation.
However, only higher levels of thought produce strong attitude–
behavior associations when the available information is evaluatively conflicting.
Attitude confidence. People who doubt their attitude should be
more likely to attempt to reconstruct it than people who think that
their attitude is correct. As a result, attitude confidence may
increase the attitude– behavior correspondence by mediating effects on attitude stability (Albarracı́n, Wallace, & Glasman, 2004;
Pelham, 1991; see also Tormala & Petty, 2002, Experiment 4, for
more indirect experimental evidence).
At least three factors can influence attitude confidence. First,
greater amounts of thought can induce attitudes that are based on
solid information, which, in turn, increases attitude certainty
(Berger, 1992; Krishnan & Smith, 1998). Similarly, attitudes based
on direct experience may be based on more and better information.
As a result, these attitudes may be held with greater confidence
(Fazio & Zanna 1978b). Finally, having one-sided attitude-related
information can also increase attitude confidence because univalent attitudes create less doubt than more complex ones (Jonas et
al., 1997; Prislin, Wood, & Pool, 1998).

The Present Meta-Analysis
To examine how people’s attitudes predict future behavior, we
pooled studies in which participants first received information
about a previously unknown object or issue, then reported their
attitudes toward that object or issue, and finally had the opportunity to engage in a behavior relevant to that object or issue. We
retrieved indicants of (a) the accessibility of the attitude and (b) the
stability of the attitude. In addition, we coded for (c) the amount of
thought that was likely in each condition, (d) the repeated expression of attitudes, and indicants of (e) whether participants formed
the attitude on the basis of information relevant to the behavior and
(f) whether the information available at the time of attitude formation was one- or two-sided in valence. Also, we recorded (g) the
confidence with which the attitude was held.
We then considered the effect of these moderators on the correlation between initial attitudes and future behavior (see Figure
1). In doing this, we included controls for potential confounds,
such as the publication year of the report or the time between the
attitude and behavior measures, which often affect the attitude–
behavior correlation (see, e.g., Albarracı́n, Johnson, Fishbein, &
Muellerleile, 2001; Eckes & Six, 1994).
In looking at the effects of the moderators, we were also
interested in the interactions implied in the model in Figure 1. For
instance, attitudes based on one-sided information should predict
behavior provided that individuals have the ability and motivation
to form an attitude. Thus, high and moderate ability and motivation

may ensure high attitude– behavior correspondence when the information is one-sided. However, high ability and motivation may
be necessary to ensure high attitude– behavior correspondence
when the information is double-sided. That is, forming an overall
attitude when there is conflicting information may require high
amounts of thought (see Sengupta & Johar, 2002; Tesser &
Cowan, 1977).
Figure 1 also suggests an interaction between the amount of
thought and the behavioral relevance of attitudes. People who
initially report an attitude toward a behavior may easily use this
attitude for the behavior. Similarly, individuals who report an
attitude in public may easily use this attitude for a public behavior.
Further, associating attitudes with beliefs about the outcomes of a
behavior may increase the chance of thinking of those outcomes at
the time of the behavior performance. As a consequence, behaviorally relevant attitudes should produce higher attitude– behavior
correlations. This effect, however, may only be the case when
motivation and ability are low. For example, high-thought individuals may spontaneously consider how they would behave even
if they are not asked to report it. They may also spontaneously
think about their potential private responses when they report
attitudes in public. Further, they may spontaneously associate a
behavior with a number of possible consequences (see Albarracı́n
& Wyer, 2001). Thus, a higher level of thought may ensure strong
attitude– behavior correlations even when the previously reported
attitude was not relevant to the current behavior decision (see
Ajzen & Sexton, 1999).3

Method
Bibliographic Search
We searched for empirical reports on the attitude– behavior relation
involving novel objects that were available by October 2004. We initially
searched PsycINFO, the Communication and Mass Media Complete Database, the Sociological Collection Database, the Social Science Citation
Index, and Dissertation Abstracts International using the keywords attitude
formation, attitude and behavior, attitude change, persuasive message,
persuasion and behavior, behavior prediction, intention and behavior, and
nonattitudes. We also checked the reference lists of the meta-analyses and
reviews of the attitude– behavior relation available by 2004 (e.g., Armitage
& Conner, 2001; Cooke & Sheeran, 2004; Kim & Hunter, 1993; Kraus,
1995; Notani, 1998; Ryan & Bonfield, 1975; Sheppard et al., 1988; Van
den Putte, 1993) and reviewed a systematic collection of 530 empirical
manuscripts on the attitude– behavior relation that Dolores Albarracı́n

Because we assume that any variation in the valence of the information
associated with the attitude may affect attitude stability, one-sidedness (vs.
two-sidedness) of information refers to manipulations that can increase the
consistency (vs. inconsistency) of the attitude with beliefs, affect, or
behavior as well as the consistency (vs. inconsistency) of different beliefs,
different affective reactions, or different behaviors (within-component
consistency).

Note that amount of thought could also interact with attitude accessibility or attitude confidence. For example, Fazio (1990) suggested that
chronically accessible attitudes can predict behavior when motivation and
cognitive capacity are low. The degree to which the attitudes are automatically retrieved from memory, however, may not matter when motivation
and ability are high. However, this does not apply to our review because
participants are unlikely to have previous accessible or confident attitudes
toward novel objects.

<-----Page 5----->ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION
possesses. Once we identified the scope and type of studies available for
inclusion, we further searched databases for combinations of keywords,
including reflection and behavior, argument and behavior, motivation and
behavior, ability and behavior, accessibility and behavior, stability and
behavior, confidence and behavior, involvement and behavior, elaboration
likelihood model and behavior, heuristic systematic model and behavior,
and risk perceptions and behavior. We also retrieved citations of studies
involving well-known behavior research paradigms using the keywords
puzzles and attitudes, essay and attitudes, exams and attitudes, petition and
attitudes, prisoner’s dilemma and attitudes, and candidate and attitudes. To
further our search for new social objects or behaviors, we combined the
keywords new, novel, fictitious, and unknown with the keywords candidate, screening, behavior, method, risk, policy, product, issue, technology,
hazard, and group, always allowing for up to three words between the
keywords. This procedure allowed us to identify citations relevant to issues
such as new cancer screening and new sexually transmitted disease screening. Finally, we retrieved citations related to the attitude– behavior relation
from the Internet-based conference proceedings database of the Association of Consumer Research and searched three other Internet-based databases to locate theses and dissertations from universities outside of the
United States (i.e., the Index to Theses, the Foreign Doctoral Dissertations
Database of the Center for Research Libraries, and the database of the
Institute for Psychology Information in Germany). Although calculating
the precise number of citations obtained from this search is difficult, the
total number of citations retrieved from electronic databases exceeded
25,000, without consideration of overlap.
To further ensure that our literature search procedures were thorough, we
manually examined the reference lists of the studies we encountered during
the process. We also manually checked the indexes of the most relevant
publications in the area, including Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, and Journal of Consumer Research, since
the year 1995, when Kraus’s (1995) attitude– behavior meta-analysis was
published. Finally, we sent a request for unpublished reports to the e-mail
lists for the Society of Personality and Social Psychology and the Association for Consumer Research in two instances at two points in time and
contacted authors of reports that were missing attitude– behavior correlations and that met our inclusion criteria and were published after 1990.

Inclusion Criteria
We were interested in attitude formation rather than attitude change.
Thus, we selected studies involving attitude– behavior correlations that
presented participants with unknown objects or issues. For instance, we
included studies that presented puzzles or unfamiliar commercial products
in experimental settings (see Regan & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2; Sengupta & Fitzsimons, 2000). Further, we selected studies that inquired about
new issues (e.g., the institution of a parking fee at the university; Leippe &
Elkin, 1987) and studies of behaviors regarding new issues (e.g., voting in
favor of or against the institution of comprehensive exams; Albarracı́n &
Wyer, 2000). Correspondingly, we excluded research on attitudes about
highly familiar objects. These involved health-related behaviors (e.g.,
Turner et al., 1994), (real) political candidates (e.g., Cacioppo et al., 1986;
Fazio & Williams, 1986), familiar commercial products (e.g., Fazio et al.,
1989; Kokkinaki & Lundt, 1997), religion (Zanna, Olson, & Fazio, 1981),
and (real) social groups (e.g., Blessum, Lord, & Sia, 1998).
To ensure that participants formed an attitude rather than entirely deducing an attitude from previous ones (Prislin et al., 1998), we excluded
surveys and control conditions. These types of studies do not present
information on which to base an attitude or provide opportunities to acquire
direct experience with the object (e.g., Sivacek & Crano, 1982, Study 1).
In addition, we included studies only if they incorporated a measure of
attitudes and an observation of overt behavior. Studies that measured
intentions (e.g., intentions to try a new detergent; Lutz, 1977; whether

783

participants were willing to recommend one product instead of another;
Miniard & Cohen, 1983) were excluded. Finally, we excluded studies in
which researchers elicited the relevant behavior before the attitude (e.g.,
second measure of attitudes; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1974; Wilson et al., 1984,
Experiment 2) because these studies did not allow for causal inferences
about the influence of attitudes. Of the studies that did meet our inclusion
criteria, some were excluded because they lacked an attitude measure (e.g.,
Berning & Jacoby, 1974; Chaiken, 1979; Wilson & Schooler, 1991) or did
not report the attitude– behavior correlation (e.g., Songer-Nocks, 1976).
The search for studies resulted in 29 research reports. This set represents
a smaller and more specific literature than the ones synthesized in previous
attitude– behavior meta-analyses addressing influences of accessibility and
stability (i.e., Cooke & Sheeran, 2004; Kraus, 1995). However, our database excluded unknown past experiences with the attitude object. Thus, we
were able to infer the factors associated with accessibility and stability
from the context of the attitude formation. Further, this was possible even
when researchers did not report or manipulate those factors. Consequently,
despite the use of conservative inclusion criteria, the number of conditions
available for each moderator in our data set greatly exceeded those in
previous studies.
The 29 research reports included in the meta-analysis involved 41
studies and 128 study conditions. Of those conditions, 109 were statistically independent, whereas 19 were based on longitudinal measures completed by the same group of participants. These longitudinal measures
allowed us to assess the longitudinal stability of attitudes. However,
because the inclusion of the longitudinal reports violates statistical independence assumptions, we presently report results that both include and
exclude the dependent conditions.

Study Variables
Two investigators independently coded the studies. Disagreements were
resolved by discussion and consultation with experts. Kappa coefficients
for each variable ranged from .79 (91% of agreement) to 1.00 (100%
agreement). Perfect agreement was obtained in 14 (out of 17) coded
variables.
The variables we recorded included the attitude– behavior correlations in
each study condition and the potential moderators of that correlation (see
Figure 1). Some of the moderators of interest could be found directly
within the study reports (e.g., response latencies in each condition and
repeated report of attitudes). Other moderators were more inferential (e.g.,
outcome and value relevance). Study moderators included (a) the accessibility of attitudes, as indicated by the reverse of response latencies; (b) the
stability of attitudes at two points in time; (c) the likely amount of thought;
(d) the repeated expression of attitudes; (e) the behavioral relevance of the
initial attitude; (f) the association of the initial attitude with one-sided
information; and (g) the confidence with which the attitude was held. We
also coded for (h) potential confounds to control for differences in the
study reports included in the meta-analysis.
Attitude– behavior correlations. We retrieved correlations from each
study condition included in the meta-analysis. Attitudes were generally
measured by semantic differential scales with anchors such as very good
versus very bad (Berger & Mitchell, 1989), something that I like versus
something I don’t like (Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2001), or pleasant versus
unpleasant (e.g., Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003). Measures of overt behaviors included, for example, the number of times participants worked on
each of several types of puzzles (e.g., Regan & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2)
or whether participants voted in favor of or against the institution of
comprehensive exams in a lab poll (e.g., Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2000, 2001).
Attitude accessibility. Whenever possible, we retrieved the mean response time (latency) to report attitudes in seconds. Response latencies
were assigned a negative sign and used as a measure of attitude accessibility in analyses (see Table 1).

Attitude change comprises the difference between mean attitudes at two points, divided by the standard deviation of the initial attitude.
b
Correlations were computed between attitudes and message-based beliefs about behavior outcomes (weighted by the desirability of the outcomes) when
participants received a persuasive message or answered questions about beliefs that they were unlikely to generate spontaneously and between attitudes and
beliefs of behavior outcomes (weighted by the desirability of the outcomes) elicited from a similar population when participants received behavior feedback
and were not induced to think about new information by answering questions (see Albarracín & Wyer, 2000, 2001).

When experimenters introduced a break between measures during the same session, time was coded as 0.01 days, representing an average of 15 min
between the attitude report and the behavior performance.
Behavior feedback is a manipulation that consists of presenting participants with bogus feedback that they unconsciously voted in favor of or against a
policy (Albarracín & Wyer, 2000).

Involves average response latencies for attitudes, intentions, and perceived behavioral control.

GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

Attitude stability. We used absolute standardized differences between
the initial and later measures of attitude to represent attitude stability.
Specifically, we obtained Becker’s g in each condition by subtracting the
later attitude report from the initial attitude report and dividing the resulting
figure by the standard deviation of the first attitude report. Then we
removed the sign of the difference to represent absolute attitude change
(e.g., Albarracı́n & McNatt, 2002). At the end, we reversed the sign of this
variable in analyses to indicate the influence of attitude stability instead of
change.
Indicants of amount of thought. We recorded the participants’ motivation and ability to think about the object or issue at the time of the
attitude formation. Motivation included the levels of (a) outcome relevance, (b) value relevance, and (c) need for cognition (Cacioppo &
Petty, 1982) in each particular sample. Outcome relevance involved the
pertinence of the attitude issue to the participants’ current goals and was
classified as low, moderate, or high. When the issue had no consequences for participants’ current goals (e.g., participants played with
puzzles or with video games for recreational purposes; Doll & Ajzen,
1992; Millar & Tesser, 1989; participants were told that they would not
be affected by the introduction of a new policy; Albarracı́n & Kumkale,
2003), outcome relevance was coded as low. When the issue (e.g.,
policy) could have consequences for participants’ goals but it was not
clear how participants might be affected (e.g., there was a policy to be
introduced, but participants did not know when or whether they would
partake in the decision process; Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2001), we coded
outcome relevance as moderate. When the issue was directly relevant
for the participants’ goals (e.g., solving puzzles to practice for a test;
Millar & Tesser, 1986; acquisition of one product instead of another;
Berger & Mitchell, 1989; having the opportunity to influence decision
makers with regard to a policy related to one’s political stance; G. L.
Cohen, 2003; voting on a referendum to decide on the institution of a
policy that will affect oneself; Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003), we coded
outcome relevance as high.4,5
Value relevance was coded as high or low depending on the implications
of the attitude issue to people’s values. For example, we coded value
relevance as low when researchers presented participants with irrelevant
issues, such as puzzles (Fazio & Zanna, 1978b) or video games (Doll &
Ajzen, 1992). In turn, we coded value relevance as high when the research
concerned issues more likely to be salient to participants’ enduring values
(e.g., a social program to help poor families; G. L. Cohen, 2003; the
institution of comprehensive exams at the university; Albarracı́n & Wyer,
2001).6 Finally, we coded need for cognition as high and low when
researchers divided separate groups according to a median split or similar
procedure (e.g., H. M. Wallace, 2003) and as mixed when researchers did
not split the study samples on the basis of need for cognition.
Ability comprised (a) concentration and (b) information repetition. We
coded conditions as low in concentration when participants were distracted
while they received the attitude-relevant information (e.g., a high-volume
conversation was played at the time of the message reception; Albarracı́n
& Kumkale, 2003). Correspondingly, conditions were high in concentration (i.e., low in distraction) when either the environment was silent (e.g.,
Leippe & Elkin, 1987) or only low-volume, content-free background noise
was presented in a laboratory setting (e.g., Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003).
We coded information repetition as low or high depending on whether the
researchers presented the information once or multiple times, respectively
(e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989; see Kumkale & Albarracı́n, 2004, for
similar procedures).
Repeated expression or report of attitudes. We recorded the number of
times participants reported their attitudes before they engaged in the
relevant behavior. In most of the conditions, participants reported their
attitudes only once. In the remaining conditions, researchers explicitly
manipulated the number of attitude expressions in a single session (e.g.,
Fazio et al., 1982, Experiment 4) or measured the participants’ attitudes at
various points of time (e.g., H. M. Wallace, 2003).

Direct behavioral experience. We recorded whether participants in
each group had direct experience with the object. Typical manipulations of
direct behavioral experience involved playing with (novel) puzzles (Regan
& Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2) or trying (previously unknown) products
(e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989) before measures of attitudes and behaviors
were obtained.
Behavioral relevance of initial attitudes. We coded conditions with
respect to behavioral relevance by assessing (a) the use of measures of
attitudes toward specific behaviors and (b) the strength of the association
of the initial attitudes with cognitions about behavior outcomes. We also
classified conditions in terms of the (c) public–private and (d) hedonic–
instrumental correspondence between the initial attitude and the overt
behavior.
We recorded whether participants reported attitudes toward behaviors
(e.g., voting for the institution of comprehensive exams at the university;
Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2000) or targets (e.g., the institution of comprehensive
exams at the university; Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003). In addition, when
possible, we retrieved the correlation between cognitions of behavioral
outcomes and attitudes. Measures of cognitions of behavioral outcomes
consisted of the sum or average of the perceived likelihood of each
behavior outcome weighted by the desirability of each event (e.g., participants reported on a 10-point scale whether they believed that voting in
favor of the institution of comprehensive examinations at the university
would result in a salary increase for the university graduates and then
evaluated that possibility along a scale from ⫺5 to 5; Albarracı́n & Wyer,
2001).
To register the effect of public–private correspondence, we first recorded
whether participants reported their attitudes in public or in private. We also
recorded whether the actual behavior was public or private. Low public–
private correspondence comprised conditions in which participants first
reported their attitudes in a private way but then performed a behavior that
others could observe and judge (e.g., participants wrote and signed an
editorial in favor of or against a new social policy; G. L. Cohen, 2003;
participants were asked to demonstrate their video game playing skills to
others; Doll & Ajzen, 1992). It also comprised conditions in which participants reported an attitude in public but later performed a behavior
without witnesses (e.g., participants initially believed that they would

4
High outcome relevance excluded conditions in which the main goal
was to undergo public scrutiny (e.g., discuss one’s attitudes; Albarracı́n &
Wyer, 2000; demonstrate one’s video game playing skills; Doll & Ajzen,
1992; see Lieppe & Elkin, 1987).
5
We coded outcome relevance on the basis of the instructions participants received before they reported their attitudes. Thus, when participants
received instructions to choose a product (e.g., Sengupta & Fitzimons,
2000) or use a series of puzzles to practice for an analytical test (Millar &
Millar, 1996) after they reported their attitudes, we coded outcome relevance as low regardless of those instructions. In one study (i.e., Sivacek &
Crano, 1982), however, outcome relevance was coded on the basis of
participants’ reported involvement (i.e., participants indicated the extent to
which they felt that the institution of comprehensive exams at the university would affect them) rather than on actual manipulations.
6
According to this coding scheme, a condition can be high in outcome
relevance and low in value relevance or vice versa. For example, participants can evaluate different brands of candy (low value relevance) to select
one brand of candy (high outcome relevance; Berger & Mitchell, 1989).
Conversely, the institution of comprehensive exams at the university (high
value relevance) may not affect the goals of the participants who evaluate
those exams if the policy is to be implemented for future students and they
do not expect to partake in the decision process when they form an attitude
(low outcome relevance; Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003).

<-----Page 27----->ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION
discuss their attitudes with a researcher at a later time, but they performed
the attitude-relevant behavior in private; Alleman, 1998; Leippe & Elkin,
1987). Moderate public–private correspondence included conditions in
which participants explained the reasons for their attitudes. This manipulation may elicit reports that are socially acceptable even when the actual
report is private (e.g., reason-analysis conditions; Millar & Tesser, 1986).
Finally, high public–private correspondence involved conditions in which
the attitude and the behavior were measured in similarly private or public
ways.
In addition, we recorded the hedonic–instrumental correspondence of
participants’ focus at the time they formed an attitude and the type of
behavior they later performed. In particular, the high level of hedonic–
instrumental correspondence comprised conditions in which participants concentrated on their feelings about an object and later performed
a hedonic behavior (e.g., participants focused on how they felt about a
series of puzzles and later played with those puzzles; Millar & Tesser,
1986). In addition, it comprised conditions in which participants focused on reasons in support for their evaluations of the object and later
performed an instrumental behavior (e.g., participants reported the
reasons for their attitudes toward a series of puzzles and later used those
puzzles to practice for a test of analytical ability; Millar & Tesser, 1986;
participants received arguments supporting comprehensive exams and
later wrote an essay to communicate their opinion about the exams to
the university administration; Leippe & Elkin, 1987). We coded conditions in which participants possessed affective and instrumental information (e.g., researchers induced positive or negative mood and also
presented a persuasive communication about the outcomes of instituting
comprehensive exams at the university; Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003)
as well as conditions in which participants were not specifically induced
to focus on cognitions or affect (e.g., participants had direct experience
with analytical puzzles; Regan & Fazio, 1977) as moderate in hedonic–
instrumental correspondence regardless of the type of behavior they
performed later. This coding was based on the assumption that either
the relevant or the nonrelevant bases might be available at the time of
the behavior. Finally, we considered hedonic–instrumental correspondence as low when participants initially had an affective focus and later
performed an instrumental behavior (e.g., participants initially reported
their feelings about a puzzle but later practiced for an analytical test;
Millar & Tesser, 1986) or initially had a cognitive focus and later
performed a hedonic behavior (e.g., participants first reported the
reasons for their attitudes toward several puzzles but later played with
those puzzles; Millar & Tesser, 1986).7
Information one-sidedness. To indicate one-sidedness, we first coded for
(a) the reception of one-sided information and (b) the absence of an induction
of nonspontaneous two-sided thoughts about the attitude object. We coded
conditions that presented participants with either positive or negative affect
(e.g., Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003), either propolicy or antipolicy persuasive
messages (e.g., Leippe & Elkin, 1987), either favorable or unfavorable information (e.g., Berger, 1999; Sengupta & Fitzsimons, 2000), and either positive
or negative bogus behavioral feedback (e.g., Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2000) as
involving the reception of one-sided information. In contrast, we coded conditions in which participants received two-sided messages (e.g., H. M. Wallace, 2003) or were allowed to interact freely with the attitudinal object (i.e.,
direct and indirect experience; Regan & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2) as presenting two-sided information.8,9
We also recorded whether the researcher induced participants to
consider two-sided information about the topic that was unlikely to
emerge spontaneously. This coding considered the introduction of questions measuring outcome beliefs and evaluations about the outcomes of
a behavior, which were often used in research by Albarracı́n and
Kumkale (2003; Albarracı́n & McNatt, 2002). In this work, the researchers first presented (one-sided) positive or negative information
about comprehensive exams (e.g., a mood or a persuasive message).
They later measured cognitions about both negative and positive out-

805

comes of the exams (for a validation of these procedures, see Albarracı́n, 2002). It is important to note that participants in this population
tended to spontaneously think about negative outcomes of comprehensive exams (for a detailed report of the elicitation procedures that
established this, see Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2001). Hence, questions about
negative outcomes should not force thoughts about two-sided information even when participants initially received positive information.
However, questions about positive outcomes can induce nonspontaneous thoughts when participants initially receive negative information.
Therefore, we coded conditions in which participants answered questions about positive outcomes after receiving negative information as
induction of nonspontaneous two-sided thoughts (e.g., Albarracı́n &
Kumkale, 2003, Experiment 2). In addition, we coded conditions in
which some participants received negative information and others received positive information but all answered questions about positive
outcomes (e.g., Albarracı́n & McNatt, 2002, Experiment 1, Conditions
10, 11, and 12; see Table 1) as sometimes receiving nonspontaneous
two-sided thoughts. All other conditions were coded as not inducing
nonspontaneous two-sided thoughts.
Confidence. When possible, we recorded the level of attitude confidence participants reported in each condition. Items to measure confidence
included “How confident are you in each of the ratings you have just
made?” (Fazio & Zanna, 1978b, p. 232) and “I am sure about my attitude
about the institution of comprehensive exams” (H. M. Wallace, 2003).
Because there were differences in the scales of confidence measures across
studies, we converted the confidence means to proportions. We did this by
first calculating the position of the mean confidence in a study condition
relative to the lowest value of the scale and then dividing this value by the
number of positions of the scale (see Albarracı́n et al., 2003, for the use of this
procedure). Thus, a mean confidence of 6.13 on a scale from 1 to 7 (Berger &
Mitchell, 1989) resulted in a scale-free mean confidence of 0.73.

7
In some conditions (e.g., R.W. Johnson, McArthur, & Wright, 1991;
Sengupta & Fitzimons, 2000), participants focused on their cognitions after
they first received the information that provided the basis for their attitudes.
However, these participants were likely to form their attitudes on the basis
of information they originally received rather than the information that was
the focus of their introspection later on. Therefore, we did not consider this
manipulation when coding for the consistency of the focus at the time of
the attitude and the time of the behavior (see R. W. Johnson et al., 1991).
8
As suggested by Ha and Hoch (1989) and by Reed et al. (2002), experience might provide ambiguous information when objects are not clearly
distinguishable from similar objects, are evaluated on the basis of irrelevant
dimensions, or do not present specific positive or negative information. The
objects with which participants had direct or indirect experience were not
selected to be positive or negative on the basis of pilot data. Thus, we assumed
that interacting freely with them would provide mixed information about their
favorableness. The only exception was Berger and Mitchell’s (1989) indirect
experience conditions, which were coded as one-sided. In these conditions,
researchers first asked a sample of participants from the target population to
taste five brands of candy bars (participants were told that the candy bars had
been successfully marketed in other countries) and to describe their experience. Next, the researchers designed experimental ads by combining that
information with commercials previously used to promote the candy bars. It is
very likely that these procedures undermined negative aspects of the candy
bars and emphasized positive ones.
9
Conditions in which participants were induced to experience positive
affect before the presentation of antipolicy arguments as well as conditions
in which participants were induced to experience negative affect before the
presentation of propolicy arguments (i.e., Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003;
Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2001) were coded as one-sided because positive affect
induces a bias in favor of the advocacy regardless of whether the advocacy
is pro- or counterattitudinal (see Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003).

<-----Page 28----->806

GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

Other moderators. To observe the effect of time on the attitude– behavior
relation, we first recorded whether researchers introduced a time gap between
the attitude and the behavior measures. We next operationalized the time gap
as the number of days elapsed between the two measures. Thus, a 30-min gap
was coded 0.02, and a 5-day gap was coded 5.00.
In addition, we recorded the type of research paradigm used in each
study. This potential confound was represented by two variables. One
variable indicated whether researchers used the puzzle research paradigm
(e.g., participants had direct or indirect experience with a series of analytical puzzles followed by a free-play period; e.g., Millar & Millar, 1996,
Experiments 2 and 3). The other indicated whether researchers used the
comprehensive exams research topic (e.g., researchers presented arguments
in favor of or against the institution of comprehensive exams at the
university and then asked participants to vote in favor of or against the
institution of the exams; Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003). Finally, we recorded whether each report was published and the year of publication or
write-up of the report.

Data Analysis
We used fixed- and random-effects procedures to calculate weightedmean attitude– behavior correlations and to conduct moderator analyses.
The fixed-effects procedures assume that a single or few well-demarked
effects underlie the effects sizes synthesized in a meta-analysis. The
random-effects procedures, in contrast, assume a random population of
effect sizes from which the effect sizes in a meta-analysis are drawn. Thus,
in the fixed-effects models the variance of an effect size depends on the
error of the particular study. In turn, in the random-effects models the
variance includes the error of the particular study plus the variance of the
sample of effect sizes as an estimate of the population variance. For these
reasons, the random-effects approach allows for generalization to a broader
universe of studies and is more appropriate when there is heterogeneity in
the database under study. However, it can be excessively conservative and
thus increase Type II error (see Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hedges & Vevea,
1998; but see Hunter & Schmidt, 2000).
In the fixed-effects models we calculated the weighted average correlations following the recommendations of Hedges and Olkin (1985). In these
procedures, traditional correlation coefficients are transformed into z coefficients and weighted by N ⫺ 3. For interpretation purposes, the resulting
weighted-mean z values are converted back to r using Fisher’s z-to-r
transformations. The random-effects models were calculated according to
the recommendations of Lipsey and Wilson (2001).
We initially estimated the weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlation and
the corresponding homogeneity test (Q). Then, we performed between-units
moderator analyses. For this purpose, we first used the aforementioned procedures to calculate the weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlation and
confidence intervals (CIs) for each moderator level. Second, we conducted
weighted-least-squares simple regressions and corrected the standard errors
following procedures recommended by Hedges and Olkin (1985).
It is important to note that we used two strategies to avoid violations of
statistical independence in these analyses. First, we simply eliminated the
statistically dependent within-subject measures in longitudinal reports.
Second, we used the shifting unit of analysis approach (Cooper, 1998). This
approach entails decomposing conditions in studies showing variability in
the moderator and clustering conditions in studies not showing variability
in the moderator. For example, Albarracı́n and Wyer (2000, Experiment 1)
induced two levels of concentration but one level of outcome relevance.
Leippe and Elkin (1987) induced two levels of outcome relevance but only
one level of concentration. Thus, Albarracı́n and Wyer’s (2000, Experiment 1) study contributed two effect sizes for the analysis of ability and
one for the analysis of outcome relevance. Leippe and Elkin’s (1987) report
contributed one effect size for the analysis of ability and two for the
analysis of outcome relevance. (See Table 1 for a description of the
manipulated conditions in those studies.) Weighted multiple regression

analyses were performed excluding and including the conditions that
involved reports by the same participants.
We also conducted within-unit moderator analyses to estimate the effect of
the variables of interest while controlling for differences between units. For
this purpose, we first estimated the simple correlation between a given moderator and the attitude– behavior correlation using the different conditions of
each report.10 These correlations could only be computed when a report had
three or more conditions (e.g., two direct experience conditions and two
no-experience conditions; Millar & Millar, 1996, Experiments 3 and 4; two
high and one low public–private correspondence condition; Wilson & Dunn,
1986). We next transformed individual correlations to z coefficients and
weighted them by the number of participants included in each report minus 3
to obtain an estimate of the effect of the moderator across all reports. Finally,
we transformed the resulting z coefficient back to Pearson correlations. We
used z tests to estimate whether these correlations were different from zero,
using the total number of participants in the synthesized reports as the sample
size for the analysis. We conducted these procedures using fixed-effects
approaches.11
Finally, we performed mediation analyses using EQS (Structural Equations Modeling Software; Bentler & Wu, 1995). For these analyses we used
maximum likelihood estimation methods and set the sample size of the
overall analyses at the level of the minimum sample size in the correlation
matrix. We corrected the standard error of the resulting coefficients using
Hedges and Olkin’s (1985) methods.

the fixed-effects approach and .51 (95% CI ⫽ .48, .54) according to the random-effects approach. However, there appeared to
10

We used reports rather than studies for these analyses to maximize the
number of units integrating the minimum three conditions necessary to calculate Pearson correlations. Thus, for example, when a report described two
studies involving two and four conditions, respectively, we estimated correlations between moderators and the attitude– behavior relation by pooling all six
conditions (see, e.g., Fazio & Zanna, 1978b, Experiments 1 and 2).
11
An advantage of these analyses is that we can estimate moderating effects
even for reports that did not provide the statistics to calculate the precise effects
of the moderators. These analyses, however, ignore reports with k ⬍ 3. Thus,
when possible, we estimated the exact differences between attitude– behavior
correlations to supplement these analyses. We converted these to correlations.
For example, Wilson and Dunn (1986, Experiment 2) reported ts ⫽ 2.51 and
2.60 for three conditions representing two levels of behavior relevance. These
t tests (Ns ⫽ 96 and 95, respectively) resulted in ds ⫽ 0.51 and 0.54 and rs ⫽
.25 and .26. We averaged these rs to obtain an estimate of the impact of the
behavioral relevance in this study. In other studies, we could calculate rs by
regressing the behavior on the moderator, the attitude measure, and the
interaction between the two and then dividing the resulting unstandardized
regression coefficient for the interaction term by the corresponding standard
deviation (see J. Cohen, 1977). With this method we estimated, for example,
an effect for outcome relevance of r ⫽ .16 from B ⫽ 0.08 and SD ⫽ 0.52
(Albarracı́n & Kumkale, 2003, Experiment 2). The rs obtained were weighted
by the number of participants in each study minus 3 and combined into a single
weighted correlation for each moderator. The units in these analyses were

.001.
Given the difficulty of studying attitude formation in realworld situations, most of the studies we selected were carried
out in the laboratory with college students. Only one of the
studies (Regan & Fazio, 1977, Study 1) examined attitude
formation in the field. Researchers measured the behavior immediately after measuring attitudes in 44% of the cases and
introduced a gap of between approximately 15 min and 2 weeks
in the remaining cases. Fifty-one percent of the study conditions
presented participants with relatively irrelevant objects, such as
puzzles (e.g., Regan & Fazio, 1977, Experiment 2; Wilson et
al., 1984, Experiment 1) or videos (e.g., Doll & Mallü, 1990).
The rest used more important issues, such as the institution of
comprehensive exams at the participants’ university (i.e., Albarracı́n & Wyer, 2001). Outcome relevance was low, moderate, and high in 44%, 35%, and 21% of the conditions, respectively. Most of the samples (84%) were composed of
participants of mixed levels of need for cognition. Participants
were relatively distracted when receiving the information about
the attitude object in 7% of the conditions and received the
information about the topic more than once in 6% of the cases
integrated in this meta-analysis.
Participants reported their attitudes once in 83% of the study
conditions, obtained direct behavioral experience with the object in
31% of the cases, and reported attitudes toward behaviors in 35%
of the conditions in this review. Public–private correspondence
was high in 77% of the cases, moderate in 13% of the cases, and
low in 9% of the cases. Hedonic–instrumental correspondence was
high in 34% of the cases, moderate in 56% of the cases, and low
in 9% of the cases. Forty-six percent of the conditions included
two-sided information about the issue being studied, and 8%
entailed consideration of two-sided information by means of questions about the pros of an issue that participants were unlikely to
consider spontaneously. Thirty-one percent of the conditions used
puzzles, and 46% included comprehensive exams as the main
study topic. Table 1 describes the studies and conditions included
in the meta-analysis in relation to the theoretical variables of
interest.

Between-Units Moderating Effects
Simple analyses. We analyzed the influence of individual
moderators on the attitude– behavior relation. For this purpose,
we first calculated the weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlation and CIs for each level of the moderators. We used the
shifting unit of analysis procedures for these analyses because
they collapse across levels of the moderators not examined in
each analysis (see the Data Analysis section for a detailed
explanation of these procedures). When moderators were categorical (e.g., outcome relevance), we simply calculated the
mean-weighted attitude– behavior correlation for each level of
the moderator (e.g., high, moderate, and low outcome relevance) across all studies. When moderators were continuous
(e.g., stability), we first estimated the mean of the moderator for
all conditions in each study that reported measures of the
moderator. We then classified the studies into high and low
levels of the moderator using median splits. Finally, we esti-

807

mated weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlations for each
of those levels.
Second, to obtain comparable estimates of the moderators’
effects, we regressed the attitude– behavior correlation on each
relevant moderator. We conducted these regressions using
random- and fixed-effects procedures and three different samples of conditions: (a) shifting unit of analyses conditions, (b)
statistically independent conditions, and (c) all conditions. The
weights for fixed-effects models followed Hedges and Olkin’s
(1985) computational formulas. The weights for random-effects
models followed Lipsey and Wilson’s (2001) formulas.
The results from these analyses using the fixed-effects approach appear in Table 2. The 4th and 5th columns of the table
show the weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlations and CIs
for the different levels of the moderators. The 6th, 8th, and 11th
columns summarize the corresponding simple weighted regression coefficients. As expected, the attitude– behavior correlation was positively associated with attitude stability, high levels
of outcome and value relevance, the repeated expression or
report of attitudes, the behavioral relevance of attitudes, and the
one-sidedness of information participants received or thought
about. However, accessibility, ability, direct behavioral experience, and attitude confidence did not show the expected associations with the attitude– behavior correlation. The effects of
accessibility, information repetition, and attitude confidence
did not reach significance. Direct behavioral experience and
concentration were negatively associated with the attitude–
behavior correlation. Of note, these results were comparable
when we excluded the longitudinal dependent conditions and
when we used the shifting of analyses conditions. In addition,
these fixed effects were very similar to the random effects that
we also examined. Except for concentration, absence of questions about two-sided thoughts, and direct experience, the moderators that were significant in the fixed-effects analyses were
at least marginally significant in the random-effects analyses
( p ⬍ .08). Further, the effects from the two approaches were in
the same direction and similar in size, according to J. Cohen’s
(1977) criteria, in all cases.
The findings in Table 2 also shed light on the impact of
methodological issues that can affect the attitude– behavior
association. As one can see, the attitude– behavior correlation
did not vary as a function of the time elapsed between the
measure of the attitude and the measure of the behavior. The
puzzles research paradigm elicited lower attitude– behavior correlations. The comprehensive-exam topic elicited higher
attitude– behavior correlations. Contrary to the possibility that
published studies yield stronger effects than unpublished ones,
the simple regression analysis revealed greater effects for unpublished studies. Further, more recent reports elicited higher
attitude– behavior correlations than older ones.
Multiple regressions. Next, we observed the effect of the
moderators on the attitude– behavior relation, controlling for intercorrelations among moderators. For this purpose, we regressed the
attitude– behavior correlation simultaneously on all moderators.
These regressions excluded moderators with ks smaller than 128 to
maximize statistical power. For the moderators with ks smaller
than 128, we conducted separate multiple regressions, controlling
for the potential confounds that showed variability in the data sets

that reported measures of those moderators.12 We performed all
these analyses using random-effects and fixed-effects procedures,
including and excluding the statistically dependent longitudinal
conditions.
The 9th and 12th columns of Table 2 summarize the results
of the multiple regressions using the fixed-effects approach. As
hypothesized, correlations between attitudes and behaviors
were stronger when the motivation to think about the issue or
object under study was higher. Correlations were also stronger
when participants reported attitudes toward the behavior and

public–private and hedonic–instrumental correspondence
were high. Further, attitudes predicted behavior to a greater
extent when there was no reception or induction of two-sided
considerations. It is important to note that controlling for all the

other moderators rendered the effect of direct experience
positive.13,14
As was the case with the simple regressions, the multiple regressions were very robust. First, the multiple regressions using
the random-effects and fixed-effects procedures yielded comparable results. That is, they replicated in size and direction in all cases.
Further, aside form the hedonic–instrumental correspondence, the
moderators that were significant in the fixed-effects models were
also significant or marginally significant in the random-effects
models ( p ⬍ .10). Second, the findings were also comparable
when we excluded the statistically dependent longitudinal conditions. Third, results also replicated when the multiple regression
included composite measures of motivation, behavioral relevance,
and one-sidedness (which we created by standardizing and averaging each relevant set of predictors; see bottom section of Table
2).15 Finally, with regard to the potential confounds, the multiple
regression analysis controlled for intercorrelations among the predictors and rendered the effect of the research paradigm nonsignificant. This latter finding demonstrates that the effect of the
paradigms used by different researchers disappears after one takes
into account the theoretical moderators of interest (see Figure 1).

Within-Unit Moderating Effects
Next, we performed within-unit moderator analyses. In these
analyses, we first obtained the Pearson correlations between the
attitude– behavior correlation and the moderators that varied
within each report (k ⱖ 3). We then combined the correlations
using the fixed-effects procedures previously used to estimate the
weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlation. As in the betweenunits analyses, the within-unit analyses showed that the attitude–
behavior relation was positively associated with attitude stability
(r. ⫽ .66, p ⬍ .001), outcome relevance (r. ⫽ .48, p ⬍ .001),
repeated expression of attitudes (r. ⫽ .24, p ⬍ .001), the correlation between attitudes and beliefs about behavior outcomes (r. ⫽
.50, p ⬍ .001), public–private and hedonic–instrumental correspondence (r.s ⫽ .57 and .81, both ps ⬍ .001), the one-sided
nature of the information participants received (r. ⫽ .12, p ⬍ .05),
and the absence of two-sided questions (r. ⫽ .72, p ⬍ .001).
Moreover, as in the between-units multiple regression analyses,
direct experience was associated with higher attitude– behavior
correlations (r. ⫽ .83, p ⬍ .001), and concentration did not reach
significance ( p ⬍ .5). However, in contrast to the between-units
analyses, the associations of the attitude– behavior relation with
attitude accessibility, information repetition, and confidence were
significant (i.e., r.s ⫽ .40, .56, and .44, respectively, all ps ⬍ .001).
Further, the time between the attitude and behavior measures had
a marginally significant association in the set of studies integrated
in the within-unit analyses (r. ⫽ ⫺.09, p ⬍ .08).16 These differences in the results are not surprising because within-unit analyses
provide better control for methodological discrepancies across
studies. These controls appear to be especially critical for the
measures of response latencies (see Table 1 for the large betweenreports differences in accessibility measures). Other than that, both
sets of procedures yielded remarkably consistent results.17

Test of Interactions Between Moderators
Between- and within-unit analyses showed that a number of
moderators were linked to attitude– behavior correspondence.

However, the relation of those moderators with the attitude–
behavior correlation may not be simple. For example, past research
has suggested that ambivalent attitudes may influence the attitude–
behavior relation differently depending on people’s motivation to
detect and resolve the conflicting views implied in those attitudes
(Albarracı́n, 2002; Albarracı́n et al., 2004; Sengupta & Johar,
2002). Similarly, people with a high amount of thought at the time
of the attitude formation may be able to consider behavioral
information (Ajzen, 1996). This possibility may be true even if the
study does not elicit attitudes toward the behavior, because people
may spontaneously evaluate the behavior. It may be true also when
the context of the attitude and behavior measure do not match.
That is, even when people report their behavior in public, they may
still think about their likely response in private. Finally, even when
attitudes have low correlations with beliefs about behavior outcomes, people may think about other behavioral issues if they have
a chance. In short, the behavioral relevance of the attitude as
captured in Figure 1 may not matter when amount of thought is
high.
We thus conducted weighted multiple regression analysis to
determine whether the information one-sidedness and the behavioral relevance of attitudes influenced the attitude– behavior correlation in combination with amount of thought. Of the indicants of
amount of thought, we selected motivation, as opposed to ability.
The reason was that ability was not associated with the attitude–
behavior relation in the multivariate regressions (see Table 2).

13
To observe whether the initial inverse effect of direct experience was
related to the use of irrelevant issues (e.g., puzzles), we used two procedures. First, we conducted a weighted hierarchical regression analysis by
first introducing the value relevance of the attitude issue together with the
potential confounds. We then added the indicators of information onesidedness and behavioral relevance of the initial attitude. Only when we
controlled for the information one-sidedness and behavior relevance did
direct experience become positively associated with the attitude– behavior
correlation. Second, we regressed the attitude– behavior relation on direct
experience, the behavior relevance of attitudes, and the interaction between
the two, excluding the statistically dependent conditions and controlling for
the potential confounds and the value relevance of the attitude issue. The
interaction term of this regression was marginally significant (␤ ⫽ 0.29,
p ⬍ .06). Attitudes based on direct experience predicted behavior better
when behavior relevance was high (r.s ⫽ .59 vs. .48) but not when it was
low (r.s ⫽ .39 and .35).
14
Focus on cognitions or arguments was positively associated with the
attitude– behavior relation in the fixed-effects models. Focus on mood or
affect was unrelated to the attitude– behavior relation. Neither of these
moderators, however, was significant when introduced in the multiple
regression. This pattern suggests that the effect of the congruence between
the attitude and behavior bases supersedes the effect of the specific type of
information that bases attitudes.
15
We did not construct a composite measure of ability because the two
indicators of ability clearly had different associations with the attitude–
behavior correlation.
16
The remaining moderators varied within fewer than two reports.
17
The significance and direction of the effects generally replicated when
we combined the precise within-unit effects of each moderator on the
attitude– behavior correlation. However, the confidence with which the
attitude was held and the time between measures did not reach significance
in the data sets summarized in these analyses.

<-----Page 33----->ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION

Regressing the attitude– behavior correlation on the motivation
to think, the one-sidedness of information participants received or
generated, and the interaction between these two variables (using
the statistically independent conditions in Table 2 and controlling
for the moderators that significantly influenced the attitude–
behavior relation in these conditions) yielded a marginally significant interaction term (␤ ⫽ 0.14, p ⬍ .09). The examination of the
mean attitude– behavior correlations corresponding to these interactions showed a fairly complex pattern. That is, when the information that participants received or generated was two-sided,
highly motivated participants showed higher attitude– behavior
correlations than participants with either moderate or low motivation (adjusted weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlation for
high-motivation participants was .50, vs. .36 and .39 for moderateand low-motivation participants, respectively). In contrast, when
participants received or generated one-sided information, the
attitude– behavior relation was significantly lower when motivation was low than when it was either moderate or high (adjusted
weighted-mean attitude– behavior correlation for low motivation
equaled .42, vs. .58 and .66 for moderate and high motivation,
respectively).
We conducted similar analyses to examine the interaction between motivation and the behavioral relevance of attitudes. The
interaction term, after we regressed the attitude– behavior correlation on indicants of motivation and behavioral relevance (together
with the significant moderators in the statistically independent
conditions in Table 2), was also marginally significant (␤ ⫽
⫺0.14, p ⬍ .09). Adjusted weighted-mean correlations indicated
that behavioral relevance did not matter when motivation was
high: Both high- and low-relevance conditions had high correlations between attitudes and behaviors (adjusted r.s ⫽ .59 and .57
for high and low relevance). In contrast, when motivation was
either low or moderate, behavioral relevance was critical. When
motivation was low, the low and high behavioral relevance conditions had r.s ⫽ .25 and .45, respectively. Likewise, when motivation was moderate, the low and high behavioral relevance conditions had r.s ⫽ .25 and .47, respectively. That is, relevance
needed to be high for the attitude– behavior relation to be high in
the low-motivation situations.

Mediating Processes in the Attitude–Behavior Relation
The analyses we reported earlier examined the effects of the
proposed moderators on the attitude– behavior correlation. However, these analyses cannot establish the order in which these
moderators exerted their effect (see Figure 1). Establishing a
causal sequence from meta-analytic correlational data is not always possible. However, the relations proposed in our study relied
on a solid theoretical foundation. Further, our database excluded
the uncontrolled effect of past experiences with the attitude object.
These two aspects make our data set ideal for mediational analyses
(see, e.g., Shadish, 1996).
Of course, we could not fully test the model in Figure 1 because
only some studies reported attitude accessibility and stability.
However, we conducted three partial analyses that shed light on
the relevant issues. The first two concerned the effect of accessibility, and the third examined stability as a mediator of the processes we considered.

811

Attitude accessibility. As we explained previously, the measures of attitude accessibility were not comparable across study
reports (see Table 1). Thus, we followed the fixed-effects withinunit calculations to see whether accessibility mediated the effects
of other moderators on the attitude– behavior correlation (see left
side of Figure 1). For this purpose, we used listwise deletion
procedures to construct two separate correlation matrices. The two
correlation matrices included the within-unit weighted-mean correlations (calculated from Pearson correlations) between the
attitude– behavior correlation and the relevant moderators.18 The
sample size in these analyses equaled the number of participants in
the matrix. These correlation matrices were constructed for repeated attitude expression or report and direct behavioral experience. These were the two moderators that affected the attitude–
behavior correlation and varied in more than one report that
included measures of attitude accessibility.19 The relevant path
models appear in Figure 2, Panels A and B. A visual inspection of
each model together with the corresponding Sobel (1982) tests
indicated that accessibility mediated the influence of the repeated
expression of attitudes and direct experience.
Attitude stability. We next fitted a path analysis to observe the
mediating role of stability depicted in Figure 1. This analysis
allowed us to examine the influences of participants’ motivation
(assessed through a composite of value relevance, outcome relevance, and need for cognition), the behavioral relevance of attitude
(as indicated by the correlation between attitudes and cognitions
about behavioral outcomes), the one-sidedness of the information
participants received or were induced to think about (as assessed
by a composite of the reception of one-sided information and the
absence of induction of two-sided nonspontaneous thoughts), and
the reported attitude confidence (as assessed by participants’ ratings of confidence, standardized to control for differences in
confidence scales) on attitude stability and on the attitude–
behavior correlation. The correlation matrix used as a basis for this
analysis was obtained through pairwise deletion. It involved simple correlations among all the variables in the model (e.g., between
the scale-free mean attitude confidence and attitude– behavior
correlation).
The results from the path analysis are displayed in Figure 3 (fit
indexes are reported in the figure caption). As predicted, greater
attitude confidence, behavioral relevance of attitudes, and onesidedness of the attitude-related information all correlated with
greater attitude stability. In addition, one-sidedness of the attituderelated information also affected attitude stability by inducing
greater attitude confidence (Sobel z ⫽ 2.03, p ⬍ .05). Attitude
confidence, the behavior relevance of attitudes, and the information one-sidedness, in turn, influenced the attitude– behavior correlation by promoting more stable attitudes (Sobel z ⫽ 4.08, p ⬍
.001; Sobel z ⫽ 2.32, p ⬍ .05; and Sobel z ⫽ 2.79 p ⬍ .001,
respectively). Finally, a significant Sobel test suggested that the
effect of motivation on the attitude– behavior relation was mediated by greater behavioral relevance of attitudes (Sobel z ⫽ 2.02,
18

We used listwide rather than pairwise deletion for these analyses
because the matrices resulting from pairwise deletion were anomalous.
19
We constructed two separate correlation matrices because no study
that included measures of accessibility manipulated both repeated attitude
expression or report and direct behavioral experience.

within-report Pearson rs converted to r.s. Units in these analyses were all reports involving measures of

p ⬍ .05; the attitude-– behavior correlation instead of stability was
used as the outcome variable for this analysis because the latter
was not associated with motivation in this data set).20,21

Disentangling Accessibility and Stability
The ideal test of the model in Figure 1 is to simultaneously
introduce attitude accessibility (which should reflect retrieval of
attitudes from memory) and attitude stability (which may reflect
attitude retrieval but also reconstruction) along with the antecedents of the two as external variables. However, we could not fit this
model because few conditions reported both accessibility and
stability measures.
To distinguish accessibility and stability, we thus used other
approaches. To begin, we used the within-unit procedures previously described to estimate the association between accessibility
and stability. These analyses yielded r. ⫽ .06, p ⬍ .09. This
correlation implies very little overlap between the two constructs.
Second, we checked whether the antecedents of accessibility were
similar to the antecedents of stability. On the one hand, repeated
expression of attitudes should influence attitude accessibility (retrieval). Moreover, any influence of repeated expression on stability should be accounted for by the influence of repeated expression
on accessibility (see Cooke & Sheeran, 2004; Fazio et al., 1982).

On the other hand, the behavioral relevance of attitudes, the
correlation between attitudes and beliefs about behavioral outcomes, and the information one-sidedness should influence stability via reconstruction. That is, these three factors may promote
attitude stability because they make earlier attitudes easier to
reconstruct at the time of the behavior (see Ajzen, 1996; Doll &
Ajzen, 1992; Erber et al., 1995). In keeping with this rationale,
repeated attitude expression should correlate with accessibility and
stability. In contrast, the behavior relevance of attitudes, the correlation between attitudes and beliefs about behavioral outcomes,

20

In the path analyses, we calculated Sobel tests by linking the independent variable with the mediator (e.g., confidence with stability) and
then the mediator and the independent variable with the dependent variable
(e.g., confidence and stability with the attitude– behavior correlation).
However, when mediation was proven, direct paths that became nonsignificant (i.e., the paths linking information one-sidedness and confidence
with the attitude– behavior relation; ps ⬍ .4 and .8, respectively) were
excluded from the model.
21
Note that, despite the coherence of the findings, we conducted path
analyses using the less conservative fixed-effects approach. Thus, the
findings should be considered with caution.

fit when the associated significance value is higher than .05. The Bentler–Bonett normed fit index, the
comparative fit index, and the Bollen’s incremental fit index reflect good fit when they exceed .90 (Bentler &
Wu, 1995), and the root-mean-square residual represents adequate fit when it is equal to or less than .10. The

and the information one-sidedness should correlate with stability
but not with accessibility.
These predictions were supported when we estimated the associations involving these variables. On the one hand, repeated
expression of attitudes was highly related to attitude accessibility
(within-unit r. ⫽ .77, p ⬍ .001). Moreover, repeated expression of
attitudes also correlated with attitude stability (between-units ␤ ⫽
.31, p ⬍ .05). On the other hand, attitude stability correlated
positively with the association of attitudes with beliefs about
behavior outcomes (between-units ␤ ⫽ .25, p ⬍ .1) and with the
one-sidedness of the information (between-units ␤ ⫽ .43, p ⬍ .01;
within-unit r. ⫽ .42, p ⬍ .001). However, neither of these variables nor the behavioral relevance of attitudes correlated with
attitude accessibility ( p ⬍ .3, p ⬍ .7, and p ⬍ .2, respectively).22
Finally, we introduced repeated attitude expression for accessibility in the path analysis of stability (Cooke & Sheeran, 2004;
Fazio et al., 1982; see Figure 3). This analysis showed that the
proxy measure of accessibility influenced the attitude– behavior
relation through attitude stability (Sobel z ⫽ 3.81, p ⬍ .001; the
r ⫽ .21, p ⬍ .05 direct path between repeated attitude reports and
the attitude– behavior relation became nonsignificant, p ⬍ .7). It is

important to note that the effect of accessibility on stability was
independent of the behavioral relevance of attitudes, the onesidedness of the attitude-related information, and the attitude confidence. Thus, we concluded that accessibility or retrieval of
attitudes influenced stability. Nonetheless, stability was also contingent on factors facilitating attitude reconstruction.

Discussion
Several decades of research have stressed the importance of
understanding how attitudes guide behaviors (Eagly & Chaiken,
1993; Petty et al., 1995; Regan & Fazio, 1977). Given the significance of this topic, it is not surprising to find several metaanalyses addressing the multiple moderators of the attitude–
behavior relation. None of these meta-analyses, however, has
summarized the degree to which newly formed attitudes predict
22
The behavioral relevance of attitudes did not vary within any conditions reporting attitude stability. Only coefficients calculated on the basis
of two or more studies were used to estimate the within-unit associations.

GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

future behavior. Nor have they identified the factors that moderate
attitude– behavior correlations in those cases. Perhaps more important, none of them focused on how those factors influence the
processes involved in the prediction of behaviors from attitudes.
In our review, the overall weighted-mean attitude– behavior
correlation was .52. This correlation is higher than the .38 average
identified by Kraus (1995) when he included studies with low
attitude– behavior correspondence in object, context, and time
(e.g., prediction of church attendance from attitudes toward religion). This correlation, however, is virtually identical to the one
Kraus found when he included studies that measured attitudes and
behaviors in ways that were highly corresponding. This high
correspondence was the case of the reports synthesized in our
meta-analysis. To this extent, the results from this and Kraus’s
meta-analyses are compatible (see also D. S. Wallace et al., 2005,
for a recent discussion of the size of the attitude– behavior correlation). The weighted-mean correlation we found is also stronger
than the .38 correlation reported by Albarracı́n et al. (2001). This
earlier meta-analysis, however, was specific to the attitude–
behavior relation in the domain of condom use, a behavior that
varies widely with factors other than attitudes (e.g., control perceptions; Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005; Glasman & Albarracı́n, 2003;
Sheeran, Abraham, & Orbell, 1999).
The most important contribution of our meta-analysis comes
from the analysis of moderators pertaining to attitude accessibility
and attitude stability. Our meta-analysis suggests that people form
attitudes more predictive of behavior when they are motivated to
think about the object they are considering, have direct experience
with the attitude object, report their attitudes frequently, construct
their attitudes on the basis of information that is relevant to the
behavior, receive or generate either positive or negative information about the object, and believe that their attitudes are correct.
Furthermore, our findings shed light on the processes by which
some of these factors influence the attitude– behavior correspondence. In this regard, our review indicates that forming accessible
attitudes, considering the consequences of performing a behavior
when first forming an attitude, storing evaluatively consistent
(one-sided) information, and holding confident attitudes all allow
people to use these attitudes as a basis for future behaviors. In
addition, our review indicates that attitude expression and direct
behavioral experience affect the attitude– behavior correspondence
by influencing attitude accessibility. Further, according to our
review, the behavioral relevance of attitudes, the one-sidedness of
their informational bases, and the confidence with which an attitude is held influence the attitude– behavior relation because they
promote attitude stability. To our knowledge, no prior review has
documented all of these effects, nor has primary research previously established the mediating effects of all the moderators we
have examined.

Attitude Accessibility
One finding from this meta-analysis is that the effect of attitude
accessibility was nonsignificant in the between-units analyses.
This finding is not surprising if one considers the large differences
in attitude accessibility in different studies. These differences
could not be controlled in between-units analyses. Most important,
however, the effect became significant in the within-unit associations between response times and the attitude– behavior correspon-

dence. Moreover, when we controlled for between-units variance,
direct experience and repeated expression or report of the attitude
strengthened the attitude– behavior correspondence through attitude accessibility (see Figure 2). This conclusion is consistent with
Fazio’s (1989) model. However, our study provides a test of the
complete causal sequence from repeated attitude expression and
direct experience to attitude accessibility and attitude– behavior
consistency. Furthermore, the use of attitude-formation studies to
establish these causal connections is ideal. This approach, for
example, controls for the alternative hypothesis that the attitudes
people report more quickly derive from past behavioral performances in that domain (see Bem, 1972).

Attitude Stability
According to Ajzen (1996) and Erber et al. (1995), the stability
of the attitude-related information influences the stability of attitudes and the extent to which these attitudes predict behavior. This
possibility is consistent with findings from past primary research
(i.e., Doll & Ajzen, 1992) and meta-analyses (i.e., Cooke &
Sheeran, 2004; Kraus, 1995). However, our review precisely establishes the mediating role of stability. That is, the research on
attitude formation that we have synthesized allows us to observe
the relation between the attitude stability across two time points
and the degree to which the initial attitude predicts subsequent
behavior. In contrast, similar findings using past attitudes could
imply that factors that affected attitude stability also affected the
attitude’s behavioral impact. In that case, stability and the attitude–
behavior relation might or might not be causally associated.

Attitude Accessibility and Stability as Indicators of
Attitude Retrieval and Reconstruction
This article also clarifies that attitude accessibility and stability
can capture partially different processes. First, our work supports
previous findings suggesting that accessible attitudes are both
more stable and better predictors of behavior. This stability presumably occurs because accessible attitudes are easily retrievable
from memory. However, we also found that attitudes can be stable
and predictive of behavior when they are not retrieved from
memory but reconstructed on line. It is assumed that the association of attitudes with behavioral and one-sided information makes
earlier attitudes easier to reconstruct at the time people perform a
behavior (see Ajzen & Sexton, 1999; Doll & Ajzen, 1992; Erber et
al., 1995). This finding sheds light on previous controversies on
the role of accessibility and stability and the possibility of disentangling the two.

Influences on Attitude Accessibility and Stability
Behavioral relevance of attitude-related information. Our
study underlines the congruence between the information that
guides initial attitudes and the information used for a behavioral
decision later on. In the past, this conclusion was presented as a
measurement problem. Both primary research and meta-analyses
have revealed that attitudes predict behavior better when measures
of attitudes and behaviors correspond in target, context, time, and
action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977, 1980; Kim & Hunter, 1993;
Kraus, 1995). The present results, however, go beyond those prior

<-----Page 37----->ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION

ones. Our findings establish that attitudes predict behavior better
when they rely on information relevant to a behavioral decision.
For instance, if a behavior is instrumental, beliefs are more relevant than affect. Similarly, if a behavior is public, attitudes expressed in public are more relevant than attitudes expressed in
private. That is, the behavioral relevance of the attitude-relevant
information guarantees the recycling of the attitude at the time of
the behavior (see Figure 3).
Regarding the behavioral relevance of the information associated with an attitude, our study has uncovered a previously unknown role of cognitions about the outcomes of a behavior. These
cognitions are key components of Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980)
theory of reasoned action. According to this theory, a person’s
attitude toward performing a behavior is based on his or her beliefs
that the behavior will bring about a set of salient outcomes (combined with the perceived desirability of each of these outcomes).
Complementing this assumption, we found that stronger associations between attitudes and cognitions about behavior outcomes
correlated positively with attitude stability and attitude– behavior
consistency.
One-sidedness of attitude-related information. This metaanalysis shows that presenting one-sided information about an
object increases attitude stability. This stability occurs because
people initially form and later reconstruct attitudes on the basis of
similar information (Schwarz & Bohner, 2001; Wilson & Hodges,
1992). This conclusion replicates findings by Kraus (1995) and
Cooke and Sheeran (2004). It also replicates findings from primary
research on attitude ambivalence and inconsistency (R. Norman,
1975; Rosenberg, 1960, 1968). However, our meta-analysis extends this work by disentangling prior controversial findings regarding the roles of ambivalence and inconsistency (see null
findings regarding attitude stability by Armitage & Conner, 2000;
Bassili, 1996; and reversals regarding attitude–intentions correlation by Jonas et al., 1997; Sengupta & Johar, 2002). In particular,
our results indicate that, all things being equal, information onesidedness promotes higher attitude stability and stronger attitude–
behavior correlations. However, they also suggest that people who
have inconsistent information about an object can nonetheless
exhibit strong attitude– behavior correlations when they are highly
motivated to think about that information. It is assumed that highly
motivated individuals are able to integrate ambiguous information
in a single evaluative dimension (Sengupta & Johar, 2002; Tesser
& Cowan, 1977). Thus, they form attitudes that can be easy to
reconstruct despite the conflicting implications of the information
that is initially salient.
Confidence. This meta-analysis replicates prior reports that
confident attitudes are more predictive of behavior than doubtful
ones (Berger & Mitchell, 1989; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; Jonas et
al., 1997; Tormala & Petty, 2002). Although we obtained a significant attitude confidence effect only in the within-unit analysis,
several things are significant in our results. First, attitude confidence reflected the one-sidedness of the attitudinal bases and
increased the attitude– behavior correlation by inducing greater
attitude stability. Second, by summarizing findings from novel
attitudes, our meta-analysis provides an indication about the direction of the effect. Without this focus, it is possible to speculate
that confident attitudes are associated with behavior because attitudes that have not changed in the past are perceived as confident
and are likely to be stable in the future (see Albarracı́n et al., 2004).

815

If this were true, attitude confidence would be a by-product of past
stability, with no causal role in the promotion of future stability.
Our meta-analysis helps to rule out this possibility.
The role of amount of thought. Results of our synthesis support earlier conclusions about the role of motivation to think about
an issue in the attitude– behavior correspondence. In particular, our
meta-analysis confirms that people who care about an issue when
they first consider it (high outcome and value relevance) are more
likely to act on these attitudes than participants who do not care
(B.T. Johnson & Eagly, 1989; Leippe & Elkin, 1987; Petty &
Cacioppo, 1986; Petty et al., 1995).23
In addition, our meta-analysis establishes some of the mediational mechanisms of the influence of motivation on the attitude–
behavior relation. In particular, moderation and mediation analyses
showed that greater motivation stimulates people to associate their
attitudes with behavioral information. The association of attitudes
with behavioral information, in turn, increases attitude stability
and the attitude– behavior relation. This process was initially suggested by Ajzen (1996). He specifically argued that people who
think about the attitude object are more able to consider information that is relevant for later behaviors. High-thought people can
also discard information that is temporarily salient but irrelevant.
However, we are the first to examine the complete sequence by
which motivation exerts this influence.
One aspect of this review that may surprise readers is that
concentration (lack of distracting stimuli in the external environment) did not have the expected effect on the attitude– behavior
association. However, other indicators of amount of thought
showed a consistently positive effect. Therefore, it seems necessary to await research with more precise measures of concentration
in the hope that increased precision will bring about coherent
findings.
The role of direct experience. There has been an impressive
amount of research on the role of direct experience in the attitude–
behavior relation (e.g., Berger & Mitchell, 1989; Cooke & Sheeran, 2004; Doll & Ajzen, 1992; Fazio & Zanna, 1978b; Kraus,
1995). In light of this evidence, the initial inverse relation of direct
experience and the attitude– behavior correlation found in our
study (see the 4th, 8th, and 11th columns in Table 2) is puzzling.
In our analyses, however, direct experience was positively associated with the attitude– behavior correlation when we controlled
for the behavioral relevance and one-sidedness of the attitudinal
bases. In this regard, our synthesis suggests possible boundary
conditions for the positive effect of direct experience on the
attitude– behavior correspondence. First, direct experience does
not seem to induce more consequential attitudes when the attitudes
and the behavior bases are incongruent (e.g., if people focus on
feelings and then perform an instrumental behavior; Millar &
Tesser, 1986). Second, acquiring direct experience with the object
may be as important in guiding behavior as receiving information
that is unambiguous and consistent (i.e., evaluative diagnosticity;
23

Unlike past research by Cacioppo et al. (1986), indicants of chronic
motivation to think (need for cognition) had a marginally significant
impact on the attitude– behavior relation in our synthesis. This lack of
effect, however, may reflect our use of median splits instead of the
selection of the most extreme levels of need for cognition, as in Cacioppo
et al.’s research.

<-----Page 38----->816

GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

Reed, Wooten, & Bolton, 2002; see also Ha & Hoch, 1989; Hoch
& Ha, 1986; Wooten & Reed, 1998). When all else is equal, direct
experience should stimulate the use of attitudes as a basis for
behavior. However, direct experience can provide mixed evidence
about the desirability of an object (e.g., people are presented with
neutrally valenced information; Reed et al., 2002; or products with
standard qualities; Hoch & Ha, 1986). To this extent, researchers
should take into account all direct experience, other indicators of
behavioral relevance, and evaluative one-sidedness of the information to understand the impact of attitudes on behavior.

Validity of a Meta-Analysis and the Use of Between- and
Within-Unit Moderating Analyses
In this synthesis, we used within- and between-units analyses to
detect the moderators of the attitude– behavior relation. Each of
these methods has unique advantages. On the one hand, withinunit analyses better account for methodological differences among
research paradigms. However, they depend on the manipulations
in primary studies. In other words, they show what the primary
studies have already shown.
On the other hand, between-units analyses are more vulnerable
to differences among study procedures.24 This problem is most
acute when researchers make no attempt to control for potentially
confounding factors and when the meta-analysis is not theory
based. However, between-units analyses have important advantages. First, they go beyond primary research and allow researchers to address new questions and to use novel comparisons. For
example, studies to date have seldom, if ever, jointly estimated the
influence of direct experience and information with specific evaluative implications. In this context, the between-units procedures
permitted this integration. Second, multiple regressions of
between-units conditions estimated the combined influence of the
selected moderators and identified nonspurious relations. Similar
analyses were not possible with the within-unit approach. Thus,
the inclusion of within- and between-units analyses allowed us to
go beyond previous research while keeping a high level of methodological rigor. Further, in the case in which results with the
alternative methods conflicted, these differences led us to identify
potential boundary conditions for the moderator’s effect. In other
words, the use of both methodologies provides a more valid
integration than the use of either methodology alone.

Attitude Formation Studies and the Validity and
Generalizability of Our Findings
A unique aspect of our meta-analysis is the inclusion of attitude
formation rather than attitude change and survey studies. At first
glance, this criterion seems to limit the amount of information in our
database without contributing to precision. For example, people often
apply information about old attitudes to the new objects they encounter (Prislin et al., 1998). Thus, attitude formation studies cannot
perfectly control for the one-sidedness of the information underlying
these new attitudes. However, attitude formation studies do provide
the most efficient control for other moderators. For instance, when an
object is familiar, participants might have had direct experiences with
the object that are not at all captured in attitude change experiments.
Similarly, studying the influence of prior reports of attitudes is not
possible outside of the studies manipulating the repeated expression or

report of attitudes. In contrast, selecting attitude formation studies
enabled us to classify all studies in terms of amount of thought,
information one-sidedness, behavioral relevance of the information,
and direct experience, among other moderators and potential confounds. Clearly, no attitude change study would contain information
about measures or manipulations of the 21 moderators and potential
confounds we have examined.
Integrating attitude formation (vs. attitude change) studies is also
important for inferring causality from meta-analytic data (see Shadish,
1996, for a discussion of causal inferences in meta-analyses). That is,
integrating attitude formation studies sets baseline levels of some
moderators (e.g., attitude stability, repeated expression of attitudes,
direct behavioral experience) at zero. Therefore, correlations involving those moderators provide appropriate estimates of the causal
associations among them. For example, the integration of attitude
formation studies helped us to better establish a link between accessibility and the attitude– behavior relation because this aspect reduces
the likelihood that accessible attitudes result from past behavioral
performances (an effect also observed in our meta-analysis).
Finally, our database included mostly laboratory experiments
and college students. This scope may decrease the external validity
of our results. Although further research could explore the
attitude– behavior relation following attitude formation in the field,
two things are noteworthy in our study. First, our results were
tested with different samples of conditions. The significance and
direction of the effects replicated in most cases. On these grounds,
we can assume that the results accurately apply to the population
of students in this specific setting.
Second, we also conducted analyses with the between-units
samples using two approaches: fixed-effects and random-effects
models. The fixed-effects approach assumes that the population of
effect sizes is homogeneous. The random-effects approach assumes that the population is heterogeneous and thus indicates that
the findings might be applicable to broader settings. In our study,
results of the random-effects and fixed-effects approaches were
comparable in size and significance. This equivalence of the findings in the random-effects and fixed-effects approaches renders the
generalizability of our results to other settings plausible.

The Role of the Behavior Measure
A factor that could also influence our result is the availability of
different types of behavior measures. For example, some of the
24

The between-units analyses controlled for potential confounds in
several ways. First, we tested the moderators’ effects using three different
samples of between-units conditions. Results replicated for most moderators. Second, we estimated conclusions about between-units effects after
controlling for several potential confounding factors. That is, all multiple
regression models included indicators of the value of the attitude issue, the
type of research paradigm, the publication status and year of the study, and
the time between the attitude and behavior measures. Third, the shifting
unit of analyses approach controlled for the overrepresentation of studies
with more effect sizes. Fourth, the elimination of the within-subject measures in longitudinal reports discarded the statistically dependent conditions. Finally, aspects such as the laboratory setting, the use of students as
participants, the relatively high credibility of the information sources, the
measure of actual behavior, and the use of frequency scales as attitude
measures were constant or almost constant in our database. Thus, procedural differences could not distort the between-units findings.

<-----Page 39----->ATTITUDE–BEHAVIOR RELATION

behaviors in our database were dichotomous (e.g., voting in favor
of or against the institution of comprehensive exams). Other behaviors (e.g., the time participants played with puzzles) were
continuous. Continuous behavior measures can better capture different degrees of favorableness toward an object. Therefore, continuous behaviors may be more reliable indicators of attitudes than
dichotomous ones (Jaccard & Blanton, 2005).
Most aspects of the behavior measures in the studies we integrated,
however, were homogeneous. For example, we excluded studies
involving behavior self-reports. Hence, behavioral responses did not
vary as a function of recall. In addition, participants in our database
had equal behavioral opportunities and faced no situational obstacles
to perform the behavior they chose. Further, in most cases, participants performed single behaviors or chose between behaviors that
represented different degrees of favorableness toward the attitude
object (e.g., sign a petition vs. join a committee). In only two cases,
participants opted between different behavioral alternatives (i.e.,
Ajzen & Fishbein, 1970, 1974). To this extent, we do not expect
measures of behaviors to systematically bias our results beyond the
moderators we have already considered.

Implications for Future Research
This meta-analysis supports long-held assumptions about how attitudes predict behaviors. Perhaps more important, it sheds light on
mechanisms that underlie these predictions. For example, our data
support Fazio’s (1990) hypothesis that attitudes people access from
memory easily are more predictive of behaviors than attitudes that are
difficult to access. Also, our work verifies Ajzen’s (1996) hypothesis
that the association of attitudes with behavior-related information
(which is more likely to occur when an issue is personally relevant)
strengthens the attitude’s correlation with behavior. However, our
results suggest that people who receive unambiguous information
may behave consistently with their attitudes even when the content of
that information is not behavioral. Therefore, future research should
establish the conditions under which the behavioral relevance or the
one-sidedness of the information predominates.
Similarly, future research can also address the relative influence
of forming an attitude from direct experience or from one-sided
information. That is, direct experience proved to increase the
attitude– behavior correspondence. However, our meta-analysis
suggests that this is more likely when the information that people
acquire is one-sided. When information is mixed, direct experience
should depress the attitude– behavior correlation. Further research
could examine this prediction.
Another ambiguity that our work could only partially resolve
concerns the impact of the one-sidedness of the attitude-related information. Contrary to most research on attitude ambivalence (see R.
Norman, 1975; Rosenberg, 1960, 1968), recent research (e.g., Jonas et
al., 1997; Sengupta & Johar, 2002) has suggested that heterogeneous
attitude-related information can promote cognitive effort and thus
increase the attitude– behavior relation. However, as Sengupta and
Johar (2002) pointed out, this effect takes place when the positive
information and the negative information are simultaneously accessible. In our review, we could not control for the accessibility of the
contradictory information at the time of the behavior performance.
However, such controls might be available in the future.
Finally, further work could also explore the possibility that the
attitude– behavior correlation is a function of nonlinear patterns. For

817

instance, our results suggest that inducing high motivation when one
processes double-sided information may increase attitude– behavior
correlations. However, this finding does not consider the degree or
type of conflict that the information involves. For example, when people
who must make a behavior decision consider positive and negative
outcomes of the behavior, conflict resolution may be difficult. In this
case, attitude– behavior associations might be strongest when relevance is high enough to promote identification of the conflict and thus
use of the global attitude but not so high as to promote the construction of diametrically different attitudes. Whatever the case, our metaanalysis shows that, despite the quantity of studies generated to
resolve the attitude– behavior problem, more process-oriented research is still necessary to understand how attitudes guide behaviors.

Implications for Practice
For many decades, scholars and practitioners have attempted to
find ways to induce the attitudes that best predict behaviors (see
Albarracı́n et al., 2003; Armitage & Conner, 2002; Echabe, Rovira, &
Garate, 1988; Manfredo, Yuan, & McGuire, 1992; Marsh, Johnson, &
Scott-Sheldon, 2001; P. Norman & Smith, 1995). This meta-analysis
can contribute to the design of social interventions by identifying
factors that increase the behavioral impact of the attitudes one manages to induce in an audience. It suggests that, for example, agencies
aiming at increasing the frequency of a new behavior should be well
aware of the likely motivation of the targets, the evaluative implications of the behavior, and the situational factors that typically influence the behavior they want to promote. Thus, audiences of those
agencies will benefit from receiving unambiguous behavioral information about an object and from attempts to increase their motivation
to think about the behavior being promoted.
Further, to induce desirable behaviors, agencies should consider
how clearly positive the experience with the object is likely to be.
Thus, for behaviors that are likely to be clearly positive (e.g., eating a
new type of candy), inducing direct experience with the object may be
the strategy of choice. However, for experiences that are unlikely to
be unambiguously positive or unambiguously negative (e.g., using a
new type of condom, which increases protection but decreases physical pleasure), inducing direct experience may be less effective than
presenting information whose implications are controlled beforehand.
In addition to the likely desirability of a behavioral experience,
agencies may look at factors related to the behavior they want to
promote. For example, eating candy is more likely to be a hedonic
behavior. Using a new type of condom is an instrumental behavior.
Thus, inducing a focus on feelings should be more effective for
promoting the new candy than for promoting the new condom.
Finally, our results suggest that well-known strategies to increase
the availability of attitudes for judgment (e.g., having people
express their attitudes, presenting memorable information about
the object) may also contribute to successfully inducing attitudes
that predict the behaviors that persuaders want to promote.

Limitations and Perspectives
Despite the relevance of our findings for understanding the behavioral impact of attitudes, this research integration has limitations. First,
the selection of attitude formation studies allowed for a clear-cut
estimation of different factors (e.g., the degree to which participants’
attitudes were based on direct experience, the number of times they

<-----Page 40----->818

GLASMAN AND ALBARRACÍN

were exposed to information about the object beforehand). However,
people may easily generalize information about the attributes of
familiar objects to the new attitudes they form. Hence, the estimation
of factors such as the one-sidedness of the information that serves as
basis of people’s attitudes might not be as precise.
Second, as we explain in Footnote 24, we have taken several
measures to control for potential confounding factors. These measures
also served to examine the validity of our findings across several
samples of conditions. However, in a meta-analysis, studies are not
randomly assigned to conditions. Hence, uncoded differences among
studies may account for the observed effects. For example, direct
experience was negatively associated with the attitude– behavior relation in the between-units analyses but positively associated in the
within-unit analyses. An inspection of this finding suggested that the
reversal was accounted for by conditions with low behavioral relevance
of the initial attitudes. In other cases, however, unknown differences
among primary studies could contribute to the observed effects.
Third, although our database integrated 128 effect sizes, some of
the analyses had a smaller number of study conditions than others. For
example, we were able to estimate the effect of most of the relevant
moderators on the attitude– behavior relation using the whole sample
of studies. However, our results regarding the processes by which
accessibility and stability influence the attitude– behavior relation
included 43 and 19 units, respectively. Even though these analyses
still comprised 1,612 and 864 participants, future research replicating
our findings would increase confidence in our conclusions.
There are also factors that proved to influence the attitude–
behavior association but were not considered in our integration. For
example, recent findings by Visser and Mirabile (2004) have underlined the influence of the social networks on attitude stability. Other
findings by Smith and Terry (2003) and White, Hogg, and Terry
(2002) discussed the influence of in-group norms on the attitude–
behavior relation. Future accumulation of work on the impact of
normative factors should allow researchers to incorporate them in a
broader model of the attitude– behavior relation. Similarly, future
research on attitude formation should take advantage of real-world
situations. These could include the introduction of new health recommendations, political candidates, or consumer products.
Finally, results of this meta-analysis apply to the prediction of
behavior from novel attitudes. The formation of a new attitude is
probably the most effective way to experimentally control the properties of an attitude and the associated information. However, people
can develop more accessible and confident attitudes over time. Thus,
they may simply use those attitudes without attempting to reconstruct
them later on (see Lingle & Ostrom, 1981). Even more relevant, as
objects become familiar, attitudes can connect to the values of the
individuals holding them. People who consider their attitudes important seek more information about the attitude object and have better
memory for issues related to the attitude (Holbrook, Berent, Krosnick,
Visser, & Boninger, 2005). To this extent, determining whether attitudes are important may be critical to understanding the attitude–
behavior relation when attitudes are well established.

Conclusion
The attitude– behavior relation has been at the center of discussion
in social psychology for years. At one point in time, discouraging
findings regarding the size of the attitude– behavior relation stimulated recommendations to abandon the attitude concept altogether

(Wicker, 1969). This pessimism was fortunately countered by efforts
to identify the conditions that make attitudes more consequential for
overt behaviors (e.g., Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Ajzen &
Madden, 1986; Bargh et al., 1996; Doll & Ajzen, 1992; Fazio, 1989,
1990; Fazio et al., 1982; Fazio & Towles-Schwen, 1999; Fazio &
Zanna, 1978a, 1978b; Kraus, 1995; Sengupta & Fitzimons, 2000;
Wilson et al., 1984). These efforts have led to the accumulation of a
large literature on the attitude– behavior relation, which has been
incorporated into at least 10 previous meta-analyses (Armitage &
Conner, 2001; Cooke & Sheeran, 2004; Eckes & Six, 1994; Farley et
al., 1981; Kim & Hunter, 1993; Kraus, 1995; Notani, 1998; Sheppard
et al., 1988; Van den Putte, 1993; D. S. Wallace et al., 2005).
The existence of 10 attitude– behavior meta-analyses across
domains and various others relevant to specific domains (e.g.,
Albarracı́n et al., 2003; Hausenblas, Carron, & Mack, 1997; Lynn
& McCall, 2000; Sheeran et al., 1999; Whitley, Nelson, & Jones,
1999) suggests that there are answers to the most important questions about this problem. However, a closer analysis of the prior
syntheses indicates that such a conclusion is wrong. First, whereas
other meta-analyses included a range of studies with varying
degrees of rigor in methodological control, in our meta-analysis,
we have explored the processes responsible for the attitude–
behavior relation by selecting studies about attitude formation. By
doing so, we were able to examine the factors influencing attitudes, which can be more efficiently observed when attitudes are
produced experimentally. Further, out of the 10 most general
meta-analyses, only Kraus’s (1995) and Cooke and Sheeran’s
(2004) examined the roles of the moderators that we also examined. However, neither Kraus’s nor Cooke and Sheeran’s studies
estimated the moderators’ joint contribution and the ways they can
be sequentially arranged. In contrast, our meta-analysis integrates
memory-based and online processes in a comprehensive, theoretical interpretation of the attitude– behavior process.
In terms of practical implications, our results suggest that attitudes
influence future behaviors when they are easy to retrieve from memory and stable over time. In addition, our meta-analysis shows that
expressing attitudes repeatedly and having direct experience with the
attitude object influence the attitude– behavior relation by inducing
higher attitude accessibility. Our study also indicates that being motivated to think about an object or issue promotes attitudes associated
with one-sided and behavior-relevant information. Forming attitudes
on the basis of behavior-relevant information, receiving or generating
one-sided information, and believing that one’s attitudes are correct,
in turn, strengthen the attitude– behavior relation via greater attitude
stability. Given these findings, our meta-analysis is the first to meaningfully integrate the processes that underlie the influence of attitudes
on behavior. We hope that future research and applications will
benefit from this integration.

Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology1
Call for Papers: Special Issue on
Recent Advances in Psychopharmacology and Mental Health
A Special Issue of Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology on advances in the psychopharmacological treatment of mood and anxiety disorders is planned for early 2007. Mood disorders afflict
an estimated 20.9 million Americans and include major depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and
dysthymic disorders. Anxiety disorders afflict an estimated 40 million Americans and include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, and obsessive– compulsive disorder (OCD). Treatment of
these psychiatric disorders is often complicated by comorbid substance abuse disorders.
Authors are invited to submit original research reports for consideration. All papers will be peer
reviewed and must be submitted electronically. This Special Issue will also contain some invited
review papers on the status of novel pharmacotherapies such as corticotropin-releasing-hormone
(CRH1) receptor antagonists, testosterone supplements, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for
alleviation of depression and anxiety.
The deadline for submission of original research reports is
December 16, 2006.
To submit an article, go to
http://www.jbo.com/jbo3/submissions/dsp_jbo.cfm?journal_code⫽pha
Inquiries about this special issue should be directed to:
