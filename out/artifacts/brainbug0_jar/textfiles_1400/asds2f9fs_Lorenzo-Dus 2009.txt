Impoliteness and broadcast talk
NURIA LORENZO-DUS

Abstract
This paper examines impoliteness in a discourse context marked by double
articulation (i. e., broadcasting), specifically in the television show Dragons’ Den (BBC2, UK). Like past work on impoliteness within ‘exploitative’ reality television, this study explores face-threatening behaviour by
those involved in the interaction within the studio. Analysis of five hours
of broadcast material reveals a number of patterns underlying both the
interactional structure of impoliteness containing sequences and the linguistic realizations of impoliteness in Dragons’ Den. These patterns point to a
clear interactional power imbalance between the expert (‘the dragon’) and
lay (the contestant) person in the studio. They also highlight the interactional power held by the show’s presenter, whose voice-overs set the interactions against the contestant, dictate their development and, importantly,
close off impoliteness containing sequences in such a way that the dragon
invariably has the upper hand. In addition, and unlike any other study to
date, this paper links the findings of the discursive realization of impoliteness in Dragons’ Den to viewer interpretations of impoliteness within two
representative samples from the corpus. Responses (N ⫽ 85) to a questionnaire on (im)politeness show high agreement levels regarding assessment of
dragon and contestant behaviour. They also suggest, however, that isolated
instances of marked face-threatening behaviour determine overall scores of
impoliteness for given speakers and that individual speakers are seen as
more or less impolite depending on their co-interactants’ behaviour. What
is more, respondents’ reasons for their assessments reveal the importance
of local and cultural norms in ascribing impoliteness to certain communicative behaviour.

1. Introduction1
Impoliteness has been recently described as “the long neglected ‘poor
cousin’ of politeness”, its study having “merely crawled forward” (Locher
and Bousfield 2008: 2). Yet, since the mid-1990s, a steady trickle of studies has been published and academic conferences held that have given
much needed impetus to research on not only impoliteness but also its
connection to “relational work” (e. g., Locher 2004, 2006; Locher and
Watts 2005, 2008; Watts 2008)2. Tellingly, too, research on impoliteness
has begun to attract work from several perspectives and backgrounds.
These range from cognitive psychology (e. g., Jay and Janschewitz 2008)
and media discourse studies (e. g., Lorenzo-Dus 2007, 2009) to sociolinguistics (e. g., Holmes et al. 2008) and the analysis of talk-in-interaction
(e. g., Hutchby 2008).
One corollary of this growing body of work is a healthy discussion of
what exactly impoliteness is and, consequently, how best to study it.
Like politeness, impoliteness is inextricably bound to context and best
explored at a discourse level (see, amongst others, Culpeper et al. 2003;
Bousfield 2007, 2008). Yet one context where delineating the boundaries
of (the study of) discourse impoliteness has sparked most academic debate is broadcasting. The main issue at stake has been, and remains,
whether the kind of unmitigated face-threatening behaviour often found
in some forms of broadcasting really constitutes impoliteness. Arguments
for and against have been propounded but these have tended to focus
on interpretation of the intentions behind such face-threatening behaviour by those involved in the interaction within the studio. However, the
links between face-attack in broadcast discourse and its interpretation
by its non-physically co-present, yet main intended, recipients ⫺ the
viewers ⫺ are under-studied. This paper consequently aims to (1) identify patterns underlying the discursive realization of impoliteness in a
broadcast context; and (2) draw upon these in order to explore viewers’
actual interpretations of impoliteness. For clarity of presentation, I
henceforth discuss work relating to (1) and (2) as, respectively, the impoliteness performance (IP) and the impoliteness reception (IR) study.
The context selected for examination is the British version of the reality competition show Dragons’ Den (series 2, BBC2, 2005). This show
originated in Japan but is nowadays broadcast in a number of countries,
including Australia, Canada, Finland, Israel, Nigeria, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Russia and the UK. The basic format of each episode
of the UK edition of Dragons’ Den consists of approximately eleven
entrepreneurs (the contestants), who go into a television studio set (the
‘den’) to pitch their business ideas to five successful venture capitalists
(the ‘dragons’), from whom they seek investment. In their opening pitch,

which lasts no longer than three minutes, the contestants are requested
to name the amount of capital that they need to secure from the dragons
and the percentage of business equity that they are willing to offer in
return. The pitch is followed by a negotiation phase, during which the
dragons probe the contestants about their ideas, negotiate probable
terms of co-operation, profit margins and financial returns. They also
give feedback to the contestants on their pitches. Upon leaving the den,
often empty-handed (or at least considerably lighter in terms of equity
ownership in their own companies), the contestants are debriefed on
camera by the show’s presenter, Evan Davis. Davis combines such onscreen appearances with off-screen commentary (voice-over) during the
episodes.
This paper is structured as follows. I first provide a brief overview of
the nature of broadcast discourse and discuss its implications for the
study of impoliteness (Section 2). Next, I describe the analytic methods
in the IP and IR studies (Section 3). Sections 4 and 5 report and discuss
the findings of these studies. The article concludes with some data-driven
reflections on patterns found to underlie the realization and interpretation of impoliteness in Dragons’ Den (Section 6).
2. Impoliteness and broadcast talk
There is one aspect of broadcast discourse that makes any aspect of its
analysis distinctive vis-à-vis that of other, unmediated, spoken discourse
contexts: its double articulation. As Scannell (1991: 1) put it, broadcast
talk “is a communicative interaction between those participating in discussion, interview, game show or whatever and, at the same time, is
designed to be heard by absent audiences.” Broadcasters aim to meet the
perceived demands of precisely these absent audiences, be it for information, entertainment, education or a combination thereof. Filming of each
of the pitches that comprise each episode of Dragons’ Den, for instance,
takes approximately two hours. Yet, actual broadcast time for each pitch
varies between thirteen minutes and thirty seconds. Audiences are therefore presented with a strategically “designed” and “produced” (in the
sense of Kress and Van Leeuwen 2001) proportion of the entire filmed
material for each episode.
The double articulation of broadcast talk makes its analysis challenging within traditional speaker-hearer models of communication, such as
the one proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in his Course in General
Linguistics (1916). His notion of the “speaking circuit” (1916: 11⫺15),
unsurprisingly given the time at which it was formulated, cannot account
for the “wittingly, knowingly public” (Scannell 1991: 11, original emphasis) nature of broadcast talk. More sophisticated communication models

and proposals have since been developed, of which the one by Erving
Goffman (1981) is worth discussing in some detail given its influence
on much subsequent work on institutional (and specifically broadcast)
communication.
Goffman replaced the traditional notions of speaker and hearer with
those of the “production format” and the “participation framework”
(for the reception of talk). He divided the production format into three
roles: “animator”, “author” and “principal”. These respectively designate “the sounding box from which utterances come”; “the agent who
puts together, composes, or scripts the lines that are uttered”; and “the
party to whose position, stand, and belief the words attest” (1981: 226).
As for the reception of talk, Goffman also identified further roles therein,
namely those of “ratified” and “unratified” recipient. The former refers
to the “official” or intended receivers of a message, who can be either
“addressed” or “unaddressed”. Addressed receivers are those “to whom
the speaker addresses his visual attention and to whom, incidentally, he
expects to turn over his speaking role” (Goffman 1981: 132). Unaddressed receivers are any other of the “official hearers” in a given communicative exchange, even those who may not be actually listening
(1981: 133). Unratified recipients, for their part, are those non-official,
unintended recipients of talk and can be either “overhearers” (“inadvertent”, “non-official” listeners or bystanders) or “eavesdroppers” (“engineered”, “non-official” followers of talk) (1981: 132).
Whilst presenting distinct advantages over speaker-hearer communication models, Goffman’s participation framework is not without its limitations when applied to the study of broadcast talk. Thus, for instance,
being able to identify the various reception roles in which viewers are
positioned within and across forms of talk on television is advantageous.
However, to treat viewers on grounds of their non-physical co-presence
as either “overhearers” or “eavesdroppers”, as has often been the case,
is misleading. In Goffman’s participation framework, the roles of overhearer and eavesdropper are placed within the position of unratified
(unofficial, unintended) recipients of talk. Since the nature and function
of television is to broad-cast, these viewers are by definition ratified (official, intended) recipients of its discourse. They can therefore never be
overhearers/eavesdroppers, however often they may be made to feel so
in a television climate of “voyeurism”3.
It is precisely this climate of voyeurism that is responsible, in part at
least, for the noticeable increase of reality shows on our screens since the
mid-1990s, especially those that make frequent use of unmitigated facethreat. In programmes like Dragons’ Den, The Weakest Link, The People’s Court, The Apprentice and The F Word, for example, face-threatening behaviour is not only commonplace but often maximized through a

wide range of semiotic devices for entertainment purposes (Culpeper
2005; Lorenzo-Dus 2009). Consider in this respect the following typical
realization of the speech act of giving feedback following a contestant’s
sales pitch in Dragons’ Den:

actually (.) I am (.) a qualified
agricultural vehicle fitter engineer (.)

(.) simple as that (.)
it doesn’t work

D2’s critical feedback above is articulated in unmitigated fashion. Yet,
attacking the contestant’s face is far from the only ⫺ let alone the
chief ⫺ ‘intention’ behind such feedback. The confluence of verbal wit
(‘you’re BARKING MAD’, line 03), intimidating face-threatening nonverbal behaviour (pointing in lines 02⫺03), emphatic paralanguage and
categorical evaluation (e. g., ‘I’m out’, line 03, ‘simple as that’, line 04)
all suggest face-aggravating behaviour being designed specifically to
crush the participant’s spirit for televisual entertainment ⫺ to its being
performed as spectacle. This is also reflected in the choice of camera
angles, which juxtapose (medium) close-up shots of D2’s facial expressions and gesturing (lines 01⫺03) to a medium-long range shot of D3
and D4 knowingly smiling at each other during D2’s turn (lines 04⫺05).
The link between unmitigated face-attack and entertainment has been
noted in relation to a number of broadcasting contexts, especially talk
shows (e. g., Grindstaff 1997, 2002; Hutchby 2001; Wood 2001), reality
shows (e. g., Culpeper 2005; Lorenzo-Dus 2008) and political debates
(e. g., Lorenzo-Dus 2009). The kind of emotional release that often accompanies explicit face-attack in tabloid talk shows, for instance, has
been likened to “the money shot” of pornographic films (Grindstaff
1997, 2002). Culpeper (2005) has posited four generic factors for the
entertainment value of impoliteness in ‘exploitative’ reality shows. Firstly,
viewers seem to gain an intrinsic pleasure from the potential for actual
conflict of unmitigated face-attack. Secondly, watching human weaknesses being exploited seems to give viewers voyeuristic pleasure. Thirdly,
viewers apparently enjoy watching others in a worse predicament than
they are ⫺ for example, contestants being made the subject of humiliating one-liners by the shows’ presenters/hosts/experts. Fourthly, viewers
seem to derive pleasure from experiencing the risk of being potentially

involved in confrontation from a safe distance. In these shows, such
confrontation often arises from maximally offensive face-attacks.
In addition to these four generic factors, and as in fictional works, the
kind of maximally offensive face-threat repeatedly found in ‘exploitative’
reality shows is said to help to further narrative plot and to build characters (Culpeper 1998). Being able to carve an idiosyncratic face-attacking
style, as it were, has proven a useful discursive means of turning some
of the presenters of these shows into celebrities. Anne Robinson (e. g.,
The Weakest Link, UK), Gordon Ramsay (e. g., The F Word, Boiling
Point and Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares), Sir Alan Sugar (e. g., The Apprentice, UK), Judge Mathis (e. g., Judge Mathis, US) and the various
dragons in Dragons’ Den, to give but a few examples, have all become
popularly associated with catch phrases, such as “You are the weakest
link, good bye” (Anne Robinson), “You’re fired” (Sir Alan Sugar), “Why
should I give you £ 350,000 of my children’s inheritance?” (Theo Paphitis), “I’d lose my shirt if I invested in you!’ (Peter Jones, Dragons’ Den),
and so on. Across reality television formats, then, unmitigated face-aggravation ⫺ often delivered through verbal wit and inflicted upon ordinary folk ⫺ acts as a regular (‘unmarked’) vehicle for entertainment.
But is this kind of behaviour really impolite? To begin to answer this
question, one needs to clarify the concept of impoliteness. This is no
small task. “The lowest common denominator” amongst existing definitions of impoliteness sees it as “behaviour that is face-aggravating in a
particular context.” (Locher and Bousfield 2008: 3; original emphasis).
Yet, there is a lack of consensus regarding four aspects, namely:
(1) how to label the phenomenon under scrutiny (impoliteness?
rudeness? face-attack? something else entirely?); (2) the ontological status of impoliteness […]; (3) the role of intention (should
impoliteness be restricted to just intended negative consequences? do we need the notion of intention anyway?); and (4)
how to analyze the language and contexts that constitute impoliteness (what analytical framework should we use? what conceptual apparatus do we need?).
(Bousfield and Culpeper 2008: 163; original emphasis).
Obviously, no single study can provide answers to all these questions.
However, it is worth discussing at this juncture perspectives on (3) above,
for the issue of intention is linked to that of norms and both acquire
particular salience in the context of broadcasting.
Kienpointner (2008: 245) regards impoliteness and rudeness as synonymous and describes them as “a kind of prototypically non-cooperative
or competitive communicative behaviour”5. Terkourafi (2008: 70) argues

165

that impoliteness occurs when face-threatening expressions are used,
which are “not conventionalized to the context of occurrence”, but “no
face-threatening intention is attributed to the speaker by the hearer”.
When such recognition of intention takes place, she notes, we are dealing
with the related concept of rudeness. In contrast, Culpeper (various writings; see also Bousfield, various writings) sees impoliteness as necessarily
linked to intention: “Impoliteness, as I would define it, involves communicative behaviour intending to cause the ‘face loss’ of a target or
perceived by the target to be so”. (Culpeper 2008: 36). Culpeper (2008),
moreover, sees intention as being crucial both to first (“lay”) order and
to second (“theoretical”) order approaches to impoliteness. Yet, for
Hutchby (2008), research on impoliteness needs to shift away from analysts categorizing particular linguistic features as (im)polite. Instead, research on impoliteness needs to move towards the analysis of “the ways
that participants in interaction themselves ascribe impoliteness to
others ⫺ or more accurately, display an orientation to the actions of
others as impolite.” (Hutchby 2008: 222)6.
There are also differences of opinion regarding the role played by
norms in ascribing impoliteness to others during interaction. Authors
such as Mills (2005) argue that wherever the norms of a particular “community of practice” allow (and indeed regularly include) highly conflictive face-attack, the latter is not necessarily interpreted by any of the
participants as impolite7. Mills’ point is specifically triggered by research
on impoliteness in the television programme Soldier Girls (Culpeper
1996). In this ‘fly-on-the-wall’ documentary, filmed at a US army recruit
training base in the early 1980s, three sergeants systematically deployed
unmitigated face-threat when interviewing a female recruit. For Mills,
the ritualized and institutionalized nature of their behaviour led to this
recruit probably “not classify[ing] it as impoliteness as such” (2005: 270).
Culpeper offers a counter argument, this time based on the analysis of
data from The Weakest Link. For him, the “high salience of impoliteness
behaviour makes it very difficult for targets to neutralize them by
factoring in context.” (2005: 69). Endorsing Haugh’s (2003) point that
different norms co-occur within any given context, Culpeper (2008: 30)
hypothesizes four such types. These are: “personal norms” (based on the
entirety of an individual’s social experiences); “cultural norms” (based
on the entirety of an individual’s experiences relating to a particular
culture); “situational norms” (based on an individual’s experiences of a
given situation within a specific culture); and “co-textual norms” (based
on an individual’s whole array of experiences in a given interaction
within a particular situation occurring within a specific culture). The
kind of maximally face-threatening behaviours identified in ‘exploitative’
reality shows may not be impolite in theory in that they can be perceived

Nuria Lorenzo-Dus

as a function of these shows. In practice, however, such behaviours are
so saliently impolite vis-à-vis cultural/personal norms that they “can engulf local norms which might otherwise ‘neutralize’ a judgment that it is
impolite.” (Culpeper 2008: 31).
Intention and norms, then, emerge as crucial to establishing whether
or not the kind of face-threatening behaviour regularly found in ‘exploitative’ reality shows is really impolite. However, it is as crucial not to lose
sight of the fact that these shows produce a discursive performance of
intention and norms. When performing uncontrolled ‘negative’ behaviour, including unmitigated face-aggravation, in the highly controlled
setting of the television studios, these shows do not intend to come
across as ‘real’ vis-à-vis real life. Instead, they seek a reality status as
broadcast products, and to be consumed as such (Lunt and Stenner 2005;
Lorenzo-Dus 2009).
The above might be seen as a reason to exclude broadcast contexts
that openly stage maximally offensive face-threat, such as ‘exploitative’
reality shows, from studies of impoliteness. Yet, it is precisely by focusing
on these contexts that we may gain access to aspects of impoliteness
not easily revealed elsewhere. These may include culturally/personally
embedded assumptions of impoliteness, upon which these shows rely in
order to achieve ‘confrontainment’. They may also include, given the
genre’s reliance on verbal cleverness by media-savvy presenters/hosts/
experts, assumptions about ‘the aesthetic value’ of impoliteness. Crucially for this study, these aspects may lead to a better understanding of
how ‘speakers’ and ‘hearers’ (both in and outside of the studio) negotiate
the boundaries between, on the one hand, local and, on the other hand,
personal/cultural norms in communicative contexts that thrive on their
clashing. It is to the methodological design and implications of examining impoliteness in a context marked by such double-articulation of talk
that I turn to next.
3. Methodology
3.1. The IP study: Data and procedure
The data for the IP study consisted of five, one-hour episodes from the
second series of Dragons’ Den (BBC2, 2005), which were recorded and
transcribed in their entirety. The resulting transcripts, totalling over
60.000 words, were coded for discourse moves and impoliteness strategies (see Section 4). The whole corpus was independently coded twice.
This produced a 96 % inter-coder agreement for moves and 92 % for
strategies. Inter-coder differences were subsequently resolved through
discussion.

3.2. The IR study: Data and procedure
The data for the IR study consisted of three short video clips (less than
three minutes each) and a follow-up questionnaire. The questionnaire
was administered to eighty-five respondents, who were familiar with the
Dragons’ Den format and of similar age (nineteen to twenty-two years
old), educational background (first year university students in the UK),
nationality (British) and mixed gender (approximately two-thirds female,
one-third male)8.
Selection of the three video clips was based on the results of the coding
for the IP study (see Section 4). The first clip included only one speaker
(the dragon) and was used as an introductory exercise. The second and
third clip included part of an interactional sequence between a dragon
and a contestant in the den. The questionnaire was designed to gather
information on whether the speakers in the selected clips were perceived
to be (im)polite and, if so, why? This involved first watching one clip at
a time, then rating the speakers’ contribution in the clip along a continuum of (im)politeness, from 1 (very polite) to 5 (very impolite), and
immediately afterwards writing down the reasons for one’s ratings. The
task was conducted in the last forty-five minutes of a two-hour university lecture. Participation was voluntary and respondents had not received formal instruction on (im)politeness theories. It was clearly explained to the participants that the task was not an assessed component
of the course in which it was embedded.
4. The discursive realization of impoliteness in Dragon’s Den
The transcripts used in the IP study included fifty-six interactional sequences between contestants and dragons that contained face-aggravating behaviour. Four episodes had eleven sequences each and one (episode four) had twelve9. Only five of these fifty-six sequences resulted in
the contestants securing some financial investment from the dragons.
These five sequences were distributed rather equally in the corpus: two
in episode one, one in each of episodes two, three and five and none in
episode four. Sixty-five contestants entered the den, with nine sequences
featuring two contestants as business partners and fourteen contestants
being female.
Within each of these episodes, the first, third, seventh and eleventh
sequences were ‘long’, that is, they lasted between five and thirteen minutes. In episode four, the eighth sequence was also long. The remaining
forty-five sequences were ‘short’, lasting between thirteen seconds and
two minutes. Long sequences showed edited material from both the
pitch and the negotiation phase in the den, including each of the five

dragons’ final decision to invest or otherwise. These sequences also
showed edited footage from the post-den debriefing session with presenter Davis. Short sequences, for their part, only occasionally (in approximately one third of the total) included footage from the pitch, tending to focus instead on footage corresponding to the negotiation phase.
Short and long sequences were internally punctuated by between one
and five presenter voice-overs of the type illustrated in (2):

In line 06, the contestant provides a dispreferred answer to D3’s request
for information10: ‘I’m afraid I haven’t got that number’. Rather than
showing D3’s next turn, a voice-over and a camera cut are at this point
introduced. In lines 07⫺08, the camera homes in on D1, who disapprovingly shakes her head. Davis’ voice-over in line 07 (‘the dragons soon
burst that bubble’) mocks, through echoic marked stress on ‘that’, the
contestant’s prior turn. Davis’ voice-over also metaphorically refers to
the contestant’s business product ⫺ a ‘dust bubble’ (line 02) and, in
doing so, provides a typical example of verbal wit designed to ridicule
contestants in the show. The voice-over and the synchronized camera
cut in line 07, moreover, act as a multi-modal bridge to the next fact in
this sequence’s story line. They link a specific exchange between two
participants (D3 and NN) to another exchange between, this time, NN
and D4. The latter’s shifts of footing in lines 8, 10⫺11 are particularly
interestingly. In line 08, D4 starts by taking up the speaker roles of
author and animator, with NN in the role of negatively appraised principal: ‘I think (.) your pitch is appal[ing’. It is worth noting that although
‘I think’ is generally seen in politeness theory as a minimizer, it acts here
as a booster for the face-threat as it is the means by which the dragon
states explicitly his being more experienced in business than the
contestant.

D4 then presents himself as the animator of a jointly authored position ⫺ the dragons’: ‘you don’t even know what the hell you’re meant
to be telling us here’ (lines 10⫺11). The intensifying adverb ‘even’ serves
to generate a conventional implicature ⫺ it acts as a presuppositional
trigger, implying that the hearer (the contestant) should know what he is
expected to say in the pitch. D4’s contribution is offered as a voice-over,
synced with a camera medium-long range shot of the five dragons looking positively unimpressed. Finally, D4 shifts footing once more to become the single author and animator of his coup de grace: ‘(2.0) I’m out’
(line 11). Note both the pause preceding it and the camera homing in on
him once more at this point. The latter effectively acts as a semiotic
illocutionary force indicating device (IFID), heightening the force of the
dragon’s withdrawal through visual foregrounding.
Intention in the dragons’ face-threatening behaviour is displayed in
(2) ⫺ itself illustrative of the corpus in this respect ⫺ through both the
dragons’ own use of (para)language/non-verbal behaviour and a quick
succession of camera angles that capture and maximize reactions to facethreat. The intended message to the viewing audience is thus jointly constructed in the above example by the dragons and the programme producers/camera crew. The dragons’ interventions contain their own IFIDs
but the camera work/editing semiotically boosts the force of these IFIDs.
It is also orchestrated through the use of off-screen commentary, which
is strategically synchronized with visual devices and supportive of the
dragons’ and the presenter’s stance.
4.1. The ‘anatomical workings’ of impoliteness containing sequences
in Dragons’ Den
In order to examine the discursive performance of impoliteness in Dragons’ Den, all fifty-six sequences were initially coded drawing on Bousfield’s (2007, 2008) taxonomy of discourse beginnings, middles and ends
in impoliteness containing exchanges. This taxonomy provides a summary of response options to a “triggering event” or “offending situation”. Following Culpeper et al.’s (2003) notion of the triggering event ⫺
itself developed from Jay (1992) ⫺ Bousfield (2007, 2008) defines an
offending situation as any phenomenon (action, event, language use, or
such like) treated as responsible for offending face, and thereby triggering an impoliteness containing exchange. The options available to interactants following an offending situation are then categorized by Bousfield (2007, 2008, also following to some extent Culpeper et al. 2003) as
follows: not to respond or to respond to the offending situation. If the
latter, then two further options arise: either to accept the face-attack or
to deny/counter it 11. In doing the latter, the speaker has two further

choices, either to offer a compromise or to counter the previous denial.
Countering, in turn, can be realized offensively and/or defensively. These
options effectively map out how impoliteness containing exchanges may
develop, i. e., their discourse middles. In addition, impoliteness containing exchanges may end in one of the following ways: submitting to the
opponent, dominant third-party intervention, compromise, stand-off
and withdrawal (Bousfield 2007, 2008).
In Dragons’ Den, antecedent events triggering an FTA were largely
perceived to have been committed by contestants, either during the pitch
or the negotiation phase. Within the latter, the dragons tended to treat
as offensive the contestants’ perceived failure to provide the requested
information. Less frequently, the dragons also treated as offensive the
contestants’ attempts to challenge the dragons’ questions/assessments.
The contestants’ behaviour was at times constructed as (potentially) offensive through the presenter’s off-screen commentary, too, as (3) illustrates.

Table 1 shows the number of discourse moves after an offending situation in the short sequences in Dragons’ Den. In these sequences, the
dragons were always shown to be countering a perceived offending situation by means of an offensive move. At this point, over half of the
contestants (thirty-six occurrences) were ‘silenced’ by means of a camera
cut to a different part of the interaction synched with a presenter’s voiceover12. In the remaining thirty-three instances, the contestants were

shown to accept the dragon’s counter offensive move (n ⫽ 12/17.4 %),
to deny it with a defensive move (n ⫽ 14/20.21 %), to offer a compromise
(n ⫽ 2/2.9 %) or to remain silent (n ⫽ 5/7.3 %). Of the fourteen instances
of contestants’ defensive counter moves, five were met with a further
offensive counter-move from the dragons before a presenter voice-over
(and therefore a camera cut to a different part of the interaction) was
inserted. The remaining eleven instances of contestants’ defensive counter
moves were immediately followed by a presenter voice-over. As for discourse ends, in all but eleven of the forty-five short sequences the final
move (last speaker turn) was made by a dragon. These discourse ends
thus projected an interactional power imbalance between the participant
categories ‘contestant’ and ‘dragon’, especially since they generally contained face-aggravating behaviour, such as dismissive remarks alongside
the dragons’ decision not to invest in the contestants’ product. Similarly
to the confrontational closings between hosts and callers in radio talk
shows examined by Hutchby (1996: 102⫺107), the “‘power of the last
word’ [was] instantiated as an interactional resource” to further construct the contestant-dragon asymmetry in the discourse ends of Dragons’ Den.
A similar discourse structure was found to underlie long sequences
containing impoliteness in the corpus, as Table 2 shows.

Impoliteness exchanges within long sequences in my data arose from
perceived offending situations caused predominantly by the contestants.
On the whole, the dragons were shown performing counter moves of,
mainly, an offensive nature (n ⫽ 186/93.47 %) and, occasionally, a defensive nature (n ⫽ 13/6.53 %). As for the contestants, in the middle stages
of these sequences, they were portrayed as accepting (n ⫽ 26/18.18 %),
not responding (either being silent (n ⫽ 28/19.59 %) or being silenced
through voice-over [n ⫽ 20/13.99 %]), or defensively countering the dragons (n ⫽ 53/37.04 %). Contestants were also shown at times countering

the dragons offensively (n ⫽ 14/9.8 %), which led to these moves becoming new offending situations. Discourse ends in these long sequences
differed from their short counterparts in that they encompassed the explicit signalling of the end of the interaction by each dragon. This was
typically achieved through small variations of the dragons’ formula ‘I’m
out’, followed at times by the contestants’ immediate reaction, and then
the presenter’s voice-over.
4.2. Impoliteness strategies in Dragons’ Den
The next step in the IP study was to establish whether there were any
patterns regarding the linguistic realization of impoliteness in the corpus.
This entailed coding of all the transcripts for impoliteness strategies.
Owing to space limitations, in this section I focus on patterns within the
main discourse move types in the dragons’ and the contestants’ contributions: offensive and defensive moves, respectively. The results of the coding are presented in Tables 3 and 4. More than one output strategy was
identified within most moves, hence the different totals for moves and
strategies in these tables.
The strategies listed in these tables draw upon both Culpeper’s (1996)
and Culpeper et al.’s (2003) taxonomy of impoliteness output strategies,
and Bousfield’s (2007, 2008) subsequent refinements. Although their
work did not seek to provide a quantitative index of (in)frequency of
given strategies, one can track their “markedness” in their contexts of
use. Thus Bousfield (2007, 2008) identified three strategies from Culpeper (1996) not realized in his corpus, namely “use obscure or secretive
language”, “invade the other’s space ⫺ literally or metaphorically” and
“put the other’s indebtedness on record” (Culpeper et al. 2003). Of these,
only “use obscure or secretive language” was also absent in the Dragons’
Den data.
More interesting than degrees of “markedness” in the Dragons’ Den
corpus per se is the recurring nature of certain linguistic realizations of

impoliteness in broadcast contexts involving interaction between ‘experts’ (e. g., the dragons, presenters, army camp trainers, celebrity chefs)
and ‘laity’ (e. g., contestants, army cadets, apprentice chefs). Thus, all
the strategies in Table 3 featured also in previous studies on impoliteness
in reality television and within interactions between participants of different discursive categories ⫺ namely experts and laity. Two such strategies, moreover, were particularly salient within the experts’ discourse in
Dragons’ Den, namely: “condescend, scorn, ridicule” and “hinder/block”.
While covered in previous studies, and as Bousfield (2008: 115) insightfully notes, the “condescend, scorn or ridicule” strategy remains a
bit of an analytic mystery in that little is known about the type of power
(moral, authoritative or otherwise) that may be involved in its realization. In the Dragons’ Den corpus, the dragons routinely performed explicit face-threatening acts in which they ridiculed the contestants and
emphasized their relative power over them. In less than a quarter of the
occurrences of this strategy, the kind of power imbalance being deliberately exploited by the dragons involved ridiculing the contestants’ claims
of a moral high ground: trying to create a product that would help the
environment, seeking to give back to his/her community and so forth. In
the majority of cases, ridiculing came through contrasting the dragons’
qualifications and/or successful capitalist ventures to both the contestants’
exaggerated claims to business acumen and their inability to do a sales
pitch. In doing so, the dragons combined power in discourse with power
behind discourse (Fairclough 1989). The latter revealed power relations
that are constitutive of social interactions and societies, such as access
to business opportunities, knowledge and expertise levels.
The strategy “hinder/block” was only realized in the Dragons’ Den in
its communicative dimension, that is, through the dragons either stopping a contestant from taking a turn on the conversational floor (turn
denials) or preventing him/her from completing his/her turn (interruptions). Interruptions were the most typical realization of the “hinder/
block” strategy, occurred mainly around the negotiation phase of the
den and often alongside the strategy “seek disagreement/avoid agreement”14.
Coding of discourse move types produced by the contestants revealed
their defensive nature (cf. Table 1 and Table 2). In order to ascertain
whether or not such moves fitted any linguistic realization patterns,
Bousfield’s (2007, 2008) categorization of strategies for defensive moves
was applied to this part of the corpus (See Table 4).
Over half of the defensive counter-moves by contestants were realized
via the “offer an account-explain” strategy and there were just six occurrences of the potentially more face-aggravating “direct contradiction”
strategy. Contestants may well have defended their products and ideas

in more forceful ways than those suggested by the figures in Table 4.
However, in the broadcast sequences, they were engaged in the impossible task of defending what the dragons continuously regarded as indefensible. The contestants were predominantly shown providing a number
of explanations that failed to satisfy the dragons. Admittedly, contestants
were also shown on fifteen occasions to communicatively hinder/block
their interlocutors, mainly through interruptions. However, seven of the
fifteen occurrences of this strategy were followed by a presenter voiceover, which glossed over the contestant’s prior turn before moving on to
a different part of the sequence.
5. Is it really impolite? Viewers’ reactions to face-threatening behaviour
in Dragons’ Den
In order to investigate viewer interpretation of the performance of faceattacking behaviour in Dragons’ Den, two clips were selected: clip 2 and
clip 3. They each included a dragon’s offensive counter move of the
“condescend, ridicule” and the “hinder/block” type, and contestants’ defensive moves of “offer an account-explain” and “hinder/block” type. In
addition, clip 3 showed a contestant performing a counter-offensive
move through the “sarcasm or mock politeness” strategy. Table 5 offers
a schematic representation of the performance of face-threat in the two
sequences shown in the video clips.
Other than one instance of “marked” (impolite) behaviour by the
contestant (move 9, clip 3) and Davis’ voice-over in the middle of clip 2
(move 8), the two clips were very similar. Both reproduced the clash
frequently found in ‘exploitative’ reality shows between cultural/personal
norms and local norms. The successive and unilateral use of offensive
behaviour displayed in clips 2 and 3 is generally seen as transgressing
general norms of politeness in Anglo-Saxon cultures (e. g., Lakoff 1989).
This is especially so if, as is the case in clips 2 and 3, such behaviour is
realized through condescension in spite of its being met with broadly

conciliatory turns from one’s co-interactant. Yet, local norms (i. e.,
norms in Dragons’ Den) allow, indeed rely on, precisely such behaviour.
How did, then, all the relevant parties interpret face-aggravation in
clips 2 and 3? Let us begin with contestant 2 and contestant 3. The
predominance of conciliatory moves on these contestants’ part may signal their feeling hurt by the dragons’ contributions but reacting in accordance to cultural norms, that is, seeking to minimize explicit disagreement and confrontation. At the same time, though, the contestants’
verbal reactions in moves 3 and 5 (clip 2) and 7 (clip 3) co-occurred with
body language that sent a conflicting message: smiling. Given the primacy generally assigned to non-verbal over verbal signs of communication in terms of believability (Lyons 1977; Richmond and McCroskey
2000), especially when the messages being simultaneously sent out by
verbal and non-verbal signs are contradictory (Hetch et al. 1999), it is
perhaps reasonable to suggest that these two contestants were aware of
local norms dictating the dragon’s behaviour and, hence, did not perceive it as impolite. I say ‘perhaps reasonable’ because of the performed
nature of the entire communicative context in which both the dragon’s
and the contestants’ behaviour was embedded.
What about the non-physically co-present yet main recipients of the
interaction? How did the respondents who took part in the IR study
interpret clips 2 and 3? Let us begin by considering the ratings yielded
by the questionnaire (Table 6).
The results above show that respondents generally agreed in their assessment. The contestant in clip 2 undoubtedly had the highest number
of 1- or 2-scores. This was despite this contestant being seen as responsible ⫺ judging from the dragons’ subsequent turns ⫺ for two offending
situations (moves 2 and 11). Respondents awarded a considerable
number of 3-scores, mainly to the dragon in clip 3 (52). In terms of
move and strategy types (Table 5), however, this dragon behaved nearly
identically in clip 2 and clip 3. This suggests, especially when examining
4- and 5-scores, that his performance was assessed alongside that of his

177

co-interactant in each clip. Respondents in fact strongly agreed in their
4- and 5-ratings, with the dragon in clip 2 and the contestant in clip 3
obtaining a considerable number of such scores. Agreement levels were
particularly high in relation to the contestant’s behaviour in clip 3, with
seventy-eight out of eighty-five respondents classing his behaviour as
impolite (21) or very impolite (57)16.
Clip 3 contained an instance of “marked” (impolite) behaviour on the
part of the contestant, namely the following sarcastic remark within an
offensive-counter move (move 9 in Table 5): ‘you’re looking at it [the
product] with the x-ray eyes of Superman’. This occurred after three
consecutive offensive counter-moves by D5, who kept ridiculing the
contestant’s product: ‘the Interflush’ ⫺ a device attached to the inside
handle of a toilet, and aimed at saving water when flushing. D5 described scornfully and in some detail the process of going to the toilet
and ‘having (.) to look at my shit while I go to the toilet afterwards …’
(move 2), ‘… when you go to the big toilet (.) you can’t wait to close
that top seat down (.) so I can’t (.) get my head round (.) watching (.)
as if it’s s- some form of ritual (.) being quite a proud moment’ (move
4) […] ‘with perhaps a little you know (xxx) you know yodel in the
background sort of saying it’s finished now and it’s all over and it’s gone
away’ (move 6). As he did so, the contestant accepted the face-threat:
‘mm ok’ (move 3). He also tried to present his views to no avail (‘[well
(.) I’d lik-], move 5), to offer an explanation for the product (… most
people look insid- look at the pan anyway to make sure it’s clear for the
next person …’, move 7) and to seek compromise (‘[to all the dragons]
d- does that make sense to anyone?’, move 7). It was however, the
contestant’s single use in move 9 of a counter-offensive move following
a further ridiculing remark by the dragon (move 8) that probably led to
the high number of 4- and 5-scores for him in this clip.
The questionnaire ratings, then, revealed a significant degree of agreement in the interpretation of certain type of face-threatening behaviour
as impolite, with isolated “marked” instances accounting for overall
scores and co-interactants’ behaviour influencing individual participant
scores. But what reasons were given by respondents for their ratings? In
other words, how did they characterize impolite or very impolite behaviour? Table 7 lists the descriptors for 4- and 5-scores with an occurrence
frequency > 5. Number of occurrences is given between brackets.
Respondents produced a higher number of, and more varied, reasons
for their 4- and 5-scores for the dragon than for the contestants. This
may owe to the ritualized performance of media personalities in ‘exploitative’ reality shows, which may make it easier to typify. As for the actual
terms used to describe impolite behaviour for either the contestants or
the dragon, one must bear in mind that the results presented in Table 7

are limited to responses given by 85 participants, with very specific sociodemographic characteristics. These results are, therefore, clearly not
amenable to being generalized to any larger/different groups. Nevertheless, they broadly fit existing taxonomies of impoliteness strategies.
The strategy “condescend, scorn, ridicule ⫺ emphasize your relative
power” (Culpeper 1996: 358; Bousfield 2008: 114⫺115) featured saliently
in the responses given regarding the dragon’s and the contestants’ discourse. Thus, the comments ‘patronizing’ (n ⫽ 41) and ‘belittles the
contestant’ (n ⫽ 22) topped the list for the dragon and ‘arrogant’ (which
is a way to emphasize relative power) was the second most frequently
given reason in the case of the contestants (n ⫽ 17), with ‘patronizing’
also featuring here, even if considerably less often (n ⫽ 6). This result is
surprising as regards the contestants’ discourse, for clips 2 and 3 contained seven condescending moves, all of which were made by the
dragon (see Table 5).
The strategy “sarcasm/mock politeness” (Culpeper 1996: 356; Bousfield 2008: 118⫺122) proved popular, too, in the respondents’ reasons
for rating both the contestants (n ⫽ 38) and the dragon (‘sarcastic’
n ⫽ 18 ⫹ ‘mocking contestant’ n ⫽ 11) as being impolite/very impolite.
Interestingly, only two sarcastic moves were performed in the clips ⫺
one by the dragon in clip 3 (move 9) and one by the contestant in clip 2
(move 11). Use of “sarcasm/mock politeness” was, then, not only saliently impolite for the respondents in relation to the programme as a
whole but to the discourse of the contestants.
A number of responses in Table 7, moreover, may be seen to tie in
with either Culpeper’s (1996) “invade the other’s space” strategy or

179

Bousfield’s (2008: 127⫺131) originally related “hinder/block ⫺ physically (block passage), communicatively (deny turn/interrupt)” strategy.
Culpeper (1996: 358) states that invading the other’s space may be realized “literally (e. g., positioning yourself closer to the other than the relationship permits) or metaphorically (e. g., ask for, or speak about information which is too intimate given the relationship).” In my IR study,
this strategy may have been manifest (at the metaphorical level) in the
response type “pressurises the contestant” (n ⫽ 18).
Once again, it is significant that out of the three instances in clips 2
and 3 of the “hinder communicatively” strategy, only one was performed
by a contestant (clip 3, move 5). Moreover, this was, in fact, a failed
attempt at doing so.
Some respondents wrote ‘insulting …’ in their questionnaires in relation to the contestants (n ⫽ 6) and, especially, the dragon (n ⫽ 42). The
clips contained no instances of use of “inappropriate identity markers”
(Culpeper 1996: 357; Bousfield 2008: 106⫺108), which could be logically
seen as a realization of insulting behaviour. Such written comments,
therefore, may reflect the strategy “‘explicitly” associate the other with
a negative aspect ⫺ personalize, use the pronouns “‘I’ and ‘you’” (Culpeper 1996: 358). However, no actual occurrences of this strategy were
indentified in the process of coding the two clips either. This seems to
indicate that references to insulting behaviour were ‘lay’ (first order)
labels for the notion of impoliteness. Other response types that were
seemingly used as being tantamount to impoliteness per se were ‘blunt’
(n ⫽ 17, dragon), ‘abrupt’ (n ⫽ 8, contestants), ‘bitchy’ (n ⫽ 16, contestants)
and ‘rude’ (n ⫽ 13, contestants / n ⫽ 16, dragon). It is worth emphasizing in respect of the last two descriptors in particular the absence of, on
the one hand, any move that could be analytically categorized as doing
“being ‘bitchy’” in the entire corpus and, on the other, the absence of
swearing, use of abusive or profane language in the two clips (cf. Culpeper’s [1996: 358] “use of taboo words” strategy).
Lastly, and in terms of cultural vis-à-vis local norms, the respondents
tapped principally into the transgression of the former. Thus they referred to ‘manifestations’ of impoliteness that are not restricted to a
given situation or context in the UK, such as insulting, ridiculing (patronizing), communicative hindering (interruptions, pressurizing) of
others, being sarcastic, and so forth. However, the respondents also
made references to local norms at play, that is, to norms expected to
be followed within the context of the reality show Dragons’ Den. Such
references were explicit ⫺ if indiscriminating ⫺ in the case of the dragon’s behaviour in the clips: ‘unnecessarily impolite for the programme’
(n ⫽ 12). They were also implicit, but more specific, for certain aspects of

the contestants’ (‘defensive’, n ⫽ 15) and the dragon’s (‘no constructive
criticism’, n ⫽ 21/‘negative’, n ⫽ 11) performance.
There were further references, in fact, to transgression of local norms
in the respondents’ questionnaires but they exhibited an occurrence frequency lower than 5. For the contestants, these included ‘insisting on
getting his point across in negotiating sale’ (n ⫽ 4), ‘tone of voice inappropriate for sales pitch’ (n ⫽ 4), ‘tries to make dragon look stupid’
(n ⫽ 3) and ‘being unprofessional in the studio’ (n ⫽ 2). For the dragons,
they included comments such as: ‘purposefully impolite for entertainment’ (n ⫽ 4), ‘contradicting contestant’ (n ⫽ 4), ‘distracts the contestant’
(n ⫽ 3), ‘appears disinterested and bored with contestant’ (n ⫽ 2), and
‘exploiting contestant’ (n ⫽ 2). These references to different local norms
suggest quite a nuanced understanding of the factors underpinning the
realization and interpretation of face-threat in the clips.
6. Conclusions
In an article published in the first issue of the Journal of Politeness Research, Holmes and Schnurr (2005) argue for a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches to the study of politeness in workplace
interaction. Qualitative approaches, their argument goes, can yield (and
have done so) nuanced, dynamic analyses. But quantitative analyses of
large size databases can successfully capture “some of the norms and
patterns of different communities of practice, against which the behaviours of individuals can be more relevantly interpreted.” (Holmes and
Schnurr 2005: 144).
In this study I have drawn on a sizeable database to allow for patterns
concerning the performance of talk containing maximally offensive facethreat in ‘exploitative’ reality shows to be revealed. These patterns provide a background for understanding the interpretation of impoliteness
by those involved in the participation framework of this form of broadcast talk. The IP study consisted of discourse analytic transcriptions of
five hours of interaction in Dragons’ Den, systematic coding of which
showed a pattern of lay subordination to expertise both in terms of
discourse moves and impoliteness strategies performed by dragons and
contestants.
The picture that undoubtedly emerged from the analysis of the discourse structure of, and strategies in, impoliteness containing sequences
in Dragons’ Den was one of controlled performance of interactional
power (controlled because it often resulted from editing practices at
post-production level). Contestants in this show were portrayed as defensive but ultimately accepting the dragons’ face-threatening behaviour,
often via endless attempts at explaining or accounting for their ideas.
The dragons were portrayed as systematically countering perceived of-

fending situations by attacking the contestants’ face, often through condescension and regardless of the actual severity of the offending situation
(e. g., failure to provide a set of figures in [2])). The interactional subordination of laity to expertise evinced by patterns emerging from the IP
study runs contrary to the alleged revalorization of lay knowledge in
participatory (reality) television (e. g., Livingstone and Lunt 1994). However, it is symptomatic of the current “rise of ‘spectacular incivility’ ⫺
of incivility-as-spectacle” (Lorenzo-Dus 2009: 100). Rather than being
a case of frequent instances of highly conflictive and maximally facethreatening talk on television, this designates the “discursive processes
and practices whereby such behaviour is explicitly staged for its entertainment value ⫺ hence its purchase in a medium that depends on viewer
gratification for its survival.” (Lorenzo-Dus 2009: 187).
In addition to identifying an interactional power imbalance between
the expert-lay person in the studio, the IP study also highlighted an
additional source of power ⫺ one that operates at the broadcast level of
talk articulation (since it is effected at post-production time) and is embodied by the trusted figure of the show’s presenter. Sequences containing impoliteness in the IP corpus were discursively orchestrated around
a number of voice-overs which set the scene (against the contestants), dictated its development (for example, by determining the length of the discourse middle segments) and, importantly, closed off impoliteness containing sequences in such a way that the dragons invariably had the
upper hand. Although not always explicitly face-threatening, such voiceovers exerted a form of interactional power over both the contestants
(whose contributions were often critically framed) and the viewing audience (who was also offered an interpretative frame for the contestants’
discourse).
The eighty-five respondents who completed the questionnaire for the
IR study, for their part, cannot be seen as a sufficiently large cohort to
make generalizations regarding viewer interpretation of impoliteness in
such a popular programme as Dragons’ Den. Nevertheless, as a group,
they exhibited considerable degrees of homogeneity in their interpretative
patterns. Three aspects of the findings of the IR study are particularly
revealing. Firstly, isolated instances of marked (impolite) behaviour ⫺
such as contestant’s single sarcastic offensive move in clip 3 ⫺ seemingly
determined overall scores of impoliteness for this speaker. Secondly, individual participant scores were likely influenced by co-interactants’ behaviour within a given sequence. Thirdly, respondents’ comments on
their reasons for awarding 4- and 5-scores revealed the importance of
both (rather than of either-or) local and cultural norms.
The IR study, of course, relied on first order understandings of impoliteness. However, it sought neither to “reify” a lay perspective on impo-

liteness nor to “elevate it to the status of a theory of (im)politeness.”
(Haugh 2007: 311). As some of the descriptions in Table 7 showed, lay
language users (the respondents) may lack the necessary metalinguistic
skills to articulate their evaluations of (im)politeness (O’Keefe 1989).
Yet, by exploring interpretations of the performance of impoliteness by
all intended recipients, light can be shed into current debates over what
analytic frameworks and conceptual apparatus may further our understanding of impoliteness across a range of (un)mediated contexts.
Finally, and related to the above, first order interpretations of impoliteness in this study were offered alongside exploration of the discursive
structure and realization of impoliteness in the clips being examined.
Such exploration was guided by the second order approach to impoliteness that underpinned the design of the IP study as a whole. By combining these two approaches and study foci, therefore, I hope to have established precisely the kind of interpretative relevance that authors against
purely first order approaches to (im)politeness advocate. A crucial aim
of such interpretative relevance is, as Haugh (2007: 311) puts it, to ensure
that the “analyst’s interpretation is consonant or analogous with the
participant’s understanding” ⫺ in this case both the co-present and the
absent participants.

Notes
1. The author would like to express her thanks to the two anonymous reviewers for
their comments and to the research students who helped trial parts of this study.
The usual caveats apply.
2. See, for example, Ulijn and Xianglin (1995), Culpeper (1996, 1998, 2005, 2008),
Kienpointner (1997), Mullany (2002), Blas-Arroyo (2003), Haugh (2003, 2007),
Bolı́var (2005), Mills (2005), Spencer-Oatey (2005), Cashman (2006), Bousfield
(2007, 2008), Brenes Peña (2007), Locher and Bousfield (2008), Tracy (2008) and.
Garcés-Conejos Blitvich (2009 [this issue]).
3. While accepting that the term “overhearing audience” has become widespread and
for that reason also convenient in much media discourse research, Hutchby (2006:
167) suggests replacing it with “distributed recipients” on account of the fact that
talk on radio and television belongs to a “broader category of mediated and distributed talk-in-interaction” (original emphasis).
4. See Appendix for transcription conventions.
5. Kienpointner (2008: 245) lists three features of impoliteness/rudeness, namely:
(i) it “destabilizes the personal relationship of the interacting individuals […];
(ii) “… it creates or maintains an emotional atmosphere of mutual irreverence
and antipathy, which primarily serves egocentric interests”; and (iii) “is partially
determined by concepts of power, distance, emotional attitudes and cost-benefit
scales which are generally accepted in a speech community.”
6. See also Mills (2003) and Watts (2003), both of whom call for a similar approach
within their discursive ⫺ or postmodern ⫺ view of (im)politeness.
7. For similar views, see amongst others Harris (2001), Pérez de Ayala (2001), Lorenzo-Dus (2007) and Mullany (2008). The term “community of practice” was
first coined by Lave and Wenger (1991) in their investigation of informal, naturally-occurring contexts of talk. Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (1992: 464) subsequently defined a community of practice as: “an aggregate of people who come
together around mutual engagement in an endeavour. Ways of doing things, ways
of talking, beliefs, values, power relations ⫺ in short, practices ⫺ emerge in the
course of this mutual endeavour.”
8. The potential impact of gender was not controlled in this study, although it clearly
remains an important variable to be explored in future investigations.
9. In this paper interactional sequences are analytic categories pre-determined by the
nature of the data used in the IP study. They designate coverage of a communicative exchange around one business idea between one or two contestants and up
to five dragons.
10. The term ‘dispreferred’ is used here in a sociopragmatic rather than in a conversation analysis-specialist sense. For a discussion of the interrelationship between the
two see Bousfield (2008: 236⫺240).

11. Bousfield uses both terms ⫺ ‘counter’ (2008: 203) and ‘deny’ (2008: 219) ⫺ for
the same discourse move. In order to avoid confusion with one of the two further
moves stemming from it, which he also terms ‘counter’, ‘deny’ will be used in
this paper.
12. This move type was coded and counted against the contestants, rather than
against a third participatory category (the presenter), because in the IR study
respondents were only asked to rate contestants and dragons.
13. Note that strategies either not realized in the corpus or having a frequency lower
that 5 % of the total have been grouped in the category ‘other’. The following
strategies were not realized in the corpus: “use obscure or secretive language” and
“enforce role shift”. Strategies in the dragons’ discourse with less than 5 % occurrence included: “ignore, snub the other” (n ⫽ 8), “make the other feel uncomfortable” (n ⫽ 7), “disassociate from the other” (n ⫽ 6), “exclude the other from an
activity” (n ⫽ 4), “frighten or threaten” (n ⫽ 4), “use taboo words” (n ⫽ 3), “use
derogatory terms of address” (n ⫽ 3), “use inappropriate identity markers” (n ⫽
2), “put the other’s indebtedness on record” (n ⫽ 2) and “invade the other’s space”
(n ⫽ 1).
14. Only instances of ‘confrontational’ or ‘hostile’ interrupting were considered. A
handful of ‘supportive’ interruptions were also found but not coded under this
strategy. The ‘supportive’ nature of the latter was determined by their content
(e. g., explicitly affiliative statements) and/or the contestant’s immediate reaction
(e. g., thanking).
15. Strategies occurring in less than 5 % of the total within the contestants’ discourse
were: “abrogation” (n ⫽ 2); “ignore” (n ⫽ 6); “opt out on record” (n ⫽ 1).
16. The contestant in clip 3 was the only participant to obtain more 5- than 4-scores
within the impolite-very impolite cluster. The dragon in clip 2, the second ‘highest
scorer’ for impoliteness in the clips, received thirty-eight scores of 4 and only
twelve of 5.
