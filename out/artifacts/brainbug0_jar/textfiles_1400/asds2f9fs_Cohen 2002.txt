n this paper, we use data from the Carnegie Mellon Survey on industrial R&D to evaluate
for the U.S. manufacturing sector the inﬂuence of “public” (i.e., university and government
R&D lab) research on industrial R&D, the role that public research plays in industrial R&D,
and the pathways through which that effect is exercised. We ﬁnd that public research is critical to industrial R&D in a small number of industries and importantly affects industrial R&D
across much of the manufacturing sector. Contrary to the notion that university research
largely generates new ideas for industrial R&D projects, the survey responses demonstrate
that public research both suggests new R&D projects and contributes to the completion of
existing projects in roughly equal measure overall. The results also indicate that the key channels through which university research impacts industrial R&D include published papers and
reports, public conferences and meetings, informal information exchange, and consulting.
We also ﬁnd that, after controlling for industry, the inﬂuence of public research on industrial
R&D is disproportionately greater for larger ﬁrms as well as start-ups.

Introduction

to applied research and then to development and
commercialization. In this traditional view, public
research—particularly university research—proceeds
upstream and independently of technological development, which, however, draws from the pool of
research results. A richer characterization of the innovation process has been developed over the past two
decades by scholars such as Gibbons and Johnston
(1975), Kline and Rosenberg (1986), Nelson (1990)
and von Hippel (1988), among others. This conception is of a more interactive relationship where public research sometimes leads the development of new
technologies, and sometimes focuses on problems
posed by prior developments or buyer feedback. In
this view, industrial innovation emerges from a complicated process where fundamental research need
not play an initiating role, nor, at times, any role. In
this study, we both build on and probe this perspec-

This paper reports ﬁndings from the Carnegie Mellon Survey on Industrial R&D on the contributions of
university and government research labs—what we
will call public research—to industrial innovation. By
advancing our understanding of the contribution of
public research to industrial R&D, we hope to deepen
our understanding of the determinants of technological change broadly, and speak to assumptions that
have guided policy discussions over the past two
decades concerning the economic impact of public
research.
Understanding the impact of public research on
industrial R&D is central to understanding the innovation process itself. The so-called “linear model”
of innovation, reﬂected most notably in Vannevar
Bush’s (1945) Science—The Endless Frontier, conceived
of industrial innovation as proceeding from basic

tive by considering the contribution of public research
to technical advance in the context of the different
sources and types of knowledge that may stimulate
and inform industrial R&D.
In the post–World War II period, the presumption
that basic research proceeds independently of, but
often drives, technological developments strongly colored policymakers’ commitments to public research
generally (even though public research also encompasses a good deal of applied research and development). Over the past two decades, motivated by ﬁscal constraints and stiffening international economic
competition, numerous policymakers have, however,
effectively eschewed the linear model as they have
encouraged universities and government labs to
embrace the cause of technology commercialization.
Reﬂecting the sentiment that public research is too
distant from industry in the majority of industries
(with the notable exception of biomedical research),
policymakers have called on universities and government R&D labs to make their science and engineering more relevant to industry’s needs. The National
Science Foundation has embraced this mission with
the creation of the Science and Technology Centers,
the Engineering Research Centers and other programs
that tie government support of university research to
industrial participation. In order to stimulate regional
economic development, numerous state governments
have followed suit. Federal policymakers have even
changed the nation’s intellectual property policy to
increase incentives to commercialize public research
(e.g., the Bayh-Dole Amendment).
In this paper, we use data from the 1994 Carnegie
Mellon Survey (CMS) of Industrial R&D to characterize the extent and nature of the contribution of public research to industrial R&D. We ﬁrst assess how
public research stands relative to other sources of
information affecting industrial R&D.1 In this context, we report on how public research tends to be
used in industrial R&D labs. Second, we consider the
overall importance of public research, as well as that
of speciﬁc ﬁelds of basic and applied research and

problem solving in industrial R&D.

engineering. Third, we consider the importance of
the different pathways through which public research
may impact industrial R&D, including publications,
informal interactions, consulting, and the hiring of
university graduates. Finally, we consider what roles
different kinds of ﬁrms (e.g., large versus small and
start-ups versus established ﬁrms) play in bridging
public research and industrial R&D.
In brief, our data suggest that public research has a
substantial impact on industrial R&D in a few industries, particularly pharmaceuticals, and is generally
important across a broad segment of the manufacturing sector. Like previous studies, we ﬁnd that the contribution of public research to industrial R&D varies
across industries. The uses of public research are also
observed to vary. Consistent with a more interactive
conception of the innovation process, our data show
that public research is used at least as frequently to
address existing problems and needs as to suggest
new research efforts. The most important channels for
accessing public research appear to be the public and
personal channels (such as publications, conferences,
and informal interactions), rather than, say, licenses
or cooperative ventures. Finally, we ﬁnd that large
ﬁrms are more likely to use public research than small
ﬁrms, with the exception that start-up ﬁrms also make
particular use of public research, especially in pharmaceuticals.

Background

Two decades ago, scholars concerned with the study
of technological advance had a limited understanding of the impact on technical advance of the kind
of research that was conducted at universities and
government labs. The discussion at that time tended
to involve an attempt to sort out “demand pull”
from “opportunity push” as factors inﬂuencing technological advance, where “opportunity push” was
typically intended to capture the impact of new scientiﬁc and technological knowledge. Research that
was “upstream” relative to commercial application
was seen as key to initiating new inventive efforts.
Since that time, most scholars have come to understand that this view—the linear model—does not adequately characterize the role of fundamental understandings emerging from science or engineering.

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

Research by Gibbons and Johnston (1975), Klevorick
et al. (l995), Mansﬁeld (1991), Nelson (1990), Rosenberg (1992), Mowery and Rosenberg (l979), Rosenberg and Nelson (1994), Feller (1990), Hounshell
(1996), Narin et al. (l997), and others have advanced
our understanding of the role of public—particularly
university—research in technological advance beyond
the old debate about demand pull versus opportunity push. From this research, we learned that, while
upstream research can spawn new research projects,
downstream technical advances can also instigate
and shape upstream research. Moreover, innovative
efforts are often guided by perceptions of need and
demand, although more fundamental understandings
will often then shape how and with what success
those efforts proceed.
As scholars were rethinking the linear model, policymakers’ presumption of the social value of public research was weakening. In this context, empirical economists began assessing the contribution of
academic research to technical advance. Little consensus has emerged, however, on the extent or nature
of that contribution. The “Yale survey”—which laid
the groundwork for the current study—found that
ﬁrms in the majority of industries reported that the
direct contribution of research conducted by universities and government R&D labs to their R&D activities
was slight compared to sources within the “industrial
chain” (i.e., ﬁrms in the industry itself, suppliers, and
buyers). Science in general was also widely reported
to be relatively more important. Nelson (1986) and
Klevorick et al. (1995) interpreted their ﬁndings to
suggest that recent university research (i.e., conducted
in the prior 10–15 years) had little direct effect on
industrial R&D outside of a few technologies such as
drugs, other areas of medicine, sophisticated organic
chemical products, and some areas of electronics.
They argued that the impact of university research
was nonetheless substantial, though indirect; that university research and science used in most industries’ inventive efforts tended to be relatively mature
and typically exercised inﬂuence through the more
applied sciences and engineering ﬁelds or via the
training of industry’s scientists and engineers.
Using other methods and data sources, Mansﬁeld
(1991), Jaffe (1989), Adams (1990), and Narin et al.
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

(1997) added other elements to the evolving picture.
Mansﬁeld’s survey research study of 76 ﬁrms spanning information processing, electrical equipment and
instruments, drug, metal, and oil ﬁrms suggested that
10 percent of new products and processes would have
been delayed a year or more in the absence of academic research conducted within the prior 15 years.
While relatively small, this impact was large in absolute terms, conceivably denying industry $24 billion
in sales in 1985. Estimating the elasticity of corporate
patenting with respect to university research to be as
high as 0.6, Jaffe (1989) judged the inﬂuence of university R&D to be important overall and strongest in
the drug industry. On the basis of a regression analysis of bibliometric data, Adams similarly ﬁnds the
effects of academic R&D on manufacturing productivity to be important, though, in the case of academic
research in the basic sciences, to take approximately
20 years to become manifest. More recently, using
ﬁrms’ patent citations to the scientiﬁc and engineering literature, Narin et al. (1997) concluded that the
linkages between industrial R&D and current public research (conducted in either academia or government labs in the prior 10 years) grew dramatically
between the late-1980s and early-to-mid-1990s.
Thus, Klevorick et al. (1995) ﬁnd the direct impact
of recent university research in most industries to be
small when assessed relative to other sources of information or scientiﬁc knowledge generally. Not necessarily inconsistent with this evaluation, others ﬁnd the
impact to be substantial when assessed as elasticities
or in absolute terms.
Further complicating the picture is the deepening of ties between public research institutions—
particularly universities—and industry over the last
two decades that may signify a recent change in
the impact of public research. For example, U.S.
patents granted to universities increased from 589
in 1985 to 3,151 in 1998 (National Science Board
2000). During this same period (and especially during the 1980s), industry funding of university research
increased from $630 million to $1.896 billion (NSB
2000). Moreover, ties between industry and universities have generally deepened, as reﬂected in the
60% growth in university-industry R&D centers in
the 1980s (Cohen et al. 1998) and the more than
3

eightfold increase in university technology transfer
ofﬁces between 1980 and 1995 (Association of University Technology Managers 1999).
Notwithstanding the different frames of reference and perspectives on the contribution of public research to technical advance, some understandings are reasonably solid. For example, there is broad
consensus that while the linear model may capture
key aspects of the innovation process in some settings, its applicability is limited. Previous studies also
raise several questions. To the extent that academic
research impacts industrial R&D, what are the channels of that impact? Also, how do industrial R&D labs
actually use public research? What is the effect of ﬁrm
size on the exploitation of public research, and do
start-ups provide an important bridge between public research and industrial R&D? Using the CMS data,
we now try to address these and related questions. At
the outset, we note that our examination of the extent
and nature of the contribution of public research to
industrial R&D is incomplete. The innovation process
is complex, often subtle and varies across industries,
technologies, and over time in ways that one survey
cannot hope to reﬂect fully.

Data

The data come from a survey of R&D managers
administered in 1994. The population sampled are all
the R&D units located in the U.S. conducting R&D in
manufacturing industries as part of a manufacturing
ﬁrm. The sample was randomly drawn from the eligible labs listed in Bowker’s Directory of American
Research and Technology (1994) or belonging to ﬁrms
listed in Standard and Poor’s COMPUSTAT, stratiﬁed
by three-digit SIC industry.2 We sampled 3,240 labs,
and received 1,478 responses, yielding an unadjusted
response rate of 46% and an adjusted response rate
of 54%.3 Our survey data are combined with published data on ﬁrm sales and employees from COM2

We also oversampled Fortune 500 ﬁrms.

3

The results of a nonrespondent survey showed that 28% of nonrespondents were ineligible for the survey because they either did no
manufacturing or did no R&D. Excluding these from our denominator, as well as respondents who should not have been sampled,
yields an adjusted response rate of 54% of eligible respondents.

PUSTAT, Dun and Bradstreet, Moody’s, Ward’s, and
similar sources.
The survey provides several measures of the inﬂuence of public research on industrial R&D that allow
us to examine different dimensions of that inﬂuence.
As noted above, much of the literature relevant to this
paper focuses on the impact of university research
on industrial R&D. In contrast, we ask respondents
to consider the impact of research produced by universities and government research institutes and labs.
Citations on U.S. patents to the scientiﬁc and engineering literature provided by the National Science
Board (1998) suggest, however, that of public research
institutions, universities dominate in their impact on
industrial R&D, suggesting, in turn, that our ﬁndings
characterize predominantly the impact of university
research.4
For the analysis in this paper, we restricted our
sample to ﬁrms whose focus industry was in the manufacturing sector and were not foreign owned, yielding a sample of 1,267 cases. This sample includes
ﬁrms ranging from less than 25 to over 100,000
employees, with annual sales ranging from less than
$1 million to over $60 billion. The median ﬁrm has
2,263 employees and annual sales of $412 million.
The average ﬁrm has 20,263 employees and sales of
$4.2 billion. The business units (deﬁned as a ﬁrm’s
activity in a speciﬁc industry) range from fewer than
10 employees to over 50,000, with annual sales from
zero to over $30 billion. The median business unit has
400 employees and $100 million in sales. The average business unit has 6,095 employees and sales of
$2.1 billion. The average R&D intensity (R&D dollars
divided by total sales) for the ﬁrms is 3.23%. Presented in Table 1, the size distribution of our ﬁrms
4
Citations on U.S. patents to the scientiﬁc and engineering literature provided by the National Science Board (1998) distinguish
between the inﬂuence on industrial R&D of university research
versus that conducted by government. As of 1994, patent citations
to publications originating from academia exceed those originating from the federal government by 5.7 times. This multiple varies,
however, across ﬁelds, from 4.9 in the combined ﬁelds of biomedical research, clinical medicine, and biology, to 8.4 in engineering
and technology, suggesting that the impact of university research
may be almost an order of magnitude greater than that of government research in industries outside the biomedical ﬁelds.

and business units, expressed in numbers of employees, shows that 35% of our sample are “small” ﬁrms
with less than 500 employees (and almost 18% have
fewer than 100 employees). Over half of our business
units have fewer than 500 employees.
In our survey, we asked R&D unit managers to
answer questions with reference to the “focus industry” of their R&D unit, deﬁned as the principal industry for which the unit was conducting its R&D.5 For
the purpose of presentation in the tables, our observations are grouped into 34 ISIC groups which are
aggregated at the two- or three-digit level and span
the manufacturing sector. For some analyses, we disaggregate our data more ﬁnely into 64 industries,
deﬁned roughly at the three-digit SIC level.

Sources of Knowledge Used in
Industrial R&D

We begin our analysis by examining the importance
of a broad range of information sources, of which
the R&D conducted in university and government
5
By asking respondents to answer questions in terms of a single,
identiﬁed industry, we reduce the measurement error that comes
from having ﬁrms’ responses reﬂect conditions in some ambiguous
combination of the several industries in which they may be active.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

R&D labs is one. We asked respondents to indicate
whether information from a source either suggested
new R&D projects or contributed to the completion of
existing projects over the prior three years. For each of
these two functions, we listed a broad range of possible knowledge sources, including university and government R&D labs (i.e., “public research”), competitors, customers, suppliers, consultants/contract R&D
ﬁrms, joint or cooperative ventures, and the ﬁrm’s
own manufacturing operations.
The “linear model” suggests that upstream
research—and hence the institutions of public
research that conduct much of it—should play an initiating role as a key source of the ideas leading to
industrial innovation. Our results suggest, however,
that a preponderance of industrial R&D projects are
initiated in response to information from buyers (consistent with von Hippel 1988) or from the ﬁrm’s own
manufacturing operations. In virtually all industries,
our respondents listed buyers and the ﬁrm’s own
manufacturing operations as the predominant sources
suggesting new projects, with 90% listing customers
and 74% listing the ﬁrm’s manufacturing operations.
Also, as shown in Figure 1, knowledge from public
research labs does not play the central role in suggesting new projects; 32% of the respondents list public research as such a source, and in the majority of
industries, public research plays only a modest role
in suggesting new projects. In a few industries, however, public research was rated as a relatively important stimulus to the initiation of new R&D projects.
With 58% of respondents reporting public research
as a source for new project ideas, the pharmaceutical industry is the most heavily inﬂuenced by public
research by this measure. For suggesting new projects,
public research is also relatively important in the
petroleum, steel, machine tool, semiconductor, and
aerospace industries, each with 50% or more of the
respondents reporting public research as a source of
new project ideas.
Figure 2 shows that the sources of information
contributing to R&D project completion is less concentrated than those suggesting R&D projects. No
one source so dominates as did buyers in the prior
case. Nonetheless, and consistent with the notion
that downstream needs and feedback often guide

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

industrial R&D (cf. Kline and Rosenberg 1986),
one source—namely the ﬁrm’s own manufacturing
operations—is more important than the others. About
78% of the respondents report that knowledge from
manufacturing operations contributes to R&D project
completion. The key role of manufacturing operations as a knowledge source is unsurprising given its
centrality to process innovation and the importance
of “manufacturability” for product innovation. The
impacts of buyers and suppliers are now comparable, with close to 60% of respondents reporting use of
each.
As noted above, the “linear model” of innovation
would suggest that upstream research should principally suggest new project ideas. We observe, however,
public research playing a slightly more important role
overall as a knowledge source for R&D project completion rather than for project initiation, with 36% of
respondents reporting public research as a source of
knowledge for this former function versus 32% for
the latter. This suggests that, at least as often as not,
public research provides the means to achieve some
technological goal, which itself emerges, if not from
the ﬁrm’s own R&D, then typically either from buyers’ or the ﬁrms’ own manufacturing operations. The
industries where public research is relatively important in helping ﬁrms to execute projects (i.e., with
scores exceeding 45%) include food, paper, drugs,
glass, search/navigation equipment, car/truck, and
aerospace. Of these industries, drugs, car/truck, and
aerospace score the highest, all with scores above 55%.
We observed above that the pharmaceutical industry stands out in the degree to which public research
both suggests new R&D projects and contributes to
R&D project completion. The pharmaceutical industry is also distinctive with regard to its sources of
knowledge. For example, in response to a follow-up
question about which of these sources was the most
important, the drug industry was the only one where
a majority of respondents did not list customers as
their most important source of new project ideas.6
Only 31% of drug industry respondents listed customers as the most important source—the least of
6

For the food industry, 49.45% chose customers.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

any industry (in contrast to 66% for the whole sample, p < 00001, using Wilcoxon rank sum test), though
20% listed public research as the most important (in
contrast to 3% for the whole sample, p < 00001).
Regarding the sources contributing to the completion
of R&D projects, where ﬁrms’ own manufacturing
operations tend to be most important (chosen by 32%
of the sample), only 19% of drug industry respondents reported their manufacturing operations to be
the most important knowledge source (p < 005), scoring in the lowest quartile (along with three other
chemical industries) of the 34 industries that span the
manufacturing sector.7
We can only conjecture why customers and the
ﬁrms’ own manufacturing operations are less important as sources of knowledge for R&D in the drug
industry as compared to others. Perhaps drug ﬁrms
do not have to go to customers to determine what
kinds of drugs will be most proﬁtable, but can rely
upon broad professional awareness of the relative
incidence of different diseases and medical conditions
to inform their expectations. With regard to the subordinate role of manufacturing operations, manufacturing processes have historically been rather routinized
in the drug industry, at least until recently. Our data
also suggest that if the linear model applies to any
industry, drugs would be the best candidate, although
even here feedback from customers (i.e., patients and
physicians) commonly stimulates upstream research.
Figures 1 and 2 show that public research plays
a less important role as a knowledge source than
a number of other sources. It is useful, however,
to divide our consideration of knowledge sources
between those that lie directly in what may be called
the ﬁrm’s vertical chain of production and sale,
including suppliers, buyers, and the ﬁrm’s own manufacturing operations, versus those that do not. While
the importance of public research never compares
favorably to those sources of knowledge residing in
the vertical chain (consistent with Klevorick et al.
7

At the same time, 19% of our drug industry respondents claimed
that public research, along with consultants/contract R&D, were
the most important sources contributing to project completion. In
contrast, the average for the total sample for public research is 5%
(p < 00001) and 7% for consultants/contract R&D (p < 00001).

7

<-----Page 7----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

1995), its importance is comparable to knowledge
sources that lie outside of it, namely competitors, consultants/contract R&D ﬁrms, and joint or cooperative
ventures. In the aggregate results, joint/cooperative
ventures (with other ﬁrms or universities) score consistently higher (p < 00001, using paired Wilcoxon
rank sign test) than public research—around 50%
for both suggesting project ideas and contributing to
project completion. Public research outscores, however, consultants/contract R&D as a source of knowledge for both suggesting new R&D projects (p <
00001) and contributing to project completion (n.s.).8
Although rivals constitute a more important source
for project ideas than public research institutions (41%
versus 32%, p < 00001), public research institutions
are markedly more important than rivals as a source
of knowledge contributing to project completion—
36% for public research versus 12% for competitors
(p < 00001), suggesting that the impact of public
research on ﬁrms’ R&D is at least comparable to
that of rivals’ R&D. To provide perspective on the
importance of the contribution of public research to
industrial R&D, consider that empirical studies in economics suggest that “R&D spillovers” from competitors (roughly comparable to our notion of information
ﬂows from rivals) contribute signiﬁcantly to technical
advance and productivity growth within industries
(Bernstein and Nadiri 1989, Griliches 1992).

What and How Much Does
Industry Get from Public
Research?

In our survey, we probed how public research contributes to technical advance in industry. The question
is whether industry beneﬁts from the creation of prototypes of, or idea-designs for, new products and processes, or rather from the less tangible and more intermediate input of disembodied knowledge. Scholars
8
Given that some joint or cooperative ventures are between ﬁrms
and public research institutions, we believe that the contribution of
joint and cooperative ventures to industrial R&D partially reﬂects
that of public research. This conjecture is supported by signiﬁcant
(p < 001), within-industry correlations between the contribution of
university/government labs and that of joint/cooperative ventures

of technical advance, notably Price (1984) and Rosenberg (1992), have also highlighted another form of
contribution of public research to technical advance in
industry—the development of new instruments and
techniques which ﬁnd use in industrial R&D. Accordingly, we asked respondents to report the percentage of their R&D projects which, over the prior three
years, “made use” of the following outputs from public research: (1) research ﬁndings; (2) prototypes; and
(3) new instruments and techniques.
For each category of output, Table 2 presents the
industry averages weighted by respondent lab R&D
spending.9 Since the response scale is deﬁned in terms
of broad categories (below 10%, 10%–40%, 41%–60%,
61%–90%, over 90%), we use category midpoints to
compute the percentages except in the lowest category, “below 10%,” to which we assign a value of 0%.
Responses to the survey suggest that the contribution of public research to industrial R&D is
principally via research ﬁndings, and this contribution is far greater than that of “prototypes.” The
weighted average for the percentage of R&D projects
using prototypes generated by public research is
only 8.3%. Prototypes generated by public research
falls in the 20%–35% range in only three industries
(glass, TV/radio, and motors/generators), and in the
10%–20% range in another three (drugs, machine
tools, and aerospace). In contrast, research ﬁndings
were considered useful in 29.3% of our respondents’
R&D projects. As Table 2 shows, public research ﬁndings are judged to be useful in over a quarter of
respondents’ R&D projects in the petroleum, pharmaceuticals, chemicals (nec), aerospace, communication,
search/navigation equipment, TV/radio, and semiconductor industries. Our survey also ﬁnds the instruments and techniques developed by university and
government labs to be useful to 22.2% of industrial
R&D projects. While not as pervasive in their impacts
as research ﬁndings, 20% or more of R&D projects
make use of such instruments and techniques across
a range of industries, including drugs, petroleum,

Weighting by R&D spending permits more accurate estimation
of the overall impact of public research on industrial R&D, which
requires, for example, giving the response of a $100 million R&D
unit more weight than one that spends only a million.

The response scale used here—namely the percentage of R&D projects using public research output—
allows us to go beyond purely subjective or relative
notions of importance by affording the opportunity
to quantify—however crudely—the impact of public
research in terms of the magnitude of industrial R&D

affected. In the 1991–1993 period, the U.S. manufacturing sector performed an average of $88 billion (in
constant 1992 dollars) of R&D per year. To the extent
that our sample reﬂects the range of R&D performing
ﬁrms and industries in the manufacturing sector, and
assuming that the percentage of projects using public research is equivalent to the percentage of R&D
effort expended, our result that 29.3% of industrial
9

<-----Page 9----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

R&D projects used public research ﬁndings implies
that an annual average of about $26 billion worth of
industrial R&D used public research ﬁndings in the
1990–1993 period. Similarly, our ﬁnding that 22.2% of
industrial R&D projects used instruments and techniques generated by public research implies that an
annual average of almost $20 billion worth of industrial R&D used such instruments and techniques.10
While we should interpret these estimates cautiously,
the results suggest that the overall impact of public
research on industrial R&D is substantial in absolute
terms.11

What Fields of Public Research
Contribute to Industrial R&D?

Building on a question posed in the earlier Yale Survey (Klevorick et al. 1995), we asked ﬁrms to evaluate, by ﬁeld, the importance to their R&D (on a
four-point Likert scale) of the contribution of public
research conducted over the prior 10 years for each of
ten ﬁelds, including: biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, material science, medical and health
science, chemical engineering, electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, and mathematics.
Our ﬁrst approach to using these responses to evaluate the importance of public research is to determine
whether a preponderance of an industry’s respondents (i.e., >50%) report public research to be at least
moderately important (scoring at least three on a fourpoint scale). Table 3 presents, by industry, the percentage of respondents scoring each of the ﬁelds at least
“moderately important.” Consistent with the earlier
Yale survey (Klevorick et al. 1995), we ﬁnd that, of the
10

Since projects using research ﬁndings and those using instruments and techniques derived from public research may overlap,
we cannot aggregate the two types of impact.

11

To the extent that we oversampled large ﬁrms (among the R&D
performing population) these estimates may be biased upward (see
results on ﬁrm size below). However, since this is an R&D, and
therefore size, weighted average, the inclusion of more small ﬁrms
would likely have only modest effects on the averages. Also, while
our sample represents the manufacturing sector broadly (since we
stratiﬁed our sample by industry), this estimate is sensitive to the
distribution of ﬁrms across industries since industries vary in their
use of public research.

10

basic sciences, only chemistry has a reasonably broad
impact on industrial R&D, with over 50% of industry respondents reporting it to be at least moderately
useful in the food, petroleum, metals, and several
chemical industries, including drugs. To the extent
that the other three examined ﬁelds of basic science,
namely physics, mathematics, and biology, are relevant, they tend to impact a speciﬁc industry. Biology
is particularly important for pharmaceuticals, with
64% of respondents reporting it to be at least moderately important, and physics is particularly relevant
to semiconductors, with 62% reporting it to be at least
moderately important. Following Nelson (1986) and
Klevorick et al. (1995), we note that the relatively low
scores for the basic sciences other than chemistry do
not mean that research in these ﬁelds is unimportant
for technical advance, but that their effect may be
expressed through the applied sciences and engineering ﬁelds that they inform.
As may be expected, more respondents consider
research in the engineering ﬁelds to contribute importantly to their R&D than research in the basic sciences, except for chemistry. Table 3 shows that the
impact of public research in chemical engineering
is most apparent in the petroleum and selected
chemical industries. The impact of public research
in mechanical engineering is most evident in general purpose machinery, glass and somewhat in the
transportation-related group of industries. Electrical
engineering is considered to be particularly important
across the range of industries concerned with electronics, including computers, semiconductors, communications equipment, and instruments, as well as
autoparts and glass.
Our ﬁndings on the impact of public research in the
applied sciences suggest that the inﬂuence of medical
and health science is strong in the drug and medical equipment industries. The impact of the other two
applied sciences considered, namely materials and
computer science, is much more pervasive—indeed
more pervasive than any basic science or engineering
ﬁeld. More than half of respondents rate computer
science research as at least moderately important
in the glass, printing/publishing, communications
equipment, search/navigation equipment, aerospace
and, of course, computer industries. The ﬁeld with

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

Table 3

<-----Page 11----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

the most pervasive direct impact on industrial R&D
is materials science. Half or more of industry respondents scored materials science as at least “moderately important” to their R&D activities in 15 of
our 33 manufacturing industries, spanning the chemicals, metals, electronics, machinery, and transportation equipment industries. If any discipline can be
awarded the title of a “general purpose” research ﬁeld
for the manufacturing sector, it is materials science.
When we identify industries in which a majority
of respondents report some research ﬁeld to be at
least moderately important, we observe a pervasive
impact of public research on industrial R&D. In 26
of the 34 industries, half or more of the respondents
reported at least one public research ﬁeld to be at
least moderately important, and half or more of the
respondents in 14 of the industries reported public
research from at least two ﬁelds to be at least moderately important. If we compute the simple average
of scores across respondents by ﬁeld, a somewhat
different picture emerges. One or more ﬁelds score
an average of 3.0 or higher in only eight of the 34
industries, including drugs, semiconductors, medical
equipment, communications equipment, aerospace,
TV/radio, search/navigation equipment, and glass.
Another way of summarizing these data is to ask
whether there is any ﬁeld of public research that is
especially important for a ﬁrm’s R&D. To evaluate the
importance of these most important ﬁelds by industry,
we compute the average of the maximum ﬁeld scores
by respondent (notwithstanding the ﬁeld) across all
respondents for each industry. On average, respondents rate the most important ﬁeld of public research
to be “moderately important,” as reﬂected in an average score of 3.04. Of the 34 industries, 21 report an
average of this maximum score to equal at least 3.0. A
handful of industries—drugs, glass, metals, computers, semiconductors, and medical equipment—show
scores of 3.30 and above.
Thus, the majority of our results on ﬁeld-speciﬁc
impacts suggest that public research conducted over
the prior 10 years is critical to a handful of industries
and is pervasively useful across the manufacturing
sector.
Of all our survey questions regarding the inﬂuence of public research, the question discussed in
12

this section most closely resembles one posed in the
Yale survey (Klevorick et al. 1995) and offers the
best opportunity for comparison. There are, however,
some important differences between the two surveys’
samples, questions, and response scales. First, the
CMS inquired about the importance of the research of
universities and government labs and institutes, while
the Yale survey inquired about university research
alone. Second, we requested respondents to evaluate, by ﬁeld, the importance of public research to
their own R&D activities while the Yale survey asked
respondents to report, by ﬁeld, the relevance of university research to technical progress for the respondent’s
industry as a whole. Third, while both surveys use
Likert scales, ours is four point while the Yale survey’s was seven. Fourth, the ﬁelds covered in the
CMS are a subset of those covered in the Yale survey; our survey did not include geology, agricultural
science, applied math/operations research, and metallurgy. Finally, the populations surveyed differed. The
Yale survey covered only larger, public ﬁrms; the CMS
provided substantial representation from small and
private ﬁrms as well. While we can do little about
the questions or response scales (other than rescaling), we can make the two samples more comparable by restricting ours to only the larger ﬁrms (with
sales over $500 million). For the comparison, we also
conform our industry deﬁnitions to the Yale industry
deﬁnitions and restrict our attention only to those 33
of the 130 four-digit SIC level industries surveyed by
the Yale team that have at least four observations in
each sample.
To consider whether the two surveys yield different results, we make several comparisons. First, we
compute the average of the maximum ﬁeld scores
by respondent (notwithstanding the ﬁeld) for each
industry. For 21 of the 33 “comparison” industries
in the CMS, this average maximum score equals at
least three of a maximum of four (reﬂecting “moderate importance”). In comparison, for 23 of the 33
industries in theYale survey, this average maximum
score equals at least 5.25 (the rescaled equivalent to
3.0 in the CMS). When we compute simply the average score by ﬁeld for each industry, 12 of the 33 industries in the CMS have at least one ﬁeld attaining an
average score of 3.0 or above, and 13 industries in the
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 12----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

Yale survey have at least one ﬁeld attaining an average score of 5.25. When we compare the number of
industries in which half or more of the respondents
reported at least one public research ﬁeld to be at least
moderately important, we again observe very similar
results across the two samples.12 Overall, the earlier
Yale survey’s ﬁndings of the ﬁeld-speciﬁc inﬂuence of
university research on industrial research appear to be
comparable to those of the Carnegie Mellon Survey.
Can we conclude from this comparison that the
extent of the contribution of public research to industrial R&D has changed little between 1983 when the
Yale survey was administered and 1994 when the
CMS was? Although our comparison provides little
support for the position that the inﬂuence of public
research has become more pervasive, we are reluctant
to conclude that little has changed. Our comparison
is necessarily based on the subset of industries where
comparison was possible. Also, in light of the differences between the questions and response scales,
any assessments of intertemporal changes in inﬂuence
within industries are limited.13 In any case, most of
the results considered in this section suggest that, as
of the mid-1990s, the contribution of public research
to industrial R&D is widespread.

7.

Dimensions and Incidence of
Inﬂuence of Public Research

In the prior three sections, we examined the inﬂuence of public research along different dimensions.
12

In 26 of the 33 comparison industries in the CMS, half or more
of the respondents reported at least one public research ﬁeld to
be at least moderately important (scoring three out of a four-point
scale). In the Yale survey, half or more of the respondents reported
a score of ﬁve or six (on its seven point scale) in, respectively, 28
and 18 industries. Since the CMS number falls in the upper end of
the range between the two Yale frequencies, the numbers appear
to be similar.

13

To the extent that there is an expressed difference from the earlier
Yale survey in the evaluation of the importance of public research
based on these ﬁeld-speciﬁc scores, it is difﬁcult to determine
whether the authors of the earlier study may have understated
the scope of the impact of public research or whether, between
the dates of the two studies, the importance of public research
increased (as Narin et al. 1997, for example, believe).

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

We examined: (1) how public research affects industrial R&D in the sense of whether it suggests new
R&D projects or contributes to the completion of
existing ones; (2) the inﬂuence of three different types
of output of public research, including research ﬁndings, instruments, and techniques and prototypes; and
(3) the general importance of the impact on industrial R&D by research ﬁeld, scored along a semantic scale. In this section, we consider how these three
dimensions of inﬂuence relate to one another, and
what those relationships suggest about the inﬂuence
of public research more generally. To address these
questions, we compute simple correlations across the
different dimensions of inﬂuence, measured at the
industry level for 64 industries deﬁned at the threeor four-digit ISIC level.
Across the three dimensions of inﬂuence, at the
industry level, we typically observe signiﬁcant correlations in the 0.25 to 0.45 range.14 One telling exception to this pattern, is that, between each of the three
types of output from public research (research ﬁndings, instruments and techniques, prototypes) and the
frequency with which public research contributes to
the completion of existing projects, the correlations
are low (around 0.10) and insigniﬁcant.15 Given that
public research importantly affects industrial R&D by
contributing to R&D project completion, we interpret these weak relationships to suggest that public research may contribute to project completion in
ways or forms that are not reﬂected in the three
output types considered, namely research ﬁndings,
prototypes, or instruments and techniques. These
may include, for example, the kind of knowledge
that is conveyed via interpersonal interactions like
consulting or informal relationships.16 If true, this
14

The “importance score” (out of a one- to four-point Likert scale)
for that ﬁeld of public research which is most important to an
industrial lab’s R&D is most highly correlated with the other
dimensions of inﬂuence (in the 0.30 to 0.45 range).

15

In contrast, the correlations between the percentage of R&D
projects affected by each of the three examined output types and
the frequency with which public research suggests new projects are
signiﬁcant, in the range of 021 to 028.

16

Consistent with this conjecture, we observe strong industry-level
correlations between the degree to which public research contributes to project completion and the importance of the channels of

13

<-----Page 13----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

implies that our estimated percentages of industrial
R&D projects affected by the research ﬁndings or
instruments and techniques originating from public research understate the overall impact of public
research.
Given that our ﬁndings show that public research
can do different things in different industries, it
should not be surprising that it is not just the R&D
of “high tech” industries that beneﬁts from public
research. For example, among the six industries with
50% or more respondents reporting public research as
a source of new project ideas, we ﬁnd steel, machine
tools, and petroleum—three industries considered to
be “mature.” Similarly, among the seven industries
with 45% or more of the respondents reporting public research contributing to the completion of existing projects, we ﬁnd three other mature industries,
namely food, paper, and car/truck. To probe more
systematically the relationship between our various
measures of the inﬂuence of public research and
industry innovative activity, we correlate our measures of inﬂuence with industry R&D intensity, measured as R&D weighted averages of business unit
R&D expenditures to sales. As expected, the strength
of the correlations vary considerably across the different dimensions of inﬂuence of public research,
with the strongest relationships between industry
R&D intensity and the percentage of industrial R&D
projects making use of research ﬁndings r = 031
or new instruments and techniques r = 029 originating from public research. We observe the weakest relationship between industry R&D intensity and
the degree to which public research contributes to the
completion of existing projects r = 005, which is not
surprising if one considers that public research may
partly substitute for a ﬁrm’s own R&D.17 If public
research substitutes for industrial R&D and possibly
information ﬂow between industrial R&D labs and public research
(discussed below) of consulting and informal interaction (054 and
046, respectively). Also consistent with this conjecture, the channel of consulting is only weakly associated with the use of any of
the three output types (all three correlations are 012 or less and
n.s.). The pathway of informal interaction is, however, signiﬁcantly
associated with the use of research ﬁndings r = 028.
17

If it only substituted for R&D, we would expect a negative correlation.

14

obviates the need to undertake some R&D projects,
then estimates of the percentage of R&D projects
affected by public research outputs will only provide
a partial, intermediate sense of the impacts of public research on technical advance. This provides yet
another reason to believe that our estimates in §6 of
the impact of public research outputs on the share of
industrial R&D projects may underestimate the overall effect of public research on technical advance and
productivity growth.

Pathways of Knowledge Flow

The Carnegie Mellon Survey evaluated how useful
information moves from universities and other public research institutions to industrial R&D facilities.
We asked our respondents to report on a four-point
Likert scale the importance to a recently completed
“major” R&D project of each of 10 possible sources (or
channels) of information on the R&D activities of universities or government R&D labs or institutes. The
information sources considered include patents, informal information exchange, publications and reports,
public meetings and conferences, recently hired graduates, licenses, joint or cooperative ventures, contract research, consulting, and temporary personnel
exchanges. Table 4 presents the percentage of respondents indicating that a given channel is at least “moderately important.” As shown, publications/reports
are the dominant channel, with 41% of respondents
rating them as at least moderately important. Informal information exchange, public meetings or conferences, and consulting follow in importance, with
aggregate scores for each of these channels in the
range of 31% to 36%.18 After that point, there is a
sharp dropoff in the scoring to another set of channels, namely recently hired graduates, joint and cooperative ventures and patents, with aggregate scores
in the range of 17% to 21% of respondents indicating
these channels to be at least moderately important.
Licenses and personnel exchange are the least important channels, with scores of less than 10%.
18

Thursby and Thursby (2001) similarly ﬁnd that industry licensing
executives identiﬁed publications and presentations, and especially
personal contacts, as their most important sources for university
technologies.

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

<-----Page 15----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

These aggregate scores show that the most important channels of information ﬂow between public
research institutions and industrial R&D labs are the
channels of open science, notably publications and
public meetings and conferences. Moreover, these
channels, as well as the next most important channels
of informal information exchange and consulting, are
relatively decentralized in the sense that they do not
typically reﬂect formal institutional links. With the
exception of consulting, these most important channels are also not mediated through any sort of market
exchange.
The relatively high score for consulting underscores
the importance of this little-studied vehicle through
which public research impacts industrial R&D. Both
more and less R&D intensive industries consider consulting to be important. Industries where over 40% of
respondents report consulting to be at least moderately important include food, petroleum, drugs, metals, semiconductors, aerospace, and medical and other
equipment.
Surprisingly, the hiring of recent graduates is of
small importance overall. This result requires some
elaboration. First, we are inquiring about the impact
on industrial R&D of public research, not the about
the broader economic impacts of university training.
Also, if one looks at the industry-level results, one
observes recent graduates playing a somewhat important role relative to other channels in selected industries, notably in the electronic component, communications equipment and computer industries, although
publications are still more important in these industries.
One assumption underlying current policy is that
cooperative or joint ventures between universities and
industry will encourage the use of academic research
by industry.19 Since, as noted above, our data reﬂect
19

Since the 1970s, for example, we have witnessed the growth of the
NSF’s Science and Technology Centers and Engineering Research
Centers that tie government support for university research to
industry participation. Stimulated by the example of such programs and by the desire to tap into industry and tied government
support, university-industry R&D centers have grown rapidly. Of
the 1,056 estimated university-industry R&D centers existing as of
1990, almost 60% were established in the prior decade and by 1990
they were the beneﬁciaries of almost 25% of all government support of university research (Cohen et al. 1998).

16

predominantly the impact of university research, they
suggest that such cooperative ventures have typically
not contributed as importantly to industrial R&D as
other channels, at least not in any direct fashion.
Exceptions to this overall pattern, where a third or
more of our respondents report joint and cooperative
ventures to be at least moderately important, include
drugs (where all channels tend to be more important),
glass, steel, TV/radio, and aerospace. In some industries such as steel (where another channel, contract
R&D, is an even more important channel than joint
or cooperative ventures), such cooperative relationships may have become substitutes for industry R&D
as upstream and corporate R&D have been cut back.
Intellectual property policy affecting public
research has also changed over the past two decades.
The Bayh-Dole Act permits universities, govenment
research labs and other nonproﬁt institutions to
obtain patent rights to the output of federally sponsored research. The impetus behind Bayh-Dole and
related legislation was the assumption that there
was a stock of underexploited, valuable knowledge
residing in universities and other research institutions
receiving federal funding, and that patents would
“incentivize” the private sector to undertake the
downstream R&D and related investment necessary
for commercialization (Mazzoleni and Nelson 1998).
Although our results cannot speak to the effects
of patents and licensing on industry’s incentives to
use and commercialize public research, they suggest
that licenses and patents are subordinate means of
conveying the content of that research to industry.
Our data indicate that, even though the impact of
public research is reasonably pervasive, patents and
licenses appear to be useful mechanisms of technology transfer in only a few industries. In most industries, patents and licenses are not nearly as important as other channels for conveying public research
to industry, including publications, conferences, informal information exchange, or consulting. Even in
some high tech industries reporting substantial public research impacts, such as communications equipment and aerospace, patents and licenses achieved
scores that were at best average. The main industry
where patents and licenses appear to be important
for conveying public research is the pharmaceutical

industry—with 50% and 34% of respondents reporting patents and licenses, respectively, to be at least
moderately important as channels. Even here, however, informal channels and the channels of open science were still more important.
Thus, even if one accepts the premise of the BayhDole Amendment that privatization of public research
motivates industry to use it—which some scholars
(e.g., Mowery et al. 2000) do not—we should not
assume that patents and licenses provide the grist
for the mills of industrial R&D. Rather, it is typically
the public expressions of public research (i.e., publications, meetings, and conferences), or even informal
interactions and consulting that centrally convey the
content of that research to industry.
One question regarding the channels through
which public research impacts industrial R&D is how
the use of different channels, or at least the respondents’ evaluations of their importance, relate to one
another. To address this question, we conducted a factor analysis at the industry-level. Presented in Table 5,
the factor analysis shows the industry average scores
for the channels loading on two factors. The channels
that load on the ﬁrst factor include publications, conferences and meetings, informal interaction, consulting, contract research, and joint or cooperative ventures. Licenses, the hiring of recent graduates, and
personnel exchange load on a second factor. Patents
do not load on either factor. The loadings on the ﬁrst
factor suggest that person-to-person interactions tend

to be used with and perhaps complement more public channels such as publications or meetings. Indeed,
prior work in the sociology of science suggests that
direct exchanges often complement the published literature as a means of conveying information (Walsh
and Bayma 1996). In the case of industrial R&D, such
interactions may stem, for example, from an engineer
seeing an article and then contacting the author about
how the research might be used. Or, communications
with faculty might point to published research of use
to the ﬁrm’s R&D. We suspect that both processes
are common and help explain the high correlations
among these channels.20
In addition to examining the relationships across
the channels of inﬂuence of public research, our
survey data permit examination of the relationship
between the importance of the different channels
20

Gibbons and Johnston (1975) similarly found that the technical
literature and “personal contact” were most beneﬁcial to technological innovation when used together. Faulkner and Senker (1995)
conﬁrm this ﬁnding in their study of public sector research and
industrial innovation in biotechnology, engineering ceramics, and
parallel computing. Jensen and Thursby (2001) similarly report that
successful licensing of university technologies to industry typically requires, not only the license, but additional input by the
university-based inventor due to the embyronic state of development of the licensed technology.

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

and how public research affects industrial R&D—i.e.,
whether it suggests new R&D projects or contributes
to the completion of existing ones. Table 6 presents
the correlation coefﬁcients between the industry average scores for the importance of each channel to
a ﬁrm’s R&D and the frequency, by industry, with
which public research either suggests a new R&D
project or contributes to project completion. We
observe that the importance of the channels of consulting, contract research, public conferences, and
meetings are signiﬁcantly and comparably correlated (i.e., within 0.10 of one another) with both of
these effects of public research. We ﬁnd, however,
much stronger correlations (in the range of 0.46 to
0.49) between the importance scores of publications,
informal information exchange, and joint/cooperative
R&D projects with the contribution of public research
to project completion than to the suggestion of new
projects (in the range of 0.15 to 0.25). This ﬁnding suggests that industrial R&D personnel seek out
academics, search the literature, or form cooperative ventures with public research institutions more
commonly to address particular needs or problems
than to generate new project ideas.21

9.

Firm Characteristics and the
Inﬂuence of Public Research

Having considered the aggregate and industry-level
impacts of public research on industrial R&D, we
now consider within-industry, cross-ﬁrm differences
in those impacts. Following Link and Rees (1990) and
Acs et al. (1994), we focus on whether there is a relationship between the degree to which a ﬁrm might
exploit public research and its size. On the basis of an
analysis of geographically deﬁned, state-level industry R&D expenditures and university research expenditures, Acs et al. (1994) infer that small ﬁrms’ R&D
spending responds disproportionately more to university research, and conclude that small ﬁrms have a
“comparative advantage at exploiting spillovers from
university laboratories.” For a sample of ﬁrms in
21

The only pathway with an importance score more highly correlated with the contribution of public research to suggesting new
projects is “recently hired graduates with advanced degrees.”

18

machine tools, computing, and aircraft and components, Link and Rees (1990) ﬁnd that large ﬁrms are
more likely to have ties to university research. However, their analysis of rates of return to R&D shows
the returns to R&D of small ﬁrms’ involved in university research to be higher than that of large ﬁrms,
which they interpret to mean that small ﬁrms are
able to transfer knowledge gained from their university research associations more effectively than larger
ﬁrms.22
The CMS data offer a range of direct—though selfreported—measures of the knowledge inﬂow from
university and government R&D labs. As described
above, our data include percentages of ﬁrms’ R&D
projects that make use of public research, as well as
whether or not knowledge from university or government labs either suggests new R&D projects or contributes to the completion of existing projects in the
prior three years. We use an ordered logistic regression model to analyze within-industry variation in the
percentages of R&D projects that use public research
since the response scale is expressed as range intervals (i.e., below 10%, 10%–40%, 41%–60%, 61%–90%,
over 90%). We employ a logistic regression to analyze factors that might affect whether public research
suggests new R&D projects or contributes to project
completion because each of these two latter variables
is binary (i.e., yes/no). To focus on the effect of the
within-industry variation of selected ﬁrm characteristics, we include 33 industry dummies to control for
industry-ﬁxed effects.
The key independent variable we consider is ﬁrm
size, measured as log of ﬁrm sales. We believe that
22

Both of these papers were trying to consider why smaller ﬁrms’
R&D productivity is greater than that of larger ﬁrms by appealing
to the possibility that small ﬁrms rely more heavily on extramural research, and particularly university research, in lieu of internal
R&D. Cohen and Klepper (1996) show, however, that the lower
average R&D productivity of larger ﬁrms can easily be explained
by the fact that larger ﬁrms simply undertake more R&D projects
at the margin because, in most industries, they earn a higher return
per R&D dollar due to their spreading of the ﬁxed costs of R&D
over greater levels of output. Thus, the differences in the average
R&D productivity of larger versus smaller ﬁrms do not necessarily reﬂect any differences in R&D efﬁciency related to ﬁrm size,
nor need they reﬂect greater exploitation of extramural knowledge
ﬂows on the part of smaller ﬁrms.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 18----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

our sample is well suited to testing the impact of
ﬁrm size since it includes ﬁrms from across the entire
range of the ﬁrm size distribution, with over a third of
our sample ﬁrms having fewer than 500 employees,
which is the conventional cutoff to reﬂect small ﬁrms.
We also wish to consider whether public research
affects technical advance particularly by inﬂuencing
the R&D of start-up ﬁrms since start-ups are sometimes viewed as a key vehicle for transferring university research into commercial products.23 Thus, we
also include on the right-hand side a dummy variable, START-UP, signifying whether a ﬁrm is a startup, deﬁned as a ﬁrm that is no more than ﬁve years
old, with fewer than 500 employees in 1993, and typically active in only one industry. Our analysis of the
impact of public research on start-up ﬁrms is, however, limited. Because our sample was not designed
to test the role of university research in start-up companies, we did not oversample start-up ﬁrms and so
have relatively few observations—22, which are concentrated in only three industries; ﬁve observations
are in pharmaceuticals, four in computers, and four
in medical equipment.
Presented in Table 7, the logistic regression results
show a highly signiﬁcant, positive effect of the log
of ﬁrm size across all three dependent variables, suggesting that larger ﬁrms are more likely to use public research. One might argue that since larger ﬁrms
tend to conduct more R&D and be involved in more
R&D projects, one might expect that public research
is more likely to suggest new R&D projects or contribute to the completion of existing ones for larger
ﬁrms just on a random basis. Perhaps more informative, then, is the column (1) result that larger ﬁrms use
public research in a larger percentage of their R&D
projects.24 In addition to the size effect, we ﬁnd a positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient estimate on START-UP
in columns (1) and (3). START-UP is only signiﬁcant
23

The Association of University Technology Managers 1999 Licensing Survey reports that 62% of university licenses were to small
ﬁrms (12% were to companies started as a result of the license),
and that university research led to the founding of 344 companies
(AUTM 1999).

24

We also ﬁnd that larger ﬁrms are more likely to score higher on
MAXSCI—the importance of public research from the most relevant
ﬁeld. The MAXSCI regression results are available upon request.

at the 010 conﬁdence level in column (2), suggesting that while start-up ﬁrms use public research in a
greater percentage of their R&D projects than other
ﬁrms and are more likely to use public research for
completing existing R&D projects, they do not clearly
rely more than other ﬁrms on public research as a
source of new project ideas.25
25

We checked to see if our results were robust to the inclusion of
R&D intensity (measured as the ratio of business unit R&D employment over total business unit employment), the Ph.D./M.D. intensity of the lab, and the effort dedicated by the R&D lab to the
monitoring or gathering of extramural scientiﬁc and technical information. All the results are robust, except for the already weak effect
of “START-UP” in column 2, which becomes insigniﬁcant. These
results are not featured due to the likely endogeneity of all three
variables, and controlling for that endogeneity is beyond the scope
of the present paper.
We also ran all speciﬁcations with MAXSCI as a dependent variable. These results suggest that start-ups are not signiﬁcantly more
likely to rate any ﬁeld public research as more important. To consider the possibility that start-ups disproportionately focus on basic
research, we created a new dependent variable, MAXBASIC, which
is the maximum score among the basic research ﬁelds of biology,
chemistry, physics, and mathematics. We replicated the Table 7
regressions for this variable to see if start-ups score higher in terms

19

<-----Page 19----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

To probe the role of start-ups in more detail, we
ran a series of comparisons between start-up ﬁrms
and the rest of our sample for the three industries
where we have at least four start-up ﬁrms per our
deﬁnition: drugs, computers, and medical equipment.
We use a nonparametric (Wilcoxon rank sum) test for
differences in group means between start-ups and the
rest of the ﬁrms in each industry.26
For the pharmaceutical industry, we ﬁnd that startups are more closely tied to public research than
established ﬁrms. For example, while about half of
the non-start-up drug ﬁrms report public research
suggesting new projects or contributing to existing
projects, 100% of start-up ﬁrms said yes to both
questions (p < 010 for each). Comparing the percent of projects that use the public research outputs of research ﬁndings, prototypes, or instruments
and techniques, we again ﬁnd that start-up ﬁrms
score higher than more established drug companies.
On average, 72% of start-up ﬁrm projects made use
of research ﬁndings, while only 36% of established
ﬁrm projects did p < 005. For prototypes, the averages are 27% for start-ups and 13% for non-start-ups
(ns). For instruments/techniques, start-ups are again
higher (23% v. 20%) though the gap is small.27
of their use of basic sciences. While large ﬁrms use basic research
more, the start-up effect is close to zero.
26

One might conjecture that, since we do not control for ﬁrm size
in the analyses of the role of start-ups in the three industries, the
association between start-ups and the inﬂuence of public research
may appear to be weaker since start-ups tend to be small and larger
ﬁrms tend to use public research more intensively (per our regressions). The qualitative results for the industry analyses are robust,
however, even when we do control for ﬁrm size in logistic regressions run for each of the three industry samples.

27

Regarding the relative importance of the different channels
through which knowledge may ﬂow from public research to ﬁrms’
R&D (e.g., publications, conferences, licenses, etc. per Table 4), all
score the same or higher for start-ups, reﬂecting the greater overall
impact of public research on start-ups in the drug industry. There is,
however, an especially notable difference with regard to the role of
licensing, which scores on average 3.0 on a four-point scale versus
a score of only 1.9 for non-start-up drug companies p < 005. Of
the other channels of knowledge ﬂow, joint and cooperative R&D
projects and contract research also scored notably higher for startups, but with differences that were only weakly signiﬁcant (e.g.,
p < 015).

20

For our other two industries, medical equipment
and computers, the results on the use of public
research by start-ups versus more established ﬁrms
are mixed. For example, in medical equipment, established ﬁrms score higher on public research suggesting projects (36% v. 25%) and start-ups score
higher on public research helping to complete projects
(50% v. 42%), though neither difference is statistically signiﬁcant. Medical equipment start-ups report
a signiﬁcantly greater percent of projects making use
of research ﬁndings (50% v. 21%, p < 005), prototypes
(33% v. 10%, p < 005), and instruments/techniques
(33% v. 15%, n.s.).28
For computers, evidence of a disproportionate use
of public research by start-ups is weaker. For suggesting projects, there is no difference (25% of startups v. 23% of non-start-ups). For completing projects,
50% of start-ups say, “yes”, versus 19% of non-startups p < 020. Ten percent of start-up ﬁrms’ projects
make use of research ﬁndings, in comparison to 16%
of non-start-up ﬁrms’ projects (n.s.). Five percent of
start-ups use prototypes versus seven percent for nonstart-ups. And, only 5% of start-up projects use instruments/techniques, compared to 15% for non-start-up
projects (n.s.).29
Thus, our comparison of start-ups and other ﬁrms
in three high-tech industries shows that start-ups are
most clearly tied to public research in the pharmaceutical industry. This should not be surprising, since the
biotech start-up is the archetypical university, licensebased spinoff. For medical equipment and computers, the difference between start-up ﬁrms and established ﬁrms is less manifest. Across all three industries, as in the full sample regressions, start-ups are,
however, more likely than established ﬁrms to use
public research to complete existing projects than as
a source of new project ideas.
28

Regarding the importance of the channels through which public
research may affect industrial R&D information, there is no clear
difference in scores between start-ups and established ﬁrms in the
medical equipment industry.

29

With regard to information channels, eight of the ten are more
important to start-ups than to established ﬁrms, but only temporary personal exchanges is signiﬁcant (1.8 v. 1.2, p < 015), and the
importance of licensing is nearly equal (1.5 for start-ups; 1.4 for
non-start-ups).

The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

The overall picture, therefore, is that larger ﬁrms
are more likely to make greater use of public
research, though start-up ﬁrms also beneﬁt from public research, especially in pharmaceuticals.

Conclusion

The responses to our questionnaire suggest, on balance, that public research importantly affects industrial R&D in a broad range of industries, though often
in different ways. It is sometimes a difﬁcult matter
to judge importance of such an effect, and we do so
in a number of ways. First, our data shows that a
large share—almost a third of industrial R&D projects
for our sample ﬁrms—made use of research ﬁndings
from public research, and over a ﬁfth made use of
instruments and techniques. Other evidence from our
survey further suggests that the knowledge originating from public research is often conveyed outside of
these particular forms of output, such as through consulting or informal communications, implying that
the share of R&D projects affected by public research
is likely even greater than that which makes use of
either the research ﬁndings or the techniques and
instruments generated by public research. We also
observed that the effect of the knowledge originating from public research on industrial R&D appears
to be at least as great as the effect of that originating from rival R&D, and, as noted above, the empirical economics literature on R&D spillovers suggest
intraindustry spillovers to be important to productivity growth. Most summaries of respondents’ subjective evaluations of the importance of public research,
broken down by ﬁeld, also suggest that while public
research is critical to a small number of industries, it
is “moderately important” across a broad swath of the
manufacturing sector. Although public research may
be important in some absolute sense, we also ﬁnd—as
do Klevorick et al. (1995)—that its direct and immediate impact is much less, however, than sources of
knowledge that lie more directly in the vertical chain
of production and sale, including suppliers, buyers,
and the ﬁrms’ own manufacturing operations.
Our survey also lends considerable support to the
more nuanced, interactive conception of the innovation process advanced by Gibbons and Johnston
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

(1975), Kline and Rosenberg (1986), von Hippel (1988),
and Nelson (1990), where public research will sometimes lead technological development, but, more typically, downstream research and development or buyer
input provide the impetus and guidance for what
industrial R&D labs do. Consistent with this picture
is the dominant role, noted above, of buyers and the
ﬁrm’s own manufacturing operations in either suggesting new industrial R&D projects or contributing
to the completion of existing projects. Also consistent
with this characterization is our ﬁnding that public
research provides ways of solving problems at least
as often as it suggests new project ideas.
Our survey yields other ﬁndings similar to those
of the Yale survey. For example, we observe that the
impact of public research, at least in most industries,
is exercised through engineering and applied science
ﬁelds—especially materials and computer science—
rather than through basic sciences. Reﬂecting on
the earlier Yale survey ﬁndings, Nelson (1986) and
Klevorick et al. (1995) have cautioned, however, that
the greater importance of more applied ﬁelds does not
mean that basic science has little impact, but that its
impact may be mediated through the more applied
sciences or through the application of industrial technologists’ and scientists’ basic scientiﬁc training to the
routine challenges of conducting R&D.
We also ﬁnd that there are some clear differences
in the impacts of public research across industries. In
this regard, the pharmaceutical industry stands out
as an anomaly along many dimensions. There is no
other industry where public research—and particularly a basic science (i.e., biology)—is thought to be
so relevant. Also, knowledge from buyers and ﬁrms’
own manufacturing operations are less important to
R&D in pharmaceuticals than in other industries, suggesting that the linear model may characterize the
innovation process better in this industry than in others. Moreover, patents and licenses are key means of
conveying information from public research to industry in pharmaceuticals, partly reﬂecting the fact that
patents are more effective in protecting inventions in
drugs than in any other manufacturing industry (cf.
Levin et al. 1987, Cohen et al. 2000). Finally, the drug
industry is one where start-ups clearly are more tied
to public research than are ﬁrms in general.
21

<-----Page 21----->COHEN, NELSON, AND WALSH
The Inﬂuence of Public Research on Industrial R&D

In contrast to prior work (e.g., Acs et al. 1994),
we do not ﬁnd that small ﬁrms disproportionately
beneﬁt from public research. Our regression results
robustly show that large ﬁrms are much more likely
to use public research. Although small ﬁrms in general exploit public research less, start-ups appear to
use it more. While start-ups appear to differ from
other small, established ﬁrms in the degree to which
they beneﬁt, our survey data do not tell us why. Perhaps some start-ups originate from universities and
thus have strong pre-existing ties, or perhaps they
are spinoffs from large ﬁrms and consequently beneﬁt from the stronger ties that our data suggest exist
between larger ﬁrms and the institutions of public
research.
Two policy questions that come up repeatedly
regarding university research in particular is how
much government support should it receive, and,
second, should particular kinds of bridging mechanisms between universities and industry—such as
university-industry cooperative ventures or technology licensing—be encouraged.
Although we cannot address the ﬁrst question
directly, our research suggests that the contribution of
public research to industrial R&D is considerable and
pervasive. Regarding the second question, our results
on the channels of information ﬂow between public research and industry suggest that the decentralized and longstanding channels of publications, conferences, informal exchange, and consulting are the
most important. We would suggest that, even when
university-industry cooperative ventures or technology licensing between public research institutions and
industry support technology transfer in an immediate way, encouragement of such bridging mechanisms
should not come at the expense—as they occasionally
do—of the other more important channels of open science noted above (cf. Cohen et al. 1998).
The limitations of our study are numerous. First,
our survey was designed to convey a sense of the
more immediate impacts of public research. It was
not our intent to discern the long-run effects of science or the training effects that may be universities’
greatest contribution to technical advance. Thus, to
the degree that we have identiﬁed impacts, our estimates should be considered conservative. Second, we
22

have relied only upon one method in this study—a
survey-based description. To arrive at more accurate
and robust estimates of the impacts of public research,
one should deploy numerous data sources and methods of analysis, including surveys, ﬁeld studies, and
econometric analyses. Also, our analysis of start-ups
is preliminary. Further research explicitly designed to
compare start-ups to established ﬁrms is needed to
examine their role. Also, based on a survey of ﬁrms
at a point in time, our analysis cannot consider the
role of public research in affecting the long-run evolution of industries, no less how industry itself shapes
public research over time.
Overall, our results suggest that university research
has a substantial impact on industrial research, that
this impact is primarily through public and personal
channels, and that university research contributes
to project completion as well as suggesting new
projects. We also ﬁnd substantial cross-industry differences, though few systematic differences between
high-tech and more mature industries. These results
suggest that both public research and industry product and process development progress through complex, intertwined processes, with public research
sometimes driving industry R&D, but also providing
knowledge that abets the progress of projects initiated due to information, needs and opportunities that
originate from buyers, the ﬁrm’s own manufacturing
operations, and other sources. We suspect that universities play this role not simply because they produce knowledge, but because, as pointed out by Goto
(2000), they are also repositories thereof.
