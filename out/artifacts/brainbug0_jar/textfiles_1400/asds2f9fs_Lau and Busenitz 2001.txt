Growth Intentions of
Entrepreneurs in a
Transitional Economy:
The People's Republic
of China
;
Chung-Ming Lau
Lowell W. Busenitz

This research partially tests a model of entrepreneurial cognition among small business
owners in the transition economy of China. Addressing these issues helps to answer questions about how entrepreneurs create, sustain, and transform organizations. The influence
of social context, personal factors, and cognition of Chinese entrepreneurs on their growth
intentions and their method of expansion were examined. Based on a sample of 2,878
Chinese small private business owners, we not only found that an entrepreneur's commitment, need for achievement, and social environment is important, but that a cognitive understanding of the environment also has a direct impact on growth intentions.

I he emergence of new and small businesses is now widely recognized as frequently having a significant impact on economic development (Reynolds, 1991; Jackson,
Klich, & Poznanska, 1999: Wright, Hoskis.son. Filatotchev, & Buck, 1998). This has
been particularly evident in the People's Republic of China (PRC) since the implementation of economic reforms in 1978 (Chow & Fung. 1996: Lau. Ngo. & Chow, 1999:
Tsang, 1996). However, the entrepreneurial mindset of the business owners in an
economy transitioning from a central planning mode may yield important insights into
how they view growth opportunities. This research addresses the issues of how private
business owners in the PRC perceive their business future, and how they pursue growth.
The growth intentions of small business owners within the context of the transitional
economy are believed to have varying impacts on the type of growth that they pursue.
Recent research is beginning to address how entrepreneurs think, how they direct
attention towards a business concept, and how they create, sustain, and transform organizations (e.g.. Baron. 1998: Busenitz & Barney, 1997: Morse, Mitchell, Brok, & Seawright. 1999: Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). According to the cross-cultural cognitive
model proposed by Busenitz and Lau (1996), cultural values, social context, and personal
variables influence entrepreneurial cognition. This cognition will in turn affect how
entrepreneurs start a new venture and their intentions for growth. The model emphasizes
the interaction between person and environment in new venture decisions. In iight of
this, we test hypotheses adapted from the Busenitz and Lau model to specifically examine how the social context and personal variables would affect growth-related cognitive outcomes of new and small business owners in China.
While entrepreneurial phenomena have been examined in numerous developing
countries (Acs & Audretsch, 1993: Blawatt, 1995; Chen, 1999; Luo, 1995; Mead, Jones,
Faii, 2001

<-----Page 1----->& Chansarkar, 1997; Shane & Kolvereid. 1995; Zapalska, 1997; Zhao & Aram, 1995).
we .still know very little about how entrepreneurs think, particularly in transitional
economics like the PRC. Mo.st research in the PRC has focused on larger multinational
enterprises. Individual-based research that has been completed has generally involved
case-oriented or small-sample qualitative studies (e.g., Lee, 1998: Ahlstrom. Bruton. &
Lui, 2000). Additionally, only a few theoretical models for international entrepreneurship research exist (Oviatt & McDougall. 1994; Shane. 1994; Busenitz & Lau, 1996;
Tiessen, 1997). This article not only utilizes a large sample database, but it also partially
tests a recently developed theoretical model.
The private sector has provided much impetus for economic development in European and Asian transitional economics (Appold, Thanh, Kasarda, & Hung. 1996; Odagiri. 1997; Regnier. 1992). particularly for long-term development (Acs & Audretsch.
1993). In the PRC. the number of private businesses has expanded rapidly since the
economic reform of 1978.' The government now affirms private businesses as central to
the vitality of the Chinese economy (Chow, 1995). These new, smaller enterprises
provided critical innovations for competing in a more competitive global environment."^
While private small business owners in the transitional economy of the PRC have
many opportunities, they also encounter numerous threats (Tsang. 1994). Problems
emerge when economic liberalization is not appropriately complemented by political and
ideological reforms. For example, laws and property rights issues are often interpreted
differently by overlapping government bodies. While state-owned firms tend to be
constrained by a number of state objectives and societal obligations (Lau. 1998). private
businesses may be more flexible and have more expansion opportunities. Private enterprises also have higher productivity and fewer problems with shirking (Byrd & Lin,
1993). In sum, with change comes inherent uncertainty as well as numerous opportunities for new business owners.

MODEL AND DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES
Examining the entrepreneurial intentions of small business owners in a transitional
economy provides a unique opportunity to examine how different factors may impact
future growth expectations. The threats and opportunities of this environment present a
multitude of challenges to these private businesses owners. In probing how Chinese
business owners think and which factors tend to be linked to different expansion opportunities, this study asks two questions. First, how do different socio-demographic
variables and individual needs of small private business owners affect the intentions of
whether or not to expand their business? Second, if operations are expanded, what factors
predict the development of cooperative arrangements with other firms? The perceptions
of business owners regarding their environment are likely to lead to varying positions on
whether they should expand, change directions, or even liquidate the business. If they
choose to expand, linkages with other firms through local or foreign alliances are common.
^ See Bruton et al. (2000) for more detailed characteristics of cla.sses of Chinese business.
In comparing the industrialization of state-owned, collective-owned, and private businesses. Chow and
Fung (1996) found that the rapid growth of the non-state enterprises in China was in fad the driving force
of rapid employment and output. The number of private businesses in Shanghai grew more than 29% in 1996
and 38% in 1998. In addition. Ngo. Lau. and Chow (1994) also found similar growth in non-state firms in
a rapidly developing province of China. Official statistics indicated ihat the gross industrial output value of
the private sector was 25% of the total economy in 1994. jumped to 36% in 1997 and 40% in 1998 (China
Statistical Yearbook. 1999). The number of employees in private businesses and individuals was 68 million
in 1997. and 78 million in 1998 (China Statistical Yearbook. 1999).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->Cultural values, social context, and personal variables are thought to influence enterpreneudal cognition (Morse et al., 1999). Cognition in turn can affect how entrepreneurs create, sustain, and transform organizations and their intentions to grow. This
study partially tests the model developed by Busenitz and Lau (1996). referred to here
as "entrepreneurial growth intentions." We examine how the social context and personal variables, together with cognition, influence growth intentions of private business
owners. Figure i outlines the conceptual framework that guides this study.

Cognitive Outcomes
Cognition and the information-processing perspective of understanding organizational behavior focuses on how individuals interpret information from their surrounding
environment (Salancik & Pfeffer. 1978). The study of entrepreneurial cognition has

<-----Page 3----->primarily focused on decision-making heuristics (Baron. 1998; Busenitz & Barney,
1997) and enactment of environment (Katz. 1992; Shaver & Scott, 1991). Since the
decisions facing entrepreneurs entail much uncertainty and complexity, the schema and
heuristics used by them become an economizing mechanism for decision making.
As cognitive structures and heuristics are used to assess the environment, the processed information then results in an evaluation of the situation and the intention to (or
not to) pursue specific venture activities. Hence, an understanding of the environment is
an enactment outcome of the cognitive process (Tyler & Steen.sma, 1998; Walsh, 1995).
Examining the cognitive structure and process usually requires a complex design that is
difficult to examine with large-scale quantitative surveys. Consequently, in this study,
we focus on the cognitive outcome (the perceived business future) as seen by the small
business owners rather than the actual cognitive process. While this represents a variation of the Busenitz and Lau model, it nevertheless provides a more powerful test of the
intention outcome.

Social Context
Social context and the business environment that small business owners face have
been found to affect the emergence of entrepreneurial activity and behavior (Kim, Hurh,
& Fernandez, 1989; Reynolds, 1991). The Busenitz and Lau (1996) model suggests that
specific societal contexts, such as market conditions, career mobility, and network affect
the cognition of entrepreneurs. In addition, the perception of an environment conducive
to new venture creation could also impact entrepreneurial intentions.
As the Chinese economy moves toward a more market-oriented approach, the business environment has become more complex and dytiamic. As globalization and variations in govetTiment intervention increase, small business owners will have varying
perceptions and interpretations of the business future (Ahlstrom et al., 2000). Since
entrepreneurial cognition is a function of how market conditions are perceived, the
business owners' intentions to grow an existing business or keep it as it is, will be
generated through cognitive structures and processes (Busenitz & Lau, 1996).
Following this argument, we propose that personal business experiences and better
social networks will be positively related to entrepreneurial growth intentions. Since the
environment is so dynamic, the learning effects resulting from more personal business
experiences will reduce the perceived uncertainties. Furthermore, individuals with better
ethnic or social networks are likely to create more effective business operations because
of their network connections (guanxi) (Xin & Pearce, 1996). Network-based strategies
have been considered appropriate in transitional economics, especially in the Chinese
context (Chen, 1999; Peng & Heath. 1996). Shen and Lau (2000) also suggest that
networks can provide the necessary human and social capital for enterprise development.
Hi A: Intentions to grow will be positively related to the owner's social context, such
as market conditions, social network, and business experiences.
Similarly, when business owners decide on a growth mode, we suspect that cooperation with other firms is a common way of enlarging their resource base. For example,
one of the most important elements of success for K. P. Chen, one of China's most
successful entrepreneurs, was his ability to form collaborative arrangements with foreign
firms (Lee, 1998). Thus, a perceived favorable market condition should be related to
higher propensity to collaborate with other firms. A better social network would also
enhance the effectiveness of cooperation. We argue here that social context will positively affect entrepreneurial intentions to grow and develop cooperative arrangements
with other firms.

network, and business experiences.

Perceived Difficulties with Firm Growth
The above hypotheses are developed from an enacted 'favorable' environment and
social network perspective. However, while private firms have played a major role in
China's econoinic growth, difficulties clearly exist with growing a small business (Ahlstrom et al., 2000). Problems with government intervention in the fonn of new regulations or a changing tax structure are common (Kontorovich, 1999; Lau et al., 1999). If
market conditions are perceived to be unfavorable, then the impact is likely to be
negative. Difficulties in obtaining sales, dealing with fierce competition, or encountering
a labor shortage are external factors that signal unfavorable market conditions and a poor
business future. Small business owners with these perceptions are unlikely to grow the
business, or may even cease operations.
Perceived difficulties may also be associated with inadequate internal resotirces such
as insufficient technical expertise. These are important factors to consider in expansion
decisions (Chow & Fung, 1996). If the owner has the confidence that the difficulties are
solvable (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Wright, Hoskisson, Busenitz, & Dial, 2000), then
there is likely to be an intention to grow the business. One way of obtaining critical
resources is through cooperation with other firms (Ahlslrom et al., 2000). Assuming that
an appropriate partner can be found, resources such as financing, marketing skills, or
technical skills can be obtained. We suspect that this will be especially true when foreign
firms are the intended partners. More specifically, we suspect that perceived difficulties
impact business owners' judgment regarding future growth and means of expansion. We
test the following hypotheses;
H2A: Perceived difficulties with current business conditions will be negatively
related to intention to grow.
H2B; Perceived difficulties with current business conditions will be negatively related to intention to develop cooperative arrangements with other firms.
H2C: Perceived difficulties with current resource constraints will be positively related to intention to grow.
H2D: Perceived difficulties with current resource constraints will be positively related to intention to develop cooperative arrangements with other firms.

Individual Variahles
Researchers have frequently investigated individual differences and their potential
relationship with attitudes and firm behavior. Both demographic and individual difference factors continue to receive attention in entrepreneur ship research (e.g., Honig,
1998; Robinson & Sexton, 1994). A variety of individual difference variables such as
need for achievement, tolerance for ambiguity, and need for conformity have been
examined (Begley & Boyd, 1987; Miner. Smith, & Bracker. 1989; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). We postulate here that higher need for achievement and higher need for
monetary rewards will have positive relationships with an intention to grow a start-up
and to engage in cooperative arrangements with other firms.
We also predict that the demographic factors, age, education, and gender will have
a significant impact on growth intentions. Age has been examined from a couple of
Fall, 2001

9

<-----Page 5----->perspectives. Valuable experience can come with age, but younger business owners can
also benefit from higher levels of energy and stamina (Sapienza & Grimm. 1997). Since
this study controls for business experience, we argue that age will be inversely related to
firm growth. Research has generally concluded that education is advantageous in giving
the entrepreneur an edge in achieving firm growth (see Cooper & Gason, 1992). Thus,
we expect education to be positively related to firm growth. As for gender, it appears that
women usually operate smaller businesses (Honig. 1998). but it is unknown if growth
intentions are affected by gender.
Individual commitment influences the formation and structure of schema, and hence
the cognitive outcomes (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Lau & Woodman. 1995). Thus, we
suspect that the owners' commitment to tbeir business has an important impact on
growth intentions. By cooperating with other firms, new resources could be acquired. For
example, foreign firms would normally provide technology and financial capital, while
state-owned firms would provide the necessary human connections. In this way. cooperation increases the probability of success. Cooperative arrangements with other firms
are also likely to enlarge market opponunities for those who are more cominitted to their
businesses.
H3A: Need for achievement and monetary rewards and commitment will have
positive relationships with intention to grow.
H3B: Need for achievement and monetary rewards and commitment will have positive relationships with intention to develop cooperative arrangements with
other firms.

METHODS
Most Westerners have focused their research in China on state businesses or joint
ventures (Bruton et al.. 2000). Given the lack of systematic data on private business
owners in China, our understanding of how these business owners think and operate is
very limited. This under-researched domain can be largely attributed to the difficulty
researchers have in gaining access to large samples of entrepreneurs. Earlier research on
business activity in China usually relied on published government statistical yearbooks
to gain insights into this business environment. One exception is a large-scale national
survey of private busine.ss owners that was conducted in 1991 by the State Economic
System Reform Committee and State Industry and Commerce Administration. The survey sampled over 8,500 businesses throughout China. The firms were sampled randomly
based on a stratified sampling of cities, towns, villages, and industries. All owners had
over one year's operation at the time of the survey. It wa.s the first survey of private
business owners on this scale. This data set has now been made available to researchers
at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Through the assistance of the University
Service Centre of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the original data set was
electronically coded. The survey consisted of two parts. The first part of the questionnaire was completed by the private business owner, and the second part by the government officials in charge of business registration. The data were also logically checked to
ensure internal consistency by cross-validating the owners' responses with those of the
government officials. For example, the sales turnover figures were compared between
the two respondents concerned and no significant differences were found. Because of the
use of this database, cultural values couid not be studied. Positively, this allows for the
control of variation in cultural values.
While the original study sampled getihu and siying qiye enterprises, the current study
focused on the siying qiye portion of the dataset. which comprised a total of 2.878 firms.
Siying qiye means 'private enterprises' in Chinese, which is defined as a profit-making

<-----Page 6----->economic entity employing at least eight individuals with private ownership. This ownership may be in the form of proprietorship, partnership, or limited liability company.
Such organizations are free to set up joint ventures with other economic organizations,
within or outside China. Getihu was excluded in the sample because of our interest in
growth intentions. They are very small in size (often only 2-3 persons) and are very
unstable in the transitional economy. The siying qiye entrepreneur or private business
owner in the current analysis averaged 3.7 years in their capacities as owners (median is
4 years, the range is 1 to 12 years). The median size of the sample of private businesses
was 10 people.

Social Context Variables
Business experience, in this study, refers to the number of years the respondent has
been a private business owner. The market conditions were measured through a government administrator's independent evaluation of the business situation, conducted
separately from the survey of the owners, thus avoiding a self-report bias problem. The
survey administrator evaluated whether or not there was convenient traffic by the business and whether or not the business was located in a very populated area. Both variables
were dummy coded as "0" if no and " 1 " if yes. If one or the other of these two questions
was answered yes. market conditions-convenient or busy was coded as " 1 " . If both
questions were answered as yes, market conditions-convenient and busy was coded as
"T*. In addition, social network in this study is represented by the owner's affiliation
with the communist party. Being a party member is often perceived to be important in
terms of the guwixi (connection) concept among mainland Chinese (Luo, 1997; Tsui &
Farh, 1997; Xin & Pearce. 1996). With the influences of both socialist and coUectivist
thinking, it is easier to grow a business if appropriate connections with government
officials and party people are made. Shen and Lau (2000) suggest that party secretaries
possess the needed social and human capital for effective business operations. Thus,
party membership would be necessary for effective networking.
The variables involving perceived difficulties in their existing business were based
on the owner's perceptions of problems in specific areas. The areas of difficulty analyzed
were sales, operational facilities, competition, uncertainty of government policy, borrowings from banks, and labor shortage. All responses to these variables were in a yes/no
format based on whether or not the owner saw these as a current issue. All yes responses
were coded as " 1 " for analysis purposes in our dummy coding schema. While interval
scales increase the variance of the data, dichotomous coding had to be used with this data
set, a limitation of this study.

Individual Variables
Individual needs were measured in terms of the owners' self-reported objectives of
starting a business. Respondents were asked to indicate their objective for starting the
business. Two kinds of needs were indicated: the need for achievement and the need for
monetary rewards. The need for achievement was identified by the owner's indication of
the objective of using one's talent and expectation of getting excellent performance. The
need for monetary rewards was an indication of the objective of making a living or for
earning more money. The owner commitment to new venture was measured by the
number of hours the owner spent in the business per day. The demographic variables of
the owners such as age. education, and gender were available from the interviewee's
demographic profile.

Cognitive Outcomes

<-----Page 7----->terms of their plans for the near-term future of the running of the business. They reported
different options, including expanding the business, remaining unchanged, downsizing
or closing down the business, working with state-owned firms, and cooperating with
foreign companies. The owners' growth intention for the business was analyzed by
contrasting those that planned to expand the business with those remaining unchanged
(Model I) and those downsizing or closing the business (Model 2). The method of
expansion was analyzed by contrasting those owners who foresaw their business as
remaining essentially unchanged versus those cooperating with foreign firms (Model 3)
and those cooperating with state-owned firms (Model 4).
This analysis also included several variables to control for alternative explanations,
including the size of the business in terms of initial paid-in capital, current number of
employees, and sales turnover. The inclusion of these variables should reduce confounding effects due to the amount of start-up capital and business size.

RESULTS
The profile of our sample of small business owners is listed in Table I. The de.scriptives of the independent and dependent variables are provided in Table 2. Tables 3
and 4 report the results of the four regression models. Since our dependent variable of
entrepreneurial growth intention is categorical (expanding versus remaining unchanged,
etc.), the logistic regression procedure was employed. The first two analy.ses focused on
growth intention. We analyzed the effects of social and individual factors on whether the
small business owners intended to keep their businesses as is (remain unchanged) versus
to expand or downsize and close-down. Cases wilh some missing data were excluded
from the analysis. The control variable employee number was significant in all four
regression equations.
Model 1 in Table 3 contrasted the intention to expand versus remain unchanged. The
overall model chi-square was 147.97 with a correct hit rate of 65.66%. Expansion was
coded as T in the analysis, therefore, positive coefficients mean positive relationships
with expansion. Both market conditions variables have significant and positive relationships with remaining unchanged. Thus, the better the market situation (in busy districts),
the higher the probability of the overall intention to expand. In addition, several perceived difficulties have impacts on the decision to grow. Those that affect their intention
to grow positively were borrowing and operational facilities. Those that affect their
intention to remain unchanged were difficulties in sales and labor shortage. The other
perceived difficulties (competition and uncertainty about government policy) had no
significant effects.
Among the individual variables, age of business owners, needs, and working hours
were found to be significant. The younger the owner and the longer hours one worked
(thus higher commitment), the higher the intention to grow. Interestingly, both need for
achievement and need for monetary rewards were significant, but in opposite directions.
Need for achievement was positively related to expansion intention, but need for monetary reward was negative.
Model 2 in Table 3 contrasts the intention to expand (coded as !) versus to downsize
or close-down the business. The model's chi-square is 76.01 with a hit ratio of over 81%.
The control variables paid-in capital and employee size were significant. In terms of the
social context variables, perceived difficulties in sales, operational facilities, and labor
shortage were significant. The results were similar to the previous model, except perceived borrowing difficulties was non-significant. Additionally, need for achievement
was negatively related to expansion while age was negatively related, indicating that
younger owners are more growth oriented.

In testing Hypothesis lA, these two logistic regressions show that the perceived
market conditions were found to have a positive relationship with the intention to grow
only in model 1, contrasting growth versus remaining unchanged. Social network and
business experience were non-significant in both models.
The perceived difficulties of competition and government policy were nonsignificant in both models. However, difficulties in future sales and labor shortage would
influence their decision to remain unchanged or even downsize and close down the
business. Hypothesis 2A is supported. In addition, consistent with Hypothesis 2B, the
perceived difficulties in operational facilities and borrowing were positively related to
expansion intention. Limitation in physical facilities is understandably a legitimate reason to expand. These owners would probably be aware of borrowing difficulties and they
are confident that they can overcome this difficulty through cooperation, so they are
attempting to expand.
Regarding individual variables (Hypothesis 3A), need for achievement was positively related to expansion in both models, as predicted, while the need for monetary
rewards was negatively related to expansion, but significant only in the case of expand
versus remaining unchanged. Age bad consistent predictive power, while education and
gender were not significant in both models. The commitment of the owner in terms of
working hours was significant only in model 1.
Logistic regression models 3 and 4 reported in Table 4 examine the means of future
growth by contrasting the effects of those variables on remain unchanged (coded as 0)
versus cooperate with foreign firms (model 3) and cooperate with state-owned firms

(model 4). Both of these models had a hit ratio of over 87% along with significant model
chi-squares. Again, a positive coefficient means a positive relationship with the intentions to cooperate. The market conditions and social network were not significantly
related to cooperating with either foreign or state-owned firms, and only years of business experiences was positively related to the desire to work with foreign firms. Business
experience was positively related to working with foreign firms.
For perceived business condition and resource constraints, difficulties in borrowing
and uncertain government policy were positively and significantly related to a desire to
develop cooperative arrangements with both foreign and state-owned firms. Perceived
difficulty with operational facilities also encourages Chinese small business owners to
cooperate with foreign firms. Perceived competition was not related to cooperative
intentions. As expected, difficulty in sales was significantly negative. This was consistent with the previous results where perceived difficulty in sales was related to the
intentions to remain unchanged, that is, no expansion or cooperation. Hypothesis 2C and
2D are supported.
In further observing the results reported in Table 4, the need for monetary reward
was significant only in regards to cooperation with state firms (model 4). Interestingly
enough, the direction of the relationship was negative indicating that the need for monetary rewards was inversely related to cooperation with state firms. Need for achievement was not significant in either model 3 or 4. However, owner commitment had a
positive relationship with the intention to cooperate with both foreign and state-owned
firms. Education level was also positively related to the intention to cooperate with
foreign firms. Essentially, the needs argument for Hypothesis 2B is not .supported;
however, other commitment and demographic influences do receive significant support.

DISCUSSION
The first set of analyses addressed the issue of expansion. Younger business owners
with a higher need for achievement, greater commitment, and perceived limitations in
physical facilities were more likely to expand. Perceived difficulties in sales and labor
shortage were found to be associated with no growth and even downsizing. This finding

is consistent with our hypotheses that social and individual variables were significant
predictors of entrepreneurial intentions. However, it is also important to note that different factors have varying effects on how they expect their firms to grow. These results
suggest that perceived difficulties, market conditions, and a high level of commitment
consistently affect growth decisions.
Business owners' perceived difficulties in bank borrowing and uncertain government
polices were significant predictors of cooperative arrangements with other firms. Cooperation appears to be very important for pursuing growth opportunities in a transitional
economy like China's. If bank borrowings were perceived to be difficult, linkages with
other firms were apparently a means to accessing the needed resources. This is especially
true when uncertain government policies were anticipated in the future. Cooperating with
state-owned firms would minimize future negative impacts. This may also help explain
why difficulty in bank borrowings was related to the intention to expand. Acquiring

additional financial resources through working with other firms could potentially resolve
this problem. Working with foreign firms will certainly enhance the product image and
market exposure, turning difficulties into opportunities. Thus, these findings challenge
the belief that having lending difficulties inhibits a business owner's desire to grow a
business. Future research should further probe this interesting finding.
Our findings with perceived difficulties in sales are also interesting. When owners
are pessimistic about future sales, they tend not to expand or cooperate with other finns.
Unlike the difficulties in borrowings and facilities, difficulties in sales was perceived as
a real threat. This is consistent with the cognitive perspective that each event or attribute
is evaluated differently in each person's schema (Busenitz & Lau, 1996). Thus, an
important finding from this study is that different difficulties have varying effects. Some
difficuities are seen as a threat while others end up being an opportunity.
It is interesting to note thai these data suggest that the social context variables have
16

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->limited effects. The social network was not found to have any affect on business decisions. With social network used as a proxy for the connection {guanxi) concept, these
data indicate that connections do not have an impact on growth and expansion decisions.
On the contrary, the market conditions were a better predictor of expansion intention. In
a transition economy, this might signify the increasing importance of market forces
versus estahlished social connections.
The need for monetary reward was not related to the intention to expand, as predicted, but rather in a negative direction when expansion versus remain unchanged was
contrasted. This may be due to the risk associated with expansions in unsteady markets.
Business owners apparently think that staying the course will lead to higher income. In
the decision to cooperate with state-owned firms, we found an inverse relationship
between the need for monetary reward and the preference for alliances. In transitional
markets, linking with foreign firms may be better than cooperating with state-owned
firms. There does seem to be a positive relationship between the commitment of the
small business owners and expansion. The consistent significances of this variable indicate that motivation and commitment are important forces in venture development.
Regarding the control variables, firm size consistently affects expansion decisions
and working with other firms. More specifically, the larger the existing husiness in terms
of the number of etnployees, the higher the likelihood to expand and work with other
firms. Future work on this area should continue to control for firm size. Moreover, it
seems that smaller firms have little desire to grow or cooperate with others.
This research is the first large sample study of private business owners in China.
Although the data appear to be reliable according to our checks, these data were not
specifically collected for testing the developed hypotheses. Consequently, a limitation of
this study is that we had to use some proxy variables to estimate the relationships of
specific phenomena. Furthermore, many variables were dichotomous or categorical, thus
restricting our measurement range. While this minimizes some of the power of this
study, it does not make our finding a conservative estimate. When it becomes possible,
future studies should be conducted to provide meaningful and longitudinal data for more
in-depth examination of related issues. Further, becau.se there could be regional differences within China, future research should measure the cultural differences in different
regions and hence provide a more comprehensive test of the cross-cultural model.
Another limitation of this study is that the data were collected in 1991. Changes in
the Chinese economy continue to occur. In 1997, additional efforts were made to further
reform state-owned firms, which again alters the market structure of the economy (Chen
& Lau. 2000; Lau, 1998). If the Chinese government continues to relax constraints on
conducting such studies, future research should be able to pursue inquiry in greater
depth.

CONCLUSION

'

Our study has confirmed some of the hypotheses adapted from the Busenitz and Lau
(1996) model that social and individual variables have important relationships on cognitive outcome of entrepreneurial growth intentions. In a transitional economy such as
China's, the relationships appear to hold true. China is moving from a centrally planned
economy toward one with growing business opportunities. However, the uncertain market conditions and constraints still imposed by the PRC government need to be taken into
account when small business owners consider growth opportunities. This study demonstrates that the interpretation of market situation by private business owners is positively
related to growth intentions and the means to accomplish that growth. Not only are
owners' commitment, need for achievement, and social context important, but a cognitive understanding of the environment is directly related to growth intentions.

<-----Page 13----->This study has attempted to enhance our understanding of how entrepreneurs think
and how their thinking is related to the ventures they lead. This large sample study with
PRC subjects attempts to explore the cognitive perspective of entrepreneurs in a transition economy. If and when specific data can be collected on the cognitive make-up of
private business owners in China, the findings of this study should be further explored
with more targeted measures.
