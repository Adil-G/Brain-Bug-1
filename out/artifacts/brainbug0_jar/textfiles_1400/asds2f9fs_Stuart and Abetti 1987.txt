TOWARDS THE PREDICTION
OF INITIAL SUCCESS·

There are numerous studies on new product activities that try to measure the relative impact of different factors on success or failure. The
research on new ventures is less comprehensive, and often only a
few items are considered. This article reports on the early results from a
research program that is combining the research on both new products
and new ventures, to come up with a more comprehensive evaluation of
relative success factors.
The literature was reviewed to determine the most significant factors found in prior work. A
68-item questionnaire was developed and used with the chief executives of 24 new technical ventures,
all associated with the RPI Incubator or Technology Park. Ten of the 17 factors investigated yielded
reliable measurements, which were then subjected to stepwise regression analysis to determine the
relative impact of each factor on the two success measurements used: Initial Quantified Success and
Initial Subjective Success. (It should be recognized that Initial Success does not necessarily predict
ultimate success, an area to be investigated in continuing studies.) The two success measurements
were not correlated and the correlations with the independent variables were therefore different.
Initial Quantified Success showed a strong negative correlation with market attractiveness.
Companies entering smaller or more slowly growing markets were doing better than those in the
larger, faster-growing markets. Initial Quantified Success was positively correlated with the level of
Entrepreneurial Characteristics exhibited by the leader(s). These were the only two variables exhibiting
significant relationships with quantified success.
Initial Subjective Success was negatively correlated with Market Dynamism rather than Market
Attractiveness. Negative correlation was also measured with both R&D Intensity and the Organic
Nature of the firm. This latter finding is contrary to much of the new product literature, which

emphasizes the need for individual independence and initiative. Such may be the case with new products
or ventures within large organizations. but in small independent ventures the entrepreneur should
provide strong control and guidance. A positive correlation was observed with the Entrepreneurial
Characteristics and also with the degree of match between the firm's experience and the new business
requirements.
No significant correlation was observed with J) Product or Service Uniqueness. 2) Gross Margin.
or 3) Strategic Aggressiveness. The lack of correlation with these variables is surprising, but it may
be due to the small size of the sample.
The research confirmed two items that are understood by most scholars and experienced practitioners: the importance of the entrepreneur and the importance of pursuing new ventures that match
the technical and market experience of the team.
The less obvious results are those that suggest that success is favored by strong review and
control by the entrepreneur rather than the development of employee initiative and independence.
Also, the initial success appears to be coming more readily to firms in more slowly growing or less
dynamic markets. it will take an expanded sample and a longer time horizon to determine if these
initial trends continue to ultimate success.

INTRODUCTION
We are developing a research program to investigate the major factors contributing to success
in new technical ventures. The ultimate goal is to establish a theoretical and empirical
framework for determining, at the earliest possible stage,
1. the longer-range success potential of a new high-technology venture, and
2. the most effective entrepreneurial and managerial techniques to realize this potential.
During the first stage of our research, a prepilot study of 15 small start-up firms, all
associated with the RPI Incubator Program, was conducted during the summer of 1984
(Stuart and Abetti 1985). Since all the firms interviewed were, at that time, less than 3 years
old, we did not believe that it would be possible to measure business success in the conventional terms of sales, profits, return on equity, market share, etc. Therefore, this first
study concentrated on measuring four selected company and environmental characteristics
and establishing correlations between the independent variable: the characteristics of the
market served, and three company variables: strategy, organization, and degree of innovation.
Our initial results yielded a strong correlation between the market and innovation or
strategy (R 2 = 0.60 and R2 = 0.58, respectively). That is, companies serving highly dynamic and rapidly growing markets in general had adopted dynamic and innovative strategies
to launch more radical innovations, while companies serving mature and stable markets
relied on static and conservative strategies to offer incremental innovations. We also noted
a surprising lack of correlation between organizational characteristics and the market served
(R 2 = 0.02). In addition, most companies exhibited a good match between the various
characteristics, while some showed a wide divergence between their strategy, innovation,
and organization characteristics.
Contingency "fit" theories suggest that companies with higher success potential would:
1. adopt strategies, innovations, and organizational procedures in consonance with the served
markets, and
2. show congruence of company characteristics.
However, we recognized that the first study was not sufficient and that additional variables
needed to be included in the analysis. A more detailed field study, including more quantitative

<-----Page 2----->PREDICTING START-UP SUCCESS

217

measurements, more in-depth statistical analysis, and a larger sample was needed to establish
the correlation between initial success and company characteristics.
Our second study was conducted during the summer and fall of 1985, one year after
the first. Thanks to the excellent progress of the RPI Incubator Program and of the RPI
Technology Park (Abetti, LeMaistre, and Wallace 1986), we had at our disposal a homogeneous sample of new ventures, all less than 7 years old, of relatively small size (1-25
employees), striving largely to develop and market original technological innovations, or to
provide innovative technical services. Also, many of these companies had already started
production, registered their first sales, and obtained outside financing from local banks,
government agencies, venture capitalists, or other sources. The principals of these companies
considered these achievements as harbingers of success.
On the basis of our previous contacts and the availability of the chief executives for
interviews, we interviewed a sample of 24 new technical ventures, of which 19 were startup firms and 5 were new internal ventures of larger companies. This second sample included
10 of the 15 companies of our first study. The goal of the present study is to establish a
correlation between
1. the dependent variable: initial success, and
2. the independent variables: the characteristics of the market, the company and of the
entrepreneur( s).
To do this, we had to quantify and measure these variables. To start with, what is success?

WHAT IS SUCCESS?
The literature on successful technological innovations, new products, entrepreneurial small
business, and high-technology ventures is very extensive (Kelly and Kransberg 1978; OECD
1971; Maidique 1985; Crawford 1979). Definitions of success can be classified along various
dimensions.
1. Subjective versus Objective. For instance, in Project New Prod, managers were asked to

select a pair of products, one successful, one unsuccessful, according to their judgment
(Cooper 1979). In the Stanford Project, products that produced positive cash flow were
deemed successful, the others unsuccessful (Maidique and Zirger 1984).
2. Bimodal, Multimodal versus Continuous. Initial studies, such as Sappho (Science Policy
Research Unit 1972), classified innovations as successful or unsuccessful. Later studies
included various degrees of success or lack of success. For instance, a Canadian study
classifies companies as unsuccessful, marginal, or successful (Litvak and Maule 1980).
Maidique and Zirger (1984) use a seven-level scale to categorize the degree of product
success based on the returns achieved. Other studies use continuous variables such as
sales growth (Meyer and Roberts 1986), time period to positive cash flow, return on
investment or equity, etc. (Weiss 1981).
3. Financial versus Nonfinancial. Financial measures are easily identifiable, while nonfinancial measures range from increase in employment to contributions to society, or to
the learning process of the firm. For instance, Maidique and Zirger (1985) pointed out
that many products that were financially not successful could actually be called successful
in nonfinancial terms, inasmuch as these contributed to the learning cycle of the firm
and to subsequent highly successful products.

<-----Page 3----->218

R. STUART AND P.A. ABETTI

4. Meeting or Not Meeting Expectations. Finally, success can be defined as meeting expectations (usually management's), regardless of the amount of realism versus wishful
thinking, or conservative versus challenging goal setting, which went into the formulation
of such expectations. Thus, Maidique and Zirger (1985) state
Success is defined as the achievement of something desired, planned or attempted. While
financial return is one of the most easily quantifiable industrial parameters, it is far from
the only important one.

and Crawford (1979) concludes
The only real solution lies in the firm's expectations-sales and profit forecasts.

In our study we are dealing with new companies, or separate internal new ventures
of larger firms, and therefore it is relatively easy to segregate quantitative measures of
success, such as financial data, growth in sales and employment, etc. However, we encounter
here an additional dimension: the time span over which to measure success.
It is well known that most small businesses fail or exit in the first years, while the
survival ratio of high-technology ventures funded by venture capitalists is higher, thanks to
the careful selection process (Timmons 1985). Thus, one measure of company success could
simply be survival. In fact, such a definition is used in a recent national survey of Incubators
by David Allen (1985):
Success is defined as a business that leaves the incubator after several years and continues
operation; failure is defined as a business that discontinues operation while in the incubator
facility.

In contrast, venture capitalists are well aware that, as a general rule, it takes seven
years to "cash in" on an investment and thereby proclaim success (Wall Street Journal 1982).
A recent study of 218 investments made during the 1970s found that 40% resulted in total
or partial losses while only 12% resulted in spectacular gains (about 25% compounded ROI
after taxes) (Timmons et al. 1985).
Strictly speaking, an investment can be called financially successful only if its returns
are commensurate with the risk as compared to alternative investment opportunities (Mansfield et al. 1971, 1975). In view of the high technical, commercial, and financial risks
assumed by start-up firms, a ROI of 25% a year (3-4 times the present bank interest rates)
appears justified. Thus, a strict measure of success of a start-up venture could be: Did it
achieve an ROI of 25%/year after 7 years? Obviously, such a rigorous measure of success
is not applicable to our sample of firms, with median age of 2 years.
Therefore, rather than success, we chose to measure "initial success" in two ways: (I)
quantifiable and (2) subjective. Initial quantified success is measured as a combination of
sales and employment growth, profitability, return on equity, sales/employee and sales/assets.
The company responses were classified into five numerical ranges indicative of differing
levels of success and then averaged to provide an overall measure of initial quantified success.
Initial subjective success is measured as a combination of attaining original expectations,
probability of survival, ability to attract outside capital, employee satisfaction, and contributions to society. The responses were classified according to a descriptive Likert-like scale
(1-5) and averaged to measured initial subjective success. We are well aware that initial
success may not guarantee long-term success. Some companies, like shooting stars, may
leave a short trail of glory and glamour, before they vanish in the darkness of night.
Nonetheless, initial success is often a prerequisite for attracting new customers, maintaining

<-----Page 4----->PREDICTING START-UP SUCCESS

219

a steady flow of capital, and confirming to the entrepreneurs and employees that their initial
sacrifices will be amply rewarded.
Having thus established measurements of the dependent variable (initial success) we
tum to the independent variables, the critical factors that contribute to the success of new
technical ventures.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO INITIAL SUCCESS
The literature on the factors that contribute to success-c-or failure-s-of entrepreneurs, small
businesses, corporations, technological innovations, new products, and new ventures is very
extensive (Tornatsky et al. 1983; Kelly and Kranzberg 1978). It includes descriptive and
prescriptive writings, conceptual models, case studies, field surveys, comparative case studies, longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, etc. While many of these contributions may be
relevant to our research, we are primarily concerned with those papers that address the
factors contributing to success of new high-technology products and/or ventures, as suggestive of success potential in our sample.
We have attempted to group into major categories and subcategories the multitude of
factors enumerated in the literature. We then perused what we believed to be the most
relevant factors for our investigation and indicated in Table I whether these or comparable
factors had been evaluated to be of significant importance for the success of the product or
new venture. Blanks indicate that the particular factor had not been evaluated or had not
shown statistical significance. A composite rating is also shown in the last column, which
is the sum of the number of entries in each line.
Unfortunately, the definitions of these variables are often unclear or divergent. Therefore, we will now present our interpretation of each subcategory, taking as examples ideal
cases that maximize the measure of that specific category, as a combination of selected
measured variables.
I. An (ideally) attractive market (high MA factor) is reasonably large, predictable and
quantifiable, in the early stage of its life cycle, growing rapidly, and is part of a favorable
sociopolitical environment. The customers identity and needs are clear, gross margins
are high, and competitors are few. (An ideally nonattractive market has the opposite
characteristics-this same principle holds for all the following variables.)
2. A highly dynamic market (MD) is in a stage of rapid, perhaps chaotic evolution, with
numerous product and technological innovations, a high number of competitors and low
entry barriers, unclear product requirements, and the need for specialized as opposed
to standardized products.
3. A unique innovation (IU) is embodied into an original or unique product, process,
system, or service; it is specialized or customized, beyond the state-of-the-art, based
on proprietary and patentable technology or on complex systems engineering, and R&D
requirements are high.
4. The value ofthe innovation (IV) to the customer/user is high if it offers unique advantages
or a high benefit/cost ratio in terms of functions, operating efficiency, investment and
expense savings, etc.
5. The gross margin of the innovation (OM) is high if the gross margin of the product,
as developed and marketed by the supplier, is high.
6. The venture's strategy is highly aggressive (SA) if it is clear, highly offensive, first to
the market with new products, processes or services, and has high R&D and/or Sales
& Marketing efforts.

7. The R&D intensity (RI) is high if the R&D expenditures are high (relative to sales and
the competitors') and the strategic emphasis is on technology.
8. The venture's marketing intensity (MI) is high if the strategic emphasis is on marketing
and the market research, and advertising and sales expenditures are higher than the
competitors'. Also, the coupling with customers or potential customers is very close.
9. The compatibility (CO) of the new venture is high if it is congruent with the company's
image, culture, product experience, and general approach to the marketplace, and if it
utilizes the existing knowledge-base and skills in technology, marketing, etc.
10. The organic emphasis (OE) of the venture is high if the organizational structure is
simple, with limited review and control mechanisms, free communications, and a high
degree of self-control. The company's environment and culture are entrepreneurial,
opportunistic, and risk taking. There are task forces and teams with regular interaction,
and high incentives are offered to all employees.
II. The outside coupling (OC) level is high if there are frequent interactions with customers
and outside consultants, and if outside technology is easily transferred to the company.
12. The effectiveness (EF) of the venture is high if the original development plans and
schedules are met and the product (process or service) is immediately accepted by the
customers.
13. The entrepreneurship (EN) level is high if the top leadership's approach is informal
and driven by the opportunity. The entrepreneur(s) have high tolerance of ambiguity,
persistance, and perseverance; are enthusiastic and dynamic leaders with high networking
and communication abilities; show creativity, need for personal independence, belief
in the control over their own destiny, and emphasize unique accomplishments over the
stability and well-being of the group.
14. The experience (EX) level of the top leadership is high if they are very familiar and
experienced with the technology and the market, have run their own companies, or
have general management experience.
15. The teaming (TE) level is high if the top leadership consists of a well-balanced team,
of three or more persons, with all the functions represented and each with major
responsibilities.

We developed 68 questions to probe each of the noted components of the various subcategories. The answers were presented on a Likert-like scale (1-5) with a series of descriptive
or numerical responses indicative of the relative magnitude of the particular component. The

response possibilities were designed to establish a common basis of understanding, and
wherever possible, numeric ranges were indicated. The Appendix includes extracts from the
questionnaire indicating typical questions and response options. The complete questionnaire
is available from the lead author. The value for each company in the particular subcategory
characteristic was then estimated as the average of the responses to the individual items.
The questionnaire was used in a personal interview with the chief executive of each
of the organizations. As previously noted, all of the firms are associated with the RPI
Incubator Facility or the RPI Technology Park. Nineteen of the 24 companies are new
independent ventures, and five are separate new-product/new-business activities of established firms. Six of the firms were computer/software oriented, six were developing advanced
instrumentation, four were engineering design/service oriented, three were biotechnology
oriented, and the rest were active in other technical business areas. The range, mean, and
median of the more readily quantified company characteristics are noted in Table 2. Eleven
of the firms were profitable, five breaking even, and eight still in a loss position.

In two cases, we were able to get answers from two principals, and the inter-rater
reliability was quite high (p = 0.58). On six of the questions we had differently phrased
but essentially duplicate questions and the reliability of the responses was also quite high,
with an average Cronbach a = 0.75. The reliability of the characteristic measurements on
each of the subcategories described varied somewhat, as noted in Table 3. Those measurements with an a value over 0.5 are deemed adequate for exploratory research (Nunnally
and Durham, 1975), but those with values under 0.5 are questionable.
To explore further the possible interactions of the individual answers, a principal
component factor analysis was conducted (SAS Factor, Type Princomp, Varimax Rotation).
The factor analysis provided some confirmation of the variable groupings in that many of
the answers loaded into factors with combinations similar to those used to form the composite
subcategory measurements. However, some of the combinations were not confirmed in the
factor analysis. The characteristic measures with the higher Cronbach a values in Table 3
were confirmed, but those with Iowa values did not appear in the factor analysis, further
suggesting that the measurements on these parameters were inadequate. We therefore dropped
the characteristics with Iowa values «0.5) from further analysis because of low reliability
and lack of factor analysis confirmation. We were unable to identify any new combinations
of variables from the factor analysis.
The composite characteristic measurements were then standardized and a stepwise
regression analysis was performed on the two models, i.e., versus initial quantified success
and versus initial subjective success. The regression coefficients and their statistical levels
of significance are shown in Table 4.

DISCUSSION
The two measures of success (quantified initial success and subjective initial success) were
only weakly correlated (p = 0.15). The regression coefficients were in tum different, as
noted in Table 4.
One of the most surprising results was the strong negative coefficient with market

attractiveness. Many authors have noted the desirability of finding an attractive, especially
a growth market. This led us to review the companies, one by one, and investigate their
relative success and market characteristics. It was clear that, in this sample at least, the
companies that were doing better were not in the larger, more rapidly growing markets.
Rather, they were using technology in more mature stable markets such as technical and
business services, machine tools, consulting or engineering services, etc. The firms in the
more attractive markets were not as yet successful. This negative correlation of quantified
initial success with market attractiveness is perhaps similar to the current condition of the
venture capital and stock markets, wherein there is a disenchantment with the obvious growth
markets. Or perhaps it is a reflection of the time it takes to achieve financial success in the
larger, more rapidly growing markets. Early success may be more readily achieved by
finding appropriate technical and market niches in more stable markets. In a similar vein,
Woo and Cooper (1981) found that effective low-market-share companies tended to occur
in industrial markets characterized by slow growth and infrequent product change rather
than smaller companies prospering in rapidly growing markets with considerable specialized
products as predicted by conventional wisdom. Our new ventures obviously have a low
market share, and therefore, our findings to some extent parallel those of Woo and Cooper.
Entrepreneurship level, that is, a positive response to the majority of the questions
exploring the personal orientation of the leader or leadership teams, exhibited a significant
positive regression coefficient with both the initial quantified success and subjective success.
Of course, this result is not surprising to students and researchers of entrepreneurship and
intrapreneurship. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time that such a relationship
has been measured in quantified terms.
The coefficients developed in the regression relationship with subjective success were
closer to what was anticipated. Although market attractiveness was not a significant factor,
market dynamics entered the relationship in a negative fashion. As noted in Table I, other
research has shown conflicting results, sometimes positive, sometimes negative. Our results
support the latter conclusion. It should be remembered that this negative correlation is
measured versus initial subjective success and may be a reflection of the entrepreneur's
burdens of dealing with the rapid change. Thus the companies may require more time to
become successful.
R&D Intensity showed up surprisingly negative, in opposition to all of the results
cited in Table I. Further reflection suggested agreement with the PIMS data (Schoeffler,
Burrell, and Heany 1974), which showed that R&D intensity on ROI was positive for firms
with high market share but negative for firms with low market share, which certainly is the
case for all of our start-up firms. But again, we are talking about subjective success. It
appears that the entrepreneurs who are making significant investments in R&D are not
satisfied with the progress of the firm toward its business objectives.
Strategic compatibility entered with a strong positive correlation, as expected, and in
agreement with previous work.
The one company organizational characteristic that we were able to measure, namely,
the degree of organic versus mechanistic procedures, showed up negative, again somewhat
surprisingly. However, the difference may be that our research is on small firms, while
much of the literature cited is focused on new-product development within larger, more
mature firms. In such larger firms, it may be necessary to develop an organic environment
to free the innovators from the established patterns. But in small firms such patterns do not
yet exist, and therefore, control is preferred to bring order out of the chaos. In fact Miller
(1983) did find that in small firms entrepreneurship was increased through centralization

<-----Page 10----->PREDICTING START-UP SUCCESS

225

whereas in larger organic firms such was not the case. Similarly, Johne (1984) showed that
experienced product innovators solicit new product ideas openly and informally, but after
a decision has been made to develop a new product, tightly organize the implementation
tasks and monitor progress carefully.
Again, entrepreneurship was a positive contributor to subjective success, as it was to
initial quantified success. This was the one factor that entered into both relationships at
essentially the same level.
The factors that did not enter the relationship were almost as interesting as those that
did. Product uniqueness had been cited by many as necessary. Perhaps this is more important
for new product success than for new venture success. We are not satisfied with this explanation, but it is the best we can offer at this time.
Lack of correlation with gross margin is quite surprising. Strategic aggressiveness also
seemed to play little in the way of a significant role.
It should also be remembered that six other characteristics that were believed to be of
importance were dropped from the analysis because the reliahility values of the measurements
were not satisfactory (see Table 3). These factors could also be playing a part in the success
equation, but we have not yet been able to capture their effects.
Finally, the most important qualifier must be mentioned again, as it was initially. We
are talking about "initial quantified success" and "initial subjective success"-we have not
yet measured real long-term success. That can only be observed with the passage of time,
after these firms have had a chance to expand and mature. In fact, it may well be that initial
quantified or financial success is not a good correlate with ultimate success. Certainly forgoing
necessary development expenses, in order to achieve early profitability, could lead to trouble.
It may be that the more subjective responses of the manager are in fact more appropriate
yardsticks for companies at this early stage. Given the innate optimism of the entrepreneur,
one would suspect that such a measurement would be quite unreliable, but the relationships
based on these more subjective measures appear to be meaningful.

CONCLUSIONS
This study, although preliminary, confirms some well-accepted beliefs and provides some
potentially useful new information for both researchers and practitioners. We will list below
our conclusions, based on the significant variables.

Entrepreneurship
For many years researchers of entrepreneurship and venture capitalists have stated that the
entrepreneur, or better the entrepreneurial team, is the key to the success of new ventures.
Later, the same statement has been made for the "intrapreneur" that is, the entrepreneur
operating within an established company. Our study of new ventures (whether independent
or separate branches of existing companies) confirms the above and, we believe, for the
first time presents significant correlation between initial success and entrepreneurship level.

Compatibility
Similarly, researchers and venture capitalists have stated the importance of the entrepreneurs'
previous experience, knowledge-base, and skills in technology, marketing, etc. We have
extended this concept to compatibility, that is, the congruence of the new venture with the

<-----Page 11----->226

R. STUART AND P.A. ABETTI

company's image, culture, product experience, and general approach to the marketplace,
and shown strong correlation with initial subjective success. We believe that compatibility
is particularly important for the success of new internal ventures, as verified by practical
experience.

Organizational Environment
The negative impact of the organic organizational environment appears to be a new nonobvious relationship. Most of the literature on R&D management, innovation management,
and new product development emphasizes the importance of independence, open communication, limited controls, etc.-and such is the environment in which many technical
entrepreneurs arise and thrive. However, at least in the initial stages of the new venture,
the entrepreneur should learn to exercise tighter control of the organization in order to
improve the probability of success. Some entrepreneurs, based on previous work experience,
may have misgivings about applying rigid controls, but our study shows that such misgivings
are not appropriate.

Market Factors
The negative impact of market factors, that is, market attractiveness and market dynamics,
is surprising. It appears that one can achieve initial success more easily and rapidly in the
more stable, less dynamic markets, by carving and keeping an appropriate market niche.
On the other hand, large, rapidly growing markets offer much higher potential rewards to
the entrepreneur. Thus, our findings of negative correlation between market factors and
initial success may be a time-related phenomenon. By following our sample of firms longitudinally, until final success (or failure) is achieved, we should be able to clarify the
possible dichotomy between initial and ultimate success in different types of markets. Alternatively, different success criteria might be developed for judging firms' initial performance in different market environments. Such criteria would certainly be useful to venture
capitalists, managers, and students of entrepreneurship.

R&D Intensity
Despite the tendency of technological entrepreneurs to emphasize R&D and technological
excellence, our study showed a negative correlation between initial success and R&D intensity. Similarly, product uniqueness (which depends on R&D intensity) was shown not
to be a significant factor in determining initial success. Once the product has been designed
and its functional advantages demonstrated, it appears that the new venture should devote
a higher portion of its limited resources to marketing.
Finally, it must be recognized that this sample is quite small and not necessarily
representative of a broad spectrum of new technical ventures. Therefore, our results must
be viewed as preliminary and our conclusions as tentative. We plan to address such issues
in the continuation of our work.
