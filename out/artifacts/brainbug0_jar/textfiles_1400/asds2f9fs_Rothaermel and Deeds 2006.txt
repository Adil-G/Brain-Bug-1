Abstract
We investigate a high-technology venture’s alliance management capability. Thus, we develop a
model that links differential demands of alliance type and the benefits of alliance experience to an
observable outcome from a firm’s alliance management capability. We test our model on a sample of
2226 R&D alliances entered into by 325 global biotechnology firms. We find that alliance type and
alliance experience moderate the relationship between a high-technology venture’s R&D alliances
and its new product development. These results provide empirical evidence for the existence of an
alliance management capability and its heterogeneous distribution across firms.

management as a source of competitive advantage. J. Manage. 28, 413–446], we empirically
investigate the effect of alliance-specific and firm-level factors on a high-technology
venture’s alliance management capability. We define alliance management capability as a
firm’s ability to effectively manage multiple alliances.
To test the effect of alliance type on alliance management capability, we first establish that
the relationship between a high-technology venture’s R&D alliances and its new product
development is inverted U-shaped, regardless of alliance type (i.e., upstream, horizontal and
downstream alliances). Then, we posit that different alliance types place differential
demands on a firm’s alliance management capability due to the different types of partners
involved and due to the different types of knowledge being transferred. Finally, we argue that
firms build an alliance management capability through cumulative experience with strategic
alliances over time. We test the effects of alliance type and alliance experience on alliance
management capability by drawing on a sample of 2226 R&D alliances entered into by 325
global biotechnology firms in the 25-year period between 1973 and 1997.
We find that alliance type and alliance experience moderate the relationship between a
high-technology venture’s R&D alliances and its new product development. These results
provide some preliminary empirical evidence for the existence of an alliance management
capability. The results further highlight the relevance of alliance management capability
for high-technology ventures since alliance experience appears to be a distinct construct,
different from firm age and firm size. Taken together, these results underscore both the
ability of a high-tech venture to create a competitive advantage based on its alliance
management capability and the risks alliances pose if the firm’s alliance activity exceeds
its alliance management capability. Managers in high-tech ventures need to consider their
current alliance portfolio as well as potential alliances within the context of their firm’s
alliance management capability.

2. Introduction
Strategic alliances are voluntary agreements between independent firms to develop and
commercialize new products, technologies or services (Gulati, 1998). The use of strategic
alliances has grown dramatically over the last two decades, particularly in high-technology
industries (Hagedoorn, 1993). Commensurately, allying has become critical to the success
of high-tech entrepreneurial ventures (Powell et al., 1996). Recently, scholars have
proposed that firms differ systematically in their alliance management capability and that
these differences may be a source of firm-level competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh,
1998; Ireland et al., 2002). Thus, understanding how alliance-specific and firm-level
factors impact a firm’s alliance management capability is an important, yet under
researched, question, especially in the entrepreneurial context.
Prior research has provided empirical evidence that an entrepreneurial firm’s strategic
alliances enhance its rate of patenting (Shan et al., 1994), product innovation (George et al.,
2002; Kelley and Rice, 2002), speed to initial public offering (IPO) (Stuart et al., 1999),
market valuation at IPO (DeCarolis and Deeds, 1999) and foreign sales (Leiblein and Reuer,
2004). Other studies have generally endorsed a positive effect of alliances on entrepreneurial
firm performance, but cautioned that there may exist diminishing returns to extensive allying

<-----Page 2----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

431

(Deeds and Hill, 1996). Some researchers have moved beyond general alliance experience
and shown that alliance experience with the same partner over time positively impacted the
alliance performance of subsequent alliances between these two partners (Zollo et al., 2002),
and that firms with alliance experiences in similar technological fields were less likely to
engage in post-formation governance changes in a subsequent alliance (Reuer et al., 2002).2
When focusing on established firms rather than high-tech ventures, alliance experience has
also been shown to result in higher stock market value creation (Anand and Khanna,
2000), enhanced new product development (Rothaermel, 2001a) and in the establishment
of a dedicated alliance function, which in turn positively impacted alliance performance
(Kale et al., 2002).
While prior research has clearly provided some evidence for the existence of firm-level
alliance experience effects, empirical research that investigates factors impacting a firm’s
alliance management capability is scarce, mainly due to methodological obstacles. We argue
that, if an alliance management capability indeed exists, it must have tangible benefits to be the
basis for a firm-level competitive advantage (Godfrey and Hill, 1995). One such tangible
benefit of a firm’s alliance management capability is the firm’s ability to productively manage
its alliances, which in turn should positively impact its performance. Accordingly, we define
alliance management capability as a firm’s ability to effectively manage multiple alliances.
To empirically explore the construct of alliance management capability, we first
establish that the relationship between a high-technology venture’s alliances and its new
product development is inverted U-shaped. In particular, we demonstrate that an inverted
U-shaped relationship holds not only for a high-tech ventures total portfolio of alliances
but also for individual alliance types (i.e., upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances).
This is a precursory step to empirically establish that a firm’s level of alliance management
capability can be proxied by the point of diminishing total returns in the relationship
between a firm’s alliances and its new product development.
We then turn to the determinants of a firm’s alliance management capability. We
develop the notion that the alliance type and the firm’s alliance experience moderate the
relationship between firm allying and new product development. In particular, we
suggest that different types of alliances demand different amounts of a high-tech
venture’s alliance management capability. Moreover, we propose that an alliance
management capability is built through accumulated alliance experience over time. Firms
with greater alliance experience should be able to productively manage a larger number
of alliances. We test these hypotheses on a sample of 2226 R&D alliances entered into
by 325 global biotechnology firms in the 25-year period between 1973 and 1997.

3. Alliance management capability
The management of alliances is a difficult organizational activity due to the
complexities and uncertainties inherent in managing projects across organizational
boundaries. It is not surprising, therefore, that most alliances fail or do not live up to
expectations (Kogut, 1989). Yet, the ability to manage alliances effectively has been

suggested to be a firm-level dynamic capability that enables a firm to bintegrate, build and
reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environmentsQ
in order to create binnovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and
market positionsQ (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516). This is one reason why recent theoretical
work has emphasized that superior alliance management can contribute to a firm-level
competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ireland et al., 2002).
We suggest that an alliance management capability is a path dependent capability which is
built over time through repeated engagements in strategic alliances (Levitt and March, 1988).
Prior empirical work has produced some evidence that a firm’s alliance experience positively
affects its rate of patenting (Shan et al., 1994; Sampson, 2002), new product development
(Deeds and Hill, 1996) and stock-market value created (Anand and Khanna, 2000). Others
have recently focused our attention not only on alliance experience per se, but rather on how
firms leverage their experience in developing an alliance capability (Kale et al., 2002).
If the capability to manage alliances is heterogeneously distributed across firms and difficult
to imitate, a firm’s alliance management capability has the potential to create a firm-level
competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Ireland et al., 2002). We suggest that a firm-level
alliance management capability might be particularly salient for high-tech entrepreneurial
firms. Said firms often need to rely on extensive interfirm cooperation in discovering,
developing and commercializing new products (Powell et al., 1996), given the importance of
resource access for new ventures (Alvarez and Barney, 2002; Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001).
Successful new product development has been found to be especially critical for
entrepreneurial firms in high-technology industries (Schoonhoven et al., 1990).
While prior research has provided some evidence for the existence of firm-level alliance
experience effects (Anand and Khanna, 2000; Hoang and Rothaermel, 2005; Zollo et al.,
2002), research that empirically investigates factors impacting a firm’s alliance management
capability is scarce due to considerable methodological barriers. Pioneering empirical work
in the area of alliance capability has resorted to tracking changes in a firm’s organizational
structure, in particular bthe creation of a separate, dedicated organizational unit charged with
the responsibility to capture prior alliance experienceQ (Kale et al., 2002, p. 750), to proxy for
an alliance management capability. These researchers found that firms with a dedicated
alliance function achieved higher alliance performance as measured in managerial
perception and stock market responses. While the creation of a dedicated alliance function
that bcoordinates all alliance-related activity within the organization and is charged with
institutionalizing processes and systems to teach, share and leverage prior alliancemanagement experience and know-how throughout the companyQ (Dyer et al., 2001, p. 38)
appears to be a reasonable approach to leverage alliance experience for large, multidivisional firms that formed the sample in the Kale et al. (2002) study, it appears less likely to
be a viable option for entrepreneurial ventures due to their endemic resource constraints.
Yet, measuring alliance management capability more directly appears to be an almost
insurmountable task due to the inherent unobservability of capabilities. Godfrey and Hill
(1995) argued that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential
strategic management theories including the resource-based view of the firm, and by
extension, the dynamic capabilities view. Given this serious challenge impeding
empirical research, they suggested that bwhat scholars need to do is to theoretically
identify what the observable consequences of unobservable resources [capabilities] are

<-----Page 4----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

433

likely to be, and then go out and see whether such predictions have a correspondence in
the empirical world. The analogy here is with quantum mechanics, which has been
confirmed not by observing subatomic entities (since they are unobservable) but by
observing the trail left by subatomic entities in the cloud chambers of linear acceleratorsQ
(Godfrey and Hill, 1995, p. 530).
Therefore, if an alliance management capability indeed exists, it must have tangible
benefits to be the basis for a firm-level competitive advantage. When isolated properly in
an empirical analysis, these tangible benefits can then be observed. One such tangible
benefit of a firm’s alliance management capability is that it enhances the firm’s ability to
manage effectively a larger number of alliances, an observable consequence of an
unobservable alliance capability. We estimate this benefit by employing a novel measure
to assess a firm’s level of alliance management capability. In particular, we suggest that the
point of diminishing total returns in the relationship between a firm’s alliances and its new
product development is reflective of a firm’s maximum ability to manage alliances
effectively.
Capabilities are path dependent and as such are constrained by the firm’s past
investments, prior experiences and current resource endowments (Dierickx and Cool,
1989). Given that history matters, there are limitations on any firm-level capability,
including the number of alliances that a firm can manage productively. Therefore,
declining performance is likely the observable outcome when a firm’s activities exceed its
finite capabilities. This observation enables us to leverage the point of diminishing returns
in the relationship between allying and new product development as a proxy for a firm’s
alliance management capability. Accordingly, we first establish that the relationship
between a firm’s alliances and its new product development is inverted U-shaped, and that
it holds regardless of alliance type, before discussing the effects of alliance type and
alliance experience on a firm’s alliance management capability.
3.1. Alliance type and new product development
Some researchers documented a positive relationship between an entrepreneurial firm’s
strategic alliances and firm performance (Shan et al., 1994). Yet, one must consider the
fact that firms, especially new ventures, face limited managerial and financial resources.
Thus, the relationship between the number of alliances into which a firm enters and its
innovative output may eventually exhibit diminishing marginal returns and, possibly
diminishing total returns beyond some point. In this vein, others demonstrated that there
exist negative returns to high levels of alliance activity for high-technology ventures
(Deeds and Hill, 1996).
There are several reasons for an inverted U-shaped relationship. In a classical Ricardian
sense, the most productive alliances are entered first, leaving only less productive alliances
for subsequent alliance formation. As the number of simultaneously managed alliances
increases, managers are likely to be prone to information-processing overload, a problem
that has been identified in a variety of managerial tasks (Hitt et al., 1997; Zahra et al.,
2000). As firms enter more alliances, their transaction costs rise, possibly beyond a point
where the gains from additional alliances are outweighed by their costs (Jones and Hill,
1988), resulting in a negative net effect for high levels of alliance activity.

<-----Page 5----->434

While demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that there exists declining
marginal and possibly declining total returns to the number of alliances a firm manages
simultaneously, prior work has failed to generalize this relationship to different types of
alliances. To investigate the relationship between alliance type and alliance management
capability, we first need to establish that an inverted U-shaped relationship holds for
different alliance types. Generalizing to different types of alliances is important since
entrepreneurial firms tend to engage in alliances with different partners along the
industry value chain (upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances), often reflective of
the different types of knowledge being transferred in the alliances. This generalization
lays the foundation for exploring the impact of alliance type on alliance management
capability.
An entrepreneurial venture using R&D alliances within the new product development
process has three distinct choices of partners differentiated by their position along the
industry value chain (Baum et al., 2000). The firm can reach upstream in the product
development process to tap into the basic, early stage research upon which a research
project is based (upstream alliances). It can reach horizontally to other technology
ventures to combine resources and technologies, which have reached the early stages of
commercialization (horizontal alliances). The venture can also reach downstream to
access the manufacturing, regulatory and marketing knowledge that is required to move
from a commercially feasible technology to a marketable product (downstream alliances).
Based on the arguments advanced above, we suggest that the total number of a hightechnology venture’s alliances and the number of the venture’s alliances in each different
alliance type are related to its new product development in a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped
manner.
Hypothesis 1. The relationship between a high-technology venture’s total number of
alliances and its new product development is inverted U-shaped (H1). An inverted Ushaped relationship holds regardless of alliance type, i.e., for upstream (H1a), horizontal
(H1b) and downstream (H1c) alliances.
3.2. Alliance type and alliance management capability
Firms generally face the challenge of managing different types of alliances that are
likely to make differential demands on the firm’s alliance management capability. Such
differential demands on a firm’s alliance management capability stem primarily from two
factors: the different types of partners involved in the firm’s alliances and the different
types of knowledge being transferred through the alliances. We first discuss a
biotechnology firm’s different alliance partners along the industry value chain before
discussing the implications of the different types of knowledge being transferred in these
alliances.
3.2.1. Different types of partners
When studying different types of partners involved in R&D alliances, Lane and
Lubatkin (1998) found that the ability of a pharmaceutical firm to learn from an alliance
with a biotechnology firm was determined by the relative characteristics of the two

<-----Page 6----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

435

partners involved in the alliance. In particular, the ability of the pharma firm to learn from
the biotech firm depended on the similarity of both firms’ dominant logics, knowledge
bases, as well as their organizational structures and compensation policies. The greater the
similarities in these areas, the more effective the knowledge transfer, even if the
knowledge was more tacit in nature.
A biotechnology venture generally faces three different types of partners along the
industry value chain (Baum et al., 2000). Upstream alliances are entered with research
universities or other non-profit research institutions, horizontal alliances are partnerships
with other biotechnology firms, and downstream alliances are generally entered into with
established pharmaceutical companies. These three different types of partners differ
substantially along the dimensions identified by Lane and Lubatkin (1998). For example,
most research universities are large public institutions dominated by bureaucratic
structures, whose primary obligation is the creation and dissemination of knowledge.
Private research universities tend to follow the same philosophy. Biotechnology firms are
generally entrepreneurial start-ups and often face resource constraints. Moreover, while the
biotech’s focus is primarily on R&D, the fact that they are for-profit entities often results in
proprietary treatment of the knowledge created and allows for substantially different
compensation plans compared to universities, most notably stock options. Finally,
pharmaceutical companies are large, established firms, with significant resources and
clearly structured processes and procedures for their organizational activities.
Extending Lane and Lubatkin’s (1998) findings to the three different types of partners a
biotechnology firm faces would suggest that alliances with universities and other research
institutions would require the greatest amount of a biotechnology firm’s alliance
management capability since the difference between non-profit and for-profit institutions
tend to be more fundamental than differences among various types of for-profit
institutions. While research universities are increasing their commercial involvement
(Thursby and Thursby, 2002), they often appear ill-prepared to transact with commercial
entities (Bowie, 1994; DiGregorio and Shane, 2003).
It appears that alliances with other biotechnology firms would require the least amount
of a biotech’s alliance management capability since two biotechs are most likely to be
more similar than biotech–university or biotech–pharma pairings along the dimensions
highlighted by Lane and Lubatkin (1998). Yet, we suggest that a biotech’s alliances with a
pharmaceutical company may actually require less of a biotech’s alliance management
capability since many, if not most, large pharmaceutical companies have institutionalized
processes and devote considerable resources to facilitate alliances with biotechnology
partners, often centralized in a dedicated alliance function (Dyer et al., 2001).
Pharmaceutical companies generally expend significant resources to manage their
alliances with biotechnology firms since these alliances are critical to adapt to the radical
innovation introduced by this new technology (Hill and Rothaermel, 2003). In turn, this
should require commensurably less of their biotechnology partner’s alliance management
capability.
For example, the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has a clearly established alliance
management process executed through their Office of Alliance Management (Gueth et al.,
2001). Lilly’s alliance management prescribes that each alliance is managed by a threeperson team: alliance champion, alliance leader and alliance manager. The alliance

<-----Page 7----->436

F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

champion is a senior executive responsible for high-level support and oversight. The
alliance leader has the technical expertise and knowledge needed for the specific area and
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the alliance. The alliance manager,
positioned within the Office of Alliance Management, serves as an alliance process
resource and business integrator between the two alliance partners, and provides alliance
training and development, as well as diagnostic tools, etc.
Clearly, different types of alliance partners demand different amounts of a
biotechnology firm’s alliance management capability. We suggest that alliances with
the pharmaceutical companies demand the least amount, while alliances with universities
demand the largest amount, and that alliances with other biotechnology firms demand a
moderate amount. Taken together, we argue that there exists a pecking order of demand
on a high-tech venture’s alliance management capability based on the type of partner,
with upstream partners demanding the most, while downstream partners demanding the
least.
3.2.2. Different types of knowledge
We suggest that the pecking order of demand on a high-tech venture’s alliance
management capability based on the type of partner corresponds to the differences in
the alliance capability required to manage the different types of knowledge that are
being transferred in different alliances along the industry value chain. Biotechnology
ventures are positioned as intermediaries in the industry value chain, taking on a dual
role of knowledge transformation and commercialization (Rothaermel and Deeds,
2004). First, biotechnology firms transform the basic scientific knowledge discovered
by universities and non-profits research institutions into viable products. The
dependence of biotechnology firms on basic science is evidenced by the high number
of citations to scientific journals included in their patents (McMillan et al., 2000).
Second, biotechnology firms then commercialize new products, generally in conjunction with established pharmaceutical companies, which manage the new products
through the regulatory process and distribute them through their dedicated sales
divisions.
The resource-based perspective has emphasized that tacitness, ambiguity and
complexity are barriers to competitive imitation because they impede organizational
learning (Barney, 1991; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). It has also been shown that these
same knowledge characteristics influence the difficulty of knowledge transfer between
parent and subsidiary (Szulanski, 1996), as well as knowledge transfer in strategic
alliances (Simonin, 1999). R&D alliances are complex organizational forms involving the
transfer of knowledge between firms under an incomplete contract. This fact implies that it
is costly to acquire and assimilate the knowledge and information needed to manage
possible contingencies (Jensen and Meckling, 1992). These knowledge acquisition costs
increase commensurately with the level of tacitness, ambiguity and complexity inherent in
alliances.
We follow Reed and DeFillippi’s (1990) definition of tacitness as the non-codifiable
accumulation of skills and know-how that results from learning-by-doing. Causal
ambiguity is the ambiguity about the nature of the causal connections between actions
and results (Lippman and Rumelt, 1982). In this case, we are concerned about knowledge

<-----Page 8----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

437

ambiguity, which we adapt from Simonin (1999), and define as a lack of understanding
about the logical links between the knowledge and the desired outcome of a commercially
viable product. Complexity refers to the number of interdependent routines, individuals,
technologies, skill sets and resources linked to a particular knowledge asset (Reed and
DeFillippi, 1990). More complex knowledge assets are more difficult to transfer and thus
require more of a firm’s alliance management capability.
Taken together, the demands of an alliance on a firm’s alliance management capability
are likely to increase commensurately with the levels of tacitness, ambiguity and
complexity involved in the knowledge exchanged in the alliance. The level of tacitness,
ambiguity and complexity of any alliance, in turn, depends on the knowledge and
activities being shared across boundaries in the alliance during different stages of the new
product development process.
Upstream alliances with universities and other research institutions are generally
characterized by high uncertainty and frequently involve the transfer of tacit, ambiguous
and complex knowledge of uncertain value. The goal of upstream alliances is to embody
leading-edge scientific discoveries into the biotechnology firm’s products or processes
(George et al., 2002). The knowledge at the center of these alliances is generally new, with
the partners having little or no experience with advancing this type of basic knowledge
into a viable prototype product or new process. The high level of knowledge ambiguity
surrounding basic scientific research places commensurately high demands on a firm’s
alliance management capability. The value and potential of the knowledge involved in
these alliances is evolving, and thus requires continuous monitoring and re-evaluation. The
actual form of the product or application to a specific disease is rather unclear in early
stage product creation. This leaves biotechnology ventures engaged in alliances with a
university partner, whose basic values and priorities are distinctively different and
potentially in direct conflict with the biotechnology venture’s need for secrecy and
protection of intellectual property (McMillan et al., 2000). Yet, to overcome the challenges
of early product development due to the tacitness, ambiguity and complexity involved in
the knowledge of interest, the alliance partners frequently place research personnel into
each other’s laboratory. Given these circumstances, upstream research alliances pose a
significant demand on a biotechnology firm’s alliance management capability since
biotechnology firms success depends on commercializing the ambiguous, uncertain, tacit
knowledge transmitted through alliances with research universities and other non-profit
research organizations.
Horizontal alliances in the R&D process are formed with other biotech firms in a
similar position in the industry value chain and are generally motivated by the desire to
combine complementary technologies or to create economies of scale. In contrast to
upstream alliances, the knowledge assets being combined in horizontal alliances are
generally closer to commercialization and therefore better understood. In addition, the
partners in a horizontal alliance generally have experience with the knowledge involved in
the alliances. The application may be new, but the knowledge bases being combined are
more familiar. The increased level of development implies that the transfer of assets in
horizontal alliances involves relatively lower levels of tacitness, ambiguity and complexity
than does the transfer of assets in upstream alliances. Thus, horizontal alliances tend to be
less demanding of the firm’s alliance management capability compared to upstream

<-----Page 9----->438

F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

alliances. Biotechnology firms both receive and transmit knowledge in horizontal
alliances.
Downstream alliances are generally formed with pharmaceutical firms that provide
manufacturing capabilities, regulatory know-how, market knowledge and access.
Downstream alliances focus on complementarities among the allied partners as they
exchange knowledge that tends to be more explicit, and thus codifiable (Teece, 1992).
Generally, the biotechnology firms transmit knowledge to the pharma companies as the
biotechs focus on drug discovery and development, while the pharmaceutical firms
leverage their expertise in clinical trials, regulatory management, and drug distribution
(Rothaermel, 2001a). Prior research has shown that most alliances between small
biotechnology firms and large pharmaceutical companies were initiated when the new
drug candidate was ready to enter clinical trials (Pisano and Mang, 1993). A new drug that
has moved through pre-clinical testing has undergone substantial development indicating
that the levels of tacitness, ambiguity and complexity in the alliance should be reduced in
downstream alliances. This in turn implies that downstream alliances should absorb less of
a firm’s alliance management capability than either horizontal or upstream alliances.
Hypothesis 2. Different alliance types demand different levels of a high-technology
venture’s alliance management capability, with upstream alliances demanding the largest
amount, downstream alliances demanding the least amount and horizontal alliances
demanding a moderate amount.
3.3. Alliance experience and alliance management capability
Building on the experience curve literature (Levitt and March, 1988), we suggest that a
firm’s alliance management capability is built through repeated engagements in alliances
over time. Traditionally, experience effects, due to their roots in operations research,
referred to systematic unit-cost reductions that occur over accumulated production volume
(Yelle, 1979). Most experience benefits appear to be based on learning-by-doing through
repeated engagements in the focal activity (Lieberman, 1984). While the majority of
empirical studies have documented learning-by-doing effects in the manufacturing sector
(Dutton and Thomas, 1984), there is also evidence that learning effects appear to play an
important role in service industries (Darr et al., 1995). Luft et al. (1979), for example,
found that more experienced health care providers of complex procedures like heart
surgeries performed significantly better in terms of a lower mortality rate than less
experienced providers.
Repeated engagements in strategic alliances allow the firm to create codified routines,
policies and procedures as well as tacit knowledge with respect to the entire range of
alliance management, beginning with partner selection and alliance formation to alliance
management and finally alliance termination. High-technology start-ups with greater
alliance experience tended to be more innovative (Shan et al., 1994). Learning effects have
also been found to play out in repeated joint venturing since the stock market responded
more positively to alliance announcements by firms with prior alliance experience,
especially if the joint venture contained an R&D component (Anand and Khanna, 2000).
While most empirical research on alliance experience has focused on this more general

<-----Page 10----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

439

kind of alliance experience, others have also found significant learning-by-doing
effects for repeated partnering with the same partner over time. Zollo et al. (2002)
showed that prior partner-specific experience increased the performance of subsequent
alliances with the same partner, in particular, if these alliances were organized in a
contractual fashion.
Repeated alliance engagements over time appear to contribute to the build-up of an
alliance management capability, which the firm can then leverage to enhance the
performance in subsequent alliances (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ireland et al., 2002). While
we argue that a firm-level alliance management capability is built through repeated
engagements in alliances, this does not imply that entrepreneurial start-ups are unable to
accumulate alliance experience in any meaningful fashion. The definition of alliance
management capability as a firm’s ability to effectively manage multiple alliances implies
that entrepreneurial ventures may accrue alliance experience through entering several
alliances early on, in a more or less simultaneous fashion.3 Taken together, we suggest that
a firm’s cumulative alliance experience moderates the relationship between firm allying
and performance. All else being equal, a firm with greater alliance experience should be
able to manage a larger number of alliances effectively.
Hypothesis 3. A high-technology venture’s alliance experience moderates the relationship
between strategic alliances and new product development in such a fashion that a more
experienced firm is able to manage a larger number of alliances.

4. Methods
4.1. Data and sample
To test the hypotheses relating different alliance types to new product development and
the effect of alliance type and alliance experience on alliance management capability, we
chose the global biotechnology industry as the research setting. The scientific breakthroughs underlying biotechnology, such as genetic engineering and hybridoma
technology, were accomplished in the mid-1970s. Subsequently, the first new biotechnology drugs reached the market for pharmaceuticals in the 1980s. This industry seems
particularly suitable to test the notion of an alliance management capability since it
exhibits the highest number of alliances among all high-technology industries (Hagedoorn,
1993). In the biotechnology industry, collaborative arrangements appear to be critical to
firm performance since upwards of 70% of the top-10 selling drugs during the study
period were commercialized through biotech–pharma collaborations (Ernst and Young
Biotechnology Reports). This number, reflecting the collaborative intensity in this
industry, would even be higher if one were to add the biotechnology firms’ alliances with

The empirical results presented below show that alliance experience is not significantly correlated with firm
age (r = 0.03), and thus underscores the relevancy of alliance management capability as an entrepreneurial
phenomenon.

universities that laid the foundation for many of these projects (Rothaermel and Deeds,
2004). Moreover, the biotechnology industry is characterized by a prolonged period of
entrepreneurial activity due the drawn out product development process for new drugs (up
to 15 years or more), and the complex, uncertain and costly nature of transforming basic
science into commercializable drugs (upwards of US$500 million). Thus, the vast majority
of biotechnology firms in the sample (95%) had no approved drugs on the market at the
end of the study period (1997) and was burning substantial amounts of cash to finance
ongoing R&D activities.
Biotechnology firms are clearly engaged in the process of entrepreneurship–the
creation of new wealth through opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation (Shane
and Venkataraman, 2000)–and this process extends to a considerable period of time. The
prolonged time frame for new product development provides a window of opportunity for
the examination of the entrepreneurial process and the emergence of a new industry. These
characteristics make the biotechnology industry an excellent candidate for the study of
entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity. While none of the prior empirical research
has focused on the determinants of an alliance management capability in high-technology
ventures, the substantial prior work situated in the biotechnology industry has investigated
various aspects of other entrepreneurial phenomena (Deeds and Hill, 1996; George et al.,
2002; Powell et al., 1996; Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004; Sørensen and Stuart, 2000; Stuart
and Sorenson, 2003; Stuart et al., 1999).
To create the sample, we identified all biotechnology firms listed in the 1997 BioScan
industry directory that were fully dedicated to human therapeutics. These are hightechnology ventures that were founded to commercialize the new biotechnology. BioScan
is a publicly available industry directory that provides comprehensive data about the
worldwide biotechnology industry. The data contained in BioScan are cumulative in the
sense that each subsequent issue includes the information of all prior versions. The sources
for the BioScan data are company questionnaires, news releases, annual reports, SEC and
FDA filings, journals and investment reports, among others. BioScan data are factual and
objective in nature; it does not include any comparative or evaluative analyses. For
example, BioScan lists qualitative information about each firm such as its new product
development, number of employees, year of founding, whether the firm is public or
private, whether the firm is a subsidiary or independent, etc. Moreover, BioScan provides
detailed information about each firm’s alliances, such as the focal firm’s partners, the
month and year when the alliance was entered, and whether the alliance is governed by an
equity or contractual arrangement. An additional source of data for this study was the
patent database maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
The biotechnology firms in this sample are engaged in the discovery, development and
commercialization of therapeutics that are placed inside the human body (in vivo).
Focusing on the in-vivo segment of biotechnology ensures a homogenous sample since
firms engaged in this industry segment are exposed to extensive regulatory requirements
(e.g., Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in the U.S. or European Medicines Evaluation
Agency [EMEA]), which bring with them detailed reporting of products under
development. Moreover, this industry demarcation reflects the uniqueness of the
biotechnology segment in terms of its economic importance and potential, its regulatory
environment and its consumer market (Powell et al., 1996).

<-----Page 12----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

441

We obtained a sample of 325 fully dedicated biotechnology firms that participated in
2226 R&D alliances between 1973 and 1997. We collected data on alliance activity since
the inception of commercial biotechnology, and thus were able to attenuate the problem of
left-censoring that is frequently observed in prior alliance studies.
4.2. Variables and measures
4.2.1. New product development
A biotechnology firm’s new product development is the dependent variable of this
study. We measured a biotechnology firm’s new product development by its total
number of new biotechnology products, which is the sum of products in development
and products on the market, as of the end of the study period (1997). Using the number
of products on the market as sole indicator for new product development was not
feasible since the majority of the entrepreneurial firms in this study did not have any
products on the market due to the protracted nature of the new product development and
approval process in biopharmaceuticals. Moreover, it is important to emphasize that the
drug product development process is beset with extreme uncertainty as more than 99%
of all molecules screened do not make it into clinical trials (Ernst and Young
Biotechnology Reports). We only count drugs that have entered clinical trials as being
products in development. These products have overcome a major hurdle towards
successful commercialization in the product development process. Focusing on products
in development allows us to investigate the relationship between a biotechnology firm’s
alliances and its new product development (Hypothesis 1), which lays the foundation for
testing the moderating effects of alliance type (Hypothesis 2) and alliance experience
(Hypothesis 3) on alliance management capability. Thus, we submit that the sum of
products in development and products on the market presents a reasonably proxy for a
biotechnology firm’s total new product development.
4.2.2. Alliance type
We proxied a biotechnology firm’s alliances by the total number of its R&D alliances
that the firm had entered into with any other partner along the industry value chain (total
alliances). We then split the total number of alliances into three subcategories: upstream,
horizontal and downstream alliances. We proxied a biotechnology firm’s upstream
alliances through alliances with non-profit organizations such as universities and other
research institutions, horizontal alliances through alliances with other biotechnology firms
and downstream alliances through alliances with pharmaceutical firms (Baum et al.,
2000). While the type of partner is accurately reflected by this categorization, the type of
knowledge transferred in these alliances represents a more rough, yet reasonable,
approximation.
4.2.3. Alliance management capability
A firm’s ability to manage its alliances has been highlighted as a dynamic capability,
and thus should contribute to achieving a competitive advantage (Teece et al., 1997)
through allowing the firm to manage a larger number of alliances productively. Yet, if a
capability enables a firm to enhance its performance, what is the observable consequence

<-----Page 13----->442

F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

if the firm exceeds its capability? Clearly, declining performance should result. We submit
that the point of diminishing total returns (or inflection point) in the relationship between a
critical firm activity and firm performance indicates the maximum level of the specific
capability held by the firm at a certain point in time.
Therefore, we suggest that one way to assess a firm’s alliance management capability is
by the number of alliances a firm is able to manage productively in a simultaneous fashion.
Specifically, this capability is examined by assessing the point at which the addition of the
next alliance at the margin is detrimental to firm performance since the hypothesized
relationship between a firm’s capability and firm performance is positive up to the point at
which a firm exceeds that capability by taking on one too many projects, alliances, etc.
Hence, the inflection point represents the maximum level of this capability and thus is the
observable consequence of an unobservable capability (Godfrey and Hill, 1995).
Accordingly, we proxied a firm’s alliance management capability by the point of
diminishing total returns in the functional relationship between a firm’s number of
alliances and firm performance, which herein is measured as new product development.
The point of diminishing total returns represents the point at which a firm’s next alliance
has a negative impact on the firm’s overall new product development, i.e., the total returns
to allying are beginning to decline. This point is an observable consequence of a firm
exceeding its capability to manage its alliances effectively.
It is very important to note that our proxy for alliance management capability is not
concerned with the relative height of the functional relationship between a firm’s alliances
and its new product development across different alliance types, which depends on the
differential contribution of the specific alliance type. When considering the performance
implications of individual alliance types, one would clearly expect downstream alliances to
have the strongest effect on new product development, while upstream alliances would have
the weakest effect and horizontal alliances would have a moderate effect. This would be
expected because of the differential theoretical proximity in the relationships between the
different alliance types and new product development. In this study of alliance management
capability, however, the critical point in the relationship between a firm’s alliances and its
new product development is to be found on the horizontal axis (representing the number of
alliances) at which the relationship turns negative rather than on the vertical axis
(representing new product development). Mathematically, this is the point where the slope
of the function relating alliances to new product development is zero. The specific inflection
point is an indication of the magnitude of a firm’s alliance management capability beyond
which it can no longer manage subsequent alliances productively. All else being equal, the
later a firm reaches its inflection point, the more alliances it can manage simultaneously, and
thus the greater its alliance management capability.
Based on the arguments presented above, we expect the respective point of diminishing
returns to vary systematically across different alliance types due to differential demands on
a firm’s alliance management capability (Hypothesis 2). We suggested that upstream
alliances generally place the greatest demands on a biotechnology firm’s alliance
management capability and should thus reach their point of diminishing total returns
first, while downstream alliances require the least amount of a biotechnology firm’s
alliance management capability and should thus reach their point of diminishing returns
last. The point of diminishing total returns for horizontal alliances, due to their moderate

<-----Page 14----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

443

amount of alliance management capability required, should fall in between that of
upstream and downstream alliances.
4.2.4. Alliance experience
We proxied a biotechnology firm’s alliance experience by its alliance years, which is
the cumulative sum of the alliance duration for each of the firm’s alliances. For example, if
a firm has formed three alliances over the study period, with the first alliance 3 years old,
the second 6 years old and the third 8 years old, the firm’s total cumulative alliance
experience would be 17 years. This experience measure corresponds to the experience
construct underlying the experience curve effect (Dutton and Thomas, 1984) since a firmlevel alliance experience, such as forming, managing and exiting alliances, is accumulated
through learning-by-doing over time (Levitt and March, 1988). This assumption also
resonates with prior empirical research demonstrating a life cycle to individual alliances
(Deeds and Hill, 1999; Deeds and Rothaermel, 2003).
Moreover, the alliance experience measure used in this study goes beyond that of
simple alliance counts generally used in prior research (Anand and Khanna, 2000;
Deeds and Hill, 1996; Hoang and Rothaermel, 2005; Kale et al., 2002; Rothaermel,
2001a; Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004; Sampson, 2002; Shan et al., 1994; Zollo et al.,
2002). We are able to differentiate, for example, between five alliances that were entered
1 year ago and five alliances that were entered 4 years ago. Applying the traditional
measure of raw alliance counts as a proxy for alliance experience, this example would
have been coded indiscriminately as an experience of five alliances for both
observations. On the other hand, applying our more fine grained measure of alliance
years as a proxy for alliance experience, the first observation would have been coded as
an experience of 5 alliance years and the second observation as one of 20 alliance years.
We submit that an alliance experience measure of alliance counts weighted by alliance
time enables us to conduct a more subtle analysis of an alliance experience effect on
alliance management capability.
To test the moderating effect of firm alliance experience on the relationship between
firm allying and new product development (Hypothesis 3), we split the sample along the
mean of alliance experience.4 This approach is indicated to test the moderating impact of
alliance experience on the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between allying and new
product development. In particular, this allows us to investigate if a significant difference
in the respective points of diminishing total returns exists. We suggest that a difference in
the respective inflection points to allying is reflective of a differential firm-level alliance
management capability resulting from different levels of alliance experience.
Two requirements must be fulfilled when using a split sample approach to test for
moderation (Green, 1978). First, the two sub-samples must be significantly different along
the variables of interest. Second, the variances of the key variables in the two sub-samples
4
Prior to splitting the sample, we established a positive and significant impact of alliance experience on new
product development ( p b 0.05). Moreover, adding the alliance experience variable resulted in a significant better
model fit (Dv 2 = 8.51, df = 1, p b 0.01). These results enhanced our confidence in applying a split sample approach
to test Hypothesis 3. A recent example of a split sample approach is found in Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995) when
studying product innovation in the computer industry.

<-----Page 15----->444

F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

must be equal (i.e., not significantly different). We tested these requirements for the alliance
experience variable since this was the decision criterion used to split the sample, and for the
new product development variable since this is the dependent variable of the study.
Applying a t-test, we find that the two sub-samples are significantly different with respect to
their alliance experience and new product development (in both cases at p b 0.001).
Moreover, applying a variance ratio test revealed that the variances for the two sub-samples
are not significantly different along alliance experience or new product development.
4.3. Control variables
To isolate the effect of a high-technology venture’s alliances on its new product
development, we controlled for a number of possible confounding effects including a
firm’s size, age, innovativeness and technological diversity. We further controlled whether
the firm was public, a subsidiary or a U.S. firm. We also included the governance structure
and the age of the alliances as control variables.
Firm size is a critical control variable when attempting to isolate the moderating
effect of alliance experience on the relationship between allying and new product
development. We controlled for firm size by using the number of employees as a proxy.
Using the number of employees as a proxy for firm size is the preferred measure in this
industry since many biotechnology firms do not yet have positive revenues that would
allow the use of more traditional size measures like market share. Moreover, the assets
of dedicated biotechnology firms are largely intangible, which rules out total assets as a
proxy for firm size.
Firm age is a second critical control variable in isolating the moderating impact of
alliance experience on the relationship between firm allying and new product
development. We measured a biotechnology firm’s age by its age since founding. All
new biotechnology firms in this sample are fully dedicated biotechnology firms, thus
calculating their age since incorporation is appropriate (Sørensen and Stuart, 2000).
We controlled for a biotech firm’s innovativeness by including a count variable of its
patents received between 1991 and 1995. In the biotechnology industry, patent counts as a
proxy for innovativeness may be preferred over patent citation measures since citations
occur over time and thus are biased towards older patents. This bias would be potentially
accentuated in this high-technology sample since most biotechnology firms are recent
start-ups that did not have an opportunity to accrue many patent citations (DeCarolis and
Deeds, 1999). Prior research has shown that a firm’s raw patent count is highly correlated
with the quality of its patents (Stuart, 2000). We applied a 5-year window to attenuate
annual fluctuations. This enabled us to capture a firm’s innovativeness more effectively
since most firms in the sample do not receive many patents per year, if any. Such a time
window is consistent with prior research proxying a firm’s innovativeness (Stuart and
Podolny, 1996; Ahuja, 2000).5
We further controlled for the ownership status of the firm (1 = public firm) and whether
the firm was a subsidiary or independent (1 = subsidiary). We also included an indicator
variable (1 = U.S. firm) to capture institutional and cultural differences. Moreover,
5

The results presented below remained robust to variations in the time window.

<-----Page 16----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

445

biotechnology is characterized by many different technology trajectories. To control for
each firm’s degree of technological diversity, we included a count variable representing the
number of distinct biotechnology subfields in which the firm participated.
Strategic alliances are ongoing cooperative relationships between independent firms
that are governed either by contractual agreements or by equity. Non-equity alliances are
much more frequent, although equity alliances are considered to be stronger ties. We
included a ratio of a firm’s equity alliances over its total alliances to control for a firm’s
preference for equity versus non-equity alliances and its potential impact on new product
development. Finally, we controlled for the average age of a firm’s alliances (in months)
since older alliances are more likely to yield new product development than younger
alliances.
4.4. Model specification
We standardized the variables to reduce potential multicollinearity and to enhance the
interpretability of the results. Following Aiken and West (1991), we standardized the
variables contained in the interaction terms prior to creating the cross products.
Standardization improves the robustness of the analysis without degrading the quality
of the data. Further, we explicitly assessed potential multicollinearity in all models, and
found that the variance inflation factors were well below the suggested cut-off point of 10
(Kleinbaum et al., 1988).
The dependent variable, number of new products, is a count variable taking on discrete
non-negative integer values, including zero. We applied the following specification of a
Poisson regression model to test our hypotheses (Greene, 1997):
E NPDi =Xi Þ ¼ ebXi ;
where NPDi is the number of new products by firm i and X i is a vector of regressors
containing the independent and control variables described above. To obtain consistent
and robust standard errors that are corrected for over dispersion, we employed a general
linear model (GLM) estimation technique (Gourieroux et al., 1984).6

5. Results
Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations and bivariate correlations. The average
biotechnology firm in this sample has a total of 6 new products, holds 5 patents, has 162
employees, competes in 6 different biotechnology subfields and is 10 years old. Moreover,
69% of the firms are public, 8% are subsidiaries and 78% are U.S. firms. The average firm
has entered about 7 alliances, of which 4% are structured as equity alliances. It is
important to note that, while the average firm is only 10 years old, it has accumulated 22
years of alliance experience. Noteworthy is also the discriminant validity of the measures.

We also checked the robustness of our findings presented below by additionally applying a negative binomial
regression model. The results were consistent.

The correlations between alliance experience and firm age (r = 0.03) or firm size (r = 0.17)
are well below the suggested cut-off point of r = 0.70 (Cohen et al., 2003). This is pertinent
since it emphasizes alliance experience as a distinct construct relevant for entrepreneurial
ventures.
The entrepreneurial profile of this sample is further highlighted by focusing on the
following descriptive statistics. The median age of the biotech firms in this sample is 9
years, while the median firm size is 60 employees. Applying traditional categorizations for
entrepreneurial firms, we find the following: Out of the 325 biotech firms in the sample,
209 (64%) are 10 years old or younger, while 232 (71%) firms have no more than 100
employees. Yet, new ventures in the life sciences tend to be older than entrepreneurial
ventures in other industries due the protracted nature of the new product development
process. As a case in point, 308 biotech firms (95%) in the sample did not have a single
drug on the market. The important point in considering the entrepreneurial nature of the
firms in this sample is that all of them were directly involved in the process of
entrepreneurship defined as recognizing, evaluating and exploiting opportunities to create
new wealth (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). Thus, while a few firms in the sample might
not fit the typical profile of an entrepreneurial firm when applying a simple age
classification, all of the firms in the sample are engaged in the entrepreneurial process. In
sum, we submit that the sample can reasonably be viewed as entrepreneurial high-tech in
nature.
The 325 biotechnology firms entered a total of 2226 R&D alliances. These alliances
split into 524 (23%) upstream alliances, 729 (33%) horizontal alliances and 973 (44%)
downstream alliances. At the industry level, the biotechnology firms engaged in
downstream alliances at a significantly greater rate than horizontal alliances and, in turn,
used horizontal alliances at a significantly greater frequency than upstream alliances (all
differences at p b 0.001). Accordingly, this distinction also holds true at the firm level. The
average biotechnology firm uses downstream alliances (2.99) at a significant greater
frequency than horizontal alliances (2.24) and horizontal alliances at a significant greater
frequency than upstream alliances (1.61, again all differences at p b 0.001).
Table 2 depicts the descriptive statistics for the low and high alliance experience subsamples. As anticipated, the firms in the two sub-samples differ significantly along several
dimensions including new product development and alliance experience. Yet, we also find
that there are many younger firms among the high-experience sub-sample (about one half
of the firms are 10 years or younger), which indicates that accumulated alliance experience
appears to be quite relevant for entrepreneurial start-ups.
Table 3 presents the regression results for testing Hypotheses 1 and 2. Model 1 is the
baseline model and includes the control variables only. Each subsequent model provides a
significant improvement over the baseline model. Model 2 evaluates the impact of a hightechnology ventures total number of alliances. Models 3–5 assess the effect of the
individual alliance type on a high-technology venture’s new product development in
isolation, while model 6 represents the fully specified model assessing the effect of each
individual alliance type on new product development while controlling for alternate
alliance types and other potentially confounding factors.
Hypothesis 1 states that the relationship between a high-technology venture’s total
number of alliances and its new product development is inverted U-shaped, and that this

relationship holds regardless of alliance type, i.e., for upstream (Hypothesis 1a),
horizontal (Hypothesis 1b) and downstream alliances (Hypothesis 1c). The results
obtained in model 2 support Hypothesis 1, while models 3–5 each provide individual
support for Hypothesis 1a–c since the linear term of the respective alliance type is
positive and significant in each case, while the squared term of the respective alliance
type is negative and significant in each case (albeit at p b 0.10 for upstream alliances).
The results for the individual alliance types remain robust in model 6, when assessing
the effect of each alliance type on new product development, while controlling for the
other alliance types (the squared term for downstream alliances is significant at p b 0.10,
however). Overall, the findings provide broad support for Hypothesis 1 (H1 and H1a–c)
suggesting that the relationship between alliances and new product development is
inverted U-shaped, regardless of alliance type.
Hypothesis 2 predicts that different alliance types demand different levels of a hightechnology venture’s alliance management capability, with upstream alliances demanding
the largest amount, downstream alliances demanding the least amount, and horizontal
alliances demanding a moderate amount. To test this hypothesis, we determined the
respective point of diminishing total returns for each alliance type on a firm’s new product
development. As a reflection of differential demands on a venture’s alliance management
capability, upstream alliances should reach their respective point of diminishing returns
first, followed by horizontal alliances, which in turn should be followed by downstream
alliances. To calculate the respective inflection points, we took the partial derivatives with
respect to each alliance type (in model 6). We find the inflection point increases from 2.36
for upstream alliances to 3.65 for horizontal alliances and finally to 6.01 for downstream
alliances. All else being equal, a high-technology firm’s alliance management capability
increases by a total of more than 150% when comparing a firm’s inflection point for its
upstream versus its downstream alliances.
Additionally, we applied a Wald-type test to the fully specified model (model 6) to test
whether the respective differences in inflection points are significantly different. We find

that a high-technology firm in this sample can manage more downstream alliances than
horizontal alliances ( p b 0.001), and in turn more horizontal alliances than upstream
alliances ( p b 0.001). This implies that different alliance types demand different amounts
of a firm’s alliance management capability, and thus provides support for Hypothesis 2.
Fig. 1, which is based on the coefficients in model 6, depicts the effect of alliance type on
the relationship between allying and new product development. Corresponding to
Hypothesis 2, the figure reveals that upstream alliances reach their inflection point first,
followed by horizontal alliances, and finally by downstream alliances. This implies that
upstream alliances require the largest amount of high-technology venture’s alliance
management capability, downstream alliances demand the least amount and horizontal
alliances a moderate amount.
We also find the inflection point for the total number of alliances is 3.90 (model 2),
which is, as excepted, above the inflection point for upstream alliances ( p b 0.001), but
below that of the downstream alliances ( p b 0.001). This result can be interpreted as
additional evidence that different alliance types demand different amounts of a firm’s
alliance management capability since the total number of alliances considers all alliances
in a firm’s portfolio together.
Hypothesis 3 postulates that a firm’s alliance experience moderates the relationship
between strategic alliances and new product development in such a fashion that a more
experienced firm is able to manage a larger number of alliances. We split the sample in
two sub-samples using the mean of alliance experience as decision criterion. Table 4

contains the baseline model for the low alliance experience sub-sample, while model 9 is
the baseline for the high alliance experience sub-sample.
Models 8 and 10 are the respective full specifications for each sub-sample, and
each provides a significant improvement over their respective baseline model
( p b 0.001 in each case). In both models, we find that the relationship between
allying and new product development takes on an inverted U-shape since the linear
alliance terms are each positive and significant, while the squared alliance terms are
each negative and significant. Testing whether alliance experience moderates the
relationship between allying and new product development requires a comparison of
the respective inflection points. When taking the partial derivative with respect to
alliances in models 8 and 10, we find that the inflection point for the low
experience sub-sample is 1.21, while it is 2.33 for the high experience sub-sample
(an increase of 93%, all else being equal). Applying a Wald-type test reveals that
firms in the high alliance experience sub-sample can manage significantly more
alliances than firms in the low experience sub-sample ( p b 0.001). This provides
support for Hypothesis 3 suggesting that a firm’s alliance experience positively
moderates the relationship between firm allying and new product development. This
relationship is reflected in Fig. 2, which is based on the coefficients in models 8 and 10. It
depicts that firms with higher alliance experience are able to manage a significantly larger

number of alliances before reaching the inflection point than firms with less alliance
experience. Thus, firms with greater alliance experience appear to possess a greater
alliance management capability.

6. Discussion
While prior theoretical work has emphasized the notion of an alliance management
capability in creating and sustaining competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ireland
et al., 2002), empirical work is this area has been slow in coming, mainly due to
methodological impediments. We attempted to provide some preliminary empirical
evidence for an alliance management capability, and here focused on the effects of alliance
type and alliance experience in an entrepreneurial, high-technology setting. Since a
common problem in strategic management research is the fact that capabilities tend to be
unobservable (Godfrey and Hill, 1995), we focused on observable consequences of an
unobservable capability. We used the relationship between a firm’s alliances and new
product development to gain some understanding of the effects of alliance type and
alliance experience on a firm’s alliance management capability. In particular, we focused
on the point of diminishing total returns in the functional relationship between a firm’s
number of alliances and its new product development. While this represents necessarily an
indirect approach to the phenomenon of interest, alliance capability, we submit that this
research strategy is both novel and appropriate when relying on archival data. The sample
consisted of 325 global biotechnology firms that entered into over 2200 R&D alliances in
the 25-time period between 1973 and 1997. The empirical results were consistent with the

<-----Page 24----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

453

theoretical model proposed. We attempt to make a contribution to the literature in four
areas.
First, we found that an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of alliances
managed simultaneously and firm performance holds regardless of the type of the alliance
considered. We differentiated between upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances.
Prior research relating allying to firm performance in the entrepreneurial context has not
differentiated between different types of alliances (Shan et al., 1994; Deeds and Hill,
1996). This finding adds robustness to the notion that there exist diminishing returns to
high levels of alliance activity and that this relationship holds regardless of alliance type.
While we were able to generalize the relationship between allying and firm performance to
different alliance types, this exercise was merely a prerequisite to empirically investigate
the effects of alliance type and alliance experience on alliance management capability.
Second, we found that different alliance types place differential demands on a hightechnology venture’s alliance management capability. Here, we focused on the position of
the high-technology venture’s partners in the industry value chain, and highlighted
upstream, horizontal and downstream alliances. We argued that their differential demands
on a high-technology venture’s alliance management capability arise primarily from two
factors: the difference between the type of partners and the focal firm, and the type of
knowledge transferred through these alliances.
Third, we found support for a novel measure of alliance experience. The notion that a
firm’s alliance management capability is built through repeated alliance experiences over
time is central to a theory of an alliance management capability. While prior research has
proxied alliance experience mostly by a raw count of alliances, we employ a more subtle
measure, alliance years, which is theoretically more proximate to the notion of experience
accumulation (Dutton and Thomas, 1984). High-tech ventures with greater alliance
experience were able to manage productively a larger number of alliances, while explicitly
controlling for firm age, among other factors. Indeed, firm age was not significantly
correlated with alliance experience, indicating that an alliance management capability does
not simply occur with aging, but rather through the firm’s direct participation in alliances
over their life cycle. This finding further highlights the salience of alliance management
capability for entrepreneurial firms.
Taken together, these empirical results provide some evidence that an alliance
management capability exists and that it is heterogeneously distributed across firms. As
conceptualized in prior work (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ireland et al., 2002), it appears that
an alliance management capability can be the source of a firm-level competitive
advantage. Those firms that are able to manage a larger number of alliances effectively
should be able to achieve higher new product development. Indeed, the results indicated
that firms with greater alliance experience, all else being equal, achieved a greater level of
new product development (Fig. 2). Since most technology ventures’ competitive position
is determined by their ability to develop commercially viable products (Deeds et al., 2000),
firms that are more productive in new product development should have an advantage over
their competitors.
Yet, these results also seem to indicate that firms should strike a balance in entering
alliances. Too few or too many alliances appear not to be optimal, but an intermediate
number of alliances appears to be most beneficial. Entering too many alliances opens up

<-----Page 25----->454

F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

the venture to the risks of mismanagement, expropriation, and opportunism. On the other
hand, too few alliances put the venture at a competitive disadvantage in the crucial race to
develop new products. Moreover, it curtails their possibility of developing an alliance
management capability.
Finally, this study also speaks to the broader issue of capabilities. The methodological
approach supports the contention of Godfrey and Hill (1995) that tracking observable
consequences of capabilities, rather than attempting to directly measure unobservable
capabilities, is a fruitful approach to empirically testing capability theory in large scale,
quantitative studies. However, the results demonstrate more than just the observable
benefits from an unobservable capability. They also demonstrate that exceeding firm
capabilities is detrimental to firm performance and that capabilities are constrained in the
short term because they are built through experience over time (Teece et al., 1997).
6.1. Limitations and future research
This study contains several limitations, which in turn provide opportunities for future
research. While an area of contribution, one critical issue concerns the definition and
measurement of alliance management capability. We followed Godfrey and Hill’s (1995)
understanding of capabilities as unobservables, and thus relied on an indirect measure of
alliance management capability. In particular, we attempted to track one observable
consequence of a firm’s alliance management capability, the number of alliances a hightechnology venture can manage effectively. The absence of more direct measures of
alliance capability in archival data indicates the need for future research to employ survey
and qualitative methodologies to more directly proxy alliance management capability.
Further, our measure of alliance management is also incomplete to some extent since
we focus only on one aspect of alliance management capability when alliance management
capability is clearly a multi-dimensional construct. Other aspects include the ability to
select appropriate partners, to build trusting relationships, to absorb and apply new
knowledge gained, to develop tacit and codified routines and so forth (Dyer and Singh,
1998; Ireland et al., 2002). By drawing on the organizational learning and evolutionary
economics literature, for example, researchers should attempt to develop and test
alternative measures for an alliance management capability reflecting its multi-faceted
nature. Moreover, while we find some tentative evidence that a firm’s alliance
management capability is positively related to its performance, more work is clearly
needed to establish this relationship more firmly by linking it to other performance metrics
such as venture growth or financial performance.
While we advanced a novel measure to proxy a firm’s alliance management
capability, we assessed only the different inflection points at one point in time, at the
end of the study period. Yet, firms develop capabilities like an alliance management
capability over time. Future research could attempt to sketch the evolution of a firm’s
alliance management capability over time, and thus enhance our understanding of the
dynamics pertaining to development and maintenance of an alliance management
capability. The capability lifecycle model recently suggested by Helfat and Peteraf
(2003) might point the way to a more thorough empirical understanding of this type of
dynamic capability.

<-----Page 26----->F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

455

We also need to learn more about the question of how the rents to allying are
distributed, a particular salient issue for alliances between high-tech ventures and large
established firms (Alvarez and Barney, 2001). An alliance management capability could
allow a firm to not only create value through allying but also to appropriate the jointly
created value. Here, entrepreneurial ventures may have to make important trade-offs
concerning value creation and value appropriation when entering into alliances with
large, established firms. Prior research has provided some tangential evidence that the
large pharmaceuticals may have benefited from these alliances at the expense of the
smaller biotech ventures (Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004; Lerner et al., 2003; Rothaermel,
2001b). In particular, it appears that large pharmaceutical firms may lead in the learning
race (Hamel, 1991) because they appear to use alliances effectively to rebuild research
capabilities that were made obsolete by the biotechnology revolution (Rothaermel,
2001a). What is lacking in this study of entrepreneurial firms and alliances is empirical
evidence of how alliance value is created and appropriated. This is a critical area for
future research.
While these results seem to indicate that firms might be able to create a competitive
advantage based on a superior alliance management capability, they also underscore the
risks inherent in high levels of alliance activity, in particular, if a firm’s alliance intensity
outstrips its alliance management capability. Essentially, the number of alliances that a
firm can manage effectively need to be balanced, not too many alliances, but not too few
either. While we provide some preliminary evidence for factors that determine where this
balancing point may lay, we encourage future researchers to deepen our understanding of
alliance management capability and how to keep a venture near or at the balance point of
its alliance capability.
The results for alliance experience address only one source of potential alliance
experience, alliance management capability accumulated through repeated engagements in
the focal activity. A second source that demands additional study is role of the prior
alliance experience of the management teams. It is unlikely that a firm can simply buy
alliance experience in the labor market through hiring alliance-experienced managers
because the market price should anticipate any rent-generating potential (Barney, 1986).
Therefore, it appears that complex, embedded and partly tacit routines are at the root of a
competitive advantage derived from an alliance management capability. Important
questions such as the role of management recruiting and training as well as knowledge
management are fruitful topics for future research.
We highlighted alliance type and alliance experience in impacting alliance management
capability in the entrepreneurial context. Future research could investigate what other
factors, besides alliance type, alliance experience and the establishment of a dedicated
alliance function (Kale et al., 2002), are critical in developing and enhancing a firm’s
alliance management capability because most large firms have now established some type
of dedicated alliance function (Booz et al., 1997). Clearly, future research should attempt
to deepen our understanding of the processes of alliance management. A longitudinal field
study might address this topic most fruitfully.
While we focused on different alliance types in isolation (Hypothesis 2) and on the
combined effect of a given mixture of alliances (Hypothesis 3) when exploring a hightechnology venture’s alliance management capability, we did not investigate how different

<-----Page 27----->456

F.T. Rothaermel, D.L. Deeds / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 429–460

alliance types interact with one another, and thus we were not able to discuss the
differential impact of portfolios made up of different mixtures of upstream, horizontal and
downstream alliances on a firm’s alliance management capability. It is also important to
note that there may be important benefits to allying that are not captured by the dependent
variable, new product development, employed in this study.
As emphasized in the methods section above, the link between early stage upstream
alliances and new product development appears to be more tenuous than the link between
downstream alliances and new product development. This notion seems to be validated by
data presented by Lerner et al. (2003), who drew a random sample of 200 biotechnology
alliances begun since January 1980 and found that only 14% led to an approved drug by
December 1998. When focusing only on cooperative drug development projects that
already progressed to phase I or phase II of clinical trials, they found that likelihood of
success increased to 26%. This opens up a promising avenue of future research, in
particular, in light of the fact that that one upstream alliance might provide the basis for
several horizontal and downstream alliances.7
We focus on entrepreneurial biotechnology firms, and thus on a single, high-technology
industry. While such an approach controls for industry idiosyncrasies, it raises the question
of generalizability. The biotechnology industry is characterized by a highly uncertain and
risky new product development process that can extend over multiple years. Moreover,
regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency impose strict approval processes consisting of distinct and
sequential stages. Despite these unique characteristics, the transfer of basic science from
universities to start-ups and subsequently to established firms appears to be important in a
diverse set of industries. Recent empirical work has shown that this entrepreneurial
phenomenon seems to be generalizable beyond biotechnology, as it appears to hold across
a large number of different industries since university inventions are generally
commercialized by new ventures, which later either enter alliances with established firms
or are acquired altogether (Lowe and Ziedonis, 2003).
6.2. Managerial implications
The finding that the relationship between alliance intensity and firm performance
appears to be characterized by diminishing returns, and the notion that alliance experience
is built through cumulative alliance activity, often in a more or less simultaneous fashion,
also point to an interesting normative tension. High-technology ventures need to enter
alliances to gain access to critical resources and to build an alliance management
capability, yet, too many alliances, too early, may have detrimental effects. This yin and
yang of allying for entrepreneurial firms requires significant managerial skill. A manager
must understand the firm’s limits to its alliance management capability at a given point in
time, while realizing that alliance management capability is not finite but can be built
through repeated allying over time.
Taken together, the results should guide practitioners towards a cautious, balanced
approach to allying (Niederkofler, 1991). Managers should recognize that different

alliances place different demands on the venture’s alliance management capability. They
need to consider entering their next alliance not in isolation, but as part of the firm’s
overall portfolio of alliances and in the context of the firm’s alliance management
capability. While the opportunity presented by an alliance may appear to be significant, the
risks, given the firm’s existing alliances and current stage of development, may outweigh
the potential benefits. The right balance of alliances, under the right conditions, appears to
provide tangible benefits to a high-tech venture’s new product development. On the other
hand, too many alliances entered into early in the firm’s development, expose
entrepreneurial ventures to significant risks. Maximizing a firm’s benefits from allying
requires a manager to keep the venture near or at the balance point of its alliance
management capability. This balance point changes over time, making alliance
management a demanding, but potentially rewarding managerial task.
