Psychological Foundations of the Behavioral
Theory of Negotiation
Walton and McKersie’s Behavioral Theory of Labor Negotiation sought to provide a descriptive
theory of the process by which union and management negotiators reached settlements. Their
paper drew on existing psychology, behavioral decision theory, and game theory. The basic
psychological model of the negotiator was essentially the same as that used in most rational
choice theory. Since then descriptive research on negotiation has branched into numerous
subfields. Thompson recently characterized the state of research as a many sided prism. In this
paper we use recent developments in evolutionary psychology to suggest an alternative
psychological foundation for a general behavioral theory of negotiation. Such a theory would
not be wedded to the particular institutional structure of collective bargaining. It may begin to
synthesize the empirical regularities regarding different aspects of negotiation that have been
discovered since the work of Walton and McKersie.

Psychological Foundations of the Behavioral
Theory of Negotiation

Since Richard Walton and Robert McKersie (1965) published “A Behavioral Theory of
Labor Negotiation,” researchers in game theory, biology, and in the various disciplines of social
science have generated new insights regarding social interaction and conflict. Their book drew
upon “existing concepts and frameworks” of that time, from Ward Edwards, Thomas Schelling,
Herbert Simon, B. F. Skinner, and Fritz Heider (p. ix), to explain field research observations and
case studies in industrial relations. By taking the prevailing institutional structure of unionmanagement relations as the starting point, the two theorists were able to model the negotiation
process as a reasonably well-structured and repeatedly played game between two organizations,
a company and a union. The purpose was to derive a number of propositions about “how people
actually tend to behave and how elements of the process actually interact” in this particular
social context (p. 10). In the concluding section of the book Walton and McKersie speculated
about how the behavioral theory could be extended to address negotiation in other realms,
specifically international relations and the then turbulent struggle over civil rights. However, the
theory was developed around the context of union-management negotiations and its structure
largely reflected that setting.
While public sector union membership expanded during the 1970’s, the percentage of
private sector employees represented in a collective bargaining system has declined to just 8%
(see Figure 1, Farber, 2005). Providing a satisfactory descriptive theory of contemporary
workplace negotiation will therefore require a far more general and flexible approach, one not
grounded in the particular institutional structure of collective bargaining. The theory must be

<-----Page 2----->Behavioral Theory

capable of explaining the development of unique idiosyncratic contracts that Rousseau calls “IDeals” (2005). These increasingly common, highly personalized arrangements reflect special
combinations of commitments between the contracting parties that presumably create
considerable value for both organization and employee. Such deal-making does not fit readily
within the framework of a theory intended to explain collective bargaining.
While union membership has declined, social science has seen advances in game theory,
in cognitive science, in organization, and in studies on the biological basis of conflict. Interest
in using behavioral approaches to study economics, law, and the various functional areas of
business has also undergone a recent resurgence. Research output on the subject of negotiation
has itself rapidly expanded while also splintering into an ever increasing variety of approaches
(Thompson, 2005). Thompson referenced the various programs of negotiation research as a
multi-sided prism for understanding the process. Among others she identified the distinctive
contributions of the behavioral decision theory approach, the social cognition approach, the
motivation approach, the emotions approach, and the social network approach. In this paper we
first examine what is actually meant by the “behavioral approach” to social science. This
review makes clear that the ultimate objective of the “behavioral” program, of which behavioral
decision theory was an important element, was the development of integrative, interdisciplinary
social science rather than separate, fragmented, multi-disciplinary perspectives.
Walton and McKersie attempted to push the study of negotiation in the direction of this
kind of integrated, interdisciplinary study. Focusing on the context of collective bargaining
limited the potential generality of their theory. Moreover, starting from a basic psychology of
the chief negotiators that derived from von Neumann and Morgenstern’s axiomatic theory of
choice further constrained their ability to develop behavioral theory. We describe an alternative,

<-----Page 3----->Behavioral Theory

modular approach to cognition, that provides a more promising foundation for the development
of a general behavioral theory of negotiation. The ultimate goal of such an approach is to
generate theory capable of integrating insights derived from the multiple facets of the prism of
contemporary negotiation research.
What is the Behavioral Approach?
The recent upsurge of interest in “behavioral” approaches to research questions in social
science has encompassed most basic disciplines including economics, the discipline commonly
regarded as the bastion of rational choice theory (Camerer, 2007; Kahneman, 2003). Interest
within basic science has also been accompanied by new applications within professional fields,
including law (Sunstein, 2000), public finance (McCarrey, 1994), and each of the functional
areas of business. The study of human resource management, organization design and marketing
have long had highly active behavioral programs. Only recently have rational choice models of
organization even begun to appear (Milgrom and Roberts, 1992). But in recent years, even the
fields of finance (Jolls, Sunstein, & Thaler, 1998; Thaler, 1993) and operations (Bendoly,
Donahue, and Schultz, 2006), for some time dominated by rational choice theory, have seen an
upsurge in behavioral research. Behavioral finance, for example, examines portfolio choices
made by agents who do not update their beliefs using Bayes’ theorem or who fail to make utility
maximizing choices (Barber and O’Dean, 2000). Behavioral corporate finance addresses the
larger implications of individual biases for the financial investments made by large corporations
(Shefrin, 2006).
But, does this correlated activity merely represent a potentially brief and faddish trend or
is it indicative of a more long term paradigm shift in the social sciences? What are the
implications for the study of conflict and negotiation? Conflict is a basic element of social life

<-----Page 4----->Behavioral Theory

that is at the foundation of each of these areas of inquiry. Law is established to regulate conflict.
Organization is meant to channel it predictably and productively toward the achievement of a
common good. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the meaning of the “behavioral approach”
and of behavioral science, appraise and synthesize current progress, and discuss a new
foundation for development of a behavioral theory of negotiation.
Recent Speculations. The recent behavioral studies commonly begin with at least an
abbreviated attempt at outlining the history, development, and distinctive meaning of
“behavioral” research. Bendoly, Donahue, and Schultz (2006) appear to mostly associate
behavioral research with recent experimental studies of economic behavior. They describe
behavioral research as essentially deriving from the experimental work that tested various
aspects of the theory of games published by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). McCaffery
and Baron (2003) argue for the need to apply findings from behavioral research to the problem of
establishing proper tax policy. While noting that Herbert Simon’s work on “bounded rationality”
was an important starting point they focus most heavily on the judgment heuristics and biases
program of research (Kahneman, 2003; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Gilovich, Griffin,
& Kahneman, 2003). Others (Jolls, Sunstein, & Thaler, 1998; Hogarth, 2006) follow a similar
course in reviewing historical developments. Camerer (2007), for example, describes Herbert
Simon as “a towering figure in the development of behavioral economics” (p. 25) but one whose
influence by cognitive science and information processing theory have not had as much
influence as the heuristics and biases program in contemporary research.
So the various authors consistently cite Simon, Kahneman, and Tversky for their
formative contributions to behavioral research. Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky (1982)
themselves cite three origins from the 1950’s for the heuristics and biases program. These

<-----Page 5----->Behavioral Theory
6
include Paul Meehl’s comparisons of clinical and statistical prediction, Ward Edwards’ studies
of subjective probability, and the “investigation of heuristics and strategies of reasoning, for
which Herbert Simon offered a program and Jerome Bruner an example” (p. xi). These varied
histories correlate reasonably well with some recent accounts of research in negotiation.
Thompson (2006) sees negotiation research as having roots in “economic theory”, specifically
citing Nash and von Neumann and Morgernstern’s game theoretic treatments of bargaining. She
then describes “bounded rationality and faulty decision making” (i.e. behavioral decision theory)
as “the first descriptive theory of negotiation” (p. 3).

Bazerman and Chugh (2006) date the

origins of its specific application to the understanding of negotiation to Raiffa (1982), but they
too refer to Kahneman, Tversky, and Simon as the formative figures in behavioral decision
theory. The oldest work referenced as part of this behavioral theory is Simon (1957).
The Behavioral Revolution of the 1920’s. Curiously Simon’s own account points
toward much earlier origins for the behavioral approach and the concept of limited rationality.
When he began his graduate study in political science in the 1930’s, the behavioral revolution
was already underway. He described his own teacher, Harold Lasswell, as “the leading
behavioralist of them all” (Simon, 1993, p. 49) and referred to Graham Wallas (Wallas, 1902)
and Walter Lippmann (1922) as the pioneers who had laid the foundations for the behavioral
revolution. Examining the way in which Lippmann’s research has been cited over the decades
in economics, psychology, sociology, political science, and management research, Bottom,
Kong, and Zhang (2006) found a strong element of largely unrecognized circularity at work in
the behavioral literature.
Lippmann actually based his pioneering behavioral theory of stereotypes, biased human
judgment, and decision-making on participant observation of a deeply flawed negotiation that

<-----Page 6----->Behavioral Theory
7
had disastrous long term consequences, the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. His cognitive or
social cognitive theory, which has anticipated much recent work on the subject (Bottom, 2003;
Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Schneider, 2002) was embedded in a far larger social and
organizational theory. Those social theories have had a considerable impact on the development
of social science and its application to policy and to professional education (Bottom, 2006;
LaViolette & Silvert, 1952; MacGilvray, 1999; O’Connor, 1999). So there is ample reason to
believe that a very general behavioral theory of negotiation is possible and that stereotypes,
judgment bias, and bounded rationality should be components. Lippmann provided the
beginnings of that theory.
Defining Behavioral Theory. What were the defining features of this behavioral
revolution? How well does it match contemporary use of the term? In fact, current users rarely
provide much precision in their use of the term “behavioral”. Thaler (1993) defined “behavioral
finance” as nothing more than “open minded finance” which combines a “concern for real world
problems and a willingness to consider all explanations”.

Some attempt no definition at all.

Rather than seek to define “behavioral decision theory” Hogarth (2005) indicates that it is
founded on 10 basic ideas that include “judgment can be modeled,” “rationality is bounded,” and
“understanding tasks is more important than understanding people”.
However the earlier generation of behavioral researchers struggled with a definition as
well. Dahl (1961) characterized it as “like the Loch Ness monster: one can say with considerable
confidence what it is not, but it is difficult to say what it is … The behavioral approach is not that
of the speculative philosopher, the historian, the legalist, or the moralist (p. 763)”. Ultimately he
concluded that it was a protest movement against the limitations of those forms of inquiry and
for empirical observation grounded in interdisciplinary affiliation with “modern psychology,

<-----Page 7----->Behavioral Theory
8
sociology, anthropology, and economics”. The “rapid flowering” of the movement was due, in
his estimation, to several “specific interrelated, quite powerful” forces. Charles Merriam’s
leadership of the Political Science department at the University of Chicago produced Lasswell,
Simon, and other crucial behavioral scientists. The Second World War forced social scientists to
confront administrative problems that respected none of the disciplinary boundaries of academic
scholarship. The Social Science Research Council (founded by Merriam in 1923) actively
promoted interdisciplinary behavioral research and provided funding solicited from the
Rockefeller and Carnegie philanthropies to promising behavioral scholars like Lasswell, Elton
Mayo, and Simon.
Dahl discerned that the protest was decaying and disappearing as an identifiable
movement because of its very success, it was becoming the social scientific mainstream. As it
became conventional, there would be no need to think of “behavioral” social science as distinct
from any other form. Of course rational choice theory was just then beginning to provide an
alternative paradigm that would challenge the incorporation of behavioral social science into the
mainstream of at least some disciplines. The predicted withering of the behavioral movement
failed to materialize.
Perhaps the clearest and most useful definition of the behavioral approach was provided
by the diverse editorial team that launched the journal Behavioral Science in the 1950’s. The
group included a social psychologist (Alex Bavelas), an economic theorist (Jacob Marschak), a
mathematical biologist (Anatol Rapoport), a political scientist (David Easton), and a physiologist
(R. W. Gerard). Their vision for the field was development of a social science that would permit
us to fathom “with some precision the laws of human nature which can produce social inequality,
industrial strife, marital disharmony, juvenile delinquency, mental illness, war, and other

<-----Page 8----->Behavioral Theory
9
widespread miseries” (Alexander, et al., 1952). It would succeed at this by integrating “the
fragments of multiple sciences” including biology, biochemistry, genetics, psychology,
sociology, economics, politics, anthropology, history, and others in order to “avoid the
inadequacies in the present studies of man.”
Of current attempts at definition, Camerer (2007) comes closest to capturing the full
scope and ambition of the true behavioral program for social science. He defines “behavioral
economics” as a “field that “applies models of systematic imperfections in human rationality to
the study and engineering of organizations, markets, and policy”. According to Camerer these
imperfections result from “an evolved brain with limited attention.” The definition of the
Behavioral Science editorial team suggests that it may be time to attempt integrating the multiple
fragments of negotiation research rather than acknowledging the equal validity of alternative
perspectives on the subject (Thompson, 2006). Before attempting to describe possible
psychological foundations for such a general theory, we first consider how Walton and McKersie
modeled the psychology of the chief negotiator for union and for management.
Walton and McKersie’s Four Process Model
Walton and McKersie broke the collective bargaining process down into four different
subprocesses which were each modeled separately. The distributive bargaining model explained
the system of activities the bargainers employed in an attempt to resolve pure conflicts of
interest. In the context of collective bargaining these activities naturally arise in attempts to
contract for a wage rate. The union will employ bargaining tactics to raise the wage over the life
of the contract while the company employs tactics to keep wages down. The integrative
bargaining model, after Follett’s (1940) use of the term, refers to activities that permit the
attainment of objectives of the parties that are not in fundamental conflict, where the gains of one

<-----Page 9----->Behavioral Theory
10
party do not require equal loss by the other party. The attitudinal structuring model explained
the set of activities that enable the “attainment of desired relationship patterns” between the
parties. This “socioemotional interpersonal process” encompasses friendliness, trust, respect,
and cooperativeness. The final subprocess, interorganizational bargaining, reflects the process of
aligning expectations of the principals in the union (rank and file, other officers) or in the
company (shareholders, other managers) with the chief negotiator.
In attempting to synthesize these four subprocesses to understand their parallel operation
during a complex negotiation, Walton and McKersie reflected on some of the tradeoffs between
accomplishing objectives associated with each of the subprocesses. “Distributive bargaining …
includes many tactic operations which tend to manipulate, deceive, and coerce. Party’s efforts to
build trust and be trusting need to take into account the nature of this activity.” (p. 357).
Based on their evaluation of case data from General Electric, General Motors, and
International Harvester, they concluded that the chief negotiator attempts to rationally weigh
tradeoffs between the subprocesses. In Walton and McKersie’s view, they tend to succeed most
of the time. “As researchers we were continuously amazed at how much of the total behavior
produced in a negotiating session was appropriate tactically when we analyzed the interactions in
terms of the four-process framework.” (p. 354). Much of the rational action appeared instinctive
or automatic rather than the product of conscious calculation. It simply happened too quickly to
be the product of extensive calcuation but, whatever its source, Walton and McKersie concluded
that it was almost always highly instrumental for the attainment of goal tradeoffs. Given that the
chief negotiators in these collective bargaining cases were seasoned, expert professionals this
represents a further qualification of their behavioral theory. Is it possible to derive a more
general synthesis that can explain both novice and expert negotiators with potentially varying

<-----Page 10----->Behavioral Theory
11
degrees of limited rationality? The i-Deal phenomenon means that negotiations on behalf of
labor are increasingly conducted by the principals themselves. The level of experience and skill
at negotiation is likely to be far more variable than the cases Walton and McKersie modeled.
A Psychological Foundation for a Behavioral Theory
Development of a more general behavioral theory of negotiation will require moving
further from the model of rational individual choice that underpins both the more traditional
game theoretic treatments of negotiation (eg. Binmore and Das Gupta, 1980). Walton and
McKersie (1965) largely retained this basic model of individual choice as a foundation for
analyzing labor negotiations. They simply acknowledged that actual choices might reflect some
limits on individual ability to make optimal decisions. However they were not very specific
about when these limits would become binding constraints and how constrained rationality
affects settlement. If we relax the assumption that negotiations are always conducted by
experienced, highly skilled chief negotiators selected for their negotiation competence then we
must conclude that the constraints are likely to impact choices far more frequently than it did in
the limited cases studied by Walton and McKersie.
Camerer indicated that the limitations on rationality arise from an evolved brain with
limited attention. The early drivers of the behavioral revolution sought specifically to understand
how evolutionary pressures influenced human neurophysiology. The intense collaboration
between psychologist Elton Mayo and biochemist Lawrence Henderson at Harvard Business
School during the 1920’s and 30’s, as an example, generated early breakthroughs in the
application of a behavioral approach to worker productivity and conflict. The pair sought to
understand the psychophysiology of industrial fatigue and its impact on conflict between worker
and manager. They also examined equilibrium in complex social systems like business

<-----Page 11----->Behavioral Theory
12
organizations through analogy to the homeostatic properties of the human body (Mayo, 1933;
O’Connor, 1998). However their progress on understanding the biological substrate for
cognition and bounded rationality was limited by the scientific instrumentation of that time
period. Mayo and Henderson could study variation in blood chemistry and gastrointestinal
activity but they obviously lacked access to the direct recording of neurological activity now
available to contemporary behavioral researchers like Camerer (2007) or Bechara and Damasio
(2005). Current behavioral researchers appear to view the Mayo-Henderson research as
somehow distinct from or irrelevant to the behavioral decision theory program. Actually it was
an early breakthrough, particularly in the application of behavioral research to workplace
conflict. Simon’s teacher Harold Lasswell, the man Simon (1992) referred to as “the greatest
behavioralist of them all” was Mayo’s first research assistant on this project.
Developing a general behavioral theory may benefit from adoption of this broader
concept of understanding and modeling limitations created by evolved neurophysiological
systems rather than specific decision rules or specific heuristics. Trivers (1971) theorized about
the existence of an evolved psychological system that regulates social exchange, specifically
permitting the evolution of human cooperation through reciprocal altruism. This form of
altruism consists of costly actions undertaken for the benefit of biologically unrelated individuals
or at least sufficiently unrelated so that enhancing the reproductive advantage of kin cannot be
the cause of action. Among diverse human societies and in different time periods such behavior
has taken the form of food sharing, aid to the sick or aged, sharing tools, and sharing knowledge.
Trivers argued that human neuroanatomical structure evolved to support a complex regulating
system to permit the extension of reciprocal altruism selectively to some, though not all. The
nine key characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

<-----Page 12----->Behavioral Theory
13
The exchange of labor for monetary and other forms of compensation clearly represents a
common modern example of reciprocal altruism in an industrial society. As Mayo (1933) took
pains to point out, human biology evolved under conditions where social exchange was quite
different than this. Industrial conflict may escalate in part because of a failed understanding by
managers of the evolved human nature they confronted. The labor negotiation process that
Walton and McKersie studied in the 1960’s consisted of attempts by pairs of chief negotiators to
arrive at the terms by which such exchanges would be effected for a period of several years for a
large coalition of employees and one firm. The cognitive capabilities associated with
recognizing faces and detecting potential cheaters on reciprocal exchange are therefore systems
aspects of considerable relevance to understanding the kind of tradeoffs between attitudinal
structuring (open communication and trust) and distributive bargaining described in the
behavioral theory of labor negotiation. According to Trivers, the emotions associated with
friendship and affection, which Walton and McKersie characterized as part of “the proper pattern
of relationships” between negotiating parties, emerge endogenously from exchange history
between the parties. They then impact the future course of potential exchange or negotiation.
Over time, the pattern of relationships, specifically the social knowledge and friendships, can be
seen as providing the kind of enduring social structure modeled by McGinn (2006) in the “social
network” approach to studying negotiation. They along with the more specific emotions of
indignation, gratitude, and guilt comprise integral aspects of the regulatory system.

The

activation of these highly specific emotions flows from a consideration of possible cheating on
reciprocal exchange.
Cosmides and Tooby (1998) elaborated on the cognitive architecture of Trivers
regulatory system. Their list of 14 required design features are shown in Table 2.

<-----Page 13----->Behavioral Theory
14

They also provided some compelling evidence that human neuroanatomy has evolved highly
specialized capabilities associated with the detection of potential cheaters. Bottom, Holloway,
Miller, Mislin, and Whitford (2006) showed how these specialized capabilities affected the
negotiation and implementation of contracts between principals and agents in a controlled
experiment. The observed contracts and subsequent agent implementation was quite consistent
with the operation of the hypothesized evolved algorithms. It violated game theoretic predictions
based on a psychology of rational choice. Mislin (2006) extended these findings, showing how
proposed contract terms and agent emotion interact to affect both contract implementation and
trust between the parties.
An examination of the design features in Figure 2 illustrates the highly complementary
nature of the multifaceted research that has been conducted on negotiation to date. It is certainly
possible to view these, as Thompson (2006) has done, as different perspectives on a complex
phenomenon. Perhaps that is the most natural way to think about studies that have employed
different terminology, instrumentation, and research designs. However, it also seems possible to
see that research as involving the isolation of the operation of certain algorithms in this complex
regulating system. Or in other cases the research has isolated the interaction between selected
subsets of the algorithms. The emotions approach to negotiation, for example, has provided
insight into the operation of algorithms 10 and 11 on the detection of cheating and the
punishment of cheating. The development of affection and friendship colors the stored exchange
history with an emotional tinge that affects the calculation of costs and benefits in future
exchanges with a given partner and the likelihood of cheating by that partner. That broader
perspective suggests that many of the necessary elements of a very general behavioral theory of

<-----Page 14----->Behavioral Theory
15
negotiation have already been established. Such theory should be founded on an understanding
of the interaction of the complex psychological system supporting reciprocal altruism rather than
the basic von Neumann-Morgenstern choice axioms.
Though at this point it is little more than a possible sketch of the complex process, Figure
2 represents a process model of the activation of algorithms in the regulating system. The
elaboration highlights several important elements. First, it introduces the essential interactive
aspect of these algorithms. Even the simplest bilateral exchange is simultaneously experienced
by both parties. Both parties must process various calculations leading up to and following from
Cosmides and Tooby’s “cheater detection” algorithm. It also highlights the circular pattern of
influence in the model. The result of one interaction and exchange between parties in the
bilateral relationship will have an impact both on the likelihood that these parties will engage in a
future exchange, in the nature of that future interaction, and in its eventual outcome.
It develops further the nature of the algorithm that stores information about the history of
one’s past exchanges with other individuals. We refer to this algorithm as “social accounting.”
It is obviously closely related to Kramer’s (1996) conception of “the intuitive auditor” and to the
concept of “mental accounting” (Thaler, 1998) in the literature of behavioral decision theory.
Evolution of Social Accounting
Of course contemporary commercial practices rely on a highly sophisticated and codified set
of rules to facilitate vast amounts of exchange between distant and sometimes completely
unknown parties. The historical record traces formal accounts back to imprints found on clay
tablets in Egypt and Mesopotamia as early as 2000 to 3300 B.C (Brown, 1968). These formal
rules must actually have emerged as an outgrowth and improvement on the informal and intuitive
practices of trading in earlier society. As trading frequency began to exceed the capacity for

<-----Page 15----->Behavioral Theory
16
unerring memory, individuals and governments began to keep formal records of their
transactions. At first these were simply an unorganized listing of the terms of exchange. Only
over time did the emergence of the profession of accounting begin to perfect methods of keeping
books. It did not, however, eliminate the intuitive practices of accounting. It is the intuitive
system that actually still serves to regulate most forms of social exchange.
Under the guise of “mental accounting,” decision researchers have examined some of the
properties and behavioral implications of intuitive accounting (Thaler, 1985). Mental accounting
research focuses on the processing of exchange involving money. Money is of course a store of
value introduced to facilitate large scale exchange.

But exchange predated the evolution of the

money economy and most social exchange still occurs without its use. The study of mental
accounting has thus far concentrated on exchange mediated by money and largely devoid of both
interpersonal contact and affect. It has examined the perception and evaluation of outcomes
involving the receipt or disbursement of money and how these experiences and perceptions
influence decision-making (Thaler, 1985).
Individuals create distinct accounts for different types of spending activities (Thaler &
Shefrin, 1999). Research has examined how transactions are assigned to different accounts, how
frequently these accounts are evaluated, and how account balances affect subsequent choices.
People experience more pleasure through separate small monetary gains than they do over one
large gain equal to the sum of the smaller gains. The influence of loss aversion on mental
accounting is significant. A negative financial event has a disutility or psychological impact that
is greater than the positive utility experienced from an equivalent positive financial event.
Mental accounting processes appear to be at least somewhat oriented toward what might be
called hedonic efficiency. Where it is possible, people will encode combinations of financial

<-----Page 16----->Behavioral Theory
17
transactions in a way that would appear to be designed to make them as happy as possible
(Thaler, 1999) though the process appears somewhat more complex than that(Linville & Fischer,
1991; Thaler & Johnson, 1990).
Given the relatively recent development of the money economy, the particular features of
a cognitive module or modules for social exchange are very likely to predate human experience
with monetary transactions. The environmental pressures that would have given rise to these
features were then influenced by small scale exchange arising out of interpersonal relations, not
in highly efficient markets with stable currencies. So the rules governing mental accounting
involving financial exchange is probably best seen as a special case of the more general rules that
would govern the cognitive adaptations for social exchange. The study of these special cases has
provided valuable insights for understanding the more general setting. But much more research
is clearly needed regarding these algorithms.
The role of social accounting in the seemingly irrational escalation of commitments is
one area worthy of more empirical investigation. Conlon and Garland (1993) found considerable
evidence for the effect of project completion on the tendency to escalate. This cognitivemotivational explanation may be enhanced in many situations by emotional forces associated
with the drive to balance social accounts. The force of guilt and reparative altruism in Trivers’
theory would predict escalation of the commitment of resources to courses of action that would
be irrational without considering prior exchange histories. Specific, testable predictions about
escalation should be feasible. But even more pressing is the need for further integrative research
on the interaction of the various other algorithms in this complex system. As Thompson’s
(2006) recent compilation indicates we know a great deal about isolated elements. We need to

<-----Page 17----->Behavioral Theory
18
work toward a fuller understanding of how these elements interact with each other in both very
simple and relatively more complex negotiations.
Discussion
There is a large and growing literature consisting of formal, very general theories of
bargaining based on the assumptions of rational choice (Binmore & Dasgupta, 1989). Empirical
and experimental evidence indicates that these theories are not accurate predictors of actual
bargaining behavior. Other approaches to the study of negotiation have generated a rich mix of
empirical regularities that led Thompson (2006) to characterize its study has a many sided prism.
Each side of this prism reflects an attempt to understand the actual behavior of negotiators and to
work towards a truly descriptive theory. This paper examined the basic assumptions and
propositions of an earlier descriptive theory, Walton and McKersie’s “behavioral theory of labor
negotiations”.
That theory was embedded in the well defined structure of collective bargaining. It
defined four subprocesses that together could explain the course and outcome of complex cases
in industrial relations of that period. We argued that it should be possible to craft a more general
behavioral theory of negotiation that does not assume the structure of union-management
relations in the United States. Given the decline of unionism in the private sector of the
economy such a general theory is much needed to help understand contemporary workplace
bargaining.
The psychological system Trivers identified that regulates reciprocal altruism provides a
potentially useful framework for developing a behavioral theory of negotiation. Empirical
evidence is consistent with the idea that humans have evolved very specialized cognitive systems
for processing information pertaining to social exchange. It can also provide a consistent

<-----Page 18----->Behavioral Theory
19
account of the distributive, integrative, and attitudinal structuring models that Walton and
McKersie (1966) constructed in their behavioral theory of labor negotiation. The disparate
negotiation research literatures can be viewed as focusing on different aspects of this complex
cognitive architecture.
Examination of this framework reveals the need for much more research on a number of
key aspects of exchange. Because laboratory experimentation has been the most common
means of investigation in recent years, the research has focused largely on relatively brief
interactions and on the construction of the terms of agreement. More research will be needed to
understand properties of the memory systems used to store information about the history of past
negotiations and exchange with particular partners. These would appear to provide the
foundation for an intuitive system of social accounting of the kind discussed by Kramer (1996).
How that information interacts with other algorithms in the system is still poorly understood. It
may prove possible to connect the rules of social accounting to the extensive set of empirical
regularities regarding social motives and negotiation behavior recently reviewed by De Dreu and
Carnevale (2003).
The present paper has simply provided some indication of opportunities for crafting a
general theory. Much more extensive work will need to be done to accomplish this conceptual
task. Success in that undertaking should begin to provide a compelling descriptive analog to the
normative rational choice theories. It may also help facilitate a greater recognition of the
overarching goals of the behavioral program of research that is currently undergoing a renewed
surge of popularity in a wide variety of fields. Understanding “with some precision the laws of
human nature which can produce social inequality, industrial strife, marital disharmony, juvenile
delinquency, mental illness, war, and other widespread miseries” (Alexander, et al., 1952) will

<-----Page 19----->Behavioral Theory
20
be greatly facilitated by the development of a general behavioral theory of negotiation along
these lines. Walton and McKersie (1965) provided a useful, if institution specific, starting point
for us to build upon.

FIGURE 2.
THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS OF SOCIAL EXCHANGE
Step 1: Need
Person A has a need

Step 2: Social Prediction
Person A determines who to ask to fulfill
this need based on
• Perception of capability
• Existing affection
• Perception of social debt
• Perception of trustworthiness
• Access (transaction cost)
 Person A chooses person B

Step 7: Update Social Account
A and B update social accounts based on:
• Perceptions of the outcome
• Affective tone
• Perceived cost (effort) involved in social
exchange

Step 6: Affection Updates
A and B form/update affective perceptions of the other as
a future index for judging social gamble. This is based on:
• Perceptions of the outcome
• Prior affective tone
• Social interactions during exchange
• Timing of reciprocity (Immediate? Delayed?)

Step 5: Outcome
Perceived value and cost of outcome depend on:
• Perceived effort
• Perceived capability
• Perceived need
• Exogenous factors

Emotion

Step 3: Evaluate Social Risk/ Bargaining
B determines if should engage in social exchange with A
• Is there an opportunity to create value?
• Is this a worthwhile investment? (Cost benefit analysis)
– Affective tone of A
– Perception of social indebtedness to A
– Perception of capability of A (to assess value of future
indebtedness of A)
– Perception of trustworthiness (to assess likelihood of
future reciprocity of A)
• Is this a risky investment?

Step 4: Social Exchange
A and B engage in social exchange

Emotion

Step 5: Outcome

Step 6: Update Social
Account
