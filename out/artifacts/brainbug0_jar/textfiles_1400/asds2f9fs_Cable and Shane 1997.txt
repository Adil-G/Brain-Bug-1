New business startups with venture capital backing depend on mutual cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, but
little is known about what makes these relationships work. The present article considers the implicit similarities between entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships and the Prisoner's Dilemma framework, using this paradigm to develop a conceptual model of entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' decisions to cooperate. The model is
used to generate a number of testable propositions concerning longterm cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Implications of the model for researchers, entrepreneurs, and venture
capitalists are discussed, and the paper concludes by examining implications of the entrepreneur-venture capitalist context for the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma framework.

"We need each other. We're in the same lifeboat; once we've
cut the mooring and written the check and are rowing out to
sea with the guy (sic), we can either pull in the same direction
or we can hit each other over the head with the oars." (Venture
capitalist quoted in Sapienza, 1989)
Venture capital-backed start-ups are an important source of innovation and technological development and serve as a major source of new
wealth creation in the United States (e.g., Bygrave & Timmons, 1991). In
fact, venture capital-backed initial public offerings have accounted for
one third of the market value of all initial public offerings in the United
States each year (Sahlman, 1990). Historically, these ventures have created approximately 230,000 jobs and have spent over $5 billion on research and development annually (Bygrave & Timmons, 1991). Some wellknown examples of these ventures include Apple Computer, Intel, Federal
Express, Lotus Development, Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation,
and Microsoft (e.g., Sahlman, 1990).

It is not surprising that the importance of these large-scale startups
has resulted in repeated calls for greater scholarly understanding of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships (Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996).
Although previous researchers have examined how venture capitalists
evaluate entrepreneurs' business plans and their negotiation processes
(e.g., MacMillan, Kulow, & Khovlian, 1989), almost no researchers have
investigated entrepreneurs' and investors' relationships after a venture
has been funded (Bruno & Tyebjee, 1985). This lack of investigation is
surprising, especially given Timmons and Bygrave's (1986) finding that an
ongoing cooperative relationship between entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists was more important to the performance of ventures than the
provision of venture capital itself. Currently, no theoretical model is available to guide future empirical investigation or to integrate past findings
on this topic (Bowden, 1994). Given the far-reaching positive effects of
venture capital-backed startups, it is important to understand the processes that promote cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists.
In this article, we develop a conceptual model of the relationships
between entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists
during the postinvestment period (i.e., after the two parties agree to collaborate). First, we
demonstrate that cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists is a necessary condition for the success of venture capital-backed
startups. We then present a conceptual model of entrepreneur-venture
capitalist cooperation based on past research from the Prisoner's Dilemma research literature (Axelrod & Dion, 1988), introducing specific
propositions concerning entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' cooperation or defection strategies. Finally, we discuss the implications of the
model for venture capital researchers, entrepreneurs and investors, and
the Prisoner's Dilemma itself.
THE NEED FOR ENTREPRENEUR-VENTURECAPITALISTCOOPERATION
We submit that some degree of mutual cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists is a necessary (though not sufficient)
condition for the successful post-investment performance of venture capital-backed start-ups. As discussed below, knowledge specificity creates a
division of labor between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, enhancing firm value. The lack of an efficient market for entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists explains why cooperation is needed to manage this
division of labor. Knowledge specificity means that entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists each specialize in the development and contribution of
different types of knowledge, allowing each party to exploit its comparative advantage. For example, venture capitalists' business networks allow them to tap funds more cheaply than entrepreneurs. Moreover, learning curve effects reinforce these initial advantages as each party improves its specialized activities.

Entrepreneurs specialize in the development of two types of knowledge. First, an entrepreneur is alert to unexploited opportunities and has
working knowledge about combining intangible and tangible resources
to exploit these opportunities in a novel fashion (Kirzner, 1973). Second,
entrepreneurs specialize in the day-to-day development of new business
activities (e.g., MacMillan et al., 1989). Venture capitalists, on the other
hand, specialize in creating networks of individuals and institutions to
reduce the cost of acquiring capital, to find customers and suppliers, and
to establish the venture's credibility (Lam, 1991; MacMillan et al., 1989;
Sahlman, 1990). Venture capitalists also advise and monitor new ventures,
helping entrepreneurs to formulate and adhere to their business strategy,
and identifying the appropriate management for the company (Steier &
Greenwood, 1995).
Knowledge specificity differentiates the cooperative activities of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists from that which exists in many other
business settings. In many other settings, two parties may cooperate, not
because they have complimentary assets, but to obtain monopoly power
or to take advantage of economies of scale. For example, two firms may
cooperate to reduce the amount of competition in the steel industry, while
two pharmaceutical companies may cooperate to achieve scale economies in drug development.
Although knowledge specialization between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists enhances the early development and value of large-scale
start-ups (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992), the question remains: Why is cooperation the best mechanism for managing this relationship? Long-term
cooperation is essential to venture-capital backed startups for multiple
reasons, each dealing with the lack of an efficient market. First, the
knowledge held by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists is specific to the
individuals. For example, knowing how to develop and exploit a new
technology generally is specific to a particular entrepreneur, and a venture capitalist is unlikely to locate another entrepreneur with the skills
necessary to exploit that same opportunity. Replacements also are in
short supply for entrepreneurs, because few venture capitalists invest in
a given industry, and the venture capitalists that do exist in a given
industry are deeply embedded in networks. Thus, many venture capitalists who would be interested in a venture will likely already be indirectly
invested (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). Furthermore, the small, networked
nature of entrepreneur-venture capitalist communities ensures that reputation effects echo loudly, damaging a party's reputation if they are
known to be non-cooperative (Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996). Finally, even
if replacement venture capitalists or entrepreneurs exist, the search and
negotiation costs for alternative parties are prohibitively high (Sapienza,
1989).
In fact, the lack of an efficient market for venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs is one component of this business relationship that differentiates it from other exchange contexts in which two business partners

<-----Page 4----->1997

Cable and Shane

145

face the choice of cooperation or defection. In many business settings
there are a large number of potential replacements for each counterpart.
In settings in which neither counterpart has a preponderance of unique
characteristics it is relatively easy for either party to replace the other. For
example, it is common for franchisors to replace or add new franchisees,
and it is not difficult for a consumer to locate other sources for a product.
The lack of an active replacement market for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists makes cooperation critical to the success of a venture once the
relationship is started.
In summary, the creation of large-scale new ventures usually requires entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to work together (Amit, Glosten, & Muller, 1990a). These startups benefit from the specialization of
venture capitalists in network activities and monitoring and the specialization of entrepreneurs in opportunity exploitation and the operation of
the venture. Given the lack of an efficient replacement market for either
party, mutual, long-term cooperation of both entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists is critical to the survival and subsequent success of a largescale start-up. However, previous researchers have little examined the
antecedents of entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' cooperation decisions. One major source of past research on cooperation decisions is the
Prisoner's Dilemma framework, which appears to provide an effective
approach for understanding entrepreneur-venture
capitalist relationships. Accordingly, in the next section of this article we describe the
Prisoner's Dilemma and demonstrate its applicability to the venture capital context. We then introduce a conceptual model and a series of propositions concerning each party's willingness to maintain a cooperative
relationship.
PRISONER'S DILEMMACONCEPTUAL MODEL OF
ENTREPRENEUR-VENTURECAPITALISTCOOPERATION
Prisoner's Dilemma Paradigm
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a well-known metaphor used in psychological, sociological, and economic research to model situations of social
conflict between two or more interdependent actors (Dawes, 1980; Luce &
Raiffa, 1957; Pruitt, 1967; Rapoport & Chammah, 1965). The essence of the
dilemma is that each individual actor has an incentive to act according to
competitive, narrow self-interest even though all actors are collectively
better off (i.e., receive higher rewards) if they cooperate. As depicted in
Figure 1, the strategies for each actor can be summarized as cooperation
(seek mutual gains at the expense of short-term self-interest) or defection
(seek individual gains at the expense of long-term mutual benefit). Consistent with past research (e.g., Axelrod & Dion, 1988), the payoffs for each
actor are dictated by the strategy adopted by the other actor and follow
the payoff structure T> R> P> S. T represents the temptation of extra payoff
from defection; R represents the reward for mutual cooperation; P

<-----Page 5----->Academy of Management Review

signifies the penalty for mutual defection; and S represents the sucker's
payoff (the penalty for cooperating while the other actor defects). This
payoff structure illustrates the Dilemma's conceptual value by highlighting the conflict between individual and collective rationality: While defection is the optimal choice for an individual who does not know his
counterpart's strategy, cooperation is collectively optimal for both parties
(Komorita, Hilty, & Parks, 1991). Since the Prisoner's Dilemma usually has
multiple stages (i.e., repetitions), actors' cooperation-defection decisions
during one round affect decisions made during subsequent rounds, which
may alter the utility of any particular defection or cooperation decision.
Thus, each actor can observe their partner's actions, making reciprocity and
trust critical components of the Prisoner's Dilemma (Komorita et al., 1991).
Part of the power and the popularity of the Prisoner's Dilemma metaphor is its applicability to the reward structures of many real-life settings.
For example, the Prisoner's Dilemma approach has been used to investigate decisions made about business-government
relationships, market
pricing, advertising, and university research (e.g., Aram, 1989; Corfman &
Lehmann, 1994). The popularity of the Prisoner's Dilemma is due also to its
relationship to formal game theory, a well-established
approach that can
be used to specify the optimal decisions that "rational" individuals will
choose (Friedman, 1990). We rely on the Prisoner's Dilemma metaphor and
the empirical results from past Prisoner's Dilemma research to develop a
conceptual framework of the factors affecting entrepreneur-venture capitalist cooperation.
Although we focus on the Prisoner's Dilemma in this article, past
research on entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships has applied
agency theory, concentrating on the issues of moral hazard and adverse
selection (e.g., Amit et al., 1990a). However, it appears that the agency
perspective is actually a subset of the broader explanation of these

relationships provided by the Prisoner's Dilemma approach. First, the
empirical research on venture capital suggests that the relationship between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists is not always a hierarchical
relationship between unequal parties where a principal seeks control of
an agent's behaviors (e.g., Amit et al., 1990a). For example, modeling entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships as an agency problem does
not incorporate the possibility of opportunistic behavior by the principal,
and past research has demonstrated that both entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists can choose defection strategies (e.g., Sahlman, 1990). True to
this distinction, the Prisoner's Dilemma framework incorporates the issues of uncertainty and goal conflict that underlie agency theory without
the restrictive assumption of a hierarchical relationship.
Also, the Prisoner's Dilemma framework addresses the social context
in which the parties are embedded (Granovetter, 1985). While the agency
perspective suggests that goal alignment between the two parties depends only on monitoring activity and ownership incentives (Sahlman,
1990), the Prisoner's Dilemma framework presented in this article explicitly models the social relationships that develop between parties which
increase the probability of cooperation and mutual gain. This development is critical because venture capital researchers emphasize the importance of dynamic transitions that occur as entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships develop (Sapienza, 1989). For example, cooperation
becomes more probable over time due to repeated interactions between
the two parties (Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996). The conceptual model presented in this article incorporates the dynamic process of cooperative
relationship building in a way that the more static agency theory approach can not.
The Prisoner's Dilemma and Entrepreneur-Venture Capitalist Relations
Given that cooperation is critical to the success of entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships, one might argue that both parties will
always cooperate. However, research indicates that cooperation is far
from ubiquitous (e.g., Sahlman, 1990). Furthermore, it appears that a Prisoner's Dilemma exists for both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as
they negotiate their ongoing business relationship. Following the classical payoff structure (T> R> P> S), both parties can experience higher shortterm payoffs for defection than for cooperation regardless of the other
party's actions, unless both parties defect (Dawes, 1980). Consistent with
past Prisoner's Dilemma research (e.g., Komorita et al., 1991), defection for
both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists refers to acting according to
immediate self-interest at the expense of mutual cooperation.
Mutual Defection Decisions. The motivation for entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists to procure short-term payoffs through defection is
linked inextricably to the uncertainty of new ventures. New ventures involve many inherently unpredictable factors including market, product,
and organizational uncertainty (i.e., whether an organization can be

<-----Page 7----->148

created to develop, produce, and sell a good or service profitably). Thus,
venture capitalists and entrepreneurs must make decisions based on expectations about future information (Arrow, 1974), such that cooperation
depends upon both parties' estimates of the venture's probability of success. Two factors may lead either party to estimate that defection is a
better strategy than cooperation at any point in time.
First, opportunity costs encourage defection for both entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists. Because both parties have limited resources, pursuit of a specific venture incurs the cost of not pursuing other opportunities as they arise. For example, if an entrepreneur becomes aware of a
new opportunity that appears to offer a high probability of success, the
costs of involvement with a venture may become too high, creating an
incentive to defect and exit the relationship. The defection incentive of
opportunity costs is especially high for venture capitalists who continuously evaluate new opportunities and seek to maximize financial returns.
Although defecting parties may reduce the probability of success for a
specific venture, they gain opportunities to promote other alternatives
and, therefore, receive rewards consistent with the Prisoner's Dilemma
framework.
Second, asymmetric information about the venture leads entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to make different subjective evaluations of
future venture performance. For example, the venture capitalist often has
better information about future financing of the venture and the entrepreneur often has better information about the future of the technology. The
information held by each party may lead to the formation of negative
expectations about the future. Since defection can provide a short term
payoff to the party which defects while the other cooperates, a party holding negative information about the future of the venture (and therefore
low expectations about its future) is motivated to defect. The above discussion of opportunity costs and asymmetric information applies to both
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists; next we consider each party's idiosyncratic responses to their inherent Prisoner's Dilemma.
Entrepreneurs' Defection Decisions. Although most entrepreneurs
probably recognize the importance of cooperating with venture capitalists, multiple defection temptations exist. First, as noted by Sapienza and
Korsgaard (in press), entrepreneurs have personal incentives to withhold
or alter critical information about the state of the business venture, even
though disclosing this information is necessary for mutual cooperation
with the venture capitalist. At the outset of their relationship with investors (i.e., early funding for product development), entrepreneurs may be
reluctant to give up technical details, even though it is clear that investors
must evaluate a venture's probability of success and growth potential in
order to decide on an appropriate level of future funding (Bowden, 1994).
Unfortunately, entrepreneurs who reveal information are not always protected by intellectual property laws, and they may make public knowledge of how to exploit a business opportunity without obtaining enough

<-----Page 8----->1997

Cable and Shane

149

resources to pursue that opportunity personally. Venture capitalists often
refuse to sign the standard non-disclosure agreements on the cover page
of entrepreneur's business plans, and venture capitalists routinely copy
and distribute plans that explicitly specify "not to be reproduced." Therefore, like the Prisoner's Dilemma, the entrepreneur may defect by withholding information about the technology to protect himself or herself
against an opportunistic venture capitalist. However, this defection impairs the venture capitalist who has less information available to evaluate the venture and make appropriate investment decisions at later
phases of the venture.
In addition to an unwillingness to divulge sensitive information, entrepreneurs also face a temptation to deliberately overstate the performance of their venture. Although the failure rate of new ventures is high,
entrepreneurs frequently over-project their venture's performance because venture capitalists' investments, while discounted, are directly related to these projections (Sahlman, 1990). Since entrepreneurs are motivated to acquire as much funding as possible (both for the venture and as
a positive signal to the market) and under the most favorable terms, the
short-term reward of a large initial investment creates a temptation to
manipulate information given to the venture capitalist.
Entrepreneurs also might be tempted to withhold or temper negative
information (e.g., bad news about test marketing) because it may affect
venture capitalists' decisions about continuing or increasing investments
in the venture (Bowden, 1994). Perhaps more important, venture capitalists
generally assume some control over ventures, such that reports of poor
performance could lead to a loss of power for the entrepreneur (Fried &
Hisrich, 1995). Poor performance also may spur the venture capitalist to
bring in professional management to replace the entrepreneur (MacMillan et al., 1989) or may lead to the dilution of the entrepreneur's stake in
the company if a new professional manager is given stock in the company. Alternatively, a poorly performing venture might need to raise new
funds. Under these circumstances, new stock will be issued at a lower
price than that at which it was originally issued. Since some venture
capital contracts protect venture capitalists against dilution of their stake
in the venture in such instances, the cost of this transaction may be born
by the entrepreneur (Hoffman & Blakely, 1987).
The cumulative impact of these outcomes makes information manipulation an attractive short-term strategy for the entrepreneur. However,
consistent with the Prisoner's Dilemma, entrepreneurs' short-term gains
from defection come at the expense of venture capitalists. In addition to
violating venture capitalists' rights to valid information about the venture, this form of defection ultimately damages the entrepreneur-venture
capitalist relationship as well as the venture's ultimate success if poor
decisions result from inaccurate information.
In addition to temptations to manipulate information, entrepreneurs
may defect both through their behaviors and their use of resources.

Entrepreneurial ventures demand a high degree of motivation and dedication. Although entrepreneurs prefer their ventures to succeed, a wide
variability exists between entrepreneurs' conscientiousness and devotion
towards the ventures' goals (e.g., Amit et al., 1990a). Promises of dedication and achievement that were made in earnest when securing an investment may become less attractive when the venture demands constant
attention, and the entrepreneur may begin to focus on other activities.
Alternatively, the entrepreneur might focus on the development of a venture's technology at the expense of financial performance to satisfy ego
needs (e.g., Steier & Greenwood, 1995). This form of defection, consistent
with the Prisoner's Dilemma, rewards entrepreneurs with personal gains
while penalizing venture capitalists and reducing the probability of a
successful relationship and venture.
Defection also may be a temptation when entrepreneurs are utilizing investors' capital. Often entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have
different views about the best use of resources; lavish company cars
and meals that entrepreneurs perceive as deserved may be viewed as
frivolous expenditures by venture capitalists. As researchers of venture
capitalist-entrepreneur
relationships have noted (e.g., Sahlman, 1990),
misuse of capital is very costly to venture capitalists but not necessarily
to entrepreneurs. Thus, entrepreneurs may appropriate rents from the use
of venture capitalists' funds, providing short term financial or psychic
benefits. However, misuse of capital detracts from venture capitalists'
returns on their investments and damages the venture capital relationship.
Clearly, entrepreneurs face a paradox between mutual cooperation
(by providing accurate information, time, and talent to venture capitalists)
and defection (by following short-term self interest at the expense of mutual cooperation). As noted by Amit, Glosten, & Muller, (1990b: 105) "The
entrepreneur is likely in many cases to choose actions that are consistent
with his own best interests but inconsistent with the venture capitalist's
interests." Next, we will consider the venture capitalist's position in the
entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationship.
Venture Capitalists' Defection Decisions. Like entrepreneurs, venture
capitalists are faced with many temptations to defect from a cooperative
relationship. Part of this temptation may stem from venture capital
arrangements for distributions to limited partners (Sahlman, 1990), which
usually specify that limited partners receive returns on their investments before venture capitalists secure a profit. Due to this arrangement,
venture capitalists may be tempted to harvest a venture's profits (i.e.,
to distribute earnings) rather than to reinvest in the venture's future
products and development (Sahlman, 1990). Unfortunately for the entrepreneur, whose assets are not as diversified as those of the venture capitalist, this decision limits the future long-term growth of the venture and
thus his or her personal returns. Furthermore, venture capitalists' consideration of limited partners may encourage them to defect by forcing the

<-----Page 10----->1997

Cable and Shane

151

entrepreneur to be overly concerned with short-term performance (GomezMejia, Balkin, & Welbourne, 1990).
Because the misuse of capital is more costly to venture capitalists
than entrepreneurs, and because venture capitalists have diversified risk
across multiple ventures, venture capitalists may be tempted to underinvest in ventures. As noted by Gorman and Sahlman, "Venture capitalists, for their part, generally seek to provide their entrepreneurs with only
the minimum of cash required" (1989: 238). Similarly, Bygrave and Timmons (1991) described venture capital-backed startups that yielded adequate, but not stunning, returns as "the living dead" because the venture
capitalists weren't willing to invest enough for the venture to shift into a
growth strategy. Thus, venture capitalists have an incentive to provide too
little capital for prototype development, product development, and marketing. Although this low investment strategy may benefit the (diversified) venture capitalist, it is detrimental to the (undiversified) entrepreneurs whose financial returns depend solely on the success of a single
venture.
Venture capitalists also have short-term incentives to defect in terms
of the time that they invest in specific ventures. As Sahlman noted, "venture investors visit each portfolio company an average of 19 times per year
and spend 100 hours in direct contact (on site or by phone) with the company. Since each venture capitalist ... is responsible for almost nine
investments and sits on five boards of directors, the allocation of time to
each portfolio company is considerable" (1990: 508). Thus, each nonfinancial investment (e.g., spending time on strategy formulation, introduction to clients and investment bankers, etc.) that venture capitalists
make in one venture can not be made in every venture in a portfolio, such
that venture capitalists necessarily must refrain from providing the best
inputs for each venture. However, as venture capitalists diversify risk by
diffusing time and tacit knowledge between multiple ventures, this can
be interpreted as a defection strategy by individual entrepreneurs who
have invested all of their resources in their specific venture. Consistent
with the Prisoner's Dilemma, venture capitalists incur short-term gains of
diversified time investments across more ventures by reducing the time
spent on any specific venture. However, the entrepreneur receives less
assistance from the venture capitalist, undermining the venture capital
relationship and reducing the value of the venture.
Increasing the Probability of a Cooperative Relationship
The previous discussion indicates that multiple and frequent temptations exist for both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to defect at the
expense of mutual cooperation. However, true to the Prisoner's Dilemma,
both parties can maximize their joint rewards through mutual cooperation. Thus, understanding the development of mutual cooperation between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs appears to be one of the most
pressing questions facing venture capital researchers. Accordingly, we

<-----Page 11----->152

now draw on past Prisoner's Dilemma research to develop a conceptual
model that examines the antecedents of cooperation between the two
parties. Consistent with the Prisoner's Dilemma, our model accommodates all four combinations of entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' cooperation and defection decisions, since the outcome depends on both
parties' decisions (see Figure 1). Although all four cells of the model are
interesting to venture capital research, we concentrate our discussion on
cooperative outcomes because as both Sapienza and Korsgaard (1996) and
Steier and Greenwood (1995) recently noted, cooperative relationships between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are necessary for the success
of venture capital-backed start-ups.
A central issue in past research on Prisoners' Dilemmas is how to
reach the cooperative solution, depicted as the R, R cell in Figure 1
(Axelrod, 1980). In the context of venture capital, the question becomes:
How should entrepreneurs and venture capitalists structure their relationships to maximize mutual cooperation and minimize defection? Decades
of past research on the Prisoners' Dilemma indicate that the predictors of
entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' cooperation strategies can be arranged as they are depicted in Figure 2. While past Prisoner's Dilemma
research has examined some variables that are not included in this model
(e.g., individual differences), we focused on those variables which are
theoretically relevant in the context of relationship building (Gabarro,
1979) and which can be managed by venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to promote long-term cooperation.
In the sections which follow, we rely on this model to generate propositions about the predictors of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist
relationships. Because many conditions that lead to cooperation do not
appear to have identical effects on entrepreneurs and venture capitalists,
and because the effects of these conditions are expected to change over
time, we also develop propositions concerning the differential effects of
the factors on entrepreneurs versus venture capitalists, and we incorporate stages of venture development into the model. Although it would be
interesting to propose specific venture stages that affect entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships, this article considers "early" and "later"
stages because little agreement exists in past research regarding the
delineation of venture stages (e.g., Bruno & Tyebjee, 1985; Bygrave & Timmons, 1991; Sahlman, 1990).
Time Pressure. Past Prisoner's Dilemma research indicates that the
greater the time pressure to reach an agreement, the more likely parties
are to reach a cooperative solution (Chertkoff & Esser, 1976). Time pressure refers to the degree to which a party feels increasing costs of time or
an impending deadline (Smith, 1987). Not surprisingly, time pressure encourages parties to formulate less ambitious demands (Pruitt & Drews,
1969), and leads to larger and more frequent concessions (Hamner, 1974).
Presumably, time pressure increases the salience of a cooperative solution (Pruitt & Drews, 1969).

In the context of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships, time
pressure acts as a catalyst for cooperation for a number of reasons. Often,
entrepreneurs begin ventures with very little or no capital (Evans & Jovanovic, 1989; Roberts, 1990), making it difficult to implement projects and
ideas. Entrepreneurs quickly risk depletion of their personal sources of
capital, which increases pressure to cooperate with venture capitalists
quickly. Also, many innovative entrepreneurial ventures are based on
time-sensitive information; original ideas and processes soon may be
replicated by other ventures (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, & Lyman, 1990).
Given the importance of first-mover advantages to subsequent business
success, the ability to create a prosperous venture often depends on the
speed of implementation.
Venture capitalists also face time pressure because their constituents
(e.g., limited partners) expect returns on their investments. Time is an
integral component of financial returns, and venture capitalists' performance is measured by total returns over a time period. Thus, when venture capitalists believe they have located a high-return investment, they
experience pressure to finish negotiations, move products to market, and
grow ventures to profitable stages. Similarly, increasing competition
among investors for new prospects puts pressure on venture capitalists to
initiate relationships quickly with the best prospective ventures (Bygrave
& Timmons, 1991).
Two qualifications emerge from the discussion concerning time pressure. First, the effects of time pressure on cooperation appear to be dynamic across the stages of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships,
such that time pressure is a greater impetus for cooperation at the start-up
stage of the relationship rather than later stages. This initial pressure is
due to both parties' motivations to be early movers with the venture's
product or service (Schoonhoven et al., 1990) and the initial financial and
social pressures to make the venture profitable. Second, although we
expect time pressure to make cooperation more likely for both parties,
entrepreneurs appear to be particularly susceptible to time constraints.
Entrepreneurs often have fewer funds available than venture capitalists,
and it is more likely that the entrepreneur's personal funds will be depleted before the venture generates significant cash flow (Evans & Jovanovic, 1989). Entrepreneurs also face greater time pressure because they
are undiversified. Their dependence on the performance of the venture for
compensation combined with the importance of first-mover advantages
places tremendous time pressure on entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists,
while clearly interested in receiving high returns quickly, are diversified
and, therefore, are in a greater position of power (Pfeffer, 1981) and are
expected to experience less time pressure to promote a particular venture
than entrepreneurs. Based on this discussion, we propose:
Proposition la: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-ven ture capitalist relationships increases with
each party's perceived time pressure.

Proposition lb: The effects of perceived time pressure on
cooperation are greatest during the early stages of the
entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationship.
Proposition lc: The effects of perceived time pressure on
cooperation are greater for entrepreneurs than venture
capitalists.
Payoff From Cooperation. Past Prisoner's Dilemma research indicates
that cooperation can be enhanced by increasing payoffs for cooperation
(Dawes, 1980). Elevated payoffs for cooperation encourage cooperative
strategies because they appeal to self-interest (Parkhe, 1993). When payoffs from cooperation are reduced, by contrast, the tendency to establish
cooperative solutions decreases dramatically, often causing parties to
cease cooperating altogether (Parkhe, 1993).
In the context of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships, we expect that the perceived potential gains from collaboration affects both
parties' cooperation strategies. Indeed, most venture capital transactions
occur because each party expects high returns from cooperation (Fried &
Hisrich, 1995; Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996). Thus, Sapienza (1989) suggested that cooperative interactions are more likely to occur between
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists if they both see a gain to cooperation. It is also important to note that gains to cooperation need not be
financial. Entrepreneurs perceive multiple nonfinancial gains to cooperating with venture capitalists including expert business advice (Fried &
Hisrich, 1995), signals of stability and legitimacy to the market (Sahlman,
1990), and exposure to the financial community (e.g., Bygrave & Timmons,
1992; Gupta and Sapienza, 1992). Similarly, venture capitalists have
claimed that learning about an industry may be a critical reason to invest
in a venture (Sapienza, 1989).
Although expected returns for cooperation should affect both parties' propensities to cooperate, two qualifications are relevant in the context of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships. First, each party's
perceptions of the financial payoff from cooperation probably depend on
the size of their venture investment relative to their total net worth. While
expected payoffs need not be financial, it generally is assumed that the
crux of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships is the financial returns from the venture (e.g., Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). Since compensation from the venture is directly linked to venture ownership, incentives to
cooperate should be affected by the percentage of total wealth that a
party has invested in the venture. Second, entrepreneurs generally have
a larger portion of their total personal wealth tied directly to the venture
(Evans & Jovanovic, 1989). This lack of diversification should make entrepreneurs more likely than venture capitalists to cooperate. Because venture capitalists investments are more diversified, they should perceive
lower payoffs (as a percentage of their total wealth) from cooperation on

<-----Page 15----->156

any given venture, and accordingly are expected to be less motivated to
cooperate. Based on this discussion, we propose:
Proposition 2a: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases with
each party's perceptions of the payoffs from cooperation.
Proposition 2b: Expected returns and the effect of expected returns on cooperation are related to each party's
venture ownership as a percentage of total net worth.
Proposition 2c: The effect of expected returns from cooperation are greater for entrepreneurs than for venture
capitalists.
Information. Past Prisoner's Dilemma research has indicated that cooperation is enhanced when information about the cooperative strategy of
one party can be gathered easily by the other (Abreu, Milgrom, & Pearce,
1991). Thus, mutual cooperation is more likely if the parties can secure
rapid and reliable recognition of each other's cooperative strategy
(Parkhe, 1993) and can ensure comprehension of requests for cooperation
(Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). Information transfer becomes especially critical
when the situation is noisy, because parties may misinterpret each other's
strategies (Axelrod & Dion, 1988). Consistent with past research, noise is
defined as random error in communication (Bendor, Kramer, & Stout, 1991):
For example, to the extent that non-cooperative actions are the result of
uncontrollable external forces, defection is less likely if these reasons can
be conveyed to the other party (Pruitt, 1981). Two factors that affect information transfer are communication and social relationships.
It is widely acknowledged that communication increases the likelihood of cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas (Dawes, McTarish, & Shaklee,
1977; Lindskold, Betz & Walters, 1986). Consistent with the preceding discussion of information accessibility, communication makes the actions
and strategies of the parties clearer (Nemeth, 1972). Communication also
humanizes and creates empathy for the other party, even if it is "small
talk" containing no relevant information (Zemel, 1989). Not surprisingly,
communication allows for discussion of the dilemma (Dawes, 1980) and
leads people to make behavioral commitments by indicating willingness
to cooperate (Lindskold et al., 1986). Conversely, unwillingness to communicate reduces cooperation, instead creating animosity, firmness, and the
tendency to give misinformation (Lindskold & Han, 1988).
Better, more frequent, and more open communications between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists appear to result in more cooperative
strategy choices (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992). For example, Roberts (1991)
found that some venture capitalists base their investment decisions on
the quality of communications they expect with an entrepreneur. Gupta
and Sapienza (1992) found that venture capitalists preferred to work with
entrepreneurs with whom they could communicate frequently and easily.

<-----Page 16----->1997

Cable and Shane

157

Sapienza and Gupta (1989) suggested that communication is important to
make venture capitalists understand new technologies and to keep them
from acting uncooperatively out of technical ignorance, which places high
communication demands on entrepreneurs. Similarly, research suggests
that frequent interactions between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists
ensure that any problems encountered when establishing relationships
are solved quickly (Sapienza, 1992). On the other hand, Bowden (1994)
found that entrepreneurs who fail to communicate the value of their ventures to venture capitalists were unable to acquire venture capitalist support.
The effects of communication on cooperation decisions do not appear
to be constant across the stages of a venture, however. For example,
Sapienza (1989) suggested that the greater the uncertainty surrounding a
venture, the more venture capitalists and entrepreneurs needed to communicate in order to cooperate. This finding is not surprising, because
uncertainty increases the probability that each party will have different
expectations about future technical, market, and organizational developments. Thus, high-quality and frequent communication appears to be particularly important during the early stages of the venture when uncertainty often leads to divergent expectations. Moreover, social relationship
theories suggest that information transfer is particularly important in the
formative stages of working relationships and that considerable information must be exchanged early in working relationships in order to develop
an interpersonal contract (e.g., Altman & Taylor, 1973; Gabarro, 1979).
Although frequent, high-quality communication is expected to induce
cooperation for both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, communication should have larger effects on venture capitalists' cooperation decisions than on entrepreneurs' cooperation decisions. Starting with their
initial negotiations with entrepreneurs, venture capitalists suffer from an
informational disadvantage. As suggested by Amit et al., (1990a: 1233),
"The entrepreneur's ability to combine tangible and intangible assets in
new ways and to deploy them to meet customer needs in a manner that
could not easily be imitated ... may be known to the entrepreneur, but
unknown to the venture capitalist." The potential for an adverse selection
problem makes investments particularly risky to venture capitalists.
Since entrepreneurs often are the only experts on the technology being
developed, venture capitalists must encourage communication to obtain
this information from the entrepreneur. Thus, Fredriksen, Klofsten, Landstrom, Olofsson, & Wahlbin (1990) found that venture capitalists often
promote communication by initiating and taking responsibility for sustaining dialogue with entrepreneurs. These authors also suggested that
venture capitalists use their role on the board of directors as a means of
encouraging communication. Based on the above discussion, we propose:
Proposition 3a: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases with the
quality and frequency of their communications.

<-----Page 17----->158

Proposition 3b: The effects of communication on cooperation are greatest during the early stages of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships.
Proposition 3c: The effects of communication on cooperation are greater for venture capitalists than for entrepreneurs.
It might be expected intuitively that more information of higher quality will be exchanged between people who know each other than between
strangers, and that those familiar with each other will be more likely to
cooperate than strangers. In fact, research confirms these expectations:
Social relationships between parties encourage cooperative solutions to
Prisoner's Dilemmas (Chertkoff & Esser, 1976). Researchers have demonstrated that cooperation is easier to develop and maintain if the other
party is viewed as someone likable, someone with common interests, and
someone with a common sense of solidarity (e.g., Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977).
Social relationships appear to increase cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas for several reasons. In terms of information transfer, social relationships between two parties alter communication patterns to facilitate
cooperation. Specifically, relational parties exchange more information
than nonrelational parties because they have greater trust in each other
(Ben-Yoav & Pruitt, 1984). Knowledge about an acquaintance's behavior in
settings other than the Prisoner's Dilemma are transferred, increasing
cooperative choices of behavior (Braver, 1975). Additionally, a positive
social relationship provides parties with reasons for helping each other
(Chertkoff & Esser, 1976).
In the context of venture capital, Bygrave and Timmons (1992) suggested
that entrepreneurs' pre-existing personal relationships with venture capitalists enhanced the development and sustaining of cooperative relationships.
Roberts (1991)found that networking with people who had prior relationships
with venture capitalists, as well as direct personal relationships with venture capitalists, enhanced the development of cooperative venture capital
relationships. Rea (1989) and Steier and Greenwood (1995) both found that
preexisting interpersonal relationships between entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists increased the probability of establishing a successful agreement.
Sapienza (1989) demonstrated that successful venture capitalists try to build
social relationships with entrepreneurs with whom they work, and Freear,
Sohl, & Wetzel (1990) have noted that some entrepreneurs believe it is beneficial to learn about the personality of the investor prior to making a deal.
As Sweeting (1991:619)wrote, "Venture capitalists ... were seeking to establish whether or not they could simply 'get along with' team members and
trust them. The benefits of this mutual understanding and trust were evident
even before the deal was made." Furthermore, MacMillan and Narasihmha
(1987)found that ventures were more likely to be supported and funded when
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists had a previous successful relationship.

Although we expect social relationships to promote cooperation for
both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, they should have greater impact on entrepreneurs' cooperation strategies than those of venture capitalists. First, venture capitalists may have reason to be resistant to close
interpersonal relationships with entrepreneurs (Sapienza, 1989). Since
venture capitalists often must replace entrepreneurs (Gorman & Sahlman,
1989), they may be wary of developing close ties which might affect their
ability to make future replacement decisions. Second, because venture
capitalists manage relationships with multiple entrepreneurs simultaneously, while an entrepreneur generally has only one relationship with
a venture capitalist, the relationship probably has less effect on venture
capitalists' decisions. Finally, venture capitalists often serve as personal
mentors and advisors to entrepreneurs (Bygrave & Timmons, 1992), presumably creating a greater sense of personal loyalty from the entrepreneur to the venture capitalist than vice versa. Given the primacy of this
relationship to the entrepreneur, his or her decision making is particularly
likely to be affected by previous social relationships (e.g., Stryker & Serpe,
1982). Thus we propose:
Proposition 4a: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases when
they share a previous positive social or business relationship.
Proposition 4b: The effect of previous positive social or
business relationships
on cooperation decisions is
greater for entrepreneurs than for venture capitalists.
Personal Similarity. One of the most established findings in social
psychology is that individuals are attracted to others perceived as similar
to themselves (e.g., Byrne, 1969). Theoretically, individuals are more attracted to similar others due to reduced cognitive dissonance, improved
communication, and increased predictability in social interactions (Jackson, Brett, Sessa, Cooper, Julin, & Peyronnin, 1991). Thus, we anticipate
that similarity between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will affect
their cooperative strategy decisions indirectly through the quality and
amount of information transferred (see Figure 2). Furthermore, individuals
often possess stereotypes about dissimilar others which affects their interpersonal relationships through active and passive self-fulfilling prophecies (Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1974).
Prisoner's Dilemma research has demonstrated that cooperation is
easier to develop and maintain if the other party is viewed as similar to
oneself (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). Apfelbaum (1974) found that goal congruence between parties led to cooperative game playing, and McNeel and
Reid (1975) found that similarity in attitudes enhances cooperation. Although there are a multitude of characteristics between people that might
be compared, we consider relational demography, work values congruence, and power equality due to the amount of Prisoner's Dilemma

<-----Page 19----->160

research that has accumulated on these topics and their relevancy to
organizational settings.
An important component of relationships in the context of organizational behavior is demographic similarity (Ferris & Judge, 1991). Individuals who are demographically similar to others (in terms of age, gender,
socio-economic status, race, etc.) enjoy better relationships and receive
greater organizational rewards than less-similar individuals (Jackson et
al., 1991). Theoretically, similar attributes and experiences enhance communication and liking, which in turn affect organizational attitudes and
outcomes such as role ambiguity in dyadic relationships (Tsui & O'Reilly,
1989) and supervisory performance ratings (Ferris & Judge, 1991). Relational demography appears especially important for entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists due to the closeness required in the working relationship and the need for clear, open communication (Sapienza, 1989). In fact,
Sapienza and Timmons (1989) used the analogy of marriage when describing entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' relationships. Sapienza and
Gupta (1989) found that cooperative relationships between entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists are enhanced by mechanisms in which the parties
select counterparts similar to themselves.
In addition to relational demography, another important aspect of
individuals in organizations that can be compared meaningfully is work
values (Chatman, 1989). Substantial evidence exists that individuals are
more attracted to, and are more likely to maintain relationships with,
people and environments with values similar to their own (Schneider,
1987). Accordingly, we expect work values similarity to affect entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' communication and willingness to cooperate. For example, to the extent that a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur both value fairness over achievement, and value honesty over
concern for others, they should be more likely to communicate effectively
and pursue a cooperative rather than defection strategy.
Some support for the positive effects of values congruence on cooperation decisions was provided by Bygrave and Timmons (1992), who suggested that personal chemistry is important to entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships. Similarly, Sapienza (1989) noted that in addition to
background experience and skills, perceived similarity or "fit" between
venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is weighted heavily by both parties.
Sapienza and Timmons (1989) suggested that pairings of entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists that see "eye-to-eye" have better relationships,
and Sapienza (1989) argued that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists
should select partners with whom they have convergent beliefs and values. As one venture capitalist stated, "I don't make investments in people
I wouldn't like socially....
The reason that you are doing the investment
is because you are attracted to the idea and the people" (Sapienza, 1989:
13). Sapienza (1992) explained that a similar mindset was important in
being able to respond quickly to the many crises that confront new
ventures. For example, entrepreneurs are more likely to receive timely

<-----Page 20----->1997

Cable and Shane

161

financial support, rather than derisive debate, if they have selected likeminded venture capitalists. Thus, Sapienza and Gupta (1989) suggested
that when there is large divergence between entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists, often the venture capitalist is removed from the board or the
entrepreneur is replaced as CEO.
A final type of interpersonal similarity that is relevant to parties in a
Prisoner's Dilemma is relative power. Past Prisoner's Dilemma research
indicates that the more equal the power balance between the two parties,
the more likely they are to cooperate (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). When power
is imbalanced, the party with greater power is less likely to cooperate
because he or she usually believes that he or she can force the other party
to meet his or her demands (Rubin & Brown, 1975). By contrast, cooperation
is facilitated when power is balanced because both parties perceive that
the behavior of the other cannot be altered through force (Pruitt & Kimmel,
1977).
In the context of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships, there
appears to be substantial variance in the amount of power held by the
parties at different stages of the relationship. Furthermore, because each
party must decide whether or not to cooperate based on their perceptions,
power similarity is defined here as perceived equality of power (relative
to the other party). Thus, it is possible that an entrepreneur and a venture
capitalist do not agree on their level of power similarity and that both
parties make decisions based on their individual views. However, there
appear to be situations when each party has high power relative to the
other. For entrepreneurs, relative power is increased to the extent that
their product expertise is idiosyncratic (Amit et al., 1990a), or if their expertise in an industry in which venture capitalists are interested in investing is substantial (Hustedde & Pulver, 1992). Entrepreneurs' relative
power also may be affected by their track records for successfully developing and managing new businesses (Amit et al., 1990a), if they possess
substantial personal capital relative to the funds needed to develop the
venture (Fried & Hisrich, 1995), or if multiple investment sources are available (Bygrave & Timmons, 1991). Conversely, a venture capitalist may
have a track record of poor financial returns or a lack of available deals,
diminishing their power relative to the entrepreneur (Bygrave & Timmons,
1991). Finally, as a venture becomes successful, an entrepreneur may renegotiate the terms of the agreement, removing such conditions (e.g. a
forfeiture provision) which limit his or her power (Hoffman & Blakey, 1987).
Other situations appear to increase venture capitalists' relative
power. Young ventures commonly "burn up" cash because they can not
yet generate more revenues than costs (Hoffman & Blakey, 1987), and
venture capitalists have access to capital that is needed by cash-poor
entrepreneurs. Also, before the desirability of a venture's product or service has been demonstrated, the legitimating role of the venture capitalist
often is very important to the success of the venture (Hoffman & Blakey,
1987). Venture capitalists also may increase their relative power if they

<-----Page 21----->162

have relationships with investment bankers or potential customers (Steier
& Greenwood, 1995) or if they control a majority of the seats on the board
of directors (Fried & Hisrich, 1995). In some situations, venture capitalists
may have greater knowledge than the entrepreneur about the industry in
which the firm is operating (Hustedde & Pulver, 1992), and may even be
involved in the active management of the company (Sahlman, 1990), increasing their power relative to the entrepreneur.
To the extent that power is similar between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, cooperation is more likely because the behavior of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and the provisions of the venture capital
agreement, are focused on the establishment of a long-term cooperative
relationship rather than on attempts to achieve advantages at the expense of the other party (Hoffman & Blakey, 1987; Sahlman, 1990). Based on
the above discussion, we propose:
Proposition 5: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases as (a) demographic similarity, (b) work values congruence, and
(c) perceived power equality between entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists increase.
Transaction Procedures. Past Prisoner's Dilemma research has revealed several procedures that can be implemented to increase the probability of a cooperative solution. We consider these transaction procedures next.
When two parties in a Prisoners' Dilemma do not trust each other,
cooperation is difficult to achieve due to potential losses if one party
cooperates while the other does not (Keren & Raub, 1993). One way to
generate initial cooperation in the absence of trust is to post bonds, or
down payments that are sacrificed upon defection. As Keren and Raub
(1993) suggested, bond posting signals that a party is committed to a
cooperative solution in the Prisoners' Dilemma by making defection
costly.
As noted by Hoffman and Blakey (1987) and Sahlman (1990), both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists may post bonds to signal interest in
developing a long-term relationship, thus promoting mutual cooperation.
For example, entrepreneurs may offer venture capitalists antidilution provisions, which protect venture capitalists' investments if the venture performs poorly. Entrepreneurs also may extend forfeiture provisions, which
require entrepreneurs to relinquish shares if performance is below a targeted level (Hoffman & Blakey, 1987). Non-compete clauses represent another form of posted bond, because they preclude entrepreneurs from
working in the same industry if they abandon the venture (Sahlman, 1990).
Vesting provisions, by which the entrepreneur's stock ownership increases over a period of years with the company, is another form of bond.
On the part of venture capitalists, an offer of initial seed money, often
preceding collection of substantial information about the venture, may be

<-----Page 22----->1997

Cable and Shane

163

interpreted correctly as a bond by entrepreneurs (Sahlman, 1990). Another
type of bond posted by venture capitalists is an employment contract
(Hoffman & Blakey, 1987), which commits them to employing an entrepreneur for a specified period of time.
Although researchers suggest that bond posting affects cooperation
decisions, the relationship does not appear to be constant across the
stages of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships. Specifically, bond
posting should have its greatest effect on entrepreneurs' and venture
capitalists' cooperation decisions in the earlier stages of their relationships. Similar to the previous discussion of communication, there is less
opportunity for partners to develop expectations about each other based
on previous actions early in the relationship, making posted bonds particularly informative in the initial stages of the venture. Also, consistent
with Altman & Taylor's (1973) and Gabarro's (1979) models of relationship
building, there is considerable less trust between partners during the
orientation and exploration phases of working relationships. During later
stages an interpersonal contract has been established, and there is
greater interpersonal influence (Gabarro, 1979). Then cooperation decisions may be based on expectations derived from a history of past behavior, making cooperation less dependent on bond posting. In fact, during the later stages of a venture, bond posting may even be detrimental to
cooperation to the extent that it erodes trust. Thus, we propose:
Proposition 6a: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases if bonds
are posted by the parties.
Proposition 6b: The effects of bond posting on cooperation are greatest during the early stages of the entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationship.
The longer people interact in a Prisoner's Dilemma, the more likely
they are to cooperate (Rapoport & Chammah, 1965). As discussed previously, repeated interactions between parties provides knowledge about
the strategies that each player adopts, and thus, allows players to signal
consistent cooperation (Parkhe, 1993). Players in a Prisoner's Dilemma
also develop reputations for their actions over time, a process that encourages cooperative strategies because as people gain reputations for
cooperation, the risk of cooperating with them declines (Parkhe, 1993).
Finally, repeated interactions enhance cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas because each party knows that he or she cannot successfully take
advantage of the other due to expectations of future interactions and
reciprocation (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977). Thus, longer time horizons from multiple game stages increase the net present value of a cooperative strategy
relative to the net present value of a defection strategy (Andreoni & Miller,
1993).
Like the Prisoner's Dilemma, relationships between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs generally are not one-shot interactions. Instead,

<-----Page 23----->164

Academy of Management Review

entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' decisions about cooperation usually are made, considered, and revised in a series of stages starting with
initial seed investments and ending with the cash-out, or exit stage (Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza, 1992). At each of these periods, both entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists reevaluate their positions and decide upon a cooperation or defection strategy (Bowden, 1994). Thus, to the extent that
venture capitalists and entrepreneurs advocate multiple stages by agreeing to base capital payout on specific performance goals, they should
increase the probability of cooperation. Consistent with the Prisoner's
Dilemma, the unknown longevity of the business relationship and the
unknown future strategy of one's counterpart, ensure that entrepreneurs'
and venture capitalists' cooperation-defection decisions during one stage
have implications for their future relationship and for their relationships
with others (Sahlman, 1990). Accordingly, venture capital research indicates that repeated interactions between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists encourages cooperation (Bowden, 1994). Fiet (1995) suggested a
Baysian learning process between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists,
where each party's actions and observations over time let the true picture
develop and allow inconsistencies to explain themselves. Sahlman (1990:
513) noted that "the multiperiod nature of the [venture capital] game creates strong incentives to perform well and to forego opportunistic behavior." The above discussion leads to the seventh proposition:
Proposition 7: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases when
capital payouts are administered and venture performance is evaluated in multiple stages.
Researchers have argued that a strategy of generosity encourages
cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas (Axelrod, 1984). Generosity is a strategy that does not retaliate against each of the other player's defections
and may be valuable because it can encourage a return to cooperation if
either party defects (Wu & Axelrod, 1995). The positive effects of generosity
may be interpreted through equity theory, which implies that a generous
act creates a condition of "overpayment" for a defecting party, who can
restore equity and eliminate negative feelings by returning to cooperation.
Generosity may be effective because the failure to be generous is
costly. If one is not generous and one's counterpart reciprocates, then a
non-cooperative, sub-optimal solution will result (Pruitt, 1971). Moreover,
if one is not generous, defections from cooperation are difficult to rectify
(Axelrod, 1984). Thus, research has shown that a strategy of "quick to
retaliate and slow to cooperate" evokes the lowest level of cooperation
(Komorita et al., 1991). Generosity is particularly effective for increasing
cooperation when noise makes it difficult to identify the strategies of the
players, because accidental defections put cooperative strategies at risk
(Molander, 1985). By overemphasizing cooperation and underemphasizing

<-----Page 24----->1997

Cable and Shane

165

defection, generosity protects cooperation against accidental defection
(Axelrod & Dion, 1988).
Generosity appears to be especially relevant in the context of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships because noise is likely to be
high. Behavior in formative relationships often is equivocal and one party's interpretation of another party's behavior as cooperation versus
defection may be unpredictable, leaving substantial room for misinterpretation and misguided reciprocation (Weick, 1979). For example, communications with other ventures, new equipment purchases, and extended business trips may be interpreted by the other party as beneficial
or detrimental to the venture, especially when the parties have not developed a history of actions and interactions on which to base interpretations.
Not surprisingly, research has confirmed that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can encourage cooperation by engaging in generous behavior. Bowden (1994) argued that venture capitalists who demand a
smaller portion of the equity in a business are more likely to procure
entrepreneurs to work with them. Similarly, Hustedde and Pulver found
that "the higher the percentage of equity entrepreneurs are willing to
surrender to outside venture capitalists, the more likely they are to be
successful in acquiring funding" (1992: 367). Sapienza (1989) quoted several venture capitalists explaining that they enhanced the performance of
their ventures by showing compassion and understanding entrepreneurs'
needs to have certain conditions met.
It appears that the effects of generosity should be dynamic across the
stages of entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships, having a larger
effect on cooperation decisions during the earlier stages of the relationship when uncertainty, and thus noise, is high. In the start-up stage of a
venture, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists must interpret each other's
behaviors as cooperation or defection. What an entrepreneur may view as
cooperation, a venture capitalist may interpret as defection (e.g., a company car purchase, business trips). Similar to the discussion of bond posting, generous behaviors intended to facilitate cooperation in the midst of
uncertainty and noise are probably most effective before a series of past
behaviors have created trust between partners (Altman and Taylor, 1973;
Gabarro, 1979; Wu and Axelrod, 1995). Based on this discussion, we propose:
Proposition 8a: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases with the
generosity shown by one party toward the other.
Proposition 8b: The effects of generosity on cooperation
are greatest during the early stages of the entrepreneurventure capitalist relationship.
Past research indicates that cooperation can be enhanced in Prisoner's Dilemmas by increasing penalties for defection (Chertkoff & Esser,

<-----Page 25----->166

Review

1976). Non-cooperation penalties can occur directly, through each party's
ability to punish others for non-cooperation (Pruitt, 1981), or indirectly,
through norms of morality which lead to collective punishment of noncooperators (e.g., ostracism) (Dawes, 1980). Furthermore, penalties for non-cooperation need not be imposed consistently to be effective (Schuessler,
1989).
Cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can be
encouraged through a number of non-cooperation penalties. From a venture capitalist perspective, entrepreneurs' misuse of venture capital may
be penalized by diluting their equity share at an increasingly punitive
rate (Sahlman, 1990), while venture capitalists may impose antidilution
provisions to preclude the diminution of their own stake (Hoffman &
Blakey, 1987). Also, venture capitalists often have the ability to fire the
entrepreneur as CEO of the company and invoke a non-compete clause to
prevent the entrepreneur from starting another venture in the same industry (Barney, Busenitz, Fiet, & Moesel, 1994; Hoffman & Blakey, 1987). A
third and related sanction is a stock repurchase agreement which allows
a venture capitalist to purchase a departing entrepreneur's shares at
below-market prices (Sahlman, 1990). Past research also indicates that
compensation structures, such as entrepreneurs drawing a below-market
salary but keeping greater venture ownership, effectively penalize noncooperative behavior and promote cooperation (Sahlman, 1990). Finally,
collective punishment of defecting entrepreneurs, such as ostracism, may
occur because an entrepreneur's reputation will be degraded if his or her
funding has been discontinued.
Although the Prisoner's Dilemma framework implies that both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists may use transaction procedures to penalize the other party's non-cooperative behaviors, research indicates
that entrepreneurs have fewer penalties available to them, and that they
rarely use those that are available (Sahlman, 1990). However, several penalties appear to exist. As Hoffman and Blakey (1987) noted, entrepreneurs
can promote cooperation by insisting on an employment contract of a
certain duration to make it more difficult for the venture capitalist to
terminate him or her. Entrepreneurs also may rely on the collective punishment of the market by damaging a non-cooperative venture capitalist's reputation. In addition to making it difficult for these venture
capitalists to attract the best entrepreneurial ventures in the future, this
degrades the venture capitalist's reputation with limited partners (Sahlman, 1990). Based on this discussion, we propose:
Proposition 9a: The probability of cooperative entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships increases when
penalties against non-cooperative behavior are instituted.
Proposition 9b: Venture capitalists have more penalties
against non-cooperative behavior at their disposal, and

<-----Page 26----->Cable and Shane

are more likely to promote cooperation through penalties than are entrepreneurs.
Predicted Effects. Table 1 summarizes the propositions presented in
this article, highlighting the predictions that diverge between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. This table also demonstrates the dynamic
nature of the relationships as entrepreneurs and venture capitalists move
from the start-up stage to later stages of a venture. We next discuss the
implications of the model and propositions for researchers, practicing
entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists.
IMPLICATIONS
Many organizational researchers have assumed that unfettered competition between self-interested individuals enhances individual benefits and societal value (e.g., Williamson, 1975). Other scholars (e.g.,
Granovetter, 1985) have discussed situations in which mutual cooperation
is better for all participants than the tendency for individuals to maximize
short-term individual self-interest. The present article we indicate that
entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships are closer to the intellectual
tradition of Granovetter (1985) than Williamson (1975) because cooperative
solutions enhance the welfare of both parties. Accordingly, in this article
we argue that agency theory may not be the most appropriate model
with which to investigate entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships.
Most previous research on entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships
has been "undersocialized" in Granovetter's (1985) terms, relying on the

assumptions that both parties are economically "rational" and will always engage in short-term opportunistic behavior. Furthermore, modeling venture capital relationships as a principal-agent problem appears
unduly restrictive given the potential for opportunistic, non-cooperative
actions by venture capitalists as well as entrepreneurs. For example,
while the agency approach focuses on venture capitalists' adverse selection problem when evaluating entrepreneurs, an adverse selection problem also exists for entrepreneurs since they must locate venture capitalists who can provide complementary managerial expertise, access to relevant networks, and legitimacy (Amit, Glosten, & Muller, 1993).
Based on the inherent reward structure and the long-term benefits of
mutual cooperation, we submit that entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships are modeled more effectively as a Prisoner's Dilemma rather
than as a principal-agent problem. Furthermore, the Prisoner's Dilemma
approach suggests activities and procedures that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can enact to promote long-term cooperative relationships,
despite short-term personal gains from opportunistic defection. Thus, the
research-based framework presented here provides a conceptual model
to guide future venture capital research and to help integrate past findings.
Implications for Research
We adapted the Prisoner's Dilemma framework to the venture capital
context in response to repeated calls for a conceptual model of entrepreneurs' and investors' long-term relationships (e.g., Sapienza & Korsgaard,
1996; Steier & Greenwood, 1995). Consistent with these researchers' suggestions, this article emphasizes the factors that promote mutual cooperation. However, it is critical to remember that although cooperation is
necessary for the ultimate success of venture capital-backed start-ups, it
is not synonymous with success, nor does entrepreneur-venture capitalist
cooperation guarantee the prosperity of a start-up. Despite the benefits of
cooperative behavior, a multitude of factors can lead to a venture's failure
(e.g., poor products and services, lack of a market, etc.).
Although the model presented herein is grounded theoretically and
empirically in past research, there are several other areas for future research to develop. First, we considered only the direct effects of the variables presented in Figure 2. It remains for future researchers to identify
and examine possible interactive effects between the variables. For example, the possibility that higher-quality transaction procedures may reduce the need for information transfer is intuitively appealing, as is the
possibility that penalties for non-cooperative behavior will be implemented more often and more successfully when a party's relative power is
high. Because no theoretical or empirical research foundation currently
exists to develop these interactive effects, however, they should receive
comprehensive consideration in future research.
It also should be noted that we examined only the entrepreneur-

<-----Page 28----->1997

Cable and Shane

169

venture capitalist relationship as a two-person Prisoner's Dilemma. Consistent with Bowden (1994), this approach was taken to develop a core
theoretical foundation to help model the basic decisions made by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. However, the two-person Prisoner's Dilemma between a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur is embedded in
a larger n-person Prisoner's Dilemma game of all entrepreneurs and all
venture capitalists. N-person Prisoner's Dilemmas may have significant
merit in explaining the general process of new venture formation, and it
even may be possible to incorporate other actors (e.g., suppliers) into
future models. Therefore, it may be possible for future researchers to develop the Prisoner's Dilemma framework as a theoretical framework to
explain the process of new firm formation in an environment of egoistic
actors, each possessing some of the resources necessary for new firm
formation.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the model presented in
this article is the subjectivity of the variables. For example, time pressure
and payoff to cooperation are perceptual: A venture capitalist may perceive time pressure that an entrepreneur or another venture capitalist
may not perceive to be present in a venture (due to knowledge about the
market, for example). Similarly, the interpretation of another party's actions as a cooperative versus a defection strategy may vary depending on
who is making the interpretation (e.g., Bendor et al., 1991). The subjective
nature of key factors in the Prisoner's Dilemma model provides focus for
future research on particular entrepreneur-venture capitalist dyads as the
unit of analysis rather than the general venture capital negotiation process. Furthermore, due to the time-sensitive
nature of entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships, future research should be longitudinal to
capture the dynamic nature of the relationship depicted in Table 1. Accordingly, survival analysis models may provide a valuable methodology
to study entrepreneur-venture capitalist relationships. Due to the rationalization processes inherent in responses to retrospective surveys, however, it appears that these data must be collected in real time at different
stages of the relationship.
In fact, the subjectivity of the variables discussed in this article also
has interesting implications that reflect back upon the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma framework. Consistent with past research, in the present
article we indicate that adapting the Prisoner's Dilemma to real-world
settings necessarily increases the noise and miscommunication inherent
in the game, and places a greater emphasis on the process of behavior
interpretation (e.g., Wu & Axelrod, 1995). However, the application of the
Prisoner's Dilemma framework to the specific context of entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships also has implications about the Prisoner's
Dilemma that have not been discussed in past research.
In past real-world applications of the Prisoner's Dilemma, "objective"
payoff matrices could be constructed based on the financial outcomes of
past decisions, events, and consumer reactions (e.g., Corfman & Lehmann,

<-----Page 29----->170

Academy of Management Review

January

1994). However, the venture capital context indicates that in uncertain
situations such as the creation of a new product or service for a new
market, objective payoff matrices cannot be formulated. Rather, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists must create payoff expectations through the
processes of social construction (Weick, 1979) and the use of decisions
making heuristics (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986). Although the payoff structure conforms to that of the Prisoner's Dilemma (T> R> P> S), the magnitude of the payoffs are socially constructed. Thus, entrepreneurs' and
venture capitalists' cooperation versus defection decisions may be subject to the biases inherent to decision making under uncertainty (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1986) and are difficult to quantify objectively.
Implications for Practice
The incipient nature of research on venture capitalist-entrepreneur
relationships, and on the link between cooperative relationships and venture success, precludes a comprehensive discussion of the implications of
this article for practice; however, some degree of cooperation represents a
necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the ultimate success of a venture capital-backed venture. Clearly, some of the factors in Figure 2 cannot be manipulated easily by entrepreneurs or venture capitalists to increase the likelihood of cooperation. For example, neither party can be
expected to decrease the amount of time before the venture loses value, or
increase demographic similarity after the relationship begins. On the
other hand, most of the variables suggested by past Prisoner's Dilemma
research have direct implications for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as they negotiate their relationships, particularly because many of
the variables are perceptual. Although the need for entrepreneurs to understand the factors affecting successful cooperation with venture capitalists has been widely recognized (e.g., Hoffman & Blakey, 1987), it also is
becoming increasingly important for venture capitalists to understand
these factors as competition for good investments increases rapidly
(Gupta & Sapienza, 1992).
The model presented in this article suggests that both parties should
increase the level and quality of information transfer. From an entrepreneur's perspective, this indicates that the personal gain from information
omission or inflation are short-term and should not be pursued, because
it will not contribute to mutual cooperation and may hinder ultimate success of the venture capital relationship. From the venture capitalist perspective, the model indicates that greater personal contact with a venture
and the entrepreneur will enhance information transfer and therefore will
contribute to the ultimate success of the relationship (Sahlman, 1990).
Venture capital researchers have indicated a large disparity in the amount
of time that venture capitalists spend working with their portfolio ventures (e.g., MacMillan & Narasimha, 1987). Although it is not surprising
that many venture capitalists try to minimize their personal interactions
with entrepreneurs in favor of low-contact, fast-payoff investments, the

<-----Page 30----->1997

Cable and Shane

171

long-term value of frequent interactions was suggested by Sapienza (1992)
who found that venture capitalists with frequent, open communications
with entrepreneurs were more successful than other venture capitalists.
Additionally, although a venture capitalist may not be able to affect
the earnings of a venture directly, he or she can affect the payoff to cooperation as perceived by the entrepreneur, and thus increase the probability of a cooperative relationship. For example, one factor that can be
influenced is the percentage of company ownership that the entrepreneur
retains. Moreover, according to many entrepreneurs, the most important
resources that a venture capitalist brings to the relationship are noneconomic, including networks with the financial community, business advice, and moral support (Fried & Hisrich, 1995). Thus, by investing more
personal time in interactions with entrepreneurs, venture capitalists can
increase cooperation by increasing the perceived payoff to the entrepreneur.
The model presented in this article also suggests that entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships may be enhanced if they have a relational as well as an transactional component. In fact, it appears that the
personal relationships formed between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists serve as a signal to both parties about the level and quality of
information transfer, and the ultimate success of the business relationship (Granovetter, 1985). In addition to enhancing information exchange,
social relationships foster trust and generosity, both of which increase the
probability of a cooperative solution to Prisoner's Dilemmas (Dawes,
1980), especially when considerable noise exists (Wu & Axelrod, 1995).
Although many entrepreneurs and venture capitalists realize the importance of social relationships (Fried & Hisrich, 1995), evidence also exists
that some parties try to maintain strict business formality (Sapienza, 1989).
We suggest that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists with relational
associations will be more likely to achieve long-term cooperation.
The Prisoner's Dilemma model also implies that both entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists should seek to implement transaction procedures
that promote mutual cooperation. Thus, to the extent that the parties can
establish
early bilateral bonding mechanisms,
penalties
for noncooperative behavior, and staged performance evaluations and distributions of capital, long-term cooperation is more likely. Similarly, if entrepreneurs and venture capitalists engage in generous behaviors during
contract negotiations and other early business interactions, both parties
can expect increased mutual cooperation rather than defection for shortterm personal gain.
A final implication for practice concerns the importance of external
governing bodies to the effectiveness of entrepreneur-venture capitalist
relationships. Traditionally, scholars have argued that self-induced cooperation between egoistic actors is unstable, and that higher organizational entities, such as governmental agencies, must be established (e.g.,
Schuessler, 1989). In stark contrast to these suggestions, we are aligned

<-----Page 31----->172

with past Prisoner's Dilemma research which indicates that cooperation
is sustainable without the establishment of a higher authority. These
implications are especially important in the context of a venture capital
industry that is becoming increasingly international (Bygrave & Timmons,
1992), and, therefore, is no longer governed by a single national authority.
The fact that sustainable cooperative relationships between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can be developed in the absence of a single
legal system suggests that the venture capital industry can become international without drastically increasing the level of inherent risk in the
relationships and without bringing about a collapse of the cooperative
solutions upon which the industry is founded.
