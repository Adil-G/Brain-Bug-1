Abstract
This paper examines the influence of economic institutions upon venture
capitalists’ (VCs) decision policies. We conducted policy-capturing experiments
on 119 VCs across three countries, representing distinct economic institutions
(US, mature market economy; South Korea, emerging economy; and China,
transitional economy). Results show that VCs in rules-based market economies
(US) rely upon market information to a greater extent than VCs in emerging
economies (Korea), and Chinese VCs (transitional economy) weight human
capital factors more heavily than either US or Korean VCs. Findings suggest
that, although professional institutions may dictate which information
is included in VC decision policies, the extent to which that information is
emphasized is determined partly by the economic institution in which the
decision-maker operates.

Introduction
The way that managers understand their environments and solve
problems depends, in part, on the economic institutions in which
they are embedded. Concerned with scarcity and hence competition for resources (North, 2005: 1), economic institutions represent
the ‘rules of the game’ that provide incentives and reduce
uncertainties in assessing the costs of transacting, such as the costs
of protecting rights and policing and enforcing agreements (North,
1990). As economies become increasingly complex, the need for
economic institutions to evolve from relationship-based systems
that prefer personal exchanges to rules-based systems that favor
impersonal arm’s length transactions has become more acute. For
example, as property rights are created and enforced, there is a
shift in the costs of transacting that favors rules-based systems
over relationship-based systems, owing to a comparative advantage
of scale that accompanies the impersonal exchange of rules-based
systems (World Bank, 2002). As a result, many transitional
economies have abandoned the central planning of communism
through shock therapies (e.g., Russia and Poland). Other states,
typically referred to as emerging economies, have sought to
develop their economies through a more gradual movement

toward increasingly market-based policies (e.g.,
South Korea and Thailand).
Because these various economic institutions
structure the incentives of human exchange differently, one might expect their members to use
different information when formulating their decisions. However, research on venture capital has
found that venture capitalists (VCs) around the
world use similar decision factors (Knight, 1994;
Rah et al., 1994). At first, this appears to imply that
economic institutions play a purely passive role in
constraining the choices of economic actors.
Further consideration, however, suggests that the
use of similar decision factors does not necessarily
imply that decision-makers in general, and VCs in
particular, rely upon information in the same way.
For example, American and Korean VCs may agree
that information about the market and human
capital should be considered, but Americans may
emphasize market information whereas Koreans
pay relatively more attention to information about
the entrepreneur, or vice versa.
The purpose of this paper is to determine whether
such differences in decision policies exist (i.e.,
differences in the use of, and/or emphasis on, certain
decision factors in making an assessment or judgment) and, if so, whether they can be explained by
differences in the political-economic institutions of
different countries. We expect that investment
decisions will be institutionally dependent, so that
VCs from mature market economies will give more
weight to market-oriented information whereas VCs
from emerging or transitional economies will be
more likely to favor human capital information that
suggests the entrepreneur is trustworthy and capable. We reason that the weak enforcement of
property rights, typifying many relationship-based
economies, enhances the importance of transaction
costs in VC evaluations of venture investment
opportunities. As a result, aspects of human capital
can be a first proxy of an entrepreneur’s access to
networks and his or her social influence, given that
experience and reputation are indicative of the
entrepreneur’s capabilities and trustworthiness
(McKnight et al., 1998; Gill et al., 2005) and firms
seek to partner with such well-regarded individuals
and organizations (Powell, 1990; Uzzi, 1997; Das
and Teng, 1998). In contrast, in a society characterized by strong property rights enforcement, the
importance of transaction costs may pale in comparison with concerns about transformation costs.
Consequently, VCs in rules-based systems may be
expected to emphasize market information relative

Journal of International Business Studies

to human capital information, viewing the latter as
necessary but insufficient to the creation and
realization of value.
To test our hypotheses, we conducted policycapturing experiments on 119 VCs across three
countries. Because Bruton et al. (1999) suggest that
VC firms reflect local institutional forces, we
sampled VCs from countries in three distinct
economic institutions (US, mature market economy;
South Korea, emerging economy; and China,
transition economy). Specifically, we assume that
VCs in the US operate within an economy that
possesses rules-based institutions, as opposed to
VCs in Korea and China, who operate within
economies that are characterized by relatively more
relationship-based institutions. In doing so, we
make two important contributions.
First, venture capital represents an important
source of funds for managers to grow their firms,
and is a key driver of economic growth (Reynolds
et al., 2004); understanding VCs’ decision policies is
a step towards explaining why some firms receive
venture capital and why others do not and by
extension the nature of an economy’s growth. The
VC literature implies that VCs from different
countries use the same criteria to assess the value
of potential portfolio companies (Knight, 1994; Rah
et al., 1994). Although we acknowledge that VCs are
relatively homogeneous in the criteria they use,
they are likely to be heterogeneous in the way that
they use these criteria as part of their decision
policy. Based on our model derived from institutional theory, we expect that institutional influences of a country explain, in part, heterogeneity in
VCs’ decision policies.
Second, institutional theory offers an appealing
explanation for differences in individuals’ behaviors across countries, but remains a challenging
theory to test empirically (Scott, 2001: 214). Although this study faces some of these challenges,
many are mitigated by the use of an experiment
that holds constant potentially confounding attributes of the environment, and captures the way
that individuals make decisions. Capturing the way
that people make decisions is important in a test
of institutional theory, because North (1990: 107)
suggests that ‘[w]e cannot see, feel, touch, or even
measure institutions; they are constructs of the
human mind.’ Experiments, and particularly policy
capturing, represent a promising step towards
testing models derived from institutional theory.
This article proceeds as follows. First, we provide
a brief overview of the VC industry in each of

<-----Page 2----->Venture capitalists’ decision policies across three countries

693

the countries under study. Next, we examine how
rules-based institutions in a mature economy may
influence decisions differently from relationshipbased institutions in an emerging country and in a
transitional country. Then, we describe our research
method and detail the results. Finally, we discuss
the results and offer some concluding comments.

Venture capital by country
United States venture capital industry
The US venture capital industry is the largest
and oldest. Emerging after World War II, the
first modern-day venture capital company was
American Research and Development Corporation
(Bygrave and Timmons, 1992). The industry
remained relatively small until the 1980s: in 1982
the industry had committed over $1 billion to
portfolio companies (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992).
The industry experienced rapid growth in the 1990s,
culminating in the dot-com frenzy of 1998–2000,
where VC investments ‘topped out’ at over $100
billion invested in over 5000 different portfolio
companies in 2000 (Neck et al., 2003). Although
the industry is currently a fraction of its peak ($20
billion in 2005), it is still an important driver of the
entrepreneurial sector in the US (Neck et al., 2003).
South Korean venture capital industry
The South Korean venture capital industry can be
characterized by two types of venture capital firm:
new-tech business financing companies, and startup financing companies (Rah et al., 1994). In 1984
there were only four venture capital firms in total
(Rah et al., 1994), but by the end of 2000 there were
four new-tech business financing companies and
148 start-up financing companies (KVCA, 2003).
Generally similar in their basic functions, start-up
financing companies focus on equity investment,
whereas new-tech business financing companies
focus primarily on loans. The total investment by
VCs and their managing funds has grown by almost
1000% since 1990, to US$5.8 billion at the end
of 2000 (KVCA, 2003). Combined with the funds
pooled by financial institutions and conglomerates
including VCs, the total capital available for venture investment exceeds US$8.5 billion (KVCA,
2003). Activity dropped in 2001 to US$4 billion
(Reynolds et al., 2002), but hit US$5.3 billion in
2005 (KVCA, 2006). Ninety percent of all investments are equity-based (KVCA, 2003), and 80% of
the portfolio companies are less than 3 years old
(KVCA, 2003).

Chinese venture capital industry
Venture capital is a relatively new phenomenon in
China (Folta, 1999). China’s rapidly growing economy has led to an increasing need for, and use of,
private equity. Owing to government regulations
and policies, all but a few of the VCs are based
offshore, primarily in Hong Kong, with support
offices in the major Chinese cities (e.g., Shanghai,
Beijing, Shenzhen; Folta, 1999). In 1992, new
regulations created China Direct Investment Funds,
which allow non-Chinese VCs to invest in Chinese
portfolio companies (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003).
As a result, foreign venture capital firms and
corporate venture capital subsidiaries of large
non-Chinese corporations are investing in China
(Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). Most of the activity
has been to investments in expansion and later
stage opportunities within state-owned enterprises
(Folta, 1999). Although the Chinese domestic-only
venture capital industry is small, at $150 million
(Reynolds et al., 2002), it reached US$1.5 billion in
2005 (Ernst & Young, Venture One, 2005). Over
one-third of all private equity in Asia is invested in
China (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003).

Relationship-based vs rules-based
Institutional theory encompasses many different
theories of action (Powell and DiMaggio, 1991),
ranging from sociological conceptions of symbolic
action to economic conceptions based upon
rational choice theory (Scott, 2003). Although
many of these approaches have merit, examination
of the VC venture-screening process seems to favor
the economic perspective, which emphasizes
intentionality and explicit decisions (Powell and
DiMaggio, 1991). According to this view, institutions are ‘humanly devised constraints that
structure human interaction’ (North, 1990: 3).
These constraints are a combination of formal
rules, informal constraints, and their enforcement
characteristics. Formal institutional constraints
include regulatory structures, agencies, laws,
courts, professions, interest groups, and public
opinion (Oliver, 1991), whereas informal institutional constraints are typically considered to be
embedded in language, physical artifacts, and
beliefs (North, 2005). Together these formal and
informal constraints, which have evolved over
time, provide the structure that people impose
upon their lives (North, 2005). Thus, in their efforts
to reduce uncertainty, people construct elaborate
beliefs about the ‘reality’ of the political-economic
system – ‘beliefs that are both a positive model of

Journal of International Business Studies

<-----Page 3----->Venture capitalists’ decision policies across three countries

Andrew L Zacharakis et al

694

the way the system works and a normative model of
how it should work’ (North, 2005: 2).
The question then becomes: ‘What institutions
are at work in shaping how VCs process information and make investment decisions?’ Given that
VCs around the world share an industry that can be
traced in relatively few steps to a common source in
the US, the profession itself can provide an
institutional source of convergence that encourages
decision-makers to engage in actions that lead to
isomorphism (cf. DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). In
fact, research into VC investment decision factors
supports this view. For example, Knight (1994), as
well as Rah et al. (1994), found that VCs around the
world use similar decision factors to predict which
new venture investment opportunities will succeed.
Such findings suggest that the VC profession exerts
considerable pressure upon VCs to employ similar
models of venture success, regardless of potentially
contradicting institutional pressures presented by
differences in country-specific institutions, such as
culture or economy. Thus, as new VCs around the
world attempt to reduce the uncertainty of a new
task, employ best practices, and avoid costly errors
in judgment, they choose to copy a ‘proven’ recipe
by relying upon the types of information used by
Americans to screen new venture investment
opportunities.
Relying upon the same information, however,
does not necessarily imply that this information
means the same thing, or that it is relied upon to
the same extent by VCs across countries. Institutions are typically thought to emerge from, and
evolve through, transactions (North, 1990).
Because each country has its own unique configuration of sociocultural, political, and economic
institutions (Lasserre and Probert, 1994), the costs
of transacting vary by country as a function of trust
(Fukuyama, 1995). ‘[R]isk is at the heart of how
people do and should think about trust but that risk
varies distinctly as the form of the relationship
varies’ (Sheppard and Sherman, 1998: 422). Thus
the costs of transacting reflect an assessment of the
risk associated with trusting others within a society.
In deciding to invest, VCs must consider two
relationships: their relationship with the entrepreneur; and that entrepreneur’s various relationships
with stakeholders. The VC relies upon the entrepreneur to generate a significant return, yet it is
difficult for the VC to directly assess or monitor the
entrepreneur’s behavior. Owing to the entrepreneur’s ability to withhold – consciously or unintentionally – information that is relevant to the VC

Journal of International Business Studies

investment decision (Barry, 1994; Gompers, 1995;
Sapienza and Korsgaard, 1996), the VC is exposed
to risk in the forms of indiscretion, unreliability,
cheating, abuse, neglect, and self-esteem, but is
authorized to remedy violations of trust owing to
the clear hierarchy that emerges as the VC becomes
a shareholder, a member of the board of directors
(Baker and Gompers, 2003), and holder of supermajority voting rights. Therefore the exposure to
risk that comes from this first relationship suggests
that human capital issues are highly relevant to all
VCs, and that VCs will look for attributes that
suggest that the entrepreneur is deserving of the
VC’s trust.
In contrast, the importance of the second type of
relationship that the VC must consider – that is, the
entrepreneur’s relationships with its stakeholders –
would appear to be significantly dependent upon
the relative strength of institutional protections
against opportunistic (untrustworthy) behavior
(Williamson, 1985). Peng (2003) delineates between transactions that are relationship-based and
those that are rules-based. Relationship-based transactions are personalized exchanges between two
parties who know of and trust each other (North,
1990). Although relationship-based transactions
reduce exposure to opportunism (Williamson,
1985), they also constrain the number of transactions that a company can cost-effectively maintain.
This can become inefficient when there is potential
for new relationships that could better maximize
revenue or minimize costs. In fact, Peng (2003)
argues that, as third-party enforcement increases
and transactions become less susceptible to opportunistic behavior, economies hit an inflection point
and move towards market-based economies that
favor rules-based transactions, defined as ‘impersonal exchanges with third-party enforcement’ (Peng,
2003: 280).
Any attempt to evaluate information in an effort
to predict the likelihood of a venture’s success
would appear to depend significantly on whether
rules-based or relationship-based transactions are
the norm within the economy. For example, the US
is characterized by a mature market economy
that is built upon formal legal and regulatory
regimes. Accordingly, it operates primarily through
a rules-based logic of arm’s length transactions.
The primary objective of US VCs is to provide the
highest return possible to their limited partners
so that the VCs can raise subsequent funds
(Wasserman and Robinson, 2000). Even though all
decision factors that VCs consider will impact on

<-----Page 4----->Venture capitalists’ decision policies across three countries

Andrew L Zacharakis et al

695

return, studies find that VCs place more weight on
market factors in the investment-screening stage
(Hall and Hofer, 1993; Knight, 1994; Zacharakis and
Meyer, 1998). As markets become more efficient,
profit potential diminishes at a faster rate owing to
the increased threat of imitators (Schumpeter,
1934). Thus one must consider information that
communicates how big and robust that profit
potential is. Accordingly, market information, such
as market size, market growth, proprietary technology, the number of competitors, and competitor
strength (how they might react to new entrants),
becomes relatively more important than concerns
about opportunistic behavior. Thus, even if investors in rules-based economies don’t necessarily
ascribe market information greater absolute value
in predicting success, US VC decision-makers can
be expected to rely upon market factors more
than their counterparts in countries that are less
rules-based. Accordingly, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 1: When making investment decisions, VCs in strongly rules-based economies (US)
will rely upon one or more market factors (market
size, market growth, proprietary technology,
number of competitors, and competitor strength)
to a greater extent than VCs in less rules-based
economies: (a) Korea and (b) China.
On the other end of the transactional spectrum are
countries in emerging or transitional economies.
Emerging and transitional economies1 (e.g., those
transitioning from centrally planned to market
economies) tend to encourage a focus on the
person – that is, entrepreneur (Peng, 2003). Trust
in the entrepreneur is necessary to compensate for
the lack of a strong rule of law (Chang and Hong,
2000; Peng and Luo, 2000). For example, China’s
weak rule of law increases the importance of
partnering with those whom one knows to avoid
issues of adverse selection and moral hazard
(Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003). Similarly, South
Korea has strong chaebol groups, defined as ‘gathering[s] of formally independent firms under the
single common administrative and financial control of one family’ (Chang and Hong, 2000: 429).
These relationships play an important role in
reducing opportunism, lowering transaction costs,
and simply allowing a business to operate effectively. In other words, a strong network of relationships is necessary to reduce the entrepreneur’s
direct and the VC’s indirect exposure to risks that
are associated with the threat of untrustworthy

behavior – which increases as institutions that
protect against it weaken.
Although a strong form of relationship-based
theory would suggest that VCs transact only with
people they know directly, such a bounded potential population would greatly reduce deal flow and
access to quality investments. Thus VCs in nonrules-based countries need to assess the trustworthiness of entrepreneurs, which may be gleaned from
the entrepreneur’s human capital, such as information about leadership, start-up experience, and
market familiarity. As trust becomes an increasingly
important element for entrepreneurial effectiveness, human capital information becomes increasingly communicative of the amount of risk to
which VCs must expose themselves to accrue the
desired return. Trust arises from beliefs about the
other party’s competence and predictability
(McKnight et al., 1998) – beliefs that are influenced
by assessments of human capital. In other words,
entrepreneurs with a stronger, documented track
record are more likely to have been effective in
managing their networks (working with those
currently in their networks and expanding their
networks to grow their businesses). Thus the
stronger a person’s human capital in management
skills, the more likely it is that they possess strong
social capital. This information is incorporated into
the costs that are used in the VC’s cost–benefit
calculus when choosing whether and in whom to
invest. However, human capital information does
more than communicate to the VC that the
management of the prospective venture investment opportunity has the necessary contacts to
function in a relationship-based economy; it also
conveys that management can be trusted. For
example, a VC reported on one investment in a
Chinese portfolio company in which the entrepreneur of the portfolio company took the money and
ran, disappearing without a trace (Bruton and
Ahlstrom, 2003). Batjargal and Liu (2004) studied
158 Chinese VC decisions and found that VCs
focused strongly on human capital factors to
mitigate transaction risks of opportunistic behavior
as well as transformative risks of proven ability to
execute on the opportunity. Chinese VCs also have
little faith in the reliability of reported information
about the company, because accounting and auditing practices deviate greatly from international
norms (production vs asset valuation) (Bruton and
Ahlstrom, 2003).
The Chinese government is liberalizing the
economy quickly, but with trepidation (Bruton

<-----Page 5----->Venture capitalists’ decision policies across three countries

Andrew L Zacharakis et al

696

and Ahlstrom, 2003). Although the government
encourages venture capital as a means of sustaining
growth, it is concerned about losing control over
privatized and new entrepreneurial start-ups.
Ahlstrom et al. (2000) note that Chinese VCs face
hostility because government officials fear that
private enterprise damages the foundation of
Chinese ideals. Private enterprise is seen as a threat
to the livelihood of government employees (Steinfeld, 1998). This hostility manifests itself in the
form of taxes, regulations, and redistributions of
wealth (Ahlstrom et al., 2000). Thus episodic
influence (government officials are often on VC
boards) may interfere with the screening process.
Government officials may seek to have investments
made into ventures that they favor. However, such
influence may be unstable as increasing discipline
in the form of anticorruption laws increases,
moving China towards the inflection point of a
rules-based economy (Peng, 2003). Before this
inflection point is reached, we would expect
Chinese VCs to make their decisions based more
on human capital information.
Korean VCs face other institutional pressures that
motivate them to focus on the entrepreneur more
than on market factors. Specifically, chaebols
address relationships among the companies. VCs
may be inclined to invest in other related firms
(cross-subsidization) owing to the institutional
pressure of the chaebol (Chang and Hong, 2000).
Again, this encourages Korean VCs to focus more
on human capital factors.
In summary, decision-makers in less mature
economies view human capital information as
relevant not only to transformation costs (i.e., more
experience equals a better-run company) but also to
transaction costs (i.e., more experience means a
better network and less exposure to opportunism).
Thus we expect that the positive relationship
between experience and success will be more
important to VCs operating in emerging and transition economies than to VCs operating in rules-based
economies, as reflected by the degree to which this
information is relied upon in assessing the likelihood of success. Accordingly, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2: When making investment decisions, VCs in emerging economies ([a] Korea) and
VCs in transition economies ([b] China) will rely
upon one or more human capital factors (leadership, market familiarity, and start-up experience)
to a greater extent than VCs in rules-based
economies (US).

Transition vs emerging economies
In the last 20 years, several nations have completely
abandoned or have begun gradual transitions away
from centrally planned economies. As countries
start to liberalize, they become more open to
outside influences. For instance, Chinese VCs are
influenced by their affiliation with offshore partners in Hong Kong (Folta, 1999) and the US. New
regulations, such as the China Direct Investment
Act, which allow non-Chinese VCs to invest
directly into Chinese companies (Bruton and
Ahlstrom, 2003), expose local VCs to the practice
of outside VCs (e.g., US VCs).
Peng and Luo (2000) suggest that rapid economic
growth may accelerate the institutional transition
from relationship-based to rules-based by intensifying interaction with outside players who are
indoctrinated in systems that are characterized
by rules-based transactions. This, coupled with the
fact that China started its liberalization in the
last 20 years under a zeitgeist of globalization
and capitalistic superiority, suggests that the
Chinese VC industry has enjoyed conditions
that have reinforced reliance upon decision-making
more common to institutions that favor rulesbased transactions. In contrast, South Korea’s VC
industry emerged in 1961 when Park Chung Hee
staged a coup, promising to ‘end starvation’
(Economist, 1990). Pursuing an export-oriented
growth policy in which the government combined
protection and correction to keep domestic and
international prices roughly in line, Korea
blended rules-based and relationship-based institutions into a system that resembled mercantilism
more than capitalism (Cumings, 1984). For
instance, Korea pursued a reform package that was
implemented in the early 1960s and which
involved ‘monopoly rights for certain firms, usually
linked explicitly to export performance’ (Cumings,
1984: 27). Concentrating production in chaebols,
‘Korea, Inc.’ emerged (Mason, 1980), and relationship-based transactions grew to characterize the
functioning of the Korean economy. Thus we
expect that, relative to Chinese VCs, Korean VCs
are more likely to focus upon human capital and
less likely to rely upon market information when
making investment decisions. Accordingly, we
hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3: Chinese VCs will rely (a) more
heavily on one or more market factors and (b) less
heavily on one or more human capital factors
than Korean VCs.

Research method
Policy capturing
This study uses policy capturing, a technique that
requires respondents to make a series of judgments
based on a set of decision factors from which the
underlying structure of their decisions can be
decomposed by means of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). This method allows the researcher to
examine the respondents’ decision policies (Hitt
and Barr, 1989), without relying on the respondent’s
(generally inaccurate) introspection (Fischhoff,
1988). A VC’s decision policy refers to the decision
factors that are used in their assessments of
potential portfolio companies and how these
factors are used. Judgments that VCs make regarding ‘how good,’ ‘how satisfactory’ or ‘how attractive’ a particular potential portfolio company
might be on a particular factor are its part-worth
utilities or ‘weights’ for the levels of that factor.
Research instrument and experimental design
To identify the pertinent decision factors, we asked
VCs outside the sample of the study (primarily VCs
based in Chicago and New York) to provide actual
investment decision scenarios, complete with business plans. From these plans the lead researcher
extracted information factors of interest, providing
the entire list, with a description of each factor, to a
colleague unfamiliar with the business plans. Both
judges then independently coded all appropriate
decision factors. Value ranges given to each decision factor allowed it to be compared across profiles
(Stewart, 1988). For decision factors of the new
venture’s management team (general leadership
experience, market familiarity, and experience with
start-ups), values are defined as averages for the
whole management team. Where possible, we used
concrete values (e.g., market size), but representative distributions are appropriate for subjective
decision factors (Stewart, 1988). For the two subjective information factors (proprietary technology
and competitor strength), we used a five-point scale
from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Overall inter-judge
reliability was 87.5%. Based on Berelson’s (1952)
report that inter-judge reliability typically ranges
from 66 to 95%, we deem our coding reliable.
We control for a number of factors in our
directions to the participants, such as stage and
fund focus, the VC’s existing portfolio and investment location (see the Appendix). The instrument
was presented in the VC’s native language. For the
Chinese and Korean samples, the instrument was

translated into the native language and then backtranslated into English to ensure accuracy.

Sampling plan, survey method, and sample
To test our hypotheses under the parameters
established by institutional theory as it relates to
relationship-based and rules-based economies, we
needed to identify VCs from countries that represented different points along the continuum
between relationship-based and rules-based economies. The US is characteristic of a highly mature
economy, and falls towards the end point of rulesbased economies. Furthermore, the US has the
oldest and most established VC industry in the
world, and is a benchmark by which other VC
industries can be compared. China and Korea, on
the other hand, represent to varying degrees
relationship-based economies. They were chosen
because of their relatively similar culture (Confucius-based traditions), yet differing governing systems. Moreover, the lead author had access to VCs
in each country, allowing for a direct replication
(aside from translation) of the decision policy
experiment. The following paragraphs give further
details of the samples within each country.
The US
The sample for this experiment was 31 practicing
VCs from three entrepreneurial ‘hotbeds’:
" the Colorado Front Range (primarily the Denver/
Boulder metro area);
" Silicon Valley in California; and
" Boston.
It is notoriously difficult to secure VC participation
in academic research. We relied on a well-placed
industry participant to write an introductory letter
to secure participation. As we interviewed VCs, we
would ask them to refer others. In total, 73 US VCs
participated in a larger experimental study that had
three separate treatments that differed by the
amount of information viewed. The 31 reported
in this research viewed eight decision factors,
including human capital and market-based factors.
VCs in the other treatments viewed fewer factors.
The Colorado and California data were collected
in 1995, and the Boston data were collected in 1998
using the same instrument (the decision policies
did not differ between regions or between time
periods of data collection (Po0.05)). The typical VC
in the sample was male (90%), 45 years old
(s.d.¼11.5), had a master’s degree (most likely in
business), and had been a VC for 9 years (s.d.¼6.6).

The typical firm for which the VC worked had $232
million under management (range $2 million to $5
billion; s.d.¼$393 million), employed 16 investment professionals (range 1 to 65; s.d.¼28.4),
focused primarily on early stage ventures, had been
in business for 13.3 years (range 1 to 32; s.d.¼7.8),
and invested $3.5 million per venture (s.d.¼3.7).
This sample is relatively representative of the US VC
community as a whole, although slightly biased
towards the more successful, well-known firms. For
example, seven of the 10 top VC firms that invest in
early stage deals, as rated on ten metrics, are represented in the sample (Aragon, 2001), and the sample
firms tend to be larger ($232 million vs $155 million
for population; Thomson VentureXpert, 2000).

South Korea
The South Korean sample consisted of 49 practicing
VCs, all from Seoul, which comprised representatives from 16 different firms (out of a total of 148
Korean VC firms). The sample was contacted by a
Korean professor and another Korean expert, who
was a member of the KVCA. Data were collected in
2001–2002. The typical VC in the sample was male
(94%), 35 years old (s.d.¼3.5), had a college degree
(most often in engineering, but closely followed by
business), and had been a VC for 5 years (s.d.¼4.8).
The typical firm for which the VC worked had
$32 million under management (s.d.¼$120 million), employed nine investment professionals
(s.d¼14.1), focused primarily on early stage ventures, had been in business for 2.7 years (s.d.¼2.8),
and invested $1.3 million per venture (s.d.¼0.8).
The sample is fairly representative of the population as a whole. The average fund size is a bit
smaller ($32 million vs $39 million), which can be
attributed primarily to some large outliers that
aren’t included in this sample. For example, the
largest fund in Korea – the Korean Road Infrastructure Fund at over $527 million – is not in the
sample.
China
The Chinese sample consisted of 39 practicing VCs:
21 from Beijing and 18 from Shenzhen, which
represents two of the three centers for venture
capital in China (Batjargal and Liu, 2004). The data
were collected prior to seminars conducted by one
of the authors in affiliation with Bright China in
November 2000 (Beijing) and March 2001 (Shenzhen). These VCs represented 21 firms, which is 11%
of the total of 180 active VC firms in 2001 and 31%
of the firms in the two sampled cities (Batjargal and

Journal of International Business Studies

Liu, 2004). The typical VC in the sample was male
(97%), and 36 years old (s.d.¼5.6); half had a
college degree, and half had an advanced graduate
degree (most often in engineering, but closely
followed by business) and had been a VC for 1 year
(s.d.¼1.2). The typical firm employed 33 investment professionals2 (s.d¼29.2). The average fund
size was $55 million vs the country average of $30
million. However, if we remove the large firms
employing more than 80 VC professionals, the
average was $26 million suggesting our sample
firms were somewhat smaller than the population
as a whole.
As can be seen from descriptions of the sample, at
the individual level there was disparity between
individuals in their years of experience with
venture capital. This experience difference could
represent an alternative explanation to institutional influences. Therefore we controlled for VC
experience in the analysis that follows.

Independent variables, levels, and dependent
variable
The experimental design required each VC to assess
50 randomized ventures on eight decision factors
(see Appendix for the directions provided to the
respondents, and a sample profile). The eight
decision factors were identified from the literature
(e.g., Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; MacMillan et al.,
1985, 1987), resulting in a list of over 100 possible
decision factors. To narrow the list down to a
manageable number for conducting the experiment, we selected those variables that were deemed
the most important in the prior research, eliminating those that were highly correlated with each
other (which reduces problems of multicollinearity), and finally employing a consulting expert VC
to verify that the selected factors were indeed
important and representative of the actual decision
process.
The eight decision factors were:
" leadership experience (average number of years
of experience the management team has in
leadership positions);
" proprietary technology (on a five-point scale
ranging from no protection to extremely high
proprietary protection);
" market familiarity (mean number of years of
experience the team has in the market);
" start-up record (mean number of past start-up
experiences for team members);
" market size (total revenues for most recent year);

<-----Page 8----->Venture capitalists’ decision policies across three countries

Andrew L Zacharakis et al

699

" market growth (percentage growth in revenues
over the last 5 years);
" number of competitors (number of direct competitors); and
" competitor strength (relative concentration of
market on a five-point scale ranging from a few
dominant competitors to an emerging market).
The instructions specified that all decision factors
not included in the experiment were to be
presumed constant across all venture profiles.
The dependent variable for this experiment is the
VC’s assessment of how likely the venture is to
succeed, as measured on a seven-point Likert scale
anchored by ‘10 $ or more on investment’ and
‘complete loss of investment.’ Rate of return has
been deemed an appropriate dependent variable for
VCs’ decisions (Roure and Keeley, 1990).
The more assessments each participant completes, the higher the reliability and stability of
the results; yet too many profiles may tire the judge
and limit participation. A rule of thumb is to have a
minimum of five profiles for every decision factor
being tested (Executive Decision Services, 1991).
Five cases times eight decision factors equals 40
cases. In addition, we had five repeated cases to
assess response reliability. We rounded the number
to 50 profiles. Fatigue is unlikely to be of concern in
this experiment. First, the number of decision
factors in each treatment was relatively low (Hitt
et al., 2000, had 30 profiles with 14 decision
factors), and the mean time taken to complete the
experiment was less than 30 min. Second, the order
of the profiles was randomized for each experiment, and the results were consistent across
individuals. Third, individuals were relatively consistent in their responses (test–retest reliability of
72% is comparable with Shepherd’s (1999) 69%).

Limitations
Policy capturing, as with all techniques, has limitations, although throughout the design and administration of this study attempts were made to
minimize these limitations. Nonetheless, a few of
the drawbacks should be addressed. As with any
experiment, the issue of reductionism must be
considered. Although the scenarios are based on
actual firms that received venture backing, the
subjects are exposed to a decision situation that
does not perfectly mirror the ‘real life’ decision.
Such ‘paper tests’ affect the external validity of
many lens model experiments (Brehmer and Brehmer,
1988). But ‘professional judgment may y involve

some abstract coding of the [decision factors],
similar to that provided by policy capturing
tasks’ (Brehmer and Brehmer 1988: 89). Moreover,
because the VC screening decision has a large
‘paper’ component in the real world (i.e., much of
the VC’s information comes from business plans),
correlation between the experimental task and the
‘real world’ decision should be even higher. Therefore, although the information within the decision
exercise does not perfectly mirror the more complex ‘real life’ decision, policy-capturing experiments remain valid methods for deriving what
information decision-makers actually use (Hitt and
Middlemist, 1979; Hitt et al., 2000). Although these
criticisms of policy capturing have merit, and
do represent limitations of the technique, our
approach is consistent with that of other policycapturing studies (e.g., Hitt and Tyler, 1991).

Results
The experiment provides 50 decisions (level 1 data)
per VC, and therefore 1550 observations for the US
sample, 2450 for the Korean sample, and 1950 for
the China sample. Although this means that there
are a large number of degrees of freedom for the
subsequent analyses, there may be autocorrelation,
because the decisions on each set of 50 observations
are nested within individuals. Because decisions
within an individual may be more similar to
decisions across an individual, assumptions of
independence may be violated, rendering ordinary
least squares regression an inappropriate technique
for this analysis. HLM accounts for variance among
individuals such that all observations are independent. Furthermore, HLM provides the opportunity
to control (e.g., Tomlinson et al., 2004) and test for
individual differences (e.g., Kristof-Brown et al.,
2002). Specifically, we controlled for individual
differences in venture capital experience while
testing whether institution explained variance in
decision policies.
First, we generated a model for each of the
samples – one each for the US, China, and Korea.
Then, we tested whether differences in decision
policies across VCs could be explained by the
institution in which they are embedded, controlling for venture capital experience. In other words,
controlling for VC experience, does institution
significantly explain variance in decision weights
(the size and sign of coefficients for each decision
factor)?
Presented in Table 1 are the models for each
country – the US, China, and Korea. For each model

we report the variance explained in VCs’ assessments by the decision policies, intraclass correlation, and the decision policies as represented by
coefficients (standardized) for each decision factor
and their corresponding standard error, t-ratio, and
levels of significance. The decision policies of VCs
from each country consistently explained approximately 50% of the variance in return on investment
assessments (49% for the sample of US VCs, 50%
for the sample of Chinese VCs, and 53% for Korean
VCs), which is consistent with other conjoint
studies.3 The intraclass correlation indicates the
degree of dependence among decisions within
individuals (Bryk and Raudenbush, 1992), which
is 0.092 for the model of US VCs, 0.078 for the
model of Chinese VCs, and 0.169 for the model of
Korean VCs. The decision policy for Chinese VCs
significantly used all eight decision factors, whereas
the decision policies for US VCs and Korean VCs
used seven decision factors (both decision policies
did not significantly use start-up experience in their
assessments of return on investment).
How do the decision policies of VCs from one
country differ from the policies of VCs from the
other countries? An indication of these differences
can be inferred from Table 1; but are those
differences significant? HLM allows us to investigate the interaction of an institution effect (level 2
data) on VCs’ decision policies. A comparison
between US, Chinese, and Korean VCs is displayed

Journal of International Business Studies

in Table 2. Column 1 of Table 2 indicates the
decision factors and model statistics. The next three
columns report distinctions between the samples of
VCs from the US and Korea, and the next three
between the samples of VCs from the US and
China. The three columns for each distinction
represent the intercept (which is the mean assessment controlling for the level 2 variables), venture
capital experience (which is a level 2 variable used
as a control), and country (which is the level 2
variable used to capture institutional influences).
We now investigate each distinction.
The model for the sample of VCs from the US and
Korea explains 50.7% of the variance in assessments
(level 1 variance). The coefficients for the intercept
indicate that this group of VCs significantly use
seven of the eight factors (start-up experience is
not significant). Whereas a positive intercept
coefficient indicates that a higher level on the
factor is considered to be desirable, a negative sign
indicates that a higher level on the factor is
considered to be less desirable by VCs. Of the five
market information variables (market size, market
growth, proprietary technology, number of competitors, and strength of competitors), three were
relied upon more heavily by US VCs – market
size (coefficient¼0.215; Po0.05), market growth
(coefficient¼0.163; Po0.05), and number of
competitors (coefficient¼%0.160; Po0.05), one
was relied upon more heavily by Korean

VCs (proprietary technology: coefficient¼%0.151;
Po0.05), and one was insignificant (strength of
competitors). Thus US VCs emphasize market-based
factors to a greater extent than their Korean VC
counterparts, providing support for Hypothesis 1a.
Although the sample of US VCs also placed
greater importance on start-up experience
(coefficient¼0.150; Po0.05), the variable was not
significantly used by VCs from either country.
Therefore it is not relevant to our test. Moreover,
there was no significant difference in humancapital-related variables such as market familiarity
or leadership experience. Therefore we did not find
support for the hypothesis that VCs in Korea rely
more heavily on human capital factors than US VCs
(H2a not supported).
Because we are interested in the moderating role
of institution (the level 2 variable) rather than its
direct effect, we are interested in the proportion of
variation explained in the weights of each decision
factor rather than the variance by the level two
variables directly on the assessment of likely
success. For those factors used significantly differently by the two samples, country (and venture
capital experience) explains 11.1% of the variance
in weights for market size, 5.7% for start-up
experience, 4.4% for market growth, 4.0% for the
number of competitors, and 3.7% for proprietary
technology.
The model for the sample of VCs from the US and
China explains 44.7% of the variance in assess-

ments (level 1 variance). The coefficients for the
intercept indicate that this group of VCs significantly uses all the decision factors in their overall
decision policy. Controlling for VC experience and
based on the country model (column six), VCs from
the US place less weight (relative to VCs from
China) on market familiarity (coefficient¼%0.291;
Po0.01), leadership experience (coefficient¼%0.303;
Po0.01), and strength of competition (coefficient¼
0.388; Po0.01). For those factors that were used
significantly differently by the two samples, country explains 34.4% of the variance in weights for
market familiarity, 23.6% for leadership experience,
and 17.1% for strength of competitors. These
findings do not support Hypothesis 1b that US
VCs rely more heavily on market factors, but we do
find that Chinese VCs rely more heavily on two
of the human capital factors – market familiarity
and leadership experience – providing support for
Hypothesis 2b.4
The model for the sample of VCs from China and
Korea explains 51% of the variance in assessments
(level 1 variance). The coefficients for the intercept
indicate that this group of VCs significantly uses
seven of the eight criteria (excluding start-up
experience). Controlling for VC experience and
based on the country model (column nine), VCs
from China place more weight (relative to VCs from
Korea) on market growth (coefficient¼0.160;
Po0.05), market familiarity (coefficient¼0.186;
Po0.01), leadership experience (coefficient¼0.241;

Po0.01), start-up experience (coefficient¼0.119;
Po0.01), and strength of competition (coefficient¼
%0.112; Po0.10). For those criteria used significantly differently by the two samples, country (and
venture capital experience) explains 17.4% of the
variance in weights for market familiarity, 13.8%
for start-up experience, 10.3% for leadership experience, and 6.1% for market growth. The findings
support Hypothesis 3a that Chinese VCs relied
more heavily upon market growth than their
Korean counterparts, and Chinese VCs rely more
than Korean VCs on such human capital criteria as
market familiarity, leadership experience, and startup experience (H3b is not supported).

Discussion and conclusion
Through the lens of institutional theory, we
examined whether economic institutions influence
how VCs use information. Consistent with prior
studies, we found that VCs from different countries
use the same information factors in their screening
decisions, but it appears that economic institutions
influence the degree to which these VCs rely upon
different types of information. Therefore, even
though a shared profession may, through normative pressure, lead VCs across countries to use the
same information, differences in economic institutions may introduce variation regarding which
information is relied upon most heavily.
We expected that judgments of investment
potential would be institutionally dependent, so
that VCs from mature market economies would
give more weight to market-oriented information
whereas VCs from emerging or transitional economies would be more likely to favor human capital
information. We reasoned that the weak enforcement of property rights, which typifies many
relationship-based economies, would increase the
risk of trusting other parties and thereby enhance
the importance of transaction costs in the evaluation of VCs’ new venture investment opportunities.
As a result, VCs facing higher risks would focus on
aspects of human capital, such as the networks and
social influence that often accompany experience.
In contrast, we argued that, in a society characterized by strong property rights enforcement, the
importance of transaction costs would diminish in
comparison with concerns about transformation
costs. Consequently, VCs in rules-based systems
were expected to emphasize market information
relatively more than human capital information,
viewing the latter as necessary but insufficient for
the creation of value.

Journal of International Business Studies

Consistent with this argument, we found that US
VCs weighed market information more heavily
than Korean VCs in the venture screening process
(Hypothesis 1a), supporting the notion that the US
is indeed more rules-based than Korea. We can
depict each country’s relative position on a Cartesian plane with rules-based on the y-axis and
relationship-based on the x-axis (see Figure 1).
Thus, because US VCs place greater emphasis on
market factors than Korean VCs, and because both
are relatively low on using relationship-based
factors, we position the US in the upper left
quadrant (high market, low human capital) and
Korea in the lower left quadrant (low market and
low human capital). We also found that Chinese
VCs tend to focus more on human capital factors
than US VCs (Hypothesis 2b). Thus China appears
to be more relationship-based than the US, as
depicted on the x-axis of the perceptual map shown
in Figure 1. Finally, we found that Chinese VCs
differed from Korean VCs by relying more upon
both market information (Hypothesis 3a) and
human capital (the opposite direction than proposed in Hypothesis 3b). Thus China appears to be
both more relationship-based and more rules-based
than Korea5 (which places China in the upper right
of the quadrant).
Figure 1 conveys a departure from the simpler
conception represented in the hypotheses. Instead
of a single dimension that is anchored on one end
by the relationship-based transactions of emerging
economies and on the other by the rules-based
transactions of mature economies, our results
suggest that both may coexist (e.g., China). This
potential for coexistence suggests that people
consider market information in addition to human
capital as they augment, rather than replace,
existing relationship-based systems with more
rules-based concerns. For instance, theory suggested that Chinese VCs would give more weight
to leadership experience than US VCs because of
the importance of social capital for doing business
in a relational economy. This implies an either/or
logic in which VCs use leadership experience either
for what it communicates about transaction costs or
for what it conveys about transformation costs, but
our findings suggest that Chinese VCs may be using
it to contemplate both transformation costs and
transaction costs. In other words, Chinese VCs are
using human capital information not only to assess
the entrepreneur’s trustworthiness, but also to
assess whether the entrepreneur has the skills
necessary to succeed. Considering that China is

undergoing a rapid transformation, there may be
a dearth of talented managers and entrepreneurs
to keep pace with the country’s rapid growth.6
To explore this possibility further, other forms
of data collection, such as interviews, are necessary.
Our results are mixed. Although some results are
consistent with theoretical predictions, other
hypotheses are not, which introduces a few questions. Why isn’t there a bigger difference between
US and Korean VCs on human capital factors? Why
isn’t there a bigger difference between US and
Chinese VCs on market information factors? And,
finally, why do Korean and Chinese VCs differ
along both dimensions? One explanation may be
that the policy-capturing experiment is too coarse
to capture all these differences adequately. For
instance, theory suggests that Korean VCs would
weigh human capital more heavily than US VCs,
because Korean VCs operate in an economy that is
characterized by relational contracting (i.e., chaebols) and an overall lack of support for the arm’s
length transactions that are more common in the
West (Peng, 2003). As a result, backing the wrong
entrepreneur because of a failure to consider
human capital could be expected to expose a
Korean VC to opportunism more than it would a
US VC. However, the nature of the policy-capturing
experiment precludes a natural human capital
screen that Korean VCs are likely to use. In other
words, it is possible that Korean VCs more often
consider deals in which the entrepreneur is already
somehow connected to their chaebol (Chang and
Hong, 2000). This could explain why US and
Korean VCs did not differ more in terms of their
reliance upon human capital information. A comparative examination of initial ties (both direct,

where the VC knows the entrepreneur a priori, and
indirect, where a trusted person refers the entrepreneur to the VC) might shed some light on this
non-finding (see Shane and Cable, 2002). For
instance, do Korean VCs have more and stronger
direct and indirect ties to the entrepreneurs they
fund than do US VCs?
The hypothesized difference between US and
Chinese VCs regarding reliance upon market
information was not supported, but this is not
entirely unexpected. Rapid liberalization and
intense inflow of cash from Western investors
may account for Chinese VCs’ surprisingly high
reliance upon market factors when deciding which
ventures to back. Because of China’s political legacy
of central planning and long cultural tradition of
developing and maintaining personal relationships
(guanxi) (Xin and Pearce, 1996), Chinese VCs pay
more attention to human capital information than
US VCs, but this appears to be in addition to, rather
than in lieu of, market information. As the
perceptual map in Figure 1 reveals, the difference
between US and Chinese VC decision policies is
most accurately described as a comparison between
market information (US) and market information
plus human capital information (China). Whereas,
in the US, transformations costs are much more
salient than transaction costs, which are typically
assumed to be low, Chinese VCs must consider
both transformation costs and transaction costs
when evaluating whether a business is capable not
only of producing value but also of transferring that
value to its customer. Thus it would seem that
China may be in the process of augmenting a
relationship-based economy with rules-based concerns rather than simply replacing one economic

institution with another. If so, these findings
contrast with Peng’s (2003) supposition that economies hit an inflection point and move from
relationship-based to rules-based institutions. Our
findings suggest that this transformation might be
more complex.
New research is needed to test whether and why
China might be facing both relationship-based and
rules-based institutions. The current manuscript
looks only at the screening stage of the decision
process. Broadening research to include deal flow,
due diligence and negotiations might help us
understand how relationship-based and rules-based
institutions are interacting. We may find that the
Chinese VCs use different avenues to find entrepreneurs. Just as with Korean VCs, the number and
type of ties might differ in China. For instance,
Chinese VCs may do more deals with family
members or through government referrals. Due
diligence might also differ. If the VC needs to
gauge trustworthiness and managerial skill, the
due diligence process might be longer. The Chinese
VC may spend more time getting to know the
entrepreneur as a person than would the US VC.
Digging into the other phases of VC decision
process may help us better understand the findings
here.
This leaves the question of why Chinese VCs rely
more heavily than Korean VCs on both market and
human capital factors. A synthesis of previous
discussion points suggests that China’s economy
is more benevolent than Korea’s, accounting for the
difference in the use of market factors, and that
China has political as well as cultural forces,
contributing to the difference in the use of human
capital factors. Thus Korean VCs may pay less
attention than their VC counterparts in the US
and China because of a natural pre-screening
attributed to their participation in chaebol groups.
There are plausible and non-institutional explanations for why Chinese VCs rely more heavily
upon human capital information than their counterparts in either the US or Korea. For instance,
compared with the US or Korea, China is a relative
newcomer to capitalism, and therefore it is possible
that experienced and skilled human capital remains
scarce. This scarcity, in turn, could cause humancapital-related information to become more salient
in the decision-making process, providing an
alternative explanation for Hypotheses 2b and 3b.
Although we recognize the merit of such arguments, and believe that future research should
examine this and other explanations that might

Journal of International Business Studies

arise from alternative theoretical approaches lying
within and outside institutional theory, we believe
that VC decision-making is nevertheless impacted
by the institutions in which it transpires. For
example, the scarce human capital argument presented above may still be attributed to variance in
institutions. In other words, why does a shortage of
human capital exist in China? Perhaps it is because
the political economic institution of communism,
which was enforced through government, believed
that private enterprise threatened the livelihood of
government employees (Steinfeld, 1998) and
damaged the foundation of Chinese ideals
(Ahlstrom et al., 2000), and that it should therefore
be exterminated or at least discouraged through
taxes, regulations, and redistributions of wealth
(Ahlstrom et al., 2000). In such a scenario, scarcity
does indeed explain why Chinese VCs would rely
more heavily on this information than Americans
or Koreans, but arguably institutions act as the
underlying cause of the scarcity. Thus the institution in which one functions becomes an indirect,
rather than direct, moderator influencing the
information to which one attends when making
decisions of whether and in whom to invest.
In summary, our investigation of VC decisionmaking policies across economic institutions
suggests a slightly more complex picture than
originally anticipated. We find that economic
institutions may moderate the investment decisions of VC by influencing which information is
most greatly attended to, but we also find that the
single-dimension depiction of economies as either
relationship-based or rules-based may neglect the
dual importance of transaction costs and transformation costs in dictating which information must
be considered for an effective decision. Thus the
unique environmental conditions that these decision-makers face, such as weak property rights
regimes or benevolent markets, appear to dictate
to a certain extent which information will be
contemplated.
A second contribution is that our study provides
entrepreneurs with insight into VC decision policies and how they differ across countries. An
entrepreneur launching a venture in the US needs
to articulate the attractiveness of the market
relatively more than the human capital of the
team. Considering that VCs are active in helping
entrepreneurs complete their teams, our findings
make sense. In China, on the other hand, entrepreneurs must convince VCs that human capital is
strong and in place, not only to convey the

<-----Page 14----->Venture capitalists’ decision policies across three countries

705

trustworthiness of the team but also to persuade the
VC that they possess management skills that are
relatively scarce but essential to functioning in an
economy that offers an incredible number of
opportunities to those entrepreneurs who can
navigate the lingering legacy of a relationshipbased economy.

Notes
1
Emerging economies are ‘low-income, rapid
growth countries using economic liberalization as their
primary engine of growth’ (Hoskisson et al., 2000:
249). Transition economies are subsets of emerging
economies, and comprise countries that are moving
from socialist to capitalist economies (Hoskisson et al.,
2000).
2
The Chinese sample firm size is skewed because
many of the subjects work within large Chinese banks.
They also tended to view everyone who worked for the
bank as a potential investment associate.

In a study of Nigerians’ decision policies towards
the purchasing of foreign cars and foreign televisions
(Okechuku and Onyemah, 1999), the models’ mean
explained variance was 0.31 and 42, respectively.
4
Chinese VCs also relied more upon the market
information variable of competitor strength, although
this was not hypothesized.
5
Because Chinese VCs relied more heavily upon
market factors than US VCs, who relied upon market
factors more than Korean VCs, transitivity would
suggest that Chinese VCs should rely upon market
factors more than Korean VCs. Our results are
consistent with this expectation, but they are imperfectly intransitive, in that the distance between
Chinese VCs and Korean VCs was not greater than
the distance between US VCs and Korean VCs.
However, given Tversky’s (1977) observations regarding
the multidimensional nature of features of similarity,
and the difficulties that this multidimensionality presents for ever achieving transitivity among complex
units, such as nations, our findings are remarkably
consistent.

Appendix
You will be asked to judge the potential of several
venture proposals based upon a set of decision criteria.
For this exercise, please envision yourself as a
venture capitalist in a position to make decisions
about venture proposals that are delivered to you.
You have just recently completed funding of a new
investment fund and are looking for ventures in
which to invest. The following ventures are in hightechnology industries and geographical locations
in which you normally invest. The presented
ventures are primarily early start-up businesses.
After examining the various business plans and
completing initial due diligence, a junior associate
has summarized key factors and provided comparative information for each factor. The factors are as
follows:
(1) Start-up record – number of past start-ups in which
various team members have been involved.
(2) Market familiarity – average years of experience per
team member that founding team has in market
in which new venture is proposed; measures how
knowledgeable team is about the market.
(3) Leadership ability – average number of years of
management experience per team member.
(4) Proprietary protection – level of protection provided because product/service or process to

(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)

deliver product/service is unique and difficult
to imitate; presented as a scale ranging from 1
(not at all proprietary) to 5 (extremely high
proprietary protection).
Market size – total market sales revenues for most
current year.
Market growth – percentage growth (decline) of
market sales revenues over last five years.
Competitors – numbers of identified direct competitors new venture faces in targeted market.
Competitor strength – measures likelihood of
competitor retaliation on a scale from 1 (fragmented market or emerging market with no
clear market leader) to 5 (concentrated market
with clear market leaders).

Given the fact that you need to invest your fund’s
assets, you are asked to assess the potential of
several venture proposals. Although other information factors might further assist your assessment,
please make the decision as best as you can based
upon the provided information. Choose how likely
an investment in each venture is to succeed on the
7 point ‘Probability of Success’ scale listed below
each venture. The scale is anchored by highest
probability of success (10 $ or more return on
investment) and the lowest probability of success
(complete loss of investment).
