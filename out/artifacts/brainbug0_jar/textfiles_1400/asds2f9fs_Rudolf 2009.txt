ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
by
MARGARET M. RUDOLF

Abstract

Trust is recognized as being an important factor that enables the quality of working life in
organizations. Trust is identified as an important leadership and management competency
helping organizations navigate the change management process. The effectiveness of an
organization's capacity for change is closely associated with the degree of trust within an
organizational workplace.

This study takes an empirical approach exploring trust-building and trust-breaking behaviours,
and the capacity for change in an organizational context. Two survey instruments, merged into
one, were carried out at Bell Canada's Secure Channel Operations and Delivery program sector
to find out if there is a correlation between trust variables and the capacity for change. The
survey findings demonstrate there is a definite correlation between these variables. Moreover,
regression analyses demonstrate that competence trust behaviours are a strong predictor for an
organization's capacity for change.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION

Background
Trust is an ambiguous concept and a complex phenomenon that was not given much
serious academic attention until the mid-'90s, which signalled the start of significant research,
books, and publications on this topic (Bachmann, 2006; Kramer & Tyler, 1996). Perhaps this
sudden and intensive interest was the result of a series of aggressive, bottom-line driven
approaches to organizational restructuring that is understood as business process reengineering. More recently, there were a number of well-publicised corporate scandals, such as
corporate theft at Enron and illicit document shredding at Arthur Andersen (Forbes, 2008). The
human toll resulting from these incidents often resulted in the depletion of human resources;
this depletion affected traditional value sets that included the expectation that an organization
would care for its employees. In addition to other consequences, broken promises led to broken
trust, corporate disloyalty, and dysfunctional work ethics. Scholars became aware of the
relationship between trust and questionable organizational mores, and recognised that human
trust is a concept that had been neglected in organizational change studies (Arnott, 2007b;
Bachmann & Zaheer, 2006a; Bijlsma-Frankema & Koopman, 2003; Bijlsma-Frankema &
Woolthuis, 2005a; Galford & Drapeau, 2002; Gibb, 1978; D. J. Johnston, 2003; Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996; Morris, Cascio, & Young, 1999; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; R. Rogers,
1995a, 1995b; R. W. Rogers & Riddle, 2006; Shaw, 1997; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Sitkin &
Stickel, 1996; Tyler, 2003; Tyler & Kramer, 1996; Van de Ven & Ring Smith, 2006).

<-----Page 12----->2
Trust, being an abstraction, is not something one can touch in a concrete way. Trust
becomes real to the extent that authors give this abstraction meaning, and situate the meaning
in a historical context which tells us how this understanding makes sense. Meaning is enhanced
when the concept of trust is operationalized with examples of how it is understood and lived, in
practice. There are many interpretations of trust, ranging from rational and cognitive, to
affective and behavioural. Adherents of structuration theory suggest that trust is a socially
constructed phenomenon that can be made to happen. This complexity makes it challenging for
researchers to develop a clean and generally accepted model for study (Dietz & den Hartog,
2006; Garfinkel, 1963; Mollering, 2006a, 2006b; Seligman, 1997; Sydow, 2006).
Because trust implies a process between people, it is open to multiple influences that in
themselves are the product of a historical time, a particular culture, environmental
circumstances, and the psychological predispositions of people involved in the act of trust
making (Huff & Kelley, 2003; Seligman, 1997). Given the increasing complexity of our world
and the relentless need for organizations to adapt to changing environmental priorities,
organizations are required to be nimble and prepared for change in order to survive. Trust
between managers and employees has an effect on how an organization adapts to the need for
change; the way this change is operationalized can influence the quality of trust within an
organization and enable the development of trust equity (Bruhn, 2002; Kotter & Schlesinger,
1979; Lines, Selart, Espedal, & Johansen, 2005; Poppo, Zheng Zhou, & Ryu, 2008; Ring &
Van de Ven, 1992; Rosell & Yankelovich, 2003; Zak & Knack, 2001). Living as we do in a
continued state of global tension, it is imperative to understand better how to work together in
harmony with people from different cultures, religions, and understandings of trust in this time
of complexity, especially in the face of growing isolationist sentiments (Campbell & Kirby,

<-----Page 13----->3
2008; Dervitsiotis, 2006; Ring & Van de Ven, 1992; Smollan, 2006; Woodward & Hendry,
2004).

Statement of the Problem
This study adapts an empirically measurable research approach to explore, in practice,
which behaviours build trust, and which ones break trust, and how these behaviours are related
to an organization's capacity for change. Two separate surveys are used for this purpose. The
organization being studied is living through a major change process; the surveys provide a
snapshot of trust behaviours within a specific program sector and this sector's capacity for
change. To date, no studies have explored empirically the relationship between trust
behaviours, and an organization's capacity for change.
The Organization Trust Scale, developed by Reina and Reina (2006b) comprises 54
questions that explore trust behaviours. The Organizational Change Recipients' Beliefs Scale,
developed by Armenakis, Bernerth, Pitts, & Walker (2007), comprises 24 questions used to
gauge an organization's capacity for change. Findings from these two surveys were correlated
to explore which variables indicate statistically significant relationships between three
subscales of trust behaviours; that is, communication, competence and contractual behaviours,
and capacity for change.
There have been two previous studies that used the Reina survey methodology.
Focussed on team building, Mendoza (2001) used the Team Trust Scale to examine the impact
of experiential methods on team development to help organizations adopt innovative team
development practices. The other study (Seely-Troiano, 2005) examined leadership behaviours
related to trust-building and breaking, using the Leadership Trust Scale. My approach adds to

<-----Page 14----->4
this research by exploring trust behaviours from an organizational perspective, using the
Organizational Trust Survey (OTS).

Research Questions
I took a behavioural approach, and adopted a transactional definition of trust. This
means that trust is understood as a relational process whose principal characteristics include
the heuristics of communication, competence, and contractual commitments (Reina & Reina,
2006b). A similar ontological lens was used to explore capacity for change. That is, an
organization's preparedness for change was viewed in terms of which beliefs, influencing
behaviours, help get an organization ready for change (Armenakis et al, 2007; Armenakis,
Harris, & Feild, 1999; Armenakis & Mossholder, 1993). My study explored the relationship
between trust and capacity for change with these two research questions:
•

Which trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, positively?

•

Which trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, negatively?

Definition of Trust and Capacity for Change
A detailed review of the literature identifies a number of interpretations of trust, within
various parameters of analysis: dyadic, group, organizational and societal. These ontologies
look at psychological, sociological, political, biological, and organizational perspectives.
Understanding that trust has to be lived in a relationship in order to make sense, I adopted a
transactional view of trust. This means that trust is understood as a relational process whose
principal characteristics include the heuristics of communication, competence, and contractual
commitments. Within these three measurable elements, 16 behaviours were identified that

<-----Page 15----->5
contribute to building and repairing trust (Reina & Reina, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a). These are
indicated in Table 1.

The literature suggests that a state of organizational change creates an environment of
instability that provokes cognitive and affective responses. These lead to an organizational
situation that affects behaviours; the perceptions of a specific change process are related to the
capacity of that organization to carry out change (Cunningham, Woodward, Shannon,
Macintosh, Lendrum, 2002; Eby, Adams, Russell, & Gaby, 2000; Smollan, 2006). Whether an
organization is able to carry out change can be associated with a number of behaviours that,
when measured, could suggest whether an organization is prepared to deal with change. Five
sets of behaviours have been identified that are a synthesis of principal organizational
development concepts (Armenakis & Bedelan, 1999; Armenakis et al, 2007; Armenakis et al,
1999; Armenakis & Harris, 2002; Armenakis & Mossholder, 1993; Weick & Quinn, 1999).
These are:
•

Discrepancy, which is defined as the need for change;

<-----Page 16----->6
•

Appropriateness, which suggests that the appropriate corrective action matches the
situation, thereby eliminating the discrepancy;

•

Efficacy, which is the perceived capability to implement the change;

•

Principal support, which demonstrates the degree to which change leaders are prepared
to enable the change; and

•

Valence, which is the perception that rewards are sufficient to motivate the need for
change.

Importance of the Study and Benefits
A number of academics cite the need to understand better the trust process and the
consequences of trust behaviour on employees and organizations. Organizational leaders could
benefit from a greater awareness of which behavioural conditions enable the building of trust
as well as which conditions lead to distrust; in addition, employees could benefit from the
value of transformative leadership. Organizations could see an effect on their competitiveness
and performance if their leadership and work force have the capacity to incorporate trustinspired behaviours into their everyday working lives (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Kramer, 1999;
Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998; Six, 2005; Tyler & Degoey,
1996).
It is indisputable that globalization and technology have accelerated the pace of change
and the need for organizational transitions. Organizational change literature suggests that an
interdependent approach among social science and management would better reflect the
complexity of contemporary organizational life. Change management literature suggests that as
management enables the growth of trust and the repair of broken trust, there could be a positive

<-----Page 17----->7
effect on workplace satisfaction, performance, and the capacity to adapt to change. Exploring
how trust relates to an organization's capacity for change can have interesting consequences on
the quality of working life and workplace productivity, yet there has not been much
exploration of variables that influence the effectiveness and permanency of change (BijlsmaFrankema & Koopman, 2003; Bijlsma-Frankema & van de Bunt, 2003; Dirks & Ferrin, 2001;
Mayer & Gavin, 2005; Meyer & Stensaker, 2006; Pettigrew, Woodman, & Cameron, 2001;
Tyler, 2003; Weick & Quinn, 1999; Zeffane & Connell, 2003a, 2003b).

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW

Introduction
There has been an explosion of interest in the topic of trust over the last two decades.
The literature emerging from this research focus is extensive, and covers many layers of
analysis. The concept of trust has generated many interpretations, within many fields of
research: sociology, psychology, economics, political science, anthropology, and even biology.
A number of journals have devoted full issues to trust; these include the Academy of
Management Review, 23 (3); Personnel Review, 32 (5); Group & Organization
Management, 32 (4); Organization Science, 14 (1); Journal of Managerial Psychology, 19 (6);
International Journal of Human Resource Management, 14 (I); European Journal of
Marketing, 41 (9/10), and Business Ethics Quarterly, 8 (2). The January 2009 Academy of
Management Review has several articles dedicated to trust. A number of books on research in
trust and related academic topics have been written; in addition, a series of nine books on trust
have been published by the Russell Sage Foundation. Over 156 doctoral dissertations and
masters theses address the topic of trust. At least 13 trust measurement tools have been
recognized academically.
The literature on trust is varied and complex, and interpretations of trust are
furthermore influenced by the culture from which they emanate. There are two streams of
literature and research on trust: From North America, the research is largely empirical and
interpreted through a psychological lens, while European academics are more conceptual and
driven by theory (Bachmann & Zaheer, 2006a; Mollering, Bachmann, & Lee, 2004).

<-----Page 19----->9
In a world of constant change, a well-used cliche suggests the only constant we can be
certain to experience, is change. Since the act of trust is an adaptive response to personal,
organizational, or societal impulses, studying the relationship between trust and capacity for
change could provide helpful information and new knowledge on how these two phenomena
interact.
This chapter provides a review of the research on trust and capacity for change, and
explores how these are related. I explore the notion of trust, and how it is understood according
to the varied epistemological lens through which it is viewed. Its mirror, the dark side, is also
examined. Finally, I address what is understood by capacity for change, and conclude this
chapter with a summary of the literature review.

What is Trust?
Given the many interpretations of trust, I found it helpful to understand trust dynamics
as a grammatical construct. Trust could be relationally positioned in different ways, just like in
a sentence, as a subject (the trustor), a verb (trust), and as a direct object (trustee). As such,
trust suggests a grammatical influence in establishing, advancing, and cementing a relationship
(McKnight & Chervany, 2001; Sheppard & Sherman, 1998). The literature reviewed ranges in
its conceptualization of trust, and addresses a number of combinations of this grammatical
construct. The definitions used to describe trust vary according to different contextual levels;
they range from the individual, to the organizational and the sociocultural. While some
literatures suggest keeping a clean demarcation among these boundaries, more recent literature
suggests it is fine to adapt definitions of trust that span many levels. By taking a multilevel
approach to trust, this concept can be more fully appreciated for the complex, relational, and
socially constructed phenomenon that it is (Currall & Inkpen, 2002; Macy, Moore, & Rosa,

<-----Page 20----->10
2007; Mollering et al, 2004; Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis, 2007). Nevertheless, the lack of a
universally accepted definition of trust, and obversely, distrust, makes it challenging to study
this topic and to adapt one model for its quantitative measurement (Bigley & Pearce, 1998;
Blois, 1999; Currrall & Judge, 1995; Ferrin, Cooper, Kim, & Dirks, 2007; Kramer, 1999;
Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Mollering et al, 2004; Schoorman et al, 2007).
Very early trust research was conceptual and stemmed from a causal, positivistic
consideration of human relations. There is frequent reference to the conceptual foundations
established by Rotter, who defined interpersonal trust as a behaviour: Trust is an "expectancy
held by an individual or a group that the word, promise, verbal or written statement of another
individual or group can be relied upon" (Rotter, 1967, p.651).
After this seminal work, further research on trust measurement, mostly in the conflict
resolution domain, developed subsequent trust measurement approaches mostly using
questionnaires. The trust variable was identified as having the highest correlation compared
with other scales developed to gauge faith in management (Cook & Wall, 1980). Mayer et al.
(1995) developed a model for the measurement of trust, providing a parsimonious variant
based on a synthesis of trust elements with which the trust literature generally concurred. Three
factors were isolated: ability, benevolence, and integrity, with propensity identified as a trait
leading to the generalized expectation about the trustworthiness of others. In a later update to
this model, Schoorman et al (2007) suggested that this model is statistically robust, and can be
applied to interpersonal, intergroup, or interorganizational levels of analysis. These authors say
there is potential to develop further the propensity to trust measure. The association of
generalized expectations of others is integrated in Rousseau's affirmation that there are two
necessary conditions for trust; these are risk and interdependence (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, &

<-----Page 21----->Camerer, 1998). A good portion of the recent trust literature makes reference to Rousseau's
definition of trust, which is "a psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of another"
(Rousseau et ah, 1998, p.395). This definition builds on an earlier one suggested by Mayer
et ah (1995), which is "the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another
party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the
trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party" (Mayer et ah, 1995,
p.712). The authors underline that trust does not imply just taking risk; rather, it is a
willingness to take risk. In making this choice to accept risk, there is greater confidence that
cooperation will override opportunism; in turn, the willingness to cooperate with the other,
increases (Das & Teng, 1998, 2001).
To understand why someone will have a greater or lesser amount of trust for another
requires considering the attributes of the trustee. The attributes most frequently cited that
enable trustworthiness are ability, benevolence, and integrity. Ability is defined as skills and
competencies that contribute to well-being; benevolence is the demonstration of genuine care
and concern, and integrity includes moral principles, values, and conduct (Mayer et ah, 1995;
Tomlinson & Mayer, In press). Trustworthiness is what enables trust, and trust is not
sustainable without trustworthiness (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003). In an organizational
context, trustworthiness is the set of confident, positive expectations that employees have of
their employer (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Observed trust is reflected in others; that is, as a
behavioural construct, trust-related attitudes, behaviours, and risk-taking are interactively
interpreted and can predict the other's trustworthiness perceptions around trust (Serva, Fuller,
& Mayer, 2005). Added to these models of trust is a greater appreciation of the impact of the

<-----Page 22----->12
social context within which trust develops. Third-party relationships that promote social
networking within organizations are considered important elements in another variation of the
trust model (Ferrin, Shah, & Dirks, 2006).
In responding to the various interpretations around trust, Mayer et al. (1995) suggest
that the confusion around trust is exacerbated because terms such as cooperation, confidence
and predictability have been used synonymously with trust. They argue these terms are distinct
and should be separated from the trust debates. While Mayer et al. 's interpretation of trust
resides within the context of individual psychology, Schoorman et al. (2007) integrate the
above considerations of trust as well as key historical antecedents to reinforce that, in the
context of a group or an organization, ability, benevolence, and integrity also contribute to trust
(Schoorman et al, 2007).
Since these considerations require some mental calculation as well as the precedence of
human experience, these various interpretations of trust are cognitive constructs grounded in a
psychological understanding of the person. To these approaches should be added research
which addresses how emotions affect trust; that is, how affective responses influence how
people evaluate their level of trust in another (G. R. Jones & George, 1998; M. Williams,
2001); how emotions and moods provide more information on experiencing trust (G. R. Jones
& George, 1998); how emotional states can have a moderating effect on trust (Dunn &
Schweitzer, 2005), and how emotional attachments can make a trustor take a risk not warranted
by available evidence (Weber, Malhotra, & Murnighan, 2005).
Added to this affective dimension of trust, is the consideration of ethics and the
intersection between trust and ethical behaviour in an organization (Hosmer, 1995). In the area
of business management, trust is considered an attribute and a conditional good (Wicks,

<-----Page 23----->13
Berman, & Jones, 1999). In a business marketplace environment, a subset of ethical principles
such as trust, trustworthiness, and cooperation, is recognized as adding to competitive
advantage (T. M. Jones, 1995).

Trust as a Sociological Construct
Since interpersonal trust cannot happen without a relationship with another person,
group or organization, it is associated with human interaction in various contexts; that is,
within an organization, in society, and as an experience of psychological propensities. In this
context, I consider trust to be a sociological construct. To support this understanding, I explore
how trust is lived as rational choice, a relational construct, and as a psychological state of
being.

Trust as Rational Choice
Using sociological, economic and political theory as a foundation, trust has been
positioned with conviction, in organizational science, as an act of rational choice (Coleman,
1990; Hardin, 2002). Trust is associated with risk-taking, the latter being a recent notion
developed when people stopped thinking that the consequence of human acts was the result of
some sort of cosmic punishment or magic. Within this frame, trust is achieved in a familiar
world; it requires a previous engagement and presupposes a situation of risk. Trust, then
confirms the validity of prior experience, adds familiarity to life and enhances social order
(Luhmann, 1988). When time is involved between transactions, there is a consideration of risk
involved in that there is an acceptance of the risk that the other party may not respond with a
good. The importance of taking a risk in the act of trust is reinforced by suggesting that this
acceptance of risk is trust (Coleman, 1990).

The concept of trust as a calculated action is reflected in Gambetta's approach by
suggesting that "trust, or, symmetrically, distrust is a particular level of the subjective
probability with which an agent assesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a
particular action, both before he can monitor such action or independently of his capacity ever
to be able to monitor it and in a context in which it affects his own action" (Gambetta, 1988,
p.217).
Prisoner's dilemma games, laboratory experiments, money games, and hostage posting
provide information on the conditions in which individuals are willing to trust, based on
calculations of self-interest that drive rational choice. These bargaining games and experiments
show that people have different dispositions to trust. These dispositions could also be
influenced by other variables, such as peoples' beliefs about human nature, expectations of
reciprocal behaviour (Garfinkel, 1963; Good, 1988; Song, 2007; B. Williams, 1988), the need
to cooperate for the benefit and mutual assurance of many (Buchan, Croson, & Dawes, 2002;
Dirks & Ferrin, 2001, 2002; Yamagishi, Kanazawa, Mashima, & Terai, 2005), and in binding
the trustee by reducing incentives for violating trust (Raub, 2004). One approach is that the
origins of such dispositional trust come from general beliefs drawn from early trust-related
experiences (Rotter, 1971), to become, in time, a more stable personality characteristic and a
routine. In the new field of neuroeconomics, rational choice is more than cognitive; it is also
physiological in that the release of the pleasure hormone oxytocin was noted when a signal of
trust was demonstrated in laboratory games involving money. Researchers in this area
conclude that the human need for social relation based on trust is beyond the pale of the
calculative and rational; trust is part of our cellular essence, and that experience can be

<-----Page 25----->15
measured chemically (Damasio, 2005; Korsfeld, Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2005;
Zak & Fakhar, 2006; Zak, Kurzban, & Matzner, 2004).
According to some critics, individual differences measured in trust games have not had
much research purchase, except to develop measurements for screening and choosing
presumed trustworthy employees (Kipnis, 1996). Rational trust includes the notion of
encapsulated trust which is based on the knowledge that enables a person to trust another, and
the incentives of the trustee to fulfill that trust. Self-interest induces the trustor to live up to the
expectations of the trustee, thus making the trust, "encapsulated" (Hardin, 2002). In contrast,
trust as an act of "radical uncertainty" suggests that rationality is more than an act of selfinterested calculation (Nooteboom, 2002).
Role-based trust comes from the position that one occupies in an organization; one's
place in an organizational hierarchy accords that person trust, making this trust impersonal
because it is not necessarily based on a psychological disposition. There is the expectation that
an anticipated action will be performed competently, when a role is clearly identified, such as
in the case of authority figures like police, or in the technically demanding profession of
medicine. In this context, then, role-based trust is seen as an act of rational choice because it
confirms the expected social order and an acceptance of risk. Fiduciary trust is based on the
technical competency and the expectations that the person occupying a role will fulfill them.
So, without knowing much about a person, role-based trust suggests that role occupancy
outlines the intent to fulfill fiduciary expectations, with the technical competence that this will
happen. Trust, as a technical competence and fiduciary obligation, then, has the function of
social control, and could be enhanced by laws and other regulatory systems such as
professional associations. The idea of trust legitimized by virtue of a role occupied in an

<-----Page 26----->16
organizational system can reduce uncertainty around the role occupant's intent and
competence, and facilitate choice. For example, clear roles were found to be most beneficial in
temporary work arrangements with the development of "swift trust" where teams are put
together expediently for a specific task and have to cooperate quickly in order to function
(Barber, 1983; Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996).
Some conditions for attributing trustworthiness to authority have been identified; these
include perceived integrity, motives, consistency, openness, discreteness, functional
competence, interpersonal competence, and decision-making judgment (Gabarro, 1978). In
similar fashion, subordinates judge trustworthiness in managers according to perceived
availability, competence, consistency, fairness, integrity, loyalty, openness, overall trust,
promise fulfillment, receptivity, and attention to personal and professional development
(Butler, 1991; McCauley & Kuhnert, 1992).
Procedural trust, meaning there are procedures that are structurally and interactionally
fair, are seen to enhance trust in organizations. When employees trust organizational
authorities, trust is shown to mitigate the effects of unfavourable organizational decisions, such
as downsizing. By being trusted, managers are better able to explain the reasons for difficult
actions related to the need for organizational change. With enhanced sense-making, employees
are more likely to support unfavourable organizational decisions required to implement change
(Brockner & Seigel, 1996; Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997). For example,
earlier research shows that if survivors of downsizing have trust, it is entirely possible they will
believe that managers were implementing layoff decisions in the best interests of the
organization. If there is little or no trust, survivors might believe that management is putting its
own welfare ahead of the organization (Kotter &. Schlesinger, 1979).

<-----Page 27----->17
Within the organizational trust context, roles are seen as emergent and malleable, and
they can therefore influence the placement of trust in an organization. For trust to emerge,
individual discretion is critical; in a boundary-spanning function, role autonomy and the
exercising of individual discretion makes agents free from constraints that limit their ability to
interpret their boundary-spanning roles. It allows for the exercise of discretion so that
underlying motives and intentions are revealed (Perrone, Zaheer, & McEvily, 2003). With
transparency, trust is increased as subordinates are given greater autonomy; more trusting
relationships within an organizational context improve the quality of exchanges between
leaders and members (Douglas & Zivnuska, 2008). Managers have to trust their employees
before they can empower them (Mayer et ah, 1995); employees who are trusted can then focus
their attention on value-producing activities (Mayer & Gavin, 2005).
A stream of research in the field of leader-member-exchange confirms that managers
who trust their employees enhance employee empowerment (Gomez & Rosen, 2001).
Likewise, employee empowerment enables a higher degree of interpersonal trust in managers
(Moye & Henkin, 2006). Developing and enabling trust has been found to be a driving
motivator for leaders in the United States (Brower, Schoorman, & Tan, 2000). Human resource
managers, policies, and activities can play an important moderating role in enabling
organizational trust by encouraging open organizational communication practices, establishing
a procedural justice system, and employee development to enable and maintain a culture of
employee empowerment (Tzafrir, Harel, Baruch, & Dolan, 2004). Organizational justice, with
reference to fairness of workplace outcomes, was highlighted as the strongest predictor of
organizational and managerial trust (Hubbell & Chory-Assad, 2005); this differs from
interactional justice, which affects trust in supervisors. These types of justice-based trust

<-----Page 28----->18
relationships are different by virtue of the relational ties established within an organization, and
with a supervisor. These forms of trust experiences suggest different relational consequences
(Stinglhamber, De Cremer, & Mercken, 2006).
An interesting supplement to this is the emerging role of third-party "trust facilitators,"
who help to reconstruct trust in cluster environments where trust has been weakened. It is
acknowledged, however, that trust reconstruction is a recent research interest and is perhaps
more pertinent to the domain of conflict resolution (Mesquita, 2007).
As has been seen, several researchers have isolated the use of rational choice in trust
situations; the advantage to this approach is that choice offers observable behaviour from
which to extrapolate empirical and theoretical implications (Kramer & Tyler, 1996). In contrast
to this perspective on trust as an act of rational choice, a limited stream of literature suggests
that acts of trust can be irrational despite evidence of great risk; such acts of "irrational trust"
can be very important to the development of trust. In some cultural contexts, rational choice
according to calculated risk assessment is simply not appropriate (McKnight, Cummings, &
Chervany, 1998; Uzzi, 1997).
Literature on behavioural decision-making also says that many of the assumptions of
rational choice models are empirically untenable. Furthermore, the rationality of choice is too
cognitive, not taking sufficiently into account emotional and social influences on trust
decisions (Kramer, 1999). In contrast to trust as rational choice, trust is also positioned as
much a condition as an outcome of action; from a state of expectation of either favourable trust
or distrust, the ensuing experience provides the grounding for an interpretation of the
experience. Suspending the unknowable is what could then enable that final "leap of trust"
(Mollering, 2001a, 2001b; Sydow, 2006).

<-----Page 29----->19
Trust as a Relational Construct
Responding to these critiques, literature has emerged that incorporates better the social
and relational motives for trust-related choices. Within this stream, trust is more than a
calculation of risk; it is a social orientation (Mayer et al, 1995; McAllister, 1995; Tyler &
Degoey, 1996).
Interest in relational trust was further stimulated by research at macro-level structures
which include trust within networks and governance systems, and public and private sectors;
trust within and between organizations, and among alliances (Burt & Knez, 1995; Coleman,
1990; Inkpen & Currall, 2004; Kollok, 1994; Pate, Beaumont, & Stewart, 2007; Pechtold,
2005; Powell, 1996; Van de Walle, Van Roosbroek, & Bouckaert, 2008). On a broad, societal
level, trust has been recognized as a networking element in the building of social capital and
social functioning, and a factor in the emergence of democratic social structures (Coleman,
1990; Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam, 1995a; Sztompka, 1999; Vidal, 2006; Zucker, 1986), and a
key enabler of a market economy (Covey, 2006; Dasgupta, 1988; Kay, 1996). Trust and
trustworthiness help develop knowledge networks and are linked to the survival of
organizations (Abrams, Cross, Lesser, & Levin, 2003; Chowdhury, 2005; Chua, Ingram, &
Morris, 2008; Szulanski, Cappetta, & Jensen, 2004).
A large selection of literature looks at how trust is intricately linked to organizational
performance, business competitiveness, marketing and sales, industrial relationships,
negotiations, and even product development and corporate branding within organizations and
in inter-organizational contexts (Barney & Hansen, 1994; Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Hwee,
2000; Dittmar & Jennings, 2007; Doney, Barry, & Abratt, 2007; Durkin, 2007; P. Hurley &
Siebers, 2007; Hyun-Jung, 2004; Izquierdo & Cillan, 2004; G. R. Jones & George, 1998;

<-----Page 30----->Kingshott & Pecotich, 2007; Koeszegi, 2004; Massey & Dawes, 2007; Massey & Kyriazis,
2007; Mouzas, Henneberg, & Naude, 2007; Rodriguez, Perez, & Gutierrez, 2007; Rosell &
Yankelovich, 2003; Rus & Iglic, 2005; Sichtmann, 2007; Whipple, 2006).
Research shows that trust is considered a key enabler in the development and
maturation of joint business ventures (Inkpen & Currall, 2004), yet could become a
paradoxical concept in the context of culturally challenging business dynamics such as those
that exist in cultures such as in Japan. This country's business culture provides a setting where
the interplay between trust and duplicity is consistent dynamics which makes it challenging for
people not of this culture to understand (S. Johnston & Selsky, 2006). The impact of cultural
complexity on trust is also evident in Israel and Jordan where trust is lived and experienced
according to the social repertoire of charged political environments (Mizrachi, Drori, &
Anspach, 2007). Along this line, while trust advances business partnerships, some measure of
distrust is suggested as being just as important because it could be appropriate to the specific
cultural dynamics of given societies. In addition to cultural proclivities, then, in the event of a
partnership failure, sanctioning measures and the threat of adverse publicity can provide
mitigating safeguards (Sullivan, 2007).
A model addressing the impact of national culture on trust in business contexts was
presented by Doney, Cannon, & Mullen (1998). This model describes five cognitive trustbuilding processes explaining how trust is developed. Trust could be influenced by a
calculative process based on behavioural control; it could be formed by a prediction process
based on consistency; it could develop from an intentionality process where trustors and
trustees share values and beliefs; it could be formed by a capability process based on

<-----Page 31----->21
competence, ability, or expertise; and finally, trust could be a reciprocal dynamic in that the
trustworthiness of a trustee reinforces the trust of the trustor.
Relational signalling theory suggests that human behaviour is goal directed and context
dependent. A heightened awareness of self and context enables trust and trusting relationships.
According to this perspective, stable, normalizing frames are the goal; empirical research
suggests that taking a reflexive, learning approach to trust has an impact on behaviours. At the
organizational level, norms, values, and socializing efforts help develop organizational trust
(Six, 2005). In a professional relationship context, establishing trusting relations with trustees
suggests that taking a reflexive, deep awareness of self, and living acts of competence, caring,
and respect help assure the trustee that the trustor will behave in an expected way (Behnia,
2004).
Within the domain of psychology, relational trust is explored within cognitive,
motivational, and affective parameters of study (Shapiro, Sheppard, & Chearskin, 1992). In
social psychology, social identity and context are used to conceptualize relational trust (Barney
& Hansen, 1994; Kramer & Tyler, 1996; Wekselberg, 1996), and group value models (Tyler &
Degoey, 1996). In considering trust as a relational construct, these models emphasize the social
influences of trust behaviour, including self-presentational concerns and identity-related needs.
Effective organizations cultivate personal relationships that are trusting. Since intention and
choice play a role in devising a socially constructed interaction, consideration is a concept that
is suggested to be central to trust formation and maintenance (Nugent, 2006). In taking this
perspective, trust as a social construct suggests that organizations can be structured to reinforce
cooperative behaviours that reward and reinforce trust (Kramer, 1999,2001). When
cooperative behaviours are enhanced through ability, benevolence, and integrity, and when

<-----Page 32----->22
these behavioural elements are incorporated into management appraisal systems, these have
been shown to have an important mediating effect resulting in a greater trust for senior
management (Mayer & Davis, 1999).
There is a stream of literature that looks at the relationship between trust and control,
and control insofar as it is enacted by a contractual arrangement. The social context within
which a contract is established will largely determine the nature of the relationship with the
need for formal control, the contract, and trust. While the literature exploring trust and control
is inconclusive in terms of a causal relationship between the two (Costa & Bijlsma-Frankema,
2007; Lane, 1998), other studies exploring the effect of a contract on trust suggest that the
reasons for a contract and some other measure of formal control could be to deter risk, enhance
coordination, safeguard for contingencies, and be a sign of mutual commitment among
alliances (Nooteboom, 1996, 2002; Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorderhaven, 1997; Sengun &
Wasti, 2007; Woolthuis, Hillebrande, & Nooteboom, 2005). There is a difference between
binding and non-binding contracts, the latter providing more of a basis from which to build
trust because the source is personal rather than institutional (Malhotra & Murnighan, 2002). At
issue is the right form of managerial control, and how a manager can influence trustworthy
behaviour by encouraging employee participation and engaging in two-way communication
(Weibel, 2007). From a socially constructed perspective, the question of causality between
trust and control is not an issue; rather, what is important is how trust and control are enacted
and carried out in a socially constructed reality where both trust and control are expressed as a
duality that is inseparable (Mollering, 2005; Reed, 2001). According to this thinking, the early
stage of relational cooperation provides a good indicator of how trust, or distrust, will develop
(Vlaar, Van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2007).

<-----Page 33----->23

The quality of communication enhances social interaction; within an organization, good
communication influences employee commitment. Research on the relationship between
interpersonal communication skills and employee commitment suggests that the clarity of
messages and consistency in delivery are the most important factors in gaining employee
commitment that engenders trust (Bambacas & Patrickson, 2008). Trust is the outcome of good
organizational communication behaviours that explain decisions and demonstrate sincerity and
openness (Elsbach & Elofson, 2000; Roberts & O'Reilly, 1974). Good communication can also
provide the experiential context for five trust dimensions in an organization: competence,
openness, concern, reliability, and identification (Shockley-Zalabak, 2000; Shockley-Zalabak,
Ellis, & Cesaria, 2000a; Shockley-Zalabak, Ellis, & Winograd, 2000b).
In focussing on open communication and concern for employees, or benevolence, a
study of credit union employees suggested that when employees disagreed with their
managers, managers were perceived to be less responsible for the disagreement when
communicating openly and showing concern (Korsgaard, Brodt, & Whitener, 2002). In two
studies looking at trust within specific banking sectors, research suggested that clear
information enhanced client satisfaction and trust, and resulted in greater customer loyalty
(Ball, Coelho, & Machas, 2003; Huang & Dastmalchian, 2004; Saparito, Chen, & Sapienza,
2004). Pearce (1973) says there is a distinction to be made between a cognitive state of trust
and trusting behaviours. Trust is enabled when the trustor is confident about the expectations
of the trustee, and has a choice about how much vulnerability to expose. Cognition is involved
when there is some knowledge about the choice of behaviour and an awareness of its
consequences.

<-----Page 34----->In another study, the identification of communication frequency as a moderating,
relational variable provided empirical evidence for the important role that communication
plays in developing trustworthiness. Context became the more important factor; that is, in
exhibiting trust toward individuals in an organization, relational context was shown to be more
important than individual dispositions (Becerra & Gupta, 2003). Studies in specific sectors on
the role of trust in enabling communication suggest that, in a high-risk work environment, trust
is not only important but vital in the area of occupational safety and in work areas with high
risk management, such as the hospital sector, and in areas prone to crisis. These studies also
point to the key role that open communication plays in enabling an atmosphere of trust
(Conchie & Donald, 2007; Jahansoozi, 2006). While a history of prior interaction may be a
factor in developing trust (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995; Shapiro et ah, 1992), recent studies
suggest there is a non-linear, complicated, and possibly contentious relationship between past
history and interorganizational trust (Blois, 1999; Nooteboom, 2002). Trust formation is a
complex phenomena influenced by organizational boundary spanners; if the relationship can
surpass its early stages which would include the first 2 to 4 years, then mutual attraction, levels
of relational similarity, and organizational familiarity could contribute to durable, trusting
relationships and the building of interorganizational alliances (Gulati, 1995; Gulati & Sytch,
2008).
The exploration of trust in complex institutional environments is the topic of a book
containing a series of essays exploring how trust is developed "under pressure." The series of
empirical studies in different and difficult contextual circumstances suggest that trust is
developed in order to create value; intangible sources of trust such as personal intuition and
shared excitement come to the fore, and the sharing of existing codified rules and systems all

<-----Page 35----->25
contribute to developing trust even in the most challenging organizational contexts (BijlsmaFrankema & Woolthuis, 2005b).
There is limited literature exploring the development of trust relationships in the virtual
world of the Internet, e-mail, and wireless devices in the context of a work environment. One
of the first studies on how technology affects trust explored the development of trust from
early to later uses of technology; this study suggested that trust increases with stages of
comfort in using the technology (Kipnis, 1996). More recent research on the impact of
technology on the development of trust in a virtual work environment suggests that trusting
relationships are possible but require more time than those that are built in person; furthermore,
responsiveness and the development of team identity in virtual work environments is vital in
enabling trust to grow and mature (Moustafa-Leonard, 2007; Ramo, 2004; Stewart, 2003;
Webster & Wong, 2008; Wilson, Strauss, & McEvily, 2006). Since globalization requires an
increasing use of distributed teams, when connecting geographically dispersed teams, it is
important to emphasize very early the building of trust in a work environment that enables
trustworthiness by providing lived experiences of benevolence, ability, and integrity. Once
built on solid relational foundations, such trust should endure despite the difficulties of crossfunctional and cross-cultural work environments (Zolin, Hinds, Fruchter, & Levitt, 2004).
However, in times of change, it was found that co-located teams experienced quicker drops in
trust than geographically distant teams (Zolin & Hinds, 2004). Third-party network facilitators
were shown to play a role in the development of trust in geographically distant work teams and
research suggests that as work becomes increasingly globalized, such facilitators could play an
important trust-bridging role (McEvily & Zaheer, 2004).

<-----Page 36----->26
While trust has been positioned through many lenses, whether understood as an attitude
or behaviour, in person or virtual, most literature acknowledges three common elements: Trust
is relational, and requires some element of risk in order to be experienced in social relations;
trust requires some degree of competence and may include the extension of benevolence and
good will; and lastly, lived as a spontaneous act, trust could be enacted as a leap of faith toward
favourable expectations.
Rational and relational perspectives on trust originate from different epistemologies,
which is why there is creative tension between the two approaches (Kramer, 1999). I find it
attractive to take an integral approach, and believe it could be more helpful to think of context,
and how both the rational and the relational approaches have an influence on trust behaviour.
We need to conceptualize organizational trust that includes calculations of multiple factors, as
well as some consideration of how social, situational, and institutional elements influence trust
(Lane, 1997; Lane & Bachmann, 2002). I concur with the suggestion that Hardin's three-part
relational approach on trust is promising in that it incorporates multiple research elements; that
is, the properties of a trustor, attributes of a trustee, and the specific context within which trust
is conferred (Kramer, 1999). It is this multiplex approach that I adopt in my research approach
for this dissertation.

A Psychological State of Being
Trust, considered from a psychological perspective, is defined in terms of several
related cognitive processes and orientations. Trust is a psychological state of being and is
achieved, shaped, and influenced through a number of psychological processes that are
influenced by and that integrate organizational and institutional forms (Rousseau et ah, 1998).
In a departure from the rational choice model, trust is considered a state of perceived

<-----Page 37----->27
vulnerability or risk derived from an individual's uncertainty regarding the motives, intentions,
and prospective actions of others on whom he or she depends (Kramer & Tyler, 1996). Trust
implies there is a risk of disappointment, but it also means that in order to trust, it is necessary
to take that risk (Boon & Holmes, 1991). In some cases, trust can be shown to develop quicker
by taking risks sooner and being vulnerable earlier in a relationship (Murnighan, Malhotra, &
Weber, 2004). Trust can also be the momentary state of an individual's mind (Currrall &
Judge, 1995). In that state, one has the choice to trust in a way that helps or harms the trustor
(Dasgupta, 1988). A risky situation may create the need for trust (Deutsch, 1958), and the act
of trusting may encourage the taking of risk (McAllister, 1995). In this vein, trust may be
considered a "risky course of action" (Lewis & Weigert, 1985). An accurate assessment of risk
in collaborative situations suggests that trust can be built slowly with small wins or more
quickly to enable collaborative advantage (Vangen & Huxham, 2003). Some suggest that trust
is the mirror image of risk, and that high trust is organizationally efficient because it suggests
low perceived risk (Das & Teng, 2004). In contrast, earlier research on the association between
trust and risk suggests that these two concepts should not be used interchangeably; the
phenomenon of trust should be reserved only for personal relations. According to this
perspective, interpersonal trust has no impact on organizational settings; it is considered
uniquely calculative and contextually appropriate for commercial relations only (Craswell,
1993; Williamson, 1993a, 1993b).
Trust may encompass a person's expectations, assumptions, or beliefs about the
likelihood that another's future actions will be beneficial, favourable, or at least not detrimental
to one's interests (Robinson, 1996). Trust stems from dispositional factors related to individual
predispositions toward trust, as well as situational factors that are contextual (Payne & Clark,

<-----Page 38----->28

2003). Trust can be character-based, and is shown to be predictive of job satisfaction;
alternatively, trust can be relationship-based, which is shown to be more indicative of job
performance (Dirks & Skarlicki, 2004).
One stream of research shows that the willingness of people to trust others and engage
in trusting behaviour can also be historically situated, and is a learned experience. The historic
interactions between and among people can either increase or diminish depending on the
quality of the interactions. Psychological safety, however, is recognized as a fundamental
requirement for trust; some suggest it is more appropriate to explore trust as a discovery
intervention with dyads rather than group settings (Edmondson, 2004; Roussin, 2008). In the
context of managerial relationships, high levels of trust are beneficial to an organization
especially when trust becomes a historically situated organizational experience (Senge,
Kleiner, Roberts, Ross, & Smith, 1994). Not only does trust help to develop quality
relationships between managers and employees, but also trust enhances organizational
problem-solving capabilities, and becomes a self-reinforcing spiral of trusting acts (Boyle &
Bonacich, 1970; Deutsch, 1958; Fisher, 1997; Lewicki & Bunker, 1995; Zand, 1972). The
reverberating effects of managerial trust include supervisory levels of management, as was
shown in a study of 545 middle managers in the nascent democracy of China. In an
increasingly global business world, Chinese managers were shown to be aware of the benefits
and costs of the practices of "guanxi" which favours nepotism, and the possibly negative
effects of such inauthentic practices on managerial trust (Chen, Chen, & Xin, 2004; Zhang,
Tsui, Song, Li, & Jia, 2008). A study on the restructuring of a major Chinese
telecommunication firm suggested that the building of affective trust in managers during

<-----Page 39----->29
restructuring enabled the organizational change to go more smoothly (Fryxell, Dooley, & Li,
2004).
Another stream of literature focuses on leadership behaviours that enhance trust. These
include consulting employees when taking decisions, communicating a collective vision, and
sharing common values with the organizational leader (Gillespie & Mann, 2004). Interactive
political skills enhance perceptions of interpersonal trust, and can even affect the formal
accountability standards within an organization (Ammeter, Douglas, Ferris, & Goka, 2004).
Such behaviours contribute to a feeling of psychological safety; if a leader is able to facilitate
such an environment, then possible outcomes could include expanding innovation, identifying
organizational decision errors, fixing operational problems, and working beyond the boundary
of job descriptions (Edmondson, 2004).
Gibb (1978) is a pioneer of experiential training in relational trust. He described a cycle
of fear and distrust that results in passive and conformist work environments, and countered
with an emotionally and cognitively holistic interpretation of trust that incorporates spirituality.
This approach was reintroduced more recently in studies looking at how to break the
destructive cycle of fear and distrust. Following this approach, it is suggested that leaders need
to place a high value on integrity and trust, and follow up by communicating sincerely and
behaving accordingly (R. W. Rogers & Riddle, 2006). In the increasingly more common
context of work across organizational boundaries, a more focussed threat regulation model was
recently presented that fosters trust and cooperation. Being mindful of emotional management
mitigates harm from opportunistic behaviour, identity damage, and the neglect of employee
interests (M. Williams, 2007).

<-----Page 40----->Relationally supportive leadership behaviours can create a sense of belonging between
leaders and their followers and can establish the foundation for enabling stewardship
behaviours in organizations. Stewardship, which incorporates a sense of personal
responsibility, can therefore permeate throughout an organization by lived leadership
behaviours that enable trust (Hernandez, 2008). The contextual permeability of trust is evident
at the worker level, where it is shown that beyond dispositional and demographic factors, trust
in fellow workers has the most significant influence on employee attitudes (Ferres, Connell, &
Travaglione, 2004). In order to be believable and therefore be trusted, leadership behaviours
must be congruent with actions. Congruency enhances perceptions of leader ability,
benevolence, and integrity, while relationship development influences the benevolence
dimension of trustworthiness (Caldwell & Hayes, 2006).
A contrary view to the importance of highly trusting personal relationships suggests
that these may become vehicles for personal indulgence if there is a blur between task and
personal objectives. According to this perspective, the organizational value of motive-based
trust could be put into question and trust-based managerial effectiveness may be challenged
(Atkinson, 2004; Atkinson & Butcher, 2003). A very high level of trust may inhibit selfmanaging teams from monitoring themselves; performance may suffer, and, in response to
conflict, these teams may become inefficient (Langfred, 2004,2007).
In their analysis of trust models, Dirks and Ferrin (2001) conclude that trust plays an
important role in predicting organizational behaviours especially in times of flux; if trust is
high, then adverse organizational decisions will be received easier than if trust is low. Under
conditions of low trust, organizational actions will more likely be interpreted negatively.
Recently, a comprehensive, multilevel model of trust in leadership has been developed to

<-----Page 41----->31
incorporate the most frequently cited trust definition based on the psychological elements of
ability, benevolence, and integrity. In this model, which is an update to the Mayer et al.
approach (1995), trust is positioned to have an effect on attitudes, perceptions, and behaviours.
Dirks and Ferrin (2001) operationalized their model with supporting actions. That is, setting
compelling direction and creating a supporting organizational structure enables ability;
sustaining a supportive organizational context and coaching indicates benevolence;
accountability, perceptions of justice, and value congruence enhance integrity. At the
individual level, the reputation of the trustee, as well as the trustor's propensity to trust,
attribution style, perceived risk tolerance, leader prototype, and prior history are influencing
factors. At the team level, moderating variables include the need for psychological safety and a
propensity to trust in groups; at the organizational level, culture plays a prominent role. These
elements have an impact on behaviour and affect. Some of the outcomes resulting from these
influencing factors can be quantified by performance, turnover, capacity to adapt, and degree
of perceived trust (Burke, Sims, Lazzara, & Salas, 2007; Child, 1998; Costigan, liter, &
Berman, 1998; R. F. Hurley, 2006; Kiffin-Petersen, 2004; McKenna & Maister, 2002).
In situations where interpersonal contact is not easy, proxies, or third-parties can be
used as substitutes for knowledge sources around trust (Creed & Miles, 1996; Zucker, 1986).
However, the source of such knowledge may be gossip, and the information derived from such
sources can be questionable and problematic (Burt & Knez, 1995).
A number of factors have been identified that influence the attribution of
trustworthiness. In the context of an organizational hierarchy, the recognition of membership
and a sense of belongingi benevolence, and perceived neutrality enable trustworthiness (Tyler
& Degoey, 1996). In a more general organizational context, trust has been highlighted as

<-----Page 42----->reducing transaction costs within organizations, and trust increases sociability and facilitates
deference to organizational authorities (Kramer, 1999). In the retail sector, a longitudinal study
of 88 stores showed that when employees believed they were trusted by management,
behaviours indicated an increase in sales, customer service performance, and greater workplace
responsibility (Salamon & Robinson, 2008). In the public sector, studies suggested there is a
clear relationship between employee work satisfaction and trust at the organizational and
executive levels (Pate et ah, 2007; Perry & Mankin, 2007). In organizational situations which
are politically charged, be they private or public, employees demonstrated work ethics beyond
what their roles defined when they perceived a high degree of trust coming from their
supervisors (Poon, 2006).
As has been seen from these multiple interpretations of trust, it is not surprising that
several authors suggest looking at trust as a much more complex, multidimensional
psychological state of being that incorporates beliefs, as well as affective and motivational
components (Bromiley & Cummings, 1966; Kramer, 1999; Kramer & Tyler, 1996; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995; Tyler & Degoey, 1996). As well, different contextual
situations influence the affective and cognitive sources of trust. It has been noted that trust
coming from individual sources varies from trust that is organizational or societal in nature.
Different forms of trust, such as relationship-based trust will have psychological premises that
differ from that of character-based trust; trust typologies that are integrity-based differ from
competency-based forms of trust (Bachmann & Zaheer, 2006b). In the context of dyadic
negotiation, it is suggested that affective trust will develop more rapidly than cognitive trust
(Olekalns & Smith, 2005). Regardless of relational context, the consensus from industry
consultants is that respect, fairness, and credible management practices are universal values-

<-----Page 43----->33
based practices that lead to the building of organizational trust (Great Place to Work Institute,
2008).

The Dark Side of Trust
The breach of trust is considered an act of breaking bonds with the other and a loss of
productive activity: It has been positioned as a relational breach between people, within groups
and organizations, and politically, at national levels (Fukuyama, 1995; Kramer, 1999; Lewicki
& Bunker, 1995,1996; Lewicki et al, 1998; Luhmann, 1988; Morrison & Robinson, 1997;
Putnam, 1995a, 1995b; Robinson, 1996). A stream of literature examines the very public loss
of trust in institutions because of the loss of trust in their competence and integrity (Barber,
1983; Pate et al, 2007), as well as loss of trust in entire social systems (Carnevale, 1995;
Coleman, 1990; Fukuyama, 1995; Luhmann, 1979; Putnam, 1995a). The cumulative effect of
broken trust is the lack of trust, with effects that are damaging and far ranging. Depending on
the level and depth of the trust relation, the consequences of a breach could range from a minor
misunderstanding to full-blown acts of war. Few researchers in the field of organizational
development have closely examined this darker side of trust, identified as suspicion, which is a
central cognitive component of distrust (Deutsch, 1958), and distrust, which is identified as the
lack of confidence in the other (Grovier, 1994). Early definitions of distrust suggest that it is
grounded in experience, where an expectation of the other is broken. A continued breach of
expectations, depending on their magnitude, could lead to affective responses that range from
mild annoyance to serious anger (Bunker & Rubin, 1995).
When an employee starts to work for an organization, there are expectations of a
psychological contract that include reciprocal obligations between the employee and the
organization. These reciprocal obligations reflect the sense of purpose in organizational

<-----Page 44----->34

activities, characteristics already recognized in very early literature on organizational
development (Barnard, 1968). However, when a promise to an employee is broken, or when
there is a cognitive misunderstanding, there is a violation of reciprocal employee-organization
obligations. Depending on the human investment in the trust relationship, the behavioural
consequences could range from disappointment to outright corporate sabotage; should the
breach extend into the affective state, it becomes an experience of violation (Morrison &
Robinson, 1997; Robinson, 1996).
Within the context of an organization, Lewicki and Bunker (1995) suggest there are
three types of trust: calculative, with a deterrent of contractual punishment; knowledge-based,
where bad information about the recipient is the deterrent; and identification-based trust, where
the affective pain of group exclusion deters breaches of trust. These authors suggest that trust
developments as well as breaches of trust are often linear, moving from the relatively large
personal distance of calculative trust, to the highly internalized, identification-based trust.
While the initial response to broken trust is cognitive, based on the type of cognition, emotions
are generally affected, and behaviours are subsequently modified. A breach of trust creates a
state of instability; if the personal investment in the relationship is not great, the affective
response is minimal, and the breach could be repaired through negotiation. In the case of
knowledge-based trust, the breach could result in changed ideas about the recipient, with the
serious consequence of someone's damaged reputation. The repair to such damage requires a
greater personal investment than a breach of calculative trust, because it requires serious
modification or correction to the information that was transmitted. However, because there is
prior knowledge based on prior repeated experiences, the trust may be easier to repair. That is,
the breach may be attributed to a bad day rather than imputations of dissonant behaviour. In the

<-----Page 45----->35

final instance of identification-based trust, a breach could be affectively traumatic with the
result of deeply destabilizing the values of the recipient. The effect here could be life-altering
and may result in profound personal changes for the recipient of the breached trust. In all cases
of broken trust, regardless of the depth of breach, there is a cost to the organization within
which the breach has occurred, a cost that could be measured in terms of damaged human
relations and diminished corporate productivity (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995, 1996; Lewicki
e* a/., 1998).
Laboratory findings on trust suggest that there is never a full recovery from the
damaging effects of deception (Schweitzer, Hershey, & Bradlow, 2006). In contrast to the
above, which are victim-based perspectives, the dynamics of trust violations from a
perpetrator's perspective suggest that the act of betraying trust is initially premeditated,
therefore cognitive and rational. A model of trust betrayal from the perpetrator's perspective
suggests that the betrayal comes from a violation of personal expectations in the trust
relationship; as such, the initial cognition of the trust betrayal can become affective, where
feelings of disappointment, anger, guilt, and shame toward the trustors can reinforce the
behaviour of betrayal. This model identifies three types of trust betrayal: premeditated,
accidental, and opportunistic (Elangovan & Shapiro, 1998). Examples of major corporate
events where an employee violated trust include the Barrings Bank collapse in Britain, the
Enron scandal in the United States, and the more recent Credit Foncier bank scandal in France.
The positive corollary to the dark side is how to repair trust, which is defined as the
partial or complete restoration of the willingness to be vulnerable following a decline of that
willingness (Tomlinson & Mayer, In press). Since cognition and affect is involved in trust,
repairing trust involves both, but in different measures, depending on the depth and nature of

<-----Page 46----->36
the breach, and the depth of emotion that had been triggered by the breach. Since trust is
relational, requiring more than one person for it to exist, the repair process involves some
action between the people involved. There are a number of logical steps that are suggested.
Repair happens more effectively if anger and fear are reduced before attempts are made to
repair the trust. As well, the type of repair depends on whether the process of repair involves
an initial failure or repeated violations, which are more difficult to repair. First, there must be
an awareness of the breach, and an awareness of which actions and behaviours contributed to
the breach, and an acknowledgement of the feeling that may have been provoked. Then, there
must be acknowledgement of the violation, and an understanding of what caused it. Following,
there must be personal admission of the breach, and some willingness to be responsible for the
repair. Finally, the recipient of the breach must be aligned with these actions and be willing to
contribute with concurrent responsibility, action, apology, and forgiveness (Reina & Reina,
2006b, 2007b). For competence-based violations, apologies are considered particularly
effective (Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, & Dirks, 2004); however, when integrity is lost, any mitigating
response to restore trust is better than the alternative (Kim, Dirks, Cooper, & Ferrin, 2006). It
is suggested that reticence and denial are inadequate responses to violations of competencebased trust; they are the least effective form of apology because they do not signal redemption
(Ferrin et ah, 2007). In contrast, substantive tactics to repair trust, such as penance and
regulation, are preferred to non-substantive tactics such as apologies (Dirks, Kim, Cooper, &
Ferrin, 2008).
During the process of trust repair, professional support could enable a smooth transition
from each stage of the trust repair process. To maintain this process, good organizational
communication enables clarity and decreases incongruence which could be the source of

<-----Page 47----->37
misunderstanding. Employee vigilance regarding organizational obligations could highlight
unmet promises as well as help to assure that corporate values and beliefs are respected and
maintained. Communication techniques leading to transparency and openness of information
are shown to enhance trust at the level of the dyad; group, and the organization (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Reina & Reina, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b;
Tomlinson & Mayer, In press; C. C. Williams, 2005).
A more recent, four-stage trust repair model has been proposed that takes a systemic,
congruent, and multilevel approach. Gillespie and Dietz (2008) state that a critical first stage
involves timely and credible communication to employees or stakeholders. Supporting the
urgency of communication is the understanding that clear communication reveals one's risks
and commitments and can deter misattributions; accuracy and transparency in communication
are key elements in trust repair (Korsgaard et al, 2002; Weber et al, 2005). The next stage
requires a systemic diagnosis of the failure and what needs to be done to repair and restore
trust. Accuracy, transparency, and timeliness influence the effectiveness of this diagnosis. The
third stage requires reforming interventions supported by post-diagnostic communication
tactics and trust repair mechanisms. Lastly, post-implementation evaluations assess the
effectiveness of the interventions and suggest corrective measures (Gillespie & Dietz, 2008).
In addition to formal trust repair strategies, social accounts may also help enable the
trust repair process by clarifying judgements about the reasons for the breach and attributions
to the trustor or trustee for the breach (Kim et al, 2006; Schweitzer et al, 2006; Tomlinson &
Mayer, In press).
Following a trust violation, punishment and regulation of the transgressor are additional
effective measures to increase trust (Dirks, Kim, Cooper, & Ferrin, 2005). In studying the

<-----Page 48----->38
transformation of trust into distrust during a merger, findings suggested that active
management of relationships with merger survivors is required to preserve organizational trust
and to counter the negative effects of disgruntled merger victims. Merger survivors who trust
management can facilitate goal-centered, constructive responses. Those who distrust
management may focus their energies on destructive actions and antisocial organizational
behaviours (Ozag, 2006; Searle & Ball, 2004; Thau, Crossley, Bennett, & Sczesny, 2007).
Organizational justice theory, which looks at perceptions of fairness and how these are
linked to expectations, interactions, and outcomes, offers a multifaceted and multidimensional
approach to study the complexity of mistrust and trust, and how the two merge and disengage
in a relational context (Saunders & Thornhill, 2003, 2004). Other research suggests that using
legalistic mechanisms to instill trust will not work when interpersonal trust is lacking. The
control paradox suggests that the more leaders try to control their subordinates, the less
productive the team will be (Miller, 2004).
A contrary perspective says that some control mechanisms may have an effect on
restoring task-related, competent performance but may not have an effect on renewing valuesbased trust (Sitkin & Roth, 1993). The notion that increased regulation does not necessarily
have the effect of renewing trust was supported by an empirical study of an ISO 9000
certification process of a company in Germany. Findings indicated that certification, as an
attempt to institutionalize quality systems to enable institutionalized trust, failed to have a
positive effect on developing organizational trust (Walgenbach, 2001). In contrast, from a
consumer's perspective, introducing monitoring and sanctions helped restore perceived
institutional trustworthiness in another study (Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005). In any case, with
the rise of corporate scandals and failures, and the extent of loss of trust in leadership, knowing

<-----Page 49----->39
how to repair trust has been identified as a critical management competency (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996).

Trust and Organizational Capacity for Change
In this section of the literature review I highlight those publications that describe
specifically how organizational change is related to trust, and how the quality of trust can
influence an organization's capacity for change.
While there is no commonly accepted definition of capacity for change, this notion
incorporates the development of change and operational capabilities that sustain long-term
performance. Organizations, as they cope with change, innovation, and renewal, need to
incorporate their existing capabilities into these processes. Organizations with a capacity for
change have the required resources and capabilities to implement the change. Trust is one of
these capabilities. With trust, members of an organization can be cognizant of the need for
change, even if they may not like the change. Knowing of the change enables and maintains
trust in management and suggests a greater probability of long-term performance (Meyer &
Stensaker, 2006). However, organizational capacity for change not only incorporates formal
management systems, but also more informal organizational elements such as relational
capital. The literature on capacity for change identifies eight dimensions required for the
successful implementation of organizational change strategies. Two of these, trust in leadership
and trusting followers, clearly identify trust as a capacity for change enabler (Judge, Bowler, &
Douglas, 2006).
Only recently has the literature started to address the psychological processes involved
in organizational change. In a study focussing on the experiences of employees undergoing
change, three change process characteristics have been identified that can mediate resistance to

<-----Page 50----->change; these are good information, participation, and trust in management (van Dam, Oreg, &
Schyns, 2008). The latter characteristic has been identified as a prerequisite for employee
cooperation in the change process. Employees must have trust in management's integrity and
reliability; otherwise, fear and resistance may obviate the change process (Kotter, 1995; Kotter
& Schlesinger, 1979).
Perceptions of organizational change can trigger a number of cognitive and affective
responses, which can range from positive, negative, neutral, to mixed. In turn, cognitive and
affective responses to an organizational situation can have an effect on behaviours; therefore,
how change is perceived can have an effect on behaviours within an organization undergoing
change, and the capacity of that organization to carry out the change. An important variable
within the change process is the perceived trustworthiness of the change manager; perceptions
of trustworthiness will influence how employees respond to change (Smollan, 2006). It is
suggested that behavioural change most often occurs at the action stage of change, which
follows the planning stage of change (Cunningham et al., 2002).
The action of change creates an atmosphere of uncertainty in an organization. It is at
this moment that organizational trust in management is very important. Managerial actions
during this early stage of change can either reinforce trust, or destroy it, depending on which
behaviours are exhibited during this time of organizational instability. Lack of trust between
employees and managers can make it difficult to understand the need for change, and can lead
to misunderstanding and resistance to the change. Therefore, the effectiveness with which
managerial trust is perceived depends on the change experiences that provide the source for
trust experiences. How the change is carried out influences the degree to which change
recipients have trust in management (Kotter & Schlesinger, 1979; Lines et al, 2005).

<-----Page 51----->41
In a study on major restructuring efforts following the Asian financial crisis at the start
of this century, findings indicated that during this period of uncertainty, there was a positive
relationship between work satisfaction and the successful implementation of structural
changes. Empathy shown by organizational change leaders enabled the development of trust
and cultivated support for the organizational change strategies that were carried out (Lee &
Teo, 2005).
It has been shown that properly communicating change to employees is paramount,
otherwise the dynamics of external environmental pressures may increase employees' feelings
of mistrust relative to organizational change decisions (Saunders & Thornhill, 2003, 2004).
The readiness of an organization for change, and by inference, its capacity for change, is
largely influenced by the change message and the credibility of the change agents, which range
from the head of an organization down to the level of group member. Change agents are
therefore any members of an organization who are in leadership positions; they will have an
effect on how the change is carried out throughout the organization. Their behaviour will
influence how the change effort is perceived by change recipients. If a change agent intervenes
in a manner considered to be positive by change recipients, then the change effort is more
easily incorporated into the organization (Armenakis et ah, 1999).
Some of the key attributes that influence the effectiveness of a change agent's
behaviour include trustworthiness, sincerity, and expertise (Armenakis & Mossholder, 1993).
Not only are personal attributes important to the success of a change effort, but also the manner
in which this effort is communicated. Communicating a consistently clear change message
shapes the reactions of change recipients to the change effort. Clarity in communicating the

<-----Page 52----->42
change message reinforces the change agent's credibility and capacity to influence how the
change process is perceived (Armenakis & Harris, 2002).
Since organizational change is initiated and carried out by individual members of that
organization, collective change activities are the sum of individual member activities (Holt,
Armenakis, Feild, & Harris, 2007). In this context, it is appropriate to carry out a survey of
individual members in order to gauge an organization's capacity for change. Armenakis et al.
(2007) developed an Organizational Change Recipients' Beliefs Scale to understand better the
readiness of an organization to carry out change, the state of the change effort, and indicators
to help encourage support for a change process. This scale identifies beliefs, which are a
precursor to behaviour. Since the behaviour of change agents is critical in forming perceptions
that are either positive or contrary to the change effort, the scale provides information that can
be used to modify the behaviour of change agents in order to enable successful organizational
change.
The five domains identified in this scale are:
•

Discrepancy, which explores perceptions regarding the need for change;

•

Appropriateness, which seeks to determine whether the change interventions are the
right ones needed to address the discrepancy;

•

Efficacy, which examines whether there is the capacity to carry out the new
behaviours needed for the change;

•

Principal support, which gauges the perceived support of change agents for the
change effort; and

•

Valence, which examines the degree to which the change is perceived to be
attractive by change recipients.

<-----Page 53----->In the fast-paced, competitive global economy which is our present reality, trust
becomes closely related to an organization's ability to adapt to a continually changing external
environment. Pressured to compete, organizations are required to maintain a high level of
performance in order to survive in a global, competitive marketplace. Trust enables high
performance by promoting good communication practices and reinforcing organizational
competence. Trust is sustained and maintained by the belief that expectations of performance
will be met. Low trust inhibits the capacity for an organization to adapt, and may even hinder
its survival. High trust enables efficient operations and increases organizational potential
(Dervitsiotis, 2006). In sum, the change literature clearly suggests there is an important
relationship between trust and an organization's capacity for change.

Summary
Trust has been shown to be a complicated notion that becomes meaningful in a
relational context. It has many interpretations and ways of being lived. It stems from rational,
cognitive, and affective sources of being, and is expressed and lived through behaviour. Trust
is influenced by culture, history, and the society within which it derives meaning. While there
is a dark side to trust, there is light in knowing that broken trust can be repaired.
With the increasing compression of time, space, and place, trust has been shown to be
intimately related to an organization's capacity to adapt (Lines et al, 2005). Change creates a
space of instability that illuminated management could seize as an opportunity to renew,
reinforce, and repair trust. By understanding the meaning of trust, leaders involved in
organizational relationships could appreciate that working harder to develop trusting
relationships would indeed reduce ambiguity in the face of uncertainty (Ring & Van de Ven,
1992, 1994).

CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Introduction
This chapter describes the research concept and design, the research field and
participants, instrumentation, survey process and security, the pilot results, and other related
processes. The approach uses instrumentation developed by the Reina Trust Building Institute
to measure organizational trust, and capacity for change developed by Armenakis et al. (2007).
The first approach uses elements already tested by Mendoza (2001) and Seely-Troiano (2005).
The capacity for change instrument complements a study that developed a readiness for
organizational change scale by Holt (2002).
To test the survey process and content, a pilot was conducted with six participants; four
of these completed and responded with comments. There was no issue with the survey process
as identified by the pilot participants; the only substantive content issue was the need to define
what is meant by "change."

Research Concept and Design
The research suggests that the trust topic is complex and a commonly accepted
definition of trust does not exist. Trust, being a phenomenon of relatively recent academic
interest, offers many research opportunities to explore. Trust is intimately linked to the ability
of an organization to adapt to internal as well as external pressures; the literature suggests that
the trust process and capacity for change are related. In using holding to emphasize ideas, it is
said that:

<-----Page 55----->45

•

"In an organizational context, do certain structures, processes or incentives fundamentally
alter the degree to which individuals rely on group identity as a heuristic for formulating
initial trust impressions? ... We would also want to gain insight into whether group
identity as a basis for trust can be actively managed, produced or discouraged"
(McEvily, Weber, Bicchieri, & Ho, 2006, p.65).

•

"By linking trust to communication and meaning, we can start to identify the means to
build trust, even in situations where new and diverse partners are brought together" (Hardy,
Phillips, & Lawrence, 1998 p. 83).

•

"Although several well-developed and psychometrically validated scales now exist for
measuring trust, virtually no empirical studies use standard scales" (McEvily & Zaheer,
2006, p.295).

•

"Although the call for developing and sustaining these [trust] relationships has been strong,
there has been very little research on the process of developing and maintaining these
relationships. We need to know far more about how such relationships are created and
maintained if we are to help people sustain strong and effective collaboration"(Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996, pp.136-137).

•

"Organizational change represents one class of events where trust can be produced or
destroyed, depending on how the change process is structured" (Lines et ah, 2005,
pp.240-241).
The vast majority of empirical trust studies were carried out in companies located in the

United States, France, and Germany (Bachmann, 2006). My research indicates there have been
no significant trust studies done on major Canadian telecommunication companies.

<-----Page 56----->46
There are a number of ontological perspectives on trust. These are viewed according to
three levels of analysis: societal, organizational and interpersonal. Cognitive and affective
elements contribute to a set of trust behaviours, which range from early, Skinnerian approaches
to measurable trust based on psychological dispositions (Rotter, 1967, 1970, 1980) to betterdefined cognitive and affective indicators that can be observed through human relationships.
These indicators include competence, integrity, benevolence, and predictive behaviour
(Bachmann, 2006; Kramer, 2006; Mayer et ah, 1995; Schoorman et al, 2007).
Figure 1 outlines my conceptual understanding of the research approach. The definition
of trust that guides my research is based on a transactional approach, understanding that trust is
relational and influenced by human behaviour.

Figure 1. Research model - Trust and capacity for change.
The transactional approach incorporates a heuristic of 16 trust behaviours, which are
built on early, as well as recent interpretations of trust, as described in chapter 2. The 16

<-----Page 57----->behaviours are grouped according to contractual, communication, and competence trust
behaviours (Reina & Reina, 2006a).
A similar ontological, behavioural lens is used in this transactional approach to explore
capacity for change. The capacity for change survey complements a dissertation by Holt (2002)
where he developed an organizational change recipients' readiness scale. The capacity for
change survey identifies five measurable behaviours that contribute to an organization's
capacity for change; these are discrepancy, appropriateness, efficacy, principal support, and
valence (Armenakis et al, 2007). In taking a parsimonious approach, I consolidated these five
behaviours into one variable, capacity for change.
According to the capacity for change literature, trust is a key enabler of organizational
change (Lines et al, 2005). Therefore, I focussed on how trust behaviours are related to
organizational change in a real-life situation.
The concept expressed in Figure 1 was operationalized with the following research
questions, and hypotheses.

Research Questions
•

Which trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, positively?

•

Which trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, negatively?

Hypotheses
•

Positive trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, positively.

•

Negative trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, negatively.

<-----Page 58----->Subhypotheses
These behaviours were operationalized by examining the following 12 subhypotheses:
Hi:

Trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the capacity for change.

H2:

Behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for change, positively.

H3:

Behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for change, negatively.

These hypotheses are subdivided according to three measurable trust behaviours:
Subscales are communication, competence, and contractual trust behaviour. As indicated
earlier, in order to be parsimonious, I correlated these onto one variable, capacity for change.
Communication
HICOMM:

Communication trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the capacity
for change.

HICOMM:

Communication trust behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for
change, positively.

HSCOMM:

Communication trust behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for
change, negatively.

Competence
HICOMP:

Competence trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the capacity for
change.

H2COMP:

Competence trust behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for change,
positively.

H3C0MP: Competence trust behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for change,
negatively.

<-----Page 59----->49
Contractual Behaviour
HICONT:

Contractual trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the capacity for
change.

H2CONT:

Contractual trust behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for change,
positively.

H3C0NT: Contractual trust behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for change,
negatively.
I did a regression of the trust variables onto the capacity for change variable. These
were analysed in a number of ways: I focussed on the first three hypotheses to determine
whether trust behaviours are related, positively or negatively, to the capacity for change. Then,
by further breaking down the variables into their various subscales, I analyzed how trust
behaviours may be further related to the capacity for change, according to the three subscales
of communication, competence, and contractual behaviours. With the small sample size I am
investigating, a significant correlation whose probability is less than .05 is important. I also
explored data results by breaking down the dependent variable, capacity for change, which has
five subscales (discrepancy, appropriateness, efficacy, principal support, valence) as well as
the five moderating, demographic variables (age, gender, education, tenure, location). A
calculation of the mean was used for each variable. Figure 2 outlines how the variables were
explored.
I used SPSS 16.0 for Windows statistical software to analyze the questionnaire data and
determine the regression coefficients in order to predict the relationships among the variables.

Research Field
Bell Canada Inc. is the leading telecommunication service provider in eastern Canada.
Bell Canada is undergoing serious organizational change issues; valued at a little over
$52 billion, it is currently in the process of being purchased by the Ontario Teachers Pension
Plan for an estimated $35 billion. The sale was to conclude in the summer of 2008, and had
been deferred to December 2008. Its executive leadership team has not had a long tenure;
moreover, Bell Canada is challenged by its other major competitors, TELUS and Rogers.

<-----Page 61----->51
Bell Canada is a consortium of companies with its own identity and cultures: different
human resource policies, strengths and weaknesses, personnel policies, and so on. This
situation is further complicated by the fact that Bell Canada has recently acquired a number of
companies with strong entrepreneurial cultures. This merging of different corporate cultures is
having its own challenges. Such an organizational setting is ripe for the study of trust, and how
trust is related to this organization's capacity for change.
The provision of secure telecommunication services is fundamental to the business core of
Bell Canada. The Secure Channel program sector is a unique Bell Canada initiative that
provides authentication, communication, and security services for the Government of Canada.
It is this program sector, Secure Channel Operations and Delivery of Bell Canada Inc. that is
used for my research field. The research participants included 157 employees and managers
from units within Bell Canada's Secure Channel Operations and Delivery program sector, as
indicated in Table 2.

Instrumentation
The literature review identified 13 valid trust measurement tools that have been
recognized in academic journals and books dedicated to research in trust, making it challenging

to adopt one empirical measurement benchmark. The table below, from Dietz and den Hartog,

I chose to use the Organizational Trust Survey (OTS) developed by Reina and Reina
(2006a), because it incorporates the multiple definitions of trust outlined in this study, and
reflects my research approach.

<-----Page 63----->53
Confirming Mendoza (2001), the OTS measures all elements of trust: affective,
cognitive, and behavioural. The subscales on contractual, communication, and competence
trust behaviours report high internal reliability coefficients. The OTS is a 54-question selfreport, 5-point Likert scale designed to measure the level of trust within an organization,
sector, department, or division, from the perspective of employees as well as their managers.
This instrument is based on research from 67 organizations, and content from over 250
interviews and 30 focus groups. Table 4 below provides the internal consistency reliability of
the OTS as assessed during its three most recent administrations. The value used is Cronbach's
alpha, the most widely used measure of internal consistency reliability (Newton & Rudestam,
1999). Appendix D outlines the OTS questions.

A recently published change recipients' belief scale was used, with permission, to
measure the progress of organizational change efforts at any stage of the change process,
according to a 5-point Likert scale identical to the OTS: D = discrepancy; A = appropriateness;
E = efficacy; PS = principal support; V = valence. The validation studies for this instrument
indicate content, convergent and discriminant validity which meet the American Psychological

<-----Page 64----->54
Association psychometric standards (Armenakis et al., 2007). Appendix E outlines the capacity
for change questions.

Survey Process and Security
E-mail invitations were sent to potential study participants at their work e-mail address
by the Senior Director, Secure Channel Sector, with a copy to the organization's Human
Resources Department. Participants agreeing to volunteer for the survey entered the survey
only by clicking on the Informed Consent notice; agreeing to participate, they could then enter
the survey. Participants not wishing to participate simply deleted the invitation e-mail. After
reading the Informed Consent notice, participants navigated to the on-line survey hosted by the
Reina Trust Building Institute (RTBI). Participants completed the on-line survey comprised of
three parts: (a) Demographic Information (age, gender, job title, and tenure); (b) the
Organizational Trust Survey (OTS), and (c) the Capacity for Change Survey (CCS).
Participants were to record their responses manually if they wished to review their individual
results at a later date.
The names of participants who submitted their responses and data were recorded in a
database managed by the RTBI. The survey was open for a period of three calendar weeks to
accommodate summer vacation time. Participants who accepted the invitation but who did not
submit responses within one week were sent a reminder e-mail from the RTBI. Participants
who declined the invitation did not receive a reminder or further e-mails. The average total
time required by participants was estimated at 25 minutes for the three parts of the survey
process.

<-----Page 65----->55
Pilot Process and Results
The pilot was completed the week of June 24,2008. Participants were recruited using
an e-mail invitation sent to their work e-mail address. The e-mail invitation included a
statement that participation is completely voluntary, confidential, and anonymous; it also
included a description of the procedures to ensure confidentiality and anonymity, as well as an
Informed Consent form. The process followed was identical to what is outlined above: The
survey was hosted using an external website (RTBI encrypted site) so that participants could
attain a level of comfort with the functioning and security of the survey website. Participants
were also able to send a personal e-mail to the encrypted Reina survey site through which they
could ask questions or provide comments.
Six members of the Secure Channel Operations and Delivery program of Bell Canada
agreed to participate in the pilot to test survey process and content. Four of the six completed
the survey, and provided debriefing comments that confirmed the process was clear, efficient
and accessible. The content of the survey was not considered an issue, with one exception:
Two pilot participants indicated there was a need to clarify what was meant by "change" and
this was done by providing a definition that was approved by the Senior Director of the Secure
Channel Operations and Delivery program sector. This definition was subsequently clearly
indicated in the invitation, as well as on each page of the survey, and had been incorporated
into the final survey with the following sentence: change is defined as moving to a long-term
contract and operational business model with the Government of Canada for the delivery of
Secure Channel products and services.

RESULTS

Introduction
The purpose of this study was to examine whether a relationship exists between trust
behaviours and an organization's capacity for change. The trust variables comprise three
subscales: communication, competence and contractual behaviours. These subscales include
both positive and negative dimensions. I ran correlations of the six trust variables and the
capacity for change variable in order to find out whether trust variables are related, positively
or negatively, to the capacity for change. I also ran a regression of the six trust variables on the
capacity for change variable to explore the strength of the relationships among the variables.
The regression further explored how well the capacity for change scores could be predicted by
scores of the trust variables.
It must be understood that this study is not looking for a causal relationship among
these variables; rather, this is an exploration of the relationship and significance of this
relationship analysed from data obtained during a survey taken at a given point in time in one
specific organization.
This chapter starts with a demographic overview of the findings, then highlights the
findings of the bivariate correlations, and closes with a regression analysis.

Demographic Information
A total of 157 candidates that work in the Secure Channel Operations and Delivery
program at Bell Canada were invited to participate in this survey. Of these, 85 agreed to

<-----Page 67----->57
participate, therefore providing a robust response rate of 54%, given the sort of web-based
survey approach that was taken (AAPOR, 2000; Kaplowitz, Hadlock, & Levine, 2004).
The survey opened with questions on age, gender, education level, the years worked in
the organization, and job location. Of the total participants, the respondents were mostly men,
at 73%. Women comprised the majority of respondents over the age of 35, at 77%. The
respondents demonstrated a high level of education, with almost half having at least a
bachelor's degree. Of total respondents, 75% worked between one and ten years at their current
place of work. The location of work for 66% of the respondents was internal to Bell Canada,
working in Internal Operations and Delivery. External respondents are those working in
External Business Units, and in a consulting relationship with Bell Canada.

Preliminary Analysis
The survey was comprised of 78 items. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale,
as indicated in Table 5.

The first 54 items focussed on trust; these 54 were further broken into three subscales,
contractual, communication and competence trust behaviours, which each included 18 items.
These 18 comprised 13 items on positive trust behaviours, and 5 on negative trust behaviours.
The capacity for change part of the survey comprised 24 items, which were further broken into
five subscales, these being valence (4 items), principal support (6 items), appropriateness (5

<-----Page 68----->58
items), efficacy (5 items), and discrepancy (4 items). The seven variables were constructed
from the 78 survey items. Table 6 outlines how these variables were coded.

Each of the 78 items was examined to find out if there were anomalies, and to check if
the range of the scores fell within expected parameters. The values of the 78 survey items were
further examined to identify how many participants of the 85 chose not to complete the full
survey, and which values consequently have been omitted. Table 7 outlines the analysis results.

Trust Scales
The six trust variables were computed from the 54 items. The mean and standard
deviation were calculated for each of these trust variables. These six subscales are contractual
building (cbu) and breaking (cbk), communication building (cmbu) and breaking (cbk), and
competence building (cpb) and breaking (cpbk). The scores for positive trust behaviours (cbu,
cmbu, cpb) had a possible range from 13 to 65. The scores for negative trust behaviours (cbk,
cmkb, cpbk) had a possible range from 5 to 25. The mean scores for positive and negative trust
behaviours are displayed in Table 8.
Finally, each of the six variables was examined to confirm there were no computational
anomalies. There were none.

Capacity for Change Scale
The five capacity for change subscales were computed from the 24 items. These 5
subscales (valence, principal support, appropriateness, efficacy, and discrepancy) were added
to form the capacity for change variable. The scores for this variable had a possible range from
24 to 120. There were no computational anomalies in the score results. The mean score is
presented in Table 8.

Correlations

A principal aim of this study was to examine the relationships among the seven
variables. Quantitative data from the survey were gathered and analyzed to determine whether
positive trust relationships are positively related to an organization's capacity for change, and,

<-----Page 71----->61
inversely, whether negative trust relationships were negatively related to an organization's
capacity for change. A second aim of the study was to find out the strength of the relationships
between the six trust predictor variables and the capacity for change response, or outcome,
variable. To achieve the first goal, a bivariate correlation analysis was run to identify the
relationships among these variables. The results of this analysis are indicated in Table 9.

determined at .05 or .01. For this study, the .05 value was selected as it is considered to be
sufficiently robust for this sort of exploratory study (Newton & Rudestam, 1999).

<-----Page 72----->The analyses showed strong relationships among the variables. Understanding that
negative behaviours will register scores that are the inverse of positive behaviours, the results
of the analyses showed the following:
Hi:

Trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the capacity for change.

This hypothesis was demonstrated by the significant correlations between trust-building
behaviours and capacity for change, and the correlations between trust-breaking behaviours
and capacity for change, as indicated in Table 9. These correlations demonstrated there is a
shared variance among these variables.

Regression
I now address the second aim of my study by explaining findings from the two
regression models appropriate for this sort of exploratory analysis. For both models, there was
sufficient data provided by 77 out of 85 respondents. Two approaches were taken for the two
regression models. That is, the first is a theoretical model of the six predictor trust variables on
the outcome or results variable, which was capacity for change. The second approach uses

<-----Page 76----->66
stepwise regression to find the best statistical model that provides the best mathematical
outcome.
The first regression model is represented by this equation:
Y = a + biXi + b2X2 + b3X3 + b4X4 + b5X5 + beXe
It is operationalized by this equation:
cfc = a + bi(cbu) + b2(cbk) + b3(cmbu) + b^cmbk) + bs(cpbu) + b6(cpbk)
The results of this first regression results in a significant model, where p < .05, which is
the significance, accounts for 24% of the variance. This, therefore, is an important finding
especially given the small sample size. However, even if the sample size is small, it is an
entirely appropriate size for my research purposes because I was doing a correlation regression
exploratory study (Donohue, personal communication, 2008).

I now advance to an analysis of the second model. The results show significant
outcomes, where p < .05, accounts for 22% of the variance. These findings are also important
given the small sample size. Because this is a stepwise regression, the computations resulted in
the best mathematical model using the competence trust-building predictor variable. The
computation concluded that none of the other predictor variables contributed significantly to
this model.

Conclusion
In this chapter I examined the relationship between trust behaviours and the capacity
for change. Correlations were run of the six trust variables and the capacity for change variable
to find out whether trust variables are related, positively or negatively, to the capacity for
change. As expected and predicted by the extensive literature on trust, the analysis showed that
there was a strong association between positive trust behaviours and an organization's capacity
for change. Negative trust behaviours were strongly, and negatively, associated with an
organization's capacity for change.
I also wanted to explore the strength of the relationships among the variables and how
well the capacity for change scores could be predicted by scores of the trust variables. Two
regression models were run; the first, a theoretical regression model, showed a significant
linear relationship between the six trust predictor variables and the one capacity for change
outcome variable. The second model looked at a number of computations to find out the best
mathematical model; the results pointed to the competence trust-building predictor variable as
contributing the most significantly to this model, and therefore, to an organization's capacity
for change.
The significance of these findings and their relationship to the literature review is
discussed more fully in the next chapter.

<-----Page 80----->70

CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSION

Introduction
The literature review highlighted the complexity of the concept of trust, as well as
distrust. This review suggested there was no agreed definition and understanding of these
concepts. In order to relate the results of my research with the literature review, I confine my
discussion to the organizational context within which trust is experienced, and, where possible,
identify those behavioural characteristics which most closely reflect the transactional definition
of trust adopted by the trust survey instrument I used. That is, transactional trust is lived in
relationship, and is experienced through three sets of behaviours. Contractual trust comprises
the management of expectations, establishing boundaries, delegating, encouraging mutual
intentionality, respecting agreements, and consistency of behaviour. Communication trust
includes sharing information, truthfulness, admitting mistakes, giving and taking constructive
feedback, confidentiality, and speaking with good purpose. Lastly, competence trust
behaviours include acknowledging skills and abilities, letting people make decisions, seeking
input, and helping people learn. These sets of behaviours can build trust, or break it (Reina &
Reina, 2006b). The literature review suggests that trust is a key enabler of change. In an
unstable environment where an organization moves from one state to another, trust between
managers and employees helps mitigate concern of the uncertainty surrounding the change
(Armenakis et al, 1999; Lines et ah, 2005; Saunders & Thornhill, 2004), and therefore adds to
the capacity for change in an organizational context.

<-----Page 81----->71
This chapter outlines how the state of trust within an organization is related to its
capacity for change, understanding that what follows is not a suggestion there are causal
relationships between findings and hypotheses. I now refer systematically to the two main
hypotheses, and their subhypotheses as outlined in the previous chapter:

Hypotheses
1.

Positive trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, positively.

2.

Negative trust behaviours affect an organization's capacity for change, negatively.
Of the many elements that were identified to characterize trust, the literature

emphasizes ability, benevolence, integrity, expectations, and propensity to trust the other.
Evidence of these behavioural characteristics, if performed well, reinforce the trustor's positive
expectations that the risk to trust was well intentioned (Mayer et al, 1995; Rousseau et al,
1998; Schoorman et al, 2007). This, in turn, leads to trustworthiness and an increase in mutual
cooperation and sociability within an organizational context. Trust and its mirror,
trustworthiness, provide employees with the confidence of positive expectations they may have
of their employer (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). With trust and confidence in management's
integrity and reliability, resistance to change is mediated, and the acceptance of change is more
probable because the communication, coming from trusted management, makes the need for
change believable (Kotter, 1995; Meyer & Stensaker, 2006; Smollan, 2006).
As a converse to positive trust behaviours, the breach of trust is understood as a rupture
in relationship, and a broken promise to employee commitments in the context of an
organization. The breach could be calculative, and could be rooted in cognition, where the
actor is fully aware of what is being done, as well as rooted in the affect, where feelings are
hurt and the ensuing negative emotions could compromise the sense of psychological safety in

<-----Page 82----->72
a workplace environment (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995, 1996; Lewicki et ah, 1998; Reina &
Reina, 2006b). During a time of organizational change, trust in management's integrity and its
reliability have been highlighted as an absolute requirement to gain employee cooperation
during the change process (Cunningham et al, 2002; Kotter & Schlesinger, 1979).
Numerical results from the correlation analysis demonstrate that empirically, there are
significant correlations between trust-building behaviours and capacity for change, and there
are significant correlations between trust-breaking behaviours and capacity for change.
Furthermore, as trust-building behaviours increase, the capacity for change increases. As trustbreaking behaviours increase, there is a decrease in the capacity for change.

Subhypotheses

Hi: Trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the capacity for change.
A number of behaviours have been identified which can build trust, or break it. In
addition to those behaviours cited in hypothesis 1 and 2, a stream of literature outlines how
these behaviours, if lived in practice, provide evidence to employees of whether these
behaviours have consequences on trust-building, or trust-breaking. In an organization,
behaviours are observed to support whether positive expectations can be fulfilled, and whether
the placement of trust was not futile. In particular, people who occupy roles in fiduciary
positions, such as management, are closely observed for their functional and interpersonal
competence, openness, directness, consistency, judgment, and integrity (Barber, 1983; Butler,
1991; McCauley & Kuhnert, 1992). In a time of change, trust in management, as exemplified
by managerial behaviour, has been identified as an important change process characteristic

<-----Page 83----->73

(Cunningham et al, 2002; van Dam et ah, 2008). Logically, then, behaviours contrary to these
would impede the organizational change process.
Numerical results from the correlation analysis demonstrate that empirically, there are
significant correlations between trust-building behaviours and capacity for change, and trustbreaking behaviours and capacity for change.

flb: Behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for change, positively.
The literature review suggests that trust is influenced by a psychological state of being,
and is achieved through a number of psychological processes that are the result of personal
attributes as well as experiences in organizations and institutions (Kramer, Brewer, & Hanna,
1996; Rousseau et ah, 1998). As organizations engage in the process of change, the state of
uncertainty surrounding the change suggests this is a risky situation (Deutsch, 1958). The
literature says that in order to trust, and to perceive that the act of trusting was worth the risk,
there has to be a belief that another's future actions will be beneficial (Robinson, 1996). If
trusting behaviour, then, is historically situated and a learned experience, then qualitative
interactions in the workplace can increase the feeling of psychological safety (Edmondson,
2004). In such an environment, possible outcomes could lead to greater innovation and
working beyond the limitation of job descriptions, all essential attributes in times of
organizational flux. In such circumstances, if trust is high, then difficult organizational
decisions such as those taken in a time of change could be received more receptively (Dirks &
Ferrin, 2001), thus facilitating the change process.
The empirical findings demonstrate there are positive correlations between trustbuilding behaviours and capacity for change. Moreover, an increase in trust-building
behaviours is associated with an increase in capacity for change.

<-----Page 84----->74

H3: Behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for change, negatively.
The stream of literature which addresses the darker side of trust says that a breach of
trust creates a state of instability; depending on the depth of the breach, the effect could range
from being a minor nuisance, to becoming the cause of a life-altering experience. The literature
concurs that regardless of the type of breach that is incurred, there will be a cost to an
organization. This cost, in a time of change, could be measured by damaged human relations
and lost corporate productivity (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995, 1996; Lewicki et al, 1998), factors
suggesting it would be harder to carry out change. The correlations between trust-breaking
behaviours and capacity for change show that an increase in trust-breaking behaviours is
associated with a decrease in capacity for change.

Contractual Behaviour
HICONT:

Contractual trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the
capacity for change.

When trust is positioned as leading to a generalized expectation of the trustworthiness
of others, implicit in this understanding is a contractual relationship between the trustor and
trustee. If the risk taken to trust has been rewarded with a fulfillment of this expectation, then
there is incentive to continue trusting. This, in turn, enables cooperation within an
organizational context (Barber, 1983; Das & Teng, 1998, 2001; Mayer et al, 1995; Schoorman
et al., 2007). In contrary fashion, if the expectation is not fulfilled, then this implies that the
contractual relationship between trustor and trustee, to some extent, has been breached, and
this breach could result in distrust. The effects could be diminished corporate productivity, and
higher organizational costs in terms of damaged human relations (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995,

<-----Page 85----->75
1996; Lewicki et al.,1998; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Robinson, 1996). Such a toxic
organizational situation is not conducive to the adaptability required for change (Lines et al.,
2005; Saunders & Thornhill, 2004). The empirical analysis reinforces this notional relationship
by showing there are significant correlations between contractual trust behaviours and capacity
for change.
BbcoNT:

Contractual trust behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for
change, positively.

In addition to meeting positive expectations of the other, a contractual relationship
between trustor and trustee could enhance behavioural coordination and be a visible sign of
mutual commitment; it could also be used to deter unwanted risk within an organizational
context (Costa & Bijlsma-Frankema, 2007; Lane, 1998; Lane & Bachmann, 2002). There are
many ways of implementing contractual arrangements; what is important is the degree of
control that a manager wants to carry out, and the extent to which this may impact on trust
between employee and manager in an organization. Trustworthy behaviour is enabled when a
manager loosens formal, authoritative control and encourages employee participation (Weibel,
2007). Consistent behaviour, respected agreements, and delegation improve the quality of
exchanges within an organization (Douglas & Zivnuska, 2008); employees who are trusted and
empowered can focus their attention on organizational requirements (Mayer & Gavin, 2005)
such as refocused priorities during a time of organizational transition (Kotter & Schlesinger,
1979). The empirical findings point to significant correlations between contractual trustbuilding behaviours and capacity for change. The relationship is positive since the correlation
is positive; therefore, an increase in contractual trust-building behaviours is associated with an
increase in capacity for change.

<-----Page 86----->H3CONT" Contractual trust behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for
change, negatively.
The literature clearly identifies which contractual trust behaviours break trust. That is, a
rupture in relationship with the other signifies a breached contractual arrangement, since
positive expectations of benevolence, integrity, and agreements will not have been met. The
lack of congruency in contractual trust behaviour can even become a source of challenge to
managerial authority and effectiveness (Atkinson, 2004; Atkinson & Butcher, 2003; Caldwell
& Hayes, 2006), characteristics which are not helpful to an organization in a time of change
(Dirks & Ferrin, 2001). The validity of this concept was demonstrated by the significant
correlations between the contractual trust-breaking behaviours, and capacity for change. The
relationship is negative because the correlation is negative; therefore, findings show that an
increase in contractual trust-breaking behaviours is associated with a decrease in capacity for
change.

Communication
HICOMM*.

Communication trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the
capacity for change.

Trust, as a relational concept in an organizational context, requires social interaction
between employees, and employees and managers. The clarity of messages enhances
credibility of the delivery, therefore enabling the building of trust between receptor and
deliverer of the communication. Trust is recognized as the outcome of good organizational
communication; as decisions are explained and made believable, openness demonstrates
sincerity and accessibility (Bambacas & Patrickson, 2008; Elsbach & Elofson, 2000; Reina &
Reina, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b). Open and sincere communication is an indication of

<-----Page 87----->genuine concern for employees; for this reason, such acts of perceived benevolence help to
make organizational change more acceptable (Korsgaard et al, 2002; C. C. Williams, 2005). If
good communication increases organizational congruence, then inauthentic, poor
communication adds to the state of uncertainty surrounding the change process. Poor
communication adds to misunderstanding, and even fear during this unstable time (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996; Morrison & Robinson, 1997). The state of perceived organizational
trustworthiness influences how employees respond to change (Meyer & Stensaker, 2006;
Smollan, 2006). The empirical findings demonstrate there are significant correlations between
communication trust behaviours, and capacity for change
H2COMM:

Communication trust behaviours which build trust affect the capacity
for change, positively.

In addition to the effects of communication trust-building behaviours highlighted
above, good organizational communication practices enable competence, openness, concern,
reliability and identification with others (Shockley-Zalabak, 2000; Shockley-Zalabak et al.,
2000a; Shockley-Zalabak et al., 2000b). Such a process of identification goes a long way to
encourage two-way communication between employees and managers. Despite the position of
authority occupied by managers, trust can be socially constructed as a duality, where,
interestingly, control and trust become inseparable (Mollering, 2005; Reed, 2001) and one is
not detrimental to the other. In an organizational context, where trust and control are one, open
exchanges between managers and employees are enhanced as psychological safety is enabled;
such organizational openness is recognized as improving problem-solving capabilities and
openness to new learning, all essential attributes in a time of organizational transition
(Deutsch, 1958; Edmondson, 2004; Fisher, 1997; Gillespie, 2003; Lewicki & Bunker, 1995;

<-----Page 88----->78

Senge et ah, 1994). As has been already stated, understanding the reason for a change helps
make the change process easier to implement. In addition, being open about the change and
being accessible for more information maintains trust in management; such acts of leadership
which help develop trusting followers are recognized as important capacity for change enablers
(Dervitsiotis, 2006; Judge etal, 2006; Meyer & Stensaker, 2006; Smollan, 2006). The
empirical analysis shows there are significant correlations between communication trustbuilding behaviours and capacity for change. The relationship between the variables is positive
because the correlations are positive; therefore, an increase in communication trust-building
behaviours is associated with an increase in capacity for change.
H3COMM:

Communication trust behaviours which break trust affect the capacity
for change, negatively.

It has been shown in the above hypotheses how important good organizational
communication is to an organization's capacity for change. Taking a converse perspective,
inauthentic and bad organizational communication leads to misunderstanding and uncertainty
around a change process; at worst, bad communication leads to corporate distrust (Saunders &
Thornhill, 2004). An atmosphere of distrust during a change, such as a merger, is a serious
vulnerability which can lead to acts of destruction or even sabotage by those affected by the
change (Ozag, 2006; Searle & Ball, 2004; Thau et al, 2007). The empirical analysis
demonstrates significant correlations between communication trust-breaking behaviours and
capacity for change. The relationship is negative because the correlation is negative, and so, an
increase in communication trust-breaking behaviours is associated with a decrease in capacity
for change.

Competence
HICOMP:

Competence trust behaviours affect, positively or negatively, the
capacity for change.

The importance of recognizing employee contributions to the health of an organization,
by acknowledging their abilities, seeking input, and supporting continuous learning are traits
acknowledged in well-known, popular literature on organizations (Kotter, 1995; Kotter &
Schlesinger, 1979; Senge et al, 1994). It has been stated that supporting these traits enables an
organization to deal with the pressure of change, since employees will feel empowered through
these contractual trust behaviours and will feel more inclined to support the organization
through the transition process (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001). It has also been stated that when
promises to employees are broken, there is an unquestionable, negative consequence on an
organization. This consequence can be measured in terms of lost creativity and productivity;
when positive, traits both essential to help an organization through the change process
(Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Robinson, 1996). The empirical findings from my analysis show
there are significant correlations between competence trust behaviours, and capacity for
change.
H2COMPJ

Competence trust behaviours which build trust affect the capacity for
change, positively.

Early trust literatures, including classics on organizational theory, stress the importance
of competence and integrity in organizations. The expectation that a promise can be "relied
upon" provides the conceptual foundation for trust (Rotter, 1970). Competence, integrity, and
realized promises are traits recognized as being so vital they are said to affect the very survival
of an organizational system (Barber, 1983; Barnard, 1968; Coleman, 1990; Gabarro, 1978;

<-----Page 90----->Luhmann, 1979), not to say of society as a whole. The generalized expectation of trust, and of
trustworthiness, are behavioural characteristics that enable open exchanges between employees
and managers in an organizational context, and enable participatory, democratic styles of
management that engender qualitative workplaces (Douglas & Zivnuska, 2008; Mayer &
Gavin, 2005; Rousseau et al, 1998; Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis, 1996; Six, 2005). A stream
of literature suggests that trust can be reinforced through historical experiences; viewed
through this lens, then, repeated acts of trust result in a spiral of repeated trust (Zand, 1972)
that helps to ensure the trustee that the trustor will behave in an expected way (Behnia, 2004).
Such leadership behaviours, then, when linked to accountability standards in an organization,
contribute strongly to a sense of psychological safety at the workplace, and enable the
characteristics needed to develop a capacity for change during times of transition. Such
characteristics include the ability to innovate, deal with organizational problems, and be
flexible enough to work beyond the confines of job descriptions (Ammeter et al, 2004;
Armenakis et al, 1999; Armenakis & Mossholder, 1993; Edmondson, 2004; Gibb, 1978).
The empirical analysis resulted in demonstrating significant correlations between competence
trust-building behaviours, and capacity for change. The relationship is positive because the
correlation is positive; therefore, an increase in competence trust-building behaviours is
associated with an increase in capacity for change. In addition, it is important to note that in
my stepwise regression to find the best statistical model, I discovered that competence is the
mediator variable that contributed the most significantly to my computations.
H3COMP:

Competence trust behaviours which break trust affect the capacity for
change, negatively.

<-----Page 91----->81
If competence trust behaviours are based on ability, benevolence, integrity, a generalized
expectation of the trustworthiness of others, acknowledging the skills and abilities of others,
seeking input, and enabling a learning environment (Mayer et al, 1995; Reina & Reina, 2007a,
2007b; Rousseau et al, 1998; Schoorman et al, 2007), then evidence contrary to these
characteristics could be indicative of a breach in competence trust behaviours. Literature
focussed on organizational leadership highlights the consequences of a workplace environment
rife with distrust. Particularly in a time of change, it is unlikely that disgruntled and angry
employees will be supportive of an organization in transition. Some literature even suggests
that employees may engage in destructive activities to damage the organization (Bunker &
Rubin, 1995; Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Ozag, 2006; Robinson, 1996; Searle & Ball, 2004;
Thau et al, 2007). This notion was demonstrated by the significant correlations between the
competence trust-breaking behaviours, and capacity for change. The relationship is negative
because the correlation is negative; therefore, an increase in competence trust-breaking
behaviours is associated with a decrease in capacity for change.

Limitations of this Study

Research Field
The research was based on a survey which was carried out during a specific point in
time, in one organizational program sector. The sample size was limited to people working in
that program sector; while the participation rate was very good, it could have been interesting
to have more people take part in the survey, and to include other program sectors within Bell
Canada.

<-----Page 92----->82

A big complication arose during the early stages of my research invitation for Bell
Canada's participation. Just as the survey was about to be launched, a major staff change
stalled the survey process. The resultant survey process delays could have affected survey
participation, and the quality of survey responses.

Definitions
I used a definition of trust developed by the Reina Trust Building Institute; other
variants could have been considered. The capacity for change definition was limited to the one
defined by Armenakis et al. (2007).

Survey Instrumentation
The survey which I used to quantify trust behaviours was developed according to one
specific set of definitions related to trust; while I found these definitions to be comprehensive,
it could have been interesting to consider other trust survey instruments which follow other
variations on trust to gauge the level of trust within an organization. The same is true for the
capacity for change portion of the survey. Other interpretations of capacity for change could
have added more dimension to my understanding of the capacity for change, and could have
been reflected in a different survey approach.

Research Methodology
I did a correlation of trust variables onto capacity for change to find out if these were
related; a regression analysis addressed the strength of this relationship, and explored the
possibility of predictor variables. This exploratory approach did not investigate if there was a
causal relationship among the variables.

<-----Page 93----->83
Capacity for change was studied by taking a parsimonious approach: that is, I collapsed
five subscales of capacity for change, into one variable. For a more accurate understanding of
elements conducive to an organization's capacity for change, it could be interesting to take a
more detailed approach and examine correlations among all five capacity for change subscales,
and trust variables.

Qualitative Data
I did not incorporate the gathering of qualitative information into my final analysis. The
addition of a qualitative perspective on trust and capacity for change would have added a
different contextual flavour to the findings, and greater richness to this study.

Executive Sponsorship
Executive sponsorship of my research allowed me to enter and work with Bell Canada
employees in order to carry out my doctoral research. However, in having executives sponsor
my research and sign off e-mails to employees inviting them to participate in my research,
executive involvement may have affected the response rate as well as the quality of the
responses.

CHAPTER SIX
CONCLUSION

Introduction
In this final chapter I share my observations and significant findings, suggest some
implications for research and practice, and end with suggestions for future research.

Observations
I found it important to note that trust gained such prominence in academic circles, as
well as organizational practice, over the last two decades. It took, however, a number of
organizational business disasters to realize that treating people like material assets has
consequences, one of these being the lack of trust resulting in the erosion of loyalty and
corporate allegiance. With globalization and the economic interconnectivity of countries, it is
indisputable that organizations and the people working in them need to be flexible and
adaptable to the pressures of change, in order to survive and even flourish. However,
organizations also need to consider the human toll of not carrying out corporate transitions
with sensitivity and care.
This study showed that trust behaviours are clearly associated with an organization's
capacity for change. Interestingly, computations showed that the competence trust-building
predictor variable contributed the most significantly to the capacity for change. In my mind,
this means that people in organizations have to live up to their commitments and the

<-----Page 95----->85
expectations made of them, or there may be consequences on capacity for change, and the
effectiveness of organizational change processes.

Implications for Research and Practice
There are a number of ways that understanding the relationship between trust and the
capacity for change could benefit research, as well as organizations. On a conceptual level,
while there are many interpretations of trust, perhaps a closer examination of what behaviours
enable trust, and which ones break trust, could lead to a more reflexive awareness of individual
responsibility in making trust "happen" (Mollering, 2006a, 2006b; Six, 2005; Vlaar et al,
2007). Based on this greater awareness of self, perhaps the work that Gibb (1978) initiated
could be retrieved, refreshed, and updated to include current academic thinking in social
constructionism.
With regard to research methodology, the use of surveys is helpful in providing a
snapshot of the current state of an organization at one point in time. However, it would be
interesting and useful if trust behaviours and capacity for change indicators could be updated to
deal with globalization challenges such as multiculruralism, religious and ethnic diversity, and
gender (Arnott, 2007a, 2007b; Bachmann & Zaheer, 2006a; Doney et al, 2007; Mizrachi et
al, 2007; Poppo et al, 2008; Schoorman et al, 2007; Tsui-Auch & Mollering, 2007;
Waldman, de Luque, Washburn, & House, 2006; Wasti, Tan, Brower, & Onder, 2007).
On the practical side, having a greater awareness of the importance of trust can mitigate
the effects of downsizing before and after it happens. Greater involvement of senior managers
with employees in a time of change is likely to increase trust. For management practice,
enacting trust could encourage more constructive responses of survivors in downsized
organizations when a more humane approach to organizational change is taken (Clark &

<-----Page 96----->86
Payne, 1997; Lines etal, 2005; Meyer & Stensaker, 2006; Mishra, 1996; Smollan, 2006). To
implement better trust-based management practices, performance appraisals and reward
policies might consider the role of trust and its impact on organizational performance (Mayer
& Davis, 1999; Mayer & Gavin, 2005; Spreitzer & Mishra, 1999). If trust in management is
low, this could become an opportunity to build trust. In this context, organizational change
could be designed to build trust as a core objective, with the benefits of positive change
becoming secondary objectives. Careful design as the change is carried out could positively
affect employees' trust in management; such a consideration could be especially attractive for
those managers with a proclivity toward democratic work processes (Lines et al, 2005; Reina
& Reina, 2006a, 2006b, 2007b; Tomlinson & Mayer, In press). Understanding how to repair
broken trust could regenerate the workplace by renewing corporate commitment, loyalty, and
maybe even support for change (Gillespie & Dietz, 2008; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Morrison
& Robinson, 1997; Reina & Reina, 2006b; C. C. Williams, 2005).

Future Research
With reference to research methodology, future researchers may be interested in
establishing causal relationships between trust and the capacity for change variables in order to
increase the internal validity of the findings in relation to the statistical analysis. Longitudinal
research could also be an interesting approach in settings where change is initiated, and after it
had been implemented, to find out how trust affected the change process, and whether the
organization integrated trust behavioural competencies into performance measures or other
means of measuring results. A new survey instrument could be considered, with factor analysis
to figure out if the survey is viable. While there is considerable literature on organizational
change, there is not much research on the link between organizational change and trust. In light

<-----Page 97----->87
of the great resurgence of interest in trust, and considering the state of global uncertainty, this
could be an important area for future research. In addition, the darker side of trust merits
research attention in order to understand better the relational as well as the organizational costs
of broken trust, and the benefits of trust repair in regenerating workplace hope, with a renewed
belief in corporate values.

I have an important question to ask around confidentiality. Are you the right person to ask
regarding the degree to which I may identify Bell as my research field, once I start drafting the
dissertation, or should I ask Don? (That is, identify the company, but not the sector and
certainly not the survey participants).
Thank you.

Appendix B: Informed Consent
You have been invited to participate in a research study, entitled The Relationship between
Trust and Capacity for Change, conducted by Margaret Rudolf, a doctoral student in the
School of Human and Organizational Systems at Fielding Graduate University, Santa Barbara,
CA. This study is supervised by Thierry Pauchant, Ph.D. This research involves the study of
trust in organizations and is part of Margaret's Fielding course work in preparation for her
dissertation research. You are being asked to participate in this study because you were
referred by Mr. Kenneth Smith. Your participation is entirely voluntary; should you choose not
to participate, please know that Mr. Smith will not be advised as to your choice.
The study involves the completion of a two-part survey, which includes The Reina
Organizational Trust Scale and Capacity for Change survey to be arranged at your
convenience. The two parts will come together as one seamless survey for your feedback entry.
Answering the survey should not take more than 30 minutes. The researcher may ask you to
provide feedback on the survey process to make sure that the process is clear, and does not
pose an excessive burden on the respondent's time.
The information you provide will be kept strictly confidential. The informed consent forms and
other identifying information will be kept separate from the data. All study records will be kept
on a server which is accessible only to the researcher at her secure site, and the confidential
Research Assistant, who has signed the attached Professional Assistance Confidentiality
Agreement. All study records will be destroyed by the researcher 3 years after the study is
complete.
The results of this research will be used as a pilot and will be included in a Knowledge
Assessment paper.
You may develop greater personal awareness of your behaviour in a trust relationship, at a time
when your organization is undergoing change as a result of your participation in this research.
The risks to you are considered minimal; should you experience emotional discomfort during
or after the survey, please contact the regional Bell Canada Employee Assistance Office.
You may withdraw from this study at any time, either during or after your participation,
without negative consequences. Should you withdraw, your data will be eliminated from the
study and will be destroyed. No compensation will be provided for participation.
You will be provided a summary of the final results. If you have any questions about any
aspect of this study or your involvement, please tell the Researcher before proceeding with the
survey. Margaret Rudolf can be reached at 613-295—4700.
You may also contact the supervising faculty if you have questions or concerns your
participation in this study by contacting Fielding Graduate University IRB by email at
irb@fielding.edu or by telephone at 805-898-4033. Please save a copy of this consent notice

Our project, Secure Channel, and our people are currently experiencing an exceptionally high
period of change through the evolving requirements of our customers as well as changes within
our companies.
I believe we hold a mutual desire to have a workplace where we are respected, where coming
to work will bring challenge and enjoyment, and where we are proud to work in a time of
change. I am inviting you to participate in a learning process about building trust and
navigating change by completing a two-part survey.
The first part is the Reina Organizational Trust Scale® which measures the level of trust in the
behaviors that we practice in our organization. The second part is the Capacity for Change
survey which will help us find out how we're navigating with the current pace of change in our
organization. The two parts will come together as one seamless survey for your feedback entry.
This survey will help further our understanding of where we may focus our attention in the
trust-building and change processes. As mentioned at our last Secure Channel town hall, I have
been working with Margaret Rudolf and this input will form the basis of her Ph.D. dissertation.
Although not directly involved, the Bell executive team (Vanda, Jean & Gary) fully endorse
the value of this groundbreaking study - to the best of our knowledge, this is the first Ph.D.
dissertation that focuses on the relationship of how trust impacts the ability for effective
change in a major Canadian organization.
Margaret's study has been reviewed and approved by the Fielding Graduate University
Institutional Review Board.
It is important for you to know that you will be provided with the results of this survey. As
with any survey, the greater the participation the more effective the results so our goal is 100%
completion. Participation is completely optional but your participation is important! The
survey will be open beginning June 15 with a planned completion date of June 18.1 want to
assure you that your responses are anonymous, as no one's identity will be revealed. The
aggregate data will be shared as a synthesized feedback report. The survey has been approved
by Bell Canada and Fielding Graduate University's Institutional Review Board and the results
will be reported in a Ph.D. dissertation for this University.
You will be asked a series of demographic questions on the instrument. These are both for
research purposes and for feedback purposes. The data will be broken down into categories of
information to enhance our understanding of your input and to support use of the information
in a meaningful way. You will also be asked questions regarding your view of the
organization, management, and employees' behaviors.

<-----Page 117----->107
Step-by-step instructions for completing the survey are attached to this email and you will need
our Survey Instrument Code which is [INSTRUMENT CODE] in order to log in to the survey.
It will take you approximately 30 minutes to complete the survey. Please take the time to get
involved through completion by [CLOSE DATE]! Together we can make a difference for
ourselves and for those we encounter every day!
