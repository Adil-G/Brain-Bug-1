Three experiments tested a motivated information processing account of the interpersonal effects of anger
and happiness in negotiations. In Experiment 1, participants received information about the opponent’s
emotion (anger, happiness, or none) in a computer-mediated negotiation. As predicted, they conceded
more to an angry opponent than to a happy one (controls falling in between), but only when they had a
low (rather than a high) need for cognitive closure. Experiment 2 similarly showed that participants were
only affected by the other’s emotion under low rather than high time pressure, because time pressure
reduced their degree of information processing. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that negotiators were only
influenced by their opponent’s emotion if they had low (rather than high) power. These results support
the motivated information processing model by showing that negotiators are only affected by their
opponent’s emotions if they are motivated to consider them.

short duration (Barry, 1999; Forgas, 1992; Oatley & Jenkins,
1996), and intentional, that is, directed at an object, person, or
event (Frijda, 1993; Russell & Feldman Barrett, 1999). In this
article we use the term emotion in the sense intended above,
whereas affect is used as a superordinate construct that encompasses both moods and emotions (cf. Barry & Oliver, 1996).
Prior research has mostly focused on the intrapersonal effects of
affect (moods and emotions) in negotiation, that is, the influence of
a negotiator’s emotional state on his or her own behavior. For
example, positive affect has been shown to increase concession
making (R. A. Baron, 1990), stimulate creative problem solving
(Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987), increase joint gains (Allred,
Mallozzi, Matsui, & Raia, 1997; Carnevale & Isen, 1986), increase
preferences for cooperation (R. A. Baron, Fortin, Frei, Hauver, &
Shack, 1990), reduce the use of contentious tactics (Carnevale &
Isen, 1986), and increase the use of cooperative negotiation strategies (Forgas, 1998). Conversely, negative affect has been shown
to decrease initial offers (R. A. Baron et al., 1990), decrease joint
gains (Allred et al., 1997), promote the rejection of ultimatum
offers (Pillutla & Murnighan, 1996), increase the use of competitive strategies (Forgas, 1998), and decrease the desire to work
together in the future (Allred et al., 1997).
These studies show quite consistently that negotiators experiencing positive affect tend to be more cooperative and conciliatory, whereas negotiators in a negative affective state tend to be
more competitive and reluctant to make concessions. Although this
research has greatly improved our understanding of the interplay
between a negotiator’s affective state and his or her cognitions and
behavior, it has ignored the fact that negotiation is a social phenomenon—negotiators’ emotions influence not only themselves,
but also their counterparts. Recently, several scholars have emphasized the importance of the interpersonal effects of emotions in
negotiations (e.g., Adler, Rosen, & Silverstein, 1998; Barry, 1999;
Barry, Fulmer, & Van Kleef, in press; Barry & Oliver, 1996;
Davidson & Greenhalgh, 1999; Morris & Keltner, 2000; Thomp-

Negotiation is one of the most common and constructive ways
of dealing with social conflict. It may be defined as the joint
decision making between interdependent individuals with divergent interests (Pruitt, 1998). Most of us negotiate on a regular
basis, for instance with our spouses about the division of household chores, with our children about how to spend the holidays,
and with our students about task assignments in a research project.
Although emotions are inherent to negotiation and social conflict
(Davidson & Greenhalgh, 1999), and are crucial to understanding
how individuals behave within bargaining situations (Barry, 1999),
surprisingly little attention has been given to the role of emotions
in negotiations. In this article we focus on the social effects of
emotions in negotiation (i.e., the way negotiators respond to their
opponent’s emotions) and develop a motivated information processing model that accounts for these effects.

Emotions in Negotiation
There are myriad definitions of emotion. However, most definitions point to three distinct features of emotion: physiological
reactions, action tendencies, and subjective experience (Lazarus,
1991). Emotions differ from moods in that they are discrete (Russell & Feldman Barrett, 1999), of relatively high intensity and

son, Medvec, Seiden, & Kopelman, 2001; Thompson, Nadler, &
Kim, 1999; Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004), arguing that
emotions have important social functions and consequences. Most
notably, emotions convey information about how one feels about
things (Ekman, 1993; Scherer, 1986), about one’s social intentions
(Ekman, Friesen, & Ellsworth, 1972; Fridlund, 1994), and about
one’s orientation toward other people (Knutson, 1996). In this
way, emotions can serve as incentives or deterrents for other
people’s behavior (Klinnert, Campos, Sorce, Emde, & Svejda,
1983): Negative emotions serve as a call for mental or behavioral
adjustment, whereas positive emotions serve as a cue to stay the
course (Cacioppo & Gardner, 1999).
This shift in focus from the intrapersonal effects to the interpersonal effects of emotions has resulted in a number of articles on
different aspects of the interpersonal effects of emotions in negotiation (see, e.g., Barry, 1999; Barry & Oliver, 1996; Kopelman,
Rosette, & Thompson, 2001; Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2004; Thompson et al., 2001; Van Kleef et al., 2004). Most relevant for our
present purposes are the studies by Van Kleef et al. (2004) and
Sinaceur and Tiedens (2004). In a computer-mediated negotiation
task with a simulated opponent, Van Kleef et al. (2004, Experiment 1) provided participants with information about the opponent’s emotional state (angry, happy, or no emotion) at three time
points during the negotiation. Consistent with the social functions
perspective outlined above, participants with an angry opponent
placed lower demands and made larger concessions than did
participants with a nonemotional opponent, whereas participants
with a happy opponent placed higher demands and made smaller
concessions. Sinaceur and Tiedens (2004) examined the effects of
anger using a different paradigm and obtained similar results. In
face-to-face negotiations, they instructed one negotiator in each
dyad to show either anger or no emotion. In line with the results
obtained by Van Kleef et al. (2004), Sinaceur and Tiedens found
that participants conceded more to an angry as opposed to a
nonemotional counterpart. Thus, results from research in different
experimental settings (i.e., computer-mediated and face-to-face)
point to the powerful social impact of anger and happiness on
negotiation behavior. These findings are strongly compatible with
the social functions perspective, because they show that anger
triggers behavioral adjustment (i.e., larger concessions) by serving
as a negative reinforcer of other people’s behavior, whereas happiness triggers smaller concessions by serving as a positive
reinforcer.
Furthering the understanding of the processes underlying the
effects of anger and happiness, Van Kleef et al. (2004, Experiment
2) showed that these effects result from tracking (see Pruitt, 1981).
Negotiators used their opponent’s emotions to infer the location of
his or her limits and subsequently used this information to make a
counteroffer. In other words, negotiators who were confronted
with an angry opponent estimated the opponent’s limit to be high,
and to avoid costly impasse, they placed low demands and made
large concessions. Conversely, negotiators with a happy opponent
judged the opponent’s limit to be low, felt no need to concede to
avoid impasse, and accordingly placed high demands and made
small concessions. In conjunction with the previously described
research on the social functions of emotions, these findings suggest
that the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness are the result
of a process of strategic decision making on the part of the
emotion-perceiving negotiator. In other words, negotiators use the

511

information about the other’s emotion to design their own negotiation strategy.
Negotiating is a complex and cognitively taxing venture. Negotiators need to keep in mind their own preferences and limits and,
at the same time, monitor the opponent’s behavior, try to locate his
or her limits, and combine all this information to design an optimal
strategy. The question that arises is whether negotiators are motivated to mobilize their scarce cognitive resources to pay attention
to, scrutinize, and process the strategic information that is provided
by the opponent’s emotions. In the following section, we provide
an overview of the literature pertaining to motivation and information processing in negotiations and propose that the degree to
which negotiators will be influenced by their opponent’s emotions
will depend on their motivation to process the strategic information implicit in those emotions.

Motivated Information Processing
According to so-called dual-process models, individuals can
process information in either a quick, effortless, and heuristic way
or in a more effortful, deliberate, and systematic manner (for
overviews, see Chaiken & Trope, 1999; Kruglanski & Thompson,
1999; Smith & DeCoster, 2000). Whether individuals will engage
in such systematic and thorough information processing depends
on their epistemic motivation—the desire to develop and maintain
a rich and accurate understanding of the world, including the
negotiation task (De Dreu & Carnevale, 2003; Kruglanski, 1989;
Kruglanski & Ajzen, 1983).
Epistemic motivation can be rooted in individual differences.
For instance, individuals differ in their chronic need for cognitive
closure (Kruglanski & Webster, 1996; Webster & Kruglanski,
1994). Individuals at the high need for closure end of the continuum are characterized by considerable cognitive impatience. They
tend to process less information before committing to a position or
a course of action, and they are likely to leap to judgment on the
basis of incomplete information. Individuals low in need for closure, on the other hand, prefer to suspend judgment until they have
processed all the available information or until time and energy are
depleted (Kruglanski & Ajzen, 1983; Kruglanski & Webster,
1996; Mayseless & Kruglanski, 1987).
Epistemic motivation may also vary as a function of the situation. De Dreu and Carnevale’s (2003) review of the literature
suggests that epistemic motivation is increased when a task is
perceived as attractive (Webster, 1993) or personally involving
(Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), when one is
held accountable for one’s judgments and decisions (Eagly &
Chaiken, 1993; Lerner & Tetlock, 1999; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986;
Tetlock, 1992), and when outcomes are framed as losses (De Dreu,
Carnevale, Emans, & Van de Vliert, 1994; Dunegan, 1993). Examples of conditions that have been shown to decrease epistemic
motivation include environmental noise (Kruglanski & Webster,
1991), mental fatigue (Webster, Richter, & Kruglanski, 1996),
time pressure (De Dreu, 2003; Freund, Kruglanski, & Shpitzajzen,
1985; Heaton & Kruglanski, 1991; Jamieson & Zanna, 1989;
Kruglanski & Freund, 1983; Sanbomatsu & Fazio, 1990), and
power (Fiske, 1993; Fiske & Dépret, 1996; Goodwin, Gubin,
Fiske, & Yzerbyt, 2000; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987).
The consequences of having high versus low epistemic motivation have been investigated in a large number of contexts, resulting

<-----Page 2----->VAN KLEEF, DE DREU, AND MANSTEAD

512

in convergent evidence as to its effects on a multitude of dependent
variables. Among other things, heightened epistemic motivation
has been shown to stimulate hypothesis generation (Mayseless &
Kruglanski, 1987), decrease the tendency to assimilate judgments
to primed constructs (Ford & Kruglanski, 1995), decrease the
selective use of information (Stuhlmacher & Champagne, 2000),
reduce judgmental confidence (e.g., Kruglanski & Webster, 1991),
discourage the use of stereotypes and heuristics (e.g., De Dreu,
2003; De Dreu, Koole, & Oldersma, 1999; Fiske & Neuberg,
1990; Kruglanski & Freund, 1983), focus information search on
diagnostic rather than prototypical information (Kruglanski &
Mayseless, 1988), decrease the support for chosen alternatives
(Zakay, 1993), reduce the tendency to reject opinion deviates
(Kruglanski & Webster, 1991), reduce the reliance on fixed-pie
perceptions in negotiations (De Dreu, 2003; De Dreu, Koole, &
Steinel, 2000), and increase the tendency to engage in systematic
information processing (De Dreu, 2003; De Dreu et al., 1999;
Mayseless & Kruglanski, 1987). This list is by no means exhaustive, but it suffices to characterize the general effect of epistemic
motivation, which is to increase individuals’ deliberate, thoughtful,
and systematic information processing. This brief overview also
reveals that previous research on epistemic motivation has not
addressed the potential influence of these variables on the way in
which individuals process and act on other people’s emotions. The
aim of the present research is to fill this void by investigating the
moderating influence of epistemic motivation on the interpersonal
effects of anger and happiness in negotiations.

Present Research
Prior research by Van Kleef et al. (2004) on the interpersonal
effects of anger and happiness on concession making suggests that
these effects are mediated by cognitive processes that require some
degree of information processing on the part of the emotionperceiving negotiator. Negotiators monitor their opponent’s emotions, use those emotions to estimate the opponent’s limits, and
modify their demands according to the presumed location of those
limits. As a result, negotiators concede more to an angry opponent
than to a happy one. Because of the cognitive nature of this
process, it can be predicted that the effects of the opponent’s
emotions will be moderated by the focal negotiator’s motivation to
consider the strategic information that is provided by those emotions. Thus, the central proposition of the current research is that
epistemic motivation determines the extent to which negotiators
will be influenced by their opponent’s emotions. Below we report
three experiments that tested this proposition, each using a different operationalization of epistemic motivation. In Experiment 1,
participants’ dispositional need for cognitive closure was assessed,
and they were subsequently confronted with an angry, a happy, or
a nonemotional opponent. In Experiment 2, epistemic motivation
was manipulated through time pressure, and participants negotiated with either an angry or a happy counterpart. Finally, in
Experiment 3, epistemic motivation was manipulated by varying
participants’ power, and they were again confronted with an angry
or a happy opponent. To further confidence in the generalizability
of our theory and results, we decided to test our hypotheses within
different populations (undergraduate students in Experiments 1
and 2 and managers from a variety of organizations in Experiment
3). To demonstrate that our findings are not limited to one partic-

ular experimental paradigm, we tested our theory using both laboratory experiments (Experiments 1 and 2) and a scenario study
(Experiment 3).

Experiment 1
Previous research has shown that negotiators with an angry
opponent make lower demands than do those with a nonemotional
opponent, whereas those with a happy opponent make higher
demands (Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2004; Van Kleef et al., 2004). On
the basis of the literature on epistemic motivation and information
processing, we expected that this effect would be stronger for
individuals low in dispositional need for cognitive closure (i.e.,
high epistemic motivation) than for individuals high in need for
closure (i.e., low epistemic motivation). Furthermore, because of
the nature of the emotion manipulation (see below), we expected
that the effect of the opponent’s emotion for participants with a
low need for closure would become stronger after each negotiation
round (cf. Van Kleef et al., 2004). Thus, we predicted a three-way
interaction between the opponent’s emotion, the participant’s need
for closure, and negotiation round, such that only participants with
a low (as opposed to a high) need for closure would make lower
demands to an angry opponent than to a happy one, and that this
effect would become stronger after each consecutive round (Hypothesis 1).

Method
Participants and Experimental Design
A total of 115 male and female undergraduate students at the University
of Amsterdam participated either in partial fulfillment of a course requirement or for monetary compensation (10 Dutch guilders, approximately
US$4; participants who were paid did not differ in their responses from
those who received course credits). The experimental design included the
opponent’s emotion (anger vs. happiness vs. no emotion) and the participant’s need for cognitive closure (high vs. low) as between-participants
variables and demand level as the main dependent variable. Participants
were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions, and the experimenters were blind to this assignment.

Procedure
For each session, 6 to 8 participants were invited to the laboratory. On
arrival, participants were welcomed to the experiment and seated in separate cubicles in front of a computer. From that point on, all instructions,
questionnaires, and experimental tasks were presented on the computer
screen. To facilitate the manipulation of the opponent’s emotion (see
below), the experimenter led participants to believe that the purpose of the
study was to find out how knowledge about one’s opponent’s intentions
affects negotiation processes in a situation in which the negotiating parties
cannot see each other. Subsequently, they were instructed that they would
engage in a computer-mediated negotiation with another participant
(whose behavior was in fact simulated by the computer). The experiment
consisted of four parts: the assessment of need for closure, a filler task, the
negotiation, and a postnegotiation questionnaire.
Assessment of need for closure. Need for closure was assessed through
a validated (De Dreu et al., 1999) Dutch translation of the original Need for
Cognitive Closure Scale (NFCS) developed by Webster and Kruglanski
(1994). Participants received a 42-item questionnaire to be scored on
5-point Likert scales (1 ⫽ totally disagree to 5 ⫽ totally agree). The
questionnaire was introduced as a pilot study of the ways people think

<-----Page 3----->EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN NEGOTIATIONS
about different situations. Examples of items from the NFCS are (a) “I
think that having clear rules and order at work is essential for success,” (b)
“I don’t like to go into a situation without knowing what I can expect from
it,” (c) “I usually make important decisions quickly and confidently,” (d) “I
like to know what people are thinking all the time,” and (e) “I do not
usually consult many different opinions before forming my own view.” To
reduce possible carryover effects from the need for closure assessment onto
the negotiation task, we then gave participants a 5-min filler task that
consisted of a number of unrelated questions. After these questions had
been answered, the negotiation task was introduced.
Negotiation task. The negotiation task was one previously used by Van
Kleef et al. (2004) and adapted from De Dreu and Van Lange (1995; see
also Hilty & Carnevale, 1993). The task captures the main characteristics
of real-life negotiation (i.e., multiple issues differing in utility to the
negotiator, information about one’s own payoffs only, and the typical
offer– counteroffer sequence). In the current version, participants learned
that they would be assigned the role of either buyer or seller of a consignment of mobile phones (all participants were assigned to the seller role) and
that their objective was to negotiate the price, the warranty period, and the
duration of the free-service contract of the phones. Participants were then
presented with a payoff chart (see Table 1) that showed them which
outcomes were most favorable to them, and they were told that their
objective was to earn as many points as possible. As can be seen in Table
1, price for Level 9 ($110) yielded a 0 payoff and for Level 1 ($150)
yielded a 400 payoff (i.e., increments of 50 points per level). For warranty
period, Level 9 (9 months) yielded a 0 payoff, and Level 1 (1 month)
yielded a 120 payoff (i.e., increments of 15 points per level). Finally, for
duration of service contract, Level 9 (9 months) yielded a 0 payoff, and
Level 1 (1 month) yielded a 240 payoff (i.e., increments of 30 points per
level). Participants were told, “You can see that the best deal for you is
1–1–1, for a total outcome of 760 points (400 ⫹ 120 ⫹ 240).” The
corresponding payoff table for the other party was not displayed, and
participants were told only that it differed from their own.
To enhance participants’ involvement in the negotiation task, they were
informed that points would be converted to lottery tickets at the end of the
experiment, and the more points earned, the more lottery tickets obtained,
and the greater the chance of winning a 100-guilder (approximately US$
40) prize. To emphasize the mixed-motive nature of the negotiation,
participants were told that only those who reached an agreement would
participate in the lottery. Thus, on the one hand there was an incentive to
earn as many points as possible, whereas on the other hand there was an
incentive to reach an agreement.
After a short pause during which the computer supposedly assigned
buyer and seller roles to the participants, all participants were assigned the
role of seller. They were told that the buyer (i.e., the opponent) would make

the first offer and the negotiation would continue until an agreement was
reached or until time ran out. Just before the negotiation started, participants learned that an additional goal of the study was to examine the effects
of having versus not having information about the opposing negotiator’s
intentions. They read that the computer had randomly determined that they
would receive information about the intentions of the opponent without the
opponent knowing it and that the opponent would not receive information
about their intentions.
After these instructions, the negotiation started and the buyer (i.e., the
computer) made a first offer. Over the negotiation rounds the buyer
proposed the following levels of agreement (for price ⫺ warranty ⫺
service): 8 –7– 8 (Round 1), 8 –7–7 (Round 2), 8 – 6 –7 (Round 3), 7– 6 –7
(Round 4), 7– 6 – 6 (Round 5), and 6 – 6 – 6 (Round 6). Past research has
shown that this preprogrammed strategy has face validity and is seen as
intermediate in cooperativeness and competitiveness (De Dreu & Van
Lange, 1995). A demand by the participant was accepted if it equaled or
exceeded the offer the computer was about to make in the next round.
Thus, for example, if the participant demanded 7– 6 – 6 in Round 4, this
demand was accepted by the computer since its next offer (in Round 5)
would have been 7– 6 – 6. After the sixth round, the negotiation was
interrupted regardless of whether participants had reached an agreement
(cf. De Dreu & Van Lange, 1995; Van Kleef et al., 2004). Following Tripp
and Sondak (1992), participants who reached an agreement before Round
6 (n ⫽ 10) were excluded from the sample to allow for repeated-measures
analyses. (However, retaining these participants yielded a similar pattern of
results.)
Manipulation of the opponent’s emotion. In the current research, we
chose to manipulate the opposing negotiator’s emotion in the context of a
computer-mediated negotiation in which parties could not see each other
and communicated via computers (see, e.g., De Dreu & Van Lange, 1995;
Hilty & Carnevale, 1993; Moore, Kurtzberg, Thompson, & Morris, 1999).
Participants were led to believe that the purpose of the study was to find out
how knowledge about one’s opponent’s intentions affects negotiation
processes and outcomes. After the first, third, and fifth negotiation rounds,
participants received information about “the intentions of the buyer,”
which contained the manipulation of the buyer’s emotion. Participants had
to wait for about 1.5 min while the buyer was supposedly asked to reveal
what he or she intended to offer in the next round and why. After this short
wait, participants received the answer supposedly given by the buyer,
which was presented in a separate box, in a different font, and contained
some minor typing errors to enhance experimental realism. The buyer’s
intentions were held constant across conditions and contained the buyer’s
intended offer for the next round. That is, after Round 1 the buyer wrote “I
think I will offer 8 –7–7,” which would indeed be the buyer’s next offer.
The buyer’s intention information also contained an emotional statement
which constituted the experimental manipulation. It was stressed that the
buyer did not know that his or her “intentions” were revealed to the
participant. This was done to lead the participant to believe that he or she
was receiving information about the real emotions of the opponent and not
faked, inhibited, or exaggerated emotions. Thus, participants were led to
believe that the emotion statements they received reflected the emotions as
experienced by the opponent at that time and not emotions that were altered
for self-presentational or strategic reasons.
After the first negotiation round, participants in the angry-opponent
condition received the following information: “This offer makes me really
angry,” followed by the intention statement “I think I will offer 8 –7–7,”
which was the same for all conditions. In the happy opponent condition,
participants read “I am happy with this offer,” followed by the same
intention statement. In the control condition, participants only received the
intention statement. After the third and fifth negotiation rounds participants
again received an emotional statement and an intention. Table 2 displays all
statements used in the experiment. (Note that the intended offer always
matched the true offer subsequently made by the opponent.) The emotional
statements have been successfully pretested and used in previous research

(see Van Kleef et al., 2004), and they have yielded results that have been
replicated in a face-to-face setting (Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2004). Therefore,
we are confident about the external validity of the findings obtained within
this paradigm. We return to this method, and its advantages and disadvantages, in the General Discussion.
Dependent measures. The main dependent variable was level of demand in Rounds 1 through 6. To check the adequacy of the manipulation
of the opponent’s emotion, participants were asked to indicate on a 7-point
scale how angry, irritated, happy, and satisfied they thought their opponent
had been during the negotiation (e.g., “The opponent appeared angry
during the negotiation,” 1 ⫽ totally disagree to 7 ⫽ totally agree). The
items designed to measure perceived anger and irritation correlated substantially (r ⫽ .84) and were combined into a single index of perception of
the opponent’s anger. Similarly, the items pertaining to happiness and
satisfaction were combined into an index of perception of the opponent’s
happiness (r ⫽ .77).

Results

Manipulation Check
If the manipulation of the opponent’s emotion was successful,
we should find an interaction between the opponent’s emotion and
the participant’s rating of their opponent’s emotion, such that
ratings within each emotion condition are higher for the corresponding emotion than for the other emotion (i.e., a withinparticipants manipulation check) and that ratings between the
emotion conditions are higher for the intended emotion than for the
other emotion (i.e., a between-participants check). To test whether
this was the case, we submitted participants’ perceptions of the
opponent’s emotion to a 3 (opponent’s emotion: angry vs. happy
vs. nonemotional) ⫻ 2 (participant’s perception of the opponent’s
emotion: angry vs. happy) mixed-model analysis of variance with
repeated measures on the second factor. (Need for closure was also
included as an independent variable in the analysis, but yielded no
significant effects.)
Results showed the predicted interaction between the opponent’s emotion and the participants’ perception of the opponent’s
emotion, F(2, 99) ⫽ 122.45, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .71). Participants in the
angry-opponent condition rated the opponent as significantly more
angry (M ⫽ 5.71, SD ⫽ 1.64) than did participants in the happy
opponent (M ⫽ 1.91, SD ⫽ 0.90) or nonemotional opponent (M ⫽
2.81, SD ⫽ 1.12) conditions, all three means differing from each
other at p ⬍ .05 according to a Tukey’s honestly significant
difference (HSD) multiple-range test. Similarly, participants with a
happy opponent rated the opponent as happier (M ⫽ 5.20, SD ⫽
1.22) than did participants with an angry (M ⫽ 1.81, SD ⫽ 0.86)
or a nonemotional (M ⫽ 3.48, SD ⫽ 1.15) opponent. Again, all
three means differed from each other at p ⬍ .05. Further, pairedsample t tests revealed that ratings within the different emotion
conditions were indeed higher for the intended emotion than for
the other emotion: Participants in the angry-opponent condition
rated their opponents as more angry than happy (M ⫽ 5.71 vs.
M ⫽ 1.81), t(34) ⫽ 10.20, p ⬍ .01, and those in the happy
opponent condition rated their opponents as more happy than
angry (M ⫽ 5.20 vs. M ⫽ 1.91), t(37) ⫽ 10.76, p ⬍ .01. In the
nonemotional opponent condition there was no significant difference. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no main effect of
the opponent’s emotion and no interaction, Fs ⬍ 1, ns. Together,
these results indicate that the manipulation of the opponent’s
emotion was successful.

Treatment of the Data

Demand Level

Following Kruglanski et al.’s (1997) recommendation, we combined the responses on the 42 items of the NFCS into an aggregate
score, on which a median split was performed. The NFCS has
good internal reliability (␣ ⫽ .83), and the median split (Mdn ⫽
2.95) yielded 13 to 20 participants per condition. Overall ratings
on the NFCS did not differ across the three emotion conditions
(anger: M ⫽ 2.89, SD ⫽ 0.33; happiness: M ⫽ 2.90, SD ⫽ 0.43;
no emotion: M ⫽ 3.02, SD ⫽ 0.34), F(2, 102) ⫽ 1.39, ns.
The offers made by participants in each round were transformed
into an index revealing the negotiator’s total level of demand for
each negotiation round (i.e., the number of points demanded in that
round, summed across the three negotiation issues of price, warranty, and service; see Table 1). All analyses were computed using
the full-factorial design.

Demands in Rounds 1 through 6 were submitted to a 3 (opponent’s emotion: anger vs. happiness vs. no emotion) ⫻ 2 (participant’s need for closure: high vs. low) mixed-model ANOVA with
the opponent’s emotion and participant’s need for closure as
between-participants variables and demands in Rounds 1 through
6 as a repeated-measures variable (a regression analysis with need
for closure as a continuous variable yielded results similar to those
reported below). Recall that we predicted a three-way interaction
between the opponent’s emotion, the participant’s need for closure, and negotiation round, such that participants with a low (as
opposed to a high) need for closure would make lower demands
with an angry opponent than with a happy opponent and that this
effect would increase over time (cf. Van Kleef et al., 2004). To
facilitate understanding of our findings, we first report main effects

<-----Page 5----->EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN NEGOTIATIONS

and lower order interactions, and then turn to the results pertaining
to Hypothesis 1.
Preliminary analyses. First, ANOVA yielded a main effect of
negotiation round, F(5, 495) ⫽ 253.41, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .72),
indicating that participants’ demands declined over time (Round 1:
M ⫽ 656, SD ⫽ 74; Round 2: M ⫽ 596, SD ⫽ 83; Round 3: M ⫽
556, SD ⫽ 87; Round 4: M ⫽ 522, SD ⫽ 90; Round 5: M ⫽ 498,
SD ⫽ 99; Round 6: M ⫽ 480, SD ⫽ 104). This main effect reflects
negotiators’ tendency to decrease their demands in the course of
the negotiation.
Second, we obtained a significant interaction between the opponent’s emotion and negotiation round, F(10, 495) ⫽ 2.73, p ⬍
.01 (␩2 ⫽ .08). Inspection of the means indicated that participants
with an angry opponent conceded most between the first and sixth
negotiation rounds (distance traveled: M ⫽ 205, SD ⫽ 87), followed by participants with nonemotional opponents (distance traveled: M ⫽ 173, SD ⫽ 88). Smallest concessions were made by
participants who negotiated with a happy opponent (distance traveled: M ⫽ 151, SD ⫽ 90). This finding replicates previous research by Van Kleef et al. (2004).
Third, the analysis yielded a marginally significant interaction
between the opponent’s emotion and need for closure, F(2, 99) ⫽
2.43, p ⬍ .10 (␩2 ⫽ .05). Simple-effects analysis revealed a
significant multivariate effect of the opponent’s emotion for participants with a low need for closure, indicating that participants
with an angry counterpart placed lower average demands than did
those with a happy counterpart (M ⫽ 513, SD ⫽ 86, and M ⫽ 593,
SD ⫽ 71, respectively), F(2, 99) ⫽ 5.58, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .18).
Participants with a nonemotional opponent took an intermediate
position (M ⫽ 573, SD ⫽ 72) that did not differ significantly from
the other two conditions according to a Tukey’s HSD multiplerange test. Simple-effects analysis revealed no effect of the opponent’s emotion for participants with a high need for closure (542 ⬍
Ms ⬍ 553, 54 ⬍ SDs ⬍ 94), F(2, 99) ⬍ 1, ns.
Hypothesis test. As hypothesized, the effects described above
were qualified by a significant three-way interaction between the
opponent’s emotion, the participant’s need for closure, and negotiation round, F(10, 495) ⫽ 2.09, p ⬍ .03 (␩2 ⫽ .06), indicating

515

that the interactive effect of the opponent’s emotion and negotiation round on level of demand is moderated by participant’s need
for cognitive closure. In accordance with Hypothesis 1, simpleeffects analyses showed that the interaction between the opponent’s emotion and negotiation round was significant for participants with a low need for closure, F(10, 495) ⫽ 3.07, p ⬍ .01
(␩2 ⫽ .12), but not for participants with a high need for closure,
F(10, 495) ⫽ 1.23, ns. As can be seen from Figure 1, participants
with a low need for closure were strongly influenced by the
opponent’s emotion, causing the different emotion conditions to
diverge more after each consecutive round. Planned comparisons
revealed that by Round 6 all contrasts were significant and in the
predicted direction: Participants made lower demands to an angry
opponent than to a nonemotional one (M ⫽ 431 and SD ⫽ 80 vs.
M ⫽ 488 and SD ⫽ 115), t(49) ⫽ 1.64, p ⬍ .05 (one-tailed), and
they made higher demands to a happy opponent than to a nonemotional one (M ⫽ 549 and SD ⫽ 103 vs. M ⫽ 488 and SD ⫽
115), t(49) ⫽ 1.72, p ⬍ .05 (one-tailed). As expected, participants
with a high need for closure were unaffected by the opponent’s
emotion (both ts ⬍ 1, ns).

Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 replicate and extend previous
findings. First, we replicated Van Kleef et al.’s (2004) finding that
negotiators make lower demands to an angry opponent than to a
happy one and that this effect increases over rounds. Furthermore,
this effect was qualified by the predicted interaction with need for
cognitive closure. Participants with a low need for closure were
strongly affected by the opponent’s emotion, but those with a high
need for closure remained unaffected. These results are consistent
with the assertion that negotiators need to be motivated to consider
the opponent’s emotions, and process the strategic information that
they provide, to be influenced by them. As such, the present
findings are in line with a motivated information processing model
of the interpersonal effects of emotions.
A limitation of Experiment 1 is that epistemic motivation was
measured (by means of need for closure) rather than manipulated.

Thus, although the results are consistent with our theory, we
cannot rule out the possibility that they are caused by some
unknown third variable that we did not take into account. Furthermore, the fact that need for cognitive closure was assessed prior to
the negotiation task carries with it the possibility that, in spite of
the filler task, participants’ responses to the NFC questionnaire
may have carried over to the negotiation task and influenced their
behavior. Finally, Experiment 1 provides no direct evidence for the
mediating role of information processing. To overcome these
limitations, we conducted a second experiment in which epistemic
motivation was manipulated (through time pressure, see below),
and information processing was measured.

Experiment 2
The first objective of Experiment 2 was to replicate the findings
obtained in Experiment 1 in a context with situationally induced
epistemic motivation. Of the many variables that affect epistemic
motivation, time pressure is one of the most well-known (De Dreu,
2003; Freund et al., 1985; Heaton & Kruglanski, 1991; Jamieson
& Zanna, 1989; Kruglanski & Freund, 1983; Sanbomatsu & Fazio,
1990). Kruglanski and Freund (1983) reviewed evidence suggesting that time pressure intensifies the tendency to seek cognitive
closure, which negatively affects information processing depth and
causes individuals to fall prey to, among other things, primacy
effects, ethnic stereotyping, and numerical anchoring. In a negotiation study, De Dreu (2003) showed that time pressure reduces
individuals’ (self-reported) motivation to process information and
increases the reliance on inadequate decision heuristics. On the
basis of these findings and the results of Experiment 1, we hypothesized that time pressure would moderate the interpersonal
effects of anger and happiness on concession making. Thus, we
predicted that, over negotiation rounds, negotiators would make
increasingly lower demands to an angry opponent than to a happy
opponent, but only under low (rather than high) time pressure
(Hypothesis 2).
The second objective was to shed more light on the process
underlying the moderating effect of epistemic motivation. As
discussed in the introduction, research has shown that under high
time pressure less systematic information processing takes place
(e.g., Carnevale, O’Connor, & McCusker, 1993; De Dreu, 2003;
Kruglanski & Freund, 1983). Consistent with this finding, research
on time pressure in negotiation has documented that high levels of
time pressure typically result in less integrative agreements (e.g.,
Carnevale & Lawler, 1986; Druckman, 1994; Pruitt & Drews,
1969; Yukl, Malone, Hayslip, & Pamin, 1976), reflecting the fact
that information about the other party’s preferences is less well
processed under conditions of high time pressure. In a similar vein,
De Dreu (2003) found that time pressure promoted a motivated
closing of the mind, which resulted in a reduced motivation to
encode new, relevant information about the opponent’s preferences and priorities. Together, these findings strongly suggest that
negotiators are less likely to engage in systematic information
processing when there is high rather than low time pressure. Thus,
building on the assumption that negotiators need to process the
information that is provided by the opponent’s emotions to be
influenced by them, we predicted that the interpersonal effects of
anger and happiness on participants’ concessions in the course of
the negotiation (“distance traveled”) would be moderated by time

pressure (cf. Hypothesis 2) and that this moderating effect would
in turn be mediated by participants’ degree of information processing (Hypothesis 3).

Method
Participants and Experimental Design
A total of 103 male and female undergraduate students at the University
of Amsterdam participated in the study either in partial fulfillment of a
course requirement or for monetary compensation (7 euros, approximately
US$7; participants who received monetary compensation did not differ in
their responses from those who received course credits). The 2 ⫻ 2
factorial design included the emotion of the opponent (anger vs. happiness)
and time pressure (high vs. low) as between-participants variables and
demand level as the main dependent variable. The participants were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions.

Procedure
The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1, except for the fact that
need for closure was manipulated through time pressure, rather than
measured. Twelve participants reached an agreement before the sixth round
of the negotiation and were dropped from the analyses (cf. Tripp &
Sondak, 1992). However, including these participants in the analyses did
not change the pattern of results.
Manipulation of time pressure. Before the start of the negotiation,
participants were told that they would be allowed 10 min to complete the
negotiation. In the low time pressure condition, it was added that past
research using this negotiation task had shown that 10 min is “plenty of
time to reach an agreement” and that there is “no need to hurry.” In the high
time pressure condition, participants were told that past research had shown
that 10 min is “barely enough time” to reach an agreement and that they
should “keep this in mind” during the negotiation. Just before the negotiation started, this information was briefly repeated (“You have 10 minutes
to reach an agreement, which is [plenty of time] / [rather tight]”). Similar
manipulations of time pressure have been successfully used in the past by
De Dreu (2003) and Mosterd and Rutte (2000).
Dependent measures. As in Experiment 1, participants’ demands in
Rounds 1 through 6 were transformed into an index of the participant’s
total level of demand in each round. Additionally, participants completed
a postnegotiation questionnaire, which included manipulation checks as
well as a number of items designed to measure participants’ appraisal of
the opponent’s limit, information processing, and, for exploratory purposes, satisfaction with the negotiation and willingness to engage in future
interaction. All items were scored on 7-point Likert scales, ranging from
1 ⫽ totally disagree to 7 ⫽ totally agree (except where otherwise
indicated).
Compared with Experiment 1, we used two additional items for the
manipulation check of the opponent’s emotion (“The opponent appeared
aggravated during the negotiation” and “The opponent appeared joyful
during the negotiation”). Thus, participants’ perceptions of the opponent’s
anger were now measured with three items, which were averaged into a
single index of perception of the opponent’s anger (␣ ⫽ .95). Participants’
perceptions of the opponent’s happiness were also measured with three
items, which were combined into an index of perception of the opponent’s
happiness (␣ ⫽ .93).
The manipulation of time pressure was checked with six items. We
included one item to check whether participants correctly recalled the
instructions they had received regarding negotiation time (“According to
prior research, is 10 minutes usually enough time to complete the negotiation?”; 1 ⫽ definitely not to 7 ⫽ definitely). The remaining five items
measured to what extent participants actually experienced time pressure
during the negotiation (e.g., “During the negotiation I felt that I had only

<-----Page 7----->EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN NEGOTIATIONS
limited time to think”; “During the negotiation I had enough time to make
my decisions,” reverse scored; “During the negotiation I felt that I had to
hurry”). The five items were combined into an Experienced Time Pressure
Scale (␣ ⫽ .91).
Participants’ estimates of the opponent’s limits were measured using six
items, two for each issue (“What do you think was the buyer’s lowest
acceptable offer on [price / warranty / service]?”; “How far do you think
the buyer would be prepared to go on [price / warranty / service]?”).
Responses could range from 1 (extremely low limit) to 9 (extremely high
limit; see Table 1). The six items were averaged into a single index of
appraisal of the opponent’s limit (␣ ⫽ .84).
Information processing was assessed by eight items (e.g., “During the
negotiation, I hardly thought about my demands,” reverse scored; “During
the negotiation, I paid a lot of attention to the information about the buyer’s
intentions”; “During the negotiation, I made my decisions without thinking
too much,” reverse scored; “During the negotiation, I tried to consider all
the available information before placing a demand”). The items were
averaged into an index of participant’s information processing (␣ ⫽ .77).1
As a more indirect and unobtrusive measure of information processing, we
also calculated the net amount of time participants spent negotiating. This
was done by recording the total negotiation time (in seconds) over the six
rounds of the negotiation and then subtracting forced waiting times. The
resulting index provides an objective indication of the amount of time
participants spent thinking about their opponent’s emotion and about their
own strategy. This index was significantly positively correlated with selfreported information processing (r ⫽ .34, p ⬍ .01).
Participants’ satisfaction with the negotiation was measured by two
items (“I am satisfied with the course of the negotiation” and “I have a
good feeling about the negotiation”), resulting in a two-item index of
satisfaction with the negotiation (r ⫽ .71). Willingness to engage in future
interaction with the opponent was assessed with three items (“I would be
interested in negotiating again with this buyer”; “I would like to avoid
future negotiation with the buyer,” reverse scored; “I would like to do
business with the same buyer in the future”). These three items were
combined into an index of desire for future interaction (␣ ⫽ .86).

Results
Manipulation Checks
Opponent’s emotion. The adequacy of the manipulation of the
opponent’s emotion was checked in the same way as in Experiment 1. Thus, we conducted a 2 (opponent’s emotion: angry vs.
happy) ⫻ 2 (participant’s perception of opponent’s emotion: angry
vs. happy) ANOVA, with repeated measures on the second variable. (Time pressure was also included in the analysis; this yielded
no significant effects.) Again, results revealed an interaction between the opponent’s emotion and participants’ perceptions of the
opponent’s emotion, F(1, 87) ⫽ 300.60, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .78).
Participants in the angry-opponent condition rated their opponents
as significantly more angry (M ⫽ 5.74, SD ⫽ 1.26) than did those
in the happy-opponent condition (M ⫽ 1.99, SD ⫽ 0.94). Similarly, participants with a happy opponent rated the opponent as
happier (M ⫽ 4.78, SD ⫽ 1.14) than did those with an angry
opponent (M ⫽ 1.96, SD ⫽ 0.78). Furthermore, paired-sample t
tests showed that participants in the angry-opponent condition
rated the opponent as more angry than happy (M ⫽ 5.74 vs. M ⫽
1.96), t(43) ⫽ 14.07, p ⬍ .01, and that participants in the happyopponent condition rated the opponent as more happy than angry
(M ⫽ 4.78 vs. M ⫽ 1.99), t(48) ⫽ 10.74, p ⬍ .01.
Time pressure. The adequacy of the time pressure manipulation was checked using the instruction check and the experienced

517

time pressure index. ANOVA on the instruction check revealed
that participants in the low time pressure condition thought that 10
min would be plenty of time to complete the negotiation (M ⫽
6.31, SD ⫽ 1.10), whereas those in the high time pressure condition thought that 10 min would be rather tight (M ⫽ 2.03, SD ⫽
1.14), F(1, 87) ⫽ 327.79, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .79). Furthermore,
ANOVA on the experienced time pressure index showed that
participants in the high time pressure condition actually experienced more time pressure (M ⫽ 4.21, SD ⫽ 1.42) than did
participants in the low time pressure condition (M ⫽ 2.44, SD ⫽
1.12), F(1, 87) ⫽ 8.53, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .09). We found no main
effect of emotion and no interaction. Thus, it can be concluded that
the manipulation of time pressure was successful.

Demand Level
Demands in Rounds 1 to 6 were submitted to a 2 (opponent’s
emotion: anger vs. happiness) ⫻ 2 (time pressure: high vs. low)
mixed-model ANOVA with the opponent’s emotion and time
pressure as between-participants variables and demands in Rounds
1 to 6 as a repeated-measures variable. Hypothesis 2 predicted a
three-way interaction between the opponent’s emotion, time pressure, and negotiation round, such that over time participants would
make increasingly lower demands when dealing with an angry as
opposed to a happy opponent, but only under low (rather than
high) time pressure. As in Experiment 1, we first report lower
order effects, and subsequently, we turn to the actual hypothesis
tests.
Preliminary analyses. As in Experiment 1, ANOVA revealed
the typical main effect of negotiation round, F(5, 435) ⫽ 181.63,
p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .68), indicating that participants’ demands declined
over time (Round 1: M ⫽ 645, SD ⫽ 83; Round 2: M ⫽ 581, SD ⫽
91; Round 3: M ⫽ 537, SD ⫽ 90; Round 4: M ⫽ 513, SD ⫽ 89;
Round 5: M ⫽ 485, SD ⫽ 94; Round 6: M ⫽ 459, SD ⫽ 92).
Further, ANOVA yielded a significant interaction between the
opponent’s emotion and negotiation round, F(5, 435) ⫽ 2.44, p ⬍
.05 (␩2 ⫽ .04). Consistent with previous research by Van Kleef et
al. (2004) and with the results of Experiment 1, participants with
an angry opponent conceded more in the course of the negotiation
(distance traveled: M ⫽ 209, SD ⫽ 98) than did participants with
a happy opponent (distance traveled: M ⫽ 165, SD ⫽ 102).
Finally, results showed a marginally significant interaction between the opponent’s emotion and time pressure, F(1, 87) ⫽ 2.83,
p ⬍ .10 (␩2 ⫽ .04). Simple-effects analysis revealed a significant
multivariate effect of the opponent’s emotion in the low time
pressure condition, indicating that average demands in Rounds 1 to
6 were lower for participants who negotiated with an angry opponent than for those who dealt with a happy opponent (M ⫽ 519,
SD ⫽ 64, and M ⫽ 556, SD ⫽ 92, respectively), F(1, 87) ⫽ 2.88,
p ⬍ .05 (␩2 ⫽ .05). In the high time pressure condition, there was

A confirmatory factor analysis revealed that experienced time pressure
and information processing are separate constructs. The five items designed to measure experienced time pressure loaded on one factor, with
factor loadings ranging from .83 to .90 and discriminant factor loadings
ranging from ⫺.17 to .11. The eight items measuring information processing all loaded on the other factor, with factor loadings between .51 and .89
and discriminant coefficients between ⫺.15 and .05.

no significant effect of the opponent’s emotion on demands (M ⫽
546, SD ⫽ 78 and M ⫽ 528, SD ⫽ 74), F(1, 87) ⬍ 1, ns.
Hypothesis test. As predicted, ANOVA produced a significant
three-way interaction between the opponent’s emotion, time pressure, and negotiation round, F(5, 435) ⫽ 2.84, p ⬍ .02 (␩2 ⫽ .05).
Consistent with Hypothesis 2, simple-effects analysis revealed a
highly significant Emotion ⫻ Round interaction in the low time
pressure condition, F(5, 435) ⫽ 5.78, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .20) but not
in the high time pressure condition, F(5, 435) ⬍ 1, ns. As can be
seen from Figure 2, under low time pressure participants conceded
more to an angry opponent than to a happy one, whereas under
high time pressure there was no difference.
To facilitate mediation analysis (see below), we also analyzed
the demand-level data by calculating a distance-traveled index
(demand in Round 1 ⫺ demand in Round 6; for discussions, see
De Dreu et al., 1999, and Pruitt, 1981). This distance-traveled
index yielded results similar to those described above. A marginally significant main effect of the opponent’s emotion showed that
participants with an angry opponent conceded more between the
first and sixth rounds than did those with a happy opponent (M ⫽
209, SD ⫽ 98 vs. M ⫽ 165, SD ⫽ 102), F(1, 87) ⫽ 3.44, p ⬍ .07
(␩2 ⫽ .04), and this main effect was qualified by a significant
interaction between emotion and time pressure, F(1, 87) ⫽ 3.94,
p ⬍ .05 (␩2 ⫽ .05). Simple-effects analysis revealed that participants who negotiated under low time pressure were strongly influenced by the opponent’s emotions, conceding more to an angry
opponent than to a happy one (M ⫽ 222, SD ⫽ 83 vs. M ⫽ 141,
SD ⫽ 86), F(1, 87) ⫽ 8.54, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .19). By contrast,
participants who negotiated under high time pressure remained
unaffected by the opponent’s emotion (M ⫽ 191, SD ⫽ 116, and
M ⫽ 194, SD ⫽ 114, respectively), F(1, 87) ⬍ 1, ns.2

processing than did participants in the high time pressure condition
(M ⫽ 4.49, SD ⫽ 0.51 vs. M ⫽ 3.61, SD ⫽ 0.57), F(1, 87) ⫽ 7.89,
p ⫽ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .08). ANOVA revealed no main effect of the
opponent’s emotion and no interaction, Fs ⬍ 1, ns. Analysis of the
time consumed index revealed that participants in the high time
pressure condition spent less time thinking (M ⫽ 131, SD ⫽ 47)
than did those in the low time pressure condition (M ⫽ 160, SD ⫽
84), F(1, 87) ⫽ 3.86, p ⬍ .05 (␩2 ⫽ .05). There was no effect of
emotion on time consumed (F ⬍ 1, ns) and no interaction (F ⫽
1.80, ns). We also analyzed participants’ appraisal of the opponent’s limits as an indirect way of assessing their degree of
information processing (cf. Van Kleef et al., 2004). This analysis
revealed a marginally significant main effect of the opponent’s
emotion, showing that participants with an angry opponent judged
the other’s limit to be higher (M ⫽ 4.97, SD ⫽ 0.63) than did those
with a happy opponent (M ⫽ 4.76, SD ⫽ 0.90), F(1, 87) ⫽ 3.06,
p ⫽ .084 (␩2 ⫽ .03). More important, the analysis revealed a
significant interaction between the opponent’s emotion and time
pressure, F(1, 87) ⫽ 6.47, p ⬍ .02 (␩2 ⫽ .07). Simple-effects
analyses showed that participants’ estimates of the opponent’s
limits were strongly influenced by the opponent’s emotion in the
low time pressure condition (M ⫽ 5.28 and SD ⫽ 0.47 for anger
vs. M ⫽ 4.58 and SD ⫽ 0.91 for happiness), F(1, 87) ⫽ 7.75, p ⬍
.01 (␩2 ⫽ .19) but not in the high time pressure condition (M ⫽
4.77 and SD ⫽ 0.64 for anger vs. M ⫽ 4.90 and SD ⫽ 0.88 for
happiness), F(1, 87) ⬍ 1, ns. This finding provides additional
evidence for the validity of the information processing measure
because it suggests that participants under high time pressure
thought less deeply about the other’s emotion than did those under
low time pressure.

Information Processing
In line with Hypothesis 3, ANOVA showed that information
processing was affected by time pressure. As predicted, participants in the low time pressure condition reported more information

Analysis of covariance with the opponent’s emotion and time pressure
as the independent variables, demand in Round 6 as the dependent variable,
and demand in Round 1 as a covariate produced similar results.

<-----Page 9----->EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN NEGOTIATIONS

Mediation Analysis
Hypothesis 3 predicted that time pressure would moderate the
effects of the opponent’s emotion on participants’ concession
making through its impact on participants’ degree of information
processing. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of
regression analyses, using the distance-traveled index as the dependent variable. This index was preferred over an averagedemand index because it captures the decrease in demands over the
course of the negotiation, and as such, it is more compatible with
the three-way interaction between emotion, time pressure, and
negotiation round. Furthermore, average demand is a highly conservative measure, because it includes the first negotiation round
where no effects are to be expected (since the first emotion
manipulation is introduced after Round 1). ANOVAs on the
distance-traveled index produced results that are fully compatible
with the repeated-measures analyses (see above), and therefore we
are confident that the index constitutes a valid measure of concession behavior.
To test the predicted pattern of mediation (see Figure 3), we
followed R. M. Baron and Kenny’s (1986) procedure, performing
three separate regression analyses. Because the original predictor
(time pressure) is interactively related to the dependent variable
(distance traveled), the proposed mediator (information processing) is also interactively related to the dependent variable (Hull,
Tedlie, & Lehn, 1992). The proper control is then formed by taking
the “covariate interaction” between the mediator (information processing) and the independent variable (opponent’s emotion). To
establish mediation, we should find a main effect of time pressure
on information processing and an interaction between the opponent’s emotion and time pressure on distance traveled. Finally, the

519

interaction between the opponent’s emotion and time pressure
should be significantly reduced when the covariate interaction
(opponent’s emotion by information processing) is controlled for
(see Hull et al., 1992, for an insightful explanation of the rationale
underlying this analysis; see also Stevens, 1996).
In the first step, we entered the opponent’s emotion, time
pressure (both dummy coded), and their interaction into the regression equation to predict distance traveled. This analysis
showed a significant effect of emotion, ␤ ⫽ .22, p ⬍ .04, and an
interaction between emotion and time pressure, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.23, p ⬍ .02
(in Figure 3 these effects are represented by ␤1 and ␤2, respectively). In the second step, we used time pressure to predict
information processing and again found a significant regression,
␤ ⫽ ⫺.29, p ⬍ .01 (␤3 in Figure 3). In the third analysis, the
interaction between emotion and time pressure (including both
main effects) and the covariate interaction between emotion and
information processing (including the main effect of information
processing) were simultaneously entered into the equation to predict distance traveled. This analysis produced a significant effect
of the covariate interaction (Emotion ⫻ Information Processing)
on distance traveled, ␤ ⫽ .28, p ⬍ .01 (␤4 in Figure 3), and the
originally significant interaction between emotion and time pressure was reduced to nonsignificance, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.13, ns. A Sobel test
indicated that the reduction in the regression weight was significant (Z ⫽ 1.98, p ⬍ .05; see Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998).
These results are in line with Hypothesis 3, and they support the
conclusion that time pressure moderates the interpersonal effects
of anger and happiness on concessions because it decreases negotiators’ degree of information processing.3

Satisfaction With the Negotiation and Desire for Future
Interaction
Exploratory analyses revealed that participants with a happy
opponent were more satisfied with the negotiation than participants with an angry opponent (M ⫽ 4.43, SD ⫽ 1.24 vs. M ⫽ 3.65,
SD ⫽ 1.51), F(1, 87) ⫽ 7.27, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .08). Participants with
a happy opponent also reported a greater willingness to engage in
future negotiation with the same party than did participants with an
angry opponent (M ⫽ 4.77, SD ⫽ 1.25 vs. M ⫽ 3.03, SD ⫽ 1.50),
F(1, 87) ⫽ 35.55, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .29).

Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 corroborate our hypotheses. As
predicted, time pressure moderated the effects of anger and happiness on demands and concessions: Participants with an angry
opponent placed larger demands and made smaller concessions
than did those with a happy opponent, but only under low rather
than high time pressure. Furthermore, Experiment 2 showed that
this moderating effect of time pressure was mediated by informaFigure 3. A motivated information processing model of the interpersonal
effects of anger and happiness. Standardized regression coefficients are
presented. ␤1 refers to the main effect of the opponent’s emotion on
distance traveled; ␤2 refers to the interaction between opponent’s emotion
and time pressure on distance traveled; ␤3 refers to the effect of time
pressure on information processing; ␤4 refers to the covariate interaction
between information processing and opponent’s emotion on distance traveled. *p ⬍ .05. **p ⬍ .01.

We report analyses with distance traveled as the dependent variable
because this index is most compatible with the three-way interaction
between emotion, time pressure, and negotiation round (i.e., it reflects
concession behavior over time). Hierarchical regression analyses with
demand in Round 6 as the dependent variable and demand in Round 1 as
a covariate (entered in Step 1) yielded similar results and identical conclusions as the regression analyses based on the distance-traveled index.

tion processing. Under low time pressure, participants thoroughly
scrutinized the information about the opponent’s emotions, and
they modified their demands and concessions accordingly. By
contrast, participants who negotiated under high time pressure
engaged in less thorough information processing, and as a result,
they were not influenced by the opponent’s emotional state. Finally, exploratory analyses indicated that anger (compared with
happiness) decreases negotiators’ satisfaction with the negotiation
as well as their willingness to engage in future interaction with the
opponent.
There are some limitations associated with the self-report measure of information processing that was used in this experiment.
One is that it may be difficult for individuals to get full access to,
and reliably evaluate, their own cognitive processes. Furthermore,
the information processing scale was administered after the negotiation and not during the negotiation. We explicitly decided not to
ask participants about their information processing activity during
the negotiation because we suspected that doing so would influence their processing strategy and thereby confound the results.
These limitations notwithstanding, we are confident about the
validity of the information processing measure for three reasons.
First, similar self-report measures of information processing have
been used in previous research, yielding consistent results. For
example, De Dreu et al. (1999) found that participants with a high
dispositional need for cognitive closure reported less thorough
information processing than did those with a low need for closure.
Furthermore, De Dreu (2003) found that participants’ self-reported
information processing was affected by time pressure, with participants under high time pressure reporting less thorough information processing than those under low time pressure. Thus,
self-report measures of information processing are influenced by
dispositional and situational factors in a predictable and theoretically meaningful way.
Second, our findings pertaining to self-reported information
processing are compatible with those obtained for the amount of
time spent thinking, which constitutes an objective and unobtrusive measure of information processing during the negotiation (see
De Dreu, 2003). Time spent thinking was affected by the time
pressure manipulation analogous to self-reported information processing, and both measures were significantly positively
correlated.
Third, the validity of the Information Processing Scale is supported by the results pertaining to participants’ appraisals of the
opponent’s limit. Previous research has shown that the opponent’s
emotion influences participants’ demands through their appraisal
of the other’s limits. Negotiators believe angry opponents to have
a high limit and happy opponents to have a low limit, and therefore, they concede more to an angry opponent than to a happy one.
However, this effect only occurs when it is in the negotiator’s
strategic interest to think about the other’s emotion (Van Kleef et
al., 2004). In line with this finding, the results of the present
experiment show that the effect of the opponent’s emotion on the
participant’s appraisal of the opponent’s limit is moderated by time
pressure: Negotiators with an angry opponent judge the opponent’s
limit to be higher than do negotiators with a happy opponent, but
only under low time pressure. Under high time pressure the opponent’s emotions do not influence participants’ appraisals of the
opponent’s limits. This finding suggests that individuals under
high time pressure think less deeply about the implications of the

opponent’s emotions, and it provides additional support for the
conclusion that epistemic motivation moderates the interpersonal
effects of anger and happiness on concessions through its influence
on participants’ information processing.

Experiment 3
Together, Experiments 1 and 2 strongly suggest that the degree
to which negotiators are influenced by their opponent’s emotional
state depends on their epistemic motivation—negotiators with a
high epistemic motivation are more likely than those with a low
epistemic motivation to consider the information that is conveyed
by the opponent’s emotion, and they are therefore more likely to
act on it than are those with a low epistemic motivation. Although
these results are consistent with a motivated information processing model of the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness in
negotiations, it is important to consider an alternative account for
our findings.
So far we have investigated the moderating influence of epistemic motivation on the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness by examining dispositionally based need for cognitive closure (Experiment 1) and situationally induced time pressure (Experiment 2). Although both need for cognitive closure and time
pressure effectively induce variation in epistemic motivation, they
may also have inadvertently introduced an urgency tendency—an
inclination to attain closure as soon as possible (Kruglanski &
Webster, 1996). Thus, it is possible that, apart from influencing
participants’ degree of information processing, our operationalizations of epistemic motivation in Experiments 1 and 2 introduced
the additional motive of finishing the negotiation as quickly as
possible. One could argue that the observed interaction effects
resulted from there being only one condition in each experiment in
which there was no compelling reason to decrease demands (i.e.,
the low need for closure/low time pressure–happy opponent condition). Participants in the other conditions either had an angry
opponent or a goal of finishing quickly.
Although this alternative explanation is difficult to reconcile
with the information processing data and the mediation test reported in Experiment 2, we decided to conduct a third experiment
in which we manipulated epistemic motivation without simultaneously introducing an incentive to finish the negotiation quickly.
One variable that does exactly this and that is highly relevant in
negotiation, is power. Power can be broadly defined as the capacity to exert influence on other people (Bacharach & Lawler, 1981;
Kelley & Thibaut, 1978). Although power may derive from a
variety of “power bases” (French & Raven, 1959), such as someone’s position within a group or organization or the possession of
valuable resources, such as expertise (Lee & Tiedens, 2002; Podsakoff & Schriescheim, 1985; Yukl & Falbe, 1991), it is the mutual
dependence of individuals that allows power to occur. In exchange
relations (such as negotiations) between two persons A and B, B’s
dependence on A increases with the value of the benefits A can
give B, and it decreases with B’s access to alternative sources for
those benefits (Bacharach & Lawler, 1981; Emerson, 1972; Kelley
& Thibaut, 1978). Accordingly, in some negotiation studies power
has been operationalized as the availability of alternatives (e.g.,
Brett, Pinkley, & Jackofsky, 1996; Giebels, De Dreu, & Van de
Vliert, 1998, 2000; Pinkley, 1995; Pinkley, Neale, & Bennett,
1994). In Experiment 3 we used a similar manipulation of power,

<-----Page 11----->EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN NEGOTIATIONS

providing half of the participants with plenty of alternatives to an
agreement with the current negotiation partner, whereas the other
half were given no alternatives whatsoever.
Power in negotiation has been shown to increase a negotiator’s
limit (Pinkley, 1995; White & Neale, 1991), sense of power
(Pinkley, 1995), and eventual share of the pie (e.g., Arunachalam,
Wall, & Chan, 1998; Brett et al., 1996; Pinkley et al., 1994). Fiske
(1993; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987) argued that people pay attention to
those who control their outcomes so as to be able to predict what
will happen to them and (re)gain a sense of control. Therefore,
low-power individuals will be more motivated to attend to (information about) others than will high-power individuals (Fiske &
Dépret, 1996). There is ample evidence in support of this reasoning. For example, it has been shown that compared with lowpower individuals those with high power pay less attention to
information that is inconsistent with their initial expectations about
another person (Erber & Fiske, 1984), rely more on stereotypes
and less on individual attributes when forming impressions about
others (Goodwin et al., 2000; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987), pay less
attention to specific social stimuli (Snodgrass, 1985, 1992), and
ask less diagnostic questions aimed at acquiring accurate information about others (De Dreu & Van Kleef, 2004). In other words,
power reduces the motivation to attend to, and process, social
information about others (see Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson,
2003, for a comprehensive review of this literature).
On the basis of the research outlined above, negotiators with
high (compared to low) power can be expected to have lower
epistemic motivation and to be less motivated to consider information about their opponent’s emotions. Thus, building on previous research regarding the effects of power on information processing and on the results of Experiments 1 and 2, we predicted
that high-power negotiators would be less influenced by their
opponent’s emotions than low-power negotiators. Specifically, we
hypothesized that low-power negotiators would concede more to
an angry opponent than to a happy one, whereas high-power
negotiators would not be differentially affected by the opponent’s
emotions (Hypothesis 4).
To test this hypothesis, we conducted a scenario experiment in
which we manipulated participants’ power by varying their number of alternatives to a negotiated agreement and by subsequently
confronting them with either an angry or a happy counterpart. We
opted for a scenario approach for three reasons. First, using a
scenario allowed us to assess whether the results that we obtained
using the computer task generalize to other settings. Second, we
wanted to investigate whether our findings generalize to different
samples. Instead of using undergraduate students as participants,
Experiment 3 involved managers of three different organizations.
Third, we wanted to create a negotiation context that more closely
resembles the kind of situation that people might encounter in real
life. In real negotiations, the status of the opponent’s emotional
expressions is often unknown, and negotiators have to make inferences about whether these expressions are reliable indicators of
the opponent’s actual inner state or part of a strategic influence
attempt. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were given unambiguous and apparently reliable information about the opponent’s
emotional state. In the third experiment, we created a situation in
which it was unclear whether the opponent’s emotion was genuine
or not.

Method

Sample
The study was conducted with middle- and lower-level managers from
three different Dutch companies: a consultancy firm, a phone company,
and a firm of contractors. The HR managers of these companies were
contacted and asked to distribute the questionnaires among the employees.
Depending on the manager’s preference, the questionnaires were handed
out to the employees in person or distributed via the company e-mail.
Respondents participated in the study on a voluntary basis. They completed
the questionnaires anonymously, and they were assured that their individual responses would remain confidential. The final sample consisted of 82
respondents: 46 from the consultancy firm (response rate 46%), 27 from
the phone company (response rate 82%), and 9 from the firm of contractors
(response rate 56%). They were 50 men and 31 women (1 unknown) who
were on average 34 years old. The participants’ experience in their current
jobs ranged from 0 to 30 years, with an average of 4.5 years. The number
of people directly reporting to them varied from 1 to 5, with an average of
2. Participants reported spending on average 4 hr per month negotiating
and dealing with conflict.

Design and Procedure
The design was a 2 (opponent’s emotion: anger vs. happiness) ⫻ 2
(participant’s alternatives: abundant vs. none) full factorial, with demands
as the major dependent variable. Employees who agreed to participate in
the study received a booklet containing a brief description of the research,
a negotiation scenario, and a questionnaire. Participants who were recruited
via the e-mail received an electronic version of the document. Participants
who received a paper-and-pencil version of the study materials were
requested to return the completed questionnaire directly to the researchers
by means of the enclosed stamped addressed envelope. Those who received
the electronic version were asked to attach the file with their responses to
an e-mail message addressed to the researchers.
Negotiation task. Participants were presented with a scenario that
featured a buyer–seller negotiation in an organizational context. They were
asked to take their role seriously and to respond as if they were actually in
the situation. In the scenario, participants were given the role of a project
manager who had been assigned the task of hiring an information technology (IT) company to update and professionalize the company website.
They were told that their company preferred to invest no more than 90,000
euros (roughly equivalent to US$90,000).
Power manipulation. Power was manipulated by varying the participant’s number of alternatives to a negotiated settlement. After the general
situation had been sketched, half the participants read that a thorough
search of all the appropriate IT companies in the region had shown there to
be as many as eight good candidates (high-power condition). The other half
read that there was only one good candidate (low-power condition). Participants then learned that [one of the companies / this company] was
willing to accept the assignment for 120,000 euros. Subsequently, participants were asked to imagine that they had [randomly contacted one of the
companies / contacted the company] by phone to negotiate the price of the
assignment, and that they had just proposed to pay 90,000 euros.
Manipulation of the opponent’s emotion. Participants then read that,
just as the other party was about to respond to this offer, the other’s mobile
phone rang, that the other apologized for the disturbance, and that the other
briefly talked on the mobile phone to someone else. Participants in the
angry-opponent condition read that they overheard the following conversation: “Hey Bernard, I’m sorry, I don’t have time right now, I’m in the
middle of a negotiation with a client . . . . I just got an offer which makes
me really mad. I’ll call you back . . . . Yeah, you’re right, I’m pretty angry.
Bye!” In contrast, participants in the happy-opponent condition read that
they heard the opponent say the following: “Hey Bernard, I’m sorry, I
don’t have time right now, I’m in the middle of a negotiation with a client

<-----Page 12----->VAN KLEEF, DE DREU, AND MANSTEAD

522

. . . . I just got an offer which makes me really happy. I’ll call you back . . . .
Yeah, you’re right, I feel very good about this. Bye!”
After the emotion manipulation, participants were informed that the
opponent requested an improved offer, which was to be communicated by
electronic mail. Participants were then asked to write down the e-mail
message as they would send it to the IT company and to make sure to
mention their final offer. Finally, they were asked to complete a brief
questionnaire containing measures of their intention to concede, experienced power, manipulation checks, and ability to imagine themselves in the
situation.

Dependent Variables
The main dependent variable was the participant’s demand, as written in
the e-mail to the IT company. We asked one question to measure participants’ intention to concede (“In this situation I would be inclined to
concede to the other,” 1 ⫽ definitely not to 5 ⫽ definitely). The emotion
manipulation was checked by two items, one measuring perceived anger
(“During the conversation over the mobile phone, the other person expressed anger regarding my offer,” 1 ⫽ definitely not to 5 ⫽ definitely) and
one measuring perceived happiness (“During the conversation over the
mobile phone, the other person expressed happiness regarding my offer,”
1 ⫽ definitely not to 5 ⫽ definitely). The manipulation of the participant’s
alternatives was checked using three items (e.g., “Do you think that there
are other IT companies in your region that could professionalize the
website for a better price?,” “Are there other qualified IT companies in
your region that you could contact?”), which were averaged into an
alternatives index (␣ ⫽ .80). Experienced power was measured by five
items (e.g., “I feel that I have a powerful negotiation position”; “I feel that
I need the other person to finish the project successfully,” reverse scored;
“I feel that I am dependent on the other person,” reverse scored; “I feel
powerful in this situation”; 1 ⫽ totally disagree to 5 ⫽ totally agree).
These items were averaged into a single index of the participant’s experienced power (␣ ⫽ .73). Finally, participants were asked to what extent they
had been able to imagine themselves in the situation described in the
scenario (1 ⫽ not very well to 5 ⫽ very well).

Results
Manipulation Checks
Opponent’s emotion. The manipulation of the opponent’s
emotion was checked in the same way as in Experiments 1 and 2.
A 2 (opponent’s emotion: angry vs. happy) ⫻ 2 (participant’s
perception of opponent’s emotion: angry vs. happy) ANOVA with
repeated measures on the second factor revealed a significant
interaction between the opponent’s emotion and participants’ perceptions of the opponent’s emotion, F(1, 78) ⫽ 496.22, p ⬍ .01
(␩2 ⫽ .86). Participants in the angry-opponent condition rated the
opponent as more angry (M ⫽ 4.29, SD ⫽ 0.81) than did those in
the happy-opponent condition (M ⫽ 1.38, SD ⫽ 0.63), and participants in the happy-opponent condition rated the opponent as
happier (M ⫽ 4.53, SD ⫽ 0.55) than did those in the angryopponent condition (M ⫽ 1.43, SD ⫽ 0.83). There was no main
effect of power and no interaction (both Fs ⬍ 1, ns). Finally,
paired-sample t tests showed that participants in the angry condition rated the other as more angry than happy (M ⫽ 4.29 vs. M ⫽
1.43), t(41) ⫽ 13.16, p ⬍ .01, and that participants in the happy
condition rated the other as more happy than angry (M ⫽ 4.53 vs.
M ⫽ 1.38), t(39) ⫽ 20.43, p ⬍ .01.
Power. A significant main effect of the alternatives manipulation on the corresponding index revealed that participants in the

abundant-alternatives conditions felt that they had more alternatives (M ⫽ 4.47, SD ⫽ 0.45) than did those in the no-alternatives
conditions (M ⫽ 3.56, SD ⫽ 0.88), F(1, 78) ⫽ 33.45, p ⬍ .01
(␩2 ⫽ .30). We found no main effect of the opponent’s emotion
and no interaction (both Fs ⬍ 1, ns). Furthermore, a main effect of
the alternatives manipulation on the Experienced Power Scale
showed that participants who had abundant alternatives indeed felt
more powerful (M ⫽ 4.34, SD ⫽ 0.45) than did participants who
had no alternatives (M ⫽ 3.43, SD ⫽ 0.70), F(1, 78) ⫽ 48.14, p ⬍
.01 (␩2 ⫽ .38). Again, there was no main effect of emotion (F ⫽
1.81, ns) and no interaction (F ⫽ 2.02, ns).

Preliminary Analyses
A one-sample t test showed that participants’ ratings on the
imagination item were significantly above the scale mean (M ⫽
3.77, SD ⫽ 1.22), t(81) ⫽ 5.70, p ⬍ .01, indicating that they had
been able to imagine themselves in the situation that we presented.
Preliminary analyses revealed no effects of any of the demographic variables, so they are not discussed any further.

Demand Level
A main effect of the opponent’s emotion showed that participants with an angry opponent conceded to a higher (i.e., less
favorable) price than did those with a happy opponent (M ⫽
93,167 and SD ⫽ 4,601 vs. M ⫽ 88,956 and SD ⫽ 2,998,
respectively), F(1, 78) ⫽ 26.06, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .25). Second, a
main effect of power revealed that participants with abundant
alternatives made tougher demands than did those who had no
alternatives (M ⫽ 90,125 and SD ⫽ 2,399 vs. M ⫽ 92,054 and
SD ⫽ 5,589, respectively), F(1, 78) ⫽ 4.85, p ⬍ .03 (␩2 ⫽ .06).
Finally, and most important, both main effects were qualified by
the expected interaction between emotion and power, F(1, 78) ⫽
8.60, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .10). Consistent with Hypothesis 4, simpleeffects analysis revealed that participants conceded more to an
angry opponent than to a happy one, but only when they had no
alternatives (M ⫽ 95,136 and SD ⫽ 5,383 for anger vs. M ⫽
88,663 and SD ⫽ 3,504 for happiness), F(1, 78) ⫽ 33.07, p ⬍ .01
(␩2 ⫽ .34). Participants with abundant alternatives did not differ as
a function of the opponent’s emotion (M ⫽ 91,000 and SD ⫽
2,052 for anger vs. M ⫽ 89,250 and SD ⫽ 2,447 for happiness),
F(1, 78) ⫽ 2.23, ns.
The results pertaining to participants’ self-reported intention to
concede were consistent with those obtained for their actual demands. A main effect of emotion indicated that participants were
more inclined to concede to an angry opponent than to a happy one
(M ⫽ 2.74 and SD ⫽ 1.17 vs. M ⫽ 2.05 and SD ⫽ 0.88,
respectively), F(1, 78) ⫽ 10.63, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .12), and a main
effect of power showed that participants with abundant alternatives
were less likely to concede than were those who had no alternatives (M ⫽ 1.95 and SD ⫽ 0.88 vs. M ⫽ 2.83 and SD ⫽ 1.10,
respectively), F(1, 78) ⫽ 18.12, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .19). Again, a
significant interaction between emotion and power was obtained,
F(1, 78) ⫽ 7.63, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .09). Simple-effects analyses
revealed that participants who had no alternatives were more
inclined to concede to an angry opponent than to a happy one
(M ⫽ 3.41, SD ⫽ 1.01 and M ⫽ 2.20, SD ⫽ 0.83, respectively),
F(1, 78) ⫽ 18.57, p ⬍ .01 (␩2 ⫽ .31), whereas those with abundant

<-----Page 13----->EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN NEGOTIATIONS

alternatives did not differ as a function of the opponent’s emotion
(M ⫽ 2.00, SD ⫽ 0.86 and M ⫽ 1.90, SD ⫽ 0.91, respectively),
F(1, 78) ⬍ 1, ns.

Discussion
Building on previous research on power and epistemic motivation (e.g., De Dreu & Carnevale, 2003; Fiske, 1993; Fiske &
Dépret, 1996; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987) and on the results of
Experiments 1 and 2, we hypothesized and found that the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness on demands and concessions are moderated by power. As predicted, low-power negotiators were strongly influenced by their opponent’s emotions,
conceding more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. By
contrast, high-power negotiators were unaffected by the opponent’s emotion. These results corroborate Hypothesis 4, and they
support the motivated information processing model outlined in
the introduction.
Importantly, this additional support for the motivated information processing account also undermines the “urgency” explanation that we advanced in the introduction to Experiment 3. The
idea was that, in Experiments 1 and 2, a low epistemic motivation
(i.e., high need for closure, high time pressure) possibly went hand
in hand with a desire to end the negotiation as quickly as possible
and that perhaps a sense of urgency rather than reduced motivation
to process information is responsible for the results pertaining to
demands and concessions in the first two experiments. In Experiment 3, however, this reasoning is far less plausible because it is
difficult to see how having few or plenty of alternatives would
unequivocally increase or decrease participants’ motivation to
finish the negotiation. If anything, in Experiment 3 low epistemic
motivation is likely to have coincided with a reduced rather than
an increased urgency motivation, because having plenty of alternatives enables a negotiator to safely try and get the most out of the
negotiation without risking ending up with nothing at all. However, if one would make a case that having no alternatives (i.e.,
high epistemic motivation) produces a desire to finish the negotiation quickly, the pattern of means would be inconsistent with
those obtained in the first two experiments. Thus, although the
urgency explanation can account for some of the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it cannot account for the combined effects of
Experiments 1 to 3. In contrast, the motivated information processing model can easily explain the results of all three experiments by using the principle of epistemic motivation. The motivated information processing account thus constitutes the most
parsimonious explanation for the combined results of the present
experiments.

General Discussion
In the current research we drew on the motivated information
processing model of negotiation (De Dreu & Carnevale, 2003; see
also Kruglanski, 1989; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996) to enhance
our understanding of the interpersonal effects of emotions in
negotiation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that negotiators’ tendency
to concede more to an angry opponent than to a happy one (Van
Kleef et al., 2004) is moderated by individual differences in
epistemic motivation: Negotiators with a low dispositional need
for cognitive closure were strongly affected by the opponent’s

523

emotion, whereas those with a high dispositional need for cognitive closure were unaffected. Experiment 2 showed a similar
pattern for a situational manipulation of epistemic motivation.
Participants who negotiated under low time pressure (i.e., high
epistemic motivation) were strongly influenced by the other’s
emotion, whereas those under high time pressure (i.e., low epistemic motivation) were not. This moderating effect of time pressure was mediated by information processing. Finally, using a
different paradigm and participant population, Experiment 3 demonstrated that the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness in
negotiations are moderated by power. In line with previous research by Fiske and colleagues (Fiske, 1993; Fiske & Dépret,
1996; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987) showing that power reduces epistemic motivation, we found that low-power negotiators conceded
more to an angry counterpart than to a happy one, whereas highpower negotiators were unaffected by the other’s emotion. Taken
together, the results of these three studies provide strong support
for the proposition that a negotiator’s epistemic motivation determines the extent to which he or she will be influenced by the
opponent’s emotions. The fact that we used three different operationalizations of epistemic motivation and found consistent results
renders alternative explanations less plausible. Below we consider
the implications of these findings, discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach, and outline some avenues for future
research.

Implications and Contributions
In exploring how epistemic motivation moderates the interpersonal effects of emotions in negotiation, the present work brings
together two separate lines of research. The synthesis of these
different lines of inquiry extends our knowledge about the negotiation process, the social effects of emotions, and the role of
epistemic motivation in social interaction. Our findings are consistent with a motivated information processing approach to negotiation (see De Dreu & Carnevale, 2003; De Dreu et al., 1999,
2000), which holds that negotiators may be more or less motivated
to engage in systematic and thorough information processing,
depending on personality characteristics such as need for cognitive
closure and situational factors such as time pressure and power
(Fiske, 1993; Fiske & Dépret, 1996; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996).
Consistent with this perspective, our data show that when negotiators have a high epistemic motivation, they process the information that is conveyed by the opponent’s emotions more thoroughly,
and, as a result, the opponent’s emotional state has a stronger
impact on their behavior.
Recent research on the interpersonal effects of emotions in
negotiation has demonstrated that anger and happiness have a
profound impact on negotiation behavior (Sinaceur & Tiedens,
2004; Van Kleef et al., 2004, Experiment 1). Furthermore, these
effects have been shown to be produced by strategic considerations. Negotiators who are confronted with an angry opponent
judge the other’s limits to be high, leading them to concede quickly
so as to avoid impasse. Conversely, negotiators who are confronted with a happy opponent believe that the other has low
limits, which causes them to stand firm and make tough demands
(Van Kleef et al., 2004, Experiment 2). The present research
qualifies these findings by showing that the interpersonal effects of
emotions on negotiation behavior are moderated by epistemic

motivation: Negotiators only react to the opponent’s emotion in a
strategic way when they are motivated to consider the implications
of the other’s emotion.
The current findings also add to what we know about the effects
of emotions in social settings. Although the previous decade has
witnessed an increasing interest in the interpersonal effects of
emotions (e.g., Frijda & Mesquita, 1994; Keltner & Haidt, 1999;
Morris & Keltner, 2000; Oatley & Jenkins, 1992), little is known
about potential moderators of these effects. The present research
fills this void by showing that the interpersonal effects of emotions
are contingent on the perceiver’s motivation to actively think about
the implications of the opponent’s emotions. This finding has
interesting implications for the tactical use of emotions (cf. Barry,
1999), because it suggests that the effectiveness of the use of
emotional deception as a strategic ploy depends on whether the
target of the influence attempt is motivated to think about the
implications of the other’s emotions for his or her own goal
attainment.
In prior research, epistemic motivation has been linked to social
psychological phenomena such as impression formation, attribution, stereotyping, and language use (for a comprehensive overview, see Kruglanski & Webster, 1996) and their strategic implications in the context of conflict and negotiation (De Dreu &
Carnevale, 2003). The present research extends these findings to
the domain of emotions by showing that the interpersonal effects
of anger and happiness are moderated by epistemic motivation.
Although this finding is of importance in its own right, its relevance may extend beyond the specific effects of emotion and may
well generalize to other domains of social interaction. Despite the
fact that lay epistemic theory has been investigated in a multitude
of contexts, most support for the theory stems from settings that
involve little or no social interaction. The current study shows that
the theory also holds in settings with (simulated) interaction, and
our finding that individuals with a high epistemic motivation are
more easily influenced by others’ emotions than are individuals
with a low epistemic motivation suggests that similar moderating
effects may also obtain in other areas of social influence.
Dual-process models of human information processing distinguish between the ability to process information and the motivation to do so (see e.g., Chaiken & Trope, 1999; Smith & DeCoster,
2000). An implicit assumption of lay epistemic theory and the
motivated information processing approach is that people have
sufficient cognitive resources available to process the information
that they receive but differ in the extent to which they are motivated to process the information. This raises the question of
whether our findings are caused by differences in motivation or
differences in ability. Although our experiments were not designed
to investigate the relative effects of ability and motivation on
information processing, we believe that they can best be explained
in terms of differential motivation. First, chronic differences in
motivation to actively acquire and thoroughly scrutinize new
pieces of information (i.e., need for cognitive closure) have been
shown not to be related to measures of cognitive ability (i.e.,
intelligence; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996). Thus, the interaction
between dispositional need for closure and the opponent’s emotion
that was obtained in Experiment 1 would suggest that it is motivation, rather than ability, that moderates the interpersonal effects
of anger and happiness in negotiation.

Second, in contrast to previous research on the effects of time
pressure and information processing (e.g., Freund et al., 1985;
Heaton & Kruglanski, 1991; Kruglanski & Freund, 1983), we did
not vary the amount of time available to reach an agreement.
Rather, all participants were given the same amount of time to
negotiate, and they were told that this was either more than enough
or relatively tight. In other words, we manipulated experienced
time pressure rather than the absolute amount of time available,
suggesting that our effects can be more easily attributed to motivated closing of the mind than to a reduced cognitive capacity to
process information (for discussions, see De Dreu, 2003; Mosterd
& Rutte, 2000).
Third and foremost, the results of Experiment 3 cannot be
understood in terms of a reduced capacity to process information.
The power manipulation that was used in this experiment cannot
have influenced participants’ information processing capacity, and
yet negotiators with high power were unaffected by their opponent’s emotions, whereas those with low power were strongly
influenced. This finding can only be explained in terms of a
differential motivation to process the information conveyed by the
other’s emotion (cf. Fiske, 1993; Fiske & Dépret, 1996). Together,
these three experiments provide strong support for the assertion
that a negotiator’s motivation to engage in thorough information
processing determines the extent to which he or she will be
influenced by the opposing negotiator’s emotions.
Another interesting issue concerns the potentially differential
effects of experienced and expressed emotions. In Experiments 1
and 2, participants received information about their opponent’s
experienced emotions, which could be trusted to reflect the opponent’s true feelings. One might argue that in real life negotiators
rarely have reliable information about their opponent’s experienced emotions. Rather, they perceive some expression of emotion, and they have to make inferences as to whether this expression reflects the opponent’s real emotion or whether it is part of a
strategic influence attempt. The situation described in Experiment
3 reflected the ambiguity that is characteristic of real life emotional
expressions. Instead of giving participants reliable information
about the other’s experienced emotions, participants were confronted with the opponent’s verbal expressions of anger or happiness, without receiving information pertaining to the trustworthiness of the expressions. The results of Experiment 3 are
compatible with those of Experiments 1 and 2, suggesting that
negotiators respond in similar ways to emotions with an ambiguous status as they do to truly experienced emotions.
This conclusion is consistent with research on the correspondence bias (Jones, 1979), the fundamental attribution error (Ross,
1977), and spontaneous trait inferences (see, e.g., Uleman, Newman, & Moskowitz, 1996), in which it has been shown that
observers use other people’s apparent behavior to make inferences
about their personality or inner state. Furthermore, other research
has shown that observers are not very accurate at detecting faked
emotions but instead tend to believe that the emotions that others
pretend to be experiencing are real (e.g., DePaulo, 1992; DePaulo,
Stone, & Lassiter, 1985; Zuckerman, DePaulo, & Rosenthal,
1981). All in all, it appears that when it is unclear whether the
expressed emotions are genuine or strategic, perceivers tend to
respond as if the expressed emotions are genuine. The question of
what happens when it is clear that the other’s expressed emotions
are part of a strategic ploy awaits further research.

Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research
There are some limitations to our findings. First, there was no
face-to-face interaction. The primary focus of this research was on
generating and testing hypotheses, and therefore we made an
explicit decision to maintain as much experimental control as
possible. Although the present findings generalize across settings,
operations, and populations, they may be limited to situations
where there is no face-to-face interaction. With the upsurge of
computer-mediated negotiations (Moore et al., 1999), and the
increased reliance on other communication means than face-toface interaction (McGrath & Hollingshead, 1994), our findings
thus pertain to more and more settings. However, in light of the
proven generalizability across different paradigms of the interpersonal effects of emotions (cf. Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2004; Van
Kleef et al., 2004), we see no reason why our findings should be
limited to situations that lack face-to-face contact.
A related issue concerns the “cognitive” nature of the emotion
manipulation that was used in the present experiments. The fact
that we used verbal manipulations of emotion raises the question
of whether our findings generalize to settings in which emotions
are communicated in a different manner (e.g., nonverbally). One
could argue that the effects would be different if people were
presented with behavioral instead of cognitive emotion cues. This
possibility cannot be ruled out on the basis of the present data.
However, previous research has shown similar interpersonal effects of emotions regardless of whether a verbal (Van Kleef et al.,
2004) or nonverbal (Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2004) manipulation was
used. By analogy, the effects of epistemic motivation have been
observed in many different contexts and settings (De Dreu &
Carnevale, 2003; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996). Therefore we are
quite confident about the external validity of our findings. However, future research is needed to explore this issue in greater
depth.
Another avenue for future study concerns the long-term consequences of anger. How does anger influence the relationship
between the negotiators? Do the effects of anger persist over time
or do they diminish or even backfire in the long run? The present
findings show that negotiators with an angry opponent are less
satisfied with the negotiation and are less willing to engage in
future interaction with the same opponent than are negotiators with
a happy counterpart. These findings point to an interesting dilemma facing negotiators who anticipate future interaction. On the
one hand, negotiators may be motivated to strategically present
happiness to make a good impression and to induce or maintain a
positive interpersonal relationship. On the other hand, they may
choose to use anger to get their opponents to go along with their
preferences. Future research could investigate which of these strategies is more beneficial in the long run.

Conclusion
Consistent with the motivated information processing approach
outlined in the introduction, the present research shows that the
interpersonal effects of anger and happiness on negotiation behavior are moderated by the focal negotiator’s epistemic motivation.
When epistemic motivation is high, negotiators thoroughly scrutinize the information that resides in the opponent’s emotions, and
they act accordingly, standing firm against a happy opponent and

525

conceding to an angry opponent. However, when epistemic motivation is low, negotiators engage in shallow and nonsystematic
information processing, which renders them impervious to the
other’s emotional state. Thus, the current research suggests that the
interpersonal effects of emotions are contingent upon the perceiver’s motivation to engage in thoughtful and deliberate information
processing. The relevance of these findings is unlikely to be
limited to the negotiation setting and may well generalize to other
domains of social interdependence.
