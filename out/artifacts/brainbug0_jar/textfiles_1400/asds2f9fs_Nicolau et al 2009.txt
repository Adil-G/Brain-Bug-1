We applied quantitative genetics techniques to a sample of 851 pairs of monozygotic and 855 pairs of
dizygotic female twins to examine the inﬂuence of genetic factors on the variation across people in
opportunity recognition. We also examined the extent to which the same genetic factors contribute to
both opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur. We found substantial heritability
for opportunity recognition (0.45), with no inﬂuence of the shared environment. Moreover, we found that
53% of the phenotypic correlation between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur had a common genetic aetiology.

Introduction
Whether it is to found an Internet search engine, an airline or a
new restaurant, an important part of being an entrepreneur is
identifying an opportunity for a new business, making opportunity
recognition an important part of the entrepreneurship process. In
the last decade, scholars have given increased attention to unravelling the antecedents of opportunity recognition (e.g. Baron & Ensley, 2006; Casson & Wadeson, 2007; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Shane,
2000). One of the ﬁndings in this stream of research is that some
people are better at noticing new business opportunities than
other people, and that this superior ability makes them more likely
than other people to start businesses (Baron & Ensley, 2006).
While researchers have identiﬁed some of the factors that account for the variation across people in opportunity recognition
(Baron, 2007), to date researchers have not explored the question
of whether some people are born with a greater genetic predisposition to identify entrepreneurial opportunities, and, if they are,
whether the same genetic factors also account for the greater tendency of some people to start businesses. Moreover, previous research suggests that the genetic effects on the tendency to be an
entrepreneur could be gender-speciﬁc, impacting women far more
than men (Zhang et al., in press). In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst
empirical investigation of the genetic component of opportunity

recognition, and examine whether the covariance between opportunity recognition and the tendency of women to be entrepreneurs
is partly accounted for by genetic factors.
Investigating the genetic aetiology of opportunity recognition
and the tendency to be an entrepreneur among women is important for three reasons. First, an accurate understanding of entrepreneurship depends on the correctly ascribing the sources of
variation between people in opportunity recognition. If the identiﬁcation of new business opportunities is a necessary part of new
business creation, then researchers must account for differences
across people in their ability to recognize opportunities in order
to explain new business formation. To date, researchers have explained only a small part of this variance (Butler, 2004; Shane,
2003). Understanding the role that genetics plays in opportunity
recognition can help scholars build a more comprehensive and
integrative understanding of this phenomenon.
This is true even if the genetic component to opportunity recognition, the tendency to be an entrepreneur, and other aspects of
entrepreneurship are of the same magnitude as the genetic effects
on psychological factors. No aspect of entrepreneurship is perfectly
correlated with any psychological attribute, nor is there any theory
that holds that people with certain personality traits must be entrepreneurs. Moreover, entrepreneurship is a different phenomenon
from psychological characteristics. Therefore, the same genetic factors may inﬂuence psychological characteristics and the tendency
to be an entrepreneur and opportunity recognition or they may
not. Just as researchers cannot assume that leadership, job satisfaction, job preferences, and so on, have a genetic component because

<-----Page 1----->N. Nicolaou et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 108–117

research shows that psychological characteristics have a genetic
component, they cannot assume that entrepreneurship has a genetic component from evidence of a genetic effect on these
other phenomena. In all cases, researchers must develop and test
theory of the genetic effects on the particular phenomenon of
interest.
Second, understanding the common genetic aetiology between
opportunity recognition and the tendency to become an entrepreneur is important to suggest what, if any, interventions can be
undertaken to encourage people to create new businesses. If the
entire correlation between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur is accounted for by genetic factors,
this would suggest that we cannot inﬂuence the level of entrepreneurial exploitation that occurs in an economy by engaging in
interventions that stimulate people to, or teach people to, recognize opportunities. On the other hand, if there are no shared genetic inﬂuences between opportunity recognition and the tendency to
be an entrepreneur, then we could signiﬁcantly affect new business creation by stimulating opportunity recognition.
Third, the factors inﬂuencing the tendency of women to become
entrepreneurs may be different from those affecting their male
counterparts. Research shows that the genetic effect on the tendency to be an entrepreneur may be stronger for women than for
men (Zhang et al., in press). The differences between men and women in the strength of genetic effects on the tendency to be an
entrepreneur suggests the importance of developing and testing
gender-speciﬁc explanations for how genetics impacts different aspects of entrepreneurship.
Theory development
We propose that genetic factors inﬂuence the variation across
people in opportunity recognition. We also propose that the same
genetic factors that inﬂuence opportunity recognition also inﬂuence the tendency to be an entrepreneur. A common genetic aetiology for opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an
entrepreneur would depend on three factors: First, that opportunity recognition is heritable; second, that the tendency to be an
entrepreneur is heritable; and third, that a common genetic mechanism accounts for the heritability of both opportunity recognition
and the tendency to be an entrepreneur. Below we offer the arguments for why these three conditions should be true.
The heritability of opportunity recognition
Opportunity recognition, or the identiﬁcation of a chance to combine resources in a way that might generate a proﬁt, is an important
aspect of entrepreneurship (Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Shane, 2003; Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000). Because people need to identify opportunities to be entrepreneurs, skill at opportunity identiﬁcation increases
the probability that a person will become an entrepreneur (Baron &
Ensley, 2006; Casson & Wadeson, 2007; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Shane,
2000). However, all people are not equally skilled at identifying
entrepreneurial opportunities (Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003;
Baron & Ensley, 2006). In fact, researchers have identiﬁed several differences between people that are correlated with opportunity recognition, including prior information (Shane, 2000), psychological
‘‘alertness” (Gaglio & Katz, 2001), pattern recognition skills (Baron
& Ensley, 2006), and social network structure (Baron & Ozgen,
2007; Singh, Hills, Hybels, & Lumpkin, 1999).
While we know that a number of factors are correlated with
being ‘‘good” at opportunity recognition (and that individual level
variation in opportunity recognition is associated with being an
entrepreneur), the origin of these interpersonal differences has
not been completely identiﬁed. These differences might be learned,

109

or they might be the result of a person’s genetic endowment.
Although both learning and genetics are likely explanations for
individual level variation in opportunity recognition, this paper focuses on examining Ardichvili et al.’s conjecture (2003: 110) that
‘‘[t]hese individual differences may come from variations in individuals’ genetic makeup...”
The ﬁeld of entrepreneurship does not yet have a fully articulated theory for how genetics inﬂuences differences across people
in opportunity recognition, but it does have some plausible explanations. Below we examine four plausible mechanisms for these
genetic effects.1
First, genetics may affect people’s ability to identify opportunities by inﬂuencing their ability to creatively fashion business
opportunities from bits of information. Shane (2000) explains that
opportunities do not come in pre-packaged form. Rather, people
need to combine information in novel ways to identify business
opportunities. For instance, entrepreneurs might need to think of
new ways to combine resources so that their value exceeds the
cost of the resources themselves, or they might need to come up
with novel solutions to customer problems (Ardichvili et al.,
2003; Vesalainen & Pihkala, 1999). Whatever the speciﬁc information which entrepreneurs must use creatively, creativity is an
important part of opportunity recognition. In fact, in a survey of
entrepreneurs, Hills, Lumpkin, and Singh (1997) found that 90% believe that creativity is ‘‘very important” for opportunity
recognition.
The importance of creativity to opportunity recognition suggests one way that genes inﬂuence opportunity recognition. Studies show that 55% of the difference between people in creativity is
genetic (Bouchard, McGue, Hur, & Horn, 1998), with two genes –
DRD2 and TPH1 – having been found to account for 9% of the difference between people in creativity (Reuter, Roth, Holve, & Hennig, 2006). Thus, genes might facilitate opportunity recognition
by making some people more creative than others.
Second, genetics may inﬂuence people’s ability to identify
entrepreneurial opportunity by affecting their openness to experience. Openness to experience enhances opportunity recognition
because new experiences provide novel information, and facilitate
mental processes, that are helpful to identifying opportunities
(Zhao & Seibert, 2006).
Genetics affects openness to experience, accounting for between 45% and 61% of people’s differences in this personality trait
(Bouchard & Loehlin, 2001; Loehlin, 1992). Moreover, researchers
have found that individuals with certain variants of the DRD4 gene
are more open to experience than those with different versions of
the genes (Comings et al., 1999). Thus, genes might facilitate
opportunity recognition by making some people more open to
experience than others.
Third, genetics may affect people’s ability to recognize entrepreneurial opportunities by facilitating the formation of strong social
networks. Social ties facilitate opportunity recognition because
other people often provide entrepreneurs with information helpful
to the process (Ardichvili et al., 2003). Moreover, the necessary
information to identify opportunities is often distributed across a
number of sources, making broad social ties useful to accessing
all of the needed bits of information (Johansson, 2000).
Research shows that strong social ties enhance opportunity recognition. Koller found that 46% of ﬁrm founders had their business
idea suggested to them by someone with whom they had a social
tie. Hills et al. (1997) found that entrepreneurs who have broader social networks recognize more opportunities than those with
1
We focus on these four mechanisms because they could also account for a
common genetic aetiology between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be
an entrepreneur. Genetic factors could inﬂuence opportunity recognition through
other mechanisms as well.

<-----Page 2----->110

narrower social networks. Baron and Ozgen (2007) found that entrepreneurs with more ties to mentors, other industry participants and
members of trade associations, the better they were at recognizing
opportunities. And Singh et al. (1999) showed that entrepreneurs
with more diverse social ties were more likely to identify entrepreneurial opportunities than those with less diverse ties.
The strength of a person’s social network is, in part, genetic.
Researchers have found that a person’s choice of friends, number
of friends and conﬁdants, frequency of interaction with friends,
amount of social support from friends, social network denseness,
network centrality, social relationship intensity, sociability, social
avoidance, and social skills, are all affected by genetics (Bouchard
et al., 1998; Carey, 2003; Fowler, Dawes, & Christakis, 2009; Iervolino et al., 2002; Jang, Livesley, Vernon, & Jackson, 1996; Loehlin &
Gough, 1990; Manke, McGuire, Reiss, Hetherington, & Plomin,
1995; Plomin, 1994; Schnittker, 2008). Thus, genes might facilitate
opportunity recognition by giving some people better social networks than others.
Fourth, genetics may inﬂuence opportunity recognition by
affecting preferences for autonomy and job security. People with
a higher predisposition for autonomy and a lower predisposition
for job security are more interested in working for themselves,
and thus are more likely to search for entrepreneurial opportunities than other people (Shane, 2003).
The preference for both autonomy and job security are partially
genetic. Studies show that genes account for about a third of the
difference between people in both preferences (Arvey, Bouchard,
Segal, & Abraham, 1989). Thus, genes might facilitate opportunity
recognition by making some people more interested in autonomy
and less interested in job security than others.
These arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. Genetic factors inﬂuence part of the variation across
people in opportunity recognition.
The heritability of entrepreneurship
Whether entrepreneurship is measured as self-employment,
starting companies, owning one’s own business, or being involved
in the ﬁrm start-up process, recent research shows that the tendency to be an entrepreneur is partially genetic, with heritabilities
from 37% to 48%, depending on the measure. Moreover, these heritabilities are present even after taking into consideration the effects of age, income, education, marital status, race, and
immigrant status (Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, & Spector,
2008).
The genetic effect on the tendency to be an entrepreneur may
also be much stronger for women than for men. Prior research
shows substantially higher heritabilities of entrepreneurship for
women than for men (Zhang et al., in press). Researchers have
speculated that genetic effects may be more powerful for women
because there is a lower prevalence of entrepreneurship for women than for men (Brush, 1992). As a result, the situational factors
that motivate men to start businesses may not have as large an effect on women. For instance, men might be more likely to start a
company in response to the experience of working in a small business, while this experience might not trigger entrepreneurial tendencies in women. The end result is little genetic effect on the
tendency of men to become entrepreneurs, but a strong genetic effect on women (Shane, forthcoming).
Common genetic factors inﬂuencing opportunity recognition and the
tendency to be an entrepreneur
The same genetic factors that inﬂuence the tendency to be an
entrepreneur might also inﬂuence opportunity recognition. Much

research shows that similar factors are associated with both phenomena (Baron, 2007). Moreover, all of the above-mentioned
mechanisms, through which genetics affects opportunity recognition, also affect the tendency to be an entrepreneur.
First, creativity affects the tendency to be an entrepreneur. Creativity is necessary not just to identify business opportunities, but
also to ﬁgure out how to obtain resources to pursue them. Moreover, over time, the conditions facing businesses change and entrepreneurs need to come up with creative responses to those
changes (Shane, 2003).
Empirical research conﬁrms this proposition, showing that
entrepreneurs are more creative than non-entrepreneurs. Hull,
Bosley, and Udell (1982) found that business owners scored higher
on a measure of creativity than non-owners, while Caird (1991)
and Cromie and O’Donaghue (1992) found that ﬁrm owners were
more creative than the general population.
Second, openness to experience affects the tendency to be an
entrepreneur. Openness to experience provides people with a variety of information that helps them to develop new products and
organizations. Moreover, it provides them with an understanding
of a wide range of customers and customer attitudes that is useful
in running a business (Shane, 2003). Empirically, a recent metaanalysis conﬁrms that entrepreneurs are more open to experience
than managers (Zhao & Seibert, 2006).
Third, social network strength affects the tendency to be an
entrepreneur (Hills et al., 1997; Singh et al., 1999, Baron and Ozgen, 2007; Aldrich & Kim, 2007). Entrepreneurs use their social
networks to obtain ﬁnancial and human resources (Aldrich,
1999) because social relationships facilitate resource acquisition
under conditions of uncertainty and information asymmetry
(Shane, 2003). Moreover, social networks provide entrepreneurs
with useful information about many aspects of running their businesses, from government regulation to interactions with suppliers
(Cromie & Birley, 1993).
Empirical research shows that entrepreneurs tend to have
stronger social networks than other people. For instance, Aldrich,
Rosen, and Woodward (1987) found that people who have more
contact with other members of their social networks are more
likely to start businesses. Denison, Swaminathan, and Rothbard
(1994) found that the size of a person’s social network had a
positive effect on their probability of starting a business. Shane
and Cable (2002) and Shane and Stuart (2002) found that the presence of social ties between entrepreneurs and investors increased
the odds that the entrepreneurs would raise money from the
investors.
Fourth, the desire for autonomy and the preference for job security affect the tendency to be an entrepreneur. People high in need
for autonomy have a disproportionate tendency to start businesses
because they want to set their own rules and hours, pick their own
goals and plans, and make their own decisions (Rauch & Frese,
2007a, 2007b).
Empirical studies show that entrepreneurs are higher in the desire for autonomy and lower in preference for job security than
other people (Caird, 1991; Cromie & O’Donaghue, 1992; Hornaday
& Aboud, 1973). In fact, one study showed that agreement with the
statement: ‘‘being my own boss is vital in choosing a job” increases
the odds that a person will be self-employed ten years later, while
agreement with the statement: ‘‘job security is most vital in choosing a job” reduces the odds that a person will be self-employed a
decade hence (Burke, FitzRoy, & Nolan, 2000). Moreover, Vesalainen and Pihkala (1999) found that the desire for independence increases the odds that a person will engage in the business start-up
process. And Reynolds and White (1997) found that people engaged in the start-up process scored higher on measures of autonomy and independence than a control group representing the
overall population.

In short, we argue that the same genetically-inﬂuenced factors
increase the probability that people will both recognize opportunities and be entrepreneurs. Therefore, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2. The same genetic factors account for part of the
covariation between opportunity recognition and the tendency to
be an entrepreneur.
Methodology
We use behavioral genetics techniques to examine the degree to
which opportunity recognition has a genetic component, and
whether the same genetic component accounts for variation across
people in both opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an
entrepreneur. Behavioral genetics involves the comparison of
monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins to disentangle the portion of the variance in opportunity recognition that comes from genetic and environmental factors as well as the portion of the
covariance between opportunity recognition and the tendency to
be an entrepreneur that is accounted for by genetic factors. MZ
twins are formed when a single sperm fertilizes a single egg; the
egg subsequently splits into two, resulting into two individuals
who are genetically identical (Kendler & Prescott, 2006). DZ twins
are formed when two different eggs are fertilized by two different
sperm, and hence share, on average, 50% of their segregating genes,
just like all other full siblings.
Because MZ twins share their entire genetic composition and
DZ twins share, on average, 50% of their segregating genes, studies
of twins can provide estimates in the heritability (or degree to
which the source of variation in a population is genetic) of a phenotype of interest (in this case, opportunity recognition). Assuming
that MZ and DZ co-twins do not differ in the similarity of their
environments, differences in the correlations between pairs of
MZ and DZ co-twins is a function of genetic factors.
We use bivariate genetics techniques to identify whether the
same genetic factors inﬂuence both opportunity recognition and
the tendency to be an entrepreneur. By comparing MZ and DZ
twin correlations across both opportunity recognition and the
tendency to be an entrepreneur, (e.g., we compare one twin’s
opportunity recognition score with its co-twin’s tendency to be
an entrepreneur score) we can determine the extent to which
the correlation between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur is a function of genetic factors. If
the cross-trait-cross-twin correlations are greater for MZ twins
than for DZ twins, then genetic factors contribute to the phenotypic correlation between these two variables, but if the crosstrait-cross-twin correlations are equal for MZ and DZ twins, or
are greater for DZ twins than for MZ twins, then genetic factors
do not contribute to the phenotypic correlation between these
two variables.
The validity of twin studies rests on the assumption that the
shared environment of DZ twins is similar to that of the MZ twins,
so called the equal environments assumption (EEA). For this
assumption to be violated environmental factors must treat MZ
twins in a different way than DZ twins and this difference in treatment must inﬂuence the phenotype under study. Different methods have been used to evaluate the EEA, all of which conﬁrm the
robustness of the assumption (Kendler & Prescott, 2006). First,
studies have compared the phenotypic similarity in twin pairs
using data on real and perceived zygosity, and have found that actual, and not perceived, twin zygosity is what inﬂuences twin similarity (Kendler & Prescott, 2006; Scarr, 1968; Scarr & CarterSaltzman, 1979). Second, studies that have used different methods
to assess the similarity of environmental exposure, such as (i) twin
ratings of similarity at childhood, adolescence and adulthood, (ii)
ratings of physical similarity from photographs, and (iii) ratings

111

of similarity of parental treatment, have failed to ﬁnd consistent
violations of the EEA (Hettema, Neale, & Kendler, 1995; Kendler,
Neale, Kessler, Heath, & Eaves, 1994; Kendler & Prescott, 2006).
The frequency of contact between MZ and DZ twins constitutes
another dimension of the equal environments assumption (EEA)
(Mitchell et al., 2007). If MZ twins interact more often than DZ
twins, greater similarity in their behavior might be accounted for
by frequency of contact rather than genetic factors. For this greater
contact between MZ than DZ twins to violate the EEA two conditions must hold. First, MZ co-twins must be in greater contact than
DZ co-twins. Second, and more importantly, the direction of causality must run from frequency of contact to twin similarity. If greater
contact between MZ twins cause greater MZ twin similarity, then
the equal environments assumption will be violated and heritability parameters will be overestimated. However, if greater MZ twin
similarity causes more MZ twin contact then the equal environments assumption remains valid and the heritability parameters
remain unaffected (Posner, Baker, Heath, & Martin, 1996). The evidence on this matter gathered by previous researchers suggests
that the direction of causality runs from similarity to contact rather
than the other way round (Lykken, McGue, Bouchard, & Tellegen,
1990; Posner et al., 1996), preserving the robustness of the equal
environments assumption.
Sample
Our sample consists of 3, 412 twins, comprising 851 pairs of MZ
and 855 pairs of DZ female twins from the United Kingdom who
were raised together. We ascertained twin zygosity through a standardized validated questionnaire – which has an accuracy of 95%
(Martin & Martin, 1975; Peeters, Gestel, Vlietinck, Derom, & Derom, 1998) – and, in cases of uncertainty, through multiplex DNA
ﬁngerprinting using variable tandem repeats – which has an accuracy of around 99.7% (Singer, MacGregor, Cherkas, & Spector,
2005).
The twins were initially recruited through a national media
campaign designed to gather data for medical research (Spector,
Cicuttini, Baker, Loughlin, & Hart, 1996; www.twinsuk.ac.uk). In
2006, each subject was sent a self-completion postal questionnaire,
which focused mostly on gathering information on medical conditions (e.g. osteoporosis, response to pain etc.), but which also gathered information relevant to the present study. Because the focus
of the data collection was on medical issues, the subjects were unaware of the hypotheses of this study when completing the questionnaire. The average age of the twins was 55 years (standard
deviation = 12.88).
Measure of opportunity recognition
We measure opportunity recognition through the use of a ﬁveitem scale composed of the following questions drawn from the literature on opportunity recognition (Baron & Ozgen, 2007; Singh
et al., 1999): (In all ﬁve opportunity recognition questions we used
a ﬁve point scale from one to ﬁve. In four of these questions the answer categories ranged from ‘‘strongly disagree” to ‘‘strongly
agree”. With the third question the answer categories were ‘‘none”,
‘‘one”, ‘‘two”, ‘‘three”, ‘‘four or more”, the respective answers were
coded from one to ﬁve.)

 I enjoy thinking about new ways of doing things.
 I frequently identify opportunities to start-up new businesses
(even though I may not pursue them).
 How many ideas for new businesses did you think of in the past
month?

Measures of the tendency to be an entrepreneur

Twin 1
The literature does not agree on a deﬁnition of entrepreneurship – the deﬁnitions used by researchers range from self-employment (Parker, 2004) to founding a new ﬁrm (Gartner, 1988) to
being an owner-operator of a company (Hull et al., 1982). Rather
than choose one deﬁnition over another, we sought to determine
whether these different deﬁnitions measure the same underlying
construct, and, if so, to create an overall measure of the tendency
to be an entrepreneur that is based on these different variables.
We asked the respondents about the following dimensions of
the tendency to be an entrepreneur:
 Self-employment, (Amit, Muller, & Cockburn, 1995; Burke et al.,
2000; Evans & Leighton, 1989; Parker, 2004; Taylor, 1996; Van
Praag & Cramer, 2001; Sorenson, 2007), which we operationalize
with the question: ‘‘in your working life, how long have you
been self-employed?”
 Starting a new business (Choi & Shepherd, 2004; Delmar &
Davidsson, 2000; Gartner, 1988), which we operationalize with
the question: ‘‘in your working life, how many new businesses
have you started?”
 Being an owner-operator of a company (Ahmed, 1985; Bitler,
Moskowitz, & Vissing-Jørgensen, 2005; Hull et al., 1982), which
we operationalize with the question: ‘‘in your working life, how
many companies have you been an owner-operator of?”
 Engaging in the ﬁrm start-up process (Choi & Shepherd, 2004;
Delmar & Shane, 2003; Reynolds, Carter, Gartner, & Greene,
2004; Ruef, Aldrich, & Carter, 2003), which we operationalize
with the question: ‘‘in your working life, for how many new
business ideas have you taken any actions toward the creation
of a new business?”
We factor analyzed the responses and found that they loaded on
the same factor. We then combined these different items into a
scale, which we found to be reliable, it had a Cronbach’s alpha of
0.79.2
Structural equation modeling
The relative contribution of genetic and environmental variation to opportunity recognition can be estimate quantitatively by
using variance components analysis. In the basic twin design, variation can arise from three sources: additive genetic effects (A),
shared (or common) environmental effects (C) (i.e. factors shared
by family members), and non-shared environmental factors (E)
(i.e., environmental effects that are unique to an individual) (Kendler & Prescott, 2006).
Diagrammatically the model that we estimate is shown in Fig. 1.
The boxes represent the observed variables (i.e. opportunity recognition or the tendency to be an entrepreneur), while the circles

A factor analysis with Varimax rotation of the four tendency to be an
entrepreneur and the ﬁve opportunity recognition questions yielded two distinct
factors with eigenvalues were 3.52 and 1.67 respectively. The KMO measure of
sampling adequacy was 0.82 and Bartlett’s test of Sphericity was highly signiﬁcant
(p = .0001; v2 = 4316; 36 df). There were no cross factor loadings and all loadings
were higher than 0.50.

represent the latent factors that the model estimates (i.e., additive
genetic (A), common environmental (C) and non-shared environmental factors (E)). The correlation between the latent additive genetic factors is constrained at 1.00 for MZ and at 0.5 for DZ twins to
reﬂect the degree of genetic relatedness. Because both MZ and DZ
twin pairs were raised together, and so shared the same common
environment, the correlation between latent common environmental factors is constrained at 1.00 for both types of twins. The
non-shared environmental components are assumed to be uncorrelated across members of a twin pair.
The contributions of A, C, and E to the total variance are evaluated through a series of nested sub-model comparisons using the
MX model ﬁtting software. The ﬁt of each model is estimated using
a chi-square goodness of ﬁt test, with a perfect ﬁt denoted by 1.00.
A non-signiﬁcant chi-square indicates a good model ﬁt. We used
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1987) and the Root
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) to select the best ﬁtting model (Neale & Maes, 2002). (Lower values of the AIC and the
RMSEA indicate a better model ﬁt.)
Bivariate genetic analysis
The degree to which the same genetic factors affect both opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur is measured through bivariate genetic analysis (the path diagram is
illustrated in Fig. 2). Bivariate genetic analysis allows the covariance between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an
entrepreneur to be partitioned into that due to additive genetic,
shared environmental, and non-shared environmental effects
(Kuntsi et al., 2004; Rice, van den Bree, & Thapar, 2004; Singer
et al., 2005). In such analysis, MZ and DZ twin correlations are
compared across variables. In our case, one twin’s score on opportunity recognition is correlated with the co-twin’s score on the tendency to be an entrepreneur. If the cross-trait cross-twin
correlations are greater for MZ twins than for DZ twins, this means
that genetic factors contribute to the phenotypic correlation between the two variables. The bivariate model is based on a Cholesky parameterization (Kuntsi et al., 2004; Loehlin, 1996).
In this ﬁgure rA, rC, and rE represent the genetic correlation, the
shared environmental correlation and the unique environmental
correlation, respectively. The genetic correlation, rA, indicates the
extent to which the genetic inﬂuences on recognition overlap with
those on the tendency to be an entrepreneur, irrespective of their
individual heritabilities (Kuntsi et al., 2004). A genetic correlation
of 1 would mean that all genetic inﬂuences on opportunity recognition also impact the tendency to be an entrepreneur (Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, & McGufﬁn, 2001).

Table 3 shows the results of model ﬁtting for opportunity recognition. The chi-square test for goodness of ﬁt for the model, the
Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1987) and the Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) showed that the best ﬁtting model for opportunity recognition included additive genetic
and non-shared environmental factors (AE model). The heritability
of the opportunity recognition scale was 0.45 (p = .21; AIC = 2.20;
RMSEA = 0.03) [95% CI 0.39–0.50%]. None of the variance could be
attributed to shared environmental factors.
Table 4 shows the results of model ﬁtting to the tendency to be
an entrepreneur. The AE was the best ﬁtting model, with 30% of the
variance in tendency to be an entrepreneur explained by genetic
factors (p = .53; AIC = 4.85; RMSEA = .01) [95% CI 0.24–0.36%].
Moreover, the genetic effect was not an artefact of the scale used
to measure the tendency to be an entrepreneur. The AE was the
best ﬁtting model for each of the measures of entrepreneurship
alone, with 40% of the variance in the ‘‘start a new business” measure explained by genetic factors (p = .10; AIC = 0.07;
RMSEA = 0.02) [95% CI 0.29–0.51%]; 39% of the variance in the
‘‘self-employment” measure (p = .81; AIC = 6.40; RMSEA = 0.001)
[95% CI 0.28–0.49%]; 43% of the variance in the ‘‘engage in the ﬁrm
start-up process” measure (p = .67; AIC = 5.66; RMSEA = 0.001)
[95% CI 0.33–0.53%]; 30% of the variance in the ‘‘owner-operator
of a company” measure (p = .96; AIC = 7.39; RMSEA = 0.001)
[95% CI 0.17–0.43%]; and 31% of the variance in an ‘‘opportunity
exploitation” scale (Choi & Shepherd, 2004) composed of the
‘‘starting a new business” and ‘‘engaging in the ﬁrm start-up process” measures (p = .54; AIC = 4.88; RMSEA = 0.001) [95% CI
0.25–0.37%].

None of the variance in the tendency to be an entrepreneur
could be attributed to shared environmental factors.
The underlined values in Table 2 show the cross-twin-crosstrait correlations for each variable. The cross-trait cross-twin correlations for MZ twins were 0.16 and 0.24. Similarly, the cross-trait
cross-twin correlations for DZ twins were 0.10 and 0.08. The
cross-trait cross-twin correlations are greater for MZ twins than
for DZ twins suggesting that genetic factors are contributing to
the phenotypic correlation between opportunity recognition and
the tendency to be an entrepreneur. In fact, the bivariate genetic
analysis indicates that 53%3 of the phenotypic correlation between
the tendency to be an entrepreneur and opportunity recognition is
accounted for by genetic inﬂuences that are common to the two
(see Table 5).
As a robustness check we also calculated bivariate models using
the speciﬁc items that compose the entrepreneurship scale – selfemployment, starting a business, engaged in the ﬁrm start-up process, and being an owner-operator of a company – to ensure that
the results reported in Table 5 are not an artefact of scale construction. The proportion of the phenotypic correlation accounted for by
genetic factors is similar for the speciﬁc items composing the
entrepreneurship scale and the overall scale, indicating that the
ﬁndings described in Table 5 are not an artefact.

Discussion
We applied quantitative genetics techniques to a female sample
of 851 pairs of MZ twins and 855 pairs of DZ twins to examine the
magnitude of the genetic component of opportunity recognition
and the extent to which the same genetic factors explain both
opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur.

Table 5 shows that the genetic correlation (rA) is 0.51. Multiplying the genetic
correlation by the square root of the univariate heritability estimates for recognition
and exploitation yields the amount of the correlation between recognition and

exploitation that is explained by genetic factors, i.e. 0.51  0.45  0.30 = 0.187.
This means that 53% of the phenotypic correlation between exploitation and
recognition (which is 0.35) is accounted for by genetic inﬂuences that are common
to exploitation and recognition (0.187/0.35 = 0.53).

% of phenotypic r attributable to genetic inﬂuence (95% CI)

The results showed substantial heritability for opportunity recognition (0.45), with no inﬂuence of the shared environment. We
found that 53% of the phenotypic correlation between opportunity
recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur had a common
genetic aetiology.

Limitations
Like all studies, this one is not without limitations. Our study’s
validity depends on support for the equal environments assumption. This assumption holds that MZ twins are not treated more
similarly than DZ twins with respect to the phenotype under study,
and, in our case would be violated if the family or non-family environment treated MZ twins more similarly than DZ twins with respect to opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an
entrepreneur. For example, if loan ofﬁcers were more likely to offer
the same loan terms to pairs of MZ twins than to pairs of DZ twins,
the equal environments assumption would be violated. Alternatively, if other people provide MZ twins with more similar information about entrepreneurial opportunities than they provide DZ
twins, the equal environments assumption would be violated.
However, we have no way of verifying the validity of the
assumption for either opportunity recognition or the tendency to
be an entrepreneur. While we know of no evidence, anecdotal or
statistical, which suggests that the environment treats MZ twins
more similarly than DZ twins with respect to opportunity recognition or the tendency to be an entrepreneur and therefore believe
that the assumption holds, we acknowledge that our inability to
‘‘show” support for the assumption is a limitation of the paper.
Our results also have limited generalizability. Because our sample was initially recruited to study medical conditions that occur
primarily in women, the sample is entirely female, limiting our
ability to generalize to men. In fact, researchers have reason to believe that the effect of genetic factors on entrepreneurial behavior
is gender-speciﬁc. Therefore, we cannot assume that the same patterns we found in this study exist for men.
Our results are only a ﬁrst step toward explaining how our
genes inﬂuence entrepreneurial behavior. Behavioral genetics

<-----Page 7----->N. Nicolaou et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 108–117

studies, such as this one, cannot identify the speciﬁc genes that affect the likelihood of opportunity recognition and the tendency to
be an entrepreneur. Therefore, we know that some of the same
genes affect both aspects of entrepreneurial behavior, given the
relatively high genetic correlation between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur. However, we must
await future research to identify what those genes are; how many
are at work; how they interact; and the mechanisms through
which they operate.

Implications
Despite the limitations just mentioned, the results of our study
have implications for both research on, and the practice of, entrepreneurship. On the research side, our study contributes to an
emerging stream of research that integrates biological and sociological explanations for entrepreneurial activity (White, Thornhill,
& Hampson, 2006; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, & Spector,
2008). While this school of thought does not negate the importance of environmental factors in explaining entrepreneurship, it
suggests that we need to consider also the inﬂuence of biological
factors if we are to develop accurate explanations for this important phenomenon.
Our study suggests the value of considering the role of genetics
in the opportunity recognition process, particularly when examining female entrepreneurs and prospective entrepreneurs. To date,
research has explained only a small part of the variance between
people in the recognition of new business opportunities (Ardichvili
et al., 2003; Baron & Ensley, 2006; Gaglio & Katz, 2001; Shane,
2000; Singh et al., 1999; Baron & Ozgen, 2007). Moreover, much
of the research has only identiﬁed proximal factors that are correlated with opportunity recognition, not the underlying mechanisms through which this process works. Whether the underlying
mechanisms that account for these correlations involve learning
or genetics (we believe that they are most likely a combination
of both), has important ramiﬁcations for how we think about the
answers to the questions of ‘‘why” and ‘‘how” people identify
new business opportunities. Our results indicate that researchers
should view opportunity recognition as an activity for which our
genetic make-up plays a role in explaining the variance across people in this activity. While future empirical work corroborating our
ﬁndings would be necessary before ﬁrmly drawing any conclusions, this pattern suggests a different way of thinking about
why and how people recognize entrepreneurial opportunities.
It is important to stress that our results do not imply that
opportunity recognition is genetically determined, but only that
genetic factors inﬂuence the propensity to recognize opportunities.
In fact, our results show that a substantial part of opportunity recognition is accounted for by non-shared environmental factors
(plus measurement error). Nevertheless, our ﬁnding that the variance across people in opportunity recognition is a function of both
genetic and environmental factors suggests that the implicit ‘‘all
environmental” approach in the literature is incomplete.
The inﬂuence of genetic factors on opportunity recognition also
implies that the use of non-experimental data to investigate the
impact of environmental factors can lead to confounded estimates
because unobserved genetic endowments simultaneously inﬂuence both the environmental factors correlated with opportunity
recognition and opportunity recognition itself (Kohler, Behrman,
& Skytthe, 2005). Therefore, our results indicate that scholars need
to use ﬁxed-effects models within MZ twins (co-twin control designs) to overcome the estimation problems caused by the effects
of genetic factors on the environmental factors themselves (Kohler
et al., 2005). Such approaches will enable entrepreneurship
researchers to conduct more rigorous empirical analyses of the

115

relationship between environmental variables and the likelihood
of recognizing entrepreneurial opportunities.
Our ﬁnding that the ‘‘shared environment” did not inﬂuence
opportunity recognition was quite surprising. Nevertheless, this
is consistent with research in other areas of quantitative genetics
that found no inﬂuence of the shared environment in many aspects
of human behavior (e.g. Kendler & Prescott, 2006; Plomin et al.,
2001; Singer et al., 2006). For example, personality characteristics
and psychopathology also show zero shared environmental inﬂuences (Kendler & Prescott, 2006; Loehlin, 1992; Plomin, DeFries,
McClearn, & McGufﬁn, 2008). Our ﬁnding of no effect of the shared
environment implies that ‘‘shared environmental” inﬂuences such
as a person’s upbringing are not important in opportunity
recognition.4
Our ﬁnding of a common genetic factor for both opportunity
recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur indicates that
these two activities are fundamentally linked. However, we do not
argue that genetic factors cause opportunity recognition to increase, which, in turn, causes people to become entrepreneurs.
Opportunity recognition might increase the likelihood that a person becomes an entrepreneur, but being an entrepreneur may also
make people more alert to entrepreneurial opportunities. Our results merely show that the same genetic factors inﬂuence the tendency to both recognize opportunities and be an entrepreneur and
would be consistent with either or both directions of causality between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an
entrepreneur.
Nevertheless, the bivariate genetic association that we found
between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur has implications for molecular genetics research. It implies
that if speciﬁc genes were found to account for some of the variance in opportunity recognition, these same genes would be good
candidates to consider for explaining some of the variance in the
tendency to be an entrepreneur. However, half of the genetic variance in the tendency to be an entrepreneur is not shared with recognition, suggesting that independent genetic effects on the
tendency to be an entrepreneur exist as well.
Finally, our study has implications for research on gender differences in entrepreneurship. Many researchers have argued that
explanations for why and how people become entrepreneurs
should be gender-speciﬁc (Shane, 2003). Recent research shows
that genetic factors may play a larger role in explaining whether
or not women become entrepreneurs than they do in explaining
whether or not men do. Our results support this stream of research,
showing that the same genetic factors that inﬂuence the tendency
of women to become entrepreneurs also play a large role in opportunity recognition by women.
Our ﬁndings also have implications for research on organizations in general. Researchers interested in organizations and orga4
It is important to clarify what this ﬁnding actually means. It means that each child
has a unique and speciﬁc upbringing, and this is modelled through the ‘‘non-shared
environmental factor” (Arvey Rotundo, Johnson, Zhang, & McGue, 2006). It also
‘‘implies that sharing a family environment does not contribute importantly to family
resemblance. It does not mean that the. . .family environment is unimportant (Plomin
et al., 2008, p. 73; emphasis added)” or that families and peers do not inﬂuence the
likelihood of engaging in entrepreneurship. Rather, ‘‘if these factors are important,
they are not affecting the two members of a twin pair in the same way” (Kendler &
Prescott, 2006, p. 345). As Kendler and Prescott (2006, p. 344) explain, ‘‘In twin
studies we detect the effects of family environment only if they effectively inﬂuence
both twins to a similar degree. If parents are abusive to one twin in a way that has a
strong impact on later risk for psychopathology but are not abusive to the other twin,
it might seem logical that this effect – which certainly occurs within the family –
would be identiﬁed in a twin analysis as part of the ‘‘family environment”. But it will
not be. Instead, it will appear as an individual-speciﬁc effect because it affects only
one member of the twin pair. Alternatively, the twins might be exposed to the same
adversity but, because of prior differences in experience. . ., one twin may be more
vulnerable to its pathogenic effects than the other. Again, in a twin design this will
appear as an individual-speciﬁc, not a shared environmental effect.”

nizational behavior cannot simply assume the existence of those
organizations, but also need to understand their creation. Because
new organizations are created by entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs
decisions are affected by their psychological processes, any research which provides insight into how the psychological processes of entrepreneurs affect their decision making should be of
interest to organization scholars.
One of the most fundamental questions about human decision
making and the psychological processes underlying it is whether
the driving forces behind these activities is nature or nurture.
Our study examines the extent to which the psychological processes and human decision making that underlies entrepreneurial
efforts to create organizations is partly innate. Our ﬁndings that
opportunity recognition is partially genetic and that the same genetic factors inﬂuence both opportunity recognition and the decision to be an entrepreneur provides important insight into the
source of factors affecting the creation of new organizations, which
is necessary for the development of accurate theories of
organization.
Our study also has important implications for business practice.
Our ﬁnding that the entire environmental inﬂuence on opportunity
recognition was accounted for by unique environmental factors
should hearten managers and policy makers. Given that a signiﬁcant component of the unique environment comes from a person’s
work environment, our results suggest that companies and policy
makers can inﬂuence the likelihood that people will recognize
entrepreneurial opportunities. Thus, efforts to ﬁnd the right environmental inﬂuences to enhance opportunity recognition – be
those training, working conditions, or incentives – may prove to
be quite fruitful.
However, our ﬁnding that 53% of the phenotypic correlation between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur is accounted for by the same genetic factor indicates that our
ability to encourage entrepreneurial activity through interventions
designed to inﬂuence their ability to recognize new business
opportunities is smaller than many observers currently believe.
From a practical point of view, this constraint suggests a relatively
smaller role for interventions to enhance opportunity recognition
as a way to inﬂuence the level of entrepreneurship that occurs.
