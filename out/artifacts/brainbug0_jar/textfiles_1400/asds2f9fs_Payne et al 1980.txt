TRANSLATION OF GAMBLES AND ASPIRATION LEVEL
EFFECTS IN RISKY CHOICE BEHAVIOR*
JOHN W. PAYNE, t DAN J. LAUGHHUNNt AND ROY CRUM$
Two recent models of risky decision making developed by Fishburn [6] and by Kahneman
and Tversky [11] have emphasized the importance of a target return or a reference point in
determining preferences and choices among gambles. Target returns and reference points
represent variations on the concept of an aspiration level, an old idea in theories of decision
making. Additional evidence on the need to incorporate such a concept in the analysis of risky
choice behavior is presented in this paper. In three experiments, the relationship of pairs of
gambles to an assumed reference point was varied by adding or subtracting a constant amount
from all outcomes. The results demonstrate that such translations of outcomes can result in
the reversal of choice within pairs of gambles. The effect of such translations on choice
depended on whether the size of the translation was sufficient to insure that one gamble in a
pair had outcome values either all above or all below the reference point, while the other
gamble had outcome values both above and below the reference point. A model of the effects
of a reference point on risky choice behavior is presented and the results are also discussed in
terms of the Fishburn and Kahneman-Tversky models, as well as other theories of risky
decision making.
(DECISION MAKING; ASPIRATION LEVEL; UTILITY PREFERENCE)

1. Introduction
The general concept of an aspiration level is an old idea in theories of decision
making [25], [26]. Simon [26], for example, suggested that one way individuals simplify
choice problems is to code an outcome as being one of two types: satisfactory if the
outcome is above the aspiration level or unsatisfactory if it is below.' The significance
of the aspiration level concept has been reemphasized recently in two models of risky
decision making developed by Fishburn [6] and Kahneman and Tversky [11]. In the
Fishburn model, the risk of a gamble is associated with outcomes below a target
return, while in the Kahneman-Tversky model outcomes are coded into gains and
losses depending upon whether they are above or below a reference point. The
concepts of target return and reference point used in these two models are special cases
of an aspiration level, appropriately defined for alternatives with monetary consequences. For purposes of discussion in this paper, all three terms-target return,
reference point, and aspiration level-are used interchangeably since all will refer to
the pre- determined benchmark return used by a decision maker to translate monetary
outcomes into gains and losses.
The purpose of the present paper is to provide additional empirical evidence on the
need to incorporate a target return, reference point, or aspiration level concept in the

analysis of risky choice behavior. The paper is organized as follows. First, the Fishburn
and Kahneman-Tversky models are briefly discussed, along with results from previous
surveys of managerial practice which have identified the importance of an aspiration
level in the decision-making process of business executives. Next, the design of the
empirical study of aspiration level effects is discussed and related to the Fishburn and
Kahneman-Tversky models. Results from three different experiments, one of which
involved high-level managers as subjects, are then presented and the relationship of
these results to several other models of decision-making under conditions of risk are
discussed. A set of propositions that serve to summarize the empirical results, along
with ideas contained in the literature, are then presented in order to highlight the
impact of an aspiration level on risky choice behavior. The paper concludes with a
brief discussion of the implications of the empirical evidence for model building in
management science.
2. The Fishburnand Kahneman-Tversky Models
The Fishburn model, denoted the a - t model, uses the concept of a target level of
return to define the risk of an alternative. Formally, the risk of an alternative, denoted
A, is measured as the following probability weighted function of returns below a
target:
R(A)

=

(t

- X)a

dF(X),

where F(x) is the probability of receiving a return not exceeding x, t is the target
return, and a is a nonnegative parameter used to measure the relative importance of
the size of the deviations below target and the probability of failing to reach the target.
Both a and t are parameters that are unique to a decision maker. Fishburn argues that
if the main concern of a decision maker is failure to achieve the target, without
particular regard to the size of the deviation, then a value of a in the range 0 < a < 1
is appropriate. For this range of a values, Fishburn demonstrates that the underlying
utility function for the decision maker is convex for losses (consistent with risk
seeking). On the other hand, Fishburn argues that a value of a in the range a > 1
implies that the descision maker regards small deviations below target as being
relatively harmless when compared to large deviations. In this case, Fishburn shows
that the decision maker has a utility function which is concave for losses (consistent
with risk aversion).
In the a - t model, the risk of an alternative is combined with its mean return to
determine preference. Given any two alternatives A and B, having mean returns A(A)
and A(B) respectively, A is preferred to B if and only if: A(A) > A(B) and R(A)
< R (B) with at least one strict inequality holding.: The general form of the a - t
model is a familiar one since it has the characteristics of a mean-risk dominance
model. The important point for the present paper is the central role that the target
level of return assumes in defining risk for the Fishburn model.
The Kahneman-Tversky model, called prospect theory, is proposed as an alternative to expected utility theory in its traditional form. Prospect theory views risky
decision making as a two-phase process. The first phase involves editing the given
decision problem into a simpler representation in order to make the evaluation of
gambles and choice easier for the decision maker. The second phase involves assigning

<-----Page 3----->ASPIRATION LEVELS IN RISKY CHOICE

1041

an overall value to each edited gamble and the subsequent choice of the gamble with
the greatest value. An important feature of prospect theory is the critical role that is
attributed to an aspiration level in the analysis of risky decisions. A key operation in
the editing phase is the coding by the decision maker of each of the outcomes of a
gamble as being either a gain or a loss, with a gain or loss defined by the relationship
of the outcome to a reference point or level of aspiration.2 According to Kahneman
and Tversky, a decision maker then responds to a gamble, in part, by assigning
subjective values to the associated gains and losses. The value function, which is the
Kahneman-Tversky version of a utility function, is assumed to be concave for gains,
convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for equivalent gains.3 Kahneman and
Tversky point out that a consequence of their theory is that a change in the reference
point may change the preference ordering among a set of gambles.
Kahneman and Tversky support their assumption that the value function is concave
for gains and convex for losses, and hence support the need for a reference point, by
showing that the preference ordering between gambles involving negative amounts of
money is often the mirror image (reverse) of the preference ordering between gambles
involving positive amounts of money. For example, [11, p. 268], the gamble which
provides a chance to win $3000 with probability 0.9 or to win nothing with probability
0.1, denoted ($3000, 0.9), is usually chosen over the gamble ($6000, 0.45), a result which
implies a concave value function. On the other hand, when these two gambles are
reversed, the gamble (- $ 6000,0.45) is usually chosen over the gamble (- $3000, 0.9),
a result which implies a convex value function. Kahneman and Tversky refer to this
pattern of choices as the reflection effect.4
Additional evidence supporting a reference point or target level concept can be
found in surveys of management practice. For example, Mao [16] asked executives in
eight medium and large companies about the capital budgeting practices of their firms.
One question concerned what the executives understood by the term "investment risk."
A sample response one executive provided was [16, p. 343]:
"Risk is the prospect of not meeting the target rate of return. That is the risk, isn't it? If you
are one hundred percent sure of making the target return, then it is a zero risk proposition."

A more recent, and more complete, survey of capital budgeting practices by Petty and
Scott [22] also shows that the idea of a target return is widely used by managers. They
sent a questionnaire to the chief financial officer of each firm listed in the May 1977
director of Fortune 500 firms and had a response rate of 35.3 percent. Respondents
were asked to define a "risky investment." The most common response was the
probability of not achieving a target rate of return. Conrath [2], Libby and Fishburn
[15] and Crum, Laughhunn and Payne [5] cite additional evidence on the use of a
target or aspiration level concept in business decision making.
2This view of outcomes as being gains or losses is an alternative to the view of assessing outcomes in terms
of final asset position, as is the case in most expected utility analyses.
3Empirical support for the assumption that the value function is steeper for losses than for equivalent
gains can be found in Fishburn and Kochenberger [7].
4Hershey and Schoemaker [9] have raised some questions about the the strength of the evidence presented
by Kahneman and Tversky on the reflection effect. They note that the data presented by Kahneman and
Tversky does not make clear how much individual reflectivity occurred, i.e., within subjects. They also
present some data of their own tha-tis mixed with respect to the reflection effect. Additional research seems
warranted.

Design of the Study

An experimental investigation of aspiration level effects on risky choice behavior
can proceed in several ways. One procedure would be to try to change the aspiration
level held by an individual through explicit instructions. For example, a decision
maker might be told that he or she will be presented with a set of risky options to
select from and that the target level of return on a project for his or her company is
18%. Another procedure would be to accept that there are individual differences in
terms of aspiration levels, try to measure those differences independently, and then to
determine if a correlation exists between the individual difference measures and
different individual patterns of choice over a set of risky alternatives. This has been a
popular approach of researchers working in the area of achievement motivation and
selection of performance tasks, e.g., Atkinson and Raynor [1].
This study used a third procedure, based on a translation of -outcomes, that is
suggested by Kahneman and Tversky [11, p. 287]. In this procedure the relationship
between a set of risky alternatives and an aspiration level was manipulated through
simple additive transformations of the alternatives. Consider the two three-outcome
gambles shown in Figure 1. Gamble GI, denoted (a, p; b, q; c, l-p-q), yields an
outcome of value a with probability p, outcome b with probability q, and outcome c
with probability l-p-q. The outcomes are ordered such that a > b > c. Gamble GII,
denoted (x, r; y, s; z, 1-r-s), is similar in interpretation. Note that a > x, b = y, and
c < z. If we let b = y = $0 then the two gambles represent "regular" prospects as
defined by Kahneman and Tversky [11]. In addition, if we assume that for most
decision makers a natural reference point is 0 (or t3) in Figure 1, then GI and GII each
have one outcome above the level of aspiration and one below. The assumption that
the point of no gain and no loss, i.e., the status quo, serves as the aspiration level is
often made [7], [11]. It is recognized, however, that the reference point may be above
the status quo return or below it [7]. The probabilities associated with the outcomes of
GI and GII are assumed to be different, but are specified so that the expected value of
GI equals the expected value of GII. The condition of equal expected values was not
necessary for the study, but was used to facilitate a subsequent comparison of
experimental results with several theories of decision making.
The relationships between GI and GII and the assumed target t3 = 0 can be
changed by the addition or subtraction of a constant k from all outcomes of GI and
GII. Consider first a positive translation (addition of k) where k > Izi but k < Icl.
Under this translation of both gambles, GI would still have one outcome below t3,

<-----Page 5----->ASPIRATION LEVELS IN RISKY CHOICE

while GII would have all outcomes above t3. Another way of viewing the effect of this
translation is that the level of aspiration is now at t2 in Figure 1.
Fishburn's model predicts that the translated gamble GII would be chosen over the
translated gamble GI since both gambles continue to have equal expected values,
whereas GII becomes riskless and GI remains risky for all values of a.
The predicted choice between the translated version of GI and GII based on the
Kahneman-Tversky model is not unambiguous for all decision makers since the
overall value of each gamble depends upon the specific characteristics of the value
function both above and below t3, as well as the specific values of the translated
outcomes and their probabilities. But the Kahneman-Tversky model does suggest the
choice of GII over GI after the translation. Choice of GII over GI by a decision maker
tends to occur because of the relative steepness of the value function for losses as
compared to equivalent gains. A large negative value assigned to the outcome for GI
that remains below t3 after the translation can cause the overall value of GI to decline
below GII.5 Another characteristic of the Kahneman-Tversky model that favors a
choice of GII over GI after the positive translation is the fact that GII now provides a
return above t3 with certainty. In this case, GII can be decomposed into a certain
return and an incremental gamble. The Kahneman-Tversky model allows for the
overweighting of the certain return component of GII, thereby also favoring a choice
of GII over GI.
Now consider the effect of a negative translation of the outcomes for GI and GII by
an amount - k where k is positive and k > x but k < a. After this translation of both
gambles, GI would still have one outcome above the target t3, while GII would now
have all outcomes below the target. Another way of viewing the effect of this negative
translation is that the target level has been raised to t4 in Figure 1.
The predicted choice of GI or GII based on Fishburn's model is not as definite
under such a negative translation, since preferences depend upon the decision maker's
risk attitude as measured by a and the characteristics of the translated gambles. To the
extent, however, that a decision maker is concerned primarily with the failure to
achieve the target level of return, consistent with a < 1 and risk seeking for losses, then
the choice of GI over GII is more likely. Estimates of a obtained from business
managers by Crum, et al. [5], using a procedure based on the Fishburn model, support
the assumption that a large majority of individuals have a values less that 1. Such
individuals would exhibit a strong tendency to choose GI after the negative translation.
The Kahneman-Tversky model also does not make a definite prediction for the
choice of either GI or GII, after the negative translation, that would hold for all
decision makers. The overall value of GI and GII to any decision maker, and hence
the gamble chosen, depends upon the specific characteristics of the value function, as
well as the properties of the translated gambles. But given the general properties of the
value function specified in their model, it is likely that a decision maker would choose
GI. Choice of GI, which continues to have an outcome above t3 after the negative
translation, is likely because GII now has all outcomes below the target, the region
where a high degree of relative steepness occurs and where negative values are
assigned by the value function. A further aspect of the translated gambles favoring the
5This statement presumes that the value function, denoted v(x), is indexed so that v(t3) = 0. In this case,
v(x) < 0 for x < t3 where x denotes return.

<-----Page 6----->1044

JOHN W. PAYNE, DAN J. LAUGHHUNN AND ROY CRUM

choice of GI is the fact that GII is now guaranteed to yield a return less than the target
and can therefore be decomposed into a certain loss and an incremental gamble
involving additional losses. The tendency of a decision maker to overweight certainty
would, in this instance, lead to an overweighting of the certain loss that also has a large
negative value to the decision maker. This would further reduce the overall value of
GII relative to GI and favor the choice of GI.
For both the Fishburn and Kahneman-Tversky models, the implication is that a
simple translation of outcomes by positive and negative amounts can result in a
reversal of choice between GI and GII. The predominant pattern of choices is
predicted to be a choice of GI under a negative translation (-k) and for a reversal of
choice to GII under a positive translation (k).
It should be noted that the translations to be used in this study have been the
subject of previous theoretical discussions of decision making under risk [10], [13], [14],
[23]. In particular, Pfanzagl [23] has stated the principle that the relationship between a
gamble and its certainty equivalent is invariant under the transformation that adds a
constant to all gamble outcomes and to the certainty equivalent. Pfanzagl argues that
this consistency principle has been tacitly assumed in many early treatments of
expected utility theory. More recently, Holloway [10] suggests that the consistency
principle is reasonable over ranges of outcomes and provides a simplification in the
analysis of portfolios of gambles. It has also been argued that the interpretation of
utility functions derived from empirical data is problematic if the consistency principle
does not hold [14].
Analysis of the Fishburn and Kahneman-Tversky models presented earlier, however, suggests that the consistency principle will be violated to the extent that reversals
in choices occur whenever a translation involves crossing a level of aspiration. The
following experiments examine the hypothesis that the choice from a pair of gambles
will reverse as a function of such a translation of outcomes.

Experimental Results

Experiment 1
Method. The subjects were 30 undergraduate or graduate students at Duke University. The subjects were either paid at a fixed hourly rate for their participation in the
experiment or were given credit toward a course requirement. The subjects were naive
with respect to the task and stimuli.
The stimuli were pairs of three-outcome gambles (see Table 1). Two initial sets of
four "regular" gambles were constructed. The values of the probabilities associated
with the gain and loss amounts were selected to range from 0.2 to 0.5 since this range
is likely to be well-behaved and well understood by subjects [11], [12]. The values of
the gain and loss amounts were selected to be in the range $8 to $86. Each gamble in
the initial sets was constructed to have an expected value of $0.
Four additional sets of gambles were then constructed by positive and negative
translations of all outcomes for the initial gambles. The first set of four gambles was
translated by an an amount of $30 and by an amount of - $30. The second set of
gambles was translated by an amount of $26 and by an amount of - $26. Pairs (A, B),
(A, Y), (X, B) and (X, Y) are those in which one would expect to observe a shift in
choice as a function of the translations.
Each subject was run individually. The subjects were told that they would be
presented with pairs of gambles to choose from and that they should indicate which

gamble in a pair they would prefer to play if they had to play one. They were also told
to consider each pair of gambles independently. No time constraints were placed on
subjects. Ten of the subjects were asked to give verbal protocols.
Each subject was presented with 36 pairs of gambles. The 36 pairs consisted of each
gamble in a given set of four gambles paired with every other gamble in that set. In
addition, there were four practice pairs presented at the beginning of each session. The
stimuli were presented to each subject on the screen of a computer terminal (PerkinElmer, 1200), connected on-line to an HP-2000 computer. The presentation of pairs
was in a different random order for each subject. Right-left positions of the gambles
within a pair were counterbalanced across subjects and pairs.
Results. The gamble in each of the initial pairs in gamble sets 1 and 2 (see Table 1)
that had the largest probability of winning was defined as GI. The other gamble was
denoted GII. Table 2 presents the proportion of subjects choosing the first gamble in
each of the 36 pairs of gambles.

It is clear from the proportions in Table 2 that positive and negative translations of
the set of gambles led to reversals in choices. Aggregating across gamble sets 1 and 2,
the mean proportion of choices of GI for the pairs of gambles (A, B), (A, Y), (X, B),
and (X, Y) under a positive translation was 0.23. These pairs all involve GI with two
outcomes above and one below the target and GII with all outcomes above the target.
The choices were strongly in the direction of GII. On the other hand, when aggregated
across both sets, the mean proportion of choices of GI for the same pairs of gambles
under a negative translation was 0.67. A more direct test of the hypothesis that choice
within a pair of gambles shifted as a function of the translations is provided by
counting the number of times the same gamble in a pair (either GI & GI or GII &
GII) was chosen under a positive and negative translation and the number of times a
shift in choice occurred, i.e., from GI to GII or from GII to GI. Table 3 presents the
results of such a count across the 30 subjects and the eight critical pairs of gambles.
The most common pattern of choice involved the predicted reversal: from GII for a
positive translation to GI for a negative translation. A test of the equality of two
correlated proportions, applied to the two cells that involved shifts in choice, showed a
significant difference (X2(l) = 78.0, p < 0.01).
An analysis of the patterns of choice for each individual subject confirms this
reversal. Twenty-five of the 30 subjects chose GII a majority of the time under the
positive translation of pairs (A, B), (A, Y), (X, B) and (X, Y). Nineteen of the 30
subjects chose GI a majority of the time under a negative translation. Together, the
group and individual analyses confirm shifts in choice, as a function of the translations, in the direction predicted by the Fishburn and Kahneman-Tversky models.
However, note in Table 2 that there was little indication of a choice reversal under a
translation of outcomes for gamble pairs (A , X) and (B, Y). These pairs of gambles are
ones for which the translations used were not sufficient to result in one gamble in a
pair being moved totally above or totally below the assumed reference point of $0.
Two other interesting patterns of choice can also be observed in Table 2. First,
under the assumption that gamble B is less risky than gamble A and that gamble Y is
less risky than gamble X, in the regular forms of the gambles (for both sets 1 and 2),
then a negative translation of gambles yielded greater risk seeking behavior. Such
behavior is suggested by data presented in Williams [29] and predicted by Kahneman
and Tversky [11]. A positive translation, on the other hand, leads to greater risk
aversion. This is inconsistent with suggestions contained in Holloway [10] that the only
likely effects of adding a constant to all outcomes are either no change in attitude

toward risk or decreasing risk aversion. The rationale, according to Holloway, is that
"...

.

as the minimum payoff increases, an individual becomes less risk averse [10, p.

394]." Second, note that the aggregated choice proportions under the negative translations were generally less extreme than under the positive translations. This is consistent
with the less clear preference prediction of the Fishburn model in this situation.
Finally, a third of the subjects in this experiment were asked to give verbal
protocols. An examination of the patterns of choices for those 10 subjects as opposed
to the other 20 subjects indicated that both groups of subjects responded similarly. In
particular, the mean choice proportions of GI for the negative and positive translations
were 0.30 and 0.68, and 0.19 and 0.67, for the protocol and nonprotocol subjects
respectively.
Verbal Protocols. Verbal protocols can be used in a variety of ways in decision
research [21]. The present paper used protocols simply to confirm and extend the
interpretation of the choice data. Complete protocols for each of the ten subjects when
faced with the positive and negative translations of gamble pair A, B (sets 3 and 5 from
Table 1, respectively) are provided in the Appendix.6 The protocols are broken up into
short phrases corresponding to a naive assessment of a single task assertion or
reference by the subject.
The protocols clearly support the view that the subjects were sensitive to whether a
pair of gambles included one gamble with outcomes all above the target or one gamble
with outcomes all below the target. In particular, note that for most of the subjects an
early observation concerned whether a gamble in a pair offered an opportunity for
only a gain or only a loss. As examples, consider the following excerpts from these
protocols:
B1: In this case, gamble one has one negative outcome
B2: and gamble two has none; or
D1: Here I see I've got a 50% chance of winning choice two.
D2: No chance of winning choice one.
Finally, it should also be noted that even though subjects placed great importance on
the probability of receiving a gain or a loss, they were sensitive to the amounts to be
won or lost and did make tradeoff judgments. See, for example, the protocols for the
first two subjects. Overall, the protocols appear consistent with the choice data and the
interpretations of that data presented earlier.
Experiment 2
In the previous experiment, pairs of gambles were constructed so that the gamble in
a pair with the greater probability of winning (GI) generally had the greater variance.
The second experiment used similar pairs of gambles and also pairs of gambles where
the gamble in a pair with the greater probability of winning (GI) had the smaller
variance. In addition, the format used to present the gambles was changed. For
experiment 1, the gambles were presented in a matrix form on the screen of a
computer terminal. Experiment 2 presented the options using a pie-diagram format in
the manner described by Payne [19].
Method. The subjects were 42 paid undergraduates at Duke University. The
subjects were recruited to participate in two studies: one involved questions about

consumer behavior and the other involved a small number of risky choice questions.
Both studies took place in a group setting including up to eight subjects.
Six pairs of gambles were constructed (see Table 4). Problem 1 and its positive and
negative translations (problems 3 and 5) are similar to the pairs in experiment 1.
Problem 2 and its translations (problems 4 and 6) have a slightly different pattern of
relationships between the gambles in a pair, i.e., GI has a lower variance than GII.
These six pairs of gambles were presented to the subjects in a booklet that contained
a number of other choice problems. Each pair of gambles was on a separate page in
the booklet. The order of the pairs of gambles was randomized within a booklet and
across subjects. The position of a gamble on a page was counterbalanced across
subjects. Each subject was instructed to indicate, on a response scale located underneath each pair of gambles, the choice of gamble and strength of preference for the
chosen gamble. The response scale ran from A to H, divided at a point halfway
between D and E. The extremes of the scale (A and H) were marked "strong" and
scale positions adjacent to the center dividing line were marked "slight."

Number of subjects choosing the gamble listed above.

Results. The numbers of subjects choosing each gamble in each pair are given in
Table 4. The proportions of subjects choosing the gamble with all outcomes exceeding
the target for the positive translation in problems 3 and 4 were 0.86 and 0.90,
respectively. In contrast, under the negative translations in problems 5 and 6, the
proportions of subjects choosing the same gamble were only 0.14 and 0.12. That is, the
gamble that now involved all outcomes less than the target was chosen infrequently.
On an individual level, 30 of the 42 subjects shifted choices between pairs 3 and 5, and
33 of the 42 subjects shifted choices between pairs 4 and 6. All shifts in choice that
occurred were in the predicted directions. These results are consistent with the results
obtained in experiment 1. Note also, that the predicted and observed effects of the
translation on choice proportions is the same in pairs 4 and 6 even though the variance

<-----Page 11----->ASPIRATION LEVELS IN RISKY CHOICE

1049

relationship within the pairs (variance GI < variance GII) is reversed from pairs 3 and
5 (variance GI > variance GII).
In order to study the strength of preference exhibited between gambles in a pair, as
contrasted to the direction of choice, the subjects actual responses (A through H) were
transformed into the numerical values -7 to +7 in increments of 2, with negative
values assigned to GI. The mean of the responses, taken without regard to sign, for the
untranslated, positively translated, and negatively translated pairs were 3.69, 6.38, and
3.69, respectively. Clearly, stronger preferences were displayed for gamble pairs in
which one gamble had all outcomes exceeding the target and the other gamble had an
outcome below the target. These are precisely the pairs in which the Fishburn model
predicts a dominance relationship.
Experiment 3
A criticism that is often expressed regarding decision research is the use of college
students as subjects. Consequently, a third experiment was designed to examine the
generality of choice reversals under a translation of outcomes by using business
managers as subjects. In addition, the amounts of money involved in the risky options
were increased by multiplying all outcomes by $100,000 units. This adjustment in the
size of the outcomes was designed to make the risky options more meaningful within
the business environment of the managers.
Method. The subjects were 84 managers in several European firms from a broad
cross-section of industry. The firms included a large bank, a chemical company, a
major food chain, an airline, a consulting firm, a mining company, and several
manufacturing firms. The managers occupied a variety of top level positions within
these firms, with approximately half being in very senior positions (vice president or
above).
The stimuli consisted of 12 of the pairs of gambles used in experiment 1. The 12
pairs were the ones from Table 1 generated by a complete pairing of the gambles listed
in set 3 (six pairs) and a complete pairing of the gambles listed in set 5 (six pairs). The
subjects, however, were told to consider the amounts as being measured in $100,000
units.
The choice problems were presented to the subjects in a booklet, with each choice
problem on a separate page. The order of the choice problems was randomized and
the position of the alternatives on a page was counterbalanced. Each subject was asked
to indicate choices as a manager. The instructions indicated that a return of zero
would be used to evaluate the quality of their decisions. Subjects responded to each
choice problem separately and were not permitted to return to a previous problem
once a response was provided. Each subject was run individually in his or her own
office. They were given ample time to respond.
Results. Table 5 presents the number of times the same gamble in a pair (either GI
& GI or GII & GII) was chosen under a positive and negative translation, and the
number of times a shift in choice occurred, i.e., from GI to GII or GII to GI, for the
84 subjects for the four pairs of gambles that would be predicted to show reversals.
Similar to the results obtained in the previous experiments, the most common
pattern of choice involved the reversal from GII to GI when gambles were translated
by negative amounts. A test of the equality of the correlated proportions associated
with shifts in choice again indicated a significant difference (X2(l) = 73.33, p < 0.01).

5. Relation of Results to Other Models
The results of this study, while consistent with the predictions of the Fishburn and
Kahneman-Tversky models, indicate that the consistency principle discussed earlier is
likely to be violated whenever a translation involves crossing an aspiration level.
Furthermore, the violation of this principle is strong enough to lead to choice reversals.
In addition, the results are inconsistent with two frequently used formulations of risky
choice behavior, the mean-variance dominance model and utility theory with uniformly concave (risk averse) utility functions.
Mean- Variance Dominance
A traditional model of risky choice behavior is one based on mean-variance
dominance, a model originally introduced by Markowitz [17] and subsequently applied
by many other researchers. Individuals are presumed to choose between risky alternatives by comparing their means and variances, with higher means and lower variances
being preferred. Risk aversion is reflected in the preference for a lower rather than a
higher variance.
Since adding or subtracting a constant from both alternatives in a pair will change
means by the amount of the constant, but not affect variances, individual preferences
based on mean-variance dominance cannot be reversed by the types of translations
used in the present experiments. The preference ordering that existed for an individual
for any pair of alternatives prior to a translation would remain intact after the
translation if the mean-variance dominance model underlies choice behavior. The
extensive switching of choices observed in the experiments is therefore inconsistent
with the predictions of the mean-variance dominance model. More generally, since
additive translations of all outcomes cannot affect the magnitude of any moment
computed about the mean, the observed switching of choices provides evidence against
the adequacy of any type of mean-moment dominance model. An attempt to explain
the switching observed in this study by resorting to moments about the mean of
higher-order than the variance will therefore also fail.
Utility Theory With Concave Utility Functions
Another commonly used model of individual choice behavior is utility theory with a
uniformly concave utility function, i.e., a utility function which exhibits risk aversion

<-----Page 13----->ASPIRATION LEVELS IN RISKY CHOICE

1051

everywhere. Given the pairs of alternatives used in the experiments of this study, the
observed switching of choices is also inconsistent with the existence of uniformly
concave utility functions.
Hadar and Russell [8] introduced the concept of second-order stochastic dominance
(SSD) of risky alternative X over another risky alternative Y, with SSD occurring when
fF(x)

dx I

rG(y) dy

for all values of return r and with one strict inequality holding for at least one value of
r. In the condition for dominance of X over Y, a is the lowest possible return from
both alternatives and F(x) and G(y) are the cumulative probability distributions for
alternatives X and Y respectively. This definition of SSD implies that X dominates Y if
the area under the cumulative probability distribution for X is less than or equal to the
corresponding area under the cumulative probability distribution for Y all values of
return, and strictly less for at least one value of return.
For this paper, the important property of SSD, as Hadar and Russell demonstrated,
is that dominance of X over Y in the sense of SSD is equivalent to a preference
ordering of X over Y when an individual has a uniformly concave utility function.
That is, SSD of X over Y is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for a
preference of X over Y for all underlying utility functions that are uniformly concave.
All of the pairs of alternatives used in the three experiments, where choice reversals
were predicted by the Fishburn and Kahneman-Tversky models, could be ordered by
SSD.7 Since positive and negative translations cannot alter the relative areas under the
cumulative probability distributions for a given pair of alternatives, SSD was always
retained when both positive and negative translations were employed. Hence, preference orderings would also be retained if utility functions were uniformly concave.
Aggregated responses from all experiments for positive and negative translations of
gambles are summarized in Table 6. For the three experiments the gambles were
redesignated so that GII was always the alternative in the pair that dominated GI in
the sense of SSD, for both positive and negative translations, and hence would be the

for which SSD fails to hold, are (A, X) and (B, Y) in experiment 1 and the related choice pairings in
experiment 3. These pairs also would, according to Kahneman and Tversky, involve a "cancellation" of the
common elements in the editing phase of the choice process.

<-----Page 14----->1052

preferred alternative for an individual with a strictly concave utility function. Out of
the 660 total responses, just 159 (approximately 24%) were consistent with uniform
concavity for both positive and negative translations. For the 478 responses that
selected GII with the positive translations, 319 of them switched to GI, and hence
violated the concavity assumption, when the gambles were translated by an equal
negative amount. In contrast, for the 201 responses that chose GII for the negative
translations, only 42 switched to GI and violated concavity when the gambles were
translated by a positive amount. This differential response to positive and negative
translations, in terms of inconsistency with concavity, suggests that concavity is more
likely to be violated when alternatives are translated by negative amounts hence
bringing the aspiration level into a more influential role in determining choice.
6. Model of AspirationLevel Effects
As a way of providing a summary of the present results, along with a summary of
the ideas and results contained in the literature, the following set of propositions about
the effects of aspiration levels on risky choice has been developed. Consider Figure 1
which shows the relationship of two hypothetical gambles, GI and GII, to various
levels of aspiration. Start with the target at level t, and consider the proportion of
choices of GI denoted P(GI), and the proportion of choices of GII denoted P(GII).
PROPOSITION1. If the target is at t1, then Pt, (GI) < P,,(GII). However, P,,(GI)

(GI) and P,,(GI) will increase as t1 is lowered.
The basic idea is that decision makers will pay more attention to maximization of
gain when the minimum assured gain is increased. This prediction is consistent with
the concept of decreasing relative risk aversion [10], [13].
>

Pt,

PROPOSITION 2. If the targetis at t2, thenPt2 (GI) < P,2(GII). Furthermore,
P,2(GI)
will be close to zero.

These predictions are based on the dominance relationship suggested by the Fishburn model.
PROPOSITION
3.

If the target is at t3, then either P,3(GI)> P,3(GII) or P,3(GI) <

Pt3(GII).
However, given steeper utility functions for below target outcomes relative to equal
above target outcomes [7], [11], it is likely that Pt3(GI) < Pt3(GII).
PROPOSITION
4.

If the target is at t4, then P,4(GI) > P,4(GII).

This prediction is based on the idea that perceived risk is primarily a function of
probability of loss [19] or failure to achieve a target level of return [6].
If the target is at t5, then P,,(GI) > P,,(GII). However, P,5(GI)
P,4(GI) and P1,(GI) will decrease as t5 is increased.

PROPOSITION5.
<

The first part of this proposition is based on the existence of a convex utility
function in the loss domain [7], [11]. The second part is based on the idea that a
"ruinous loss" constraint may make minimization of maximum loss important to a
choice between gambles as the lowest value of GI approaches the ruinous outcome
value. As suggested by Crum, et al. [5] and Kahneman and Tversky [11], a ruinous loss
may lead to a concave segment in the utility function for losses.

<-----Page 15----->ASPIRATION LEVELS IN RISKY CHOICE

1053

Figure 2 presents a graphic summary of these predictions. The data from the present
study supports the propositions between t2 and t4.
In many ways, this model represents a contingent or lexicographic process of risky
choice. The assumption is that the probability of failing to reach an aspiration level
plays an important screening role in determining choice. In particular, a probability of
failure at either 0 or 1 for one alternative and not for another is likely to play the key
role in determining preferences. If the probability of failure for both alternatives is
between 0 and 1, then the probabilities of the various outcomes of the gambles are
likely to be combined or traded off with the values of the outcomes in a fashion
consistent with expectation types of models such as expected utility.
The model also suggests a decision process similar to one presented in Payne and
Braunstein [20]. The process suggested was that individuals will often make an initial
judgment about whether they are faced with an attractive set of gambles (where the
probability of winning exceeds the probability of losing) or an unattractive set (where
the probability of losing exceeds the probability of winning) before deciding on the
choice rule to be used. Empirical support for the process is presented in Payne [19],
Payne and Braunstein [20] and Ranyard [24].
Coombs and Avrunin [4] have proposed a general theory of choice behavior that
includes a related idea. These authors view choice as a form of conflict resolution. At
the individual level, the conflict involves tradeoffs among a set of different and
imperfectly correlated goals. Coombs and Avrunin identify three types of conflict
situations: approach-avoidance, approach-approach, and avoidance-avoidance. The
first situation involves choice options where each option has both good attributes
(approach) and bad attributes (avoidance). In an approach-approach situation, each
option has only good attributes. In an avoidance-avoidance situation each option has
only bad attributes. Coombs and Avruin [3] suggest that the latter two situations can
be reduced to an approach-avoidance situation and the preference function defined
similarly for all three situations. The model offered in this paper, however suggests that
the preference function used to choose among gambles is likely to be contingent on
whether the risky choice situation is an approach-approach situation (t1), an
approach-avoidance situation (t3), or an avoidance-avoidance situation (t5). In particular, for the other two possible situations with equal expected value gambles, a mixed
approach-approach and approach-avoidance situation (t2) and an approachavoidance and avoidance-avoidance situation (t4) will lead to different preference
functions.

Although the principles involved in the present model are rather simple, it is clear
that the model leads to a more complex predictive problem for decision researchers.
For one thing, the model requires the researcher to identify the decision situation as
perceived by the decision maker, especially as it relates to an aspiration level. This is
likely to be more difficult than assuming a common decision rule such as maximization of expected utility based on a common risk attitude such as risk aversion.
7.

Conclusions and Implications

The present study was motivated by two recent theories of risky choice [6] and [11]
that have placed emphasis on the concept of an aspiration level. The results obtained
provide general support for both theories. The relationship of a pair of gambles
relative to an assumed level of aspiration was varied through a translation of all
outcomes. The results demonstrate that adding or subtracting a constant amount for
all outcomes in a pair of gambles generally results in a reversal of choices within the
pair. Such a finding supports the importance of the the concept of a target return or a
reference point, or more generally, a level of aspiration, in the analysis of risky choice
behavior. Furthermore, the pattern of results suggests that a key determinant of the
effect of such translations is whether the size of the translation is sufficient to result in
one gamble having outcome values either all above or all below the target, while the
alternative gamble has outcome values that are both above and below the target.
The prevailing view about risk attitude in management science research, for both
normative and positive models, ignores the aspiration level concept and assumes that
decision makers are uniformly risk averse. Results of this paper, in conjunction with
other studies cited earlier, indicate that this prevailing assumption is inadequate from a
descriptive viewpoint.
The consensus emerging from empirical studies is that a more descriptive set of
assumptions about risk attitudes is one where (1) the utility (or value) function is
defined in terms of initial wealth and changes in wealth, rather than terminal wealth,
where (2) changes in wealth are evaluated relative to an aspiration level or target
return, with gains (losses) being defined as a change in wealth above (below) the target
return, where (3) risk preference, when ruinous loss is not a concern, is a mixture of
risk seeking for losses and risk aversion for gains, and where (4) ruinous loss
considerations lead to lexicographic choice behavior that screens alternatives out from
further consideration. This characterization, which is discussed in detail by Kahneman
and Tversky [11] and Libby and Fishburn [15], has not yet been explored in the
context of management science models.
For positive models, which tend to be judged by the accuracy of their aggregate
predictions rather than accuracy of underlying assumptions, it is unclear whether these
more descriptive assumptions about risk attitude will lead to models with improved
aggregate predictions while maintaining similar levels of parsimony, analytical tractability, and the requisite second-order conditions. Only future research efforts will be
able to resolve these important issues. A strong case for examining the impact of
increased descriptive accuracy of assumptions in positive models is provided by Simon
[27].
For normative models, which are designed to aid in the decision process, the issue of
descriptive reality of assumptions can be put in clearer focus. Normative models are
more likely to be evaluated by the accuracy of their assumptions, particularly assumptions that relate to risk attitudes of the decision maker for whom the model is designed.

<-----Page 17----->ASPIRATION LEVELS IN RISKY CHOICE

1055

Inadequate assumptions in this circumstance may lead to rejection of a model by the
decision maker no matter how elegant or how easy it is to deal with analytically, unless
it can be demonstrated that model results are insensitive to the challenged assumptions. In addition, trying to change the risk attitude of a decision maker to match the
standard assumption of uniform risk aversion, an approach apparently suggested by
Keeney and Raiffa [13, p. 200], is questionable. Incorporation of more realistic
assumptions about risk attitudes in normative models offers a more promising prospect
for research, with a potential of improving the track record of implementation of
normative management science models. This is true even though analytical tractability
will undoubtedly be sacrificed for approximate solutions. The need to engage in such
research is aptly summarized by Simon [27, p. 498]:8
.. . decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world,
or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach dominates the
other . . ."

In number one I have a 40%

And in number two I have
no chance of loss.
Think I'm going to go with

Whereas there's a 100%chance
I'll lose money in problem two
(GII).
Most of the percentage lies
where I'd have 50%chance
of losing $30.
Ummm - well I don't like
the looks of losing $85.
I think I'd go with outcome one
because the least amount of
money I'd have to give in
outcome two is $20.
And that . . . $20 is still a

lot of money.
I rather take my chances
and try and least gain some
money
so I take outcome one.

And there is a 50%chance
of winning $30 in experiment two (GI).
However, in problem B in
experiment one (GI) there
is a 50%chance of winning
$74
which offsets the problem
of 40%probability in C
of losing $25.
Yet by comparison in
experiment two you win
money in any of the
three probabilities.
Therefore I would choose
number two.

Number two (GI) there's a
40%chance of losing $25

prelude picking it.
And, a 50%chance of winning $74
which would be pretty
great.
But, I would still say
that the possible loss
- 40% is possible loss.
I'm not going to pick

I'm going to pick number

And, a 50%chance of winning.
But, you don't win that much.
And, if you lose there's that
40%chance of losing $85
which is quite a bit.
Number one is an automatic
loss probability.
Probably being around 3550 dollars.
In number two you do have
a 50%chance of winning
based on that, I'm going to
go with number two.

O.K., I'm looking at

Probability A and amount
A. Comparing the amounts
- the same.
Although, the probability
for gamble one is much
better.
So, it's not bad, $30.
So I move to B and compare them.
But, in gamble one B is
not too good a chance.
It's not worth it.
It's not worth too much.
Whereas, gamble two B
is good chance of losing something.
So, I move to C in gamble
two.
It is very good. 50%
chance of making $74.
Whereas gamble one,
30%chance of making
$40.
So, I think I'd go with
one. Simply because
you can't lose.
There's a pretty good
chance of losing too.

Gamble one is an even

Probability for gamble one
is much lower.
The probability is higher
in gamble two.
The amounts was still a

Look at C. Gamble one
there's 1/2 chance of
winning a little bit.
Whereas C in gamble two
you're going to lose a
Well, gamble two you don't ...
you're going to lose no

Gamble one is a big chance of

So, I'd go with gamble two.
