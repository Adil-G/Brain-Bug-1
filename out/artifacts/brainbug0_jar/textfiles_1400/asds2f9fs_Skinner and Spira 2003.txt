<-----Page 0----->Trust and control ± a symbiotic
relationship?
Denise Skinner and Laura F. Spira

Abstract Traditional approaches to management which incorporate top-down systems of
control do not readily accommodate the need, imposed by a changing business environment,
for more ¯exible methods of harnessing the knowledge and commitment of employees. In this
situation, trust has been recognized as an important factor for organizational success but any
relaxation of control may be constrained by the demands of accountability to internal and
external stakeholders. In this paper, we illustrate the complexity of the relationship between trust
and control in the context of corporate governance by examining the internal audit technique of
control self-assessment. We argue that the dependence of control processes on trust has been
insuf®ciently explored and that neglecting to consider the reciprocal nature of trust relationships
from an employee perspective may hamper the effectiveness of control systems designed to
enhance accountability.

Introduction
Lenin is alleged to have said that while trust is good, control is better, yet, in the current
business context, a fundamental problem facing managers is how to relinquish control without
losing it entirely. Traditional approaches to the management function were founded on the
perceived need for close control of the work and behavior of the lower echelons if organizational
goals were to be achieved, and these views still have resonance today. However, changes in
the business environment, work and organizational forms have all increased the need to
manage at a distance, to seek commitment from every individual and to facilitate the utilization
of intangible resources such as tacit knowledge. Within this context, trust has been argued
to confer numerous bene®ts on the organization, including competitive advantage (Fairholm
and Fairholm, 1999), individual and organizational effectiveness (Roy and Dugal, 1998) and
the creation of commitment (Lamsa and Savolainen, 2000). Yet, there still remains a need for
accountability, both internal and external, which necessitates the implementation of control
systems and procedures.
Within this paper we consider the subject of corporate governance, ostensibly an issue of
control, illustrating and exploring some of the complexities inherent in the relationship between
trust and control by examining the technique of control self assessment. We suggest that a
better understanding of the complex dynamics of the inter-personal relationships which
underpin control mechanisms is necessary if the effectiveness of governance systems and
procedures is to be increased.

<-----Page 1----->The nature of control and trust
A useful starting point is to consider the nature of control and of trust and the relationship
between the two as outlined within the literature. Both control and trust are, in essence,
mechanisms for managing risk and uncertainty. Traditionally they have been conceptualized as
opposing alternatives (Knights et al., 2001) for ``if you control me you don't trust me!; and ``it is
true that if you do not trust me enough . . . you would like to monitor, control and enforce me
in some way'' (Castelfranchi and Falcone, 2000, p. 812). Seligman (1999), among others,
identi®es the degree of certainty about future outcomes as the key differentiator between the
need for control and the need for trust. He equates control with con®dence and argues that it is
based on a condition of certainty, on knowing what to expect in a situation. Castelfranchi and
Falcone (2000) describe control as a meta action with two principle aims:
1. ascertaining whether another action has been successfully executed or a desired state has
been realized or maintained; and/or
2. dealing with possible deviations and unforeseen events in a way that achieves a positive
outcome.
Both of these aims have resonance with expectations of any audit process, as does Seligman's
(1999) linking of the idea of control and sanctions in the creation of con®dence, speci®cally
the ability to impose sanctions if a partner fails to live up to an agreement, an ability which is
recognized by the other party.
Within the literature, trust is described as interpersonal and impersonal. Interpersonal trust
is something which is essentially personal, relational and which exists between two parties, a
trustor and a trustee (Husted, 1998). It can only be granted by, and gained from, individuals
whether singly or as part of a wider group. It involves emotions and values and it evolves from
our experience of working with others. To trust requires not only the con®dence that another
shares our commitment but a belief that he or she will not take any action which would be
harmful to our interests and, further, that he or she will proactively seek to protect our position,
thus reducing our vulnerability.
Although sharing similar characteristics, a variant of trust is also identi®ed which is more
detached and impersonal. Seligman (1999) argues that trust becomes necessary in conditions
of uncertainty when con®dence is not possible, for example, when interacting with strangers
where the absence of familiarity or shared norms makes it impossible to predict behavior.
Modernity, he suggests, is life among strangers in which we are unable to assume familiarity
(although we constantly attempt to do so). La Porta et al. (1997) argue that trust is essential in
large organizations for ensuring co-operation between strangers or people who interact with
each other infrequently. Dunn (1988) describes trust as a strategic mechanism for coping with
uncertainty over time, and a policy for handling the freedom of other human agents or agencies.
He also suggests that the nature of modern life makes it rational to invest trust in well-designed
institutions, rather than individuals. Shapiro (1987) describes impersonal trust in terms of social
networks in which principals invest resources, authority or responsibility in others to act on
their behalf for some uncertain future return. Specialization and differentiation require that these
agents are also responsible for the collection, processing and interpretation of data which
cannot be easily veri®ed by its recipients because of their lack of expertise or access.
Knights et al. (2001) argue, that viewing control and trust as opposites is misleading, as
the reality is that they are interdependent. Similarly, Reed (2001) argues that trust and control
are actually two sides of the same analytical coin and explains them as opposing ends of a
continuum. At one extreme (control) discretionary content and behavioral autonomy are totally
excluded from the work relationship while at the other end (trust) they are maximized. He calls
it a negotiated relationship and this better re¯ects the relational, complex nature of trust and
control at every level of organizations, not least because, as Knights et al. (2001) observe, it
is often impossible to disentangle trust invested in speci®c individuals from that placed in
institutional mechanisms.

<-----Page 2----->In either case, to trust inevitably leads to an increased vulnerability to the behavior of the person
or persons in whom we have placed that trust. The degree of this vulnerability may vary on the
nature of the trust given, whether it is conditional or unconditional. Jones and George (1998)
argue that conditional trust, founded on predictable, reliable routines and where less is invested
in the relationship, is suf®cient to facilitate many of the exchanges necessary within organizations
but that it is unconditional trust which provides true competitive advantage, through synergy
and the creation of tacit knowledge. From a management perspective, new approaches
to work such as self managing teams, cross-functional collaboration and larger managerial
spans of control have made monitoring increasingly dif®cult and unrealistic (Spreitzer and
Mishra, 1999). As direct surveillance of employees becomes impractical and employees often
have more complete knowledge and information relating to their work than their managers, the
nature of management control and the role, and extent, of trust increasingly becomes an
issue. Yet, through delegation of authority managers inevitably increase their vulnerability, for
employees may behave opportunistically, personal needs may con¯ict with collective needs of
the organization or there may be incompetence or ignorance on the part of those in whom the
authority is placed.

The corporate governance context
The reciprocal and complex nature of trust-control relationships is highlighted in the on-going
debate about corporate governance in the UK. This was set in motion by ®nancial scandals
of the 1980s (for example, BCCI, Maxwell, Polly Peck) which led to a failure of trust in the
mechanisms of corporate accountability ± ®nancial reporting and the independent audit
process that gives credibility to ®nancial statements. The rationale for audit arises when there is
an accountability relationship between two parties and it is logistically dif®cult for monitoring of
the accountable party to be undertaken. Within this relationship, resources have been entrusted
by the principal to the agent (by investors to the board of directors) but distance between them
makes an accountability mechanism (®nancial reporting) necessary, to control the agent. The
audit function acts to make this mechanism trustworthy. However, this implies the investment
of trust by the principal in the audit function itself ± both in the auditor and in the process.
Paradoxically, the existence of auditing both reinforces distrust (of agents) and demands trust
(from principals). Furthermore, in forming judgements based on evidence supplied by agents,
auditors must themselves trust.
Although models of internal control are predicated on control of lower organizational levels,
recent events in the USA at Enron, WorldCom and other companies suggest that controls on
fraudulent activity at the highest organizational level are either missing or ineffective. Cullinan
and Sutton (2002) provide evidence from the USA during 1998 and 1999 that demonstrates
that more than 70 percent of ®nancial statement fraud uncovered[1] during that period involved
the top executive of the organization concerned, with a further 19 percent involving other senior
management. Cullinan and Sutton (2002, p. 301) note ``the accounting profession's cultural
af®nity with the members of upper management'', suggesting that such fraud is not effectively
controlled because auditors and audit committee members may be too trusting, too reliant on
assumptions about behavior at higher organizational levels.
A further complexity in the trust-control relationship is associated with the cost of control.
Beyond a certain level, the additional costs of establishing further control may be perceived as
bringing very little further bene®t in terms of assurance. Controls at a lower organizational level
are relatively inexpensive to set up but controls at higher organizational levels may be viewed as
impeding ef®ciency, carrying extra costs. A form of trust comes into play here which could be
described as ``trust in ignorance''[2] ± senior management, reluctant to incur the costs of
instituting further controls, rely on the hope that employees will not realize that exploitable
loopholes exist.
The usual response to a failure of trust is a demand for greater control and regulation. Shapiro
(1987) describes the growth in agency relationships which underpin modern economic activity,
analyzing the ways in which individuals manage the risks involved and identifying the need for
impersonal trust when principals and agents have no social contact. ``Guardians of trust'' ±
institutions, professions, regulatory agencies ± make such relationships possible. Pixley (1999)

<-----Page 3----->suggests that these impersonal guardians simulate personalized forms of trust and social
control through the setting up and surveillance of procedural norms and structural constraints
but also notes that disinterested and independent regulation is fraught with dif®culty. For quis
custodiet ipsos custodies? ± who guards the guardians? Shapiro pictures a spiraling structure:
apparent failures of trust provoke a further round of regulation which itself relies on trust. This,
in turn, creates a paradox in which more extensive controls and the search for transparent
information diminish the scope for judgement, discretion and innovation and increase the
likelihood of those so distrusted living down to expectations.
The development of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance[3], with which companies
listed on the London Stock Exchange must comply, was designed to boost con®dence in the
audit process by strengthening auditor independence and clarifying boards' responsibility for
establishing explicit governance processes and sound internal control systems. Similar codes
have been introduced in other countries. However, it would appear from the Enron collapse
that the introduction of recommended governance systems and procedures, such as the
appointment of non-executive directors to audit committees with the intention of strengthening
the audit function, may not always be effective. Although the in¯uence of such mechanisms is
examined within the corporate governance literature, conclusions about their effectiveness are
equivocal and one issue that has not been widely explored in this context is the impact of the
relationship between control and trust.
Roberts (2001) reconceptualizes the corporate governance problem to focus on the effects
of accountability processes on corporate governance practices. He distinguishes between
``individualizing'' effects, which constitute the self as solitary with an external and instrumental
relationship to others, and ``socializing'' effects which constitute the self as interdependent
with others, with a moral as well as an instrumental dimension to relationships. Individualizing
effects are associated with remote governance practices, hierarchical accountability and the
disciplinary operation of market mechanisms, predicated on, and reinforcing, distrust. As
Roberts demonstrates, these effects may undermine governance mechanisms. Socializing
effects, in contrast, are related to face-to-face accountability in relationships where power is
relatively equal, with the potential to generate trust and make corporate governance mechanisms
work more effectively. While acknowledging that socializing processes are a normal feature of
all work relationships, Roberts focuses his analysis on boardroom interaction, as does much
of the literature on corporate governance. In exploring the relationship between trust and
control, we highlight processes which take place at lower organizational levels, in the context of
internal audit.

The role of internal audit
The traditional view of internal audit could be seen as the embodiment of management
distrust. Internal auditors have acted as monitors ± even policemen ± checking, on behalf of
management, employees' compliance with internal control procedures. They have long sought
to throw off this image, to assert their professionalism and to present themselves as consultants
(Morgan, 1979; Kalbers, 1995; Fogarty, 2000). Alongside this aspiration, commercial pressures
have required the internal audit function to demonstrate added value. In parallel with developments in external audit[5], the focus of internal audit has shifted over time from validation of
transactions, involving detailed and extensive checking, to systems auditing where checking
is based on a sampling approach, and to the more recent development of a business risk
approach which focuses checking on key risk areas, identi®ed by taking a holistic view of
business operations.
Internal audit is central to the corporate governance debate, through the emphasis on internal
control systems and their role in governance. Power (1997, 2000) observes a shift in the
location of regulatory activity from state to non-state bodies and into organizations themselves,
relying on systems for self-regulation operating in ``internal regulatory space''. Internal control
systems, once the concern of individual companies only, are now seen as key components of
corporate governance and ``. . . the subject of internal control, once a guaranteed remedy for
sleeplessness, has made a spectacular entry into regulatory and political agendas'' (Power,
1997, p. 57).

<-----Page 4----->Since the publication of the Turnbull guidance in 1999, the combined code (section D.2)
requires directors to report publicly on the effectiveness of internal control systems. The effects
on companies of ensuring compliance with this requirement have yet to be assessed, but there
is a clear expectation that internal audit will have an important role in providing the necessary
assurance to boards and companies without an internal audit function are directed to review
on a regular basis the possible need for one. Detailed discussion of the development and
processes of the internal audit function is beyond the scope of this paper but, to illustrate
the tension between the concept and the reality of trust and control in this context, we wish to
focus on one technique adopted by internal auditors in the course of this shift away from
detailed compliance checking to a holistic risk approach. This is control self-assessment (CSA),
sometimes control risk self-assessment (CRSA).

CSA
The CSA technique was pioneered in major oil companies in the 1980s, at a time when
internal audit departments were being placed under close scrutiny during business process
reengineering reviews, and when total quality management programs were introducing the idea
of ``bottom up'' control systems and employee ``empowerment''. CSA can be undertaken by
questionnaire survey but more commonly involves internal auditors in facilitating workshop
sessions at which employees are asked to analyze the control and risk aspects of the work
for which they are responsible. This then provides the framework around which the internal
auditor plans a program of veri®cation. One advantage claimed for the CSA approach is that
it gives the internal auditor a better grasp of ``soft'' controls which may be overlooked in a
traditional checklist approach. The documentation and testing of ®nancial and information
systems controls is likely to be straightforward but communication systems and decisionmaking processes, where control weaknesses may pose signi®cant risks, are not easily veri®ed
or tested. Another advantage cited is the more effective focus of the audit process where
controls are explicitly linked to business objectives, rather than tested in isolation. Additionally,
employees are involved in the process of identifying areas of weakness and strength, using their
insight into the practical operations of the organization and giving them ownership of the control
process.
There is an underlying and implicit trust which underpins this approach to control and which
centers around an expectation of technically competent role performance, ®duciary obligation
and responsibility (Barber, 1983). This may be at odds with the self interest of individuals
concerned and increases the importance of aligning individual and organizational goals through
recruitment, socialization and reward structures (Pixley, 1999; Spreitzer and Mishra, 1999). The
technique clearly enables the internal auditor to move away from explicit compliance monitoring
and direct checking of employees' actions but the ef®cacy of this process depends crucially on
trust. The internal auditor must trust employees to offer truthful accounts of their experience
of company processes and systems. Perhaps more importantly, employees must trust the
facilitator, colleagues and the self-assessment process suf®ciently that they feel able to be
honest about potential system weaknesses which may currently work to the employees'
advantage and which would continue to do so if undetected. Similarly, employees may fear
blame if areas of risk are inadvertently omitted from their analysis. In the organizational world
relationships are rarely equal and power, dominance and coercion are often the basis on which
the division of labor is arranged and social order is maintained (Seligman, 1999). Thus any
action which increases our vulnerability and dependence on others may appear inappropriate
or even foolhardy and Miller (1992) notes that employee suspicions are a major obstacle to any
successful worker participation. Miller (1992) also argues that the short-term incentive to cheat
is ever present. This may be because reward is linked to success, for example the need for
many high level managers to develop good short-term pro®t ®gures for their own career
purposes or it may arise from the need to avert blame. This con¯ict between self-interest and
collective interest is a theme which Dewitte and DeCremer (2001) also identify as signi®cant in
the development of cooperation and trust. They suggest that the belief that others will make
reciprocal contributions rather than be exploitative may be necessary to justify a decision to
contribute to the common good.

<-----Page 5----->This raises questions about the nature of the trust that exists between the internal auditor and
the employees. These relationships may exhibit ``swift trust'' mirroring the temporary systems
described by Meyerson et al. (1996) formed to undertake a signi®cant non routine activity within
a set deadline. In common with the audit processes referred to here, those involved in such
systems are interdependent and therefore vulnerability, in the context of the task, is high. There
is a potential for damage to the individuals depending on outcomes and there is uncertainty
about the actions of others in the absence of shared experience, reciprocal disclosure and
familiarity which is likely to be resolved on the basis of predispositions, assumptions and theories.
Or is it a calculus based trust (Lewicki and Bunker, 1996) based on assumed consistency of
behavior grounded both in the expectation of reward and the fear of the consequences of doing
otherwise? Lewicki and Bunker (1996) suggest that over time, this may develop into knowledge
based trust and then to identi®cation based trust but does this happen in these relationships, is
it the same from both perspectives and what are the effects?
Proponents of CSA address the value of the technique for management and for the internal
auditor but little attention is paid to the employees' role, other than an implicit assumption
that their sense of ``ownership'' in the process will prove to be a positive advantage. Wade
and Wynne (1999) provide case study descriptions of the implementation of CSA in a variety
of private and public sector organizations. Much attention is paid to the facilitation process
and detailed advice is offered to internal auditors on how to conduct workshops. Pitfalls
are examined brie¯y and it is noted that the success of CSA may depend on a supportive
organizational culture but there is no discussion of the process from the viewpoint of those
participating in the workshop sessions. It is quite possible that employees may view CSA as
driving responsibility and accountability for control systems down in to the company, not only
``empowering'' employees but also making them responsible for de®ciencies.
The Turnbull guidance stresses the importance of ``embedding'' internal control procedures so
that compliance does not consist of a box-ticking exercise identifying that controls are in place
but goes beyond this to offer assurance of the effectiveness of the controls. The degree of
``embeddedness'' may be dif®cult to determine from directors' statements in ®nancial reports
but could prove crucial if risks crystallize: for example, the introduction of the new offence of
``corporate killing'' emphasizes the likelihood that the detail of company risk management
procedures may come under much closer scrutiny in future (Belcher, 2000). CSA would appear
to provide a valuable method of demonstrating such ``embeddedness'' but a lack of objective
research into the interpersonal dynamics surrounding its use may result in CSA becoming
a further tool which super®cially demonstrates compliance with governance ``best practice''
without making any fundamental improvement.

Concluding thoughts
We have used the CSA process to illustrate a number of important issues relating to the
interdependence not only of control and trust but also of aspects of trust described in the
literature as interpersonal and impersonal. It is clear that these control procedures are ®rmly
grounded in the reciprocal relationships between individuals and groups which exist at various
levels within and between institutions. It is also clear that trust is both inherent and inevitable in
the nature of the control process. Yet, there is a limited understanding of the nature of the
relationships on which the process is built and much to suggest that tensions and con¯icts of
interest are inevitable. To date the primary emphasis has been managerialist and, despite the
reciprocal nature of trust, the perspective of the employees is one which has been neglected,
yet it is clearly key to making practices such as CSA effective.
External demands for accountability, such as those arising from apparent failures of the
corporate governance system, may lead to the imposition of internal control processes which
depend crucially on trust by those working within an organization. In consequence, we argue
that insuf®cient understanding of the relationship between control and trust may undermine the
effectiveness of such processes. We have used a speci®c internal audit technique to illustrate
this and we suggest that there is considerable scope for further investigation in this area.

<-----Page 6----->Theorists have provided a taxonomy of trust: seeking to identify the types of trust generated
in speci®c relationships such as that between auditor and auditee may help in designing
appropriate control processes. The extent to which auditees place trust in the process of audit,
in the auditor (in terms of both the ``auditor'' label and as an individual) and in the organization
itself could be explored from an interdisciplinary perspective, building on existing knowledge
both of audit and of human resource management.

Notes
1 Cullinan and Sutton examined accounting and auditing enforcement releases (AAERs) issued by the SEC
after the discovery of materially misstated ®nancial statements, thus dealing with fraud that has not been
discovered during the audit process. An AAER describes the fraud and the actions taken against those
responsible.
2 We are grateful to Sarah Blackburn for this idea.
3 The Combined Code of Best Practice comprises the recommendations of the Cadbury, Greenbury and
Hampel Committees, supplemented by the guidance for directors issued by the Turnbull Committee.
Directors of quoted companies are required to state in the annual report that the code's provisions have
been met or to explain any non-compliance.
4 Competitive pressures in the market for audit, coupled with technological development, have led to
changes in the external audit process which is now often based on a business risk approach,
characterised by a ``top down'' testing of controls, greater reliance on analytical procedures and reduced
substantive testing (Lemon et al., 2000).
