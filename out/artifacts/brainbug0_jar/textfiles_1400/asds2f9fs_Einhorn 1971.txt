T h e present research was designed to assess the effect of two variables as
they affect the use of nonlinear, noncompensatory models in decision making.
These two variables were type of decision task and a m o u n t of information.
The former variable was found to have a marked effect on the kind of comb i n a t i o n model used b y subjects, while the latter variable had a significant
effect on the accuracy with which the various models could adequately represent the decision process. T h e m a j o r findings showed considerable use of
the nonlinear, noncompensatory models with differential use in the two decision tasks used. The results for a m o u n t of information suggest t h a t subjects
use complex combinations of models (or compound models) in order to
simplify the situation cognitively. In addition, the claim t h a t decision
makers do n o t use additive models in their strategies is given support b y
these data.

INTRODUCTION
A major problem in decision making is understanding the methods by
which people combine information to make evaluative decisions. The combining process has typically been conceptualized in terms of a linear
model in which components are added together to form an overall evaluation. Consequently, linear regression techniques have commonly been
used to approximate the cognitive processes underlying decision making.
The use of this model implies that the decision maker somehow adds together component cues in order to come to some overall evaluation or
decision.
The use of a linear model to approximate the methods by which decision makers combine information has been suggested by many researchers. Anderson (1958), for example, has used an "averaging" model
in dealing with impression and attitude formation; Hammond
and associates (e.g., Hammond,
1955; I-Iammond, Hursch, & Todd, 1964; Hammond & Summers, 1965; Hursch, Hammond,
& I.iursch, 1964) have inT h e following research was part of a Ph.D. dissertation submitted to the Dep a r t m e n t of Psychology, Wayne State University. The author wishes to acknowledge

vestigated the combining of component cues using Brunswik's lens model
as the theoretical basis for their work, and Naylor and associates (e.g.,
Dudyeha & Naylor, 1966a, 1966b; Naylor & Schenek, 19'68) have also
used the Brunswikian framework. In the clinical decision making area,
Hoffman and his associates (e.g., Itoffman, 1960, 1968; tIoffman, Slovie,
& Rorer, 1968; Slovic, 1966), have dealt with the use of linear models for
combining clinical information.
The general finding from these and other researchers has been that
the linear model provides a good fit for the obtained data (Goldberg,
1968). One reason for this good fit of the linear model in many different
areas of decision making may be that the linear model can still provide a
very good approximation even when there are significant nonlinear relationships in the data (Yntema & Torgerson, 1961). Furthermore, the research that has dealt with nonlinear models has typically shown that
nonlinear germs add little to the explained variance of judgments. Few
studies have shown the general superioriey of the nonlinear methods for
combining information. In those studies that do show nonlinear use, the
results have generally not been impressive (e.g., Wiggins & Hoffman,
1968; however, see Slovic, 1969).
Given the large amount of research supporting the use of the linear
model in a variety of situations, it would seem that the persistent search
for nonlinear methods used by decision makers would be abandoned.
However, the search continues for some of the following reasons: (1)
Decision makers do not believe that they are using linear models in their
cognitive activity. This seems to be especially true for clinical decision
makers who feel that nonlinear models should be more representative of
what they say they are doing. (2) Although the bulk of the research does
favor the linear model there is some research showing use of nonlinear
methods for combining information. (3) The exact nature of the nonlinear
models that are being used by decision makers should be made explicit,
since this would lead to greater accuracy in the quantification of cognigive processes in decision making.
NONLINEAR COMBINATION MODELS
While researchers have dealt with the linear model, there are other
data-combination models available. Coombs and Kao (1955), Coombs
(1964), and Dawes (1964a, 1964b) have specified what they have called
nonlinear, noncompensatory models for combining information. These
models, viz., the conjunctive, disjunctive, and lexieographic were heretofore primarily eonceptuaI and not specified mathematically. Using a
theoretical model based on utility assumptions, precise mathematical
functions have been developed to approximate both the conjunctive and

<-----Page 2----->N O N L I N E A R , N O N C O ~ f P E N S A T O R Y MODELS

3

disjunctive models (Einhorn, 1970). For the disjunctive model the
formulation involved the following equation:
N

U

N

M [1/(ai -- Xi)] b~or )~ -- bilog (a~ - Xi) = logU
i=1

(1)

i=i

where
U = utility of the multidimensional stimulus (height of the response
surface);
X~ = variables or component cues;
a~ = some arbitrary value above the asymptotic level;
b~ = weighting factors for the variables or cues.
The disjunctive model is here approximated by a hyperbolic response
surface. The use of this surface provides that a stimulus objee~ will have
a high utility if it contains an extremely high score on only one of the
attributes. This is consistent with the disjunctive model since a stimulus
object mus~ have a high score on at least one attribute to have a high
utility. The value for a~ is set arbitrarily above the highest value of X~,
and b~ can be found by a least squares technique such as multiple regression (after the log transformation has been performed).
For the conjunctive model the formulation involved a parabolic response surface,

U = II
i=I

hr

or

(2)

i =1

In the conjunctive model the highest utility occurs when there are equal
amounts for the variables X~ so that this approximation approaches a
multiple cutoff procedure (no compensation is allowed for).
These two models can be fitted to data by using a least squares procedure such as multiple regression in order to obtain the weighting parameters. Once these weights are obtained, one can cross-validate on another
sample. This was done in a preliminary study which showed that predictions made from the nonlinear models correlated significantly higher
with the criterion of actual judgments than predictions made from the
linear model (Einhorn, 1969).

Objectives
The present research focused on two variables as they were thought to
affect the use of the various models. The first variable was the type of
decision task or problem. In talking about cognitive structures for the
integration of information, Sehroder, Driver, and Streufert (1967) have

<-----Page 3----->I-IILLEL J. E I N H O R N

stated "The problem in regard to task properties may be stated as follows: what characteristics of tasks produce similar effects on intervening
structure and, consequently, on the differentiation and integration involved in behavior [p. 31] ?" These authors view information processing
behavior as an interactive process between environmental and individual
factors, so that one must investigate the role of task dimensions on the
possible use of different strategies in decision making. An example of the
possible effects of the task come from Webster (196¢). In dealing with
the interview situation, Webster found that interviewers look for negative
information on which to disqualify an applicant. This search for negative
information is similar to using a conjunctive model since the subject is
evaluated on his minimum ability. One reason for the use of such a model
can be traced back to the fact that the cost of a false positive to the
interviewer is high. If the cost of a false positive is high, one might expeer greater use of a conjunctive model as compared with a linear model,
since under the former model the probability of failure because of an
excessive lack of an ability is smaller than under the linear model. Therefore, where the cost of a false positive is high to the decision maker, a
conjunctive model may be used more often. (One might compare the costs
of false positives and false negatives with the concept of "noxity" used
by Schroder et al., while "hits" might correspond to "eueity.") Other
possible factors in the decision task might include: Involvement of the
decision maker, amount of payoff, familiarity of the task to the decision
maker, and complexity of the task.
The second factor thought to affect the use of the various models was
the amount of information presented to the decision maker. Many researchers have felt that when there is a great deal of information, the
decision maker has to somehow simplify the situation (Simon, 1955;
Miller, 1956; Garner, 1962; Yntema & Torgerson, 1961). Goldberg (1968),
in a review of the literature dealing with clinical decision making, has
suggested that the linear model implies a simple cognitive process.
However, one must make a conceptual distinction between a model's
mathematical simplicity and the cognitive processes it purports
to represent. It may be that the linear model is mathematically simple,
but this in no way implies that it is easy to use eognitively. This is an
extremely important distinction, since the use of the nonlinear, noncompensatory models, although more complex mathematically, may in fact
be easier to use cognitively. Simon (1955) has suggested, for example, that
one way to simplify a complex decision task might be to use a cutoff-type
procedure. This is a conjunctive model, which although more complex
mathematically than the linear model, may be easier to use eognitively.
Accordingly, it was hypothesized that as the decision maker is given more

<-----Page 4----->NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS

5

information on which to base his decisions--approaching an information
overload condition he would be more likely to use the nonlinear, noncompensatory models than the linear model. If, however, Goldberg and
others are correct, then one should expect increased use of the linear model
as the amount of information is increased.
METHOD

Tasks
Two separate tasks were used in this research project. The first task
involved a job preference decision problem. Subjects were presented with
various jobs within their own occupation and were given a certain amount
of information about each job. They were then asked to choose among
these jobs (for themselves) on the basis of the information about each
job. The second decision problem consisted of choosing among applicants
to graduate school in psychology. Again, information was provided concerning each of the candidates. The two tasks required special subject
populations. The first task required subjects who had made an occupational choice while subjects in the second task had to be faculty members
or admissions officials in psychology departments.

Subjects
For the job preference study, subjects who had made occupational
choices were needed. This was accomplished by obtaining subjects who
were working toward either an M.B.A. (N = 24) degree or an M.A. degree in industrial engineering (N ~- 15). The total sample size was therefore N ----39. All subjects had made occupational choices and were working during the day at their respective jobs.
For the graduate selection study, subjects were faculty members and
last year graduate students in psychology. Faculty members came from
three universities in the area (N-=-26). In addition, four final-year
graduate students who had just received their Ph.D. degrees were also
included, thereby making the total sample size N = 30.

Experimental Procedure
For the iob preference study, subjects were asked to complete the task
in group sessions lasting about an hour. Subjects could take as much time
as they deemed necessary to complete the task. The experimental situation consisted of presenting 15 hypothetical jobs to the subject and then
asking him to rank order the jobs in terms of his preference for them.
Once this had been accomplished, a second set of jobs was also presented
and the subject was asked to rank order the new set of experimental

<-----Page 5----->6

stimuli. The experimental stimuli were selected so that they would hopefully show differences between the use of the various models if sueh differences existed. This point has been elaborated elsewhere (Einhorn,
1970), but is relevant here since the stimuli cannot be considered a random sample of all possible values for the stimuli.
The experimental conditions consisted of presenting varying amounts of
information to the decision maker by having either two, four, or six pieces
of information per hypothetical stimulus, i.e., the dimensionality of the
stimuli was varied from two to six attributes. For the two-attribute condition, amount of money and the chance to use special interests and
abilities were presented. For the four-variable condition, the first two
were used in addition to location and the lack of close supervision. For
the six-variable ease, flexibility of hours and social relationships with
co-workers were used in addition to the preceding four. Each of these
variables was presented in the form of a seven-point scale. This scale
varied from (1) Greatly below average, to (7) Greatly above average,
with a middle point of (4) Average. Since all the subjects had made an
occupational choice, the ratings on the different attributes referred to
jobs in that occupation. For example, a rating of (4) on amount of money
meant that this job pays an average amount for this particular
occupation.
Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three information conditions. They were instructed to rank order the 15 jobs according to their
preference. A second sample of jobs was then presented to serve as the
cross-validation sample. However, a double cross-validation procedure
was used so that each set of data served as the cross-validation sample
for the other set. After subjects finished the second set of stimuli, they
were asked to rate the importance of each of the attributes making up
the stimuli to their decision making on an eight-point scale. It was emphasized that the importance rating should reflect how the subject used
the attributes ir~ this tadc, not how he felt about the attributes in general.
Finally, the subject was asked to fill out a post-experimental questionnaire that dealt with questions concerning the difficulty of the task,
fatigue effects, and the interest and motivation for doing the task. Moreover, the subject was asked to indicate any strategy that he felt he might
have used in completing the task. It was hoped that this would lead to
greater insight into how decision makers formulate strategies in complex
decisions of this type.
Essentially the same procedure was used in the graduate selection
study. In this ease, faculty members were given the experimental materials
and were asked to complete them within two weeks. The return rate was
65%. Using the same paradigm, the subjects were presented with 15 hy-

<-----Page 6----->NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY

MODELS

pothetieai candidates to graduate school in psychology. They were asked
to rank order the candidates in terms of their acceptability into the
graduate program. After they did this they were presented with a second
set of candidates and were asked to rank order this set. The experimental
conditions again consisted of presenting the decision maker with either
two, four, or six pieces of information per stimulus. In the two-attribute
condition the information consisted of the Verbal (V) and Quantitative
(Q) scores on the Graduate Record Examination expressed as percentiles.
For the four-attribute condition the variables were V, Q, grade point
average (G.P.A.) on a four-point scale, and status of the undergraduate
school. The latter variable was expressed on a seven-point scale and was
presented as ratings of the schools by the association of university professors. For the six-attribute ease, the previous four attributes were used
in addition to the number of science courses the candidate had taken in
undergraduate school and the applicant's score on the psychology portion
of the G.R.E.
The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three information
conditions. It should be noted however, that there was greater difficulty
in obtaining responses to the task when there were six attributes per
stimulus. This necessitated handing out proportionally more questionnaires for this condition in order to have equal cell frequencies for the
three information conditions. After the subject completed the rankings on
the two data sets, he rated the importance of the attributes and completed
the post-experimental questionnaire.

Statistical Analysis
For each of the models, a linear regression procedure was used to find
the best fitting beta weights for each of the attributes. For the conjunctive
and disjunctive models, the log transformed variables were fitted by
means of the regression technique. After these weights were obtained,
they were applied to the new set of data in order to obtain a predicted
ranking on the new sample. Since there were two separate samples on
which to obtain weights, a double cross-validation procedure was used,
i.e., the weights from each sample were applied to the other sample in
order to obtain a predicted ranking. Two estimates were thus obtained
of the goodness-of-fit for the particular weights that were obtained on
each of the original samples.
Since we were dealing with log transformed variables, the original scale
of the ranks is of considerable importance. Thus, if one chose to rank the
15 stimulus objects from 100 to 115 instead of from 1 to 15, the log transforms of the former would be quite different from the log transforms of the
latter. Since, for our purposes, it makes no difference whether the actual

<-----Page 7----->8

HYLLEL J. EINttORN

ranks are designated by 1 to 15 or some other set of numbers (the scale is
purely arbitrary), the actual results should be independent of the choice
of the original ranking scale. For the linear model, the use of different
scales will have no effect on the correlation since the linear correlation is
invariant over a linear transformation. However, when the variables are
transformed by logarithms, the choice of original scale will seriously
affect the correlation. In this study, ranks from 1 to 15 were used, with 1
representing the highest rank. If the log of the ranks is correlated with
the weighted sum of the logs of the attributes, the relationship will be
curvilinear (although monotonic). This occurs because successive differenees between the logs of the numbers 1 to 15 as one goes from 1 to 15 decreases, i.e., the slope of the log function is decreasing so that the smallest
differences are between 14 and 15 and the largest differences are between
1 and 2. This distortion of the scale causes the weighted sum of the attributes to be a curvilinear function of the log of the ranks, with a subsequent lowering of the linear correlation, even if the actual ranks were
a linear function of the weighted attributes.
In order to control for this effect, the predicted rankings were themselves ranked and this ranking was compared with the actual ranking by
means of Spearman's rho. This procedure yields a rectangular distribution
for both the actual and predicted rankings. Since the rank order correlation is invariant over a monotonic transformation (such as the log transformation), this circumvents the problem of the particular scale one
chooses for the ranks when they are transformed into the log scale. The
Spearman rhos, therefore, indicate the degree of monotonic relationship
between the actual ranks and the rank order of the predicted ranks.
In order to make comparisons between the different models, the Spearman rho was also calculated for the linear model by ranking the predicted
ranks and correlating this with the actual ranks.
There are two other reasons for using the rank order correlation. The
first concerns the interpretability of the predicted ranks. For all models,
on double cross-validation, one can obtain ranks that have decimal values,
negative values, and positive values beyond the number of ranks used.
This happens because in the regression analysis, the rank scMe is treated
as an interval scale that is not bounded at either end. On cross-validation,
the predicted scores can take on impossible values. For this reason, the
rank of the predicted scores is preferred, since this yields an interpretable
ranking from each model that can be compared with the actual ranking.
The second reason for using the rank order correlation involves the
fact that the two variables being correlated will have the same distribution, i.e., rectangular. As Carroll (1961) has pointed out, the magnitude
of the correlation coefficient is affected by the disparity of the marginal

<-----Page 8----->NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS

9

distributions of the two variables. If these distributions are dissimilar the
maximum correlation is reduced so that the limits of the correlation coefficient are constrained. Carroll further distinguishes between latent and
manifest relationships between variables, the former being the true relationship between the variables, and the latter being the observed relationship. The latent relationship can be distorted by errors of scaling, errors
of scale-dependent selection, and errors of measurement. The use of Spearman's rho by resealing the predicted ranks to obtain a predicted ranking
for each model would be a way to avoid an error of scaling. As Carroll
has stated, "It seems reasonable to assert that the kinds of adjustments
that are to be made to estimate the degree of latent relationship must be
selected in the light of the investigator's analysis of what kinds of errors
are to be adjusted for [p. 357]."
RESULTS: JOB PREFERENCE STUDY
Table 1 presents the validities obtained on double cross-validation for
each subject for each of the models and for both data sets. Since there
were two separate sets and three models, six rank order correlations were
obtained for each person. Each correlation is a Spearman rank order
correlation representing the degree of relationship between the predicted
and actual ranks.
In order to assess whether the linear or nonlinear models provided a
better fit for the data, several statistical tests were conducted. The first
two tests compared only the linear and conjunctive models, since the
disjunctive model yielded generally low correlations in all information
conditions. The first analysis consisted of a sign test for the direction of
differences obtained for the linear and conjunctive models. It was thought
that the direction of the differences over a large number of eases might
be interpreted as showing the superiority of one model over the other.
A z = 4.3 (p < .0001) was obtained for the first sample, reflecting the fact
that the conjunctive model was higher than the linear in 32 of the 37
cases. For the second sample the results showed a z = 3.6, which is also
significant at p < .0001 (conjunctive higher in 29 of 36 cases).
The second analysis consisted of comparing the two models in terms
of the proportion of statistically significant correlations (at p < .05) that
were obtained for each of the two double cross-validated samples. The
Spearman rho needed for significance at the .05 level for N = 15, is r~
.55. The proportion of significant correlations for the coniunctive model
was 66/78, while for the linear model it was 58/78. A z test for correlated
proportions indicated that the proportion of significant correlations obtained by using the coniunctive model was significantly higher than the
proportion obtained by using the linear model (z = 2.21, p < .05),

The third analysis consisted of a t h r e e - w a y analysis of variance (3 X
3 X 2) with repeated measures on the l a s t two factors. T h e three factors
were: (A) Amount of information (three levels--two, four, or six pieces
of information); (B) Models (three levels--linear, conjunctive, or disjunctive); (C) Samples (two levels--weights from sample 1 applied to
sample 2 or vice versa). Factors B and C were repeated since every subject received every model and sample. The dependent variable in the
analysis was the correlation between the actual and predicted ranks.
These correlations were first transformed to Fisher's z so t h a t the actual
dependent variable was the transformed correlation. The s u m m a r y table
for the analysis is presented in T a b l e 2.

The three main effects for A, B, and C are all significant. In addition,
there are two significant interactions, A X C and B X C. In order to. examine these effects more carefully, the cell means for all combinations of
the factors are given in T a b l e 3.
For the first main effect, the difference between the two-piece vs the
four- and six-piece condition accounts for the significant F ratio. F o r the

large differences between the samples in the A1 condition (two pieces of
information), but these differences are much smaller in the four- and sixpiece conditions. The B X C interaction (models-by-samples) shows that
there are large differences between the samples for all but the disjunctive
model. For this model the difference between the samples is very small.
The data presented thus far are concerned with the effects of the various
independent variables over the entire group of subjects. Since individual
analyses are deemed essential in this type of study, tIotelling's t test for
correlated correlations was performed for each subject. This test is used
to test for the significance of the difference between correlations of a criterion with each of two other variables when both of the variables are
themselves correlated. The criterion was the actual ranking obtained
from each subject, while the two variables were the predictions derived
from the two different models. The results for the t tests are given in
Table 4,
The "t" value for rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference between
the models was set at 1.782, which yields a p < .10 for a two-tailed test.
The reason for setting the alpha level at .10 was to increase the power
of the test to detect differences between the models. Using this analysis,
16 significant differences favored the coniunctive model, while the linear
was higher than the conjunctive in five cases. The remainder of the tests
were not significant. These results point to the value of using individual
analyses, since the previous results could be misinterpreted to imply that
all subjects used a conjunctive model. Subjects 3, 24, 29, and 35 all seem
to be using a linear model, although this is lost in the group analyses. AIthough only 21 of the 78 analyses proved to be significant, the direction of
the tests is consistently in favor of the conjunctive model (as would be
expected by the results of the previously described sign test).

The final analysis concerns the ratings of difficulty of the task. The
mean ratings of difficulty showed that the task was perceived as more
difficult as the amount of information was increased. For the two-, four-,
and six-piece conditions, the mean ratings were 3.31, 3.54, and 3.92,
respectively.
DISCUSSION:

JOB PREFERENCE

STUDY

One of the most striking findings of this study concerns the extremely
high correlations obtained on double cross-validation for the three models
dealt with. Examination of Table 1, as well as Table 3, shows that these
models are predictive to a high degree. This would indicate that the
mathematical model approach can provide a reasonably accurate and
efficient method for the study of human judgmental processes. Correlations of such magnitude are at least presumptive evidence concerning the
cognitive models these subjects were using for processing information.
In comparing the linear and nonlinear models, the disiunetive model
was not included in all the analyses. The reason for this was that the disjunctive model did not consistently provide high correlations and was
therefore not adequate for representing the nonlinear models in a comparison with the linear model. IIowever, the disiunctive model was included in the overall analysis of variance, where it yielded significantly
poorer predictions than the other two models. The mean correlation for
the disjunctive model was .53, which is not significant at the .05 level. For
the individual analyses it should be further noted that in cases where the
disjunctive model did provide a good fit to the data, the linear model
correlated higher with the actual rankings, so that inclusion of the disjunetive model would not have changed the results or their implications.
The results for all the tests, individual as well as group, point to the
superiority of the conjunctive model in this task. One might ask why
people in general (although not all) seem to use a conjunctive model
rather than a linear model in this task. Choosing a iob may be more likely
to produce a conjunctive solution, since one may have certain minimum
standards on the number of attributes, less than which one is unwilling to
accept. Furthermore, the cost of a false positive in this situation would
be expected to be high, i.e., choosing a job that turns out poorly would
involve a high cost to the decision maker. This aspect of the decision task
might lead to greater use of the conjunctive model. The poor showing of
the disiunetive model can probably also be attributed to the kind of task
used, since it would seem unlikely that having a great deal of one attribute
would be enough, by itself, to give a job a very high utility. In comparing
the linear and conjunctive models, it appears that compensation for lack

<-----Page 14----->NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS

15

of an attribute by having an over-abundance of another is not perceived
as having as much utility as having at least a certain minimum level on
each of the attributes. In fact, when subjects were asked to write any
strategy they were consciously aware of, many of them expressed the idea
of trying to find a "balance" between the attributes. For example, a
rating of 5-5 for two attributes was seen as preferable to a rating of 7-3.
Although both sum to 10, the product of the first term is higher and is
consistent with the use of a conjunctive model.
These results also bear on the controversy involving the use of interactions and configurations vs the use of main effects in clinical judgment.
The present results suggest that the use of interactions and complex configurations is widespread in the judgmental process. The relative superiority" of the conjunctive model in each information condition involved the
largest interaction term possible, i.e., if each of the attributes was considered a factor in predicting the judgments, an interaction would be expressed as a multiplieative function of the attributes. For the two-, four-,
and six-piece conditions, the conjunctive formulation used the two-, four-,
and six-way interaction, respectively. The unique feature of the present
formulation was the relative weighting of each of the attributes making
up the interaction. Since both the linear and conjunctive models used the
same number of parameters in order to obtain the original best fit, and
since the weighting of the interaction term produced the better fit for the
obtained data, it is at least some evidence for the clinician's claims that
something other than a linear model is being used. Again, the results here
are specific to this task. However, if nonlinear, noncompensatory models
are being used in the types of tasks clinicians are engaged in (and there is
no reason not to think so), then this result may be applicable to their
activities.
This study was also eoncenaed with the effects of varying amounts of
information on decision making. The results dearly show that the highest
double cross-validities occurred in the two-piece information condition,
while there was no significant difference between the four- and six-piece
conditions. Furthermore, the ratings of difficulty showed that the subjects
did, on the average, perceive the task to be more difficult as the amount
of information was increased. However, the ratings of difficulty were presented on a six-point scale, so that ratings of 3 and 4 represent ratings of
"slightly easy" and "slightly difficult." Thus, although an attempt was
made to make the task progressively more difficult, especially in the sixpiece condition, the subjects still were able to perform the task with relative ease. Even the six-piece condition produced a rating of 3.94, which is
slightly below the rating "slightly difficult." Whether these ratings reflee.t

<-----Page 15----->16

H I L L E L J . EINI-IOltN

what the subject perceives after he has simplified the situation, or
whether the situation is initially easy, is difficult to answer, since either
interpretation is possible.
The results for "amount of information" poin~ to the fact that one gets
a better fit for the mathematically simpler models when the amount of
information is less. The reasons for this result lie in two possible alternative explanations. The first alternative is that subjects are responding
randomly or with more error in the higher information conditions. Some
evidence against this interpretation, however, comes from three sources:
(1) When subjects were asked if they found themselves responding randomly in completing the task, none answered affirmatively; (2) The
ratings of the difficulty of the task would also indicate that the subjects
did not perceive the task to be so difficult that they would be responding
randomly; (3) Evidence of nonrandom responding comes from the deseriptions of the strategies the subjects said they were using. Some of
these descriptions showed that the subjects were using complex models
that were combinations of the various models proposed here.
The second alternative explanation concerns the use of complex or compound models in the greater-information conditions. As has been pointed
out, a model's mathematical complexity has little to do with the cognitive
difficulty in using it. The chief evidence for the use of complex models
comes from the descriptions that the subjects gave of the strategies they
said they were using. Some of these strategies involved sequential use of
the different models for different subsets of the experimental stimuli. If
more complex or compound models are being used, this would tend to lower
the correlations obtained by fitting the simplified models proposed here.
If people tend to simplify the situation as the amount of information is
increased (as most researchers believe), then the use of these complex
models would be seen as a method for cognitive simplification. The lower
correlations in th~ four- and six-piece information condition might therefore be explained by the use of these more complex models. It may be that
subjects find it easier to use these models as compared to the linear model
in the higher-information conditions. Furthermore, the use of complex
models for cognitive simplification would imply an interaction between
amount of information and complexity of the models used.
It was hypothesized that in an information overload condition, the
individual would simplify the situation so as to handle all the relevant
information. It was further hypothesized that one way of doing this was
to use the nonlinear, noncompensatory models. Examination of Table 2
shows that the A X B interaction (information-by-models) in the analysis
of variance is no~ significant. The relative superiority of the coniunctive
model was evident in all information conditions. It would seem therefore,

<-----Page 16----->NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS

17

that the model a person uses (in terms of the pure models dealt with here)
is more a reflection of the decision maker's underlying utility assumptions
about the attributes and the manner in which they combine than as an
information processing mechanism for simplification.
Another way for the decision maker to simplify the situation is to
ignore some variables completely and focus on only a few variables. The
ratings of importance for each subject for each attribute were collected
and analyzed. Unfortunately, there was no consistent pattern of use for
any particular variable. For some subjects in the four- and six-piece conditions, certain variables were ignored, but most subjects indicated that
they were using most of the attributes presented to them. If their verbal
report is accurate, this would tend to increase the likelihood that the use
of more complex models would be the characteristic method for cognitive
simplification.
The third finding concerns the significant effect for the different samples
used in the double cross-validation. One possible explanation for these
differences might lie in the differences in the correlations between the
attributes in the two different samples. Dudycha and Naylor (1966b),
for example, have found that the cue R matrix very definitely affects the
weighting of the various attributes. However, it is not clear whether one
should expect differences in accuracy of prediction if the correlations are
obtained by double cross-validation.
Another explanation for the sample differences is that on the second
set of data, it is possible that the subiect has finalized any strategy he
may have used or developed on the first set of data. He is more consistent
in his strategy and is less likely to deviate from it. If this were the case,
the actual rankings on the second set would be more consistent with
whatever model is being used, and therefore the correlations with these
rankings as the criterion should be higher. In support of this explanation,
some subjects, when asked to indicate if they paid less time to the second
set, replied that it took them less time since they had "practice" on the
first set. Furthermore, data from the second study, where decision makers
were familiar with the type of decision task, did not show this samples
effect. This suggests that familiarity with the decision task will play a
part in the decision strategy, and that results using experienced decision
makers may be different from those obtained using inexeperienced decision
makers.
The final results have to do with the two significant interactions. The
interaction between samples and information (A X C) showed large differences between the samples at A1 (two-piece condition), but not for the
other two-information conditions. This interaction can be explained in
terms of the "solidifying" explanation offered for the samples effect. In

<-----Page 17----->18

/:tlLLEL J. E[NI-IORN

the two-piece condition, the relative improvement or solidifying of a
strategy should be expected to take place faster than in the four- and sixpiece condition since there is less information to handle. In addition, there
is less likelihood of having to work out complex models in the two-piece
condition. The interaction shows that "improvement" is greatest in the
two as opposed to the four- and six-piece conditions, although there is
some improvement in all conditions (as indicated by the main effect for
samples).
The second interaction, B X C, showed that there was less difference
in the correlations between samples for the disjunctive model than for the
other two models. The fact that the disjunctive model was generally not
predictive here suggests that the correlations obtained for this model were
essentially random. The fact that there was little "improvement" for the
disjunctive model as compared to the other models for ~he different
samples can be explained by these essentially zero correlations.

Table 5 presents the validities obtained on double cross-validation.
In contrast to the results for the job preference study, the disjuneeive
model did provide for a good fit to these data. For this reason, the linear
model was here compared with the highest correlation obtained from the
fit of the nonlinear models, i.e., the linear was compared with either the
conjunctive or disjunctive model, depending on which one provided for
the best nonlinear fit of the data.
A sign test was first used to compare the linear and nonlinear models.
The results showed that for the first data set, the nonlinear models had
higher correlations than the linear model in 18 of 28 eases. The obtained
z = 1.3 was not significant at the .05 level. The results for the second
double cross-validated sample showed that the linear model had higher
correlations than the nonlinear models in 16 of 28 eases. The obtained
z = - - . 9 3 7 was not significant. These results show that there was no
systematic use of either a linear or nonlinear model in this task.
In order to further verify these results, the linear model was compared
with the conjunctive model in terms of the proportion of statistically
significant correlations obtained under each model. The obtained z = .667
was not significant (linear had 51/60 while the conjunctive had 48/60).
The third analysis was a 3 X 3 )< 2 analysis of variance, which was
exactly the same as that used in the job preference study. The summary
table for ~his analysis is presented in Table 6.
Examination of the table shows that the A effect (amount of information) and the B effect (models) were both significant at the .01 level. In
addition, there were two significant interactions, A ;K C and A X B. Table

cases this model was used in comparison with the linear model. The results of these tests are shown in Table 8.

significantly higher with the actual judgments in 11 cases, while the nonlinear models correlated significantly higher in 12 cases. The level of significance used was .10, two-tailed.
The final results concern the ratings of importance and the difficulty
of the task. These ratings show that the task was perceived to be more
difficult as the number of pieces of information was increased. The mean
ratings of difficulty for the two-, four-, and six-piece conditions were
4.0, 5.0, and 5.2, respectively. In addition, the average ratings of difficulty for this task over all information conditions were significantly
higher than those for the job preference study (t = 4.07, p < .01).
DISCUSSION: GRADUATE SELECTION STUDY
In terms of the use of the various models, it can be seen that there was
considerable diversity for these subjects. The group analyses all showed
that no one model was consistently used by a majority of the subjects.
Neither the sign test nor the comparison of the proportion of significant
correlations for the different models was significant. Furthermore, there
was greater use of the disjunctive model here than in the first study.
The group analysis that is of most interest is the three-way analysis of
variance. The effect for the amount of information shows that as subjects
are presented with .more information, the models are generally less accurate in terms of describing the subjects' actual decisions. As has already
been stated with respect to the job preference study, these lower correlations have been attributed to the use of complex combinations of models
in these higher-information conditions, although the alternative hypothesis of more error in the subjects' responses has not been fully eliminated.
The lack of an overall difference between the linear and conjunctive
model in this task points to the possible lack of constraint that this task
imposes on the decision strategy. This may be the result of the more
personal nature of the lob preference task as compared with selecting
graduate students. The high cost of a false positive in the former ease
might be more likely to result in the use of a conjunctive model as compared with the latter problem.
The lack of a main effect for "samples" suggests the relative expertise
and practice that these subjects bring to the situation as compared to the
relative inexperience with the task for the subjects in the lob preference
study. In terms of the "solidifying" explanation offered for the job preferenee results, the lack of such an effect would be expected for subjects who
have had experience with the task. This lack of a "samples" effect for the
more experienced decision makers further strengthens the "solidifying"
explanation offered for the iob preference results.

The interaction between information and samples (A X C) might be
explained in terms of a fatigue effect that causes greaser use of the complex models in order to simplify on the second sample. The ratings of
the difficulty of the task indicates that this task was perceived as a difficult one by most of the subjects. The six-piece condition was rated
"moderately difficult," indicating that it may have been an information
overload condition. The interaction shows that for the six-piece condition
only, the second sample yielded lower correlations than the first sample
over all models. If this condition was an overload one, the responses of
the subjects on the second sample may have been determined to a greater
extent by models employing cognitive simplification.
The second interaction concerns the models-by-information (A X B)
effect. It was hypothesized that there would be increased use of the nonlinear, noncompensatory models as the amount of information was increased. This was not supported. The interaction occurs because of the
especially poor fit of the disjunctive model in the six-piece condition. This
poor fit is probably due to the fact that when many variables are available, the disjunctive model is less likely to be used, since this would mean
a greater likelihood of ignoring other variables. In other words, the more
variables there are to consider, the less likely it is that one would want
someone who is extremely high on only one of the variables. If there are
fewer variables to deal with, one can use a disjunctive model with less
chance of ignoring some attribute.
Although the disjunctive model does poorly in the group analyses, the
individual analyses do show t h a t some subjects were using a disjunctive
strategy. In one ease, the verbal statement made by one such subject
indicated that she would rather select someone who was high on s o m e
attribute rather than someone who had less ability on many attributes.
The overall results for the indivdual analyses showed that the nonlinear
models did better than the linear in about half of the cases where significant differences were obtained. Again, the importance of the individual
analyses is indicated, since the group tests showed no differences in the
use of the linear vs the nonlinear models on the a v e r a g e .
CONCLUSIONS A•D IMPLICATIONS
The present results can be summarized as follows:
1. Relatively high correlations obtained for both studies under all conditions were indicative of the general usefulness of the models developed
for studying the underlying cognitive proeesses involved in decision
making.
2. There was considerable .use of the nonlinear, noneompensatory

<-----Page 23----->24

models, as well as the linear model. This result is directly contrary to
most of the research in this area. The use of the conjunctive model was
especially prevalent, while the use of the disjunctive model was considerably less.
3. The effect of the task on the use of the models is considerable. In the
job preference study, the conjunctive model was used by most of the subjects, while there was practically no disjunctive use. The results for all
the group tests showed the superiority of the conjunctive model in this
task (although there were still some linear model users). The graduate
selection study showed no one model to be used consistently by the subjects. In this task, the linear and conjunctive models fit the data equally
well, with the disjunctive model being used by a few subjects. Factors
such as the familiarity of the decision maker with the task, costs of false
positives, and personal involvement in the task were discussed as possible
factors in the use of the various models.
4. The results for "amount of information" showed that the goodnessof-fit of the models proposed here decreases as one has more information
on which to base his decisions. On the basis of supplementary data, this
result was interpreted as indicating that subjects in the greater information conditions were using more complex combinations of models. Although a complete content analysis of the subjects' answers to the question "What strategy did you use?" is beyond the scope of this study, a
cursory examination of these responses indicated that many subjects were
using complex models which involved combinations of models. This especially took the form of sequentially using one model for the first few
rankings, and then changing to another for the remaining stimuli. These
complex models would, of course, lower the correlation obtained by the
use of the simplified models we have proposed. The use of these complex
models was suggested as a possible way for the decision maker to simplify the situation, and it was pointed out that a model's mathematical
simplicity may have little to do with the cognitive difficulty in using it.
5. Although it was originally hypothesized that the use of the nonlinear,
noncompensatory models would increase as the amount of information
increased, this was not found in either study. This lack of a model-byinformation interaction was interpreted to mean that the use of these
various models is a reflection of the decision maker's utility scale for the
attributes and the method in which they combine and not a cognitive
mechanism for simplification. However, if the complex models explanation
is correct, then the results ~mply a complex models by-information interaction. Additional support for this argument comes from the fact that the
linear model showed no effect as a function of the amount of information.
If, as Goldberg (1968) and others have suggested, the linear model is 'a

<-----Page 24----->NONLINEAR, NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS

25

simple model, then one might expect greater use of this model as the
amount of information was increased. This did not occur in either study,
thereby leading to serious questioning as to whether the linear model is
cognitively a simple model to use. The results for the job preference
study in particular, point to the general use of the conjunctive model
regardless of the information condition.
6. The notion that the clinical decision maker uses interactions and
configurations rather than an additive model in his judgmental decision
making is given some support. The use of multiplicative rather than linear
:models suggests that judges may be using patterns and interactions in
combining information in decision making.

Implications ]or Future Research
Probably the most important question to be raised with regard to the
present research concerns the use of complex models in cognitive simplification. It is certainly an intriguing idea that more complex models will
have to be developed in order to deal with how cognitive simplification
works. In addition, more work will be needed to express complex models
mathematically as well as to deal with the more difficult problem of
sequential decision strategies.
A second aspect for future research concerns the possibility that some
subiects may simply ignore attributes in reaching an overall decision.
This would certainly be a simplification mechanism that would seem to
be ,quite easy to use. More objective ,methods will have to be developed
for determining what variables are being used in the decision strategy.
The major obstacle to be overcome will be to determine which variables
are being used when the variables are themselves correlated.
Finally, the models developed here might be fruitfully applied in other
areas of interest to psychologists. Such areas as attitude formation, impression formation, clinical diagnosis, etc., might benefit from applying
these nonlinear models to problems involving the combining of information. 0n]y by applying these models in other areas will we know their
generality for explaining methods whereby people combine multidimensional stimuli.
