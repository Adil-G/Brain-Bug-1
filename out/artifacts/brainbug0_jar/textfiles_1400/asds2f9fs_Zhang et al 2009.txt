Extending previous research on the genetic underpinnings of entrepreneurship, we investigate gender
differences in the genetic inﬂuences on the tendency of people to become entrepreneurs. We also examined two mediating variables through which genetic factors may impact this tendency: extraversion and
neuroticism. Based on 1285 pairs of identical twins (449 male and 836 female pairs) and 849 pairs of
same-sex fraternal twins (283 male and 566 female pairs), we found that females have a strong genetic
inﬂuence and zero shared-environmental inﬂuences on their tendency to become entrepreneurs. In contrast, males show zero genetic inﬂuence, but a large shared-environmental inﬂuence. Extraversion and
neuroticism mediate the genetic inﬂuences on women’s tendency to become entrepreneurs, whereas
extraversion mediates shared-environmental inﬂuences on men’s tendency to become entrepreneurs.
We discuss this sharp difference in genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship across gender groups and
highlight the different challenges that men and women face in their entrepreneurial endeavors.

Researchers have started to use behavioral genetics methods to
investigate phenomena in the world of business in the last several
decades (Ilies, Arvey, & Bouchard, 2006). For example, various constructs related to organizational behavior have been shown to have
a genetic component including job attitudes (e.g., Arvey, Bouchard,
Segal, & Abraham, 1989; Arvey, McCall, Bouchard, Taubman, & Cavanaugh, 1994), vocational interests (e.g., Lykken, Bouchard, McGue,
& Tellegen, 1993), work values (e.g., Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal,
& Dawes, 1992), and leadership (e.g., Arvey, Zhang, Avolio, & Krueger, 2007). Recently, Nicolaou and colleagues (Nicolaou & Shane,
2009; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, & Spector, 2008; Nicolaou,
Shane, Cherkas, & Spector, 2008) have conceptually argued, and
have provided empirical evidence for a genetic underpinning of
entrepreneurship.
Based on a large sample of identical and fraternal twins from
the United Kingdom, Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin et al.
(2008) found a high degree of heritability associated with entrepreneurial behaviors. Heritability is the proportion of variance in
a variable attributable to genetic factors (Loehlin, 1992). Nicolaou
and his colleagues reported that around 37–42% of the variance

in entrepreneurship could be accounted for by genetic factors,
whereas non-shared-environmental factors (i.e., the unique environment that people experience, despite growing up in the same
family) accounted for the remaining variance. Shared-environmental effects (i.e., the extent to which growing up in the same family
makes people similar) failed to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence individuals’
tendency to become entrepreneurs. Based on the same sample,
Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, and Spector (2008) found that sensation-seeking served as a partial mediator of the genetic inﬂuence
on entrepreneurship. Results such as these provide support for
the critical role played by biology and individual differences in
explaining the entrepreneurship process (Shane, 2003; White,
Thornhill, & Hampson, 2006, 2007).
Several important questions emerge in Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin et al.’s (2008), Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, & Spector’s
(2008) studies that merit further investigation. First, Nicolaou
and colleagues used a twin sample that consisted of predominantly
females (i.e., about 93% of the twins were female). Thus the results
of their research may be limited in terms of the generalizability of
their ﬁndings to male samples. Researchers have long argued that
women and men face different environments in various stages of
the entrepreneurship processes (e.g., Brush, 1992; Jennings &
McDougald, 2007; Langowitz & Minniti, 2007). If the environment

<-----Page 1----->94

provides different levels of resources, opportunities, and support
for women versus men, it is then possible that there may be gender
differences in the environmental effects on entrepreneurship for
males versus females.
Since the behavioral genetics model differentiates genetic and
environmental effects when accounting for the variance of observed variables (Loehlin, 1992), estimating separate models for
women versus men could uncover any differences in environment
and heritability estimates of entrepreneurship across gender. Such
differences would not be without precedent. Past research has
shown large gender differences in the genetic inﬂuences on life
events, social relationships, and delinquent behaviors (e.g., Eley,
Lichtenstein, & Stevenson, 1999; Lichtenstein & Pedersen, 1995;
Saudino, Pedersen, Lichtenstein, McClearn, & Plomin, 1997). As
such, the need exists to examine potential gender differences in
the genetic underpinnings of entrepreneurship.
A second and, we believe more interesting question concerns
the role that personality characteristics play in the relationship between genetics and the tendency of individuals to become entrepreneurs. Various personality variables that have been found to
predict entrepreneurship also have genetic underpinnings. For
example, extraversion represents the tendency to be outgoing,
assertive, active, and excitement-seeking. Extraversion has been
shown to be positively associated with whether an individual becomes an entrepreneur (e.g., Babb & Babb, 1992; Roberts, 1991).
Moreover, there is strong evidence supporting the genetic underpinnings of extraversion (e.g., Eaves, Eysenck, & Martin, 1989;
Loehlin, 1992; Loehlin, McCrae, Costa, & John, 1998). Thus, as suggested by Nicolaou and Shane (2009), we believe it is important to
investigate whether any genetic effects on entrepreneurship function through (or are mediated by) an individual’s level of
extraversion.
Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas and Spector (2008) have provided
some initial support for examining whether extraversion might
operate as a mediator by reporting that women’s sensation-seeking (a facet of extraversion) partially mediated the effect of genetics on their entrepreneurship. The identiﬁcation of such
personality mediators is useful because it helps to explain the
underlying mechanisms through which genetics and environmental factors impact entrepreneurship by identifying the various
sources of variation that contribute to the propensity of people
to become entrepreneurs.
The current study attempts to address these two questions
using a large sample of female and male twins drawn from the
Swedish Twin Registry (see Pedersen, Lichtenstein, & Svedberg,
2002). Drawing upon the literature on gender differences in entrepreneurship, the gene-environment interactions literature, and
discussions of gender differences in behavioral genetics literature,
we propose and test three hypotheses that focus on explicating
how gender, personality, and genetic factors relate to the emergence of entrepreneurs. More speciﬁcally, in the current paper
we examine the mediating role played by two personality variables
(extraversion and neuroticism) with respect to the genetic effects
on entrepreneurship comparing male and female twins.
This study expands on previous work in this domain (e.g., Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al., 2008; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, & Spector, 2008) and contributes to the entrepreneurship
literature in three ways. First, we investigate how gender relates
to the inﬂuences of personality and genetic factors on the emergence of entrepreneurs. Second, we explore how shared-environmental factors, or the lack thereof, as compared with genetic
factors, contribute to the propensity of people to become entrepreneurs. Prior literature has not differentiated genetic transmission
from family-related factors in explaining how entrepreneurs
emerge. For example, researchers have studied the effects of parents’ role modeling and transferring of social and ﬁnancial capital

on children’s entrepreneurship propensity (see Sorenson, 2007).
However, without explicitly modeling the genetic endowments
transmitted from parents, these family-related variables may not
represent pure environmental inﬂuences. Third, by looking into
the personality-based mechanisms through which genetics inﬂuence entrepreneurship, we can begin to unlock the ‘‘black box” of
genes (Ilies et al., 2006) and offer a more integrative understanding
of the individual-difference antecedents of entrepreneurship (e.g.,
genetics, personality, and gender) that have, to date, only been
examined in isolation. We begin below by exploring the role of
gender and personality in entrepreneurship, and developing
hypotheses regarding the moderating role of gender and the mediating role of personality in the genetic inﬂuences on
entrepreneurship.

Gender differences in the heritability of entrepreneurship
Gender differences in the prevalence of entrepreneurship have
been studied for decades. Numerous studies show that there is a
higher prevalence of entrepreneurship for men than that for women with similar backgrounds (e.g., Brush, 1992; Haber, Lamas,
& Lichtenstein, 1987). Additionally, this gender difference tends
to be robust across cultures and national boundaries. For example,
among Israeli working women, approximately 5.1% are self-employed-entrepreneurs, compared to 15% of Israeli working men
(Lerner, Brush, & Hisrich, 1997). Higher prevalence of men’s entrepreneurship was also found in Singapore (Kim & Ling, 2001). In the
US, women-owned businesses made up only 37% of all sole proprietorships in 1998 (Small Business Administration., 2001). This lower prevalence for women entrepreneurs in various countries
indicates a main effect of gender on the propensity of people to become entrepreneurs.
In explaining this gender difference in the prevalence of entrepreneurship, a large number of studies demonstrated that women
are to some extent discriminated against at various stages of entrepreneurship—a phenomenon also observed in large companies
when women managers are evaluated (e.g., Heilman, Block, & Lucas, 1992). Although one study found that once they become entrepreneurs, women may receive favorable perceptions from the
general population due to an attributional-augmenting effect (Baron, Markman, & Hirsa, 2001), the vast majority of research suggests
that women face more difﬁculties than their male counterparts in
the venturing process. In particular, compared with male entrepreneurs, women entrepreneurs are less likely to seek start-up capital
(Fay & Williams, 1993) and angel ﬁnancing (Becker-Blease & Sohl,
2007), have less ﬁnancial capital and human capital (i.e., education
and quantity of work experience) invested in their start-ups (Boden & Nucci, 2000; Carter, Williams, & Reynolds, 1997), have less access to business clients beyond their traditional household
clientele (Bates, 2002), and are asked for more collateral requirements or charged higher interest rates by loan ofﬁcers (Fraser,
2005; Riding & Swift, 1990). As a result, several large-scale studies
on multiple nations revealed that female entrepreneurs are less
successful in terms of objective success measures including lower
sales, slower growth, and lower proﬁts (Brush, Carter, Gatewood,
Greene, & Hart, 2006; Welter, Smallbone, & Isakova, 2006).
This increased level of difﬁculty for women entrepreneurs may
result from the generally-held gender stereotypes against women
entrepreneurs (Marlow & Patton, 2005). Research has shown that
an entrepreneurial career is typically associated with masculine
characteristics (Ahl, 2006; Buttner & Rosen, 1988; Lewis, 2006).
Several studies have demonstrated that these gender role stereotypes inﬂuence men’s and women’s intention to pursue an entrepreneurial career (Fagenson & Marcus, 1991; Gupta, Turban, &
Bhawe, 2008). These stereotypes may result in female entrepre-

neurs’ stronger self-imposed barriers to growth and less favorable
perceptions of themselves and the entrepreneurial environment, as
compared with male entrepreneurs (Langowitz & Minniti, 2007).
Consequently, many women entrepreneurs tend to use entrepreneurship as a means of balancing work and family, rather than
achieving ﬁnancial success (see Bird & Brush, 2002; Brush, 1992;
Kepler & Shane, 2007).
Given that the literature shows women entrepreneurs face
more environmental challenges and difﬁculties compared with
their male counterparts, we expect that the different venturing
environments can result in differential levels of genetic inﬂuences
on women’s and men’s tendency to become entrepreneurs. In the
following arguments, we draw upon the gene-environmental
interaction (G  E) literature, as well as literature exploring gender
difference in genetic inﬂuences to hypothesize different genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship across genders.
G  E interactions occur when environmental inﬂuences moderate genes’ effects on a phenotype or conversely, when the effect
of exposure to an environmental stimulus on a phenotype is conditional on a person’s genotype (Purcell, 2002). According to the
diathesis-stress model of G  E interactions (see Gottesman,
1991; Rende & Plomin, 1992), adverse environments can actually
foster greater genetic inﬂuences on a behavior of interest. For
example, in a supportive environment where everyone has enriched resources, individuals with various levels of genetic endowments towards entrepreneurship may have almost equal
probabilities of becoming entrepreneurs due to the abundance of
resources and lack of competition for them. Thus, genes should exert very small inﬂuences on entrepreneurship when environmental
resources are abundant. In contrast, individuals in less supportive
or depleted environments do not have that luxury, and would have
to rely more upon their genetic endowments to develop their business ideas, set up new ventures, and try to survive in a harsh environment. Thus, in this less supportive situation, genetic factors
may play a larger role in impacting people’s propensity to engage
in entrepreneurial activities.
Behavioral genetics studies on people’s positive and negative
life events and their social relationships provide support for the logic inherent in the above example. Speciﬁcally, researchers found
there is very little genetic inﬂuence on men’s desirable life events
but women show a substantial genetic inﬂuence on their life
events (e.g., major improvements in ﬁnancial status, making a
new acquaintance, etc.; Saudino et al., 1997). Greater genetic effects in negative life events such as interpersonal difﬁculties, legal
difﬁculties, and ﬁnancial difﬁculties were also found for women
compared with men, and the difference between the heritability
estimates for women versus men on these events were large (differences range from .20 to .49; see Bolinskey, Neale, Jacobson, Prescott, & Kendler, 2004).
The number of social relationships and perceived adequacy of
social support also have been shown to have a greater genetic
inﬂuence among women (Lichtenstein & Pedersen, 1995). In particular, for men the number of social relationships and their perceived adequacy of social support are both impacted by sharedenvironmental inﬂuences, rather than genetic factors (h2 = .00 for
both variables). In contrast, for women both measures are genetically inﬂuenced (h2 = .36 for number of relationships and h2 = .34
for perceived support; Lichtenstein & Pedersen, 1995). Because
successful entrepreneurship is a desirable life event that can result
from good social relationships and less interpersonal, legal, and
ﬁnancial difﬁculties, given the demonstrated gender differences
in genetic inﬂuences on life events and social relationships, we expect that women would have greater genetic inﬂuences on their
tendency to become entrepreneurs, as compared with men.
A second reason that we may expect higher genetic inﬂuences
on women’s entrepreneurship is based upon ﬁndings regarding dif-

95

ferential heritability concerning delinquency behaviors. Using two
large samples of adolescent twins, Eley et al. (1999) found higher
heritability for non-aggressive delinquent behavior among females
(h2 = .42) than for males (h2 = .13). With regard to factors inﬂuencing non-aggressive delinquent behaviors, their ﬁndings suggest
that genetic effects have a greater inﬂuence on females whereas
shared-environment plays a great role for males. Some researchers
argue that entrepreneurial activities can be associated with rule
breaking and/or deviating from generally accepted social norms
(e.g., Gould, 1969). It has been found that there is a longitudinal
relationship between adolescents’ rule-breaking behavior and
entrepreneurship in adult life (Zhang & Arvey, in press). Thus, it
seems plausible to expect a higher heritability of entrepreneurship
(as a form of deviating behavior) among females than among
males. Support for large heritability differences between genders
has also been found in studies that have shown that women have
higher heritability estimates on behaviors such as stress coping
styles (Kato & Pedersen, 2005) and severe DSM-IV major depressive disorder (with men showing zero genetic inﬂuence and women showing moderate genetic inﬂuence; see Bierut et al., 1999).
In sum, because women are likely to face a more challenging
environment for their entrepreneurial endeavors than men, it is
likely that gender could moderate the magnitude of genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship. The adversity that prospective female
entrepreneurs face could allow their genetic endowments to
strongly inﬂuence their entrepreneurship, and the more resource-abundant environment for men may minimize the potential effects of their genetic endowments on their entrepreneurial
activities. Thus, we hypothesize that any genetic inﬂuence on
entrepreneurship will be greater for women than for men.
Hypothesis 1. Compared with men, women will demonstrate a
higher level of genetic inﬂuence on their propensity to become
entrepreneurs.
The mediating role of extraversion and neuroticism
Meta-analytic studies have established that individual differences play a role in the tendencies of people to become entrepreneurs (e.g., Stewart & Roth, 2004; Zhao & Seibert, 2006). Various
personality characteristics that have been shown to be related to
entrepreneurship have also been linked to genetics. Thus, as White
and colleagues (2006, 2007) and Nicolaou and Shane (2009) contend, it makes sense to speculate that one of the mechanisms
through which genes inﬂuence entrepreneurship is individual personality characteristics. In particular, genes could predispose people to develop personality characteristics that affect their tendency
to engage in entrepreneurial activities.
In the current study, we focus on two dimensions in the ﬁvefactor model of personality—extraversion and neuroticism—due
to two primary reasons. First, research on the biological bases of
personality (i.e., brain functioning) has been centering on these
two personality variables. For example, Eysenck and colleagues
(Eysenck, 1967; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985) used multiple arousal
systems to study extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. In
Gray’s (1981, 1982) personality theory, behavioral inhibition and
activation were used to examine impulsivity and anxiety (which
correspond to extraversion and neuroticism, respectively). Overall,
among the dimensions of the ﬁve-factor model, extraversion and
neuroticism have received the strongest support in terms of their
association with the differential functioning of distinct neurobiological systems (for a review, see Matthews & Gilliland, 1999). Given the extensive research on the biological basis of these two
personality characteristics, we examine extraversion and neuroticism as potential mediators of the genetic inﬂuences on
entrepreneurship.

<-----Page 3----->96

By focusing on extraversion and neuroticism we are also able to
integrate two personality frameworks that have dominated the
personality literature: the ﬁve-factor model (Costa & McCrae,
1992) and positive affectivity–negative affectivity (PA-NA, Watson
& Clark, 1994; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). NA reﬂects tendencies to experience negative emotional states such as fear, hostility and anger; PA reﬂects tendencies to experience positive
states such as enthusiasm, conﬁdence and cheerfulness. By integrating these two frameworks, Brief (1998) contends that PA-NA
may be subsumed under the ﬁve-factor framework, with PA being
analogous to extraversion and NA to neuroticism. Consequently,
examining extraversion and neuroticism can help inform two
widely researched personality frameworks.
Extraversion refers to the tendency to be assertive, enjoy the
company of other people and large groups, and seek excitement
and stimulation (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Researchers have found
that extraversion is positively related to occupational interests in
terms of enterprising (Costa, McCrae, & Holland, 1984) and to the
exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (Baron, 2002). It
seems logical to expect that extraversion would be an important
personality characteristic for a successful entrepreneur since extraverted people tend to have more social skills, and are good at convincing others—an important skill for entrepreneurs when
persuading various stakeholders such as venture capitalists, bankers, and customers (Rauch & Frese, 2000; Shane, 2003).
Prior empirical studies have also reported a positive relationship between facets of extraversion and entrepreneurship (e.g.,
Baron & Markman, 2003; Brandstätter, 1997; Wooten, Timmerman, & Folger, 1999). For example, Babb and Babb (1992) surveyed ﬁrm founders and non-founders in various industries
and found that founders scored higher on sociability. Roberts
(1991) also found that people with ﬁrm-founding experience
were more extroverted than those who had not started a ﬁrm.
Based on a large sample from the British National Child Development Study, Burke, FitzRoy, and Nolan (2000) found that anxiety
acceptance (a measure of extraversion) assessed at the age of 11
was positively associated with entrepreneurial status and venture performance in adult life. In addition, using meta-analytically derived population correlations (based upon nine effect
sizes), Zhao and Seibert (2006, p.265) showed that the standardized regression coefﬁcient for extraversion is .09 (t = 3.88,
p < .05) when entrepreneurial status was regressed upon all the
big ﬁve personality variables.
The level of social skills has been used as a means of explaining
the observed relationship between extraversion and entrepreneurship. The importance of social/political skills in terms of achieving
certain job outcomes has been shown in conventional work settings (e.g., Blickle et al., 2008; Harris, Kacmar, Zivnuska, & Shaw,
2007; Liu et al., 2007). Prior research has also reported positive
associations between extraversion and the extent to which individuals engage in networking behaviors (e.g., Forret & Dougherty,
2001; Lee & Tsang, 2001). In addition, Totterdell, Holman, & Hukin,
2008 found that people’s level of extraversion was positively related to their propensity to connect with others which, in turn, is
related to the size of their friendship networks and their centrality
in the advice networks. Prospective entrepreneurs’ social networks
may provide more resources and information needed to discover
and exploit opportunities (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986; Busenitz,
1996; Johansson, 2000) and can lead to better venture performance
(Aldrich, Rosen, & Woodward, 1987; Bruderl & Preisendorfer, 1998;
Reynolds & White, 1997; Shane & Stuart, 2002). Given the importance of social skills and social networks in the venturing process,
these ﬁndings provide strong support for proposing a relationship
between extraversion and entrepreneurship.
Importantly, not only does extraversion relate to entrepreneurship, but extraversion has also been found to have a strong genetic

underpinning (Bouchard & Loehlin, 2001). Using meta-analytic
procedures to summarize quantitative genetic studies, Loehlin
(1992) showed that extraversion has a heritability of about .49.
Moreover, based on molecular genetic analyses, Benjamin et al.
(1996) identiﬁed the long alleles of the DRD4 exon III repeat gene
to be related to extraversion, providing a molecular biological basis
for the genetic inﬂuences on extraversion.
Based on the above literature, we hypothesize that the genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship are partially mediated by extraversion. Given the range of possible mediating mechanisms through
other channels (e.g., intelligence and other psychological characteristics), and because genes may have a direct effect on entrepreneurship through inﬂuencing chemical mechanisms in the brain to
increase the likelihood that people become entrepreneurs (Nicolaou & Shane, 2009), we expect a partial mediation role for
extraversion.
Hypothesis 2. Extraversion will partially mediate the genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.
Neuroticism refers to the tendency of people to be emotionally
unstable, and experience negative emotions such as depression,
impulsiveness, and vulnerability (Costa & McCrae, 1992). People
who are lower in neuroticism tend to be self-conﬁdent, calm, and
relaxed. Entrepreneurs have to take full responsibility (both ﬁnancially and personally) for their business and typically work in a dynamic and unstructured environment. Thus, they face high
pressures coming from all aspects of the venturing process, as well
as the potential for work-family conﬂicts. It is then reasonable that
individuals low in neuroticism would have a better chance of
becoming entrepreneurs because they are self-conﬁdent and persistent. Conversely, those high in neuroticism would be expected
to lack the conﬁdence and resilience required to address the pressures associated with entrepreneurship (e.g., Brandstätter, 1997;
Wooten et al., 1999). Zhao and Seibert’s meta-analysis (2006,
p.265) showed that the standardized regression coefﬁcient for neuroticism was .12 (t = 4.80, p < .05) when population correlations
among the ﬁve factors were used in regression analyses to predict
entrepreneurship.
The negative relationship between neuroticism and entrepreneurship can also be partially explained by the enhanced social
networks obtained by those low in neuroticism. Klein, Lim, Saltz,
and Mayer (2004) found that the level of neuroticism was a key
predictor of centrality in advice and friendship networks. In particular, people low in neuroticism tended to obtain central positions
in advice and friendship networks and people high in neuroticism
tended to become the center of adversarial networks. Because social networks are crucial to the success of potential entrepreneurs,
these results suggest that there could be a negative relationship
between neuroticism and entrepreneurship.
Similar to extraversion, neuroticism has been found to be
highly inﬂuenced by genetic factors. Researchers have reported
that neuroticism has a meta-analytic heritability estimate of
around .41 (Loehlin, 1992). A polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene
has been associated with neurotic characteristics (e.g., anxiety,
negative emotionality, hostility in unfamiliar situations; Lesch
et al., 1996). Given the genetic underpinnings of neuroticism
and the relationship between neuroticism and entrepreneurship,
we hypothesize that the genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship
will be partially mediated by neuroticism. Partial mediation is
hypothesized since there may exist direct relationships and other
mediating mechanisms linking genes and entrepreneurship, similar to our arguments above regarding extraversion (Nicolaou &
Shane, 2009).
Hypothesis 3. Neuroticism will partially mediate the genetic
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.

Method
Sample and procedures
The sample for the current study was drawn from the Swedish
Twin Registry (STR) that was established in the late 1950s (for details see Lichtenstein et al., 2002; Pedersen et al., 2002). In 2006,
twins in STR who were born in 1959–1985 completed a questionnaire on personality and work-related activities, including entrepreneurship. A total of 1285 pairs of identical (i.e., monozygotic
or MZ) twins and 849 pairs of same-sex fraternal (i.e., dizygotic
or DZ) twins provided complete data on personality and entrepreneurship measures. In the ﬁnal sample, 65.7% of the twins are female, all were white, and 40.2% were married. The average age of
the sample was 39.0 (SD = 6.5). The demographic characteristics
of these twins are comparable to those in other countries (e.g.,
Heath et al., 1997; Johnson & Krueger, 2005). With regard to education, 44.8% of the twins had ﬁnished high school and 40.3% of
them had associate degrees or college degrees.
Measures
Entrepreneurship
Previous research has employed a variety of operationalizations
of entrepreneurship (Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al.,
2008; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, & Spector, 2008). This study used
three indicators to measure this variable. Participants were asked:
(a) ‘‘Do you have a company or partly-own a company at the present time?” (1 = yes; 0 = no), (b) ‘‘Have you been mainly self-employed or part-owner in the past three years?” (1 = yes; 0 = no),
and (c) ‘‘Have you been an employer in the past three years?”
(1 = yes; 0 = no). These three indicators were highly correlated in
the current study (r’s > .91, p < .001). We used the average score
of the three items when we reported the correlations among study
variables. The coefﬁcient alpha was .87 for this three-item scale. In
our structural equation models (SEM), we used these three indicators to derive a composite measure (which is equivalent to an average score) representing a latent construct, i.e., the propensity of
people to become entrepreneurs. A similar latent construct approach has been used by other researchers who investigated the
biological basis of entrepreneurship (e.g., Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas,
Hunkin, et al., 2008; White et al., 2006).
Extraversion
Extraversion was measured using a 7-item scale drawn from
the abbreviated version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-A (EPQR-A; Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985; France, Brown,
& Philipchalk, 1992). Each item was scored 1 (= yes) or 0 (= no).
These items include: ‘‘Do you like plenty of bustle and excitement
around you?,” ‘‘do you almost always have an answer when spoken
to?,” ‘‘Do you prefer to keep in the background when you are in
company with other people?,” (reversed), ‘‘Do you regard yourself
as happy and carefree?,” ‘‘do you have a lively manner?,” ‘‘Do you
quickly describe your thoughts in words?,” and ‘‘Do you like to
crack jokes and tell funny stories to your friends?” The coefﬁcient
alpha was .67 for this scale. To examine the construct validity of
this scale, we conducted omnibus conﬁrmatory factor analyses
on all items (see below).
Neuroticism
Neuroticism was measured using a 7-item scale drawn from
EPQR-A with each item scored 1 (= yes) or 0 (= no). These items include: ‘‘Do you worry too much after an embarrassing experience?,” ‘‘Would you call yourself a nervous person?,” ‘‘are you a
worrier?,” ‘‘Do you often feel ‘fed-up’?,” ‘‘Do you often worry about

97

things you should not have done or said?,” ‘‘are your feelings easily
hurt?,” and ‘‘Are you easily hurt when people ﬁnd fault with you or
the work you do?” The coefﬁcient alpha was .78.
Discriminant validity for the self-reported measures was established through individual-level conﬁrmatory factor analyses to
verify the distinctiveness of the three constructs, i.e., extraversion,
neuroticism, and entrepreneurship. We used all items from the
three scales and compared the proposed three-factor measurement
model with three alternative two-factor models (combining two
measures out of the three) and an omnibus one-factor model.
Absolute ﬁt indexes for the proposed three-factor model were adequate, v2 (df = 68, N = 4268) = 941.26, p < .001, comparative ﬁt index (CFI = .95, TLI = .96, root-mean-square error of approximation
(RMSEA) = .06. These ﬁt indexes were superior to those found for
the two-factor models. For the two-factor models, v2 ranged from
2306.87 (df = 52) to 3964.71 (df = 50), CFI ranged from .76 to .84,
TLI ranged from .75 to .87, and RMSEA ranged from .10 to .14.
The omnibus one-factor model showed the poorest ﬁt, v2
(df = 51, N = 4268) = 5680.48, p < .001, CFI = .65, TLI = .65,
RMSEA = .16. In combination, these results indicate that our proposed three-factor model provided a better ﬁt to the data than
did the alternative models, suggesting the three scales represent
concepts that are theoretically and empirically distinct from each
other.

Zygosity
Zygosity was measured in the Swedish Twin Registry using
twins’ answers to the following questions: (a) during childhood,
whether you and your twin-partner were as alike as two peas in
a pod or not more alike than siblings in general (1 = two peas in
a pod, 0 = not more alike than siblings), (b) how often did strangers
have difﬁculty in distinguishing between you and your twin-partner when you were children? (1 = never, 2 = seldom, . . . , 5 = always). This method of zygosity determination has been shown to
correctly diagnose more than 95% of the twins in Sweden when
compared with blood test results (see Cederlof, Friberg, Jonsson,
& Kaij, 1961) and in other countries as well (see Sarna, Kaprio,
Sistonen, & Koskenvuo, 1978). This method was also validated
using 13 DNA markers based on 199 twin pairs from STR, and
proved to be correct in 99% of the twin pairs.

Gender
Twin’s gender was assessed based on self-report measures.

Control variables
Twin closeness
The closeness of the two twins of a pair can inﬂuence twin concordance on any variable of interest. Thus, it was important in the
current study to control for twin closeness when examining the
propensity of these twins to become entrepreneurs. We measured
twin closeness by asking each individual twin two questions. First,
they were asked to indicate how often they have contact with their
twin-partner either by telephone, e-mail, or letters (measured as
times per year). Second, they were asked how often they meet with
their twin-partner (measured as times per year). These two indicators were averaged to obtain a measure of twin closeness. The coefﬁcient alpha was .75 for this scale. To examine the within-pair
agreement on twin closeness, we calculated the intra-class correlation (ICC[1]; James, 1982) for this measure using the pair of twins
as the level-2 units and the two twins in that pair as level-1 units.
ICC(1) was .87, indicating a very high level of agreement between
the two twins in a pair.

Other control variables
In addition to twin closeness, marital status (1 = married,
0 = otherwise), education level (1 = compulsory school, 2 = upper
secondary school, 3 = high school, 4 = vocational school, 5 = military school, and 6 = university and above), and age (in years) were
used as control variables. These variables were controlled for because they may be related to the individual’s exposure to entrepreneurial opportunities and their decision to exploit these
opportunities (Shane, 2003).
Analysis
We modeled the propensity to engage in entrepreneurship as a
latent continuous variable, manifested by a composite measure of
the three entrepreneurship indicators. The Mplus program (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2007) was used to apply genetic model-ﬁtting
techniques. Following previous twins research involving ordered
categorical dependent variables (e.g., Johnson, McGue, Krueger, &
Bouchard, 2004) we used the asymptotically weighted least
squares estimator, which does not require normally distributed
data.
Univariate analysis on the heritability of entrepreneurship
In the univariate analysis, we used the classic quantitative genetic methodology to estimate the heritability of the tendency of
twins to become entrepreneurs. This method utilizes the difference
in genetic relatedness between MZ twins (who share all of their genetic material) and DZ twins (who share on average 50% of their
genes) to estimate the relative genetic and environmental contributions to the observed variance of a phenotype (in this case,
entrepreneurship). Based on behavioral genetics theory, greater
similarity between the two members of an MZ twin pair relative
to those in a DZ twin pair is indicative of additive genetic
contributions.
In the univariate analyses we used multi-group structural equation modeling. In both the MZ and the DZ groups, the variance of
the entrepreneurship variable was parsed into three components:
additive genetic variance, shared-environmental variance, and
non-shared-environmental variance (which also includes measurement error). Additive genetic effects (i.e., latent variable A) refer to the effects of the summation of genes across loci, while
shared (i.e., latent variable C) and non-shared (i.e., latent variable
E) environmental effects refer to environmental effects that contribute to twin similarities and differences, respectively. The three
latent variables (i.e., A, C, and E) are standardized variables, so that
their corresponding path coefﬁcients represent the strength of
their inﬂuences. Fig. 1 shows the path diagram for the univariate
model for one group in the multi-group SEM analysis. The path
coefﬁcients a, c, and e are held equal across the groups.
The structural relationships represented by Fig. 1 can be written
as the following structural equations (control variables not
shown):

Pij ¼ aAij þ cC ij þ eEij

ð1Þ

V p ¼ a2 þ c2 þ e2 ¼ 1

ð2Þ

where Pij is the measure of entrepreneurship of the ith individual in
the jth pair (i = 1, 2; j = 1, . . . , n), Aij, Cij, and Eij are standardized latent variables, and their coefﬁcients a, c, and e represent the
strength of the additive genetic inﬂuence, shared- environmental
inﬂuence, and non-shared-environmental inﬂuence, respectively.
Vp is the total variance of the entrepreneurship variable and is typically standardized as having a value of 1. Because A, C, and E are assumed to be independent from one another, Vp can be decomposed
to the additive genetic variance (a2), shared-environmental inﬂu-

ence (c2), and non-shared-environmental inﬂuence (e2). Heritability
is estimated as h2 = a2/Vp.
We estimated the heritability of entrepreneurship before and
after partialling out the control variables including age, marital status, education, and twin closeness. Previous behavioral genetics research has recommended similar approaches to control for
confounding factors (e.g., Hakim, Cherkas, Grahame, Spector, &
MacGregor, 2004; Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al., 2008).
Gender’s effect on the strength of genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship was examined by comparing the heritability of entrepreneurship for female versus male twins. A series of nested
models were estimated with increased sets of constraints on path
coefﬁcients in the MZ group and DZ group. These nested models
were compared based on various ﬁt indexes and the most parsimonious model was chosen to test our ﬁrst hypothesis.

Multivariate analysis for testing mediation
We ran multivariate genetic models to test the potential mediation effects of extraversion and neuroticism. Although mediation
can be examined using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) multi-step regression-based procedures, the multivariate genetic models can provide a holistic analysis including both mediators simultaneously.
In the multivariate models, the two personality variables and the
entrepreneurship variable are examined for their respective A, C,
E factors and the potential overlap among these factors. If the two
personality variables have genetic inﬂuences that overlap with
those on entrepreneurship, we can conclude that personality variables partially mediate the genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.
The multivariate models yield estimates of genetic and environmental contributions to variance in and covariance between the
two personality variables and the entrepreneurship variable.
Fig. 2 presents a general diagram of the multivariate models we
used in this study. For simplicity purposes, this graph only shows
the genetic paths. The path coefﬁcients in these models are stan-

dardized partial regression estimates. The effects of the genetic
(and environmental) inﬂuences on entrepreneurship are decomposed into those speciﬁc to entrepreneurship and those in common
with the two personality variables. In particular, the path a31 and
a32 represent the genetic inﬂuences that are in common with that
of extraversion and neuroticism, respectively. The path a33 represents the speciﬁc or unique genetic factors associated with entrepreneurship. While not shown in the graph, similar sets of paths
are estimated for the shared- and non-shared-environmental factors of the two personality variables and the entrepreneurship
variable.
This procedure for testing mediation using multivariate quantitative genetic methods approximates the preconditions that Mathieu and Taylor (2007) have identiﬁed as critical requirements for
mediation inferences: (a) true experimental design, (b) temporal
precedence, and (c) theoretical rationale. In particular, the use of
twins as study samples takes advantage of a kind of natural experiment where in one condition we have the exact same genetic
make-up (i.e., identical twins) and in another condition the makeup approximates 50% (i.e., fraternal twins). Because genes are exogenous to personality characteristics and entrepreneurial activities,
and because personality is formed early in life and remains relatively stable across the lifespan, we believe there is temporal precedence of genes and personality before entrepreneurship.

Results
Table 1 provides the comparison between MZ versus DZ twins
on the variables used in this study. There were no signiﬁcant differ-

ences in the prevalence of the three entrepreneurship indicators
between MZ and DZ twins. However, MZ and DZ twins showed
some differences with regards to their martial status (more DZ
twins are married; v2 = 13.24, p < .001), their age (DZ twins are
older; t = 10.4, p < .001), and twin closeness (MZ twins are closer
to their co-twins; t = 19.86, p < .001). These three variables might
act as confounds and thus need to be controlled when any genetic
inﬂuence on entrepreneurship was modeled.
Table 2 reports descriptive statistics and the Pearson product–
moment correlations (if both variables are continuous) and tetrachoric correlations (if either variable is categorical) for all of
the variables include in this study. All correlations were calculated
at the individual level. As shown in Table 2, extraversion (r = .09,
p < .001) and neuroticism (r = .06, p < .01) only moderately correlated with entrepreneurship, but these correlations were statistically signiﬁcant. There was also a signiﬁcant gender difference in
the prevalence of entrepreneurship, as evidenced by the correlation between gender (female = 1, male = 0) and entrepreneurship
(r = .21, p < .001). Age (r = .15, p < .001) and marital status
(r = .11, p < .001) were also positively correlated with
entrepreneurship.
In order to better present the data structure within the pairs of
twins, we provide the within-pair correlations of the two personality variables and the entrepreneurship variable. As shown in Table
3, there was a large difference between female MZ and DZ twins in
the within-pair correlation for entrepreneurship (r = .66 for MZ and
.30 for DZ). In contrast, the correlations were very similar for the
male MZ and DZ twins (r = .54 for MZ and .58 for DZ twins), indicating a rather small genetic inﬂuence on male twins’
entrepreneurship.

Hypothesis 1 states that females will demonstrate a greater genetic inﬂuence on entrepreneurship than males. Table 4 shows the
results based on univariate analysis before partialling out the inﬂuences of the control variables. Male and female samples were
examined as separate groups in the multi-group SEMs. In the full
model (Model 1, male ACE and female ACE model), A, C, and E factors are all included for both gender groups. This model produced a
very good ﬁt (CFI = 1.00 and RMSEA = .00). In this model, the heritability estimate of entrepreneurship for males was zero (with a
95% conﬁdence interval including zero), whereas the heritability
for females was .65 (p < .01, 95% CI = .32 to .98). We then tested a
nested model in which the genetic inﬂuences for males and females were constrained to equality (Model 2). This constrained
model showed a statistically signiﬁcant change in chi-square of
4.34 (p < .05, df = 1) and the heritability estimates were no longer
statistically signiﬁcant for both genders (point estimate is .25,
95% CI = .11 to .60). This shows the genetic inﬂuence on entrepreneurship was signiﬁcantly different for males versus females.
Another nested model was tested in which both gender groups
were speciﬁed to have A and E factors only (Model 3). This model
produced a signiﬁcantly worse ﬁt (Dv2 = 9.68, df = 2, p < .01,
CFI = .94, RMSEA = .05) in comparison with the full model. Finally,
we tested a reduced model where the A component for males and
the C component for females were constrained to be zero (Model
4). This model showed a non-signiﬁcant chi-squared change

(Dv2 = .01, df = 2) and satisfactory ﬁt indices. Consequently, this
male CE and female AE model (Model 4) was chosen as the most
parsimonious model to represent the data. Based on this model,
males showed no genetic effects on entrepreneurship, with a very
strong effect shown for shared-environmental factors (c = .57,
p < .001).
Table 5 provides highly similar results based on analyses after
partialling out the effects of the control variables. The constrained
model (Model 2), where AM equals AF, showed a signiﬁcant chisquare change and non-signiﬁcant heritability estimates (h2 = .28,
95% CI = .11 to .67). Model 3 also showed worse ﬁt and a signiﬁcant chi-square change. In the best-ﬁtting model (Model 4), where
the genetic factor for males and the shared-environmental factor
for females were ﬁxed to zero, the genetic inﬂuences were zero
for males and .60 (p < .001) for females. Comparing the results before and after partialling out the various control variables, we
found a slight decrease in the heritability estimate for females
(from .65 to .60). Based on these ﬁndings, Hypothesis 1 was
supported.
To ensure that we have convergent results, we also performed
univariate analyses on each of the three indicators of entrepreneurship both before and after controlling for the various confounding factors. These analyses produced very similar results for
each respective indicator. Consequently, we decided to report here
only the results for the composite entrepreneurship measure.

The best-ﬁtting model.

Hypothesis 2 and 3 suggest a mediating role for extraversion
and neuroticism in the genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship.
We conducted multivariate analyses for both males and females,
although we did not ﬁnd genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship
in the male twins using univariate models. Possible confounds
were also controlled for in the mediation analyses.
Table 6 shows the path coefﬁcient estimates and ﬁt indexes for
the full multivariate model and the best-ﬁtting nested models for
the female and the male group. For parsimony sake, we only report
the paths pointing to the entrepreneurship variable since the paths
linking the two personality variables are not the focus of the current investigation.
In the full multivariate model for females, the paths between
the shared-environmental factors of the two personality variables
and entrepreneurship (i.e., c31, c32, and c33) are very small in magnitude and not statistically signiﬁcant. After ﬁxing these paths and
the path between extraversion’s non-shared-environmental factor
and entrepreneurship (e31) to zero, we obtained the reduced model
that produced a better ﬁt (i.e., AIC dropped from 14.7 to 3.6,
RMSEA = .04 rather than .05) and a non-signiﬁcant change in v2.
Consequently, the reduced model was chosen for testing mediating
effects for the two personality variables. Fig. 3 shows the path coefﬁcient estimates for the reduced model for females.
Based on the reduced model in Table 6 and Fig. 3, extraversion
and neuroticism both show some overlap between their genetic
factors and that of entrepreneurship. The paths from the genetic
factors for these two variables onto entrepreneurship were significant (a31 = .09, p < .05, 95% CI = .03, .15, and a32 = .12, p < .05, 95%
CI = .19, .06). Thus, both extraversion and neuroticism partially

mediated the genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurship for women.
Hypothesis 2 and 3 are both supported for women only. The percentage of genetic variance that is mediated by the two personality
variables is calculated as the sum of the squared path coefﬁcients
for the two personality variables, divided by the sum of the
squared path coefﬁcients of all the genetic factors, i.e.,
(.092 + .122)/(.092 + .122 + .802) = 3.4%. It is notable that neuroticism also partially mediated the non-shared-environmental inﬂuence on entrepreneurship since the path e32 is statistically
signiﬁcant (.04, p < .05, 95% CI = .08, .01).
In the full multivariate model for males, the path coefﬁcients between the genetic factors of the two personality variables and entrepreneurship (i.e., a31, a32, and a33) were very
small in magnitude and not statistically signiﬁcant. After ﬁxing
these paths and the path between extraversion’s non-sharedenvironmental factor and entrepreneurship (e31), neuroticism’s
shared and non-shared-environmental factors to entrepreneurship (c32 and e32) to zero, we obtained the reduced model that
produced a better ﬁt (i.e., AIC dropped from 6.9 to .01,
RMSEA = .05 rather than .06) and a non-signiﬁcant change in
v2. Consequently, the reduced model was chosen for males.
Fig. 4 shows the path coefﬁcient estimates for the reduced
model for males. According to Fig. 4, extraversion partially
mediated the shared-environmental inﬂuence on entrepreneurship. In particular, the path from extraversion’s shared-environmental factor to entrepreneurship was signiﬁcant (c31 = .17,
p < .05, 95% CI = .04, .50). The proportion of the shared-environmental variance that was mediated by extraversion was calculated as .172/(.172 + .772) = 4.6%.

Discussion
Based on a large sample of MZ and same-sex DZ twins from the
Swedish Twin Registry, we used quantitative genetic methods to
examine the genetic inﬂuences on the propensity of these twins
to become entrepreneurs. For both males and females, we estimated the genetic, shared-environmental, and non-shared-environmental factors that inﬂuence the propensity to become
entrepreneurs. We found highly different heritability estimates
for males versus females. Females show a high heritability and zero
shared-environmental inﬂuences on their propensity to become
entrepreneurs (h2 = .60, after partialling out potential confounds).
The magnitude of this heritability estimate is even higher than
those typically found with personality variables (e.g., Loehlin,
1992). In contrast, entrepreneurship in males was not shown in
the current sample to be heritable, with a substantial effect of
shared-environment on entrepreneurship. Additionally, results
based on mediation analyses indicated that extraversion and neuroticism serve as partial mediators in the genetic inﬂuences on
the propensity of females to become entrepreneurs—a result that
replicates and extends previous research on the mediating effect
of sensation-seeking (a facet of extraversion) on entrepreneurship
(see Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, et al., 2008; Nicolaou, Shane,
Cherkas, & Spector, 2008). The proportion of mediated genetic inﬂuences on females’ entrepreneurship was 3.4%. For males, extraversion serves as a partial mediator in the shared-environmental
inﬂuences on entrepreneurship and the proportion of the mediated
shared-environmental variance was 4.6%. Apparently, the common
environment (e.g., family and common upbringings) for male twins
can inﬂuence their extraversion which, in turn, may inﬂuence their
propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities.
Although females show a high degree of heritability for entrepreneurship, our results do not indicate that genes determine
entrepreneurship. As Plomin, DeFries, and McClearn (1990, p.
376) posit, genetic inﬂuences on a behavior indicate ‘‘probabilistic
propensities rather than hard-wired patterns of behavior.” For the
females, 40% of the variance in entrepreneurship was still explained by unique environments and experiences. For males, we
found strong evidence of the shared-environmental effects on their
tendency to become entrepreneurs and the magnitude of sharedenvironmental inﬂuences on men’s entrepreneurship was about
the same as that of the genetic inﬂuences on women’s
entrepreneurship.
As suggested in our introduction, based on the diathesis-stress
model in behavioral genetics (see Gottesman, 1991; Rende & Plomin, 1992), adverse environments may foster higher genetic inﬂuences on the behavior of entrepreneurship. With respect to
explaining the results of the current study, it is possible that such
adverse environments may exist both in the home as well as outside the home in a variety of forms including gender role stereotypes. Given the birth cohorts that our samples of twins came
from, it is possible that the twins’ parents did not set positive
expectations for female twins to become entrepreneurs. Such
expectations may be a function of societal expectations that to
be an entrepreneur during that period in Sweden’s history, it was
important to be a male. Thus, females may have needed to overcome both an internal and external stressful environment to become entrepreneurs, potentially accounting for the dramatic
differences in heritability between males and females in the present study.
Theoretical contributions
Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed previous research which, based on a
predominately female sample, found that the tendency of women
to become entrepreneurs is heritable (Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas,

Hunkin, et al., 2008). Extending this line of research, we ﬁnd substantial gender differences in the heritability of entrepreneurship.
These ﬁndings highlight the value of research on female entrepreneurs and provide an alternative framework to reconcile the differences in the prevalence of male versus female entrepreneurs
observed in existing literature (see Brush, 1992; Jennings &
McDougald, 2007). Extant research on female versus male entrepreneurs often investigates ‘‘surface-level” differences such as education level, capital investment, and work-family responsibilities.
Our ﬁnding suggests that researchers need to incorporate more
‘‘deep-level” biological differences (such as genetic differences) in
order to better understand variation across genders in entrepreneurial outcomes.
This study also contributes to the entrepreneurship literature
by pointing out the gender-speciﬁc mechanisms that sharedenvironments may have on children’s tendency to become
entrepreneurs. While prior research suggests that parents’ entre-

preneurship promotes children’s probability to become entrepreneurs (Aldrich & Kim, 2007; Sorenson, 2007), the
intergenerational transmission of such inﬂuences may work
through different channels for female versus male children. The
fact that males have shared-environmental inﬂuences, but not
genetic inﬂuences, on their tendency to engage in entrepreneurial activities indicates that being raised in the same household
increases the similarity of male siblings in their tendencies to
engage in entrepreneurial activities. This may be due in part to
the higher likelihood of their father’s being entrepreneurs, and
offering a home-based model for the male twins to emulate.
Alternatively, our results indicate that the primary transmission
mechanism for females might be through the entrepreneurship-related genetic factors directly passed from parents to children, while males are more inﬂuenced by shared environments.
Thus, our study provides a new perspective on the gender-speciﬁc nature of the genetic inﬂuence on entrepreneurial activities.

We found a mediating role for extraversion and neuroticism in
the genetic inﬂuences on women’s entrepreneurship and for extraversion in the shared-environmental inﬂuences on men’s entrepreneurship. These results highlight the value of individual differences
in entrepreneurship research. Researchers interested in explaining
the propensity of people to become entrepreneurs have obtained
mixed ﬁndings when examining the role of individual differences
in entrepreneurship and have often turned to look at situational
variables as primary antecedents (e.g., Gartner, 1988; Shaver &
Scott, 1991). Turning to this strategy coincides with a tendency
among prior researchers to abandon the ‘‘individual entrepreneur”
as a means of studying entrepreneurship (see Mitchell et al., 2002).
As Cogliser and Brigham (2004) argued, this is like ‘‘throwing the
baby out with the bathwater”. In the world of business, practitioners and venture capitalists have continued to consider the individual entrepreneur to be critical to the success of a new venture
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Stuart & Abetti, 1990).
To reconcile the discrepancies that have emerged in terms of
prior research streams in the entrepreneurship literature, our ﬁndings offer an alternative direction for future research to integrate
situational and individual-difference antecedents in explaining
entrepreneurship. In particular, although males in the Swedish
sample have only environmental inﬂuences on their propensity
to become entrepreneurs, females were shown to have nonshared-environmental and genetic inﬂuences and these genetic
inﬂuences appear to be partially carried through personality variables such as extraversion and neuroticism. Consequently, future
entrepreneurship research may need to pay differential attention
to individual and environmental variables when different gender
groups are examined.
Practical implications
Prior research has long established the importance of family
environment in fostering entrepreneurship. Our ﬁndings that family environment plays a critical role in predicting males’ (but not
females’) propensity to become entrepreneurs has important
implications for informal and formal education on entrepreneurship. These results conﬁrmed prior arguments for differential reasons and processes for men and women to become entrepreneurs
(e.g., Shane, 2003). Given the adversity that female entrepreneurs
face both within the home and potentially outside in communities
and organizations, educators and policy makers may take measures to eliminate or reduce the obstacles and promote more equal
support for both gender groups. Furthermore, as more women
emerge as entrepreneurs around the world, the more likely parents
will realize that their daughters can grow up some day and run a
successful business. We believe that the home environment could
set positive self-fulﬁlling prophecies in motion early on in regards
to what females should be doing in terms of entrepreneurial careers, especially when more mothers become entrepreneurs. With
the cohort of twins examined in the current study, the more ‘‘adverse” environments may have provided greater opportunities for
heritability to account for entrepreneurship among females.
Researchers have shown that gender stereotypes negatively
inﬂuence the perceptions and evaluations of women leaders (e.g.,
Heilman, Martell, & Simon, 1988; Heilman, Wallen, Fuchs, & Tamkins, 2004; Schein, 2001). However, in a recent study conducted by
Duehr and Bono (2006), the authors reported that the stereotypes
that have traditionally differentiated male and female managers/
leaders have diminished in their impact over the last 15 years, with
this research showing a greater tendency for managerial and leadership roles to be seen as more communal or in line with a ‘‘female
leadership style”. We suspect that the changes occurring in terms
of perceptions of female characteristics and leadership roles may
parallel those with entrepreneurship. If that were the case over

time, we might then ﬁnd a greater impact attributable to early
environmental effects such as parenting expectations and role
modeling.
This study identiﬁed two personality characteristics extraversion and neuroticism as mechanisms through which genetic factors inﬂuence the tendency to become an entrepreneur for
females. In addition, extraversion also mediated the shared-environmental inﬂuences on men’s entrepreneurship. These ﬁndings
reconﬁrmed the importance of individual differences—especially
extraversion—in the venturing process and have implications for
the selection decisions for corporate venturing and the funding
decisions on start-ups. Corporate management and funding institutions can select potential intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs (both
male and female) based on their enduring individual differences
(e.g., extraversion).
Limitations
Like all research using twin samples, our study has limitations.
The most important limitation centers on issues of generalizability.
Our sample is constrained to white female and male twins in Sweden. Although this method rules out the effects of extraneous factors associated with different cultures and racial groups with
regard to entrepreneurship, the generalizability of our results to
other groups and cultures requires further investigation. Within
our sample, we are fortunate to have relatively heterogeneous
individuals in terms of age, educational levels, marital status, and
closeness of the twins. This heterogeneity might help mitigate
the concerns raised above regarding the generalizability of our
ﬁndings, but the homogeneity of culture and race in our sample
is nevertheless an important limitation that future research needs
to address.
Second, like many studies in behavioral genetics, we assume the
absence of assortative mating, which refers to a situation where
people with similar characteristics (e.g., being entrepreneurial or
extraverted) tend to mate. Assortative mating decreases the range
of variation on a speciﬁc phenotype and, thus, results in an overestimate of heritability of that phenotype.
Third, our cross-sectional data on entrepreneurship and personality variables are not appropriate for studying genetic inﬂuences
on the survival or the performance of new ventures. Thus, this
study only examined the propensity to become entrepreneurs,
rather than the performance of ventures or other aspects of entrepreneurship. Moreover, we operationalized entrepreneurship as a
composite measure of self-employment and company ownership.
Although prior research used a similar operationalization (see
Evans & Leighton, 1989), there remains a lack of consensus on
the deﬁnition of entrepreneurship in the literature. Future research
could follow a sample of twins over time and collect multiple measures of entrepreneurship and venture performance data repeatedly across multiple time periods. Using this strategy would help
test the generalizability our results to other ways of deﬁning entrepreneurship and venture performance.
Fourth, our measure of extraversion had an internal consistency
estimate that was on the borderline (a = .67). This is probably due
to the dichotomous nature of the items in the scale. We thus conducted omnibus CFAs to demonstrate the discriminant validity for
the two personality measures and the entrepreneurship variable.
The CFA results provided strong support for the distinctiveness of
the three constructs and may alleviate some concerns on the relatively low reliability of the extraversion measure.
Lastly, the current study did not explicitly examine any potential interactions between the environment and genetic inﬂuences
on entrepreneurship. Our estimates of the heritability for male
and female twins can be considered an average heritability estimate across all levels of a particular environmental variable

<-----Page 12----->Z. Zhang et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 93–107

(Purcell, 2002). Future research could examine environmental
harshness as a potential moderator of the genetic inﬂuences on
entrepreneurship. Speciﬁcally, researchers can measure environmental harshness as perceived by male and female twins during
their formative years and investigate whether the magnitude of genetic inﬂuences is moderated by environmental harshness.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study sheds new light on research regarding
individual differences and entrepreneurship, research which seems
to have fallen out of favor in the last few decades. Our results demonstrate the importance of genetic and shared-environmental factors in predicting the propensity of males and females to become
entrepreneurs. We found that extraversion and neuroticism play
a modest, yet statistically-signiﬁcant mediating role in the genetic
inﬂuence on females’ tendency to become entrepreneurs. We hope
our study will inspire additional research examining the antecedents of entrepreneurship, while taking into consideration biological determinants. Endeavors along this line can hopefully provide
valuable information that will aid policy makers in promoting
strategies to encourage entrepreneurship. Our research may also
provide guidance to future entrepreneurs that such individuals appear to be ‘‘both born and made”.
