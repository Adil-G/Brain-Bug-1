Venture capital (VC) has become an international phenomenon, and VC firms are a specific
kind of service firm whose characteristics have distinctive implications for international
behaviour. There is now a disparate body of research on international aspects of VC across
a number of disciplines comprising finance, economics, strategy, entrepreneurship, international business and economic geography. A novel aspect of this paper is that we review
and synthesize this disparate literature. A number of research gaps and limitations in the
theoretical and methodological approaches involved in previous studies are identified and
suggestions made for further research. We show that the vast majority of the literature relates
to cross-country comparisons; that is, macro-level comparisons of VC industries across
different countries and micro-level comparisons of VC behaviour across countries. From our
review of the literature, we argue that an under-researched area concerns the influence of
institutional contexts, especially the role of social networks and cultures. Furthermore, our
review of the literature indicates that there is a major research gap in relation to work
dealing with the crossing of country borders by VC firms. We suggest that resource-based,
capabilities, institutional and network theories may be offer insights to further our
understanding of the behaviour of VC firms in this area.

Introduction

This paper reviews the literature relating to
international venture capital (VC). Following
Wright and Robbie (1998), we adopt a broad
definition of VC to include the range of finance

from early stage ‘classic’ VC through to later
stage private equity for management buy-outs
and buy-ins (MBO/Is). While the US market
is generally characterized as focusing on the
earlier stages of investment, internationally,
members of VC associations provide the full

spectrum of equity funds for privately owned
enterprises and firm-level studies have typically drawn their samples from this wider
membership. There is also evidence that venturebacked MBO/Is may involve entrepreneurial
activity in uncertain environments (Bruining
and Wright 2002). We consider international
VC to involve cross-country comparisons of
VC firms as well as cross-border flows into VC
funds and outflows of funds into investments
in other countries.
The motivation for this review is threefold.
First, VC has become a conduit for the flow
of capital and ideas internationally (Bygrave
and Timmons 1999; Patricof 1989). As we
describe in more detail in the next section,
international VC is an increasingly important
phenomenon in terms of the sums of money
involved and its geographical diversity. In
Europe, for example, over the period since
1988, the share of inflows of VC from nondomestic sources more than doubled to 45%
of the market, while the share of total outflows accounted for by international investments rose almost fourfold to 29%.
Second, the burgeoning literature on international VC is appearing across a disparate range
of academic communities, including economics, finance, strategy, entrepreneurship, international business and economic geography. In
part, these literatures overlap, but they also
give rise to different perspectives, levels of
analysis and themes. Our focus is on the factors involved in the development of VC markets and the behaviour of VC firms within
those markets. An important contribution of
this paper is to organize systematically this
material into two levels and two themes. The
levels concern the macro level relating to the
development of the VC industry in a country
and the micro level of the behaviour of the VC
firm; and the internationalization themes concern cross-country comparisons and crossingborder activities.
Third, while internationalization in services
is different from that in manufacturing (Anand
and Delios 1997; Brouthers and Brouthers
2003; Domke-Damonte 2000), the sector is
136

heterogeneous (Buckley et al. 1992; Miller
and Parkhe 1998) with VC firms having distinctive implications for international behaviour. In contrast to consultants, lawyers and
accountants, venture capitalists provide both
guidance and money (Barry 1994). In contrast
to banks, VC investors provide specialized
resources and economies of scale in locating
and financing potentially successful ventures
in risky settings where it is costly for lenders
and borrowers to get together because of asymmetric information problems (Amit et al.
1998; Jeng and Wells 2000; Wright and Robbie 1998). For start-ups, there are few tangible
assets for banks to obtain collateral, and the
problems of adverse selection remain in relation to later stage deals (Robbie and Wright
1996). The information asymmetry problems
in VC investments are also likely to be greater
than those faced by M&A advisers involved
in acquisitions of established corporations.
Also in contrast to banks, VC firms, especially
closed-end limited partnerships, invest for a fixed
term before anticipating an exit to realize their
returns. In contrast to M&A specialists whose
main focus is transaction completion, VC firms
provide a continuing relationship with their
investees involving an active value-adding and
monitoring role (Jeng and Wells 2000) that
requires specialist skills (Black and Gilson
1998). Finally, VC firms render their services
in a distinctive, multi-stage sequential investment process (Hall and Hofer 1993; Tyebjee
and Bruno 1984).
In reviewing the international VC literature,
we limit the scope of our analysis in three
ways. We excluded work relating to the development of financial firms and markets more
generally, within which VC may play a part.
Similarly, the general entrepreneurial literature relating to the behavioural and psychological perspectives of individual opportunity
recognition in which the decision to seek VC
is a choice variable is also outside the scope
of our review. Future reviews that focus on
these two sets of literatures may usefully
incorporate the role of international VC. The
growing body of single-country studies from

<-----Page 2----->September
outside the US is also beyond the scope of our
review.
The remainder of the paper is structured as
follows. First, we briefly summarize trends in
international VC. We then review the literature under three main themes. The second
section takes a macro-level perspective to
review the factors influencing the international development of VC markets, both at the
level of cross-country comparisons and the
development of international VC industries
across countries. The third section adopts a
micro-level perspective to provide an overview
of the literature on cross-country comparisons
of VC behaviour, followed by a review of VC
firms’ behaviour when they cross borders. In
the fourth section, we reflect on the literature
reviewed to discuss research questions for
further research, appropriate theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches. Finally,
we draw conclusions.
Trends in International Venture Capital

The increasing importance of international VC,
noted above, has been driven by a number of
factors. First, there has been international
development of VC firms. Originating in the
US, VC firms spread to the UK and Western
Europe (Ooghe et al. 1991) and to Japan. Second, at the same time as developed markets
are becoming saturated, many developing
nations have undertaken radical regulatory
reforms, making them more conducive investment destinations as VC firms perceive increased
demand for investment opportunities (Gompers
and Lerner 1998). Venture capital markets in
Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong have become
well established (Kenney et al. 2002a,b,c)
while, more recently, significant growth has
occurred in other Asian countries notably
India. Third, opportunities for transnational
investment (Aylward 1998) by foreign VC
firms arise in countries with limited domestic
supply and can help stimulate domestic markets by creating exit opportunities in foreign
markets (Maula and Makela 2003). Fourth,
VC is emerging as an important growth engine

in the transition of the former centrally planned
economies of central and eastern Europe,
especially in countries such as Hungary and
Poland (Wright et al. 2004a). Most recently,
VC is growing rapidly in China. The variation
in the development of VC industries across
countries raises important questions concerning the causes of these developments and the
behaviour of venture capitalists in different
markets, which are increasingly interesting
international agencies such as the World Bank
and the OECD (Baygan and Freudenberg
2000; Kenney et al. 2002c).
The outcome of these driving factors is that
international VC inflows and outflows have
become highly significant (Baygan and Freudenberg 2000; EVCA 1999). In Europe, for
example, over the period since 1988, inflows
of VC from non-domestic sources rose from
$0.7 billion (20% of funds raised) to a peak of
$22.8 billion (47.6%) in 2000 and $12 billion
(44.6%) in 2003 (Table 1). With respect to international outflows into investments, the rise has
been from $0.3 billion (7.7% of investments)
in 1988 to a peak of $9.5 billion (27.3%) in
2000 and $8.4 billion (28.8%) in 2003.
A more detailed analysis of the importance
of international VC by country is shown in
Table 2). The importance of cross-border inflows
of VC is emphasized by the recognition that,
in both Europe and Asia, half of new funds
raised come from non-domestic sources, although
in the US this figure is generally less than
10% (Gompers 2005). While not as important
in terms of funds invested, cross-border disbursements still account for a significant 25%
of VC investments in Europe and 35% of
investments in Asia. In Europe as a whole,
29% of fund inflows are from outside Europe,
with a further 21% of inflows coming from
elsewhere in Europe, but outside the particular
country to which the fund relates. In contrast,
22% of funds invested in Europe are invested
elsewhere in Europe outside the originating
country, with a further 3% invested outside
Europe. In Asia, while the total percentage of
foreign fund inflows is about the same as for
Europe at around 50%, a much greater percentage

comes from outside Asia (37%) and a correspondingly smaller percentage from other countries within the region (14%). With respect to
outward investments, there is a similar pattern
to Europe with the largest proportion of foreign investments being within the region (29%)
and only a small percentage further afield (6%).
Within both Europe and Asia, there are larger
variations between individual countries with
respect to the foreign inflows and outflows of
funds. In their study of OECD countries,
Baygan and Freudenberg (2000) show that, in
some markets, foreign VC investment can outweigh domestic investment.
The importance of cross-border VC is emphasized in comparisons with early stage investments. Considerable VC research attention is
devoted to early stage finance, yet typically
larger shares of funds are involved in crossborder investments. In Asia, for example, 26%
of investments in 2002 were to seed and startup projects. In contrast, 35% of investments
involved cross-border deals. Similarly, in
Europe, 11% of investments in 2002 went to
seed and start-up ventures, whereas 24% of
investments were cross-border.

Macro Analysis: The Development of
International Venture Capital Markets

In this section, we focus on two bodies of literature that examine macro issues relating to the
international development of VC markets. First,
we focus on studies that consider the development
of VC and private equity markets across different
countries, i.e. the cross-country comparisons of
the development of VC industries. The macro
study of cross-country comparisons has been the
dominant approach to investigating international
VC at the macro level. Second, we examine the
relatively neglected issue of the process of
development of international VC industries.
Comparisons of Cross-Country
Developments

As highlighted above, the dominant focus of
research into the macro-level development of
international VC has been on differences in VC
industries across countries. A population ecology
perspective was adopted by Manigart (1994), who
found that the density of VC firms in a particular country has a strong effect on the founding

of new VC firms. Manigart also found that, when
populations in neighbouring countries emerge
before the local VC population, legitimation for
the emergence of the local population is increased.
A greater contribution to our understanding
the development of VC markets is provided
by papers that have used some dimension of

an institutional perspective. Initial work focused
on the financial environment, in particular,
that relating to the stock market. Black and
Gilson (1998) explain the presence of much
stronger VC industries in stock market-centred
systems by arguing that a well-developed stock
market permits venture capitalists to exit
139

<-----Page 5----->International venture capital research
through an IPO and that the ability to realize
gains in this way is critical to the existence of
a vibrant VC market. They argue that these
institutional factors are more important than
cultural differences in the willingness of individuals to take risks. Also they point to the
importance of path dependencies in the development of VC markets which make it difficult, for example, for bank-centred systems to
establish appropriate institutional infrastructures to support the development of VC.
Jeng and Wells (2000) and Megginson
(2004) lend some support to the Black and
Gilson argument regarding the importance of
stock markets, but find that market capitalization growth is not a significant determinant of
VC, while government policies can have a strong
impact through setting the regulatory framework. Jeng and Wells also make an important
distinction between the factors affecting the
development of early stage and later stage VC
activity, notably that IPOs are a significant
determinant only of later stage VC investing
across countries. Botazzi and Da Rin (2002)
show that high VC activity does not necessarily correspond to more IPOs.
Mayer et al. (2005) compare sources of funds
and investment activities of venture capitalists
in Germany, Israel, Japan and the UK, and
find significant differences across countries.
Venture capital investment patterns were also
found to differ across countries in terms of the
stage, sector of financed companies and geographical focus of investments. They find that
differences in investment patterns are related
to the variations in funding sources, but that the
relations differ across countries. Megginson
(2004) notes the importance of different sources
of funds for VC, especially pension funds
across markets in the US, Europe and Asia.
Institutional differences between countries
also affect the regional development of VC
across countries. For example, Klagge and
Martin (2004), Martin et al. (2002, 2005) and
Sunley et al. (2005) point to the limited
regional dispersion of VC firms in the UK
compared with Germany, which reflect the
spatial structure of the financial systems in the
140

two countries and which also interact with
differences in the institutional, regulatory and
corporate environment between the two countries. They suggest that a regionally based critical
mass of financial institutions, including regional
stock exchanges, and agents increases spatial
proximity between financial intermediaries
and private firms, and provides a crystallization point for VC firms.
The view of the importance of stock markets has been challenged recently by Armour
and Cumming (2004), who argue, in their
study of 15 countries covering a 13-year period,
that while a nation’s level of entrepreneurial
activity and idea generation are important
determinants of VC development, the legal
environment is as important as the stock market, that government involvement can hinder
the growth of private equity and that temporate bankruptcy laws stimulate entrepreneurial
demand for VC. They suggest that their evidence provides a strong case for legal reform.
The findings of this study are potentially
important for the application of legal institutional concepts to the development of VC
markets because, in contrast to other studies,
the above measures are directly of relevance
to VC markets. Studies that have played down
the role of legal factors have tended to draw
on measures relating to public markets based
on La Porta et al. (1997). Roe (2004) argues
that studies that examine corporate law worldwide tend to over-predict its importance in the
world’s richest nations and tend to underestimate the importance of its enforcement in
emerging markets.
Although these findings provide some
extension of the application of institutional
variables to the study of VC markets, they do
not consider the potential implications of the
wider institutional environment that includes
cultural and social factors (Wright et al. 2003b).
In their study of VC in India and Israel, Nye
and Wasserman (1999) show that differing
levels of political support, physical infrastructure and cultural learning have contributed to
very different outcomes in these growing VC
markets. There is also the need to understand
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 6----->September
the heterogeneity within apparently similar
regions. Asia, for example, contains both
developed and emerging countries as well as
countries with English, Germanic and Frenchbased systems of corporate law (La Porta et
al. 1998). Bruton et al. (2005) argue that the
nature of a country’s institutional environment
influences the development of its VC industry.
Bruton et al. (2002) cite the case of Singapore, where the regulatory environment created by the government and its agencies has
led to a greater emphasis on high technology
start-ups than elsewhere in Asia.
Kenney et al. (2002a,b,c), examining the
differential development of VC markets in
Asia, note the importance of investment opportunities, exit possibilities, government initiatives (e.g. tax incentives), the development of
a technological industrial base and sociocultural factors supporting entrepreneurship.
They also suggest that, across countries, VC
industries may develop differently where varieties of VC firm with different objectives are
dominant and where different financing
instruments are available. For example, captive venture capitalists may be more interested
in developing long-term relationships and
investing in less risky later stage investments.
Independent venture capitalists may be more
interested in financial gains, corporate venture
capitalists may be more interested in accessing new technology, and public sector VC firms
may have social as well as technological
objectives. Baygan and Freudenberg (2000),
in the context of OECD countries, echo some
of these points when they emphasize the
importance of the barriers to entrepreneurship
as a principal influence on the development of
VC markets in particular countries. They also
note the importance of a supply of capital
willing to finance risky investment and the
availability of a sufficient number of specialists with the necessary expertise to undertake
VC investment. Extending this point, country
differences within the European Union (EU)
in the development of VC may be generated
by individual government policies designed to
stimulate regional clusters of high technology

2005

industry as well as policies directly aimed at
stimulating regional VC (Martin et al. 2002).
Looking specifically at the later management buy-out end of the VC market, Wright et
al. (1992) examine the factors influencing the
differential development of management buyout markets in Western Europe. They identify
differences in source of transactions, infrastructure to complete transactions and the ability
to exit transactions. Wright et al. (2004a)
adapt this model to analyse the development
of later stage private equity markets in the EU
Accession States of Central and Eastern
Europe. This model has also been adopted by
Wright et al. (2003a) and Wright and Kitamura (2003) to examine the development of
the management buy-out market in Japan,
while Wright et al. (2005) compare developments in Europe and Japan.
Apart from the existence of laws, the
enforcement of those laws is an important
issue for financial investors. Legal enforcement is probably highest in the US, intermediary in Europe and erratic to non-existent in
certain parts of Asia (Bruton et al. 2003). It is
expected that law enforcement will affect the
way VC firms behave. Indeed, Leeds and Sunderland (2003) comment that a major reason
for the problems experienced by private
equity funds that entered emerging markets in
the 1990s was that the legal and regulatory
framework did not provide adequate investor
protection, and dramatic differences in accounting standards, corporate governance and
exit potential created problems. Similarly, the
closure of embryonic IPO markets in Europe
that stimulated growth in VC led to a reversal
of this trend (Megginson 2004).
The Development of International
Venture Capital Industries

In comparison to the literature on macro-level
cross-country comparisons, little research
attention has been devoted to focusing on the
international development of VC industries;
there are, however, exceptions. Baygan and
Freudenberg (2000) suggest that VC funds
141

<-----Page 7----->International venture capital research
may allocate finance beyond national boundaries into countries where entrepreneurship,
innovation, growth prospects and expected
returns are highest. Government policies designed to foster the demand side, notably creativity and entrepreneurship, may be conducive
to attracting foreign VC.
Kenney et al. (2002a,b,c) show that international VC grew initially through the internationalization of US VC firms, first to Europe
and then to Asia, as these firms sought new
investment opportunities (see also Gompers
2005). Interestingly, they note that these firms
often resorted to private equity and expansion
deals, as start-up opportunities were scarce.
The internationalization of VC activity from
Europe to the US came somewhat later, as VC
firms began to appreciate the more flexible
environment for high-tech investment in the
US. They comment that few firms are truly
global and that most VC firms operating internationally are multinational or transnational.
The development of internationalization of
VC markets may be linked to limited domestic opportunities for VC firms, cultural links
with neighbouring countries as well as the
availability of investment executives with VC
expertise and local country knowledge. For
example, US-trained immigrants may return
to their home country to establish foreign VC
firms (Kenney et al. 2002a).
Internationalization into countries may be
facilitated through the development of networks of contacts, for example through joint
ventures with financial firms. Wright et al.
(2003b) and Wright and Kitamura (2003) note
in the context of the private equity market in
Japan that a lack of access to networks can
pose a major barrier to foreign firm entry.
Micro Analysis: Venture Capital Firm
Behaviour Internationally

In this section, we focus on micro issues relating to the behaviour of venture capitalists
internationally. First, we review the literature
relating to cross-country comparisons of VC
firms, which has been the dominant research
142

focus at the micro level. Second, we review the
literature on venture capitalists crossing-borders.
Cross-Country Comparisons

This section reviews cross-country variations
in the nature of VC operations. For expositional purposes, we adopt the stages in the
process of the VC life cycle from fund organization and the raising of funds through the
various stages of the investment process
(Gompers and Lerner 1999; Wright and Robbie 1998). Our analysis pays particular attention both to the theoretical perspectives adopted
as well as empirical findings. Also, we focus
on studies which have compared behaviour in
different countries using common methodologies. We do not include studies of different
individual countries, since methodological
differences create problems of comparability.
Fund organization and fund raising. Venture
capital firms can be organized in several ways
which affect the nature of their fund raising
and their investment behaviour, including the
types of deals sought, the degree of their
involvement in monitoring and value-adding
activities and their investment time horizon.
These different organizational forms include:
independent limited partnerships established
and managed by professional VC firms that
act as general partners in managing the fund
on behalf of the limited partners; captive
funds that obtain their funding from a parent
financial institution; corporate VC firms that
are parts of trading corporations; semi-captive
firms that obtain their finance partly from
their parent and partly by raising closed end
funds; and public sector funds.
Megginson (2004) shows that, in the US,
VC firms primarily take the form of independent limited partnerships. In contrast, in
Europe, VC funds have generally been organized more as investment companies according
to various national laws or have been subsidiaries of larger financial groups. As a result, in
the US, VC firms tend to obtain their funds
from institutions such as pension funds whereas,
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 8----->September
in Europe, banks and other financial institutions are more important (Botazzi and Da Rin
2002). Karsai et al. (1998) show for the transition economies of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia how local legislation restricts the choice
of organizational form for VC firms.
There is limited work involving crosscountry studies of the issues involved in the
different forms of VC firm in terms of fund
raising and interacting with fund providers.
US-based work on the contractual arrangements for limited partnerships (Gompers and
Lerner 1996) and UK-based research on the
monitoring of venture capitalists by their
funds providers (Robbie et al. 1997) suggests
some areas where comparative cross-country
studies may be fruitful. In the sections that
follow, we also comment on differences between
different organizational forms of VC where
studies have controlled for these differences.
Deal generation and screening. A number of
studies have attempted to replicate US studies
elsewhere and have then made cross-country
comparisons to find significant differences in
the emphasis placed on screening criteria
between countries. Compared with venture
capitalists in Europe, Canada and the Asia
Pacific that base investment decisions on
fewer screening criteria, those in the US rank
nearly all screening criteria as ‘considerably’
important (Knight 1994; Ray and Turpin
1993). As Ray (1991) notes in replicating
MacMillan et al.’s (1985) study and comparing the US with Singapore, investors’ lack of
experience and learning in the former set of
countries leads to a narrower band of reasons
for rejecting prospective portfolio clients.
Another striking difference relates to the
greater importance of significant market growth
in the US (Knight 1994). In Asia Pacific, the
tradition of opportunism and new business
creation, as well as a need to compete internationally, place a substantially greater emphasis
on whether the proposal creates a new market
(Knight 1994; Ray 1991).
There are also differences in the relative
importance of criteria across developed and
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

emerging markets. Difficulties in assessing
managerial capabilities, together with, for instance,
short private-sector experience of entrepreneurs in transition economies, necessitate reliance on foreign business education or work
exposure to Western business practices as
alternative signals of managerial capability
(Bliss 1999). In the Asia Pacific region, personality compatibility is significantly more
important for venture capitalists than for those
in the US, Europe and Canada (Knight 1994).
Later studies have begun to highlight the
importance of institutional factors. The difficult institutional conditions of transition economies lead VC firms to place relatively greater
emphasis on ownership stakes and mutual
agreement about the legal structure of investments (Bliss 1999; Karsai et al. 1997). The nature
of the capital market is significantly more
important in the emerging markets of India and
the Asia Pacific region (Knight 1994; Wright
et al. 2002) than in more developed markets.
Information, valuation and structuring. Studies, which have generally been based on questionnaire surveys, show significant differences
in the information sources, target rates of
return and valuation methods adopted by VC
firms when undertaking investment appraisals.
Financial theory, resource-based theory (RBV)
and institutional theory have been used to
examine these issues.
Unlike the emphasis on outside specialists
in developed markets, the absence of welldeveloped networks of intermediaries and
consultants in emerging markets necessitates
greater reliance on firms’ own expertise for
investment appraisal (Karsai et al. 1999; Ray
1991; Ray and Turpin 1993; Wright et al.
2000a). Compared with the UK and Continental Europe, VC industries in emerging markets
are characterized by significantly greater
emphasis on information relating to product,
market and proposed exit timing and methods
(Manigart et al. 1997, 1999; Karsai et al. 2000).
Also predominant in Japan and Singapore are
personal judgement and in-house specialists
(Ray 1991; Ray and Turpin 1993).
143

<-----Page 9----->International venture capital research
Target rates of return also vary across markets (Manigart et al. 2002). Consistent with
the RBV, Manigart et al. find that early-stage
venture capitalists require a significantly higher
return than other venture capitalists when
investing in late stage ventures. Consistent
with financial theory, they find that buy-out
specialists require a significantly lower return
than do other venture capitalists when investing in later stage companies. They find higher
required returns are required by venture capitalists located in the US and UK compared
with those located in France, Belgium and the
Netherlands, which they infer is attributable to
differences in institutional, legal and cultural
contexts, specifically with respect to the relative development of capital markets requiring
more frequent valuation of companies in the
former two countries. They also find an
important influence of the venture capitalists’
organizational form in that independent venture capitalists seek significantly higher returns
than captives or public sector venture capitalists. Unlike in developed markets, where target rates of return are typically based on the
characteristics of a specific investment, there
is a lack of a clear correspondence between
return and investment stage (a proxy for risk)
in transition economies (Karsai et al. 1999).
Financial theory has been used in conjunction with institutional theory to examine the
methods of valuation adopted by venture capitalists in different markets (Lockett et al. 2002;
Manigart et al. 2000; Wright et al. 2004b).
Since VC executives in developed markets
have greater expertise and skills to evaluate
proposals, valuation practices are more sophisticated. Owing to developed capital markets,
the valuation process also relies on standard
corporate finance theory developed in an advanced capital market context. In contrast, in
transition economies, the absence of welldeveloped capital and asset markets and concerns about the reliability of past trading
records mean that venture capitalists attach
noticeably greater importance to cash flow
methods (Karsai et al. 1999; Wright and
Robbie 1996).
144

In their nine-country study covering the
US, Europe and Asia, Wright et al. (2004b)
conclude that the legal system, and its implication for capital markets, may be more
important in explaining the source of information used than it is for the valuation methods
used. Cultural factors play an important role
in the relative importance placed on information provided by entrepreneurs and in the
business plan, and in the extent to which alternative external sources are sought. This suggests that information sources are not so
easily transferred from one context to another.
The actual sources of information that VC
firms trust may vary both between and within
legal systems and geographic regions. This
study did not find that the organization form
of VC was significantly related to valuation
method used, although there was some weak
association with the use of information from
entrepreneurs and from business plans. These
findings indicate that apparently similar systems and markets may in fact be heterogeneous. Further analysis might usefully explore
the rationale for such differences in a more
fine-grained way that takes account of different institutional contexts.
A parallel stream of research has made use
of archival data, either through proprietary
data sets or databases that have become publicly available. These data sources provide
scope for more robust analyses to complement
studies based on attitudinal questionnaire data.
This research has focused on corporate and
tax law environments to suggest that these
may affect the financing structure in VC and
buy-out investments. Such differences can
affect the legal ability to use certain instruments as well as their efficacy from a tax
point of view (Wright et al. 1992). For example, although convertible instruments are a
key feature of the US and UK VC markets,
where common law codes permit flexibility in
the development of new financial instruments,
this is not the case in civil code countries
which may prohibit such instruments (Cumming and Flemming 2004). Tax benefits associated with convertible securities in the US
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 10----->September
and the coexistence of public and private VC
in Canada and Continental Europe may explain
differences in the use of convertible instruments (Cumming 2002). In the UK, the use of
convertible preference shares has been replaced
by convertible debt following changes to the
taxation regime. For Germany, Bascha and
Walz (2001) show that VC firms rarely employ
convertible securities, which may in part be
due to legal restrictions on conversion rights
for certain legal forms under German corporate law. Lerner and Schoar (2003), in their
study of VC in developing markets, conclude
that differences in corporate and tax law affect
transaction structure. Lerner and Schoar (2005)
examine 210 private equity investments in
developing countries and find that investments
in high enforcement common law countries
often use convertible preferred shares with
covenants. In contrast, in low enforcement
and civil law countries, private equity firms
tend to use ordinary shares and debt and rely
on equity and board control as a substitute for
the lack of contractual protection.
At the same time, however, there exist
some variations within emerging economies.
In India, for example, there are restrictions on
venture funds in the form of a low limit of the
permissible debt–equity ratio. Leverage tends
to be higher on average for ventures in the
Philippines and Korea, and lower on average
in China and Taiwan (Aylward 1998).
This research has been supported by questionnaire work that shows that Central and
Eastern Europe (CEE) private equity investors
employ similarly sophisticated financing instruments and contract provisions as investors
in established markets, such as convertible
securities and the stipulation of drag-along
rights among other covenants, with the former
exceeding the relevance of such instruments
in Germany (Farag et al. 2004). These findings are consistent with theoretical considerations highlighting the importance of flexible
financial contracting practices for negating
the effects of information asymmetries, which
may be more pronounced in CEE than in
Western Europe. Furthermore, the elaborate
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

use of advanced financial contracting schemes
underscores the development of investment
skills by CEE private equity investors and
may reflect the ease of transfer of general
professional skills and mechanisms to new
markets (Wright et al. 2002).
For later stage investments, the relative
availability of different forms of debt may
also differentiate financing structures between
countries; for example, in CEE, the underdeveloped banking system meant that long-term
debt did not become available in significant
amounts until well after 2000 (Wright et al.
2004a). The ability to enforce legal contracts
may also affect the nature of the financing
structure, with VC firms likely to seek majority equity stakes in emerging markets where
the rights of minority shareholders are weak
(Karsai et al. 1998).
Post-investment activities. Building on an
Anglo-American perspective, agency theory is
the most commonly used theoretical lens
through which to examine differences in monitoring across countries. To some extent, the
monitoring behaviour of venture capitalists
represents this normative institutional perspective whereby incumbent firms follow professional norms. For example, a seat on the
boards of investee companies or the right to
appoint a director at a later stage and right of
access to information are present in both the
established UK market and the relatively new
markets of Singapore and India (Pruthi et al.
2003; Ray 1991). As Bruton et al. (2005)
explain, whereas the interactions and roles of
new entrants to an industry are initially determined by economic efficiency concerns, later
entrants respond more to isomorphic forces,
tending to follow commonly held beliefs and
replicating the conduct of the originators.
Sapienza et al. (1996) adopt a mixed
theoretical approach that extends an agency
perspective to include business risk and information processing theories. They examine the
antecedents to venture capitalists’ monitoring
and find that venture capitalists in the US
and UK expend more effort in value-adding
145

<-----Page 11----->International venture capital research
activities than those in the Netherlands, although the importance accorded to the various
VC monitoring and added value roles were
consistent in each country. The fact that their
results best predicted the behaviour of venture
capitalists in the US, where the theories they
use were largely developed, supports the view
that theories are culturally bound.
Adopting an institutional cultural perspective helps understand the existence of differences between developed and emerging markets
in respect of monitoring mechanisms and postinvestment service provision. Asian boards of
venture-backed firms are significantly larger
than European boards, while the number of
insiders on Asian boards is also greater than
those in the US or Europe (Bruton et al. 2005).
Unlike in the West, CEOs of VC-funded firms
in Asia are not removed as frequently (Bruton
et al. 2003). This is because VC in the US is
structured in order to maximize returns to VC
firms, to minimize agency risk, and to maximize efficiency in the operation of the VC firm
itself. Implicit in these rationales is the belief
that VC firms and their entrepreneurial investment firms are two totally separate and independent entities. The relationship between the
venture capitalist and the entrepreneur in
Asia, on the other hand, is that of a collective
entity. There is less need, therefore, to control
agency risk. Whereas in the West, the focus of
the board is on efficient decision-making by
those who have control of the firm, Asian firms
emphasize the effort to build relationships
among the officers of the firm and outside
stakeholders. Hence, as a result of the greater
emphasis on the group rather than on individuals, agency concerns, such as exist especially
in the US, are not perceived as present in Asia
(Hofstede and Bond 1988). Differences in behaviour from the US are also evident in CEE.
Evidence from Hungary, Poland and Slovakia
for instance, suggests considerable emphasis
on keeping the position under review and on
requesting more in-depth information rather
than taking precipitous action (Wright et al. 1999).
Comparisons of the services provided by
venture capitalists in the US and in emerging
146

markets suggest that the former are more
involved in serving as a sounding board to the
entrepreneurial team and in financially oriented activities (Macmillan et al. 1985), while
the latter place more emphasis on making
introductions to potential customers and suppliers, and assisting with marketing plans is
relatively more important (Pruthi et al. 2003).
This is because, relative to developed markets,
marketing problems coupled with the inability
of investors to compete effectively are rated
very highly in emerging markets (Gorman and
Sahlman 1989; Wright et al. 1999). Again, this
stresses the importance of institutional differences between countries.
Investment realization. The feasibility of different exit routes may vary between legal systems, most obviously with respect to the
availability of stock markets. Adopting a capital markets theory perspective, Black and
Gilson (1998) argue that the highest return
exits in developed VC markets are realized
through IPOs (Black and Gilson 1998). This
is because investors in these markets possess
the international resources to take successful
investments to a public listing (Murray 1994).
Moreover, as La Porta et al. (1997) indicate,
in comparison with civil law countries, common law countries have broader and higher
valued capital markets. Better quality of the
legal environment in terms of strong shareholder rights or legal protection of investors
against expropriation by entrepreneurs permits easier access to capital markets and flow
of new companies obtaining equity finance
(Black and Gilson 1998; Wright et al. 1992).
Venture capital firms in emerging VC markets, on the one hand, have very little experience with the process of taking firms public
(Ray 1991). Although the development of a
second tier stock market is likely to enable
many growth-oriented companies at anticipating exits through IPOs, entrepreneurs in Singapore, for instance, unlike their counterparts
in developed markets, are not very comfortable
with liquidating their investments completely.
Venture capital firms in transition economies

<-----Page 12----->September
such as Hungary, on the other hand, aim to
float their ventures in more developed foreign
markets (Karsai et al. 1997). Except in the
context of the privatization process, IPOs and
capital increases through the stock market
remain very rare (EBRD 1998). This is because,
despite improvements in the regulatory and
institutional framework, the non-bank sector
remains underdeveloped and market capitalization on stock exchanges is relatively low.
Sales to strategic partners are typically the
most common form of exit, yet a number of
issues are raised about this option in different
contexts. Not only do acquisitions markets vary
in terms of their stage of development, but
there may be different attitudes with respect to
the sale of majority versus minority stakes,
and different regulations regarding sales to
foreigners, etc. Cumming and Fleming (2004)
adopt a legal system perspective and show
that, for the Asia-Pacific region, a high legality index is associated with a greater likelihood of exit through IPO or trade sale but that
a high legality index is neither necessary nor
sufficient for the development of a successful
VC market.
Wright et al. (1993) adopt a broad contingency perspective to explain the influences on
exits in the buy-out segment of the VC market
in four European countries. This perspective
incorporates a range of institutional factors,
including the state of development of asset
and stock markets, legal infrastructures affecting the nature of VC firms’ structures and the
differing roles and objectives of management
and venture capitalists.
Crossing Borders

Research focusing on issues relating to the
internationalization of VC firms is the most
underdeveloped of the areas we consider. This
underdevelopment is surprising, given the
extent of cross-border investment activity by
venture capitalists noted earlier in this paper.
In this section, and consistent with the previous section, we summarize the limited work
on international investment behaviour by
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

venture capitalists following the stages in the
process of the VC life cycle. Internationalization is defined as both the raising of funds by
VC firms from outside the markets in which
they are headquartered and their investment
into portfolio companies outside the market in
which they are headquartered through a variety of entry modes, including direct arms’
length investment and a physical presence.
Fund organization, motivations and strategies.
Analysis of the internationalization strategies
of VC firms has used a mix of aggregate
archival data and case studies. With respect to
location choice, Hall and Tu (2003) suggest
that the willingness of VC firms to invest
overseas is positively related to the size of the
VC firm and the investment stage of their
investees, and negatively to the age of the VC
firm. Interestingly, this study finds that internationalization is not related to the type of VC
firm ownership.
A large-scale study of internationalization
by US VC firms by Guler and Guillen (2004)
suggests that, rather than environmental
uncertainty, the decision to invest internationally is driven by the availability of innovative
investment opportunities ideas that are perceived to offer the opportunity to earn superior returns.
Cultural differences and geographical distance may create problems in cross-border VC
investments (Meyer and Shao 1995). Venture
capitalists may attempt to replicate their
domestic mode of operation when entering
foreign markets or may adapt to local environmental conditions, producing isomorphism
among firms. Foreign entrants may, however,
retain some distinctiveness as they attempt to
compete on the basis of some aspect of differentiation. This proposition is informed by
institutional theory, which asserts that organizations seek to adopt strategies, structures and
processes that reflect the institutional environment through isomorphic adaptation (Zalan
2004). Zhang (2002) noted that, for foreign
investors to address the high risks of investing
in China, they need to adapt to local market
147

<-----Page 13----->International venture capital research
conditions. In a recent study of VC firms in
East Asia, Bruton et al. (2005) contend that
institutional features such as ownership structure, family control and codes of corporate
governance influence the differences between
Western and East Asian VC firms’ investment
behaviour.
Based on case studies of US private equity
firms, Dixit and Jayaraman (2001) suggest
three models of internationalization. These are
identified as a specialized fund model, whereby
funds are specialized by stage of investment
and geographical region, the organic growth
model, based on an integrated approach that
involves the transfer of expertise from the
domestic market, and the affiliate model, based
on co-investment with a local domestic partner.
Evidence from a representative survey of
37 UK venture capitalists that had internationalized shows that arm’s length investing (25
firms) appears to be the most popular means
of foreign market entry, followed by the establishment of branch offices (21 firms) (Pruthi
2004). There were few instances of firms
entering through acquiring stakes in existing
funds in the concerned markets (three firms)
or of joint ventures/alliances, acquisitions (two
cases of each) or licensing, and franchising
was reported only once. These findings indicate that venture capitalists may engage in
more than one form of market presence.
This survey also showed that UK venture
capitalists that internationalized adopt both
formal and informal controls for controlling
and co-ordinating their foreign operations but
that informal controls were, on an average,
rated more highly (Pruthi 2004). Among formal controls, ‘direct reporting by investment
executives in foreign operation …’ was rated
most highly (mean score 5.5 on a 7 point
scale, where 7 = very important; SD 1.5), followed by ‘investment committee membership
…’ (mean 5.1; SD 1.6) and ‘highly standardized and formal reporting systems’ (mean 4.9;
SD 1.5), respectively. Among informal controls, ‘regular telephone/e-mail contact’ (mean
6.4; SD 0.7) received the highest rating followed by ‘regular group meetings’ (mean 5.9;
148

SD 1.0) and ‘frequent overseas trips and visits
…’ (mean 5.9; SD 0.9), respectively.
An important aspect of the strategy and
organization of venture capitalists entering
foreign markets concerns the skills of executives operating in that market. Beaverstock
(2004) shows that legal firms expatriate staff
to their international offices but, simultaneously, employ the services of ‘local’ staff to
practise local jurisdiction law. However, the
nature of expatriation varies according to international region. In east Asia, expatriation followed a ‘Multinational’ typology, characterized
by one-way knowledge diffusion from London
with expatriates managing overseas offices. In
contrast, expatriation in Europe and North
America reflected a ‘Transnational’ typology,
where knowledge was developed and diffused
in a network of relationships in which expatriates worked with locally qualified partners
and lawyers, and expatriates of other nationalities, in an environment where locals, expatriates of other nationalities and British qualified
staff managed offices. Leeds and Sunderland
(2003) provide anecdotal evidence on the
need for locally based VC personnel who are
culturally attuned. Evidence from foreign venture capitalists in India suggests that about a
third of executives have VC experience outside the country and that 91% are Indian
nationals (Wright et al. 2002). Further research
is required to examine whether the different
patterns identified in respect of legal firms
also hold for venture capitalists.
Deal generation and screening. For venture
capitalists to invest cross-border, there need to
be opportunities for investment in local entrepreneurs. However, cross-border investment
poses particular challenges for identifying
deals. Different entry modes suggest different
approaches to deal generation and screening
and possibly different types of deal. For example,
a physical presence in a country may provide
greater integration into local networks of entrepreneurs and intermediaries necessary to
access early stage deals. In contrast, arms’
length investment from the venture capitalist’s
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 14----->September
home base may be more feasible for investments such as divestments of divisions by
multinational firms.
The presence of local VC investors with
whom to partner in a syndicate may play an
important role in taking on certain responsibilities that may be easier to manage from a
domestic position (Mäkelä and Maula 2005;
Maula and Mäkelä 2003). These local investors need to have extensive international
social capital, that is, networks with foreign
VC firms. They are attractive to foreign investors, because they have information about the
operation of the local market, including
access to deal flow as well as dense networks
of contacts and familiarity with different legal
requirements. Local investors can play a certification role regarding potential investees
for incoming investors, that is identify attractive deals and, by being in close proximity,
may be more able to provide monitoring and
value-adding activities than is possible for a
distant foreign investor, although this need may
be reduced if the entrepreneurial firm already
has expertise and where the venture’s markets
are largely international.
Information, valuation and structuring. Wright
et al. (2002) examine internationalization
issues in the Indian VC market with respect to
information and valuation. Adopting a mixed
internationalization and institutional approach,
they compare the behaviour of foreign
(mainly US) and domestic VC firms in India
and VC firms in the US. They find more significant differences between foreign venture
capitalists in India and US VC firms than
between Indian foreign and domestic VC
firms, suggesting adaptation by foreign VC
firms as they enter overseas markets.
The financing instruments used by VC
firms when they make cross-border investments may vary. Cumming (2002) finds that
US VC firms investing domestically made
extensive use of convertible preferred equity
but, when they invested in Canadian-based
ventures, they used a wider variety of financial instruments. Cumming attributes this
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

difference in behaviour to institutional differences between countries, such as differences
in attractiveness of certain instruments for
purposes of taxation relief. The different financial structuring behaviour of VC firms when
they invest cross-border is an area for further
research, especially with respect to differences between common law and civil code
institutional regimes that permit or restrict the
use of particular instruments.
Post-investment activities. Pruthi et al. (2003)
adopt a mixed agency and institutional perspective to examine the monitoring and valueadding approaches adopted by foreign and
domestic firms in India. They find that foreign
venture capitalists were more likely to be
involved in investees at the strategic level,
while domestic venture capitalists were more
likely to be active at the operational level.
This finding is consistent with the arguments
of Maula and Mäkelä (2003). However, the
organization form of the VC did not have a
significant effect (Pruthi et al. 2003).
Hurry et al. (1992) examine the monitoring
behaviour of Japanese VC firms in the US.
They show that US VC firms are more likely
to have greater incentives and ability to monitor investees than Japanese VC firms as they
tend to make fewer investments and take
larger equity stakes. These differences, they
suggest, were largely attributable to the different rationales for VC investment by the firms
from the two countries, the former seeing
investments in terms of projects that will earn
returns, while the latter view investments as
options to be taken up when the investor is
ready.
With respect to value-adding behaviour,
Maula and Mäkelä (2003) in their examination of VC portfolio firms observe that foreign
investors significantly aid the internationalization of their portfolio companies by helping
them develop a global perspective to their
business. Their networks expose internationalizing firms to opportunities, learning and
benefits from the pooling of resources. Valueadded contributions in foreign markets pertain
149

<-----Page 15----->International venture capital research
to establishing foreign offices, recruiting
new people, attracting foreign customers,
opening doors to business partners, conveying
knowledge of the legal environment, enhancing credibility and providing contacts to
financiers.
The presence of foreign investors in a syndicate of venture capitalists can affect their
commitment to a venture when it experiences
problems. In their detailed case study approach
in Finland, Mäkelä and Maula (2005) propose
that cross-border investors are likely to react
more strongly to changes in expectations the
more distant they were. However, they were more
likely to show continued commitment, despite
declining expectations from an investee if
they are more embedded in the focal country
through other investments or co-investments
with the same investors. This also raises issues
concerning reputation risk if the foreign venture
capitalist were to withdraw from one investment. Several factors such as geographic and
cultural distance, dependence of the foreign
investor on investors and entrepreneurs in the
key locations of the venture, and financial relevance of the venture seem to affect the commitment of venture capitalists in foreign markets
(Maula and Mäkelä 2003).
Investment realization. Cross-border involvement by VC firms can also influence exit
behaviour. Using a large sample of European
VC-backed ventures and their exits, Jäässkeläinen and Maula (2005) suggest that the presence of foreign venture capitalists reduces the
informational problems related to the arrangement of exits through IPOs and trade sales in
foreign markets, thus increasing the likelihood
of such exits. The social capital and existing
contacts of foreign venture capitalists increase
the diffusion of information among potential
investors, thus enabling identification of potential exit opportunities. In addition to these
direct ties, indirect ties through international
syndication by domestic VC firms also increase
the propensity for foreign exits. The presence
of foreign investors also signals the quality
and legitimacy of the venture.

Discussion

Below, we identify a number of research gaps
and limitations in previous research and suggest areas for further research.
Macro Analysis

There is a growing body of work examining
the factors influencing the development of VC
markets internationally. Our review of the literature highlights theoretical and methodological issues for the future of research into the
area and research opportunities.
First, in terms of theory, too much emphasis to date has been placed on the role of stock
markets. This is particularly the case with
studies that focus on cross-country comparisons of VC industries. Our review of the literature highlights the need to consider specific
legal environments that influence VC rather
than law relating just to public companies. An
under-researched area in the context of international comparisons concerns the influence
of wider environmental factors that include
social networks and cultures.
Second, in terms of method, much of the
analysis to date has, with the main exception
of Armour and Cumming (2004), been static
in nature. As with the issue of theory, this is
particularly the case with studies that focus on
cross-country comparisons of VC industries.
Research in this area has used a variety of approaches from qualitative analyses based on
interview (e.g. Bruton et al. 2003) and archival data (e.g. Black and Gilson 1998) to quantitative analyses using cross-sectional and
longitudinal techniques (e.g. Armour and
Cumming 2004; Jeng and Wells 2000). While
qualitative analyses were appropriate to explore
the conceptual issues underlying market development, further research now needs to adopt
longitudinal data analysis techniques to examine the changing patterns of development
across VC markets. For example, the emergence of previously underdeveloped VC and
private equity markets (Lockett and Wright
2002) creates a need for analysis of the dynamic
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 16----->September
aspects of the institutional context that may be
contributing to these changes. For example,
how do VC markets respond to changes in institutional factors? This research could be undertaken using time series analysis with data on
the trends in VC markets taken from VC association directories and changes in the kind of
variables used in the studies reviewed here.
Third, the dominant focus of research at the
macro-level has been on comparing VC industries across countries. As such, opportunities
exist for scholars to produce research that is
focused on the relatively neglected issue of
the development of international VC industries, i.e. VC crossing country borders. We
consider, however, that the relative lack of
research into the process of the international
development of VC industries may well reflect
the methodological difficulties associated with
trying to perform longitudinal research. There
is also a lack of analysis of the relative importance of supply- and demand-side aspects of
the international development of VC. While
there is an increasing supply of VC funds, VC
will only flow to a country if there are thought
to be good investment opportunities. Further
research needs to address the question: what
are the demand pull factors in different international contexts and how can these be
matched with the supply of VC? Such work
could be undertaken using archival data relating to changes in the structure of industry, the
development of entrepreneurship, regulatory
changes, etc. as well as through surveys of
entrepreneurs who may be seeking to grow
their business and/or to internationalize and
who require finance to realize these goals.
Fourth, there is a need for longitudinal
analysis to examine the research questions:
why and to what extent are the factors driving
the development of different markets and
the shift from national to international markets in terms of cross-border inflows and outflows of funds changing? Such research will
enable a clearer perspective on the extent to
which the VC market is becoming a series of
developed national markets or a global one to
be obtained.

Micro Cross-Country Comparisons

The body of work dealing with cross-country
comparisons in the behaviour of venture capitalists is now adopting a more conceptually
based approach than earlier studies. There is
some recognition of the limitations in the generalisability of agency and financial theory
approaches to different contexts with the development of an appreciation of institutional
contexts. This appears to be particularly the
case in respect of research on information and
valuation as well as that relating to postinvestment activities. Research that explicitly
develops an institutional perspective, however,
remains limited. With regard to cross-country
comparisons, we suggest that there is an important need to develop an institutional perspective to understanding both the development of
VC markets and differences in the behaviour
of venture capitalists across markets.
Although some progress has been made in
this area, an important issue to emerge is the
requirement to consider a broad interpretation
of institutional aspects that include financial
and legal dimensions that were specific to VC
markets as well as social and cultural factors.
As with research examining the development
of VC markets, the focus on different legal
systems as the main institutional influence
addresses only a limited aspect of the institutional environment. There is, therefore, a need
for further research that takes a more explicit
account of cultural and social network aspects
of different institutional environments and
which may affect the behaviour of VC firms.
In particular, while networks are an important
aspect of VC operations, and there is extensive examination of the role of networks in the
entrepreneurship and single country VC literature, in our view insufficient analysis has
been undertaken in terms of their differences
between countries. While networks are generally seen to be stronger in much of Europe
compared with the US, the emphasis in Asian
culture on networks (Boisot and Child 1996;
Orru et al. 1997) may even be much stronger
(Tsang and Walls 1998). For example, the
151

<-----Page 17----->International venture capital research
importance of social and particularly family
networks in East Asian businesses (Claessens
et al. 2000) means that connections and relationships with potential clients are likely to be
far more important than in the West. These
relationships may have implications for venture capitalists: for example, in terms of sourcing
deals, the substitution of implicit relationships
for explicit contracts (Allen and Song 2002),
and the monitoring of investees where boards
of directors are dominated by extended family
members. These dimensions raise interesting
research questions. How does venture capitalists’ use of networks to identify the demand
for VC from potential deals differ between
different institutional contexts? What is the
nature of the trade-offs venture capitalists
make between, for example, the skills of management and market factors in screening deals
in different institutional contexts? Given that
there may be important heterogeneity in the
culture and institutional environment among
apparently similar geographic regions, this
research may need to be fine-grained in terms
of identifying differences in the nature of networks within geographic regions (e.g. within
South and East Asia) and between regions
(e.g. between Europe and South and East
Asia). Bruton et al. (2005), for example, discuss the different dimensions of institutions
and cultures that might provide a useful basis
for operationalizing such work.
A further dimension concerns examination
of deal screening criteria. Studies have begun
to recognize the importance that venture capitalists place on trade-offs between different
criteria. Cross-country studies, however, have
paid little direct attention to how these tradeoffs may differ in different contexts, yet differences in the institutional environment,
including entrepreneurial expertise, organizational resources and the nature of products
and product markets suggest that they may
well be important. A major research question,
therefore, concerns how do the trade-offs that
venture capitalists make between deal screening criteria differ between countries? Established techniques of conjoint analysis can be
152

used to undertake such analyses (Muzyka
et al. 1996).
Cross-country archival research is beginning to appear that compares VC contracting
in different legal system contexts (Kaplan
et al. 2005), providing a valuable advancement
on self-report questionnaire studies. However,
work has been limited by access to records of
certain funds. Further research is needed to
answer the question to what extent does contracting differ between different types of VC
firms in different country contexts. There is
also a need to understand more about crosscountry differences in how these contracts are
actually used in monitoring investees. Do venture capitalists in some countries place more
reliance on contracts for monitoring or do
relationships play a greater role? Do these
differences relate to differences between AngloAmerican and network-type countries or are
they related to different types of VC firm irrespective of country context? Much work on
VC monitoring has been based on questionnaire surveys. The private nature of VC and
hence limited disclosure makes for difficulties
in using archival studies on this aspect. As the
general corporate governance area has recognized different governance mechanisms and
processes between countries, there is a need to
address the research question as to what extent
do monitoring methods by venture capitalists
differ between countries or whether professional norms transcend country differences.
There is a need to construct proprietorial data
sets based on venture capitalists’ records that
address this issue.
Methodologically, work relating to crosscountry comparison concerns has traditionally
been based on mail questionnaire data with
limited use made of archival data. For some
countries, it is possible to obtain high response
rates and representative samples, but this can
be problematical in some regions, such as
CEE and parts of Asia. In some countries, it
may be necessary to adopt different datagathering approaches, such as face-to-face
interviews, where mail questionnaires are less
feasible either owing to problems with the mail
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 18----->September
system or because respondents are resistant to
them. There is also a need to address problems relating to comprehension of questions
across different contexts and simultaneity of
timing of administration of questionnaires.
The small number of VC firms in many
emerging markets also limits the use of multivariate analysis techniques unless multiple
countries are considered. The private nature of
VC markets means that publicly available
archival data sources are limited, especially
across countries and in emerging markets in
particular. This can pose problems in obtaining data such as financing structures, VC
board membership, investment realization patterns, etc. Cross-country studies of exits of
venture-backed investments through IPOs
may be more practicable because of the availability of flotation prospectuses. US VC
researchers have obtained access to proprietary and on-line databases such as Venture
Economics and Venture One. The extension of
these databases compiled by specialist information providers such as Initiative Europe and
Thomson may, over time, provide access to
appropriate archival data in Europe and elsewhere. However, as these databases are not
typically designed for academic research purposes, there may be a need to supplement
them with data from other sources. Relatedly,
commercial databases may also be compiled
with an emphasis on timeliness, which may
mean that they are not compiled to the standards of academic inquiry. Differential reporting of data between countries may also mean
that care needs to be taken in simply drawing
data from these sources without some crosschecking, for example that the size and stage
scope of VC firms covered is the same for
each country.
Cross-country comparison studies have
largely used common research instruments
developed in one country initially and adapted
where appropriate to different country contexts or have used comparative archival data.
Some studies have involved a replication of
US studies followed by an aggregate level
comparison of findings with US studies,
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

which precludes rigorous statistical testing.
As highlighted above, a criticism of these
studies is that they have not always undertaken data collection in the different countries
covered contemporaneously. This may lead
to potential issues of comparability if institutional environments change over time. However, offsetting this issue, these different
points of real time provide for some reduction
in the gap between the stage of development
of each market. Different data collection
methods may also be necessary where countries vary in their acceptability or feasibility
of particular approaches.
A further methodological issue is that
cross-country studies have typically drawn
their samples from the local VC association
membership. Outside North America, in particular, this membership is likely to include
both classic VC providers as well as private
equity providers. Interestingly, where studies
have introduced control variables in multiple
regressions for early versus late or MBO stage
investments, the coefficients on these dummy
variables has generally been insignificant (e.g.
Manigart et al. 2002; Wright et al. 2002, 2004b).
Nonetheless, research questions focusing on
cross-country comparisons of VC behaviour
may need to be more precise in relation to the
particular types of activity they are addressing: for example, investment stages. Researchers
may then need to select carefully from national
VC association directories only those venture
capitalists that relate to the focus of attention
in a particular study.
Many studies have been cross-sectional in
nature and therefore fail to capture the dynamic
nature of VC markets and emerging VC markets in particular. There is a need for more
longitudinal (i.e. repeat) survey data that identify the changing behaviour across markets.
There are some indications from different
authors that have examined the same phenomenon at different points in time that this is an
important area. For example, Farag et al.
(2004) find in their study of VC in CEE in
2002 that, in contrast to earlier work by Bliss
(1999), venture capitalists no longer adopted a
153

<-----Page 19----->International venture capital research
very informal approach to investing. Further
research might usefully consider whether
screening, information usage, valuation, monitoring and investment realization behaviour
converge to developed market norms as VC
markets develop or whether it is restricted by
institutional inertia. Such work could be
undertaken by using questionnaire instruments that have been used in developed market contexts and adapted for use in developing
or emerging markets.
Micro-level Crossing Borders

It is evident from our review that further
research is required to examine internationalization behaviour by venture capitalists. Also,
further aspects of the life cycle of venture
capitalists’ international investment activities
need to be analysed. In addition, there is a
need to examine whether, as in the manufacturing sector, this behaviour varies both
according to the country of origin of the VC
and the country into which they enter.
An important area for further research concerns the international structure of VC firms.
While some may be multinational and some
transnational, there is a lack of systematic evidence on the predominant organizational character. Further research needs to develop a
taxonomy of how different modes relate to
different types of VC firms based on different
investment objectives, resources, goals etc.
Additional analysis might also examine how
these modes are changing over time, and what
factors are influencing these changes. Relatedly, there is limited research on the behaviour of different organizational forms of VC in
terms of their international raising of funds
and their cross-border investment behaviour
and whether this behaviour varies between
countries. Since there are important differences between the organizational form of VC
firms between countries (Megginson 2004),
further research in this area seems warranted.
For example, how and why does the international structure differ between independent,
captive and corporate venture capitalists? Are
154

captive venture capitalists that are part of a
multinational or global network of offices
developed by their parents more likely to
adopt this form of internationalization? Are
independent venture capitalists more likely to
adopt a transnational form because of the
costs involved in establishing offices? Do any
differences between captive and independent
venture capitalists reflect differences in the
size and stages of deals being considered? Do
captive venture capitalists that internationalize
do so in a way that is constrained by or mimics
the internationalization structure of their parent,
or do they have the discretion to pursue their
own structure?
In the light of the paucity of research on
internationalization by venture capitalists, an
important issue concerns the development of
appropriate conceptual frameworks for analyzing the internationalization behaviour of
venture capitalists. Some appropriate frameworks for researching the internationalization
of venture capitalists can be considered, and
research into the internationalization of other
professional services firms (e.g. lawyers) may
provide additional insights. We suggest that
there is potential to synthesize core elements
of the international business (IB) literature
with that relating specifically to venture capitalists. In particular, we consider that there is
scope for further application of TCE and especially the RBV framework to the VC context
to help researchers to understand better the
nature and extent of international diversity,
entry mode and co-ordination and control of
foreign operations by venture capitalists. Further, core themes of the RBV, which include
path dependency, and the changing nature of a
firm’s resource base over time, can facilitate a
better understanding of the dynamics of venture capitalists’ internationalization behaviour.
We elaborate in what follows.
Traditionally, the dominant framework in
the study of the internationalization of firms
has been the stages model. In the stage model,
firms initiate market entry through exports via
independent representatives, and then by the
establishment of an overseas sales subsidiary
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 20----->September
(Johanson and Vahlne 1977, 1990; Johanson
and Wiedersheim-Paul 1990). Overseas production/manufacturing units are established
last in order. This model, however, has been
challenged in both the IB and entrepreneurship literature, since an important group of
firms internationalize at an early stage in their
development (Alavarez-Gil et al. 2003; Autio
et al. 2000; Delios and Henisz 2003; Oviatt
and McDougall 1994; Zahra et al. 2000).
The model provides a framework to consider
whether venture capitalists adapt their approaches to internationalization as they gain
more expertise but has shortcomings. Where
production cannot be separated from consumption, as in many services, and FDI and
licensing are the only available options, the
increased resource commitment involved in
adopting these modes may slow down the
process of internationalization (Buckley et al.
1992; Cardone-Riportella and Cazorla-Papis
2001; Erramilli 1991). At the same time, however, where there is high interaction between
producer and consumer during service delivery, incremental internationalization in business and financial services is problematic.
The transaction cost economics (TCE) perspective on internationalization focuses on
efficient organizational design. The resourcebased view (RBV) is a complementary theory
to TCE for investigating issues relating to the
internationalization of VC (Madhok 2002).
Whereas the focus of strategy under TCE is
efficient organizational design, the focus of
strategy under the RBV is the generation and
deployment of firm-specific resources in order
to create value. As such, the RBV has become
the dominant approach to investigating interfirm differences in strategic management (Barney et al. 2001; Hoskisson et al. 1999).
The RBV, both in its equilibrium and dynamic
conceptualizations (Lockett and Thompson
2001), has attractions for understanding the
internationalization behaviour of venture capitalists. From an equilibrium perspective, the
RBV emphasizes the idea that resource superiority is critical to overcoming the inherent
costs faced by firms when they internationalize
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

(Rugman and Verbeke 2002). Second, success
in international markets cannot be realized
if the assets firms possess are not ‘specific’,
that is, are widely available and can be disseminated at no cost (Combs and Ketchen
1999). Third, the RBV focuses on the role of
resource availability in influencing the diversity of markets and the form in which firms
conduct international business. From a dynamic
perspective, the RBV emphasizes the pathdependent processes of foreign knowledge
absorption and diffusion throughout internationalizing firms. Here, the focus is on disequilibria, continuous resource recombinations
and responses to requirements for realignment
with the different environments faced by firms
that internationalize (Teece et al. 1997). The
following sub-sections reflect on issues relating to the internationalization of venture
capitalists employing insights from both TCE
and RBV as well as research on other types of
professional service firm.
Nature of international diversity. Venture capitalists that possess more internationally experienced personnel (or human resources) may be
better equipped to cope with uncertainty and
contemplate entry into new markets (Johanson
and Vahlne 1977). As venture capitalists need
to maintain direct management contact in the
conduct of their post-investment activities,
whether monitoring investees or providing
value-added services, the need to maintain
direct contact suggests entry to markets in close
geographic proximity.
Evidence suggests that service firms (Westhead et al. 2001), and consulting firms in particular, may not undertake systematic analysis
of the international markets into which they
will enter (O’Farrell and Wood 1998; O’Farrell et al. 1995). Rather, their choice of market
may be constrained by their relationships with
clients or strategic partners, perhaps being
pulled abroad as a result of these associations.
We argue, however, that venture capitalists
may differ from these professional service
firms in that, while they may be called up to
advise existing portfolio firms to help them to
155

<-----Page 21----->International venture capital research
internationalize, the central part of venture
capitalists’ internationalization is to identify
opportunities to make investments in new
portfolio companies. This suggests a different
role for networks and social capital. Venture
capitalists that are rich in terms of resources
of internationally experienced personnel may
also be more likely to possess the diverse networks necessary for successful entry into different markets (O’Farrell and Wood 1994).
They may, therefore, be more likely to enter
into markets with long-established relationships, even if more distant and different
from those initially contemplated for entry
(Erramilli 1991). An important research question is, therefore, how and why do the networks and social capital of VC firms differ
from those of other professional service
firms? Directories of venture capitalists and
professional service firms are available internationally to identify populations on which to
base such studies.
As highlighted in the macro-analysis section, cross-country differences in the nature
and effectiveness of judicially enforced laws
and government-enforced regulations (La Porta
et al. 1998, 2000) as well as other institutional
factors, affect patterns of ownership and control, the development of financial markets and
the valuation of corporate assets. An important research question, therefore, is whether
venture capitalists with greater capabilities in
the processing and assessment of information
relating to environmental conditions are better
placed to enter diverse markets than their
counterparts?
Entry mode. Exporting (indirect or direct
through agents/distributors or sales subsidiaries/branches), contracting (licensing and
franchising, technical agreements, service/
management contracts and co-production agreements) and FDI (joint ventures (majority/
50–50/minority) and sole ventures with full
ownership and control (new or acquired
branch offices, wholly owned subsidiaries and
acquisitions)) represent the three generic
methods of penetrating foreign markets
156

(Buckley and Casson 1998; Buckley and
Ghauri 1993; Root 1994).
From a TCE perspective, entry mode
choice is viewed as a trade-off between control and the cost of resource commitments,
under conditions of risk and uncertainty
(Anderson and Gatignon 1986; Buckley and
Casson 1998). Internationalizing firms select
the entry mode that maximizes long-run
efficiency, and a distinction is made either
between a non-integrated and a fully integrated entry mode dichotomy in classifying
entry modes (Anderson and Gatignon 1986)
or a more fine-grained approach, depending
on different levels of ownership and control
(e.g. Delios and Henisz 2000). Brouthers and
Brouthers (2003) emphasize that, for service
firms, the transactions cost economics approach
suggests that the mode of entry will be driven
by people-oriented measures of uncertainty,
that is asset specificity, behavioural uncertainty and trust propensity. Service firms making high asset specificity investments and
investing in uncertain environments are likely
to prefer wholly owned modes of entry.
The transaction cost approach to entry
mode determination has been criticized on the
grounds that many firms do not proactively
choose their mode of entry into international
markets either because they lack the resources
or are drawn into internationalization through
their links with trading partners (O’Farrell
and Wood 1998; Westhead et al. 2001). Furthermore, we argue that the TCE approach
may also be limited in its applicability to
knowledge-intensive sectors such as VC. In
these sectors, competitive advantage may be
achieved by exploiting and augmenting the firm’s
knowledge as a key resource (Erramilli 1991;
Erramilli and Rao 1993). Using a resourcebased perspective on entry modes by venture
capitalists enables the analysis of research
questions such as: are venture capitalists that
attract more financial resources from their
investors better able to establish a physical
presence through offices, for instance, in foreign markets? Similarly, compared with their
counterparts that are constrained in terms of
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 22----->September
financial resources, are those venture capitalists that are larger in fund size able to acquire
other firms and hence enter foreign markets
through acquisitions?
Also, venture capitalists with less human
capital in the form of fewer internationally
experienced executives may require more time
to learn new roles and compete with existing
firms and well-established investee groups in
foreign markets (Buckley et al. 1992). This
raises the following research question. Do lower
human capital resources deter ownershipbased entry, leading VC firms into investing
in foreign markets at arm’s length, without
physically establishing themselves there?
Firms with more experienced executives may
have greater confidence to gauge investee
needs, estimate costs and returns, and assess
the true economic worth of foreign markets
(Erramilli 1991; Hill et al. 1990; O’ Farrell
and Wood 1994). Hence, are venture capitalists with more experienced executives more
likely to commit larger resources to foreign
market entry and establish themselves through
some form of physical presence?
In addition to resources being firm-specific,
resources may be specific to an industry and/
or specific to a location. Industry-specific
resources, however, are not necessarily locationspecific, it may be possible to transfer them
to different countries. For example, certain
professional services relating to computing,
engineering and consulting may require
proprietary knowledge that varies little with
location. Some VC firms may compete on the
basis of their specialist technological knowledge and therefore be less constrained by
location-specific knowledge and resources.
This raises the research question: do firms that
compete on this basis carry out cross-border
activities at arms’ length as their need to access
local knowledge is relatively low? Does this
differ as between later rather than earlier stage
deals? More specifically in relation to the
behaviour of venture capitalists, further
research is required to examine the deal generation activities involved in these approaches.
For example, to what extent do the arm’s
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

length versus physical location entry modes
involve different types of deal generation?
In contrast, in some professional services
industries there may be a need to access local
knowledge. For example, lawyers and accountants operating in different countries are likely
to need to acquire knowledge about local regulations and reporting mechanisms and therefore need to adapt to local conditions (O’Farrell
and Wood 1998). Some VC firms may need to
gauge local conditions about the regulatory
environment and link into networks to access
entrepreneurs involved in early stage ventures.
In this case, do VC firms adopt a high resource
access entry mode involving a local physical
presence or some link with local VC firms that
do have this knowledge? Chen et al. (2004)
find that Taiwanese VC firms entering the
Chinese market join forces with foreign venture capitalists who have the resources and
expertise. There is limited work on this aspect,
and more is required in different contexts.
Studies of internationalization by professional
service firms have developed methods and
instruments to address these issues in that
context, and these may be adapted to examine
the VC context.
Finally, the choice of entry mode may be
influenced by how the VC is seeking to compete and the venture capitalists’ organizational
form. We argue that captive venture capitalists
may be able to draw on their parent company
for more financial and financial-management
skills which may be less country specific and
may also be able to draw on their parent’s
international network for identifying deals.
Independent venture capitalists with stronger
managerial and operational skills, which are
more location specific, may be limited in their
access to funds and need to identify syndicate
partners for financial resources. Thus further
research could survey captive and independent venture capitalists to seek answers to the
question: do captive firms use local-resource
seeking entry modes while independent venture capitalists use low resource access modes?
These different bases for competition may
help to explain the observed different entry
157

<-----Page 23----->International venture capital research
modes by VC firms into foreign markets. Further research is required to explore this issue
empirically and could be carried out using surveys or interviews with senior venture capitalists responsible for policy development.
Forms of control of foreign activities. A key
strand in the internationalization literature
concerns firms’ choice between standardization and adaptation in the conduct of international operations (Bartlett and Ghoshal 1998).
Control of subsidiary operations through tight
linkages with the headquarters brings about
adherence to parent firms’ goals or targets, thus
making performance predictable (Cray 1984).
The need to accommodate diverse perspectives in multiple, new and complex entry modes
in different markets, however, may require
increased adaptation and responsiveness to
local market, regulatory and cultural conditions and also requires multiple modes of
people management (Doz and Prahalad 1986).
Venture capitalists that are large in terms of
financial resources may be more likely to rely
upon formal reporting mechanisms (Elango
et al. 1995). Parent VC firms internationalizing to foreign markets, therefore, may be
expected to impose formal reporting requirements on their counterparts in those markets.
Particularly vital in foreign markets may be
the information-processing and decisionmaking capabilities of experienced VC executives (Sapienza et al. 1996) based in the home
market. Firms that possess more firm-specific
knowledge and experience as embodied in
their human capital may, therefore, be more
likely to require more intensive and frequent
interaction with their counterparts overseas
(Edstrom and Galbraith 1977). The need to
overcome delays in decision-making and resolve
conflicts may necessitate reliance on informal
co-ordination procedures (Egelhoff 1993).
Venture capitalists that are generally small
in terms of the total number of people they
employ may find it easier to co-ordinate informally with their colleagues, without having
to resort to formal procedures in the course
of decision-making. Therefore, building on
158

this resource-based perspective, an important
research question concerns how firm-specific
knowledge and firm size affect the nature of
co-ordination of overseas VC activities.
A key dimension of venture capitalists’
competitive advantage relates to the way in
which they conduct their investment procedure (Wright and Robbie 1998). They may,
therefore, require formalized procedures to
transfer the capabilities inherent in their investment process. At the same time, however, VC
involves different types of knowledge, ranging
from strategic and financial to operational
expertise. The need to transfer and aggregate
expertise embodied in different people may call
for mutual adjustment and the use of horizontal communication channels, as, for example,
through scheduled and unscheduled meetings
(Barkema et al. 2002; Grant 1996; Malnight 2001;
Van De Ven and Delbecq 1976). Different stages
of the VC investment process, moreover, involve
considerable decision-making and search
processes (for deal seeking, for instance), all
of which entail uncertainty. Such uncertain
and unstructured management tasks may
increase the difficulty of co-ordination through
programming and standardization (Marschan
et al. 1996; Welch and Welch 1997). This
knowledge-based aspect of the resource-based
view raises the research question as to how the
need to deal with different forms of knowledge affects the co-ordination of overseas VC
activities. As this question involves examination of detailed processes, in-depth interviews
with executives in VC head offices and overseas activities may be an appropriate approach.
Conclusions

In this paper, drawing on studies in economics, finance, strategy, international business,
entrepreneurship and economic geography,
we have reviewed the literature relating to
international VC. We have shown that the
vast majority of this literature relates to crosscountry comparisons, at both macro and
micro levels. It is evident that major research
gaps exist in relation to work dealing with the
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

<-----Page 24----->September
international development of VC industries
and crossing of country borders by VC firms.
We conclude with seven broader comments.
First, our review has commented on the
research methodologies used to examine
international VC; in particular, the widespread
use of, and over-reliance on, cross-sectional
survey methods. We suggest that there is a
need for the development, and analysis of,
longitudinal data sets and an urgent need for
the development of archival data sets.
Second, and related to the first point, our
review of the literature indicates that crosscountry research (at both the macro and micro
level) has dominated research investigating
the international development of VC and
venture capitalists crossing borders. We consider that the dominance of cross-sectional
work may well be correlated with crosscountry studies. As a result, a shift in focus
towards investigating the development of
international VC and venture capitalists crossing borders should go hand in hand with a
shift towards longitudinal research.
Third, our review has taken a broad definition of VC. The vast majority of research
reviewed has not differentiated between different stages of VC investment, notably the
potential for differences between early and
late stage investments. This may be because
much of the international VC literature has
drawn on the US-based literature that tends to
focus on new ventures and to regard later
stage investments such as management buyouts as part of a distinct private equity market.
Internationally, however, there are major differences in the relative importance of early
and later stage investments and the two
aspects may typically be considered as part of
the overall VC market. These differences suggest variations in the factors that influence the
development of VC markets, VC investment
behaviour between markets and how firms
operate when they cross country boundaries.
For example, there may be important differences in informational asymmetries between
early and late stage investments that are moderated by institutional differences between
© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005

2005

countries. There may also be important differences in resource and capability requirements
to internationalize successfully, depending on
whether a VC firm is focused on early or later
stage investments. To date, there is limited
work that examines these distinctions. Notable exceptions are Jeng and Wells (2000), who
distinguish the factors influencing the development of early and later stage VC markets,
and Farag et al. (2004), who compare the
financial structuring, monitoring and exiting
behaviours of early and late stage VC investors in CEE and Germany.
Fourth, much of the cross-country and
crossing-border micro-level work has focused
on the behaviour of venture capitalists in relation to their investee portfolio companies.
That is, research has focused on comparing
either outflows of funds across different countries or outflows of funds internationally. There
has been little micro-level research that analyses issues relating to the inflows of funds
into VC funds either in terms of comparisons
across different countries or aspects of venture capitalists raising funds from different
countries. Further research is needed in this
area.
Fifth, in terms of the geographic coverage
of studies, there is unevenness in terms of the
balance of countries researched. To some
extent, this is a reflection of the recent growth
of new markets, with the number of firms in
some markets precluding quantitative analysis
of any kind. Research is now appearing on
CEE and Asian markets, but there is scope for
further development. Of particular need for
attention is the need to recognize that there
may be significant heterogeneity between
countries within a particular region so that the
grouping together of countries within a geographic region in an attempt to address sample size issues may be problematic.1
Sixth, our review adds to understanding of
the future potential for the globalization of
VC. Gompers and Lerner (2001) note that,
until recently, efforts to transplant the VC
model internationally were rare and that many
recent efforts to stimulate VC have met with
159

<-----Page 25----->International venture capital research
mixed success. They suggest that, for a VC
market to be successful, there is need for an
ample supply of promising new technologies,
a set of knowledgeable managers willing to
take risks, helpful regulatory and tax conditions, and robust markets in order to exit
investments. Where successful new VC markets such as Germany, India and Israel have
developed, these have spurred cultural, economic and regulatory changes that make continuing VC success in these markets likely.
The studies cited here particularly emphasize
the need to consider specific legal environments that influence VC and the influence of
social networks and cultures. Our review
leads us to agree only partially with the view
(see e.g. Megginson 2004) that a case for a
global market for VC and private equity is
emerging. Rather, it seems to us that important national differences remain and are changing only slowly, so that markets are likely to
remain nationally based. This has implications
for the international behaviour of venture
capitalists, suggesting a need to tailor entry
strategies to local market conditions.
Finally, and more generally, VC firms
present interesting avenues for developing the
IB research agenda. Recent debate has questioned the longevity of the IB research agenda
(Buckley 2002), suggesting that the big
research question in IB is no longer clear. He
indicates, however, that the interplay of
national cultures and organizational cultures
represents a research agenda with much life
left in it. These aspects may be applied to the
emergence of new institutions in the wake of
globalization. Buckley also suggests that one
of the future areas of focus for IB research is
to identify trends towards and away from globalization. Peng (2004) takes the debate further by arguing that research needs to focus
more on the factors that determine the international success and failure of firms. We suggest that the emerging internationalization of
VC represents the development of an important new institutional form with important
implications for the international prospects of
firms that are as yet little understood.

The nature of this problem is illustrated in the
wider context of the study by La Porta et al.
(1997, 1998) where there are considerable differences between countries with apparently similar
governance system in terms of regulatory variables and yet similarities between some countries
across governance systems.
