Abstract
In this article I develop a multi- and meso-level theory of grief recovery time from the loss of a family business. The multi-level
aspect of the model suggests how primarily micro theories of grief and sense-making can help explain grief recovery time at the
family group level. The meso-level aspect of the model provides insight into recovery from the loss of a family business by
proposing how grief dynamics interact at the individual level through emotional intelligence and the family group level through
emotional capability. By supplementing theories of grief with those of sense-making, the model provides a deeper understanding of
the grief recovery process. This model has implications for scholars and practical implications for family business members and the
family unit.

1. Executive summary
In this article I offer a multilevel, meso-level theory of grief recovery time after the loss of family businesses. The multiple
levels of grief recovery time are represented by the perspective of individuals in the form of emotional intelligence and by the
perspective of the family group in terms of emotional capability. More emotionally intelligent individuals are better able to
recognize and use their grief to process information about their loss and to help other members do the same. An emotionally
capable family has norms, routines and other capabilities for dealing with grief that, on the one hand express and evoke
emotions associated with the loss of the business, and on the other hand, avoid emotions associated with the loss and attend to
secondary causes of stress, and, in addition activate a necessary switch from one grief orientation to the other.
The meso-level aspect of the proposed model focuses on the behaviors that attend to the negative emotions
associated with loss (grief dynamics) and their impact on the dynamics of making sense of the loss of the family
business. I propose that these grief dynamics are important in understanding why some (individuals and family groups)
are able to make sense of the loss and recover from grief quickly while others cannot or are delayed in doing so.

The proposed model offers: 1) an explanation of how primarily micro theories of grief and sense-making (of
individuals) can help explain macro effects, namely, grief recovery time at the family group level, 2) a deeper
understanding of the grief recovery process, and 3) insight into recovery speed from the loss of a family business by
proposing how grief dynamics interact at the individual level through emotional intelligence and the family group level
through emotional capability.
Given the prominent role of family firms in today's economy, family business scholars have an opportunity to
provide a systems perspective to dealing with business loss; a contribution that is difficult for organizational scholars to
make because their research typically stops when the organization dies. At least for the study of group- and meso-levels
of recovery from the loss of a business, it appears highly appropriate for future research to focus exclusively on family
businesses. We know that families differ on a whole host of factors and these factors likely include the ability to make
sense of the loss of a family business and recover from it.
There are substantial challenges in developing a multi- and meso-level model on grief recovery from the loss of a
family business, especially given that this is a topic that does not yet have a sufficient body of research at either of the
levels of analysis. Indeed, it is premature to expect a multi- and meso-level theory of grief recovery from loss of a
family business to offer concrete propositions around a clearly defined, unambiguous boundary of the phenomenon.
But the purpose of this model was ambitious in scope to provide a context, and hopefully a motivation, for future
research on the emotions associated with business failure at the individual level, the family group level, and across
these levels. The fact that this topic has received such little scholarly activity represents, I believe, an opportunity for
theoretical and practical contributions. It is my hope, that over time we develop streams of research that can explain, at
least in part, why some more successfully recover from the negative emotional reaction to the loss of a failed business
than others. I believe that the practical implications of this could be considerable.
Family businesses represent up to 90% of all businesses in the United States (Dumas, 1992; Heck and Trent, 1999;
Kets de Vries, 1993) and may generate over 50% of US Gross Domestic Product (Dyer, 1986). Definitions of the
family business revolve around the kinship of family members and also mention family ownership, management by
family members, operational ownership of family members and family member involvement across generations (Heck
and Trent, 1999; Rogoff and Heck, 2003; Wortman, 1994).1 Indeed, it is this interaction between family members, the
family, and the business that is believed to be the unique set of features that can help explain performance differences
between family and non-family businesses (Chrisman et al., 2005; Habbershon et al., 2003). But inevitably, many of
these businesses fail or cannot attract the new debt or equity funding that is required to continue to operate under family
control and management. Kets de Vries (1993) asserts that 70% of family businesses fail to survive through the second
generation and 90% through the third generation. The effects of losing a family business can be hard felt by the
business' stakeholders and community, but especially by the family members themselves.
This loss can induce grief among those members — feelings of loss that trigger well-established psychological,
behavioral and physiological symptoms (Gross, 1998). Grieving can help people to recognize and accept the nature and
causes of their loss, even if it is fraught with intense feelings of confusion, aching, yearning and anger. But, the longer
that people experience grief after their loss, the more they experience anxiety, agitation, guilt, intrusive (uncontrolled
and unwanted) thoughts, yearning for what they have lost and depression (Prigerson et al., 1997). Prigerson and
colleagues (1997) showed that such symptoms are related to negative psychological and physiological outcomes, such
as depression and anxiety as well as heart disease, cancer and flu. It follows that faster recovery from grief over the loss
of the family business generally promotes the emotional and physical well being of individual family members and the
family unit as a whole; and so renders those individuals and group more productive. Grief recovery time refers to the
period it takes before thoughts about the events surrounding, and leading up to the loss of the business, no longer
generate a negative emotional response.
Despite the importance of being able to quickly recover from grief over the loss of a family business, there has been
little research on the topic. The one exception, to my knowledge, is Shepherd (2003) that investigated the
psychological consequences of business failure for self-employed individuals and proposed a dual process model to
enhance grief recovery. I build on this previous paper here by using a systems perspective to explore grief recovery
from business failure in a specific social context — the family business, which provides a deeper understanding about
grief mechanisms and outcomes at the family level as well as cross-level relationships in a way consistent with research
focused on the grieving individual. Although scholars of family business have used a systems perspective to investigate
1

For the purposes of this paper, family businesses are those that are founded, managed and predominantly owned by members of a family.

the inter-relationship between family members, the family, and the business to explain heterogeneity in firm
performance (e.g., Kirchhoff and Kirchhoff, 1987; Olson et al., 2003) and to explore tensions between the family and
business systems (Rosenblatt et al., 1985; Stafford et al., 1999), there has been little research that has investigated the
“performance” of one system (family: family members and the family unit) in coping with the loss of the other system
(the family business). Rather than focus on the causes of family business failure (e.g., File and Prince, 1996), I
investigate its consequences.
My multiple levels of grief recovery are represented by the perspective of individuals in the form of emotional
intelligence and by the perspective of the family group in terms of emotional capability. Emotional intelligence usually
refers to an individual's ability to “monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them
and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions” (Salovey and Mayer, 1990: 189; see also Goleman,
1995). I adapt this definition to my context to examine how this intelligence enables family members to transition from
a loss orientation towards the failed business to a restoration orientation and vice versa. More emotionally intelligent
individuals are better able to recognize and use their grief to process information about their loss and to help other
members do the same. Emotional capability refers to recognizing and regulating emotions, where recognizing emotions
refers to a group's ability to anticipate, differentiate, and understand the emotional experiences of its members and
regulating emotions refers to the groups conscious and unconscious efforts to manage felt and expressed emotions of
members so that the members' emotional experiences function in a manner that facilitate intellectual task performance
(Reus and Liu, 2004: 255–256; based on Huy, 1999). As I will elaborate, an emotionally capable family has norms,
routines and other capabilities for dealing with grief that, on the one hand express and evoke emotions associated with
the loss of the business, and on the other hand, avoid emotions associated with the loss and attend to secondary causes
of stress — it activates a switch from one grief orientation to the other.
The meso-level aspect of my theory focuses on the behaviors that attend to the negative emotions associated with
loss (grief dynamics) and their impact on the dynamics of making sense of the loss. I show that these grief dynamics are
important in understanding why some (individuals and family groups) are able to make sense of the loss and recover
from grief more quickly while others cannot or are delayed in doing so. Therefore, the purpose of the proposed theory is
to increase our understanding of grief recovery time by using a sense-making perspective to explore the role of
emotions at both the individual and group level and by linking these two levels using meso-level constructs as a bridge.
Specifically, I use emotional intelligence (Goleman, 1995; Salovey and Mayer, 1990) of individuals to understand why
some individuals are better able to manage grief in a way that enhances making sense of the loss and use emotional
capability (Huy, 1999) of groups to understand why some families are better able to make sense of the loss of their
business.
I believe that the paper makes three primary contributions. First, family businesses have been defined in terms of an
emotional kinship group (Carsrud, 1994) and studies have explained variance in their performance (Habbershon et al.,
2003; Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2004) including their failure (Miller et al., 2003; Winter et al., 2004). In this paper I
explore the emotions of family members and of the family unit to gain a deeper understanding of the time it takes to
recover from business failure. That is, my model begins where most explorations of organizational failure end. Second,
the advantages of scanning, interpreting and learning on making sense of past actions are well-established.
Explanations for why some are more effective at using these sense-making mechanisms have focused on the individual
(Blatt et al., 2006; Weick, 1979) or the organizational level (Daft and Weick, 1984; Maitlis and Lawrence, 2007) but
not both. In this paper I investigate sense-making in a specific context — family business failure — and offer grief
dynamics and emotional intelligence (at the family member level) and emotional capability (at the family unit level) to
explain why some engage in sense-making more effectively, that is, recover from grief more quickly. Crossing levels
provides an opportunity for a more fine-grained understanding of sense-making dynamics. Finally, the grief literature
has focused on the grief recovery process of individuals, while some studies have acknowledged the impact of
“significant others” on that process. In this paper, the model explicitly considers grief at an individual level, grief at a
group level, how a group's capabilities influence an individual's grief recovery speed, and how an individual's
capabilities can influence a group's grief recovery speed. The conjoint influence of capabilities at the individual and
group level on grief recovery time at both these levels provides additional insights to research at either level.
The article proceeds as follows. First, I use the literatures on sense-making to categorize the major stages of the
learning process at both the individual and group level. Second, I build on the definitions of grief dynamics (lossoriented, restoration-oriented, and transition oriented) and illustrate their relationship with the sense-making dynamics
(scanning, interpretation, and learning/action) and how this applies at both the individual and group level. I explore the

<-----Page 3----->84

impact that grief dynamics and sense-making dynamics have on grief recovery. Finally, I discuss the implications of the
model.
2. A meso- and multi-level model of recovering from grief over the loss of a family business
2.1. Link between the individual and family group levels: a meso-level perspective
A systems perspective is useful to highlight the link between a family group and its individual members. Following
Cox and Paley (1997) the link between the family group and its members can be characterized by three attributes. First,
the family is an organized whole and cannot be understood simply from the combined characteristics of its members
(Cox and Paley, 1997; Minuchin, 1988; Sameroff, 1994). Second, the family consists of subsystems (e.g., individuals,
dyads [such as spouses], nuclear families) embedded within the broader family group and interactions occur within and
across these levels (Minuchin, 1974). Third, the family can be adaptive to change by making coordinated changes in
the internal workings of the system and can regulate transactions with the environment while simultaneously
preserving the integrity of the family boundaries (Broderick, 1993; Minuchin, 1985). To understand this adaptive
function requires an investigation of both individuals and the family group (Hetherington, 1992; Parke, 1988).
A meso-level theory involves at least two levels of analysis — I am focusing on the individual and group (family)
levels — that are linked through bridging propositions that aggregate the effects of lower level variables and relate
them to higher level variables (cf., House et al., 1995; Huy, 1999). Such a perspective allows for the treatment of micro
and macro processes jointly and examine their interactions to provide a more comprehensive understanding (Huy,
1999) of the behavior in, and of, families facing the loss of their businesses and why some more quickly make sense of
the experience and recover from grief.
Fig. 1 illustrates my multilevel, meso-level model. At the individual level, the model suggests that an individual's
emotional intelligence is positively related to his or her ability to regulate grief over the loss of a family business in
order to make sense of the experience and speed grief recovery. A family member's grief recovery time is the period it

<-----Page 4----->D.A. Shepherd / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 81–97

85

takes before his or her thoughts about the events surrounding, and leading up to the loss of the family business, no
longer generate a negative emotional response. At the family level, the model suggests that a family's emotional
capability is positively related to its ability to regulate grief to make sense of the loss of a family business and speed the
grief recovery process. A family's grief recovery time is the period it takes before the family's recollections about the
events surrounding, and leading up to the loss of the family business, no longer generate a negative emotional response
at the family unit level. The more emotionally intelligent family members and the more emotionally capable a family
group, the speedier will be its grief recovery.
Specifically, linking the individual level models and family-group level models are two meso constructs: (1) grief
dynamics (e.g., loss orientation, restoration orientation, and transition orientation) and (2) sense-making dynamics
(e.g., scanning, interpreting, and learning). As illustrated in the figure, I propose that individuals and family groups
that enact these are able to use a loss orientation to improve aspects of the sense-making process (e.g., improve
scanning by focusing attention on critical information), a restoration orientation to improve aspects of the sensemaking process (e.g., by freeing up information processing capacity to enhance interpretation), and a transition
orientation so that a loss orientation or a restoration orientation are not used too long such that they negatively impact
the sense-making process (e.g., when loss-oriented dynamics focus information processing capacity on the grief
rather than the event then a switch to restoration-oriented dynamics will interrupt the destructive rumination cycle).
Grief dynamics and sense-making dynamics are meso constructs because they are equally applicable to family
members and the family group (see House et al., 1995). That is, grief dynamics are employed by both individuals
(Archer, 1999; Gross, 1999; Kübler-Ross, 1969; Stroebe and Schut, 1999) and families (Davies et al., 1986; Kissane
et al., 1996a,b, 1998) and families make sense of their experiences (See McCubbin et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 2000)
which are distinct from those of the individual family members (Patterson, 2002; Reiss, 1981).
In the following sections, I begin from the right hand side of the figure and move left, that is, I begin with the
dependent variable — grief recovery time, and then introduce sense-making and grief dynamics. I then propose the
relationship between sense-making and grief dynamics in explaining grief recovery time. Finally, I propose how the
emotional intelligence and emotional capability independently and then conjointly influence speed to grief recovery.
2.2. Family business failure, grief and grief recovery time
Grief typically occurs in response to the loss of something important (Archer, 1999). For most owner–managers
their business is important — it offers income (Baumol, 1990), independence (Douglas and Shepherd, 2002), and a
sense of satisfaction (Brigham and DeCastro, 2003). For family businesses, the business may be a context for family
activity and the embodiment of family pride and identity (Meyer and Zucker, 1989: 78). There also appears to be a
sense of obligation for family members to be stewards of the business for current family members and subsequent
generations (Dyer, 1992). The relationship between the business and the family seems inextricably linked (Aldrich
and Cliff, 2003), such that the failure of the business is likely to generate feelings of grief. For example, the loss of
the family business can challenge one's assumption of personal and family identity, which can be a highly traumatic
experience generating a negative emotional response (Janoff-Bulman, 1992).
There is likely to be variability in the level of initial grief generated by family business failure. First, grief is
greater over the loss of objects for which the individual has made sustained emotional “investments” (Jacobs
et al.,2000). Therefore, consistent with the endowment effect (Strahilevitz and Loewenstein, 1998), family
members' grief is likely greater over the failure of family businesses that have existed for an extended period (over
generations) and those that have required personal effort. Second, grief is often greater for sudden, unexpected losses
(Kubitz et al., 1989). Therefore, family businesses that fail rapidly or are unexpectedly are likely to cause family
members to experience greater grief. Third, recent, multiple losses can result in an accumulation of grief (Nord,
1996). As such, a family business that occurs after a series of other personal failures will likely lead to higher levels
of grief. Finally, the more importance attached by an individual to the object lost, the greater the level of grief
(Archer, 1999). For example, when the family business forms an important part of an individual's (and family's)
identity, then its failure is likely to generate higher levels of grief.
Although a fine-grained investigation of the antecedents to the level of grief triggered by business failure is an
interesting research question, the purpose of this research is to begin with a level of grief and explain why some
family members and some families are able to recover from grief more quickly. Making sense of failure appears to be
an important step to such an explanation.

2.3. Making sense of failure
The importance of making sense of loss has been argued for at the individual (Janoff-Bulman, 1992) and family
group level (Nadeau, 2001). For example, Parkes and Weiss (1983) argued that bereaved widows must establish a
rationale for their loss and make sense of it if they are to recover successfully. Similarly, Nadeau (1998) explores the
healing process of a family that has had a family member die and uses interviews and analysis to demonstrate the
importance of families coming to terms with their grief and making sense of their loss. An emphasis on sense-making is
also apparent in the literature on other traumatic life events (Affleck and Tennen, 1996; Bulman and Wortman, 1977;
Silver et al., 1983). Sense-making is an interpretive process in which people assign meanings to occurrences (Gioia and
Chittipeddi, 1991) and involves ongoing interpretation in conjunction with action (Thomas et al., 1993; Bradley,
2002). Therefore, an understanding of why some (individuals and groups) are better able to manage the negative
emotions associated with the loss of a family business starts with an investigation of the major sense-making stages,
especially as it relates to interpreting loss experiences.
The sense-making process consists of the dynamics of scanning, interpretation, and learning (Gioia and Chittipeddi,
1991; Thomas et al., 1993; Weick, 1979). Scanning dynamics refer to the selective attention to, and collection of,
information that might be important in the sense-making process. Interpretation dynamics refer to the development of
ways of comprehending the meaning of information by fitting information into structures suitable for understanding
(Gioia, 1986; Taylor and Crocker, 1981). Learning dynamics refer to any significant changes in ongoing practices
(Ginsberg, 1988; Thomas et al., 1993) and involves actions taken (Daft and Weick, 1984).
The sense-making dynamics are highly interrelated and learning provides a feedback to scanning and interpretation
(there is reciprocal interaction). For example, scanning dynamics provide the information necessary for interpretation
(Daft and Weick, 1984; Dutton and Duncan, 1987; Hambrick, 1982), interpretation frames the information to mobilize
action in a specific direction (Bartunek, 1984; Dutton et al., 1983; Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991), and the action(s) taken
resulting from learning impacts subsequent scanning and interpretations (Daft and Weick, 1984).
Although this process of sense-making is typically investigated at the individual level, groups can also be
considered interpretive systems (Daft and Weick, 1984; Dutton and Duncan, 1987). For example, Thomas and
colleagues (1993) investigated 156 hospitals using path analysis to test the direct and indirect effects among the sensemaking dynamics and organizational performance outcomes. Therefore, sense-making dynamics are applicable at the
individual and group levels. Next I investigate the emotion-attending behaviors reacting to business failure that I call
grief dynamics.
2.4. The grief dynamics
Foundational works on grief discussed the idea of stages (e.g., Bowlby, 1961). The most influential was that of KüblerRoss (1969) that introduced five stages that individuals go through as part of the grieving process: 1) denial, 2) anger, 3)
bargaining, 4) depression, and 5) acceptance. Over the last few decades scholars have built on these foundational works to
overcome objections related to the notion of a sequential and “normal” progression through stages of grief by proposing a
Dual Process Model of coping with loss (e.g., Stroebe and Schut, 1999). In this article I build on these recent advancements
as well as recent work on grief over business failure (Shepherd, 2003).
Specifically, I classify different grief dynamics, namely, loss-oriented, restoration-oriented, or transition oriented.
Loss-oriented dynamics are those that confront the loss, revisit the events before and at the time of the death, and
“work through” (process) some aspect of the loss experience (Shepherd, 2003; Stroebe and Schut, 1999). For example,
loss-oriented dynamics would involve the family thinking back and reflecting on its relationship with the business —
the day the business opened its doors to customers, the celebrations when the business landed its first big deal, the
feelings of satisfaction from receiving customers' letters praising product quality — and of the events surrounding its
failure — losing the major client, realizing that the business was not going to survive, telling employees, customers,
and investors that the business was going to close, and turning the key to lock the business's doors for the last time.
Loss-oriented dynamics would also include seeking out friends to “talk through” one's grief.
Restoration-oriented dynamics of grief are those that offer a distraction from thoughts related to the loss and those
that focus on addressing secondary causes of stress (Archer, 1999; Shepherd, 2003; Stroebe and Schut, 1999). After
loss of a family business, restoration dynamics could involve undertaking activities that distract one's thoughts to avoid
thinking about the loss of the family business — playing sport, odd jobs around the house, and playing with the

<-----Page 6----->D.A. Shepherd / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 81–97

87

children — but also taking actions to reduce factors that contribute to stress that arose primarily from the loss of the
family business — selling the house, looking for a job, consolidating bank accounts, etc.
Transition oriented dynamics are those that shift one's orientation from loss-oriented dynamics to restorationoriented dynamics and vice versa. Both loss-oriented and restoration-oriented grief dynamics are likely to have different
costs — loss-oriented dynamics are physically and mentally exhausting whereas restoration-oriented dynamics involve
suppression, which requires mental effort and presents potentially averse consequences for health (Archer, 1999).
Oscillation between the loss and restoration dynamics enables a person to obtain the benefits of each and to minimize the
costs of maintaining one for too long speeding the recovery process (Shepherd, 2003; Stroebe and Schut, 1999). For
example, a family member might recognize that he or she has spent too long avoiding thoughts about the business's
failure and seeks out another member of the family that is willing to talk about the events leading up to the loss of the
business and their emotional reactions to it. Such an activity reflects a desire to shift from one dynamic to another.
3. Grief dynamics, sense-making, and grief recovery time
3.1. Grief and scanning for information
Grief signals the importance of the loss event (and those events leading up to it) and thereby directs attention to
those events for the purpose of scanning for significant information. In a similar way, stress results from the appraisal
that something important is at stake and is in jeopardy (Luce, Bettman and Payne, 1997) and this signaling can be
adaptive and improve coping by directing attention (Clore, 1992; Schwarz and Clore, 1988; Weick, 1990) and
resources to the event (Pieters and van Raaij, 1988). For example, emotional events receive higher priority in scanning
and processing information than do those that are neutral (Ellis et al., 1971; cf. Ellis and Ashbrook, 1988, 1989).
Restoration orientation involves distracting oneself from thoughts about the loss of the family business, the purpose of
which is to reduce negative emotions that are generated when thoughts are focused on the loss. This diverting of
attention from the loss will engage scanning for purposes other than making sense of the loss.
In contrast, a loss orientation initially focuses scanning activities on the loss by revisiting the events before and at the
time of the failure of the family business. However, after extended use a loss orientation's focus on information from
events leading up to the loss will likely shift to the emotions of the event (Stroebe and Schut, 1999). Such attention
focused on the emotions can further increase grief (Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema et al.,
1994) and direct attention away from scanning for information necessary to make sense of the loss. For example,
negative affect over financial losses has been found to cause a narrowing of (Gladstein and Reilly, 1985; Staw et al.,
1981; Sutton and D'Aunno, 1989), or interference with (Mogg et al., 1990), one's scanning for information. Transition
oriented dynamics shift orientations from a loss to a restoration orientation to distract thoughts about the loss of the
family business and reduce negative emotions and then back to a loss orientation to scan for information about the
reasons for the loss. Thus,
Proposition 1. (a) Increased scanning for information about the loss of a family business, speeds grief recovery.
(b) Greater use of restoration-oriented dynamics decreases scanning.
(c) Greater use of loss-oriented dynamics increases scanning, but an extended use of loss-oriented dynamics
decreases the scanning of information about the loss of the family business.
(d) The use of transition oriented dynamics will increase scanning when the continued use of loss-oriented dynamics
(or restoration dynamics) starts to detract from this sense-making mechanism.
3.2. Grief and interpretation of information
Restoration orientation, by channeling thoughts to issues not associated with the loss, can reduce the negative
emotional response from that event (Cuisner et al., 1996; Shuchter, 1986). In doing so, it reduces the emotional
interference to information processing. Although distracting oneself from thoughts of the events surrounding the loss
are effective in initially reducing negative emotions, these thoughts and feelings typically rebound (Wegner and Erber,
1993) interfering with the ability to make sense of the loss. Furthermore, information processing capacity may be used
in the distracter task to which attention is now focused, which reduces that available to process and interpret
information about the business failure.

<-----Page 7----->88

D.A. Shepherd / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 81–97

Working through aspects of grief using a loss orientation allows individuals to change the way that an event is
interpreted (for the loss of a loved one see Stroebe and Schut, 1999), which can allow emotions to be regulated so that
thoughts of the event no longer (or to a lesser extent) generate negative emotions (Gross, 1999). Increased
interpretation of information arises from finding more effective ways of comprehending the meaning of information by
better fitting information into information structures suitable for understanding. For example, finding an analogy to the
events leading up to the family business's failure may enhance interpretation (for connection between analogy and
learning see Gentner and Holyoak, (1997) and Markman and Gentner (2001)). Reducing negative emotions helps “free
up” information processing capacity, which further aids the interpretation of scanned information (Weick, 1990; cf.
Fineman, 1996; Frank, 1993; Hirshleifer, 1993; De Sousa, 1987).
However, the extended use of a loss orientation can increase feelings of grief because continued focus on the event
makes negative thoughts more accessible and salient (Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1995). Further, a loss
orientation can lead to ruminations. Ruminations are passive and repetitive focusing on one's symptoms of distress and
the circumstances surrounding these symptoms. To the extent that negative emotions are reinforced by a loss
orientation or diverted from the event to the emotions generated from the event, scarce information processing capacity
is consumed (Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1995; Weick, 1990; see Gladstein and Reilly 1985 for a group level
analysis) which in turn, increases the length and severity of emotional distress (Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema,
1993, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991) and diminishes one's ability to both solve
problems (Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991) and learn from the event (Bower, 1992). Transitioning from a loss to a
restoration orientation provides an opportunity to break the cycle of rumination and restore information processing
capacity for a transition back to a loss orientation for further processing of information about the loss of the family
business. Thus,
(a) Increased interpretation of information about the events surrounding the loss of a family
business, speeds grief recovery.
(b) Greater use of restoration-oriented dynamics initially increases but eventually decreases interpretation.
(c) Greater use of loss oriented dynamics initially increases but eventually decreases interpretation.
(d) The use of transition oriented dynamics will increase interpretation when the continued use of loss-oriented
dynamics (or restoration dynamics) starts to detract from this sense-making mechanism.

Proposition 2.

3.3. Grief and learning
Learning and subsequent actions are primarily influenced by loss and restoration orientations indirectly through
scanning and interpretation dynamics. After the failure of the business, the negative emotional reaction is likely to be
high. As discussed above, these emotions interfere with the scanning, interpretation and, consequently, learning from
the events surrounding the loss. A restoration orientation offers a respite from thinking about the loss by taking actions
that reduce secondary causes of stress, such as applying for jobs to provide financial support for the family. Such tasks
distract one's thoughts from the loss event diminishing negative emotions and “freeing up” information processing
capacity (Cuisner et al., 1996; Shuchter, 1986) for sense-making purposes. Furthermore, these restoration actions can
reduce stress and enhance learning. Reducing secondary causes of stress may reduce the emotional significance of the
primary stressor (cf Archer, 1999) — the loss of the family business — and the action itself may provide new data that
is a source of learning (Daft and Weick, 1984). However, these indirect sources of learning are soon exhausted and
emotions can typically only be suppressed for a certain period before they begin to resurface (Wegner and Erber, 1993).
The surfacing of previously suppressed emotions can have negative psychological and physical health consequences
(Archer, 1999), that can interfere with learning (Bower, 1992).
A loss orientation does not suppress emotions by distracting oneself from the loss event, rather it focuses the family
member's (or family's) attention on scanning and interpreting information about the events surrounding the loss to
learn from the experience. However, after extended use, a loss orientation will likely generate ruminations that diminish
the ability to learn and act. For example, individuals grieving a loss who engage in ruminations spend much of their
time thinking about how badly they feel and pondering questions like “Will I ever feel better?” and “Why am I such a
mess?” and do not act to relieve their symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1994). Furthermore, and as argued before, the
loss of a family business can threaten an individual's very identity (and under these circumstances a loss orientation

<-----Page 8----->D.A. Shepherd / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 81–97

89

makes the threat more salient). Threat rigidity scholars have found that people or organizations that feel threatened are
more likely to cling to well-learned responses even in the face of declining performance (Cameron et al., 1987a,b;
Hirschhorm and Associates, 1983; Nystrom and Starbuck, 1984). Therefore, little is learned and little is changed.
Both loss-oriented and restoration-oriented dynamics are likely to have different costs — loss-oriented dynamics are
physically and mentally exhausting that consumes information processing capacity necessary for sense-making
whereas restoration-oriented dynamics involve emotion suppression, which requires mental effort and presents
potentially averse consequences for health (Archer, 1999) and learning when they resurface. Using transition dynamics
to oscillate between loss and restoration dynamics enables a person and/or group to obtain the learning benefits of each
and to minimize the costs of maintaining one for too long speeding the recovery process (Shepherd, 2003; Stroebe and
Schut, 1999). Thus,
Proposition 3. (a) Learning from the events surrounding loss of a family business, speeds grief recovery.
(b) Greater use of restoration-oriented dynamics initially increases but eventually decreases learning.
(c) Greater use of loss-oriented dynamics initially increases but eventually decreases learning.
(d) The use of transition oriented dynamics will increase learning when the continued use of loss-oriented dynamics
(or restoration dynamics) starts to detract from this sense-making mechanism.
3.4. Emotional intelligence and emotional capability
Most of the literature on grief has focused on an individual's actions to recover from grief (Archer, 1999; Stroebe
and Schut, 1999). However, social interaction has been found to be important in understanding why some people are
able to make sense of loss and why others cannot or take longer to do so. For example, when a person faces a major
loss they typically want to talk about their loss and the emotions surrounding that loss — a loss orientation (Lepore,
1997; Lepore et al., 1996; Pennebaker, 1989, 1995). Although a social network can help a person “work through”
his or her grief and make sense of the failure (for reviews see Pennebaker, 1989, 1993), they do not always help the
griever make sense of the loss (Herbert and Dunkel-Schetter, 1992; House, 1981; Rook, 1984). For example, they
may say or do something that increases, rather than decreases, negative emotions slowing grief recovery (House,
1981; Lehman et al., 1986; Thoits, 1982). People can become tongue tied for fear of saying the wrong thing and
therefore deliver the message in an awkward way or say nothing to avoid creating problems (Nolen-Hoeksema and
Davis, 1999).
When looking for someone to talk to about a major loss and/or the negative emotions surrounding that loss, people
typically turn to family members (Rimé, 1995). However, with the death of a loved one, family members (the person's
social network) are themselves also grieving over this loss and therefore some families' members may be less inclined
to provide others support and less inclined to ask for emotional support for fear of exacerbating the grief of others
(Vachon and Stylianos, 1988).
An emotionally intelligent family member is aware of his or her own, and others, likely emotional response to
specific grief dynamics. For example, if this individual feels the need to engage in loss-oriented grief dynamics, e.g.,
talking about the events leading up to the business's failure, then they will know which family members will be able to
accommodate his or her need and who might also benefit from the joint loss-oriented behavior. This emotionally
intelligent individual will also know when he or she needs to transition from loss-oriented dynamics to restorationoriented dynamics (e.g., going to a ball game or a musical show) and which members of the family prefer this approach
and/or those members who also need to make this transition.
Although most of the research on grief has focused on the individual as the unit of analysis, research has
acknowledged its existence at the family group level (Clark and Goldney, 1995; Nadeau, 1998; Walsh and
McGoldrick, 1991). Patterson (2002) proposed that coping dynamics can occur from individual family members and
the family unit. An emotionally capable family group has norms and/or routines that have developed over time for
dealing with the negative emotions associated with an event that directly impacts the family group. For example, the
death of a family member would likely generate grief at the family group level and the norms and routines
established to deal with these past negative emotions may provide the family group the capability of dealing with,
and making sense of, the loss. Indeed families have demonstrated capabilities consistent with emotional capability —
e.g., expressions of feelings of grief (Davies et al., 1986; Kissane et al., 1996a) consistent with a loss orientation and
avoidance of grief (Kissane, 1994) consistent with a restoration orientation2 — and differences in emotional

<-----Page 9----->90

D.A. Shepherd / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 81–97

capabilities help explain variance in the family's recovery outcomes (Edwards and Clarke, 2004; Kissane et al.,
1996a,b, 1998). Thus:
Proposition 4. A family member that is more emotionally intelligent is more effective at using grief dynamics (loss,
restoration, and transition) to make sense of the loss of his or her family business and thereby speed grief recovery.
Proposition 5. A family that is more emotionally capable is more effective at using grief dynamics (loss, restoration,
and transition) to make sense of the loss of its business and thereby speed grief recovery.
3.5. Emotional intelligence/capability and grief recovery time across levels
Harmonious integration is a necessary condition for meso-level constructs (Huy, 1999). For harmonious
integration, it is necessary to recognize that individuals can use their emotional intelligence to further their selfinterests at the expense of the group, which could generate feelings of mistrust and conflict at the family group level.
For example, in order to divorce oneself from the anguish associated with thinking about the loss of the family
business an emotionally intelligent individual may withdraw from the family group to speed their own recovery but
delay that of others and reduce the emotional capability of the family group. It is also necessary to acknowledge that
people grieve and cope with grief differently and that these differences could be a source of disharmony in the family
group. For example, some individuals may prefer a loss orientation and talk about the grief that they feel whereas
another family member may prefer to avoid thinking about the business failure — these two people working in
concert may be a source of disharmony where neither receives the sort of emotional support they need. Indeed,
Jordan, Kraus and Ware (1993) identified the development of conflict within families around differences in coping
styles.
The different levels of grief and different coping styles do not necessarily mean that disharmony will result, rather it
represents the upside potential of diversity if harmony can be reached. For example, grief recovery is likely to be
particularly slow (and even problematic) when family members spend too long using a particular grief dynamic.
Diversity highlights the need for, and provides a mechanism to transition from one grief orientation to another. The
extent to which diversity can be harmoniously used to speed grief recovery is a reflection of emotional intelligence,
emotional capability, and the interaction of the two.
The above propositions have highlighted the role of emotional intelligence on a family member's grief recovery and
the role of emotional capability on a family's grief recovery, but a meso- and multi-level theoretical approach provides
the opportunity to explore cross-level relationships. It appears that emotional intelligence and emotional capability
likely enhance each other in speeding grief recovery. From a systems perspective of the family, it is acknowledged that
individuals contribute to the family system and are affected by it (Schoka Traylor et al., 2003; Shapiro, 2001). Scholars
of bereavement and grief noted that grieving family members are influenced by and, in turn, influence the grief of other
members (Block, 1991).
The family influences its members. Indeed the family systems perspective asserts that “any individual family
member is inextricably embedded in the larger family system and can never be fully understood independent of the
context of that system (Kreppner and Lerner, 1989; Minuchin, 1985; Sameroff, 1994)” (Cox and Paley, 1997: 246).
The family provides resources for its members (Minuchin, 1974) and in times of significant loss those resources are
captured by emotional capability. For example, less emotionally supportive families appear to adversely affect its
family members' abilities to cope and achieve positive recovery outcomes (Edwards and Clarke, 2004; Keitner and
Miller, 1990). Kissane and colleagues (1996a) found that in a sample of 115 adult families after the death of a parent, a
hallmark of the adaptive families were those that allowed (or encouraged) its members to be intimate with each other,
share their distress and feelings honestly, tolerate negative emotions, and provide mutual support.
The resources available from the emotional capability of the family still need to be drawn upon and effectively used
by the family member to speed his or her grief recovery. Family members with greater emotional intelligence are likely
more effective at knowing where to find these resources and how and when to use them. An emotionally intelligent
family member likely enhances the positive relationship between emotional capability and family level outcomes. For
example, an emotionally capable family has family codes that direct members to fulfill different roles (Minuchin, 1985;
Kissane (1994) does not propose avoidance as a beneficial grief mechanism (rather, the maladaptive consequences of being “stuck in a
restoration orientation”) but does demonstrate that families can avoid thinking about loss.

91

Sameroff, 1994) and the benefits of that capability for the family unit is likely enhanced when a member is more
emotionally intelligent; behaviors of this family member likely impact and change family behavior (Schoka Traylor
et al., 2003). Thus:
Proposition 6. The positive relationship between a family member's emotional intelligence and his or her speed to
grief recovery is enhanced for those in a more emotionally capable family.
Proposition 7. The positive relationship between a family's emotional capability and its speed to grief recovery is
enhanced for those families with more emotionally intelligent members.
4. Discussion
In this article I developed a multi- and meso-level theory of grief recovery from loss of a family business. It
suggests how primarily micro theories of grief and sense-making (of individuals) can help explain macro effects,
namely, grief recovery at the family group level. By complementing theories of grief with those of sense-making, the
model provides a deeper understanding of the grief recovery process. The meso-level aspect of the model provides
insight into recovery from loss of a family business by proposing how grief dynamics interact at the individual level
through emotional intelligence and the family group level through emotional capability. The cross-level aspect of the
model investigates the contingent relationship of emotional intelligence and emotional capability on grief recovery
for both the family member and the family group. In the next three sub-sections I offer some possible implications for
scholars and conclude with potential practical implications.
4.1. Research on the family group when businesses fail
Using the family business as the underlying phenomenon for developing a model of recovering from business
failure allowed me to theorize about grief recovery at the group as well as the individual level because the family
group remains even though the business is lost. Therefore, subsequent empirical investigations of the family group
and its activities after business failure can make an important contribution to Harris and Sutton's (1986) exploration
of group related activities given that groups of (former) employees typically disband soon after that of the death of a
non-family business. Given the prominent role of family firms in today's economy and the use of a systems
perspective to explore family business performance, family business scholars have an opportunity to provide a
systems perspective to dealing with business failure; a contribution that is difficult for organizational scholars to
make because they rarely distinguish between family and non-family businesses; yet a contribution that is important
theoretically and practically. At least for the study of group- and meso-levels of recovery from business failure, it
appears highly appropriate for future research to focus exclusively on family businesses. We know that families differ
on a whole host of factors and these factors likely include the ability to make sense of loss of a family business and
recover from it.
To empirically investigate my model requires a sample of failed family businesses and data collected at the family
member and family unit levels of analysis. This is easier said than done. Creating a longitudinal database is a
difficult undertaking made all the more difficult by attempting to collect data from people in despair. Our challenge
is not unique, however, because most empirical investigations of grief share many of the same challenges. Along
with sharing challenges, there is an opportunity to share measures by starting with existing measures and adapting
them to this new context. There are existing measures of grief over the loss of a loved one (e.g., the Hogan Grief
Reaction Checklist [Hogan et al., 2001]) that could be adapted to the loss of a family business. There are also
empirical studies that have investigated the extent to which individuals are using a loss (e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema and
Morrow, 1991) or a restoration orientation (e.g., Weinberger et al., 1979). Using adapted versions of these
orientations over a period of time provides the opportunity to capture oscillation between these orientations and how
it is done (capturing transition oriented dynamics). Establishing this measure of transition oriented grief dynamics
will likely make a substantial contribution to the family business and grief literatures. Sense-making is already well
established in both the organizational and grief literatures and existing measures capture the key aspects of this
process: scanning (Sawyerr, 1993), interpretation (e.g., Denison et al., 1996; Wagner and Gooding, 1997) and
learning (e.g., Diehl and Sterman, 1995; Goodman, 1998). There is no doubt that testing this model is a challenge
but for those who do, I believe that it will form the basis of an important contribution to a number of literatures.

4.2. Implications for research on the regulation of emotions
It appears that individuals differ in their emotional intelligence, that is, differ in their emotional self-awareness and
their ability to self-regulate those emotions (Grandey et al., 2005; Williams, 2003) — and as such, family members are
likely to vary in their effectiveness at managing the grief recovery process. Thus, even if everyone who experienced
grief was aware of the benefits of the different grief dynamics, there is likely to be heterogeneity in their ability to
implement it; those that have lower emotional self-awareness are less able to effectively self manage the transitions
from one grief orientation to the other and for those that are emotionally self-aware, implementing grief dynamics may
still be problematic if they have a low ability to self-regulate those emotions. The prescription of this model is that
making sense of the loss of a family business is enhanced by effective implementation of the grief dynamics, which in
turn is dependent upon individuals developing emotional intelligence and the family group developing emotional
capability.
Entrepreneurs have opportunities to improve their emotional intelligence. First, although there is dispute over the
definition of emotional intelligence and what it incorporates (Ashkanasy and Daus, 2005), there are acceptable
working definitions that involve the ability to read emotions in one's self and in others, and to be able to use this
information to guide decision making (Mayer and Salovey, 1997), and that it can be taught in leadership classes
(Ashkanasy and Dasborough, 2003) in accounting (McPhail, 2004), in negotiations (Ogilvie and Carsky, 2002), and so
forth. The formative body of research on emotional intelligence suggests that the self-awareness and self-regulation of
emotion can be taught.
Second, there is little research on the development of emotional capability, but the research on emotional
intelligence being learned by individuals provides some hope that groups may indeed be able to develop emotional
capability. Third, education may play an important role in helping entrepreneurs develop better understanding and
regulation of their negative emotions, such as grief. Shepherd (2004) proposed that emotional management should be
taught in the classroom, offered suggested changes to pedagogy to help students manage the emotions of learning from
failure, and explored possibilities in educating students more broadly on how to manage their emotions to avoid failure
and, more generally, improve their emotional intelligence and how to enhance the emotional capability of an
organization.
4.3. Implications for scholars of business failure
Although there has been considerable research on why organizations fail (e.g., Romanelli, 1989; Shepherd et al.,
2000), and processes during organizational decline (e.g., Barker and Mone, 1998; D'Aunno and Sutton, 1992; Ocasio,
1995) including the emotional response to decline (Sutton, 1987), there has been little research on the death of
organizations and post-death experiences. One interesting exception was the work by Harris and Sutton (1986) in their
investigation of parting ceremonies at the time of the death of an organization — a parting ceremony is a formal social
event that arises in response to the imminent breaking of social bonds (p. 6).
There is considerable commonality between parting ceremonies and the relationships between grief dynamics and
sense-making proposed in this article. We agree that organizations die, that the death represents the loss of something
important, people are likely to have a negative emotional response to that loss, that there will be mourning, and that
emotional support and the editing of schema can be beneficial. Harris and Sutton's (1986) investigation of the parting
ceremony for displaced workers occurred at a group level, it is likely that this group will eventually diminish or
disappear, therefore its implications were primarily at the individual level. But what is clear, is that the group level is
worthy of scholarly attention. It appears that the group can influence the effectiveness of an individual's grief recovery
process (and vice versa), and that group actions can influence group recovery. The importance of the group has only
recently gained prominence in the bereavement literature. However, management and entrepreneurship scholars have
developed considerable expertise in understanding group dynamics that could be highly beneficial in further
developing our understanding of the group's role in recovery from business failure.
5. Conclusion
There are substantial challenges in developing a multi- and meso-level model on grief recovery from the loss of a
family business, especially given that this is a topic that does not yet have a sufficient body of research at either of

<-----Page 12----->D.A. Shepherd / Journal of Business Venturing 24 (2009) 81–97

93

the levels of analysis. Indeed, it is premature to expect a multi- and meso-level theory of grief recovery from loss of
a family business to offer concrete propositions around a clearly defined, unambiguous boundary of the
phenomenon. But the purpose of this model was ambitious in scope to provide a context, and hopefully a
motivation, for future research on the emotions associated with business failure at the individual level, the family
group level, and across these levels. The fact that this topic has received such little scholarly activity represents, I
believe, an opportunity for theoretical and practical contributions. It is my hope, that over time we develop streams
of research that can explain, at least in part, why some more successfully recover from the negative emotional
reaction to the loss of a failed business than others. I believe that the practical implications of this could be
considerable.
At the individual level, entrepreneurs that experience failure might be better able to regulate emotions and recover
from grief more quickly so that for a shorter period of time they suffer the mental anguish and the negative
physiological outcomes of grief. A key to this is likely the family, especially when involving the loss of a family
business. Perhaps our future body of research will enable families to develop coping skills that can help speed grief
recovery for its members and the family unit. My proposed model here certainly does not lead to these practical
implications but hopefully provides multiple avenues for future research that scholars, motivated by the practical
implications, can make both theoretical and empirical contributions.
