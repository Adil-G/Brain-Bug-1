Abstract
Everyday we cross paths with many people, forming perceptions of trustworthiness based solely
from one’s initial appearance. This perception of trust is driven from the nonverbal messages
conveyed from other’s clothing and facial images, including one’s hair and makeup. Based on
four FORTUNE magazine images of America’s top fortune 500 company CEOs, this study
discusses how the level of trust is affected by the initial nonverbal presence of another. Based on
the Attribution Theory and Individualized Trust Scale (Wheeless & Grotz 1977) a total of 60
participants were recruited for this study. Results indicate insignificance between dress and
trust.

The Impact of Appearance on Perceptions of Trustworthiness.
An old adage states that looks can be deceiving. And although old, the adage still holds
true today. As a society we stereotype individuals based on the initial presence of appearance.
We form impressions of character and personality traits. Based on those formed impressions
prominent factors are distinguished during the initial presence.
One of the most prominent factors during initial presence is the willingness of individuals
to trust others. Individualized trust is a cognitive process of holding certain relevant, favorable
perceptions of another person which produce at the initial moment of perception (Wheeless &
Grotz, 1997). At the initial moment of perception many appearance factors determine the level of
trust. Clothing, facial expressions, hair, and even makeup are important elements that have
received much attention from researchers. Various researchers have indicated that people have a
high expectancy of trustworthiness due to the variable of appearance. There is a possibility that if
one forms a certain level of trust based solely on appearance, it will increase the overall
perception of trustworthiness of the individual. Today’s society cultivates an environment where
people’s appearances determine our level of trust in them. People establish a particular level of
trust at the initial moment of communication with others and cognitively form varying
perceptions of that person. However, depending on perceptions formed, people may become
reluctant to form a relationship with one another based on appearance alone. Research is needed
to determine what aspect of ones appearance helps to determine trustworthiness.
The foundation of human interaction is based on trust, and more importantly, initial trust
is often times based on the appearance of an individual. Clothing and body image, in part help to
determine initial trustworthiness. Prior research has not keyed in on the perception of
trustworthiness and it’s affect due to a person’s appearance. Also, prior studies have focused on

more incidents and acts in the initial presence, yet exploration into the initial nonverbal message
between appearance and trustworthiness is lacking. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to
explore perceptions of one’s appearance and the level of trustworthiness it conveys.
Review of Literature
The key variables examined in this study are trust, appearance, and perception. These
variables may impact communication during initial interaction between two people. These
variables have been examined separately in previous studies. Heider’s (1994) attribution theory
is used to examine the dynamic between these three variables and provide a framework for the
study.
Trust
Trust is an important dimension on which almost every interaction can be characterized,
and according to Mast and Hall (2004) there is a wealth of research looking at what perceivers
use as indicators of trust in others. In the current study the main variable is trust. Trust is defined
as “expectancy held by an individual or a group that the word, promise, verbal or written
statement or perception of another individual or group can be relied upon” (Wheeless & Grotz,
1997, p. 651). Trust appears to be a fruitful variable for investigation in several fields on both
communication and psychology. Various studies examine different aspects of trust including
with relationships between friends and family members (Redl & Wineman, 1951), with authority
figures (Maher, 1956; Michel, 1961), and in the accuracy of judging others (Mast and Hall,
2004).
Trust is essential to both verbal and nonverbal communication research. Many studies
have been conducted on trust and its effect on communication. For example, people have a high
expectancy that others can be relied upon, and this is an important variable in the development of

<-----Page 4----->Appearance and Trustworthiness

5

adequate and healthy relationships (Wheeless & Grotz, 1997). Redl and Wineman (1951) found
that when there is a failure to trust others, particularly parents and teachers, usually lead to
delinquency. Further other studies (Wheeless & Grotz) have shown that when there is a lack of
trust then both race relationships and minority-majority group relationships suffer. Once there is
a lack of trust then there is anticipation that both the verbal and nonverbal actions of the other are
questionable.
Researchers in the field of nonverbal communication stress the significance of trust,
explaining it as “an important variable in human learning in general” (Wheeless & Grotz, 1997,
p. 651). A great deal of the formal and informal learning people experience is based on both the
verbal statements and nonverbal perceptions of others, and learning from others is “considerably
affected by the degree to which they believe their informants without independent evidence”
(Wheeless & Grotz, 1997, p. 651). In other words, the informants need to be trusted. Since trust
is affected by many perceptual factors, the current study is focusing on how initial appearance
might impact trustworthiness in others.
Appearance
Appearance cues according “serve as important environmental primes for initial
judgments of suitability” (Cherilnik, 1995, p. 288). Cherilnik (2004) looks at the role of
appearance in leader emergence and how aspects of appearance are predictive of social skills and
other traits. Cherilnik explains that, “People’s standing on personality traits that describe their
characteristic styles of interacting with others can be judged accurately from brief samples of
their behavior or even from their photographs” (p. 288). Results show that appearance plays an
important role in the judgments made in leadership emergence. Individuals determine ones

<-----Page 5----->Appearance and Trustworthiness

6

personality based on their outer appearance, thus allowing certain people to rise to leadership
positions.
Many researchers have focused their studies on appearance (Cherilnik, 2004; Dabbs, J.
M., 1997; Reid, 2004). Reid (2004) focuses on the impact of makeup and clothes on the overall
physical appearance, and importance of physical appearance with makeup and clothes on how
they affect political campaigns and the outcome of elections. He claims “appearance does matter
as a general indication of quality traits of a person” (Reid, 2004, p. 25). Appearances have
become important in many avenues for political campaigning as well as everyday life. Reid
states that we are a society that “judges from the outside in” (p. 24). While his study illustrates
the importance appearance has on the political makeup, the current study is focusing on the
impact of appearance on initial trust.
Perception
The question of how we form perceptions of other people has long been an important
issue in communication and social psychology (Patterson, Foster, & Bellmer, 2001). Patterson,
Foster, and Bellmer (2001) write “perceivers are generally seen as information processors who
assimilate input and logically applied rules of inference. In addition, perceivers are, presumably,
prone to a wide variety of errors and biases in their judgments” (p. 207). In contrast Swann
(1984) identified problems with attributional perspective on social perception but argued that
perceivers are much more accurate in their judgments. Consistent with Swann’s affirmation,
continuing research has showed that some perceptions of complete strangers can be accurately
made on the basis of limited information (Patterson, et, al., 2001). If perception of others is
indeed accurate, then there is a possibility that several personality attributes will be effected,
including trust.

According to Ambady, Hallahan, and Richeson (2000) who have extensively investigated
how people make relatively accurate perceptions by manipulating personal behavior, lasting
anywhere from a few seconds to five minutes in length. For example, in one recent study
participants judged the sexual orientation of subjects by viewing from one second and ten second
silent video segments (Patterson, Foster, & Bellmer, 2001, p. 207). Results showed significance,
showing accurate perceptions were made by viewing the two segments.
These studies have demonstrated how perceptual processes are a key ingredient in
nonverbal communication. Communication scholars focus on various ways of how perceptions
are accurate with social judgments, relationship partners, and behavioral and characteristic traits
to name a few (Patterson, Foster, & Bellmer, 2001). Although Swann (1984) demonstrates
problems with perception and judgments, stresses the importance of perception study and its
affect on communication.
Theortetical Framework: The Attribution Theory
Fritz Heider, a psychologist and former professor at the University of Kansas, believes
that the process of drawing inferences or perceptions is the act of attributing. This is the basis of
his Attribution Theory (Griffin, 1994). We are constantly told we should not judge others;
however, as a society we immediately stereotype others going beyond sensory information. The
Attribution Theory suggests that we cannot help forming perceptions. Attribution is a three step
process through which we perceive others as causal agents (Griffin, 1994). These steps include
(1) perception of interaction, (2) judgment of interaction, and (3) attribution of disposition. This
theory “has stimulated thousands of research studies that investigate the way people interpret the
behavior they see” (Griffin, 1994, p. 144).

In the current study Attribution Theory provides a theoretical framework and is testing
initial perceptions of appearance and its impact on trust. Previous researchers have used this
theory when examining whether or not initial perceptions of status determine the likelihood of
trust. Therefore, this study does not focus on status and interaction, but rather trustworthiness
based solely on appearance, without knowledge of the individuals status. Attribution theory
provides a proficient framework for the study.
Research Question:
The current study focuses on how trust is determined by the perceptions of ones
appearance.
The research question posed by the study was:
RQ: Does the dress of an individual have an effect on people’s perceptions of initial
trustworthiness?
Methodology:
Participants
Sixty college students from the University of Kentucky participated in this study. The
sample was comprised of 41 males and 19 females. The participants’ age ranged from 19 to 37
years. The frequency of ethnicity included 49 Caucasians, 6 African Americans, 3 Asians, and 3
of other descents.
Procedures
Trust was measured using the Individualized Trust Scale. The 15-item survey contained
questions exploring levels of trust using semantic differential posing questions. Another
questionnaire was designed to gather demographic data from the participants.

Instrumentation
The methodology used for the current study was an experiment. Experiments derived
from survey research are an accurate way in receiving data in such short periods of time as well
as the most appropriate choice due to the sample being taken. The stimulus materials taken were
directed at four FORTUNE magazine photographs of America’s top fortune 500 company
CEO’s. The participants were unaware of who the individuals were appearing in the photograph.
To control bias of data the photographs consisted of four males ranging in ages of middle 40’s to
middle 60’s. Each gentleman appeared of the same facial expression and all four were of
Caucasian descent. Fifteen participants were to view one picture allowing for 60 participants and
data collected. The data was then put into the SPSS software program that allows for easy
statistical analysis. After data input a simple correlation was conducted to test the research
question. This correlation conducted considers all variables of interest to be assessed and
analyzes how those variables relate to one another in a single relationship. The current study
consisted of three main variables; appearance, perception, and trust.
Results:
Reliability Statistics
Cronbach’s Alpha was calculated. Alpha for the 15-item Interpersonal trust scale was
α = .934 (no items were deleted from the individualized trust scale to receive this alpha).
Descriptive Statistics
The individualized trust scale scores ranged from 2.20 to 6.80 (M = 4.87, SD = 1.11).
Comparison of means
The research question proposed was: Does the dress of an individual have an effect on people’s
perceptions of initial trustworthiness. There was not a significant difference with the comparison

<-----Page 9----->Appearance and Trustworthiness

10

of means between the two groups; casual dress (n = 30, M = 5.01, SD = .893), formal dress (n =
30, M = 4.733, SD 1.29), t (58) = -.97, p = .34. Both groups were found to be moderately
untrustworthy.
Discussion:
Interpretation
The current study researched whether individuals are more likely to form a level of trust
determined merely on appearance and dress; the findings, however, were not significant with the
research question. The results indicate there is not a significant correlation between dress and
trustworthiness. The significant level was .023 therefore the research question was rejected. The
individualized trust scale had an alpha above .8 which demonstrates a high reliability between
the items in the trust scale. The research question posed for negative reliability to determine trust
can be pertained to dress and appearance.
The study dealt with dress and trust. Finding research between these two variables helps
for further research with nonverbal communication. Although the findings were not significant
with the current research question the results indicate that dress and appearance do not correlate
with the nonverbal message of trust. Appearance and dress are important with nonverbal
communication and forming perceptions. There is limited research on the correlation of these
two variables. This study has provided some explanation with trust and appearance and in aiding
for future research. This study although not significant with the current research question
provides for future knowledge with nonverbal communication field.
Limitations
The current study although proposed much strength toward nonverbal communication,
possessed many limitations.

Internal Validity. The questions addressed on the questionnaire were posed from the
interpersonal trust scale. A few questions were raised as to what some of the words meant when
being referred to trust issues. Therefore different interpretations of the definitions to these
general questions might have lead to skewed results. The questionnaires were given to
participants on a convenience bases. Participants were asked to fill out the questionnaires in a
short period of time, therefore might have been rushed and not accurately answered all questions.
Also when answering the questions participants were not isolated, consequently, the results
might have suffered form interpersonal bias (The Hawthorne Effect). These are a few limitations
due to interval validity that may have caused skewed results.
External validity. There were a few external limitations that may have affected the external
validity of the results. Participants were chosen from the University of Kentucky on a
convenience and voluntary bases. The sample population of 60 did not reflect the university and
city size to ensure that the sample was representative of the total population. Samples
representing the population allow for more accurate results. The sample being based on
convenience and volunteers could also indicate the sample was not reliable. The demographics of
the population could account for skewed results as well. Researchers should always consider an
equal amount of participants with gender and ethnicity. The current study however samplws
fewer females and over 80% percent were Caucasian.
Future Research
These findings add to the understanding of appearance and nonverbal messages and
suggest for future research in the communication field. First researchers should take a narrower
look as to what about appearance might determine one’s trustworthiness: body image, facial
expression, and clothing? Researchers should also further study how different appearance

<-----Page 11----->Appearance and Trustworthiness

12

characteristics determine levels of trust. These topics will help researchers and society
understand more about appearance and how it can affect nonverbal messages being sent and
obtained.
Secondly future research should focus on a more appropriate sample of participants. A
more random sample should be considered with more universities rather than just the University
of Kentucky. The sample population should consist of more ethnic background participants to
study how appearance and trust can differ depending on ethnicity. These two scenarios will
extend external validity so that the results can be comprehensive and useful to a larger
population. The present study lays ground for future studies, which could aim at improving
appearance and trust at the level of an individual.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study looked at appearance and dress and its effect on the perceptions
of trust. After conducting survey research using the Individualized Trust Scale and through data
analysis with SPSS program, results indicate an overall negative correlation with dress and
trustworthiness. The study found for some report with appearance and nonverbal messages. The
study also allows for future research with appearance and perceptions with the attribution theory.
Future research can be a prominent breakthrough with appearance and dress and the nonverbal
communication field.
