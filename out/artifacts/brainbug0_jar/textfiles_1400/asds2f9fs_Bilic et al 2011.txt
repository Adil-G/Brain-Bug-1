The main focus of this paper is the entrepreneurial orientation, i.e. the future
career plans of undergraduate and graduate students at the Faculty of Economics,
University of Split. The research is based on empirical data, collected by a student
survey. We explore students' entrepreneurial orientation, i.e. their intention to
establish their own businesses. The emphasis is placed on the impact of the
educational system, in terms of its role of providing knowledge and tools, required
for implementing an entrepreneurial idea in practice. Furthermore, we explore the
difference in entrepreneurial capabilities between students, enrolled into courses,
such as Entrepreneurship, Entrepreneurship Workshop, etc., versus those who
were not enrolled into such courses. Empirical data on students’ behaviors is also
collected, in terms of their willingness to use additional opportunities, such as
scholarships, grants and international work experience, which provides additional
evidence of students’ plans for entrepreneurship after finishing their studies.
Based on those findings, relevant recommendations are being issued. The main
research limitation is related to the fact that research is conducted at a single
institution of higher education in Croatia.

1. INTRODUCTION
Entrepreneurship can be read as a cultural and economic phenomenon
(Grozdanić et al., 2008). It is a process of fundamental transformation: from an
innovative idea to an enterprise, as well as from an enterprise to creation of
value (Kauffman, 2007). There has been increasing research interest in the
influence of entrepreneurship and education on the entrepreneurial behavior of
students, especially in Eastern European countries during and after the transition
period. Entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as an important generator of
growth, innovation and especially new job creations (Bakotić & Kružić, 2010).
They also highlight the growing attention paid in many countries to fostering
entrepreneurship through university education and training. Exponentially, the
growth of entrepreneurship, as a field of research is evident in terms of the
number of researchers, articles, conferences, journals and business education
programs (Kružić & Pavić, 2010). The main focus of this paper is the analysis
of activities and future plans of undergraduate and graduate students at the
Faculty of Economics Split. This study also seeks to understand the influence of
different entrepreneurial courses 1 on students’ current and future entrepreneurial
orientation.
2. LITERATURE AND RESEARCH REVIEW ON
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND EDUCATION
Entrepreneurship is a process of establishing a business organization,
which provides goods and services, creates jobs, and contributes to the national
income and the overall economic development (Sethi, 2008). Entrepreneurial
education is frequently considered an effective strategy towards more
innovation (Lin, 2004).
Entrepreneurship has been a part of the curricula in higher education
institutions in North America for more than 50 years. The first graduate course
in entrepreneurship was offered at Harvard University in 1948 by Professor
Miles Mace (Katz, 2003). Soon after, Harvard Business School Professor
Georges Doriot originated the concept of venture capital. Today,
entrepreneurship courses are offered at most universities across the United
States and worldwide. The demand has been driven by the students themselves,
who are eager to take courses, ranging from business planning and start-up, to
entrepreneurial finance and technology management. Universities in many
1

These courses include: Entrepreneurship Workshop, Entrepreneurship, Family Business,
Business Planning, Strategies for New Businesses, and Entrepreneurial Planning.

countries have followed the example of US institutions and have instituted a
wide range of entrepreneurship education efforts (Fayolle, 2000; Lin, 2004).
In Europe, entrepreneurship only substantially began to enter the
curriculum in the last 10 years, although a handful of institutions started earlier
(Twaalfhoven & Wilson, 2004). This is in line with other trends, most notably
with the growth of the venture capital industry, which finances innovative,
growth-oriented companies 2.
Entrepreneurship education can help promote entrepreneurial and
innovative culture in Europe by changing mindsets and providing the necessary
skills. With the security of Europe’s welfare system, people are less willing to
take risks. This attitude is reinforced at the university, which traditionally has
been focused on enabling students to find secure jobs. Meanwhile,
globalization, rapid development of technology and the lower cost of travel
have completely changed the nature of work. It is no longer enough to train
students for a career. Universities must prepare students to work in a dynamic,
rapidly changing entrepreneurial and global environment (Wilson, 2008).
According to Fayolle & Klandt (2006), in contemporary entrepreneurship
education, entrepreneurship can be viewed from three different angles, namely
as a matter of culture or state of mind, as a matter of behavior, or as a matter of
creating specific situations. Education focused on entrepreneurship as a matter
of culture/state of mind encompasses those aspects that focus on values, beliefs
and attitudes associated with entrepreneurship (i.e. entrepreneurial mindset,
spirit or identity). Entrepreneurship education focused on behavior deals mostly
with specific skills in relation to entrepreneurial behavior, like seizing
opportunities, making decisions and developing social skills. Finally,
entrepreneurship education focused on creating specific situations, concerns the
creation of new firms and entrepreneurial situations (e.g. new ventures,
corporate venturing). Whereas the focus of entrepreneurship education in the
past was on the last dimension (venture creation, e.g. writing business plans),
many current scholars argue that the real challenge for entrepreneurship
education lies within the development of the first two dimensions, i.e. learning
for entrepreneurship, rather than learning about entrepreneurship (e.g. Gibb,
2002; Honig, 2004).

2
In the United States, the venture capital industry was started more than 40 years ago and began
to take off in the 1980s. In Europe, a significant growth in venture capital began only about a
decade ago, in the mid-1990s.

Croatia, as a post-communist country, has had a free market economy for
about 20 years now. The Faculty of Economics at the University of Split has a
short history of formal education, with the major in entrepreneurship, which
started five years ago, when the Bologna process was implemented. The first
students who graduated the entrepreneurship course, finished their study in
2010.
A significant number of scientists analyze the relationship between
education and its results, in terms of changing students’ attitudes and
knowledge gained at the courses. Kružić et al. (2008) provide evidence that the
educational process enhances students’ knowledge in the main aspects of family
business, with the students' attitudes being closer to the ideal model, after they
finish the course. Among the first who identified entrepreneurship as a
phenomenon worthy of study was Schumpeter (1934). Kružić & Pavić (2010)
conducted their research on entrepreneurship courses with two main objectives:
1) drawing up an inventory of entrepreneurial characteristics of Croatian
business students, in order to define their entrepreneurial profile; 2) evaluating
to what extent entrepreneurship education develops the entrepreneurial
capacities and mindset. This study revealed that the university-based
entrepreneurship education develops entrepreneurial capacity and mindset.
Furthermore, it showed that determination and communication skills are among
less developed characteristics of future entrepreneurs.
In their research into students’ perceptions of and intentions towards
entrepreneurship, Bakotić & Kružić (2010) concluded that more than 67% of
Croatian students have strong entrepreneurial intentions. Hell et al. (2009)
conducted a survey on entrepreneurial aspirations and sources of motivation for
entrepreneurship on a sample of the first and final year of graduate students at
the Faculty of Economics, University of Split. A small number of observed
students who already had previous entrepreneurial experience, showed a
positive (2.68%), or a very positive (1.88%) attitude toward entrepreneurship.
The results also revealed that 29.8% of the observed population had
entrepreneurial intentions.
Fostering entrepreneurship through education and training has also
received increasing attention from universities in many countries (Bakotić &
Kružić, 2010). Furthermore, it has been found that the entrepreneurs often have
a formal university education which makes them ready for the tough market
game (Robinson & Sexton, 1994).

3. METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND: RESEARCH DESIGN
AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
In spite of many studies, conducted on students’ population at the Faculty
of Economics, University of Split, our research went a step further, with the aim
of revealing current entrepreneurial characteristics of the observed students. The
sample included 253 students, out of which 70 were male and 183 were female.
The survey consisted of 18 questions, from the demographic characteristics
(such as gender and year of study), to the items more closely related to
entrepreneurship (business ideas, plans to start a private business, etc).
Students of three different study programs were included, namely the
undergraduate professional program of Business School students (B),
undergraduate (U) and graduate students (G) in Business Studies. The majority
of students (146) in the sample attend the undergraduate professional program
of the Business School. There were also 66 undergraduate and 41 graduate
students. The undergraduate professional program of the Business School is a
three-year study program that puts an emphasis on business practice, making it
slightly different from the other two observed programs. The Undergraduate
degree program in Business Studies is also a three-year program, which should
develop basic economics skills. Upon the completion of this program, the
students are awarded the academic title of Bachelor of Economics (BSc) and
can enroll into a graduate degree program. There are five fields of specialization
at the graduate program: Financial Management, Management, Marketing, IT
Management, and Accounting & Auditing. Upon graduation from any of the
two-year graduate programs, a student is awarded the academic title of Master
of Economics (MSc).
Entrepreneurship courses analyzed in this study are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Entrepreneurship Workshop,
Entrepreneurship,
Family Business,
Business Planning,
Strategies for New Businesses,
Entrepreneurial Planning.

According to study programs, some courses, such as Entrepreneurship
Workshop, Entrepreneurship, and Business Planning, are obligatory for
Business School students. Family Business is an optional course, so a student
119

<-----Page 5----->Management, Vol. 16, 2011, 1, pp. 115-128
I. Bilić, A. Prka, G. Vidović: How does education influence entrepreneurship orientation? Case…

choosing it can be assumed as demonstrating a somewhat more significant
interest in entrepreneurship.
Undergraduate study programs do not include obligatory entrepreneurship
courses. However, undergraduate students can choose between
Entrepreneurship, Family Business, Business Planning and Entrepreneurial
Planning as optional courses. Therefore, it can be supposed that undergraduate
and graduate students with the highest grade in those courses show a stronger
interest in entrepreneurship. Strategies for New Businesses is an obligatory
course for specialization in Entrepreneurship in the undergraduate program.
According to the number of entrepreneurship-related courses, a special indicator
for each group of students is created.
The curricula of the above-mentioned courses are designed to enhance
entrepreneurial skills and students’ entrepreneurial orientation. The topics
covered usually include generating a new business idea, creation of a business
idea, market and financial analysis of the business idea, phases of its
implementation, measuring success, sensitivity analysis, etc. In order to conduct
the analysis of the obtained data, the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS) 13.0 was used.
3.1. Research results
As a starting point, we first made some observations about students’
behavior during the educational process. We used six questionnaire items to
analyze our sample, as these six items reflected how active students were during
their education. The activities we referred to are: (a) membership in student
organizations, (b) applying for scholarship, (c) getting scholarships, (d)
applying for the position of a teaching assistant at undergraduate classes, (e)
working as a teaching assistant at undergraduate classes and (e) participating at
student competitions.
We also created a composite variable, which can reflect the students' level
of entrepreneurial orientation, called Students’ Entrepreneurial Orientation in
Business (SEOB). The SEOB variable is composed of six items, reflecting
students’ attitudes towards future plans for employment, or starting a business
(i.e. becoming an entrepreneur). These items are:
•
•
•
120

plans after study (employment or entrepreneurship),
participating at Career Days (i.e. job fairs),
work preferences (public sector or private sector),

thinking about one’s own business idea, if unable to find a job,
having a business idea,
already working on a business idea during the studies.

3.2. Research findings
The results of descriptive statistics are summarized in Table 1, which
demonstrates the distribution of students according to their activities (measured
by the six previously mentioned items) and the SEOB index.

As Table 1 shows, 51% of students are marked as highly passive during
their studies, while only one student has the value of 6 and is marked as a highly
active one. A total of 90.9% of the students in the sample are classified as being
“passive” as their activities valued at 2 or less. Furthermore, only a small
number of students have actually used the full potential of the educational
process and showed a minimum of activities during their studies. Less than 1%
percent of students have taken full advantage of educational possibilities
available to them. Our main conclusion is that most of students included into
the sample are passive, rather than active. It is supposed that such student
behavior can influence their attitudes toward the future entrepreneurial
orientation.

I. Bilić, A. Prka, G. Vidović: How does education influence entrepreneurship orientation? Case…

There is a significantly different distribution of the SEOB index in
comparison to the distribution of student activities that is also shown in Table 1.
For example, there are 24.5% of students with an index value of 2, which is
low, but not extremely low; there are nine students that are entrepreneurial
“experts” (index valued at 6) outside their regular study obligations. In
comparison with student activities, our students show a greater entrepreneurship
orientation in business than in their activities in the education system in general.
In order to get a clear overview of the student sample based on the
difference between courses, we observed some general characteristics of our
students such as: gender, study program, year of study, and their plans for
continuing their studies.
Table 2 demonstrates a comparison between the SEOB index and the
average number of courses in which students enrolled according to gender,
study program, year of study, and their plans for continuing their studies.
Research results show that male students (with the average SEOB value of 2.27)
have a higher entrepreneurial orientation than the female students, who have the
average SEOB value of 1.83.
Furthermore, graduate students have a higher level of entrepreneurial
orientation (with the average SEOB value of 2.098) than the students of the
undergraduate professional program (with the average SEOB value of 1.93) and
undergraduate students (with the average SEOB value of 1.89). According to the
year of study, students in the 2nd year of study, as well as those who plan to
continue their studies have a higher SEOB index than other students in the
sample.

According to the independent samples t-test between the SEOB and gender,
there is a statistically significant difference in the SEOB between male and
female students (Table 3). The empirical significance at the 5% level confirms
the hypothesis.

In this study, we tried to identify the existence of a statistically significant
difference in the SEOB for students taking different courses. The independent
samples t-test has shown there is no statistically significant difference between
the SEOB for each of the courses.
The independent samples t-test between the SEOB and Entrepreneurship
Workshop reveals that there is no statistically significant difference between
students that enrolled in that course (144 of them) in comparison with other
courses (the average SEOB was 1.92). The independent samples t-test between
the SEOB and Entrepreneurship shows that there is no statistically significant
difference between students who enrolled in this course, in comparison with
other courses. Results for other analyzed courses are presented in Table 4.
Our results reveal that there are no statistically significant differences
between students enrolled in the analyzed courses, regarding the result of their
SEOB index. Furthermore, the SEOB index has the highest value for the group
of students enrolled into the course Strategies for New Businesses course, which
is obligatory for the Entrepreneurship specialization of the undergraduate
program. In addition, students enrolled into the Family Business course, which
is an elective for the Business School and undergraduate programs, have a

Table 5 presents the Pearson coefficients of linear correlation,
demonstrating the relationship between the number of students enrolled into

-0.2 and 0.065, which can be interpreted in terms of a relatively weak
relationship.

4. CONCLUSION
The survey results provide an interesting picture of the students from the
Faculty of Economics, University of Split, as they reflect the lack of their
entrepreneurial orientation. The mean values of the SEOB composite value of
1.83 and 2.27, on a scale from 0 to 6, prove such a statement.
Several significant differences in the index among different groups of
students were identified. Male students have a statistically significant higher
average value of the SEOB index, while graduate students are more
entrepreneurially oriented with the SEOB index of 2.098, the students of the
professional studies program and the undergraduate students, who have the
SEOB index of 1.93 and 1.89, respectively. There is also a low correlation,
which is statistically significant, between enrollment into entrepreneurship
courses and the SEOB index (with the coefficient values between -0.2 and
0.065.
It is interesting that both variable sets (related to student characteristics and
the entrepreneurial orientation, measured by the SEOB value) have the highest
value for graduate students and lowest for undergraduate students. Since
graduate studies represent the continuity of the undergraduate study programs,
we can conclude that students become more entrepreneurially oriented at the
final stage of their education, but still insufficiently.

I. Bilić, A. Prka, G. Vidović: How does education influence entrepreneurship orientation? Case…

Although the Faculty of Economics, University of Split has a short history
of offering entrepreneurial courses, results of this study, especially as regards
low correlation between student enrollment in entrepreneurial courses and their
entrepreneurial orientation can be an important stimulus for improving and
rethinking the entrepreneurial curricula. In addition, one of the main reasons for
a low correlation between enrollment in entrepreneurship courses and student
entrepreneurial orientation could be the fact that students are less willing to take
risks and feel insecure about risk-taking, which could be interpreted in terms of
cultural heritage of the post-communist system. Furthermore, global recession
and a generally complex state policy with lots of bureaucracy and a short supply
of credit could also be the factors of demotivation for students' future plans to
become entrepreneurs.
5. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
DIRECTIONS
The main research limitations of this research are the facts that the research
was conducted only on one institution and that there are no possibilities of
comparing our results with previous studies. It would be interesting to analyze
the SEOB index on the same group of students after a few years of work
experience. The current recession may also be a strong negative factor for
entrepreneurial orientation; the same research may produce opposite results
after the recession.

KAKO OBRAZOVANJE UJEČE NA PODUZETNIČKU ORIJENTACIJU?
STUDIJA SLUČAJA U HRVATSKOJ
Sažetak
Ovaj se rad usmjerava na poduzetničku orijentaciju, odnosno planove za karijeru
studenata preddiplomskog i diplomskog studija na Ekonomskom fakultetu Sveučilišta u
Splitu. Istraživanje je zasnovano na empirijskim podacima, prikupljenim na temelju
anketiranja studenata. U radu se istražuje poduzetnička orijentacija studenata, tj. njihova
namjera osnivanja vlastitog poduzeća. Naglasak se stavlja na utjecaj obrazovanog
sustava, i to na njegovu ulogu u osiguranju znanja i alata, potrebnih za praktičnu
provedbu poduzetničke ideje. Nadalje, analizira se razlika između poduzetničkih
sposobnosti između grupa studenata koji (ni)su slušali kolegije, poput "Poduzetništva",
"Poduzetničke radionice", itd. Prikupljeni su i podaci o ponašanju studenata, povezani s
njihovom željom za korištenjem dodatnih mogućnosti, kao što su stipendije, donacije i
međunarodne poslovne prakse, kako bi se dobile dodatne informacije o studentskim
planovima za uključivanje u poduzetništvo nakon završetka studija. Na temelju
dobivenih rezultata, formuliraju se i odgovarajuće preporuke. Temeljno ograničenje
ovog istraživanja je činjenica da je provedeno na samo jednoj instituciji visokog
obrazovanja u Hrvatskoj.
