Process tracing approaches such as verbal protocol analysis and information
board methodologies have been developed to study the cognitive processes
underlying decision making. This review summarizes the growing body of
literature using process tracing approaches to study decision making. Fortyfive studies were identified for this review and study characteristics were
coded. The results firmly demonstrate that noncompensatory strategies were
the dominant mode used by decision makers. Compensatory strategies were
typically used only when the number of alternatives and dimensions were
small or after a number of alternatives had been eliminated from consideration.
The research also indicates that information processing in decision making is
contingent on the demands of the task faced by the decision maker. Based on
this review, methodological issues that could contribute to improving the rigor
of process tracing research are discussed. The cost/benefit analysis framework
of L. R. Beach and T. R. Mitchell (1978, Academy of Management Review, 3,
439-449) is then used as an integrative framework and as a guide for identifying
needed directions for future research. 8 1989Academic PRSS. IK.

A large body of research has examined issues regarding the cognitive
processes underlying individual decision making. Two methodologically
distinct yet potentially complementary approaches developed to study
underlying cognitive processes are structural or statistical modeling and
process modeling (Abelson & Levi, 1985; Einhom, Kleinmuntz, & Klein-

muntz, 1979; Svenson, 1979). Structural models focus on describing the
relation between information stimuli (input) and decision responses (outcomes) (Abelson & Levi, 1985). By active manipulation of the information input factors, statistical models can be developed to predict individual decision choices and to draw inferences regarding underlying cognitive processes (Svenson, 1979).
Process models attempt to focus more directly on the intervening steps
that occur between the introduction of informational inputs and the decision outcomes. A fundamental principle of this research is that cognitive
processes should be studied by collecting data during the decision process

as often as possible (Svenson, 1979). With process models, the algorithms
or strategies that people use in arriving at a decision are the main focus of
inquiry.
Research utilizing structural models has demonstrated the robustness
of the linear model for predicting choices made by decision makers
(Slavic & Lichtenstein, 1971). Attempts to document the nonlinear use of
information have found that the addition of conflgural terms to structural
models has added little or no increment of predictable variance beyond
the simple linear model (e.g., Billings & Marcus, 1983; Goldberg, 1968).
The linear model implies that the decision maker uses a complex averaging process in which a decision represents a tradeoff among conflicting
evaluations (Pitz 8z Sachs, 1984). For example, Einhom et al. (1979)
contend that linear regression models may do more than merely predict
judgments as they may capture a fundamental characteristic of the decision making process.
From another perspective, the goodness of fit of the linear model is
posited to be more a function of the characteristics of the tasks used and
the insensitivity of the linear model than a characteristic of human decision behavior (Dawes & Corrigan, 1974; Slavic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1977). In addition, the predictive power of the linear model can
occur despite a seriously flawed model as two or more decision models
may be algebraically equivalent yet be suggestive of radically different
underlying cognitive processes (Anderson, 1969; Hoffman, 1960). Consequently, some researchers have concluded that cognitive processes cannot be understood by simply studying input-output relationships and that
the linear model is rarely sufficient when one is interested in the processes
being modeled (Pitz & Sachs, 1984; Svenson, 1979). From this perspective, the predictive benefits of linear models must not be accepted at the
expense of denying the existence and substantive meaning of nonlinear
judgmental processes (Pitz & Sachs, 1984; Slavic et al., 1977).
Payne (1976) noted that the limitations of the structural modeling approach for providing insights into cognitive processes require the development of new models and different methods of experimentation. He
adapted process tracing procedures used to research issues in human
problem solving (Newell & Simon, 1972)in an effort to derive explanatory
models of human decision behavior. Unlike the structural modeling perspective which focuses on the outcomes of the decision process, process
tracing approaches observe the predecisional behavior in analyzing a situation by tracing the steps leading to a decision (Payne, Braunstein, &
Carroll, 1978). Process tracing directly assesses what information was
accessed to form a judgment and the order in which the information was
accessed. This information is used to make inferences about what decision strategies have been used in arriving at a choice.

<-----Page 2----->PROCESS TRACING

Two major process tracing methods are verbal protocols and information boards (eye movement methods have also been used but have been
applied to a restricted set of tasks and problem situations). Verbal protocol analysis requires the decision maker to think aloud while actually
making decisions. Decision makers are asked to describe what they are
thinking or doing as they go through their evaluation of information. The
verbal statements can then be coded and hypotheses tested regarding a
model or theory of the decision process. Information boards require participants to explicitly search for information about available alternatives
and usually require a choice among the available alternatives. Examination of the decision maker’s depth and pattern of information search can
be examined to identify alternative models or strategies used in making a
decision.
The two major types of strategies described in the decision making
literature are compensatory and noncompensatory models. Compensatory models represent cognitively complex and sophisticated strategies
for information integration (Einhom & Hogarth, 1981) which are indicated by the absence of the interactive use of cues (Billings & Marcus,
1983). Compensatory strategies refer to either the linear model or the
additive difference model. The linear model assumes that each dimension
for a decision alternative is given a value and the dimensions are combined additively to produce an overall value for each alternative. Comparisons among alternatives are then based on these overall values and
the alternative with the greatest value is selected. The additive difference
model implies that decision makers compare alternatives on each dimension computing the difference between alternatives on each dimension
and then summing differences across dimensions. The summation of differences results in a preference for one decision alternative (Olshavsky,
1979). With both linear and additive difference models, a high value on
one dimension “compensates” or counteracts a low value on another
dimension for the same decision alternative.
Noncompensatory models are indicated by the interactive use of informational cues in which a low score on one dimension cannot be compensated for by a high score on another dimension (Billings 8z Marcus, 1983).
Noncompensatory strategies involve the use of simplifying rules to reduce the complexity of the decision problem. The major noncompensatory models which have been identified by Payne (1976) and others include conjunctive, disjunctive, lexicographic, and elimination by aspects
strategies.
Conjunctive strategies refer to the process in which decision makers
establish a minimum criterion for each dimension and then reject alternatives which do not meet this minimum standard for each dimension
(Svenson, 1979). A disjunctive model is defined as the requirement that

<-----Page 3----->78

FORD ET AL.

the selected alternative exceed the criterion on at least one dimension and
that the remaining alternatives are equal to or less than the criterion on
different dimensions (Olshavsky, 1979). The lexicographic and elimination by aspects strategiesinvolve the rank ordering of dimensions in terms
of importance. With the lexicographic strategy, the most attractive alternative on the most important dimension is selected (Payne, 1976). With
elimination by aspects, the most important dimension is examined first
and all alternatives that do not meet the predetermined criterion are eliminated from consideration (Svenson, 1979; Tversky, 1972).
A number of researchers contend that decision making is a highly contingent form of information processing (Beach & Mitchell, 1978;Einhom
& Hogarth, 1981; Newell & Simon, 1972; Payne, 1976, 1982; Svenson,
1979). From this perspective, the use of compensatory or noncompensatory decision strategies is a complex function of task, decision environment, and person characteristics. Payne (1982)reviewed decision making
research which indicates that information processing in decision making
is highly contingent on the demands of the task (e.g., the complexity of
the task). The identification of critical environmental and person factors
and the examination of their effects on decision processes are less well
documented.
The objective of many process tracing studies is to examine the effects
of task, environment, and/or person factors on the use of compensatory
and noncompensatory strategies. It has now been 10 years since process
tracing was introduced to the decision making literature by Payne (1976).
Previous reviews of process modeling and process tracing techniques
(Abelson & Levi, 1985;Jacoby, Jaccard, Kuss, Troutman, & Mazursky,
in press) have focused on describing rather than critically evaluating the
utility of the research that has been conducted.
The purpose of the present review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research using process tracing approaches to study decision
behavior. Studies using process tracing were reviewed and study characteristics coded. The variables of interest in the process tracing studies are
described and the evidence for the impact of task, environmental, and
person factors on strategy use examined. The major conclusions that can
be drawn from this body of research are derived and methodological
issues which need to be addressed in the process tracing literature are
identified. The Beach and Mitchell (1978)model which examines decision
making from a cost/benefit perspective is then used as an organizing
framework for understanding the results found and for identifying needed
future directions for research using process tracing approaches.
METHOD
Sample

An attempt was made to locate and summarize results of published and

<-----Page 4----->PROCESS TRACING

79

unpublished studies that used process tracing approaches to study decision behaviors. Sources for gathering relevant studies included references
cited by Payne (1976, 1982), a manual search of the Social Science Citation Index, a computerized search of Psychological Abstracts using key
words such as process tracing, verbal protocol, and information board,
and solicitation of studies from researchers active in decision making
research. Two criteria were used for including a study in this review: (I)
at least one process tracing approach was utilized; and (2) one or more
search variables or decision strategies were examined. Forty-five studies
from 41 articles met the two criteria and were included in the review.
The forty-five studies were divided among five coders such that each
study was examined independently by two researchers. Each pair of coders met to discuss the coding of the studies. Any disagreements in the
coding resulted in both coders reviewing the study to reach agreement as
to the appropriate coding. After this process was complete, the five coders met to discuss the viability of the coding categories and the nature of
the inconsistencies in category coding. Discussion of coding issues resulted in a slight refinement of the coding scheme and the subsequent
reevaluation of each study in the review.
Coding Strategy

Nine study characteristics were coded by the researchers: (1) sample,
(2) task, (3) process tracing approach, (4) task stimuli, (5) cues, (6) independent variables, (7) search process, (8) decision strategy, and (9) study
findings. These characteristics were chosen to provide descriptive information regarding the domains to which process tracing research has been
applied as well as providing a summary of the results found in the process
tracing studies. A description of the coding for each of the nine characteristics is provided below.
Sample and task. The sample was coded by identifying the number and
type of subject used in each study (e.g., 99 students). Task characteristics
were coded to include both the object of the decision (e.g., apartment,
consumer product) and the type of decision made (judgment or choice).
Judgment tasks require subjects to make a rating or overall evaluation for
each available alternative. A choice task requires subjects to choose one
of the available alternatives.
Process tracing approach. Studies were coded as using verbal protocol
analysis (VPA), the information board (IB), or both process tracing approaches (VPA, IB). A verbal protocol study asks subjects to think aloud
while acquiring information about the decision task. An information
board study presents subjects a matrix of alternatives (e.g., apartments)
and dimensions (often scaled attributes, e.g., rent) representing a decision
situation and monitors the process of acquiring information.

<-----Page 5----->80

FORD ET AL.

Information boards are either mechanically operated or computerized.
For the mechanical board, cards with pieces of information are placed
face down in the cells of the matrix and subjects are asked to manually
turn over the pieces of information desired. The computerized approach
develops a program which can be used to display the matrix of information on a computer terminal or screen. For this review, both types of
information boards were coded as IB.
Tusk stimuli and cues. Klayman (1983)noted that search strategies may
vary as a function of the number of alternatives and dimensions and the
distribution of cue values for the attributes. For this review, task stimuli
were defined as the amount of information available to the subjects. Task
stimuli were coded as the number of alternatives available to the subject
by the number of dimensions that provided information about each alternative. For studies in which task stimuli were experimentally manipulated, the number of alternatives and dimensions which varied across
subjects was also recorded.
Cues are the values that define the task stimuli (each alternative/
dimension pair). Two types of information about cues were coded for
each study: (1) the number of cue levels, and (2) the content of the cues.
The number of cue levels provides information as to the range and variability in the values possible across alternatives. Cue levels were categorized as “dichotomous,” “continuous,” or “mixed.” When the values of
all the task stimuli had only two possible values, the cues were coded as
dichotomous (e.g., a value of “yes” or “no” for the dimension labeled
“dishwasher included”). Continuous cues were defined as involving a
range of three or more values (e.g., rent for $150, $200, or $250)for all the
task stimuli in the study. Studies in which some of the task stimuli were
defined by two values while others were defined by three or more values
were labeled as “mixed.”
Huber (1980)showed that cue content can affect strategy use. He found
that when cues were described in words instead of numbers, decision
makers used simplifying rather than more complex compensatory strategies. Therefore, for this review, the content of cues was categorized as
“descriptive,” “quantitative,” or “mixed.” Descriptive content refers to
cues in which words or short phrases were used as cue values (e.g., small,
medium, large). Cues were labeled as quantitative when numerical values
were used to represent cue values (e.g., 2,3, or 4 rooms in an apartment).
Studies which had both descriptive and quantitative cue values were
coded as “mixed.” Studies in which no information about cue level or
content were labeled as “not presented.” (NP).
Independent variables. The purpose of many process tracing studies is
to examine the effects of various person, task, and/or environmental factors on the search process and/or the selection of decision strategies. For

<-----Page 6----->PROCESS TRACING

81

this review, the independent variables for each study were coded. Manipulated and nonmanipulated variables were coded separately.
Search process. The salient characteristics of search process are (I)
depth of search, (2) sequence of search, (3) content of search, and (4)
latency of search (see Jacoby, Chestnut, Weigle, dz Fisher, 1976). For
each study, the characteristic(s) of the search process actually measured
was recorded.
Depth of search refers to the total amount of information searched (i.e.,
the number of alternative/dimension pairs acquired by the subject). Sequence of search refers to the temporal pattern in which information is
acquired and assessed through a comparison of the nth and the nth + 1
pieces of information searched (Payne, 1976). Depth of search and search
sequence are often examined to determine the search strategies used by
decision makers (Klayman, 1983; Payne, 1976; Svenson, 1979). For example, searching a large proportion of the available information is seen as
indicative of a compensatory strategy while low proportion search indicates the use of a noncompensatory strategy. Additionally, searching the
same proportion of information for each alternative (low variability of
search) indicates the use of a compensatory strategy while a variable
search pattern suggests a noncompensatory strategy. Finally, an interdimensional pattern suggests the use of a linear or conjunctive strategy
while an intradimensional search suggests an additive difference or elimination by aspects approach.
Content of search represents an analysis of the specific content of the
information acquired. For example, a researcher may be interested in the
reliance on price or nutrient information for a particular product. Latency
of search (response latency) is defined as the amount of time spent examining a particular piece of information and/or to make a final decision.
Finally, studies could attempt to categorize verbal protocol statements
made by the decision maker to examine search sequence. Studies which
conducted such protocol analysis were labeled as “coded verbal
statements.”
Decision strategies. In the decision making literature, the two major
categories of decision strategies are compensatory (often labeled linear)
and noncompensatory (nonlinear). Specific strategies identified for coding included linear (LN) and additive difference (AD) models which represent compensatory strategies and conjunctive, lexicographic, and elimination by aspects (EBA) models which represent noncompensatory strategy use.
Decision strategies could be coded in terms of whether the researcher
attempted to measure or study a particular strategy or in terms of whether
the researcher found evidence that a particular strategy was actually used
by a decision maker. Since for this review we were most interested in

<-----Page 7----->82

ET AL.

examining the factors affecting the decision process, decision strategies
were coded as present only if results indicated that a particular strategy
was used by at least one decision maker in the study. Studies failing to
examine decision strategies were coded as “not applicable” (NA).
Findings. For each study, a short summary of the results was recorded.
The results concentrate on describing the effects of the independent variables (task, environment, person factors) on search processes (e.g.,
depth, sequence, and content of search) and on the use of compensatory
and noncompensatory decision strategies.
RESULTS
The results of the review are separated into two sections. First, a descriptive summary of the study characteristics used in process tracing
research is presented. Second, evidence regarding the task, environmental and person determinants of search process, and strategy use is provided.
Coding of Study Characteristics
The coding of the 45 studies using process tracing approaches is presented in Table 1. A descriptive summary of the results for sample, task,
process tracing approach, task stimuli, cues, independent variables,
search process, and strategy is provided below.
Sample and task. Twenty-seven of the 45 studies used college students
as subjects and one study used elementary school aged children. Seven
studies used professionals in work organizations while three studies used
both students and professionals in the same study. Six studies used
“housewives” or “women” as subjects and one study did not present
information regarding the study participants. Sample size varied widely
across studies (from a sample of 1 to a sample of 196). The average sample
size across the 45 studies was 47.3 (SD = 45.5) with a median sample size
of 22.
The tasks about which decisions were required varied, though 10 studies involved the examination of housing options. Another 16 studies asked
participants to examine various consumer products such as toasters,
irons, cars, and stereos. Twelve studies required some type of evaluation
of another person such as deciding on loan candidates, treatment plans for
patients, and a choice of political candidates. Six studies used gambling
decision tasks.
Thirty-five studies required decision makers to make a choice of one of
the available alternatives. Seven studies required ratings of all the available alternatives. Three studies required that both choice and rating tasks
be performed.
Process tracing approach. Twenty-six studies used an information

<-----Page 8----->PROCESS

TRACING

83

board approach while 13 used verbal protocol analysis. Six (4 of which are
by Payne and his colleagues) studies used both verbal protocol analysis
and the information board to examine the decision making process.
Task stimuli and cues. Twenty-six of the 45 studies did not manipulate
task stimuli. For these 26 studies, the amount of information available for
access by the decision maker varied widely although most studies had less
than 15 alternatives and less than 15 dimensions. In 8 studies, the number
of alternatives was manipulated while in 1 study the number of dimensions was varied. In 11 studies, both the number of alternatives and the
number of dimensions were varied.
Fourteen studies did not present information about the cue levels provided decision makers. Of the 32 studies reporting information about cue
levels, 22 used continuous cue levels, 4 studies used dichotomous cues,
and 6 studies mixed dichotomous and continuous cue values. Fourteen
studies did not report information about cue content. Of the 32 studies
that did report cue content, 10 presented subjects with quantitative cues,
5 presented descriptive cues, and 17 presented a mixture of quantitative
and descriptive cues. Twelve studies did not report any information about
either cue level or cue content. Additionally, process tracing studies
failed to present evidence regarding the intercorrelation of the cues presented to decision makers.
Independent variables. In 40 of the 45 studies in this sample, researchers were interested in the effects of the characteristics of the decision
task, the decision environment, and/or the decision maker on the decision
making process. The other 5 studies were descriptive studies interested in
measuring decision processes rather than examining correlates of those
processes. Seventeen studies examined the effects of only one variable
while 23 studies examined the effects of multiple variables. Of the 40
studies, 33 examined effects of at least one task factor, 14 studies examined at least one person factor, and 5 studies examined at least one environmental factor.
The majority of the 33 studies (N = 20) examining task factors focused
on the effects of task complexity (defined as varying the number of alternatives [N = 8]), the number of dimensions (N = l), or both the number
of alternatives and dimensions (N = 11). Four studies varied the format
used to display information about dimensions and alternatives while 2
studies (Billings & Scherer, 1988; Williams, DeNisi, Blencoe, & Cafferty,
1985) varied the response mode required (choice or rating) of the subject. Ten studies varied the values of the cues in the matrix to examine
their effects on strategy use while 4 examined the effects of labeling on
search behavior. As an example of the use of labeling, Herstein (1981)
provided the political stand of the candidate prior to the search for information. Seven studies examined changes in strategy as a function of the

Compared results to Study 1 and found that display format
affected response latency, but did not affect search
sequence or depth of search.
Prior knowledge affected depth of search with moderate
knowledge subjects processing more than others; low
knowledge led to simpler decision strategies; strategies
found to change over course of the study with EBA used
early and linear strategies used later.
Task complexity was related to depth of search, variability
of search, and the use of noncompensatory strategies.
The percentage of information searched was greater in
tasks with similar alternatives while variability of search
decreased.
Shifting from inter- to intradimensional search pattern did
not help subjects deal with increased number of
alternatives while moving from linear to nonlinear
strategies did. Process tracing and regression measures do
not converge.
Response mode affected depth of search as those in rating
condition searched more information. Depth of search
decreased over trials. Decision, importance had no main
effect on depth of search but individuals in high
importance task searched for more information in choice
mode. Search sequence was affected by response mode
and decision importance as intradimensional search was
more likely under choice and under tasks of low
importance.

Display format affected response latency, search sequence,
and depth of search.

Findings
Female experienced PhDs working in an agency setting
were judged to have more appropriate treatment plans;
individual differences in search sequence and response
latency found which were related to the efficiency of
treatment plans. Those who used more “typical”
information produced better plans.
Total amount of information searched related to number of
dimensions. Individual differences in use of linear or
nonlinear strategies. High SES sought more information
than low SES. Perceived risk and memory aids affected
depth but not search sequence or content.
Individual differences in strategies used from high (search
sequence by dimension; large number of alternatives
examined) to low (search by alternative; few alternatives
examined) complex processors. Evidence that
performance on cognitive tasks was somewhat related to
complexity of the search process.
Decision makers used multistage models involving
conjunctive processes. Buyers first eliminated vendors on
basis of price differences and delivery time and then
looked at delivery history. Number of alternatives had no
effect on strategy used.
More dimensions of the chosen alternative were examined;
differences in attractiveness ratings for chosen vs
nonchosen alternatives increased over time; additive rules
were better than other rules for predicting fmal choice.
Found evidence for linear and nonlinear strategies being
used in rating task. The regression model was superior to
process tracing in prediction.

Found evidence for linear and nonlinear strategy used in a
rating task; regression and process tracing had similar
predictive ability and should complement each other.
Depth of search was dependent on political stand of
candidate. Display format affected the frequency which
subjects made overaIl evaluations and search sequence;
number of verbal statements did not differ across
conditions but number of evaluative statements were
related to type of display; display and verbal statement
also related to search sequence.
Processing by alternative or by dimension was equally
likely. Past experience and attitudes related to
contraceptives and sex did not account for any
meaningful variance in search behavior,
Mood state affected response latency and content of search
but not depth of search. Positive mood states resulted in
increased use of EBA strategies and the elimination of
less important dimensions from search. No subject used a
linear strategy.
Perceived risk and brand loyalty were not related to search
behavior. Product importance was related to depth of
search. Past purchasing experience led to increased depth
of search.
Performance level of analysts was related to the amount and
content of information searched. Depth of search
decreased over trials as high performers examined the
same amount of information across task trials while low
performers looked at fewer pieces of information over
trials. High performers were more likely to engage in
systematic processing of information.

Less information was selected when brand and
manufacturer name were available. Brand name and price
were the most frequently searched dimensions. The
number of brands did not affect content of search. Brand/
manufacturer availability did not affect response latency.
Expertise of rater affected depth of search, time spent
examining applicant files, and the type of information
examined. Experts searched more actively while novices
examined data in the order presented. The information
processing of experts did not resemble linear regression
models as they paid attention to extreme cue values
which applied only to a particular case.
Number of alternatives affected the number of evaluative
and elimination statements made. An increase in the
number of alternatives resulted in the use of
noncompensatory strategies and a concentration on fewer
dimensions. Attribute based processing was more likely
with an increase in the number of alternatives. Use of
compensatory strategies was rare.
Number of alternatives affected strategy use as subjects
shifted to noncompensatory strategies with increased
number of alternatives. Cue values did not affect
brand/attribute processing but there was a slight increase
in search for negatively correlated items as the number of
alternatives increased.
Processing diiculty (decimal or fraction cue values)
affected search sequence and response latency. Response
mode affected response latency (time spent looking at
probabilities).

Task complexity affected depth of search and resulted in
increased use of noncompensatory strategies. Mental
capacity was related to search sequence as high capacity
children searched more extensively with low task
complexity. With increased task complexity, high
capacity subjects increased depth of search on important
decisions especially females. No effect for display format
found.
Depth of search decreased over trials. Price change and
addition of a new alternative increased attention to
changed items but did not affect depth of search. Subjects
were more likely to search a piece of information
accessed in a previous trial. Subjects discontinued search
for certain dimensions but did not eliminate brands.
Subjects examined fewer dimensions for each alternative
over the course of the study.
Consistency information was acquired more often than
distinctiveness and consensus information. Sex of target
person had no effect on the amount of information or
type of information searched. Type of behavior affected
depth of search for distinctiveness information as more
information was acquired when the behavior was an
action than when the behavior was an emotion.
Evidence for simple nonlinear strategy followed by more
complex linear strategy; complexity of task increased
response latency and depth of search. Verbal protocols
indicated that task complexity affected strategy. Effect of
task familiarity on strategy was not reported.
Task complexity related to decision strategy with high
complex tasks resulting in simplifying strategiesrejecting alternatives on the basis of small amount of
information; task complexity affected decision time
although relation was not consistent across persons.

Time pressure affected depth of search and response
latency as subjects processed information more quickly
under pressure. Pressure was not related to a shift in
search sequence. Cue values affected depth, sequence,
and latency of search.

Decision processes are task dependent and individual
differences determine reliance on interdimensional or
intradimensional search sequence. Cue values produced
individual differences in search sequence. Various linear
and nonlinear strategies were used.
Depth of search declined as task complexity increased;
subjects efiminated alternatives on basis of a small
amount of information when there were many
alternatives; nonlinear strategies used early and linear
strategies later in the study.
Number of alternatives had an effect on depth of search but
number of dimensions did not; as the number of
alternatives increased, subjects shifted from linear to
nonlinear search strategies.
Time pressure affected depth of search and search was
focused on the most important (probabilities, not payoffs)
information. Processing of information was faster with
high time pressure and processing became more attribute
based. With high pressure there was more variance in
search. Cue values affected extent of attribute processing,
search sequence, and response latency.

Task complexity affected variability of search as variability
increased as the number of alternatives increased.
Processing by alternatives was likely when there were
few alternatives. No evidence was found for a change in
strategy from nonlinear to linear as the task progressed.
Task complexity was related to depth of search. Judgment
accuracy was a function of the amount of information
available to subjects. Perceived importance of dimensions
was related to depth and sequence of search.
Task complexity increased the amount of information
sought but decreased amount of information per
dimension; task complexity was also related to the use of
nonlinear strategy.

Value of cues affected use of decision rules such as CJ,

subjects used a variety of strategies during the task
although most were satisficing (nonlinear) rules.
IndividuaIs differed in the strategies used to make probation
decisions. Confidence in decision was related to
perceived ease of the task.
Depth of search was not affected by appraisal purpose or
the decision task (choice or rating). Subjects searched
more for distinctiveness information than for consensus
or consistency information. Content of search did not
differ by appraisal purpose or decision task.

Note. In the table above, the following abbreviations are used: IB = information board; VPA = verbal protocol analysis; NP = not presented;
AD = additive difference; CJ = conjunctive/disjunctive; EBA = elimination by aspects; LN = linear; LX = lexicographic; and NA = not
applicable. “Stimuli” were coded as the number of alternatives by the number of dimensions. “Cues” in the informational matrix were coded into
two categories: (a) the number of cue levels (continuous, dichotomous, or mixed); and (b) the content of the cues (descriptive, quantitative, or
mixed). Variables that were examined for their effect on search variables or search strategy were labeled as “Independent Variables.” The
“Independent Variables” were coded into those variables that (a) were directly manipulated by the researcher, or (b) were nonmanipulated and
examined for their relation to search processes. The code “None” refers to studies in which no independent variable (manipulated or nonmanipulated) was examined.

number of task trials. Capon and Burke (1980) examined the effects of the
availability of memory aids designed to help research participants come to
a decision on buying a consumer product.
Isen and Means (1983) manipulated mood states and Johnson (1985)
manipulated the expertise of the rater in attempts to examine the impact
of person factors on strategy use. Seven studies focused on the effects of
the participant’s past experiences relevant to the task on decision behavior. For example, Bettman and Park (1980) measured the level of prior
knowledge regarding consumer products while Olshavsky (1979) asked
subjects to rate how familiar they were with the products they would be
examining. Three studies measured aspects of the participant’s ability
including performance on cognitive tasks (Capon & Davis, 1984), mental
capability (Klayman, 1985), and the level of performance of stock analysts in buying and trading stocks (Jacoby, Mazursky, Troutman, dc Kuss,
1984). Other subject characteristics examined included the sex, socioeconomic status, and the decision confidence of the decision maker.
Three studies examined environmental factors by manipulating the importance of the choice made. For example, Williams et al. (1985) varied
the purpose of ratings provided subordinates. Promotional ratings were
hypothesized to be of more importance than ratings of training needs.
Two studies by Payne, Bettman, and Johnson (1986) varied the time
pressure surrounding the decision task.
A few studies examined the impact of multiple factors on decision
behaviors. Four studies examined both a task and a person factor, 4
studies examined a task and an environmental factor, and no studies
examined person and environmental factors together. Ten studies examined multiple task factors within 1 study while 4 studies examined multiple person factors. Most surprisingly, only Klayman (1985) attempted to
measure and examine the interactive effects of person (mental ability,
sex), task (task complexity, display format), and environmental (importance of the task) factors on decision behavior.
Search process. Forty-three studies examined at least one search process variable and 38 of these studies examined multiple (usually two)
measures of the search process. A majority of the studies measured depth
of search (N = 33) and search sequence (N = 37) which allows for the
examination of inter- and intradimensional search patterns as well as
indexing the variability in the proportion of information searched across
alternatives. Sixteen studies examined response latency and 18 studies
focused on the content of search. In 7 studies, researchers attempted to
code verbal statements in relation to the search process. For 2 studies, the
search process was not the primary focus of the research. For example,
Einhom et al. (1979) compared the results of process tracing and regression models.

<-----Page 23----->98

Strategy use. Twenty-four of the 45 studies reviewed examined the
strategies used by decision makers. For the other 21 studies, search variables such as depth of search, search sequence, and/or response latency
were the criterion of interest and no attempt was made to place respondents into decision strategy categories. Twelve of the 24 studies which
examined strategy use categorized respondents into the broad categories
of compensatory (linear) and noncompensatory (nonlinear) strategies.
While some attempt was made to discuss and in some cases measure
specific strategies such as elimination by aspects, the results of these 12
studies were provided in terms of compensatory and/or noncompensatory
strategies.
Of the 12 studies which examined specific strategies, evidence for the
use of the following strategies were found: (1) linear (N = 1l), (2) additive
difference (N = 8), (3) conjunctive (N = ll), (4) lexicographic (N = 6),
and (5) elimination by aspects (N = 10). Recall that finding evidence for
the use of a particular strategy meant that at least one person in the study
was categorized as using that strategy.
A closer examination of the results indicate that most studies found
evidence for the use of both compensatory and noncompensatory strategies. Nevertheless, more subjects were found which used noncompensatory strategies. For example, Isen and Means (1983) found that none of
their 22 subjects used an optimizing linear strategy but instead used some
combination of elimination by aspects and elimination by dimension strategies. Sundstrom (1984) found that only 6 of the 96 subjects in the study
used linear or additive difference strategies while the other subjects used
conjunctive or elimination by aspects models. Other studies which reported the use of compensatory strategies found that subjects often began
the task using simplifying strategies and then moved to more complex
compensatory strategies as the number of alternatives and dimensions
were reduced (e.g., Bettman & Park, 1980; Crow, Olshavsky, & Summers, 1980; Olshavsky, 1979; Payne, 1976).
In this section, descriptive information relevant to study characteristics
and strategy use by decision makers was presented. The objective of the
next section is to examine the results of studies which assessedthe extent
to which various independent variables affected search behavior and
strategy use.
Search Process and Strategy Determinants
Researchers have identified various task, environmental, and person
factors that may inlluence the search process (depth and sequence of
search, response latency, content of search) and the strategy used (compensatory, noncompensatory) by decision makers. In this section, we

<-----Page 24----->PROCESS

examine the degree to which the studies reviewed indicate that decision
making is contingent on task, environmental, and person characteristics.
Tusk characteristics. The task factors examined in process tracing studies include task complexity, display format, response mode, cue values,
labeling of task stimuli, and task trials. The results indicate that increasing
task complexity (increasing the number of alternatives, dimensions, or
both alternatives and dimensions) increases the likelihood that subjects
use simplifying nonlinear strategies to make their decision task more manageable (Biggs, Bedard, Gaber, & Linsmeier, 1985; Billings & Marcus,
1983; Johnson & Meyer, 1984; Johnson, Meyer, & Ghore, 1986; Klayman, 1985; Olshavsky, 1979; Onken, Hastie, & Revelle, 1985; Payne,
1976; Payne & Braunstein, 1977, 1978; Staelin & Payne, 1976). The tinding for task complexity effects on simplifying strategies is robust across
information boards and verbal protocol methods. It should be noted,
though, that the results of one verbal protocol analysis study by Crow,
Olshavsky, and Summers (1980) showed no effect of task complexity on
strategy use.
Task complexity has also been found to atfect depth of search (Capon
& Davis, 1984; Klayman, 1985; Payne, 1976; Payne & Braunstein, 1977,
1978; Shields, 1980, 1983), variability of search (Biggs et al., 1985; Payne
& Braunstein, 1977, 1978; Shields, 1980), and response latency
(Olshavsky, 1979; Onken et al., 1985; Payne & Braunstein, 1977, 1978).
Results indicate that increases in task complexity lead to (1) decreases in
the proportion of information search, (2) increases in the variability of
search patterns, and (3) decreases in mean search time. As noted by
Billings and Marcus (1983), the increased variability of search as task
complexity increases suggests that some alternatives are eliminated early
in the process while others are searched more thoroughly. Billings and
Marcus (1983) also found that shifting from an inter- to an intradimensional search sequence did not help subjects deal with increased task
complexity while moving from a linear to a nonlinear strategy did.
Bettman and Kakkar (1977, Studies 1 and 2) found evidence that display format affected depth of search, search sequence, and response latency in that subjects could be induced to search by dimension or alternative if the information was organized in that fashion for them. Herstein
(1981) found that display format (presented to make dimensions or alternatives salient) infhtenced the number of evaluative statements made
about political candidates in verbal protocols. Klayman (1985) found no
effect for display format with elementary school children on strategy use
while Sundstrom (1984) found only marginally significant effects for display format on search sequence.
One aspect of the task that would seem particularly important is the
type of decision required of the participant. In regression studies, partic-

<-----Page 25----->100

FORD ET AL.

ipants are asked to rate all the alternatives and these ratings are regressed
on the information attribute values. In process tracing studies, the decision required of participants is often a choice from among a set of alternatives. Only Einhom et al. (1979) used a rating rather than a choice task
with verbal protocol analysis while Billings and Marcus (1983) and Billings and Scherer (1988) examined both ratings and choice data with an
information board approach. Williams et al. (1985) used an information
board approach and asked subjects for ratings of performance. Based on
the limited amount of research, it appears that response mode does affect
decision processes. For example, Billings and Scherer (in press) found
that response mode affected depth of search as those in the rating condition searched more information than those in the choice condition. In
addition, search sequence was affected by response mode as intradimensional search was more likely under the choice task.
The cue content and cue values available to subjects would seem to be
a likely determinant of information search pattern and some recent research efforts have been directed to investigate their effects. While no
studies were found which attempted to manipulate cue content in terms of
words versus numerical values, one study by Johnson, Payne, and Bettman (1986) provided subjects examining gambles with cue values in decimal or fraction format. The researchers hypothesized that fractions require more difficult information processing than decimal values. The results indicated that increased difficulty of information processing led to
increases in response latencies and a shift in search sequence. Major
(1980) found that behavioral cues given in the form of actions were
searched more often than behaviors provided in the form of emotions.
Variations in cue levels have also been found to affect search processes
and strategy use. There is evidence that varying cue values increases
individual differences in the use of nonlinear strategies (Payne, 1974;
Svenson, 1974). Payne, Bettman, and Johnson (1986) also found that
providing low or high variances in probabilities regarding gambles affected search processes. Subjects acquired less information, spent less
time overall and less time per information acquisition, and used more
attribute-based processing when the variance in probabilities was high
rather than low. Biggs et al. (1985) also found that the greater the dissimilarity of the cue values across alternatives, the less information was
searched while the variance in search patterns increased. Finally, Lehman and Moore (1980) introduced a change in the price of breads during
the course of their study and found that this change in cue value for one
dimension resulted in increased attention (search) to the changed items.
A few studies examined the effects of providing labels for subjects prior
to information search. For example, Herstein (1981) provided subjects
with the political stand of candidates prior to allowing subjects to acquire

<-----Page 26----->PROCESS TRACING

101

information about each candidate. The political labeling was found to
affect the depth of search for the candidates. Jacoby, Szybillo, and
Busato-Schach (1977) manipulated whether the brand and manufacturer’s
name of toothpaste were provided to subjects prior to search. They found
that labeling resulted in less information being searched but did not affect
response latency.
Finally, some studies examined changes in search variables and strategy use over task trials. Bettman and Park (1980) found that strategies
changed from noncompensatory to more compensatory strategies as the
task progressed and as alternatives were eliminated. Shields (1980) on the
other hand found no evidence for a change to a more compensatory
strategy as the task progressed. In terms of search variables, a robust
finding is that depth of search decreases over task trials (Billings &
Scherer, 1988; Jacoby et al., 1984; Lehman & Moore, 1980; Lehman,
Moore, & Elrod, 1982). These results suggest that in studies requiring
multiple decisions, the researcher must be concerned with the ordering of
the decision tasks. In addition, Jacoby et al. (1984) found an interaction
between task trials and the ability of the decision maker in that depth of
search decreased more for low performing than for high performing security analysts.
Environmental characteristics. A few studies have examined the effects of the environment surrounding the decision task on the decision
making process. Two studies by Payne et al. (1986) examined the impact
of time pressure while three studies have focused on the effects of varying
the importance of the decision made. Time constraints have been found to
affect the depth and the focus of search. Subjects under time constraint
examined fewer pieces of information and tended to focus on the most
important information. Processing of information was faster with high
time pressure and processing became more attribute based. In addition,
high time pressure resulted in more variance in search patterns.
Klayman (1985) selected three decision topics (buying a bicycle, choosing a summer camp, and selecting a lunch special) which varied in importance and examined their impact on decision processes. Klayman
(1985) found that among high ability children there was an interaction
between topic importance and the amount of information available. When
there were few alternatives, important and unimportant decisions were
both searched for in the same depth. However, under conditions of high
task complexity, more important decisions received more search by high
ability children. Billings & Scherer (in press) varied the importance of the
task through instructions given subjects prior to beginning the task. They
found that decision importance had no main effect on depth of search but
individuals in the high importance task condition searched for more information in the choice rather than rating response mode. Results also

<-----Page 27----->102

FORD ET AL.

indicated that intradimensional search patterns were more likely under
tasks of low importance. Williams et al. (1985) varied task importance by
asking subjects to provide promotional ratings (high importance) or need
for training ratings (low importance). They found that depth and content
of search was not affected by the purpose of the appraisal.
Person characteristics.
While task and environmental characteristics
have been found to have a strong infhrence on search process and strategy
use in process tracing studies, most researchers have also cited a large
range of individual differences in the decision making process. Few studies have made an attempt to assess individual difference factors and examine their effects on how people make decisions.
The most frequently investigated person characteristic has been prior
knowledge or experience with a task. Bettman and Park (1980) found that
individuals with moderate knowledge and experience with microwave
ovens searched more than individuals of low or high previous experience.
More knowledgeable consumers tended to process information by brand
(looking at all attributes of a particular brand before considering another)
and consumers new to microwave ovens began with dimension search
first, then switched to brand-based evaluations. Inexperienced consumers
began with an elimination by aspects strategy early in the task while the
additive difference model was more representative of later decisions. Jacoby, Chestnut, and Fisher (1978) found greater information search by
those who had a great deal of past purchasing experience with buying
cereals. They also found brand loyalty was negatively related to amount
of information acquired. Johnson (1985) found that the expertise of the
decision maker rating job candidates affected depth of search, time spent
examining applicant files, as well as the type of information examined.
Experts searched more actively while novices examined data in the order
presented to them. Experts also paid more attention to extreme cue values which applied only to a particular case. On the other hand, Hoyer and
Jacoby (1982) found that past experience and attitudes related to contraceptives and sex did not account for any meaningful variance in search
behavior.
Researchers have also examined the relation between decision processes and the ability and skill of the decision maker. Capon and Davis
(1984) attempted to assess the cognitive ability of decision makers and
correlate the ability measures with search process variables and strategy.
While they were able to categorize their subjects into three different
groups with respect to the way they processed information, there was no
relation between these groupings and the cognitive ability measures.
Klayman (1985) measured mental capacity in elementary aged school
children and found that ability was related to search variability as high
and low capacity children searched for similar amounts of information

<-----Page 28----->PROCESS TRACING

103

across dimensions for low complexity tasks but high capacity children
acquired more information than low capacity children on tasks of high
complexity. In terms of skills, Jacoby et al. (1984) found that the performance level of security analysts (how accurately they predicted stock
prices) was related to the amount and content of information searched.
High performers tended to examine the same amount of information
across task trials while low performers looked at fewer pieces of information over trials. High performers were also more likely to engage in
systematic processing of information.
Perceived risk associated with making the wrong decision has been
investigated by Capon and Burke (1980) and Jacoby et ai. (1978). Jacoby
et al. (1978) found that perceived risk did not affect decision behavior
while Capon and Burke (1980) found risk affected depth but not sequence
of search.
Other individual difference variables have been studied. Experienced
female Ph.D.‘s were judged to have presented better treatment plans for
mental health patients than their male inexperienced colleagues (Butcher
& Scofield, 1984). Capon and Burke (1980) found that high socioeconomic
subjects sought more information and used linear strategies more frequently than did lower socioeconomic consumers in deciding what products to buy.
DISCUSSION
This review of the empirical research using process tracing approaches
was completed to systematically examine what the literature has found
regarding the extent of use, and determinants of, nonlinear strategies by
decision makers and to assess the types of variables and research strategies used by process tracing researchers. The first part of the discussion
highlights what we view as the most important conclusions derived from
the review of the studies listed in Table 1. In the second section, methodological issues that need to be addressed in the literature are presented.
For the last section of the discussion, the Beach and Mitchell (1978)
model of decision making is used as a framework for organizing the research on process tracing and to suggest additional substantive questions
that ought to receive more research attention.
Substantive Conclusions
Based on this review, conclusions can be drawn regarding both the
direction that process tracing research has taken and the empirical evidence relevant to strategy use. Two major conclusions regarding the direction of process tracing research are the focus of the research on the
effects of task characteristics and the use of general decision strategies
(compensatory, noncompensatory) as the criterion variables of interest.

<-----Page 29----->104

FORD ET AL.

First, most of the research using process tracing approaches has focused attention on the effects of task rather than environmental and person characteristics on decision behavior. The focus in decision making
research on the importance of task characteristics is most likely based on
the pioneering work of Newell and Simon (1972). Newell and Simon
(1972), in developing a framework for understanding information processing in problem solving tasks, strongly emphasized the importance of task
effects on decision behavior. As stated by Newell and Simon, if behavior
is demanded by the task situation and the subject exhibits it, then the
behavior tells more about the task environment than about the decision
maker. If put into a different task situation, the person would act differently. They contend, therefore, that a theory of problem solving cannot
predict behavior unless it encompassesboth an analysis of the task and an
analysis of the limits of rational adaptation to task requirements.
The research using process tracing is part of the broader problem solving framework for understanding information processing developed by
Newell and Simon (1972) and others. Payne (1976)adapted methods used
by Newell and Simon to research issues in problem solving to more directly examine the cognitive processing of information in judgment tasks.
Given this origin, the focus of process tracing research on task characteristics and their effects on strategy use is not surprising. Unfortunately,
the large amount of research using process tracing to study task effects
has not led (with the possible exception of task complexity) to the cumulation of knowledge necessary to begin the development of a taxonomy of
task characteristics which have been found to have predictable effects on
strategy use.
A second general conclusion regarding the direction of process tracing
research is that the major criterion of interest has been the use of compensatory or noncompensatory strategies by decision makers. While this
is not surprising given the emphasisof structural modeling research on the
linear and nonlinear use of cues, it is surprising given the relatively strong
emphasis in the process tracing literature on the development and measurement of a variety of specific strategies (conjunctive, elimination by
aspects, additive difference, linear, lexicographic) that a decision maker
might use. A number of studies in this review discussed specific strategies
in the introduction to their papers only to rely on presenting and describing their results of the study in terms of the more general concepts of
compensatory and noncompensatory strategies. Certainly, results at this
level of specificity are easier to report and to cumulate across studies.
Nevertheless, this reporting practice may also reflect the difficulty researchershave in reliably coding responsesto clearly distinguish between
the various strategies. More attention to the measurementissues relevant
to operationalizing specific decision strategies is clearly warranted.

105

Two substantive conclusions are derived from the review of the empirical evidence. First, from an overall perspective, the results firmly demonstrate the extensive use of noncompensatory strategies in completing
the problem task. In most studies, the nonlinear use of cues was the
dominant mode of decision making identified by the researchers. Compensatory strategies (linear, additive difference) were used when the number of alternatives and dimensions were small or after a number of task
stimuli were eliminated from consideration. The use of various noncompensatory strategies were found with the conjunctive strategy as the most
frequently reported strategy. The results indicate that process tracing
studies are providing different types of information than the results of
research using a structural modeling approach. This conclusion supports
the contention by Pitz and Sachs (1984) that the simple test of the linear
model is not sufficient when one is interested in the processes the decision
maker used in arriving at a decision.
Focusing more specifically on the determinants of strategy use, a second substantive conclusion is that the most robust findings associated
with the set of studies reviewed is that task complexity is strongly related
to strategy use. The research indicates that as the number of dimensions
and alternatives increase, there is a greater likelihood that the decision
maker will use nonlinear strategies. This finding has been found with
different types of samples (students, consumers, professional staffs), different types of tasks (housing decisions, consumer product decisions,
evaluations of others), and across both verbal protocol analysis and information board approaches to process tracing. As stated by Payne (1982)
information processing in decision making seems to be highly contingent
on the demands of task. Some evidence of the contingent nature of the
decision making process as a function of other task characteristics (e.g.,
display format, type of decision) has also been found. Research that is
needed to further improve our understanding of contingent effects is described in the last section of the discussion.
Methodological Issues
This review of the process tracing research indicates that there are a
number of methodological issues that need to be addressed. The methodological issues which can have implications for understanding decision
behavior include the labeling of the alternatives presented to decision
makers, the intercon-elation of cues, the type of decision required, the
coding of decision strategies, the quality of the decisions made, and the
relation of process and structural modeling approaches.
Labeling of the alternatives. Most process tracing studies provide subjects with a matrix which lists a number of alternatives and dimensions.
The labels of the alternatives are often quite meaningful to decision mak-

<-----Page 31----->106

FORD ET AL.

em. Consequently, the information in the matrix must either confirm or
disconfirm the decision makers’ preconceived notions about the alternatives. Yet, the effects of labeling alternatives on decision behavior has
been relatively ignored in the literature.
Experiments using unlabeled alternatives would allow for the examination of how preexperiment notions affect information search and decision strategy. An unlabeled condition would also allow an assessment of
how subjects learn about alternatives. Some studies reviewed involved
situations in which subjects probably had little prior information about
alternatives while others involved products or decision objects about
which subjects may have known a great deal. Given that prior knowledge
of the decision object has been shown to affect depth of search and
strategy use, it is reasonable to believe that preconceived notions about
one or more alternatives would also have an effect on information search.
Cue intercorrelation. Until recently, process tracing researchers have
ignored issues regarding cue level, cue values, and the intercorrelation of
cues. The intercorrelation of cues has been shown to be a significant
factor in research using structural models of decision making (e.g.,
Schmitt & Dudycha, 1975a, 1975b).
Johnson and his colleagues (Johnson, 1985; Johnson et al., 1986; Payne
et al., 1986) have begun to assess the effects of cue structure on decision
processes using process tracing approaches. Payne et al. (1986) manipulated cue values and found effects on strategy that confirmed an earlier
report by Johnson (1985) that decision makers paid more attention to cues
with extreme values. Hypotheses derived from cognitive psychology including script theory (Abelson, 1976, 1981; Payne, 1982) regarding the
effects of prior knowledge on the use of information that conflicts with
preconceived notions or experience need to be developed and tested.
While a similar suggestion has been made (Payne, 1982), no researcher
has framed his/her research within the framework of script theory.
Type of decision. Another aspect of the task that needs further investigation is the type of decision task required. While structural modeling
approaches ask decision makers to rate or evaluate all alternatives, the
most frequent decision required in process tracing studies has been a
choice from among a set of alternatives. Billings and his associates (Billings & Marcus, 1983; Billings & Scherer, in press) have required both
choice and rating tasks in process tracing studies and have concluded that
the type of decision required affected the search process. Research is
needed to understand why these effects occur and how robust these effects are across different samples and problem tasks as well as under
different task and environmental factors.
Strategy coding. The major strategies examined by researchers have
followed from the initial work by Payne (1976) and Svenson (1979). De-

<-----Page 32----->PROCESS TRACING

107

spite conceptual distinctions among strategies, operationally distinguishing between different types of strategies is a difficult task. We attempted
to code the reliability of this categorization process but few researchers
reported attempts to assess coder agreement. Additionally, many studies
did not report the decision rules used for categorizing individual decision
maker responses into decision strategies. This classification is fairly subjective in the case of verbal protocol analysis and even the use of information boards require judgment if the researcher is to go beyond simply
counting inter- and intradimensional shifts (Payne, 1976) or the total
amount of information searched.
The lack of reliability information suggests that process tracing researchers must pay more attention to error sources (Einhorn et al., 1979)
in their conclusions about strategy use. While time consuming, it is fundamental for researchers to have at least two people code these strategies
and to evaluate the degree to which rules regarding classification of
search patterns into strategies (e.g., conjunctive, lexicographic) are reliable. It may also be useful to develop a continuous measure of the degree
of linear use of information rather than to continue using categorical or
nominal measurement of information search strategies.
Decision quality. Process tracing research has found that various task,
environmental, and person characteristics affect the types of search processes and strategies used by decision makers. From a more pragmatic
perspective, the contingent nature of decision making that has been demonstrated is important to the extent that such behavior has an effect on the
quality of the decisions made (e.g., see Jacoby, Speller, & Kohn, 1974).
The examination of the linkage of strategy and decision quality requires
the development of decision problems with an identifiable high quality
alternative (e.g., see Jacoby et al., 1984). Such research could lead to
techniques for improving the effectiveness of the decision process in order to enhance decision quality.
Process tracing and structural modeling approaches. One reason for
the development of process tracing methods was to investigate the process of decision making with a method which focused on behavior occurring while the decision task was being performed rather than inferring
such behavior from the outputs of the decision process. The results of our
review indicate that process tracing approaches demonstrate the nonlinear use of information while structural modeling approaches have highlighted the linear use of cues. Yet, only a few studies have directly compared the two methods (Billings & Marcus, 1983; Einhom et al., 1979)
although several authors (Einhom & Hogarth, 1981; Payne et al., 1978;
Svenson, 1979) have called for multiple indices of the decision process.
Billings and Marcus (1983) suggest that process tracing and structural
modeling measures lack convergence because they represent different

<-----Page 33----->108

FORD ET AL.

stages of the decision process. Process tracing examines the information
acquisition process while structural approaches examine the integration
or combination of information into decisions. They suggestthat decision
makers may use different processesor decision strategies during the two
stagesof decision making. Einhorn et al. (1979)contend that both process
tracing and structural models provide valuable insights but of a different
nature. They suggest that the detailed level of process tracing analysis
often precludes the use of large numbers of subjects or even decisions
which would allow for estimation of error in judgments about strategy
use. For example, regression analyses can provide estimates of systematic and error variance in judgments. The relative importance of a particular cue in affecting judgment is difficult to determine in a process tracing
model, but regression weights and the intercorrelation matrix can provide
some of this information. Alternatively, the results of a process tracing
study may serve to better inform one regarding the types of nonlinear
effects to include in a regression analysis.
Einhom and Hogarth (1981) also indicate that the disagreement between subjective and statistical weights (Schmitt & Levine, 1977)may be
more informatively investigated by a combination of process tracing and
statistical modeling. Disagreement can occur because (1) people do lack
insight, (2) people attend to but cannot use cues that lack variance, (3)
cues to which attention is not paid are correlated with others such that the
cues not attended to receive inappropriate statistical weights. Use of both
approaches can tell us whether disagreementbetween statistical and subjective weights is an artifact of the statistical modeling procedures.
Theoretical

Perspective

Researchers have noted that process tracing research has mainly been
devoted to a descriptive approach to decision making rather than the
explication of theory (Pitz & Sachs, 1984;Svenson, 1979).Future process
tracing research can be more productive in explaining cognitive processes
if research is more closely tied to psychological theory (Ogilvie &
Schmitt, 1979).
A number of researchers have highlighted the utility of examining decision making behavior from a cost/benefit perspective (Beach & Mitchell, 1978; Einhorn et al., 1979; Einhom 8z Hogarth, 1981; Newell & Simon, 1972;Payne, 1982).A cost/benefit analysis is a rational perspective
to decision making in which the selection of a decision strategy is seen as
a complex function of a compromise between a desire to make a correct
decision and a desire to minimize cognitive effort. Benefits, which include
the probability that a decision strategy will lead to a correct decision,
must be balanced against costs such as time, effort, and other resources
that the decision maker resists expending (Christensen-Szalanski, 1978).

<-----Page 34----->PROCESS TRACING

109

This perspective assumes that the more formalized or analytic the decision strategy, the higher the probability that a “correct” solution can be
generated. Conversely, strategies differ in costs with more formal, compensatory strategies seen as costing more to use than simpler noncompensatory (rules of thumb) strategies.
Beach and Mitchell (1978) have developed the most comprehensive
cost/benefit analysis framework for understanding the conditions under
which decision makers choose different strategies in dealing with decision
problems (Payne, 1982). This contingency model of decision making hypothesizes that the choice of strategy is a complex function of the characteristics of the problem or task, the task environment, and the personal
characteristics of the decision maker. The components of the Beach and
Mitchell (1978) model are described below and the research testing hypotheses generated from the model are presented. The research using
process tracing approaches is placed within this framework to highlight
issues that need to be addressed in process tracing research.
Task characteristics. Beach and Mitchell (1978) posit that the problem
or task characteristics that have the greatest impact on decision behavior
include complexity, ambiguity, and instability of the decision task (for
purposes of the present review, task familiarity or the degree to which the
decision maker has had past experience with the decision problem is
discussed as a person characteristic). Task complexity is defined as the
number of alternatives and/or dimensions in the decision problem and the
degree to which the outcome of the decision task influences future decision problems. Task ambiguity is concerned with the clarity of the goals
of the task to the decision maker while task instability is defined as the
degree to which the structure of the task changesand the extent to which
these task changes can be predicted by the decision maker.
An examination of the process tracing studies reveals that the effects of
only one of these characteristics, task complexity, have been studied.
Process tracing studies have demonstrated that increases in task complexity are related to the use of simplifying, noncompensatory strategies.
From a cost/benefit perspective, Onken et al. (1985) suggest that this
increase in complexity results in an increase in the amount of cognitive
strain and that therefore, the benefits of reducing that strain through
simplifying strategies becomes more salient.
An analysis of the judgment and consumer tasks used in process tracing
studies indicates that the task of the decision maker (regardless of the
level of task complexity) has been to gather and process information
about fixed alternatives and to make a rating or choice from among those
alternatives. Abelson and Levi (1985)have described these kinds of tasks
as “well- defined.” In well-defined tasks, the objectives to be attained in
the task, the available alternatives, and their associated outcome proba-

<-----Page 35----->110

FORD ET AL.

bilities are clear to the decision maker. With ill-defined tasks or problems,
the decision maker does not have a clear idea of the goals to be obtained
or of the alternative available choices (Abelson & Levi, 1985). Consequently, uncertainty, or the inability to assign specific probabilities to
outcomes, is one of the critical components of an ill-defined decision
problem.
As noted by Simon (1976), it is useful to consider tasks as on a continuum in terms of how much uncertainty (or task structure) is faced by the
decision maker. Returning to the Beach and Mitchell model, the characteristics of task ambiguity and instability relate to uncertainty as they
focus on the clarity of the goals and the structure of the task. Research
testing propositions from the Beach and Mitchell model suggestthe utility
of examining the effects of task characteristics such as ambiguity and
stability on the decision process. For example, Stein (1981)found that the
ambiguity of the task (defined as solvability of the task) was positively
related to the search for possible solutions. Waller and Mitchell (1984)
found that stability of the task affected the use of nonanalytic or more
complex analytical strategies.
Future process tracing research needs to expand the tasks examined to
incorporate different degreesof task structure. A cost/benefit perspective
states that a critical component in the selection of a decision strategy is
the calculation of probabilities associated with decision outcomes. With
increases in uncertainty, these probabilities are more diEcult to determine. An important research issue, therefore, is the examination of
changes in search processes and strategy use by decision makers as task
uncertainty increases (due to the level of task ambiguity, instability, or
other task factors).
Environmental characteristics. Beach and Mitchell (1978) suggest that
the key factors relevant to the environment surrounding the decision task
include the irreversibility of the decision, the significance of the task, the
accountability of the task to the decision maker, and the time and/or
money constraints on the decision process. For example, the model suggests that when decisions are irreversible (holding other aspects constant), decision makers will tend to use more complex, analytical strategies.
Few studies using process tracing approaches have attempted to measure or manipulate these factors or examine their effects on the decision
process. As the exceptions, Billings and Scherer (1988), Klayman
(1983, and Williams et al. (1985) manipulated task importance (significance) and found some, albeit small, impact on strategy use. In two
studies, Payne, Bettman, and Johnson (1986) found that time pressure
impacted on the use of strategy with more use of noncompensatory decision strategies under high time pressure.

<-----Page 36----->PROCESS TRACING

111

Since most process tracing studies have not examined the effects of
environmental factors on decision behavior, they, in effect, have held
these factors constant in the design. A closer examination of the process
tracing studies reveals that the typical decision environment included
situations in which the decision task was of low significance and where
the accountability of the decision maker was low (e.g., students recruited
for a laboratory based study of decision making in which there were no
consequencesto the decision maker as a function of the decisions made).
Monetary issues were rarely incorporated into the studies and for most
studies the decisions appear to be mainly under self-imposed pressures of
the decision maker to complete the experiment as quickly as possible.
Based on the environmental characteristics which typify the process
tracing studies, the Beach and Mitchell model predicts that decision makers would tend to use simplifying, noncompensatory strategies. There are
few incentives (low task significance, no accountability, no monetary
rewards for optimal decision making) in the decision environment to increase the perceived “benefits” for making a more rigorous analysis so
that a more “correct” or accurate decision could be made. The results of
the studies in this review support these predictions as many studies found
evidence for the use of simplifying strategies. Whether the results are due
to characteristics of the task such as complexity, a basic tendency of
decision makers to use simplifying strategies, or more a function of the
task environment cannot be determined from the present research efforts.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that studies which have tested the
Beach and Mitchell model have found that environmental factors can
have a major impact on strategy use. For example, MacAllister, Mitchell,
and Beach (1979)found that allowing or not allowing the decision maker
the option to change his/her decision (decision irreversibility) affected
strategy use and perceptions of the task. Subjects with an irreversible
decision task used more analytical decision strategies, perceived more
task pressure, and rated the problem as more important than when the
decision was reversible. In addition, MacAllister et al. (1979), Stein
(1981), and Wailer and Mitchell (1984)have found similar effects on strategy use, perceived task pressure, and perceived task importance by manipulating the significance of the task (decision makers were told that the
decision was an important one to the company or were told that the
decision would not affect the operation of the company). MacAllister et
al. (1979) also found that situations in which the person perceives him/
herself as personally accountable for the results of the decision result in
the selection of more analytic decision strategies. Based on the results of
this research, it appears our understanding of the decision making process
through the use of process tracing approaches would be enhanced by
testing and expanding the notions of the Beach and Mitchell model as

<-----Page 37----->112

FORD ET AL.

related to the effects of environmental characteristics on decision strategies.
Person characteristics.
The person characteristics of the decision
maker that may affect decision behavior include the decision maker’s
knowledge about the available strategies and their relative promise of
success, the ability to exercise that knowledge, and the motivation to
expend a certain amount of effort on the decision task. For example, a
highly knowledgeable, cognitively complex, motivated individual is more
likely to use more complex, analytical, compensatory strategies than decision makers who are on the other end of the continua. Unfortunately,
only one study has been conducted that specifically explores the Beach
and Mitchell model as related to person characteristics. ChristensenSzalanski (1980) compared decision processes of students who were
skilled or unskilled in mathematics and found that the unskilled group was
less confident in their decisions and took more time to solve the decision
problems. Nevertheless, the results indicated that there were no differences in strategy selection between the skilled and unskilled groups.
An examination of the process tracing literature indicates that few person characteristics have been examined. The knowledge base of the decision maker has rarely been systematically examined and in these cases,
knowledge has been operationalized as prior experience with consumer
products (e.g., Bettman & Park, 1980;Butcher & Scofield, 1984;Hoyer &
Jacoby, 1982; Jacoby et al., 1978) rather than as knowledge of decision
strategy alternatives. The studies which have examined the cognitive ability of the decision maker (Capon & Davis, 1984; Jacoby et al., 1984;
Klayman, 1985)have found that ability has a limited influence on decision
strategies. A systematic examination of the motivation of the decision
maker has basically been ignored in process tracing research.
Despite the lack of empirical support for the effects of person characteristics on the decision process, it is intuitively appealing to consider
strategy selection as a function of the knowledge, ability, and motivation
of the decision maker. For example, given the focus of process tracing
studies on strategy use, it would be useful to closely examine how knowledgeable decision makers are of the alternative decision strategies available to them. Structural modeling studies have had a strong interest in
how knowledgeable decision makers are of their own strategy use (e.g.,
weights given to various dimensions in deriving decision outcomes). Process tracing research needs to determine how knowledgeable the decision
maker is about alternative decision strategies and to determine the extent
to which the decision maker is aware of the strategy chosen to complete
the assigned task. In this way, the process by which decision makers
“trade off’ costs and benefits,in the completion of an assigned task can
be more closely studied.

<-----Page 38----->PROCESS TRACING

113

Interactive effects. The comparison of the process tracing literature to
the Beach and Mitchell model indicates that few factors hypothesized to
affect decision behavior have been examined, Theoretical rationale and
empirical evidence suggeststhat testing the propositions developed from
the Beach and Mitchell model using process tracing approaches can increase our understanding of the decision making process. Nevertheless,
Beach and Mitchell (1978) provide only a preliminary guide as to how
these three components of task, environment, and person characteristics
interact to affect the decision process. An examination of the process
tracing literature also reveals a disregard for testing the interaction of
multiple components within a single study. Klayman (1985) is the only
study which attempted to systematically examine the effects of task (complexity), environment (task importance), and person (mental ability) characteristics within a single study.
While some studies examined multiple factors in a study, more work
needs to be focused on determining which factors should be studied in
combination and what the impact of those factors on the decision process
might be. For example, while researchers have suggestedthe importance
of cognitive ability, little empirical evidence of its affect on decision behavior has been found. From an interactive perspective, it becomes evident that the tasks being utilized when testing the effects of cognitive
ability on strategy use have been well-defined and structured tasks. We
posit that cognitive ability should have more of an impact on the decision
process and decision outcomes the more uncertain or unstructured the
task becomes. The examination of this effect requires that the structure of
the task be varied and its interactive effects with various levels of cognitive ability be determined. More conceptual work as well as empirical
research is obviously needed in this area.
Conclusion

In this review, we have attempted to summarize the growing body of
literature using process tracing approaches to the study of decision making. Substantive conclusions derived from this literature have been presented and several methodological issues that could contribute to improving the rigor of the research have been outlined. We have used the Beach
and Mitchell model of decision making to provide an integrative framework and a guide for future research directions. Pitz and Sachs (1984)
concluded their review of decision making research by stating that despite
the promise of the process tracing approaches, it is not yet possible to
define the conditions under which particular decision strategies will be
used. Our hope is that this review of the literature will lead to a more
focused research direction which develops the promise of the process

tracing approaches for increasing our understanding of individual decision
making behavior.
