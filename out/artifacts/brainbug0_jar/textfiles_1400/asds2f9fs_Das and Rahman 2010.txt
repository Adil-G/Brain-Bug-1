Abstract
Purpose We present a comprehensive framework of the
key determinants of partner opportunism in strategic
alliances.
Design/methodology/approach We propose an extended
definition of partner opportunism and three categories of
the determinants of partner opportunism based on a review
of the literature. These categories comprise economic
factors (equity involvement, asymmetric alliance-specific
investments, mutual hostages, and payoff inequity), relational factors (cultural diversity and goal incompatibilities), and temporal factors (alliance horizon and pressures
for quick results).
Findings The framework of determinants makes clear
how the various determinants of partner opportunism may
be differentially salient in the three major alliance types,
namely, equity joint ventures, minority equity alliances,
and nonequity alliances.
Implications Based on the framework, a number of
propositions are developed to facilitate empirical research
on partner opportunism. Managerial implications flowing
from the proposed framework are also discussed.

Originality/value Although scholars in various disciplines have studied the general topic of opportunistic
behavior, our understanding of partner opportunism in
strategic alliances appears to be fragmented and inadequate. As partner opportunism is acknowledged as a significant threat to alliance survival and success, a
comprehensive framework of the key determinants of such
opportunism should improve our understanding of this
phenomenon and to also provide an impetus for future
research. The article also responds to the need of alliance
managers for a framework of key factors that are responsible for partner opportunism so that they may be able to
deploy appropriate deterrence mechanisms to minimize
opportunistic behaviors.

Introduction
For large corporations as well as small entrepreneurial
firms, strategic alliances are becoming more and more a
necessity for ensuring a competitive edge in the marketplace. Strategic alliances are ‘‘interfirm cooperative
arrangements aimed at achieving the strategic objectives of
the partners’’ (Das and Teng 1998, p. 491). A high percentage of alliances that are formed, however, end up as
failures (see Das and Teng 2000, for a discussion of possible causes). Clearly, a member firm in an alliance faces
certain adversities that are unique because, unlike an
independent firm, it is subject to relational risk vis-à-vis its
partners in addition to the usual business risks. The

123

<-----Page 1----->56

literature recognizes the deleterious role that a partner
firm’s opportunistic behavior plays in alliances, often
resulting in their unplanned termination. Thus, partner
opportunism is of paramount concern to an alliance firm
engaged in collaborative activities.
Researchers have studied the impact of opportunistic
behavior in business for decades. According to Williamson
(1975, p. 9), opportunism ‘‘refers to a lack of candor or
honesty in transactions, to include self-interest seeking
with guile.’’ In the context of strategic alliances, opportunistic behavior includes ‘‘breaking promises, not sharing
resources or facilities as per agreement, bluffing, lying,
misleading, misrepresenting, distorting, cheating, misappropriating, stealing, etc.’’ (Das and Rahman 2001, p. 43).
However, scholars in economics, management, marketing,
and sociology have generally treated opportunism as an
undifferentiated phenomenon. It is only very recently that
some researchers have directed their attention to exploring
the essence of opportunism (e.g., Ghoshal and Moran 1996;
Wathne and Heide 2000). There is a need to understand
more adequately as to what increases the potential for an
alliance partner to act opportunistically in different situations. We believe that a wide-ranging analysis of the
determinants of partner opportunism would help in
understanding its complex nature and in gaining better
insights for managing such opportunism.
We divide the remainder of the article into four parts.
First, we examine the origins and nature of partner
opportunism. Second, we suggest an overarching framework of determinants of partner opportunism comprising
three distinct sets of factors: economic, relational, and
temporal. We identify and examine a list of significant
determinants constituting the framework. Third, we discuss
the differential salience of these determinants in each of the
three major alliance types: equity joint ventures, minority
equity alliances, and nonequity alliances. Lastly, we suggest directions for further research and indicate some of the
more significant managerial implications of the proposed
framework of partner opportunism.

The Nature of Partner Opportunism
In this section, we briefly review the literature on the
general concept of opportunism and then suggest, specific
to the field of strategic alliances, a comprehensive definition of partner opportunism as a prelude to proposing a
framework of its determinants in the next section.
In their efforts to delineate the character of opportunism,
scholars have mentioned various activities that reflect the
phenomenon. According to Williamson, for instance,
‘‘opportunism refers to the incomplete or distorted disclosure of information, especially to calculated efforts to

123

J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

mislead, distort, disguise, obfuscate, or otherwise confuse’’
(1985, p. 47). We give below several examples of partner
opportunism in alliances to indicate broadly its nature and
variety.
Consider, for example, the alliance between Red Dragon
Enterprises of China and Batrionics, an Australian manufacturer of industrial batteries (Rarick 2004). Batrionics
was interested in setting up an operation in China after
having established itself in Taiwan. Rex Adams, representing the Australian company, located a potential Chinese partner in Red Dragon Enterprises, a manufacturer of
a variety of batteries. The quality of the Chinese products
was not acceptable but Adams ‘‘felt that he could leverage
his company’s knowledge and skill against a joint venture
partner’’ (Rarick 2004, p. 3). In due course, a joint venture
was formed, but a number of problems emerged, including
poor manufacturing quality, missing inventory, and lack of
finance. Adams accused Tsang, his Chinese counterpart, of
behaving opportunistically. In his eagerness to set up an
operation in China, Adams was perhaps less than thorough
in assessing the risks of opportunism.
Another illustrative case concerns Cameron Auto Parts
(B), a North American company, and its UK licensee
(Crookell and Beamish 2006). Alex Cameron had gone to
the UK to meet his licensee and to France to meet an
important customer, Michelard. The UK licensee was
interested in partnering with Cameron in establishing a
manufacturing facility in Australia. Alex Cameron, however, went on to have a verbal agreement with his French
customer to invest 40% in a factory manufacturing flexible
couplings that was acquired by the latter. Angered at this
development, the UK licensee charged: ‘‘I thought you had
your head screwed on better than this, Alex. You realize
this makes us competitors. Michelard of all people! They
run that business in their spare time. You’ve made a damn
fool of yourself over there’’ (Crookell and Beamish 2006,
p. 7). To the UK licensee, Cameron had committed an
opportunistic act. To placate his UK licensee, Cameron
agreed to the original proposal to set up a joint venture in
Australia.
Yet another form of opportunism is evident in the
decision of the Spanish telecommunications company,
Telefonica, to suddenly discontinue its participation in the
alliance with Bidland Systems, a small U.S. firm that
provided dynamic e-commerce. This is considered opportunistic because Telefonica abandoned the alliance after it
had appropriated ‘‘Bidland’s proprietary business-to-business auction and dynamic e-commerce business information and technology through the promise of a lucrative joint
venture and investment contract’’ (Business Wire 2000). In
this case, the contractual provisions were helpful to Bidland to proceed against Telefonica ‘‘for breach of contract,
breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the Uniform

<-----Page 2----->J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

Trade Secrets Act, among other charges’’ (Business Wire
2000).
Clearly, since strategic alliances are between two or
more firms, they create the circumstances where opportunism is possible. Thus, given especially its ubiquitous
presence, opportunism in strategic alliances deserves much
more study than it has garnered so far. In that research
enterprise, we believe that both a careful analysis of the
definition of partner opportunism and then an inquiry into
its origins are necessary.
Opportunism involves activities generally characterized
as fraudulent, deceitful, and obfuscating. It is easy to see
that partner opportunism conflicts with partner cooperation
(Das and Teng 1998, p. 492). Indeed, partner opportunism
goes against the development of mutual trust and the
cooperative spirit, accentuating the perception of risk and
jeopardizing the interfirm relationship (Das and Teng 2001,
2004). Masten (1988, p. 183) considers moral hazard and
haggling as opportunism.
As a further refinement, Ghoshal and Moran (1996)
distinguish opportunistic attitude from opportunistic
behavior, arguing that the latter is the behavioral manifestation of the former, and offer a set of psychologically
oriented factors that influence opportunistic attitude (pp.
18, 21). Scholars have also pointed out certain kinds of
behaviors that should not be characterized as opportunism.
According to John (1984, p. 278), ‘‘hard bargaining,
intense and frequent disagreements, and similar conflictual
behaviors do not constitute opportunism.’’ Wathne and
Heide (2000) further clarify that ‘‘situations in which (1)
the parties jointly agree to modify an agreement or (2) one
party receives compensation in some form’’ and ‘‘situations
in which parties adjust contract terms ex ante in anticipation of shirking’’ should not be considered opportunism
(p. 38).
Some attempts have been made to devise a classification
for the extensive inventory of activities that pertain to
opportunism. Griesinger (1990, pp. 486–487) categorizes
opportunism into three groups—dishonesty, infidelity, and
shirking. In a more systematic approach, Wathne and
Heide (2000, p. 41) categorize opportunism into four
groups: evasion, refusal to adapt, violation, and forced
renegotiation. These studies, however, do not attempt to
understand the roots of opportunism.
It would appear that most scholars accept Williamson’s
compact definition of opportunism, ‘‘self-interest seeking
with guile,’’ in their research on related topics. The literature on the subject of opportunism is devoted to research
questions that can be considered peripheral to the actual
phenomenon of opportunism. There is a dearth of studies
on the basic concept of opportunism and, consequently, our
understanding of the complexities of partner opportunism
in strategic alliances remains inadequate.

57

Our own review of the research points to two key
deficiencies in the extant literature. First, most of the
research seems to be based on the classic definition offered
by Williamson (1975), mentioned earlier, with no particular exploration of its implicit assumptions. Thus, we have
yet to adequately capture the complex nature of partner
opportunism in alliances. Second, the extant research on
the determinants of partner opportunism points to the need
for an integrated approach. We will now propose a definition of partner opportunism and then present, in the next
section, an overarching framework of its determinants.
As we stated earlier, opportunism has been aptly defined
by Williamson as ‘‘self-interest seeking with guile’’ (1975,
p. 9). While this definition is parsimonious in scope, it
highlights only two attributes of opportunism: self-interest
and guile. It leaves certain attributes of opportunism
implicit, allowing researchers to interpret variously what
constitutes opportunism. In the following paragraphs we
make explicit the significant attributes of opportunism,
supplementing the definition of Williamson.
Based on a recognition of the assumptions implicit in
Williamson’s definition, we define partner opportunism in
a somewhat more extended form as behavior by a partner
firm that is motivated to pursue its self-interest with deceit
to achieve gains at the expense of the other alliance
members. This elaborated form of the Williamson definition of opportunism, as applied to alliances, has five major
components: behavior, motives, self-interest seeking,
deceit, and gains at the expense of others. First, we
examine opportunism as a behavior, so that opportunism
refers to specific actions by an opportunistic alliance
partner. This is consistent with the extant literature (e.g.,
Joshi and Stump 1999; Luo 2007a; Wathne and Heide
2000). For instance, Wathne and Heide (2000, p. 36)
observe that ‘‘the concept of opportunism, as currently used
in the literature, includes a broad range of potentially different behaviors.’’ Our definition is not concerned with the
opportunistic attitude or propensity of the partner because
our focus is on actual opportunistic behavior.
Second, the definition suggests that conscious motives
are involved in opportunism. In other words, opportunism
is deliberate, not accidental. If the partner firm inadvertently brings harm to the focal firm in pursuing its selfinterest, it is quite likely to make amends for it. It is only
when such harmful behavior has been consciously engaged
in that the partner will be unlikely to compensate for
damages. The motives of the opportunistic partner eventually lead to opportunistic action. Prior research on strategic alliances has not explicitly considered motives as an
essential element in understanding partner opportunism.
Third, partner opportunism takes place to gratify selfinterest. There is a general consensus among scholars that
opportunism involves some form of self-interest seeking

123

<-----Page 3----->58

(Ghoshal and Moran 1996; Wathne and Heide 2000; Williamson 1975, 1993). We note that the nature of the pursuit
of this self-interest by an alliance partner can take two
alternate paths. First, the opportunistic partner could seek
to acquire the focal firm’s rightful share of the alliancespecific gains. Second, the opportunistic partner could shirk
its own alliance-specific obligations, foisting the relevant
costs onto the focal firm. Both these approaches would
serve the self-interest of the partner, even as they also
adversely affect the focal firm.
Fourth, we should note that simple self-interest seeking
is not tantamount to opportunism. It is critical for an
opportunistic partner to keep its actual motives deliberately
hidden from other alliance members. Thus, a partner firm
must use deceit to conceal and mask its actual motives.
Whereas Williamson (1975) uses the term ‘‘guile’’ in discussing opportunism, we prefer the more accessible term
‘‘deceit’’ to convey the same notion (Das 2005).
Fifth, we must recognize that seeking self-interested
gains by a partner firm that does not affect the focal firm in
any adverse way does not fall within the ambit of partner
opportunism. This would be so even if the partner’s actions
were not entirely above board. Such partner behavior must
also, somehow, result in gains that are at the expense of the
other members of the alliance. Note that the two paths of
self-interest seeking that we mentioned above also leave
the other alliance members worse off.
We suggest that the observations of various authors in
the literature on what constitutes partner opportunism in
alliances can be subsumed within the contours of our
proposed definition. By adopting this expanded definition,
we provide a general basis for the further study of partner
opportunism in a rigorous manner, recognizing the multifaceted nature of the phenomenon.

Framework of Determinants
To facilitate a better understanding of the nature of partner
opportunism and advance empirical research, we believe an
analysis of the determinants of opportunism is essential.
We list in Table 1 some illustrative observations from the
literature on the determinants of both the general topic of
opportunistic behavior and the particular issue of partner
opportunism in strategic alliances. Our review of the literature indicates—and the table reflects this—that the
research on the determinants of partner opportunism thus
far has been largely fragmented, so that it seems desirable
to attempt an integrated approach.
According to John (1984, p. 287), ‘‘opportunism can be
viewed usefully as an endogenous variable that is evoked
by certain determinants within a long-run relationship. In

123

J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

other words, individuals may not always behave opportunistically even if conditions permit such behavior.’’
Scholars in economics, management, and marketing have
proposed a number of factors that influence the incidence
of opportunism in alliances. We examined the nature of
these factors and concluded that they can be usefully
grouped according to the nature of the process through
which they influence partner opportunism.
Recently, Lee (1998, pp. 337–338) tested a set of three
antecedents of opportunism—decision-making uncertainty,
cultural distance, and economic ethnocentrism—and found
empirical evidence in support of them. Sako and Helper
(1998, pp. 393–394) used customer-specific assets, lack of
reciprocity, and uncertain market and technology environments as antecedents of the supplier’s perception of
customer opportunism, while Joshi and Stump (1999,
p. 346) used only technological unpredictability as a
determinant of opportunism.
Provan and Skinner (1989, p. 205) find dependence and
control of decision making to be predictors of opportunism.
Nooteboom (1996, p. 999) lists different external events that
may trigger opportunistic behavior. Also, Wathne and Heide
(2000, p. 42) note that the focal firm would be vulnerable to
opportunism under conditions of information asymmetry
and lock-ins. Finally, according to John (1984, p. 281), an
alliance member would be more likely to act opportunistically if it felt coerced by another alliance member.
We may note here that explicit cooperation-building
mechanisms are likely to impact upon the determinants
of opportunism. For example, Gulati (1995) shows that
familiarity breeds trust, a fundamental requirement for
cooperation. Hence, familiarity between alliance members
may temper opportunistic tendencies.
Clearly, not all firms behave opportunistically all the
time. Following Williamson’s reasoning, firms refrain from
opportunism when the resultant losses (i.e., loss of image,
goodwill, legal retribution, etc.) are expected to be greater
than the potential economic gains. The problematic feature
of this conceptualization is that it renders opportunism to
be a monolithic phenomenon. Because a partner may act
opportunistically for a variety of reasons, the focal firm
needs to be wary of all such possibilities. It would thus
seem useful to formulate an appropriately sophisticated
view of the concept of partner opportunism.
Our analysis yielded three distinct groups of determinants, each group influencing the potential for partner
opportunism in its distinctive way. Accordingly, we propose in this section three sets of key determinants that
significantly impact upon the potential for partner opportunism: economic, relational, and temporal. We should
note that most of these determinants have been empirically
supported (see Table 2).

coercive attributions also have a deleterious effect on attitudinal orientation which in turn leads to more

involvement with another channel member’’ (p. 280). ‘‘When perceptions of increased formalization,

‘‘Opportunism is influenced by three factors. The first is ‘‘prior conditioning’’ (relationship ‘‘i’’) that includes all
the attitudes and values formed through exposure to conscious as well as subliminal stimuli … Second,
opportunism is influenced by what we describe as the ‘‘feeling for the entity,’’ which represents the
individuals’ favorable or unfavorable assessment of the specific transaction partner, the group or the
organization… The third influencer of opportunism is opportunistic behavior.’’ (p. 2)

Perceived asymmetry in commitment increases perceived conflict.
It is argued that perceived conflict leads to fears of opportunism.

Resource commitment is the most objective form of commitment.
Actual asymmetry in resource commitment will increase the
perceived asymmetry in resource commitment.

Alliance-specific investments directly affect asymmetry in resource
commitment. It increases dependence, which in effect reduces the
dependent firm’s potential for opportunism. Conversely, the less
dependent partner has a higher potential for opportunism.

Mutual hostages pave the way for credible commitments, strengthening
interfirm relational bonds. Also, by acting opportunistically a partner
would lose the assets that are held hostage by the focal firm. Hence,
mutual hostages decrease the potential for partner opportunism.

Results are significant in the opposite direction from the hypothesized

investments can lead to higher potential for opportunism as well.
This supports the notion of paranoid concerns about making asymmetric
resource commitments, which increases the potential for opportunism.

It is assumed that alliances with a shared R&D component will
have a higher likelihood of partner opportunism. Findings
suggest that a firm apprehending partner opportunism will
prefer equity structure for its alliance.

While partner’s equity involvement leads to focal firm perceiving
less partner opportunism, the effect is not substantial. Nevertheless,
it is possible that equity involvement has a substantial effect
on decreasing the likelihood of actual partner opportunism.

If goal congruence increases interfirm trust, then goal incompatibility
will increase the potential for partner opportunism in alliances
(assuming trust and opportunism are inversely related).

Differences in cultures, in general, are negatively related to alliance
performance. More specifically, however, only select dimensions
of uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation negatively
influences alliance outcome. It is implied by the authors that
alliance survival is threatened due to relational difficulties
(one specific form of which is partner opportunism).

Ensuring equitable outcomes in alliances is considered just as important
as attaining economic efficiency. Since alliance members are keen on
preserving equity, partners perceiving payoff inequity will strive to
bring back equity to the alliance. Subtle forms of opportunistic behavior
(e.g., shirking) offers a quick way to resolve perceived inequity in the
alliance.

We take the focal firm’s perspective and analyze the
potential for opportunistic behavior by its partner, so that
an increase in the level of a particular determinant (as it
relates to the partner firm) would be likely to increase/
decrease partner opportunism. In Fig. 1 we present our
framework of determinants of partner opportunism.
Economic Determinants
The economic determinants of opportunism are the most
widely acknowledged in the literature, but especially so in
transaction cost economics (Klein et al. 1978; Masten
1988; Williamson 1975, 1979, 1993). Scholars maintain
that an alliance partner’s opportunism is shaped by economic considerations (e.g., Klein 1996). An alliance partner is driven by the need to procure economic benefits or to
avert economic losses. When such needs are acute, an
alliance partner may harm other alliance members in furtherance of its own economic self-interest. The larger the
potential economic gains to be made, the more an alliance
partner would be driven toward opportunism. Thus, ‘‘even
among the less opportunistic, most have their price’’ to
give in to opportunism (Williamson 1979, p. 234). The
presence or absence of these factors can restrict or facilitate
a partner in opportunistically pursuing its economic selfinterest. As a group, we call these factors the economic
determinants of partner opportunism. The set of economic
determinants comprise equity involvement, alliance-specific investments, mutual hostages, and payoff inequity.

‘‘Partners demand quick results in the short run and tend
to be less patient with long-term investment and
commitment. Consequently, alliance performance
evaluation will rely heavily on financial and marketbased indicators.’’ (p. 59)

scrutinized for quick returns.’’ (p. 102)

Remarks

Pressures for quick results are very real in most alliances. Many firms
are unable to cope with such pressures for various reasons. Since opportunism offers a clear-cut and quick way to reap substantial benefits
(albeit through unfair means), these firms have a higher potential to act
opportunistically to respond to the pressures for quick results.

J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

Broadly, alliance structural arrangements can be either
equity-based or nonequity-based. Equity alliances are considered more effective than nonequity alliances in curbing
opportunistic behavior (Das and Teng 1996; Gulati 1995)
because equity binds member firms to the alliance, making
it difficult for them to withdraw easily. A partner firm will
not jeopardize its alliance relationship by exploiting the
focal firm’s alliance-specific investments if it has an equity
stake in that alliance. Similarly, if both firms contribute
known shares of equity in their alliance, they would be more
accepting of asymmetric resource commitments.
Equity is generally expressed in monetary terms. The
equity invested in the alliance would get tied up with
ongoing operations for an indefinite period of time and,
thus, cannot be readily retrievable. In fact, a partner would
have to depend on the focal firm’s cooperation to withdraw
its equity stake from the alliance. Plainly, a partner
behaving opportunistically with the focal firm cannot
expect cooperation from the focal firm in the withdrawal
process. Thus, opportunism creates problems for the partner
in recovering its equity stake in the alliance. The value of

the tied-up equity that an opportunistic partner risks losing
would raise the required threshold of economic gains from
opportunism.
Proposition 1 The extent of equity involvement will
be negatively associated with potential for partner
opportunism.
Asymmetric Alliance-Specific Investments
In alliances, members often have to develop facilities or
acquire assets that are useful and valuable only within the
specific alliance context. The rationale for investing in
alliance-specific assets is to achieve higher efficiency in
alliance operations. However, as an unintended consequence, a focal firm investing in these alliance-specific
assets becomes dependent on its partner’s cooperation in
the alliance. If there is a low level of dependence on the
focal firm, the partner will be more likely to behave
opportunistically, since it ‘‘can more easily shift to other
suppliers or provide critical services on their own than can
their highly dependent counterpart’’ (Provan and Skinner
1989, p. 205). Asymmetry in actual resource commitments
may affect the perceived asymmetry in commitment.
Indeed, as Ross et al. (1997) observe, ‘‘in the principalagent context it may be discomfiting or disadvantageous
for the perceiver to believe that it is overcommitted relative
to its counterpart because this belief may create fear of
opportunism’’ (p. 683; emphasis in original).

123

Generally speaking, a focal firm becomes vulnerable to
partner opportunism when it invests in alliance-specific
assets. This is because there would be sufficient scope for
the opportunist to misappropriate the quasi-rents generated
from such investments. As Klein et al. (1978, p. 298)
emphasize: ‘‘After a specific investment is made and such
quasi rents are created, the possibility of opportunistic
behavior is very real.’’ If the opportunistic partner were to
leave the alliance, the focal firm would likely lose the
alliance-specific value of its assets. Hence, as long as the
loss of abandoning the alliance is greater than the loss
incurred due to partner opportunism, the focal firm will
have to continue to be a part of the alliance. The opportunistic partner, in turn, would try to ensure just enough
reward for the focal firm to dissuade it from severing ties.
If a focal firm believes its commitment to the alliance to
be greater than that of the partner firm, it might perceive a
higher potential for partner opportunism, but especially so if
the focal firm happens to be a small firm or an entrepreneurial firm (Das and He 2006). A firm’s apprehension of
opportunistic behavior by the partner may be exacerbated
when it has ‘‘paranoid concerns and fantasies about the
long-term lack of equity in the transfer of knowledge and
capability’’ (Gould et al. 1999, p. 697). By a similar logic, a
partner firm will also be apprehensive about possible
opportunistic behavior by the focal firm if it believes that its
own resource commitments are greater than that of the
focal firm. This heightened apprehension will, in turn, lead
to an increase in the partner’s potential for opportunistic

<-----Page 10----->J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

behavior. In other words, the fear of the focal firm’s
opportunism may increase the partner’s own potential for
opportunistic behavior. The focal firm should understand
this logic, and realize that just as it apprehends opportunistic
behavior by the partner, the partner may in turn also fear
opportunism from the focal firm in situations of asymmetric
investments. Accordingly, the asymmetry intrinsically adds
to the potential for partner opportunism.
Proposition 2 Asymmetric alliance-specific investments
will be positively associated with potential for partner
opportunism.

65

The partner firm will react opportunistically to restore
equity when it perceives inequitable allocation of alliance
gains. Alliance firms tend to work in an intertwined fashion, often to such an extent that it becomes impossible to
objectively account for each partner’s contribution toward
the alliance’s performance. Ambiguity in measuring each
member’s performance would complicate the problem of
payoff inequity. The greater the perceived inequity, the
higher will be the potential for opportunistic behavior by
the partner.
Proposition 4 Payoff inequity will be positively associated with potential for partner opportunism.

Mutual Hostages
Relational Determinants
The idea of using mutual hostages by alliance members is
not new as a means of expressing credible commitment and
deterring partner opportunism. Mutual hostages serve as a
guarantee against defection (Williamson 1983). Alliance
firms can hold mutual hostages by exchanging their
respective critical resources with counterparts. The type,
amount, or value of resources to be used as hostages (e.g.,
equity, know how, personnel) can be explicitly stated as
contractual provisions. In this context, Hwang and Burgers
(1997, p. 105) assert that ‘‘mutual commitment offers a
way of enhancing the robustness of cooperation and
diminishing the attractiveness of defection.’’
Clearly, mutual hostages would thwart partner opportunism even when the focal firm makes alliance-specific
investments. Such hostages would also reduce the perceived asymmetry in resource commitments, since credible
commitments are established by both alliance members.
Finally, mutual hostages would artificially reduce the level
of private benefits for the opportunist, since it would have
to forgo its own hostage investment. This would yield a
low private to common benefits ratio, effectively decreasing the potential for partner opportunism.
Proposition 3 Mutual hostages will be negatively associated with potential for partner opportunism.
Payoff Inequity
Partners often perceive their gains from the alliance to be
inequitable compared to those of the focal firm. Following
equity theory (Adams 1963), the partner that perceives its
rewards as inequitable would be driven to assure a sense of
equity. Often, this may be accomplished by resorting to
opportunistic behavior. We are, of course, concerned here
only with under-compensation as a form of inequity. An
over-compensated partner firm will have no motivation for
behaving opportunistically. It is only when the partner feels
under-compensated that it will seek to even out the payoff
arrangements through non-cooperative means.

The second set of determinants of opportunism is relational. Ghoshal and Moran (1996) note that a partner’s
feeling for other alliance members would affect that partner’s opportunistic attitude, which would lead to opportunistic behavior. The relational determinants influence
partner opportunism in three general ways. First, a relationship that lacks interpartner legitimacy (Kumar and Das
2007) can act as a sanction for a partner to be less sensitive
to the well-being of other members. Therefore, an opportunistic partner would not feel guilty or even be concerned
about the focal firm being adversely affected by its
opportunism. Second, when an alliance partner feels
coerced by the focal firm in some way, it would be likely to
consider a response to the coercion. An atmosphere of
interpartner harmony (Das and Kumar 2009a) is breached,
thereby making way for partner opportunism. Third, the
lack of an intimate relationship could easily give rise to
misunderstandings, thereby provoking partner opportunism. The relational determinants of opportunism discussed
here are cultural diversity and goal incompatibilities.
Cultural Diversity
Cultural diversity among alliance members is a common
phenomenon. Although most research on cultural diversity
in alliances has been in the context of cross-national alliances
(e.g., Johnson et al. 1996; Kumar and Das 2009; Meschi and
Roger 1994), alliance firms from the same country may also
have very distinct organizational cultures (Harrigan 1988).
However, regardless of the source—be it national or organizational—cultural diversity creates relational issues in
alliances. Firms from different cultures see the strategic
behavior of their partners through different lenses, since
‘‘different cultures are likely to interpret and respond to the
same strategic issue in different ways’’ (Schneider and De
Meyer 1991, p. 307). Thus, the chances of misinterpreting
the partner’s actions are high. Contrasting national cultures,

123

<-----Page 11----->66

Brown et al. (1989, pp. 237–238) observe: ‘‘The Japanese
believe the straightforwardness of Westerners is rude and
probably masks deceit. Westerners believe the Japanese
inability to come to the point quickly denotes trickery, and
find their negotiating tactics underhanded.’’ In their study of
IJVs, Johnson et al. (1996, p. 83) argue that, in general,
‘‘cross-cultural interaction, often replete with misunderstandings and miscommunication, can foster opportunistic
tendencies.’’
From the focal firm’s perspective, cultural diversity
would be cause for increased partner opportunism for a
couple of reasons. First, the partner firm may react
opportunistically based on a misinterpretation of the focal
firm’s behavior as threatening. According to Brouthers
et al. (1995, p. 23), ‘‘Different cultures have unique time
frames, alternative priorities, and distinctive methods of
saying no. Those managers cognizant of these cultural
differences will not misread partner signals and will
therefore be more successful in their alliances.’’ Misunderstandings due to different cultural values and interpretation mechanisms would hinder communication and lead
to poor interfirm relationship, perhaps provoking the partner into behaving opportunistically.
Second, cultural distance may result in a self-centered,
ethnocentric approach in dealings with alliance members.
Firms would be more likely to hold a positive feeling for a
potential alliance partner with a similar cultural background, whereas they would be more apprehensive about
one with a different cultural background. As Ghoshal and
Moran (1996, p. 21) also observe: ‘‘As shown by Ajzen and
Fishbein (1977) and Eagly and Chaiken (1992), a positive
feeling for the entity would reduce opportunism whereas a
negative feeling would enhance it.’’ Over all, increased
cultural diversity leads to greater potential for partner
opportunism.
Proposition 5 The cultural diversity among alliance
members will be positively associated with potential for
partner opportunism.
Goal Incompatibilities
Goals are incompatible when the pursuit of one hinders the
pursuit of the others. This is different from goal dissimilarity, whereby alliance members have different goals, but
without any problem, because these goals are not in conflict
with each other. Although mutual strategic interests often
bring prospective alliance partners together, their goals can
sometimes be incompatible. According to Hill and Hellriegel (1994, p. 594), ‘‘joint ventures are particularly likely
to be subject to goal conflicts since they are formed by two
or more firms, each with its own set of goals. Ultimately, a
joint venture is measured by the extent to which the venture

123

J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

meets the goals and expectations of the individual partners.’’ In time, alliance relationships may become sour,
filled with bickering and the blaming of each other. When
the attractions of newness in cooperative arrangements fade
away and the potential for disputes becomes apparent,
alliance members ‘‘may feel compelled to retreat from
interactions, withhold information, and safeguard personal
interests’’ (Gassenheimer et al. 1996, p. 77).
Self-interest seeking may encourage deceit when goals
are not aligned. When goals are compatible, each member
can pursue its own interests without harming those of the
others. In that case, mutual self-interest seeking becomes
possible. However, when alliance members’ goals are
incompatible, a partner firm trying to accomplish its own
goals may seem to behave in an uncooperative manner.
‘‘Firms involved in alliances must have goals that support
each other, not compete with each other. Competitive
goals, such as ‘get all you can,’ are counterproductive
and result in alliance failure’’ (Brouthers et al. 1995,
pp. 21–22). Thus, the focal firm is likely to perceive its
partner’s actions as opportunistic when goals are incompatible. An alliance partner would harm the focal firm if it
pursues self-interest when the focal firm’s goals are
incompatible. Opportunism yields no risk of loss for the
partner, for the focal firm’s goals would not benefit
the partner anyway. Thus, the relational tension would
increase—and the relational bond would weaken. A partner
would feel less restraint against opportunism. Thus, conflict
is very likely when alliance firms have incompatible goals.
As a consequence, as Cullen et al. (1995, p. 95) observe,
‘‘Conflict erodes trust, increases the potential for opportunistic behavior, and reduces the likelihood of partners
dedicating necessary idiosyncratic assets to the relationship.’’ Disagreement over goals may also lead to dissatisfaction with the relationship, to the detriment of the
cooperative spirit. Dissatisfied alliance members will be
less likely to feel committed to each other or to the alliance, thereby increasing the likelihood of opportunism.
Proposition 6 Goal incompatibilities among alliance
members will be positively associated with potential for
partner opportunism.
Temporal Determinants
The third set of factors determining partner opportunism is
concerned with the time dimension. Alliances differ in
their intended duration of existence. A short duration
would elicit a different partner behavior, with scope for
easy exit after opportunistic gains, compared to a long
duration, in which the partner has to continue dealing with
the focal firm for some period of time. Also, temporal
pressures can motivate a partner to behave in ways that it

<-----Page 12----->J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

would not do under ordinary conditions. For instance, the
sense that operating results need to be achieved in an
accelerated manner can cause a partner to worry excessively and to resort to desperate measures (i.e., opportunistic actions) to meet deadlines. The notion that partner
opportunism may arise from temporal determinants has
been proposed recently by Das (2006). We need to be
careful here to exclude factors that merely evolve over
time, and may superficially appear to be temporal in nature
(such as learning races) but are intrinsically economic in
motivation. The temporal determinants of opportunism are
comprised of alliance horizon and pressures for quick
results.
Alliance Horizon
Strategic alliances are inherently temporary. Although
some joint ventures have lasted for multiple decades, the
underlying intention of alliance members during the formation of the alliance is to have an arrangement that would
exist for a finite time period, not a permanent arrangement.
While explicit dates of dissolution are generally agreed on
during alliance formation, some alliances have an indeterminate termination date. Alliance horizon is the duration
an alliance is expected to be in existence, or the intended
time span between the formation of an alliance and its
dissolution.
Alliance horizons can vary in time span from short to
long to open-ended. A short alliance horizon would foster
opportunism, whereas a long alliance horizon would deter
such deceitful behavior. Alliance horizons affect partner
opportunism in several ways (Das 2004, 2006). First, alliance horizons positively impact the length of ‘‘the shadow
of the future.’’ Research suggests that a long shadow of the
future compels a partner to seriously assess the prudence of
engaging in opportunism, for it has to be concerned about
possible repercussions it might have to face in the
upcoming future (Axelrod 1984; Heide and Miner 1992).
Second, during the course of alliance operations, not all
gains can be split equitably between alliancing firms. When
the alliance horizon is long, sufficient time is usually
available for evening out temporary inequities between
alliance members. Therefore, a long alliance horizon would
give a partner confidence that apparent inequities will not
persist in the long run. In such a circumstance, a partner
will not have to resort to opportunism to restore its sense of
equity. Third, having set up a long alliance horizon, a
partner would be more inclined toward preserving the
relationship. According to Ring and Van de Ven, ‘‘in the
temporal development of a cooperative IOR [interorganizational relationship], social psychological processes
will create a separate set of pressures to preserve the
relationship’’ (1994, p. 95). Moreover, continued and

67

supplementary commitments are likely to be high in an
alliance with a long horizon, which would also serve to
constrain partner opportunism.
Proposition 7 The length of alliance horizon will be negatively associated with potential for partner opportunism.
Pressures for Quick Results
It usually takes some considerable time before alliances
start producing results. Das and Teng (1999, p. 59) explain
that ‘‘alliances are time-consuming projects because partner
firms have to learn to work together smoothly and efficiently,’’ so that pressures for quick results during the initial
stages of the alliance may in fact jeopardize the possibilities
of that alliance becoming a profitable venture. However,
firms differ in their preferences: ‘‘One partner may have a
sense of urgency and favor quick results, while the other has
a long-term view and is more oriented towards investments
in financial assets and in building up a relationship with the
partner’’ (Barkema and Vermeulen 1997, p. 849). Also,
firms may have a host of reasons for seeking quick results
from their alliance projects. First, firms often lack the
patience to allow the interfirm relationships to develop, so
that they tend to treat the alliance merely as a one-off
business transaction. Second, a firm may be unwilling to
wait sufficiently long to see the performance results develop
because it does not have the requisite faith in its partner or
in the alliance. Third, a firm may simply not be able to
afford to wait long enough for optimum alliance outcomes,
because substantial resources would remain tied up in the
alliance during such an extended period.
A partner experiencing pressures for quick results may
resort to desperate means to acquire gains from the alliance.
One of the significant advantages of opportunistic behavior
is that it provides immediate results, although it comes at
the expense of potentially greater long-term benefits. Brown
et al. (2000, p. 51) observe: ‘‘A firm behaves opportunistically to increase its short-term, unilateral gains. As a result,
opportunism by one party can erode the long-term gains
potentially accruing to both parties in a dyadic channel
relationship.’’ Because a partner under pressure for quick
results would discount future outcomes at a much higher
rate, the opportunity cost of opportunistic behavior would
appear negligible to such firms and the potential for
opportunistic behavior would be high.
Proposition 8 Pressures for quick results will be positively associated with potential for partner opportunism.
Our discussion of the broad framework of determinants
should, we hope, help in appreciating the multiplicity of
influences that are simultaneously at play in constituting

123

<-----Page 13----->68

J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

partner opportunism in alliances. In particular, the wide
variety evident in the list of determinants attests to the
inherent complexities of partner opportunism. It would be
useful now to explore the differential saliencies of the
various determinants in the three principal forms of
alliances.

Determinants in Different Types of Alliances
The basic distinction among the myriad forms of strategic
alliances is in terms of equity and nonequity alliances. This
simple dichotomy is widely evident in the empirical literature for eminently practical reasons (e.g., Gulati 1995). Of
course, more complex classifications have also been proposed (e.g., Lorange and Roos 1993). However, for our
purposes here, we follow a somewhat parsimonious categorization of the rich variety of alliances, and use the three
types followed by Das and Teng (1998)—equity joint
ventures, minority equity alliances, and nonequity alliances. Equity joint ventures are the only form of alliances
involving the creation of a third entity. Alliance members
are usually referred to as parents of the joint venture
organization. The parents share the ownership of the joint
venture and influence its strategic direction. Minority
equity alliances are interfirm relationships where a member
holds an equity stake in the partner, or cross-hold equity in
each other. Sharing of ownership reflects a high level of
commitment to the alliance on the part of the alliance
members. Nonequity alliances, as the name suggests, do
not involve any equity or the transfer of ownership. They
are contract-based and contingency provisions in the contract can usually make them quite flexible. Nonequity
alliances do not ordinarily bring alliance members into
close proximity and do not usually foster an intimate
business relationship.
The characteristics of each type of alliance allow certain
determinants of opportunism to become more salient than
others. For an understanding of the dynamics of the various
factors at play, we select and discuss briefly, for each
alliance type, the most salient factor in each of the three
sets of determinants. In Table 3, we indicate these significant determinants of partner opportunism in the three
types of alliances.

Equity Joint Ventures
Among the economic determinants of partner opportunism,
equity involvement appears to be the most prominent in
equity joint ventures. A joint venture requires the parent
firms to invest substantial equity to set up the commonly
owned, independent organization. Therefore, equity
involvement is likely to be an active determinant of
opportunism in a joint venture. Scholars have argued, both
conceptually and empirically, that the more equity an alliance member invests in a joint venture, the less likely it is to
resort to opportunism (Beamish and Banks 1987; Buckley
and Casson 1988; Das and Teng 1996; Gulati 1995). This is
because of the possibility of losing the equity investments
tied up in the joint venture if the partner firm were to get
caught in an opportunistic act and had to face legal or social
consequences. There is added complication if we try to
distinguish between equal and unequal splits in equity
involvement by the members. However, the specific kind of
arrangement that would most enhance the effects of equity
involvement, as a determinant of opportunism, is unclear
from existing empirical findings. Whereas some scholars
have found equal equity involvement to be more conducive
to joint venture success (Bleeke and Ernst 1991; Blodgett
1991), others have found unequal equity involvement by the
parents to be positively associated with joint venture success (Killing 1982).
Of the relational determinants, cultural diversity has the
more important role in equity joint ventures. First, joint
venture parents have to work very closely with each other.
This closeness would reveal the various critical cultural
characteristics of each parent. Hence, also, the cultural
differences are more likely to surface in equity joint ventures than in other forms of alliances. These differences
could be a serious problem, because they could hinder the
tightly integrated work process through poor communication, misunderstanding, and unnecessary provocations
(Glaister and Buckley 1999, p. 127). Research also suggests
that organizational culture differences are more detrimental to interfirm relationships than are national cultural
differences of the joint venture firms (Harrigan 1988).
We observed from our analysis that the temporal
determinants of opportunism would be important in
influencing potential partner opportunism in equity joint

ventures. As the parent firms jointly create a new firm, it is
usually the case that operations would have to continue for
a long period of time to realize net gains. Given the relatively long-term nature of equity joint ventures, alliance
members realize that they would have to work together for
a relatively long period of time. Therefore, firms planning
to form an equity joint venture would generally prefer a
long alliance horizon. Based on our rationale regarding
temporal determinants, a long alliance horizon would have
a significant impact on decreasing the potential for partner
opportunism.
Minority Equity Alliances
Among the economic determinants, asymmetric resource
commitments in the form of alliance-specific investments
would have a strong influence on partner opportunism in
minority equity alliances. When an alliance firm commits
alliance-specific resources, it becomes very vulnerable to its
partner’s potential exploitative intentions. In such asymmetric contributions, one firm is bound to become more or
less dependent vis-à-vis the other firm. A partner that is less
dependent may behave opportunistically because of the
excessive dependence of its counterpart. It should be noted
that the impact of alliance-specific resource commitments
would be strong when such commitments are made disproportionately or one-sidedly, i.e., only by the focal firm.
The problem is more acute in a minority equity alliance than
in an equity joint venture. This is because a partner with less
alliance-specific resource commitments may take advantage of the focal firm’s vulnerability arising from more
resources committed.
Of the relational determinants, goal incompatibilities
appear to be the important influence on partner opportunism in minority equity alliances. Incompatible goals
between alliance members of a minority equity alliance
would be likely to erode relational harmony over time. The
effect of goal incompatibilities is further complicated by
the fact that alliance firms cannot just disband the alliance
on account of the equity stakes they hold in each other. As
dissolving the alliance is not a ready option, a partner firm
would seek self-interest through every way possible,
including opportunism. A partner would resort to shirking,
withholding of critical information, and various acts of
infidelity under such circumstances.
Of the temporal determinants, pressures for quick results
affect opportunism in minority equity alliances. Such
pressures might arise if a partner overlooks the time it
would take to resolve numerous unforeseen problems
within the alliance, before getting into actual performancerelated activities (Das and Teng 1999). Because of the
idiosyncratic nature of the equity tie-up, where a partner

69

cannot just hold back and leave the alliance, a partner
feeling put upon by pressures for quick results would discount long-term results and would be drawn toward shortterm gains. Since opportunism offers the perfect method
for ensuring short-term gains, a partner feeling pressures
for quick results would be inclined toward opportunism.
Nonequity Alliances
A partner is most likely to perceive payoff inequity in a
nonequity alliance. Given the lack of an objective and
tangible basis for distributing income generated from alliance activities (there being no relative equity contribution
by alliance members in a nonequity alliance that can serve
as a basis for distributing residuals), perceptions of payoff
inequity can exist. Reacting to its perceptions, a partner firm
may resort to opportunistic behavior to regain a sense of
equity.
Of the relational determinants, goal incompatibilities
could be potent in breeding opportunism in nonequity
alliances. In this type of alliance, member firms usually do
not have to interact closely in carrying out alliance tasks.
Thus, they are not exposed to each other’s organizational
culture, diminishing the saliency of cultural diversity as a
relational determinant of opportunism. However, an alliance partner might find it convenient to breach the principle of exclusivity that forms part of the contracts of
nonequity alliances. Griesinger (1990) characterizes this
form of opportunism as infidelity.
Of the temporal determinants, pressures for quick results
are common in nonequity alliances. Firms start off with
this type of alliance to test the waters before engaging in
more deeply involved business relationships. An alliance
partner feels the pressures for quick results because realizing alliance outcomes quickly lets it decide on possible
extension of the existing alliance. Unfortunately, a lack of
time often yields less than satisfactory results, prompting
the alliance partner to behave opportunistically to secure
self-interests.

Discussion and Conclusion
Theoretical Contribution
We noted from a review of the literature that our understanding of partner opportunism in strategic alliances has
generally been inadequate. In this article we attempted to
contribute to the literature by proposing an overarching
framework of determinants of potential partner opportunism. We began by suggesting an encompassing definition of
partner opportunism as a basis for better understanding and

123

<-----Page 15----->70

study of the phenomenon. We then identified a comprehensive set of determinants comprising three categories of
factors: economic, relational, and temporal. These determinants were discussed individually to better understand
the rationale for a partner firm to behave opportunistically.
We followed this up with a brief examination of the
differential saliencies of these determinants in three major
types of alliance settings, namely, equity joint ventures,
minority equity alliances, and nonequity alliances. This
kind of analysis should eventually assist mid-range theorizing consistent with our contingency approach.
A striking—and unexpected—insight that emerged from
this exercise is that minority equity and nonequity alliances
seem to be prominently influenced by very similar kinds of
determinants of partner opportunism (see Table 3).
Although these two types of alliances have different economic determinants, they have the same relational and
temporal determinants. The overall array of the determinants in minority equity and nonequity alliances are in
clear contrast with the list of determinants in equity joint
ventures. We believe this difference maybe due to the
fundamental distinction between an equity joint venture,
which involves the creation of a third entity by the member
firms, and the other two forms of alliances, which involve
no such third entity. Thus, the mostly similar sets of critical
determinants in minority equity and nonequity alliances,
and a quite different set of determinants in equity joint
ventures, suggest that perhaps we should adopt a new
perspective in research concerning partner opportunism in
alliances. Whereas extant empirical studies have routinely
contrasted equity and nonequity alliances (i.e., treating
equity joint ventures and minority equity alliances together
as one cluster), such categories may not be the most conceptually sound way of grouping alliances for purposes of
testing hypotheses relating to partner opportunism.
Accordingly, we suggest that it would probably be useful to
distinguish joint ventures from all other forms of alliances,
minority equity and nonequity. This would facilitate more
focused research on partner opportunism, especially in
light of the specific sets of salient determinants in the three
different alliance forms discussed here.
As an extension, we would speculate that there might
indeed be reason for entertaining the notion that other
relevant constructs in alliance research—such as confidence in partner cooperation, relational risk, interfirm trust,
and partner control—might also be better examined
through the dichotomy based on creation or otherwise of a
third entity rather than on the basis of equity versus nonequity. Our discussion also, of course, suggests a fortiori
that a three-part categorization, giving minority equity
alliances a distinctive status along with the other two,
would be warranted in all research where alliance variety is
of interest and focus.

Limitations and Future Research
The framework of determinants of opportunism proposed
here may be augmented with other factors. We mention
briefly a few other candidates for determinants, each of
which can be included in one of our three categories. For
example, a partner firm’s embeddedness in a dense network
ensures good behavior (Hill 1990), since opportunistic
behavior with the focal firm will become known to all
networked members, who are in a position to collectively
impose social sanctions on the opportunistic firm. Relational embeddedness (i.e., the extent of direct relationship
between two firms) and structural embeddedness (i.e., the
structural position of the firm in the network) reduce the
potential for partner opportunism within the context of
sparse and dense networks respectively (Rowley et al.
2000). Relational embeddedness reduces the potential for
opportunism that can occur due to a lack of relational
harmony. Hence, we would include this factor in the category of relational determinants. In contrast, structural
embeddedness reduces the potential for opportunism by the
threat of sanctions that could result in substantial economic
losses for the opportunistic partner. Thus, this factor can be
placed in the category of economic determinants.
Furthermore, John (1984) found that coercion is related
to the perception of partner opportunism. Thus, a focal firm
that feels coerced by the partner would perceive its partner
to be opportunistic. This type of opportunism arises from a
lack of relational understanding and feeling of antipathy
toward the supposedly coercive partner. Thus, we would
categorize this factor under relational determinants.
While there may be other factors that can be thought of
as determinants of opportunism, we believe that all these
will consistently fit into the three-category framework we
have proposed here. Doz et al. (2000) reviewed nine latent
constructs that play significant roles in making up the initial conditions of alliance formation. Some of the latent
constructs they review may influence the incidence of
opportunism once the alliance gets underway, e.g., similar
interests, domain consensus, escalation of commitment,
continuity of expectation, and learning. Similar interests
allude to less goal conflicts (Doz 1996; Larson 1992),
thereby reducing the potential for opportunistic behavior.
Seeking domain consensus implies ‘‘efforts to produce
consensus by sense making and understanding processes
undertaken during negotiation processes. … Potential collaborators need to reach meetings of the mind not only
intellectually and strategically, but also culturally and
ethically’’ (Doz et al. 2000, p. 241). Thus, domain consensus can foster cultural blending as well as common
alliance objectives for member firms, which effectively
would reduce the probability of partner opportunism, and
can thus be included among relational determinants. This is

<-----Page 16----->J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

also true of the construct of escalation of commitment,
which would tend to reduce the likelihood of the alliance
partner behaving opportunistically, as relational bonds
between alliance firms grow stronger over time.
The construct of continuity of expectation has time at its
core (Telser 1980). A partner’s expectation of continuing
the alliance relationship is subsumed in the notion of alliance horizon, which is one of the temporal drivers of
opportunism that we have introduced in this paper (see also
Das 2004, 2005, 2006). While Doz et al. (2000, p. 242)
argue that difficulties in learning and adapting initial conditions invite spiraling conflicts between alliance members,
that issue is more about adaptation than learning. Partner
opportunism can also be associated with the learning race
in alliances (Hamel 1991). Learning races conjure up the
probability of a partner outlearning a focal firm (Das and
Kumar 2007). In such circumstances, the faster-learning
partner would be in a position to find ways to advantageously back out of the alliance, violating the spirit of the
alliance contract. This kind of partner opportunism, stemming from learning races, would belong in the economic
determinants category.
An interesting question is whether partner opportunism
may be associated with exogenous factors, such as demand
uncertainty and technological uncertainty. Clearly, these
factors limit the probability of accomplishing alliancespecific goals, thereby increasing the performance risk of
alliances. However, such conditions have no direct effect in
triggering non-cooperative behavior (i.e., partner opportunism). Nevertheless, economic hardship, arising from
exogenous factors, can make economic drivers of opportunism more salient. That is, a partner’s desire to acquire
economic benefits through opportunistic behavior may
increase when the general economic conditions are not
favorable (i.e., under conditions of high demand and
technological uncertainty). Therefore, these exogenous
variables may positively moderate the relationship between
economic determinants and the potential for partner
opportunism.
Future research would also need to explore the role,
generally, of various moderators that could affect the
potency of the three categories of determinants of partner
opportunism. For instance, the financial standing of a
partner firm may have a moderating effect on the impact
that some of the economic determinants may have on
opportunism. A partner with a weak financial standing
would have a dire need for economic gains from the alliance and would accentuate the influence of the economic
determinants. In terms of the relational determinants,
industry similarity between alliance members may have a
moderating role. Alliance members from similar industries
would more likely understand the managerial styles of their
counterparts. Thus, even if conflicts or misunderstandings

71

occur, the impact on partner opportunism would be much
less when alliance members come from the same or similar
industries. In the case of the temporal determinants, the
preferred planning horizon of a partner firm may have a
moderating effect. A partner’s long-term goal (e.g., building market share) would be in alignment with a long alliance horizon but at odds with a short alliance horizon (Das
2006). Similarly, a short-term primary goal (boosting the
stock price) would probably enhance the function of
pressures for quick results in partner opportunism. Furthermore, it would be useful to study how particular
determinants of potential partner opportunism may have
selectively conspicuous roles in specific alliance developmental stages (Das and Teng 2002a). The temporal aspects
of alliances and their intersection with potential partner
opportunism may also have critical significance in alliance
development.
As academic inquiry of the role of partner opportunism
extends into the emerging areas of alliance research, it
would be fruitful to explore how the various determinants
discussed here would be modified in the case, for example,
of multi-partner alliances. Having much more complex
internal dynamics because of indirect reciprocity among
the members (Das and Teng 2002b), it would be reasonable
to expect that the relational determinants, in particular, in
this type of alliance will have the more prominent part.
Renewed attention is needed for examining the changing
functional impact of partner opportunism in the increasingly micro-behavioral approaches that are being adopted
for studying alliance functioning, such as interpartner
legitimacy (Kumar and Das 2007), interpartner sensemaking (Das and Kumar 2009b), interpretive schemes (Das
and Kumar 2009c), and the socio-cognitive motivational
principle of regulatory focus (Das and Kumar 2009d). For
instance, it seems that alliance firms with a promotion
regulatory focus will be more tolerant of their partners’
opportunistic behavior than alliance firms with a prevention regulatory focus. When this contingent view of the
sensitivity to partner opportunism is considered in conjunction with the different stages of alliance development,
an obvious research task would be to seek a fine-grained
appreciation of the comparative influences of the different
categories of determinants of partner opportunism across
all developmental stages and alliance types.
Managerial Implications
Our discussion here has important managerial implications.
The comprehensive approach to the determinants of partner
opportunism should help the manager of the focal firm to
evaluate systematically the circumstances that may
increase or decrease the probability of the partner firm
acting opportunistically. Thus, managers of the focal firm

123

<-----Page 17----->72

would be in a better position to assess the risk of an alliance engagement with a particular partner.
Alliance managers have at their disposal a set of tools to
ensure the smooth functioning of the alliance. These tools
are related to the functions of alliance managers and to
ongoing operations. The unique feature of these managerial
tools is that they are all geared toward restricting the scope
of partner opportunism. The key tools to deter and control
potential partner opportunism comprise monitoring, budgeting, and participatory decision making (Das 2005; Das
and Rahman 2001, 2002).
Monitoring is useful in detecting signs of the partner’s
opportunistic behavior by closely observing the activities
of the partner within the alliance context. At a conceptual
level, we would argue that the probability of being exposed
as an opportunist would sometimes be sufficient in dissuading the partner from misbehavior. Close monitoring
can identify shirking even when performance measurement
is ambiguous. The focal firm can also use this mechanism
when the partner has a reputation for defecting. In the
alliance context, budgeting covers the allocation of
resources to alliance members to enable them to perform
designated tasks. Budgets financially restrict wasteful
behavior by the partner. Since a minimum level of performance is expected within specific budget constraints,
misrepresentations or delivery of sub-standard goods
would very likely get detected. Therefore, budgets can
effectively put a leash on an ill-reputed partner’s conduct
within the alliance. As a managerial tool, participatory
decision making involves bringing in representatives of all
member firms to make decisions regarding alliance goals,
maintenance, operations, performance, and the like. It also
bridges the gap in values, understanding, and communication between partners. Furthermore, when alliance
members share in decision making, the inequity perceived
by each member can be readily addressed. For these reasons, participatory decision making will decrease the
potential for partner opportunism.
Depending on the potential for partner opportunism, the
focal firm would be able to use the optimally efficient
combination of deterrence mechanisms to curb the incidence of opportunism (Das 2005). In particular, managers
may be able to select specific mechanisms that would be
appropriate for controlling partner opportunism generated
primarily by each of the three types of determinants. For
instance, if the focal firm is apprehensive of partner
opportunism that is driven predominantly by cultural
diversity (a relational determinant), it might well emphasize employee training designed specifically to foster sensitivity to cultural differences and institute trust-building
processes.
In summary, we hope this article contributes toward
a better appreciation of the factors that account for

123

J Bus Psychol (2010) 25:55–74

opportunistic behavior of partner firms. The framework of
determinants proposed here should facilitate the rigorous
study of partner opportunism, thus far inadequately
examined as a problematic and complex phenomenon in
the field of strategic alliances.
