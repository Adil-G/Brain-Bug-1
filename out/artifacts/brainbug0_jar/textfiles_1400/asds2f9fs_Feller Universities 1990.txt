Two issues raised by increased participation
of universities
in equity arrangements
designed to commercialize
faculty research are addressed: (a) the effects that an increased emphasis
on patenting
faculty research and on enhancing
the commercial value of these patents has on the characteristics
of academic
research, net revenue streams, and existing channels through
which academic research enters the market, and (b) processes
of institutional
change and imitation, whereby changes in the
policies of elite research universities
exert competitive
and
emulative pressures on other institutions.
Increased efforts by universities to foster the commercialization of technological
innovations
erodes the singular position
of institutions of higher learning in the United States. Based on
past performance,
there is little reason to expect that a substantial
reallocation
of faculty effort towards commercially
oriented R&D will generate appreciable
net revenues for other
than a select number of universities. These ventures also serve
to shift academic researchers
from the social roles in which
they are most efficient, as suppliers of a collective goodscientific and technological
knowledge.
“Just as very few men are both capable business managers
and ingenious
inventors,
so few are at the same time
ingenious inventors and exalted altruists. Some twenty years
ago a university professor devised a method for measuring
with accuracy the content of butterfat in milk. The device,
if patented,
would doubtless
have yielded him a very
handsome income. The inventor gave it freely to the public,
saying modestly that to do so was but part of his duty as a
servant of the people and it has come into use the world
over. We call his conduct noble; but our very recognition of
its nobility is an admission
of its rarity” (F.W. Taussig,
Inventors and Money Makers (1915) [SS]).

“Indeed, it is a fairly safe test; work that has a commercial
value does not belong in the university” (Thomstein Veblen,
The Higher Learning in America (1917) [64]).

1. Introduction
Universities
are beginning
to move beyond
“new research
and development
alliances
and
partnerships”
and
are entering
into
equity
arrangements
that will further the development
and commercialization
of their faculty’s research.
This new(er) institutional
stance reflects what has
been termed “active technology transfer”, an “aggressive reach into the research laboratory
[where
they] actively search[ing] for commercializable
new
applications
of technology
and then seek[ing] to
develop the product or process, with an associated
business entity, through early stage commercialization” [67, p. 611.
These initiatives
are seen as serving several
constructive
ends. In industries where competition
is characterized
by rapid rates of technological
change, the search for commercially
significant
new knowledge may be closely linked with significant advances
in scientific
and technological
knowledge;
increased
university
involvement
in
commercial
activities may supplement
existing institutional
mechanisms
(e.g. research grants, consulting) through which market signals about the
projected
economic
value of new findings
are
transmitted
to faculty. “Commercialization”
and
academic “contributions”
to scientific and technological knowledge
thus may be joint products
of research;
at a minimum
they need not be
antithetical
activities.
Universities,
within stated policies, already bestow institutional
approval
(and indeed
commendation)
on faculty successes in securing exter-

B.V. (North-Holland)

<-----Page 1----->nal research support and consulting
relationships.
The development
of research teams has already
given the character of “quasi-firms”
to academic
research, with academic scientists often eager and
willing to direct or participate
in R&D programs
aimed at commercial
application
[12]. Richter has
suggested that university
scientists with considerable consulting
practices first incorporate
themselves for tax purposes;
then, having taken this
step, they “. . . easily move beyond ordinary consulting activities,
into additional
entrepreneurial
activities”
[47]. From these perspectives,
institutional participation
in equity arrangements
primarily constitute improved methods of increasing
the relative-shares
that faculty inventors and universities accrue from the economic profits brought
by their cont~butions
to knowledge.
As illustrated, however, by Harvard University’s
plan
to form limited partnerships
that would permit it
to pursue the commercialization
of its medical
school faculty’s research, these initiatives also raise
new issues and compound
others.
In 1982, assessing the appropriateness
of the
university’s growing involvement
with industry in
R&D
partnerships,
Derek
Bok, President
of
Harvard University,
observed that the most controversial aspect of collaborative
partnerships
was
the university’s
decision
to either assist or not
assist its professors in the formation of companies
that would exploit their discoveries. Weighing the
pros and cons of these partnerships,
Bok concluded: “All in all, . . the financial advantages
to
the university
appear
more speculative
than
heretofore
supposed,
while
the dangers
to
academic science from participating
in these ventures seem real and severe” [7, p. 1661. On 15
September 1988 an article in the New York Times
entitled “Harvard
to Seek Research Profits”, reported the following:
“In an important
policy
reversal, Harvard University
has decided to raise
money for investments
aimed at bringing faculty
members’ research to the marketplace
and making
a profit for the school” 142, p. A21]. Under the
reported proposal, Harvard was to raise $30 million from six to eight institutional
investors
in
order to form a series of limited partnerships.
These partnerships
would review research projects
by medical school faculty and identify marketable
developments.
Once the faculty and the medical
school agreed to work with and through
the
partnerships,
these projects would receive further

development
and
commercialization.
Harvard
would receive 10 percent of the companies’ profits
after the initial investors were paid.
This paper focuses on two broad sets of questions that stem from Harvard’s action. ’ One set
relates to the economics
of technological
change,
or more precisely, the effects that changing university participation
in equity arrangements
to commercialize faculty research may have on the role of
universities
as suppliers of scientific and technological knowledge.
Included
within this set are
both macro-level
and micro-level
questions.
The
macro-level
questions
center on whether the assumption by universities
of this expanded role will
increase or decrease the rate at which academic
research, considered
now in the aggregate to encompass all fields of knowledge from all universities, is assimilated
into commercially
marketable
products
and processes.
Underlying
this macrolevel question is the perspective
that the conventional tripartite
distribution
roles of universities,
firms, and government
as sponsors and performers
of basic, applied, and developmental
research do
not represent
an inherently
“natural”
state of
affairs. Rather, these roles represent
an historic
(short-run?)
equilibriunl
that has evolved from an
error-strewn
search by each participat~g
institution for a means to accomplish
its specific objectives.
The micro-level
questions include a consideration of the magnitude
and distribution
among
universities
of net revenues
from technology-

Not considered
in this paper is the relationship
between
more extensive university participation
in the commercialization of intellectual
property
rights and the quality of
graduate
and undergraduate
instruction,
in particular
the
effects faculty involvement
in activities related to commercialization
may have on the time allocated
to instruction.
The character
of the debate concerning
this relationship
is
suggested
on the one hand by Utterback’s
findings that
basic research,
rather than being significant
as a direct
“ plays a critical role in the production
source of innovation.
of knowledge and enters the process of innovation indirectly
by means of education”
[63, p 6223 and Blumenthal
et al.‘s

support believe such
support enhances career opportunities
for students. In contrast. Fairweather.
although noting that “In principle. unlversities can pursue liaisons with industry
while simultaneously attempting
to improve instructional
quality”, nevertheless criticizes academic leaders for ignoring the diversion
of faculty efforts away from instruction
that follows upon
the pursuit of economic development
objectives [13].

licensing operations,
and an identification
of the
(implicit) economic assumptions
contained within
emerging
university
technology-development
strategies and revenue projections.
Second, Harvard’s change, although in many
respects replicating actions already taken by other
universities,
raises questions about the propelling
force and dynamics of institutional
change within
and among research-oriented
universities.
Among
these questions are the following:
(a) To what extent do prevailing
interpretations of current trends in expanded university-industry--government
partnerships-which
tend to
present
universities
as being under inexorable
budget pressures or, in the case of public universities, political pressures to become partners
in a
state’s economic development
thrust [1,53], to take
on expanded
roles in the co~ercial~ation
of
new technology-accurately
reflect the degree to
which universities
are, in fact, masters of their
own fate?
(b) How do changes in missions and policies
diffuse among research-oriented
universities?
One conundrum
warrants attention before these
two questions can be addressed. University movement toward direct participation
in the commercialization
of faculty research runs counter to a
preponderant
set of findings which suggest notable peaks amidst a vaster plain. Academic
research, while contributing
to the rate of technological innovation
in the private
sector either
through the transfer and development
of basic
research findings or as the basis of spin-off firms
[63] has been linked infrequentiy
to commerciahzable products. Nelson, for example, in his review
of the Levin et al. survey of the means by which
firms establish private property rights to R&Dbased knowledge,
writes that: “. . . university
research rarely in itself generates new technology;
rather, it enhances technological
opportunities
and
the productivity
of private research and development, in a way that induces firms to spend more
both in the industry
in question and upstream”
[40, p. 1881. Similarly, Roberts and Peters report
that most technical universities have “little effect,
even few instances of commercially-oriented
information
transfer,
upon
neighboring
industrial
firms” [48, p. 1091. Tomatzky,

“limited evidence of profound
commercialization
success emanating
from the research programs’
studies” [59, p. 241. Larsen and Wigard report
similar findings
in their study of collaborative
R&z D in microelectronics
[24].
The U.S. General Accounting
Office’s survey of
the firms participating
in NSF’s Engineering
Research Centers (ERCs) also ~ghli~ts
how little
firms expect by way of patentable
outcomes from
their support of university
research. Of the 15
reasons listed for the participation
of a company
unit in an ERC, the opportunity
to develop patentable products was the least stated reason, with
only 8 percent of the respondents
(n = 168) rating
it as extremely important
or very important
[61, p.
551. By way of contrast, and serving to highlight
the expectations
of the private sector towards the
commercial
utility of academic research, 89 percent of those surveyed cited the match between
research at an ERC and the firm’s interests as
being important
or very important
to its participation, and 88 percent of the respondents
said that
the ERC was doing state-of-the-art
research that
interested the firms. Also illuminating
the implicit
strategy of many firms was the importance
they
assigned to their ability to multiply research investments
with money
from other ERC participants: 48 percent of the respondents
cited this
factor as extremely important
or very important.
This latter finding suggests that firms invest in
ERGS, as they have in university-based
consortia
or affiliates programs, in order to support generic
research,
a more useful concept
than “basic”,
“ targeted basic”, or even “applied”
research, and
then rely upon their own scientific, technical, and
marketing resources to vie with other firms in the
conversion
of that knowledge
into products and
processes.
Economists
who have studied the processes of
technological
innovation
tend to view cases in
which academic research has directly led to economically significant
technical advances (and thus
either generated or have the potential to generate
sizeable income for the faculty and their home
institutions,
such as the Cohen-Boyer
patent on
gene-splicing)
as infrequent
events that require the
following conditions:
(a) scientific advances that
have “industry-creating”
potential;
(b) a large
(dominant)
role for academic
scientists
as the
source
of this new knowledge;
and
(c) a
(,‘ venture”) capital market willing to invest in the

long-term economic potential of “basic” research.
But these occurrences, widely associated with
scientific, technical, and economic developments
in microbiology and microelectronics (and more
recently in the ferment over superconductivity) are
seen by many scholars as a short-run phenomenon; indeed, to cite the example of the biotechnology industry which precipitated much of the past
decade’s focus on university-industry
R & D
partnerships, industry representatives now note
that patterns of university-industry
arrangements
are shifting away from direct investment in longterm university-based research programs, towards
consulting and contract research [60]. The prominence enjoyed recently by academic scientists in
these selected fields is not unlike that described in
the early technological histories of synthetic chemicals or computers. As B. Williams, writing about
this process in the organic chemistry and electric
industries during 1880-1910,
observed, manufacturers were first dependent on the knowledge of
academic chemists and physicists for the initial
industrial innovations:
“but as the innovations increased and diffused
and the number of graduates increased, the
successful firms established their own research
departments and became less directly dependent on university scientists. Although over the
years the indirect contributions of academic
scientists have grown in importance, industry
became less dependent on their direct contributions” [69, pp. 151-1521.
Williams advances other explanations for the diminishing
prominence
currently
enjoyed
by
academic researchers:
“The final stages of development and design
work leading to innovations normally need to
be conducted in close co-operation with staff in
production and marketing; there are still many
innovations which generate substantial financial losses; and there are still significant differences in the value systems and patterns of
organization which promote success in basic
research and in the use of new knowledge in the
production of goods and services. Given the
current nature of science and technology and
the conditions of industrial innovation, the case
for forcing major changes in objectives and

organizational patterns in the interest of higher
rates of innovation and growth is not strong”
[69, p. 1581.
Something is obviously askew between this analytical and historical recitation and current, quickening trends among research universities toward
active participation in the commercialization
of
faculty-generated research.
The boundary markers that empirical accounts
or economic logic would seem to place on the
extent of the universities’ effective participation in
the commercialization
of academic research are
being moved. Identifiable
legislative and legal
changes affecting the appropriability of intellectual property rights, e.g. the Patent and Trademark
Amendments Act of 1980, and the increased willingness of investors to take risks, provide a plausible a priori case for the economic effectiveness
of these new coordinates, as they successfully serve
to accelerate and/or increase the conversion of
academic research into marketable innovations.
The markers, however, also may be moved by
attitudinal changes akin to speculative bubbles on
the part of entrepreneurial faculty and academic
administrators, and by imitative processes among
universities. In either case, universities, like the
little engine laden with gifts for the boys and girls
on the other side of the mountain, “think they
can” succeed.

2. The economic aspects of university involvement
in the commercialization of research
A university’s “aggressive” technology development strategy involves encouraging (and assisting)
faculty to seek patents for their research more
assertively, and to undertake (relatively) more
patentable research; to more actively seek to
license patents assigned to the institution; and to
enter into more equity arrangements with firms
wishing to commercialize faculty research.
Institutional moves to review and revise patent
and licensing policies are widespread among
American universities [2]. Increased institutional
emphasis on the patenting of academic research
raises at least three distinct, albeit related, items:
(1) the number, rate of increase, and distribution
of university-generated
patents among fields of
knowledge; (2) the income stream generated for

<-----Page 4----->I. Feller / Universities as engines of R & D-based economic growth

universities
through
the licensing
of patents
and/or
participation
in firms that seek to commercialize those patents; and (3) the impacts that
both (1) and (2) have on the characteristics
of
academic
research,
the rate of diffusion
of
academic research into commercial
uses, and the
processes by which this transfer occurs.
That universities
are actively seeking to increase the patenting
activity of their faculty is
manifestly
shown in U.S. patent data, surveys of
organizational
changes within universities,
and the
increased
number
of internal
university
study
groups charged with reviewing and revising institutional patent and technology transfer policies.
U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office data reveal an
increase in the number of patents issued to U.S.
universities. Between 1969 and 1986,4,891 patents,
or 0.9 percent of U.S. origin patents assigned to
nongovernment
organizations,
were identified
as
having been assigned to universities [62]. The National Science Board report, Science and Engineering Indicators-1987,
notes that the rate of increase in patents granted to U.S. universities
and
colleges between 1980 and 1985 “was more than
double the rate of increase in the preceding
5
years; it was somewhat less, however, than the
rate of increase for 1970-75” [35, p. 971. For 1986,
university-held
patents represented
1.8 percent of
total U.S. nongovernment
patenting.
The revenue implications
of this increase in
academic patenting
are as yet unclear. Omenn,
highlighting
some
of the major
university
“ winners”Wisconsin’s
WARF, Indiana’s
share
in stannous flouride patents-has
observed that,
“These examples demonstrate
that the patenting
and licensing route can be effective and, in extraordinary
cases, lucrative”
[43, p. 697). In addition to generating royalty income, and patenting
and licensing programs, in Omenn’s view they also
“
the university’s
objective
of par. . . support
ticipating in the transfer of technology and make[s]
the faculty member highly visible and therefore
attractive for useful and remunerative
consulting
work within the bounds of university rules on time
commitments”
[43, p. 6971. 2 Although
no systematic data are available on license and royalty
streams for any large number of universities, statements of increasing
university
incomes may be
found, with the (gross) amounts
reportedly
received in 1987-88 by Stanford ($9.1 million) [23],
the University of California ($5.4 million), and the

339

University
of Wisconsin
(about $5 million) heading the list [20].
These citations are seen as representing
a new
era of income streams. A buoyant statement from
MIT’s licensing
office, for example, reports an
increase in the number of patent applications
filed
in recent years from 100 to 150, and an increase in
royalty income from $2 million in 1986 to $3.1
million in 1987. This increase, however, is only the
beginning,
with projections
for revenues
from
royalties and equity holdings in firms created to
commercialize
MIT’s patents totalling perhaps as
much as $50 million over the next five years.
Similarly, the University
of Arkansas is projected
as likely to receive “millions
of dollars” by licensing its superconductivity
discoveries [31].
Real as the stated figures may be, astute as
university licensing offices may be, and tantalizing
as future
projects
are, the income-generating
aspects of increased
commercialization
activities
for research universities
as a whole are problematic. The historic examples of university success
stories serve as much to illustrate
the extremely
long odds of attaining
such outcomes as to support the substance
of current
projections.
For
example, the acknowledged
pioneer among universities in the creation of an organizational
vehicle
that captures revenue from faculty inventions
is,
by general
accounts,
Wisconsin’s
Alumni
Research Foundation
(WARF). WARF, established
as “a pioneer not-for-private-profit
instrumentality” in 1925, had by 1985 distributed
over $150
million in research grants and capital facilities to
the University
of Wisconsin,
with its annual contribution
rising to $8.5 million in 1985-86 [70].
Accounts of WARF’s history repeatedly highlight
the fact that its success has been based on a
singular set of circumstances
which would be difficult to replicate today [6]. WARF commenced
operation in 1928 as the assignee of the Steenbock
patent on Vitamin
D irradiation,
which quickly

* Omenn’s

review of the means used to take university
research to the marketplace
also highlights the reversal that
has occurred since 1982, for he further writes: “To be sure,
this approach
(patenting
and licensing)
offers no return
comparable
to the sensational
financial returns enjoyed by
those who have benefited
from the speculative
fever of
venture-capital
investments
and equity holdings during the
past couple of years. However, it is increasingly
apparent
that that fever may have peaked and that the equity route is
not a sure-fire route” [43, p. 6971.

produced
a sizeable royalty stream; it has had
professional
financial as well as research management, with 76 percent of its income through 1985
arising in the form of investment
income.
For present
purposes,
the most interesting
aspect of WARF’s experience centers on the extremely low probability
of faculty research leading
to income-generating
outcomes.
Through
1985,
WARF received 2,426 invention disclosures. From
these came 448 patents, of which 203 (representing
9.5 inventions)
were licensed.
Of the licensed
patents, 100 (representing
76 inventions)
produced
income greater than expenses: ‘“Approximately
a
third of those 76 inventions
have earned less than
$10 thousand
each, another third have produced
between $10 and $100 thousand, and another third
have earned in excess of $100 thousand. Total net
income from patents, 1929-85, is more than $30
million, with 10 patents producing
about 90% of
that income” [70].
Moreover, recent university
statements
regarding their expectations
from increased
patenting
and licensing initiatives emphasize revenue projections alone. Little information
is available on the
costs of securing patent rights (estimated
to be
between $5,0~ to $lO,~OO for U.S. rights alone,
with higher costs entailed for foreign rights) 136, p.
1101, defending patent rights [68], and staffing and
operating
in-house
technology-licensing
offices.
Moreover, the aggregate revenue estimates for any
single university are based on “best case” assumptions of high and steady-state
royalty streams for
the duration
of a patent for a large number of
patents. They make no allowances for the ability
of nonlicensees
to develop alternative
processes,
albeit at a cost [25], and for potentially
rapid
decay rates of appropriable
revenues from patent
holdings in rapidly changing fields of technology
[45]. 3
Although certainly not a controlling example, the experience
of the Connecticut
Product Devdopment
Corporation
(CPDC), the longest-established state government venture to
invest public funds in an effort to develop new products and
create jobs, does serve at least to illustrate the risks and
opportunity costs involved in the efforts of nonprofit organizations to generate revenue through R&D. Between 1972
and 1986, CPDC invested approximately $18 million in state
funds. By 1986, it had entered into royalty agreements with
65 firms, involving 79 products, but over one-half of the
investments had produced no royalties or royalties of less
than 10 percent of the grant amount. The computed net
return on public funds for the entire period was 1.3 percent
[171.

of R & D-hosed economic growth
Other than those found in a number of annual
reports such as WARF
provides,
few data are
currently
available on the distribution
of net income (or loss) among those universities
that conduct their own patent and technology-licensing
activities. The question of the profitability
of university patent
and licensing
activities
takes on
increased importance
due to the increasing
number of members of the American
Association
of
Universities
(AAU)
who
have
reduced
or
eliminated
their use of patent management
firms,
such as the Research Corporation;
established
or
expanded
in-house
technology
transfer/licensing
capabilities;
and increased the number of professional employees.
Treating intellectual
property rights as a profit
center involves the following: (a) increases in the
number of patent disclosures
filed by faculty in
response to changing federal legislation, university
policies, and the climate of the time; (b) increases
in fixed costs as universities
develop the professional and technical
staffs necessary to sift disclosures for subsequent
filings, to file (and defend)
applicants
and patents, to negotiate licenses, and
to actively seek out and negotiate
with venture
capitalists
to create firms which will undertake
further development
and commercialization
work
on institutional
patent holdings;
cc) increases in
variable costs associated with filing (and defending) patents; and (d) increases in the total number
of licenses, with the distribution
and form of
payments
a function of the characteristics
of the
patents and the strategies followed by technologylicensing offices 1161. Shaping university
thinking
in all of this are expectations
of a skewed distribution of returns-that
is, a large number of patents
on which no or little income is received, and a few
“block-busters”
that cover the above increases in
costs and yield substantial
net revenues.
Given the few commercially
profitable
inventions emerging
from those institutions
representing the stellar successes, and the substantial
~nimum
efficient scale of operation
implicit in
the above ch~acte~zation
of costs, there is a
reasonably
high probability
that many universities
in expanded
technology-Licensing
that “ invest”
operations
in order to produce substantial
new
sources of income will find themselves engaged in
an economically
chimerical
pursuit and, indeed,
may find themselves unable to recoup their direct
expenditures.
Bok’s statement
about the speculative nature of the financial advantages
of aggres-

<-----Page 6----->I. Feller / Universities as engines of R& D-based economic growth

sive technology transfer programs to the university
still holds.
But more is at stake than the return on microlevel investment decisions in this new willingness
by universities to participate in the commercialization of faculty research. Profitable or not, an
increased emphasis on patentable inventions and
the commercialization of academic research cannot but affect its characteristics. At least three
effects seem unavoidable given the economic logic
driving these initiatives: (a) a shift in the supply of
academic R&D directed towards questions whose
answers constitute patentable outcomes; (b) a substitution by faculty of a more intensive involvement in post-discovery stages of research (licensability, commercialization) for work on new “scientific” questions; and (c) changes in the terms and
means by which academic research flows to the
market.
2.1. Shift in the supply

of academic

R&D

Academic research may be applied and have
direct relevance to a well-defined industrial problem, as occurs when faculties have industrial support to study “proof-of-concept”
questions such
as: Are a particular set of performance characteristics technologically feasible? A different set of
criteria determine satisfactory answers to academic
and commercial questions. To be commercial, an
innovative technique (product or process) must
not only “work”, but it must do so in a way that
satisfies firm-specific profit criteria, which in turn
rests upon demand and supply conditions relating
to the innovation’s cost-performance
configurations and its placement in the market. What most
serves to differentiate academic from industrial
research is the willingness to take the steps necessary to fill the gaps between technological and
commercial questions.
The disjuncture between and among the activities of academic research, academic patenting, and
profitable innovation is evident in studies of the
frequency and economic significance of patents
flowing from NSF grants in chemistry and engineering. Marcy and Kosloski found that from
1964 to 1977, only 73 of 3,766 principal investigators (PIs) on chemistry grants were listed as named
inventors. These PIs received a total of 95 patents
that could be associated with NSF grants. Few
were found to have economic value: they had

341

limited commercial applicability, presented insurmountable difficulties in protection against infringement, and had no apparent economic advantage over existing processes [30]. A subsequent
study of patents flowing from NSF’s engineering
program found that about 248 patents could be
linked to 4,100 engineering grants; that most of
these patents were without commercial value; and
that of the 18 patents estimated to have commercial value, only 4 had generated royalty income
[54]. The reasons advanced for the lack of commercial value are again straightforward:
no
market; prohibitive development costs; superseded; small market satisfied by simpler devices.
At issue, then, in considering university movement toward the commercialization of faculty research is not that such research to date has yielded
so little in the way of patents, or that these patents,
on average, have yielded so little in the way of
commercial innovations. Rather, it is that to purposively attempt to change these outcomes requires an explicit change in the determination of
academic research priorities. To be more patentable, and a fortiori, to be a licensable patent, requires that researchers incorporate an understanding of the competitive product environments of
future vendors or customers when research questions are being initially formulated [18]. Reformulation of academic research agendas along such
lines is now evident. A redirection of research
priorities can be found in Blumenthal et al.‘s study
of university-industry relationships in biotechnology. Faculty members with industry support were
more than four times as likely as faculty members
without industry funds to report that their choice
of research topics had been affected by the likelihood that the results would have commercial application [5]. This emphasis is being increasingly
championed by university officials. 4
Trade-offs occur in the shaping of research
agendas between those research questions gener-

Asked how the manifold increase in MIT’s royalty revenues
was to occur, John Preston,
director
of the technology
license office, responded:
“We’ve changed the professors’
mentality..
. They’ve started thinking, ‘If I can show commercial results, I’11 have a better shot at raising my research
funds.’ They’ve changed away from pure scientific research”

ated by the dynamics of scientific inquiry, and the
economic logic of licensing arrangements.
University-based patents to this point should be viewed
as events generated by a set of institutions
which
sanction market-oriented
behavior, but which extoll contributions
to scientific fields of knowledge.
Institutional
endorsement
of patent activity, and
more strongly of the pursuit of research lines that
have high(er) probabilities
of generating appropriable income streams, changes the signals as to
what constitutes
productive
allocation
of faculty
time.

2.2. A more intensive involvement
Institutional
involvement
in equity ventures designed to commercialize
faculty research also affects the degree to which faculty members continue certain lines of research rather than move on
to other
subjects
more
highly
esteemed
by
academic colleagues. The nature of the researcher’s
choice is highlighted
by the juxtaposition
of two
statements:
Ziman’s
observation
that “Science
evolves through innumerably
particular
decisions
of individual scientists to undertake specific investigations”
[71, p. 11; and Schlicher’s observation
that the value and terms of licensing agreements
relate to the degrees of technical and economic
uncertainty
surrounding
advances
in knowledge
[55]. With universities
having an increasing
stake
in the economic value of licenses, the institutional
incentives
to foster faculty research
related to
reducing technical and economic uncert~nty
increase as well, even when these lines of research
diverge from “academic
advances in knowledge”.
The implications
of this shaping of academic
research priorities
towards patentable
questions
are not fully evident. As noted in the opening
section, a complementary
link may indeed exist
between the advance of science, applied as well as
basic, and sharper market foci in the framing of
research questions. Blumenthal
et al’s 1986 study
indeed points in this direction as faculties engaged
in biotechnology
research with industry
support
were found to simultaneously
publish at higher
rates, patent more frequently
and participate
in
more administration
and professional
activities
than faculties without such support [5]. But what
is also increasingly
evident is that these initiatives

are introducing
new, market-oriented
determinants into the positing of academic research questions; both directly and indirectly, they are inducing the loss of one of the few defining differences
between
academic
and corporate
researchthe
pursuit of the advancement
of knowledge, largely
unconstrained
by prior filtering through prospects
of comnlerci~izability.
The irony of this redirection,
at least as suggested by historic performance
to date, is that it
may produce few successful commercializable
outcomes. The fact that faculties are induced to shift
their research agendas, to participate
in spin-off
firms, or to collaborate
with limited partnerships,
does not by any means guarantee
that the commercial undertaking
will be successful. It simply
says that an increased number of faculties will be
motivated or encouraged
to make this effort. From
this increased activity, given a “select” combination of academic scientists
and fields of knowledge, undoubtedly
will come some patents that
yield patents streams, most likely of pioneering
ventures,
and some marketable
products.
That
these gains will compensate
for the loss of knowledge (and of purpose) as well as the redirection of
faculty research is more problematic.
Moreover,
this shift towards more potentially
patentable
research runs counter to other trends
within academic research designed to correct the
debilitating
effects that a close identification
with
commercial
needs have had on the quality of
research. Historically,
for example, it was MIT’s
shift away from industrially
focused R&D agendas towards more scientifically
oriented research
that enabled it to simult~eously
attain academic
prominence
and research dollars [55]. More contemporarily,
state agricultural
experiment
stations
have redefined their research agendas in order to
elevate the importance
of “contribution
to the
state of knowledge”
relative to “client
needs”.
This has been done to reinvigorate
the scientific
mettle of their research output (and also to negate
proposals at the national level induced by assessments of the low scientific caliber of land-grant
university
agricultural
research
to shift federal
funding from formula-based
[Hatch Act] patterns
to competitive
grants) [15]. This reorientation
has
involved steps by experiment
station directors to
discourage researchers from working on industryfunded projects perceived to be of marginal scientific quality.

<-----Page 8----->2.3. Changes in knowledge flows
Universities are treating two goals- tighter
coupling of academic research, and commercial
introduction in order to enhance U.S. intemational competitiveness and increased royalty incomes-as
inherently compatible, whereas in fact
they are not. U~versity involvement in equity
arrangements creates new market conduits through
which academic research flows to the market. This
involvement fosters “privatization of research’“,
the distinguishing characteristic which, according
to Nelson, serves to differentiate the private from
the public aspect of technological knowledge [41]
and which may compete with existing flows of
knowledge.
Von Hippel, for example, has noted several
examples in the field of scientific instruments in
which university scientists, the “users”, were responsible for the development of innovative techniques. They were then active in speeding the
diffusion of their innovation, first because “(as
required by the mores of science) innovating users
(researchers) published their research results and
the details of any homebuilt apparatus used ‘to
attain them. Second, they typically also info~ed
others of their innovations by presentations at
conferences and visits to the laboratories of other
scientists” [66, p. 181. This information was then
rapidly assimilated by other scientists or by commercializing firms. Evidence of the flow and importance of academic research to technological
innovation also is found in Mansfield’s recent
study in which 76 firms in 7 m~ufactu~ng
industries reported that 11 percent of their new
products and about 9 percent of their new
processes commercialized between 1978 and I981
could not have been developed (without substantial delay) in the absence of recent academic research [291.
The existing tracks upon which academic research flows to the market are likely to become
blocked if not broken apart as universities limit
existing flows of info~ation
in order to divert
faculty findings to specific fiims. At stake is far
more than issues such as temporary delays in the
publication of faculty research in order to give
corporate sponsors an opportunity to file patent
applications. Stallman has noted, for example, that

“Traditionally,
W.S. public breeders have discussed promising new varieties while still testing and have exchanged promising germ plasm
at all stages of development. Both public and
private sector breeders have commented that
the public sector interest in patenting has
limited this flow of information and germ
plasm. All breeders express concern that this
will retard the development of new knowledge”
I571.
The result is likely to be lower rates of technological innovation.
Moreover, universities are not the only party to
collaborative arrangements that are capable of
changing patterns of behavior. Privatization by
universities of the flow of academic research reduces the incentives that firms currently have to
support R&D consortia and affiliates’ programs.
A key to the willingness of individual firms to
support those university-based consortia addressing basic research or generic applied research
questions, and publishing their findings in the
open literature, is the firms’ respective assessments
that they are better able to internally assimilate
and use this info~ation
than nonmembers 1341.
The pursuit by universities of licensing initiatives through designated limited partners reduces the lead time subscribers to a universitybased consortium have in the commercialization
of scientific advances, and reduces their incentives
to become members. Conversely, it provides them
with increased incentives to develop new institutional ~r~gements
for conducting generic research, such as indust~-based
consortia or contracts with for-profit R&D firms. It would be
premature to project comparative revenue streams
and rates of technology transfer from existing and
new arrangements, but what certainly appears
likely from these considerations is the high degree
of substitutability among them.

3. Insti~tion~

change

U.S. public and private universities function in
a constant state of flux, reflecting in good part
their “openness” and “responsiveness” to national
needs. Different perspectives of the missions of
higher education-mental
discipline, utility, re-

<-----Page 9----->search, and liberal culture-have
historically vied
for primacy in shaping the content
of the curricula, as well as the criteria to be used in faculty
recruitment,
promotion
and tenure,
and the
organizational
structures
within which academic
programs are conducted [65]. Almost reflexively, a
national “crisis” requiring generation
and utilization of knowledge leads public officials to turn to
universities
as an appropriate
and effective source
of assistance and/or causes universities
to present
themselves as repositories of requisite and relevant
expertise.
Contemporary
debates on the influence of economic signals on the direction
of academic
research have long-standing
antecedents,
as represented by the Taussig-Veblen
contretemps.
In this
respect, recent initiatives for and by universities
to
take on expanded roles in fostering economic development
form an unbroken
lineage from Van
Hise's “Wisconsin
idea” of the early 1900s to
Kerr’s “multiuniversity”
of the 1960s [22] to Lynton and Elman’s recent call for basic changes in
existing academic
reward systems with a view
towards placing as much value on interpretation
and dissemination
of new ideas as on original
research 1281.
However, there is an analytically
soporific quality to employing
such an historical recitation
to
legitimize increased university participation
in the
commercialization
of faculty research: it proposes
institutional
changes of degree rather than kind; it
suggests historic inexorability
rather than identifying or assessing alternative possibilities
in the face
of proposals for new responsibilities;
and it masks
the mixed record of success that universities
have
had as they have assumed new social imperatives
to conduct and transfer “relevant”
research 1141.
Moreover, and most importantly,
it obscures those
expansions
in the range of services offered by
universities,
public and private, which have been
provided mainly through developing and augmenting nonfaculty
units, be these Department
of Defense-funded
research laboratories
or industrial
extension
programs,
and those which have affected or are likely to affect faculty allocation
of
time.
Universities
are no longer seeking, as they were
just a few years ago, to maintain
a distance between what may be termed “core” and “peripheral” activities in the search to commercialize
faculty research [3]. Proposals
for universities
to

become
aggressively
involved
in technological
commercialization
constitute
change in that they
affect the universities’
“ core” activities and norms,
by directly
affecting
faculty
research
agendas.
These changes entail far more than movements
in
the scale of operations
(e.g. increases in industrial
support of R&D or subscribers
to affiliates programs) or the existence of specific programs (e.g.
~‘interdisciplina~”
energy policy centers funded
by the Department
of Energy), which constitute
“normal”
institutional
perturbations
(or fads).
Institutional
change implies changes of a magnitude and duration
that, over time, affect the
qualities of individuals
who seek a university
affiliation (rather than an affiliation with an alternative institution),
and affect personal assessments
of the relative importance
of intrinsic satisfaction
on extrinsic rewards (331. Institutional
change entails socializing
an organization’s
members to a
new set of precepts,
in part through a formal
recasting of modes of compensation
(salary) and
status, but also through
tacit but nevertheless
widely understood
(and shared) conclusions
about
those types of behaviors
considered
either appropriate or beyond the pale.
An abundance
of (overlapping)
theories of institutional
change account
for recent university
actions to become directly involved in technological commercialization
of academic research. Most
embody variations
on the following themes: increased awareness of the United States’ international competition;
changes in intellectual
property rights; and increased financial
opportunities
which contribute
to state economic development
programs. Common to these themes is the degree
of external pressures on universities:
“The fate of
academic science is in the hands of institutions
outside the university,
especially government”
[50,
p. 3531 captures this mood. But external pressure
is not a demonstrable
reason for a university’s
pursuit
of commercialization,
nor for the dynamics now underway
at Harvard
or at those
other, earlier universities.
There is no evidence
that those R&D-intensive
firms that are the most
direct users of academic research as well as the
major sources of increased industrial
support for
the academic R&D that will maintain
the ‘“downstream” integration
by universities
of research and
prototype development,
have displayed little interest in this trend. To the contrary,
industry
has
frequently
stated its belief that universities
are

<-----Page 10----->I. Feller / Universities as engines of R & D-based economic growth

being diverted from producing the type of knowledge valued by industry when they (universities)
seek to directly develop specific products [lo, pp.
90-911.
Scholars in the field of higher education
have
tended to explain recent university involvement
in
commercially
oriented activities in terms of interorganizational
relationships.
Dooris, for example,
has argued that current trends reflect both “resource dependence”
and “institutional
isomorphism”. Universities
are adapting to fiscal stresses
due to decreasing revenue streams caused by declining enrollments
and fewer federal grants, by
looking for “greater resources from business and
industry-and
have increasingly
adopted the values of that community
as well” [ll]. 5
To economists
such as Davis and North,
Harvard’s action is a straightforward
validation of
economic
theories
of institutional
change:
“ . . . economic institutions
are innovated
or property rights are revised because it appears desirable
for individuals
or groups to undertake the costs of
such changes; they hope to capture some profit
which is unattainable
under the old arrangement.
An institutional
arrangement
will be innovated
if
the expected gains exceed the expected costs” [8,
p. 101.
It seems evident that a process of this type is at
work.
Institutional
changes
directed
towards
acceptance of an expanded university
role in the
commercialization
of faculty research, as represented by Harvard’s actions, appear to have been
precipitated
along the convergent
lines already
sketched by economists-a
significant
scientific

5 A contrary

view of this resource-dependence
perspective is
suggested by Dill, who notes that if a university’s motivation
for entering
into R&D arrangements
is scarce financial
resources,
an industry’s
motivation
is scarce technical
knowledge, moderated by a desire to limit risky investments.
Industry is therefore likely to seek out research contracts
with selected universities
and scientists of acknowledged
excellence, particularly
since these contracts permit them to
purchase these ideas at direct cost rather than the full-cost
recovery necessary
in their own R&D groups. Similarly,
joint research ventures in marginal capital expenditures
are
likely to be appealing
since they permit technical exploration without long-term
financial commitment.
In sum, the
resource-dependence
perspective
suggests that universities
and industry have quite different motivations
for seeking
out U/IRC,
and that the shared desire to identify interdependent
structures
or forms which successfully
promote
innovation
may be limited [9, p. 61.

345

role for academic researchers coupled with a venture capital market. Harvard’s actions can be explained as an endeavor to retain as medical school
faculty those researchers
who may receive offers
to enter private-sector
employment.
Not unexpectedly,
Harvard’s
proposal
is in the field of
medical
research,
the patent
class in which
academic research is relatively most prominent.
In
this respect, a university’s participation
in limited
partnerships
is simply another means by which
universities
compete among themselves and with
alternative
employers for scarce resources: faculty
engaged in state-of-the-art
research [21, 501. ’
It is the intra- and inter-organizational
diffusion of these institutional
changes that is important.
Changes
in institutional
policies, contractual arrangements,
or internal
norms cannot
be limited to single colleges, departments,
or disciplines. Universities
may seek to act as “rational
economic actors”, making decisions at the margin,
and indeed may be said to be doing so. Their
decisions,
however,
affect core “institutional”
standards
and practices,
not infinitely
divisible
resource flows. ’ The university
dilutes its moral
basis for limiting the involvement
of these other
faculties in like ventures once it participates
in
limited partnerships
and like arrangements
itself.
Considerations
of horizontal
equity that provide
all academic units with an equal opportunity
to
pursue commercial
prospects even if these activities affect the selection of research questions
or
strain economic credulity; the asymmetrical
fuzziness of revenue and cost projections
which highlight “expected”
gains, while leaving institutional
costs obscured;
the slow and at times difficult to
discern pace at which the scientific quality of a
faculty’s research begins to slip; and the develop.

Similar sentiments can be found at other institutions.
“Consortia are throwing us into research that is ‘relevant’ and
basic as opposed
to basic ‘exploratory.’
It means that a
whole new group of potential faculty, that otherwise would
have gone to industry, will stay on campus. Ten years ago
they would have moved on” (Richard
Cyert, President,
Carnegie-Mellon
University, as quoted in [lo, p. 461).
Ruttan,
for example, has couched his theory of induced
institutional
innovation,
the means by which the research
agendas of individual
scientists are altered, on the single
requirement
that “there be an effective incentive mechanism
to reward the scientists or administrators,
by material benefits or prestige, for their contributions
to the solution of
problems that are of social or economic significance”
[52. p.
331.

~rni~~rsities as engines of R&D-based

ment of an administrative
cadre committed
to
expanding
a university’s commercialization
activities, leave a university
vulnerable
to expanded,
direct participation
in such ventures. And, unlike
the case of private-sector
firms who, in Nelkin and
Nelson’s view, may make mistakes but have bottom-line profit strictures to “keep them from continuing to invest in activities that are not good for
them” f39, p. 335 it is not readily apparent
that
universities
will either recognize these situations
when they confront them or be able to pull back
on the extended commitments
they have made.
The efficiency snare of nonmarket
organizations;
the lack of market signals; the tendency to use too
many resources relative to output or to seek to
produce too much relative to foregone alternatives, may be latent in explaining
the surge of
universities
into commercial
arrangements
1441.
Over time this lack may reveal itself in the slow
rate at which institutions
extricate themselves from
financially
unprofitable
situations.
Institutional
change among universities,
however, is more than a process through which each
single university computes its expected gains and
costs. It also is a process of imitation
and bandwagon effects as well (191, or of what academic
sociologists
are increasingly
referring
to as
“mimetic
isomorphism”
[26]. It is in this respect
that Harvard’s
actions
are important,
whereas
comparable
and earlier initiatives
by the University of Utah, which has described its activities as
“academic
capitalism”
[2, p. 121, were not.
Harvard’s policy reversal, given its standing as a
premiere research institution,
and the articulateness with which its president had previously sought
to set university
participation
in commercial
undertakings,
serves to increase the pressure on like
institutions
to establish
comparable
policies in
order to retain otherwise mobile faculties. Moreover, the reputational
penumbra cast by Harvard’s
actions makes it more difficult for other universities to resist proposals
to participate
in equity
ventures on the basis of their impacts upon the
university’s missions or its vague economic underpinnings.

4. Conclusion
Participation
in ventures that will commercialize faculty research may be explained as necessary

e~#n~~~e growth

adjustments
to retain resources
(faculty)
being
lured by competing
bidders
and by optimistic
projections
generated
by examples of “winners”,
either home-grown
or from comparable
institutions. However, policies influenced
in the short
run by efforts towards the best and the brightest,
or most patentable
and profitable
of universitybased research endeavors
affect the larger set of
signals,
incentives,
and norms
for other
researchers,
and thus in the long run, affect all
forms of academic knowledge.
There is little reason to expect, based on past
performance,
that any sizeable reallocation
of faculty efforts towards commercially
oriented R&D
will generate
appreciable
new net revenues
for
other than a select number of universities.
Seeking
to gamer sizeable net revenue streams from increased patent
and technology
licensing
is for
most institutions
the equivalent
of purchasing
lottery tickets whose expected value is likely to be
less than the purchase price.
Increased
patent/ technology
licensing
operations may simply be a money-losing
proposition,
as royalty and licensing incomes fall short of the
“full” costs of operating these programs. Factored
into these revenue calculations
also must be the
likely substitution
of revenue streams as current
industrial
sponsors draw back from funding research whose findings may be channelled
to competing enterprises.
Increased
efforts by universities
to foster the
commercialization
of technological
innovations
erode the singular position
occupied by institutions of higher learning in the United States. Universities have accumulated
intellectual
and political capital not only because of their scientific and
technical expertise, but because of their symbolic
and putative role as an engaged but monetarily
disinterested
participant
in social discourse. Universities, by mission and popular acceptance,
are
societal institutions
whose individual
members are
available to serve as “neutral”
sources of expertise.
A disinterested,
nonpecu~a~
orientation
serves
as the foundation
for the faculty members’ ability
to venture forth from the ivory tower to contribute
in a wide variety of expert, policy, advisory, or
litigious settings. As Bok has noted, “The introduction
of a different
set of motives oriented
towards private gain threatens to reduce the credibility of the scientists involved and to diminish the

<-----Page 12----->I. Feller / Universities as engines of R & D-based economic growth

capacity either to elicit complete trust from their
colleagues or to secure the unmixed admiration
of
the public” [7, p. 1511.
“Thinking
one can” may be a sign of creative
and financially astute entrepreneurship
on the part
of universities. But whether profitable or not, these
ventures serve to shift academic researchers from
the social roles in which they are most efficient, as
suppliers of a collective good-scientific
and technological knowledge.
