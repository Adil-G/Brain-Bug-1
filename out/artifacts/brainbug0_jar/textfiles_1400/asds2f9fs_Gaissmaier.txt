Probability matching is a classic choice anomaly that has been studied extensively. While
many approaches assume that it is a cognitive shortcut driven by cognitive limitations,
recent literature suggests that it is not a strategy per se, but rather another outcome of people’s well-documented misperception of randomness. People search for patterns even in
random sequences, which results in probability matching at the outcome level. Previous
studies have supported this by the ﬁnding that distracting people with a secondary verbal
working memory task presumably prevents the pattern search, resulting in more maximizing behavior that is considered more rational. The current paper demonstrates with two
experiments that there is actually truth in both accounts. For some participants, probability
matching indeed seems to be the result of a cognitive shortcut, a simple ‘‘win-stay, loseshift” strategy, and in one experiment identiﬁed these as participants low in working memory capacity. For others, however, a potentially smart pattern search strategy underlies
probability matching. These probability matchers (who still look irrational in the absence
of patterns) actually have a higher chance of ﬁnding a pattern if one exists. Contrary to the
almost uniformly negative perception of probability matching, we therefore conclude that
there can be a potentially smart strategy behind probability matching.

1. Introduction
‘‘Clarice, does this random scattering of sites seem overdone to you? Doesn’t it seem desperately random? Random
past all possible convenience? Does it suggest to you the
elaborations of a bad liar?” (Harris, 1988/1991, p. 293).
In Thomas Harris’s ‘‘The Silence of the Lambs”, the psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned murderous
cannibal, helps FBI agent Clarice Starling ﬁnd a serial killer.
His comment on a map of the sites where the victims were
found is crucial: The serial killer tries to hide his location
among seemingly random sites, but by being too random
to be credibly random, he unintentionally helps agent Starling discover an important pattern that leads to him.
This example illustrates both that people are not overly
successful in producing randomness and that they are very

good in detecting patterns. Both may be two sides of the
same coin – the well-documented misperception of randomness (e.g., Bar-Hillel & Wagenaar, 1991) may facilitate
the early detection of patterns (Lopes, 1982). Sometimes,
however, people even detect patterns where there are
none, and it is easier to convince them that a sequence is
structured than that it is random (Hyman & Jenkin, 1956).
Probability matching, a classic choice anomaly, could be
a further consequence of misperceiving randomness. In a
typical experiment, people have to predict which of two
events that have different probabilities of occurring will
take place. For example, event E1 could occur with a probability of p(E1) = .67, while event E2 occurs with
p(E2) = 1  p(E1) = .33. Given that the sequence of events
is random, the best strategy would be always to predict
the more frequent event E1. This strategy is called maximizing and would yield an average accuracy of 67%. However, most often probability matching is observed, that is,
predicting the events in proportion to their probability of

occurrence. In the example this would mean predicting E1
in 67% of the trials and E2 in 33% of the trials. Probability
matching is considered suboptimal, because it would yield
an accuracy of only 55.78% on average (:67  :67þ
:33  :33). There are numerous attempts to explain this
choice anomaly (see Vulkan (2000), for a review). A commonality behind many of these approaches is that they
tie probability matching to cognitive limitations, based
on the idea that ‘‘the default processing strategy of most
participants is a nonnormative cognitive shortcut” (West
& Stanovich, 2003, p. 249).
Yet there is also a quite different view on probability
matching, which we would like to elaborate on here: Probability matching occurs because people do not see or believe the randomness of the sequence and try to outdo
the optimal maximizing strategy (and inevitably fail). For
instance, people maximize more strongly if they believe
in the randomness of the sequence. Goodnow (1955)
showed that people were more likely to maximize if the
task was framed as gambling rather than problem-solving.
Wolford, Newman, Miller, and Wig (2004) manipulated the
perceived randomness of a sequence of events more directly by increasing the alternation rate of the binary
event. If events alternate (slightly) more often than would
be expected by chance, then the sequence is actually less
random, but people perceive it to be more random (cf. Ayton & Fischer, 2004; Falk & Konold, 1997; Gilovich, Vallone,
& Tversky, 1985). Wolford et al. found that people maximized more strongly if the alternation rate was higher than
chance than when it was actually random.
In line with Wolford et al. (2004), we believe that probability matching is not a strategy per se, but rather the outcome of a more complex, cognitively more demanding
strategy—the search for patterns. Wolford, Miller, and Gazzaniga (2000) pointed out that any plausible pattern a person might try has to match the probabilities. As long as
people do not believe that the sequence is random, they
will try to improve their predictive accuracy by looking
for regularities in the sequence. In the last block of a binary
choice experiment conducted by Yellott (1969), participants always received feedback indicating that their predictions were correct, irrespective of what they predicted.
They continued to match probabilities, and when asked
for their impressions afterwards, most responded that they
ﬁnally found the pattern in the sequence. Congruently, Unturbe and Corominas (2007) showed that participants who
reported having found complex rules in a random sequence of binary events were closer to probability matching than those who did not report such rules.
The pattern search idea is further supported by Wolford
et al.’s (2004) ﬁnding that distracting people with a secondary verbal working memory task presumably prevents
the pattern search, resulting in more maximizing behavior
(and thus in behavior that is considered more rational).
Similarly, Kareev, Lieberman, and Lev (1997) showed that
people with low short-term memory capacity maximized
more consistently than did people with a higher shortterm memory capacity in a very similar task. Gaissmaier,
Schooler, and Rieskamp (2006; cf. Gaissmaier, Mata, &
Schooler, 2008) replicated this result and interpreted it
along the lines of Wolford et al. by hypothesizing that peo-

ple with low short-term memory capacity lack the cognitive capacity needed to search much for patterns.
Moreover, Gaissmaier et al.’s modeling efforts suggest that
people with higher short-term memory capacity tended to
explore more. Although this explorative behavior put them
at a disadvantage as long as the environment was stable, it
actually helped them track changes in the environment.
In this paper we report 2 experiments that further investigate what underlies probability matching and test two
competing hypotheses. If (i) probability matching indeed
reﬂects the tendency to search for patterns, then people
who probability match in the typical binary choice task
should be more likely to ﬁnd patterns if they exist. Indeed,
those people who have been traditionally interpreted as
being irrational (because they probability match in the absence of patterns) would actually look smart when patterns
are present. Alternatively, if (ii) probability matching results from a lazy cognitive shortcut, as proposed by West
and Stanovich (2003), then it should not be related to ﬁnding patterns. We studied a well-deﬁned shortcut that leads
to probability matching, ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”. This strategy consists of repeating predictions if they were successful
in the last trial, but changing them if they failed.
Moreover, we investigated how strategy use is related
to working memory capacity, which itself to some degree
reﬂects differences in strategic processing of information
(Cokely, Kelley, & Gilchrist, 2006). While pattern search
should go along with higher working memory capacity
(e.g., DeCaro, Thomas, & Beilock, 2008), relying on a cognitive shortcut should go along with lower working memory
capacity, such as West and Stanovich (2003) propose.

2. Experiment 1
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Participants
Eighty people (44 female), mostly students, with an
average age of 24 years (SD = 4.06) participated in the
study.
2.1.2. Design and procedure
The main task was to predict repeatedly whether a red
square would appear in the upper half of the screen or a
green square in the lower half, similar to Wolford et al.
(2004). After 10 training trials, there were 576 trials altogether, divided into halves of 288 trials. Participants earned
€ .01 for each correct trial in addition to a € 5 show-up fee.
Every participant saw both a no-pattern and a pattern half,
the order of which was counterbalanced.
The no-pattern half consisted of 288 trials of the binary
choice task without any pattern. That is, the sequence of
events was serially independent. The probability of the
more common event was p = .67, while the probability of
the less common event was 1  p = .33.
The pattern half consisted of a pattern of length 12, in
the sequence 001010001100. The probability of the more
common event was thus also p = .67 (i.e., 8/12), while the
probability of the less common event was p = .33 (i.e., 4/
12). The pattern was repeated for 288 trials.

Between the halves, there was a short break and participants were reminded that the second half could potentially be different. To make it easier to detect that
something was indeed different, the more common event
was reversed between the two halves.1
An automated operation span task (Unsworth, Heitz,
Schrock, & Engle, 2005; cf. Conway et al., 2005) was administered before the main task to assess working memory
capacity.
2.2. Results and discussion
For all participants, we counted how often they predicted the more frequent event in the no-pattern half.
We will subsequently call this variable maximizing, as
it reﬂects the degree to which someone is applying a
maximizing strategy. A value of 1 would reﬂect perfect
maximization (i.e., always predicting the more frequent
event), a value of .67 would reﬂect probability matching,
and a value of .5 would reﬂect a guessing strategy.
2.2.1. Median split analyses
For each participant, we computed how close this participant’s behavior was to probability matching by calculating the absolute difference between their degree of
maximizing and probability matching (i.e., .67) in the nopattern half. We divided participants into probability
matchers and non-matchers at their median proximity to
probability matching. This median split was done separately for each of the counterbalancing conditions, so that
there were 20 probability matchers and 20 non-matchers
each.
Based on this classiﬁcation in the no-pattern half, we
predicted that probability matchers would be more successful in picking up the pattern than non-matchers in
the pattern half. To investigate this, we looked at the proportion of trials where they made correct predictions in the
pattern half (pattern accuracy subsequently). The pattern
accuracy of probability matchers and non-matchers was
similar early in the pattern half. But over time, probability
matchers improved their accuracy more than non-matchers, suggesting that they were better able to pick up the
pattern (Fig. 1A). In a repeated measures analysis of variance, we included the within-subject factor block (consisting of the accuracy in three pattern blocks of 96 trials each)
and two between-subjects factors, probability matcher vs.
non-matcher and order of presentation. The growing separation between probability matchers and non-matchers
was reﬂected in the linear contrast between the factors
probability matcher vs. non-matcher and block,
F(1, 76) = 7.86, p = .006, g2p ¼ :09. None of the interactions
including the factor order of presentation was substantial,
nor was its between-subjects effect.
2.2.2. Curvilinearity analyses
Median splits as used here can decrease statistical
power and introduce error (Irwin & McClelland, 2003). Fur1
Which event was more common in which half was additionally
counterbalanced, but will be disregarded subsequently since it did not
affect the main dependent variables.

thermore, by using the absolute distance to probability
matching, we have treated deviations from probability
matching in both directions (i.e., toward chance performance and toward maximizing) identically. That is, we
have looked at a linear relation between proximity to probability matching in the no-pattern half and the ability to
pick up patterns in the pattern half.
However, if one does not use proximity to probability
matching but the proportion of maximizing responses in
the no-pattern half as independent variable, then one
would predict a curvilinear relation to the ability to pick
up patterns. Namely, pattern ﬁnding should peak at probability matching level and drop both toward chance performance and toward maximizing.
Such a curvilinear trend was reﬂected in a quadratic
regression with the proportion of maximizing responses
in the no-pattern half as independent variable and accuracy in the last pattern block as dependent variable,
F(2, 77) = 2.63, p = .08, R2 = .06. The linear regression only
accounted for less than 1% of the variance, F(1, 78) = 0.06,
p = .80, R2 = .001. The linear contrast effect in the median
split analysis suggests that the improvement in pattern
accuracy differs between probability matchers and nonmatchers, as probability matchers started with about the
same accuracy as non-matchers, but ended up higher. Similarly, the explained variance in the quadratic regression is
greater if instead of accuracy on the last pattern block the
improvement between the ﬁrst and the last pattern block
is predicted, F(2, 77) = 7.64, p = .001, R2 = .17 (Fig. 2A).
Again, the linear regression only accounted for 1% of the
variance, F(1, 78) = 0.84, p = .36, R2 = .01.2
2.2.3. Win-stay, lose-shift
As pointed out in the introduction, probability matching
can also result from a cognitive shortcut, namely a simple
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” strategy. This strategy predicts that
participants repeat predictions after successful trials, but
change them after failures.
For each participant, we calculated the proportion of trials in the no-pattern half that could be described by ‘‘winstay, lose-shift”. Participants using that strategy would also
end up probability matching, but we would not assume
that they are looking for patterns. Congruently, ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift” negatively correlated with pattern accuracy in
the last pattern block, r(38) = .37, p = .02, and improvement across pattern blocks, r(38) = .40, p = .01 among
probability matchers (as deﬁned by the median split).
We then dichotomously classiﬁed participants as using
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” or not. We did this by comparing the
ﬁt of ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” to the participants’ responses to

2
In addition to the curvilinearity analyses on decision outcomes, we also
ran similar analyses to predict response times. In Experiment 1, there was a
curvilinear relation between maximizing and response times, indicating
that probability matchers were both slower than maximizers and than
guessers, supporting the idea that they were applying a more complex
strategy. The results from Experiment 2, however, were inconsistent with
these results. First of all, the relation between maximizing and response
times was linear rather than curvilinear – the higher the degree of
maximizing, the faster. More importantly even, working memory capacity
explained more variance in speed, with higher working memory going
along with faster response times, which was not the case in Experiment 1.

including probability matching (i.e., .67) and have widened it by adding and subtracting .05 (i.e., it goes from .62 to .72). Since there are only few people
below .62, all of them are included in one bin. The number of participants in the bins is 10, 34, 22, and 14, respectively, from left to right, in Experiment 1,
and 29, 42, 54, and 14, respectively, in Experiment 2.

the ﬁt that would be expected, given that someone did not
use ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”, but simply responded according
to her base rates of predicting one option over the other.3
Among probability matchers, 40.0% were classiﬁed as using
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”, compared to 27.5% of non-matchers.
3
The expected ﬁt of ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” depends on the base rates of
predicting one event over the other. Here, it is :67  p þ :33  ð1  pÞ on
average, where p is the proportion of trials that a participant predicts the
more frequent event. We simulated 10,000 runs for each participant. For
each run, we used the stimuli the participant saw, and calculated the
proportion of trials that would be ﬁt by ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”, given that
participants made predictions according to their base rate, p. Participants
were classiﬁed as using ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” if the ﬁt of this strategy to
their actual predictions was higher than the best ﬁt in the 10,000 runs of
the simulation.

Those probability matchers who used ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”
only achieved a ﬁnal pattern accuracy of 81.3%, compared
to 89.5% of those who did not use ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”,
t(21.9) = 1.75, p = .09, d = 0.59.
2.2.4. Working memory capacity
The use of more complex strategies such as pattern
search should be related to working memory. Congruently,
working memory capacity was related to pattern accuracy
on the last pattern block, r(78) = .22, p = .05. However, it
did not predict proximity to probability matching,
r(78) = .02, p = .89.
We showed that probability matching is the result of
pattern search for some, but the result of ‘‘win-stay, loseshift” for others. Supporting the idea that ‘‘win-stay,

lose-shift” is a cognitive shortcut, this strategy describes
probability matchers with a lower working memory capacity better, r(38) = .36, p = 0.02.

3. Experiment 2
Experiment 1 only employed one particular pattern. To
test whether the results would generalize to other patterns, we replicated the experiment but instead each participant received a randomly generated pattern. We
expected, however, that random patterns could introduce
another source of variability that could wash out the systematic relation between the strategy a person employs
and their ability to ﬁnd patterns. Whether or not people
ﬁnd a pattern is not only a function of their strategy but
also of the difﬁculty of the pattern. For example, some patterns could be so transparent that someone wedded to
maximizing could not miss them. Others could be so difﬁcult that even a dedicated pattern searcher would not ﬁnd
them. To deal with this, we increased the number of participants. Furthermore, as we did not predict any differences
between the two counterbalancing conditions, and as we
did not ﬁnd any differences in Experiment 1, we eliminated
one of the counterbalancing conditions; all participants
now started with the no-pattern half followed by the pattern half.
3.1. Method
3.1.1. Participants
One-hundred and thirty-nine people (83 female),
mostly students, with an average age of 24 years
(SD = 3.11) participated in the study.
3.1.2. Design and procedure
Design and procedure were identical to Experiment 1
with the following exceptions. Now all participants started
with the no-pattern half followed by the pattern half. The
pattern half consisted of a pattern of length 12. This time,
the pattern was not identical for each participant, but instead each participant received a randomly generated pattern. The only restriction of the pattern was that the
probability of the more common event was again p = .67
(i.e., 8/12), while the probability of the less common event
was p = .33 (i.e., 4/12). The pattern was repeated for 288
trials.
3.2. Results and discussion
The following analyses are identical to the major analyses in Experiment 1, which are motivated and described in
detail in Experiment 1.
3.2.1. Median split analyses
Again, we divided participants into probability matchers and non-matchers at their median absolute distance
to probability matching (i.e., .67) in the no-pattern half.
Based on this classiﬁcation in the no-pattern half, we then
tried to predict how good people were in ﬁnding the randomly generated pattern in the pattern half.

5

In a repeated measures analysis of variance, we included
the within-subject factor block (consisting of the accuracy
in three pattern blocks of 96 trials each) and probability
matcher vs. non-matcher as between-subjects factor. This
time, there was no growing separation between probability
matchers and non-matchers, as there was basically no linear contrast effect between the factors probability matcher
vs. non-matcher and block, F(1, 137) = 2.47, p = .119,
g2p ¼ :02. Instead, probability matchers were better than
non-matchers overall, reﬂected in a between-subjects effect for the factor probability matcher vs. non-matcher,
F(1, 137) = 7.08, p = .009, g2p ¼ :05 (Fig. 1B). Individual ttests revealed that this difference held on all three blocks,
all ts > 2.10, all ps < .04, Cohen’s d ranging from 0.36 to 0.49.
3.2.2. Curvilinearity analyses
In Experiment 1, pattern accuracy was highest for people closest to probability matching and dropped for people
whose predictive behavior in the no-pattern half was closer to guessing or to maximizing. This shows up again: A
curvilinear trend was reﬂected in a quadratic regression
with the proportion of maximizing responses in the nopattern half as independent variable and accuracy in the
last pattern block as dependent variable, F(2, 136) = 3.23,
p = .04, R2 = .05. The linear regression only accounted for
less than 1% of the variance, F(1, 137) = 1.21, p = .27,
R2 = .009. That there was no linear contrast effect in the
median split analysis in Experiment 2, contrary to Experiment 1, suggests that it is not so much the improvement
in pattern accuracy that differs between probability
matchers and non-matchers this time. Congruently,
although there was a curvilinear trend reﬂected in a quadratic regression when predicting the improvement between the ﬁrst and the last pattern block (such as in
Experiment 1), it was not stronger than predicting ﬁnal
pattern accuracy, F(2, 136) = 3.86, p = .02, R2 = .05
(Fig. 2B). Again, the linear regression was not substantial,
F(1, 137) = 0.22, p = .64, R2 = .002.
3.2.3. Win-stay, lose-shift
In Experiment 1, we found that if participants are probability matching because they are relying on a ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift” strategy, this made it less likely that they found
the pattern. As in Experiment 1, the accordance of a participant’s behavior with ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” among probability matchers (as deﬁned by the median split)
negatively correlated with pattern accuracy in the last pattern block, r(73) = .28, p = .01, but not with improvement
across pattern blocks this time, r(73) = .14, p = .22.
Again, we dichotomously classiﬁed participants as
using ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” or not, such as in Experiment
1. Among probability matchers, 50.7% were classiﬁed as
using ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”, compared to 51.6% of nonmatchers. Those probability matchers who used ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift” only achieved a ﬁnal pattern accuracy of 85.3%,
compared to 94.0% of those who did not use ‘‘win-stay,
lose-shift”, t(61.6) = 2.81, p = .007, d = 0.65.
3.2.4. Working memory capacity
In Experiment 1, working memory capacity positively
correlated with pattern accuracy and negatively correlated

with accordance to ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift”. This time, working memory capacity was not related to pattern accuracy
on the last pattern block, r(137) = .09, p = .28, but was
weakly correlated
to overall pattern
accuracy,
r(137) = .15, p = .09. As in Experiment 1, it was not related
to proximity to probability matching per se, r(137) = .06,
p = .52. This time, working memory capacity was not related to ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” among probability matchers,
r(73) = .08, p = 0.49.
4. General discussion
We showed differences between participants in their
tendencies to search for patterns. Predictive behavior more
closely in line with probability matching in the absence of
a pattern was related to pattern accuracy when a pattern
was introduced in both experiments. At least for some people, probability matching thus results from relentless
search for patterns. For them, probability matching is actually not a strategy per se, but rather the outcome of a more
complex search for patterns.
However, there were also probability matchers who did
not pick up regularities. We identiﬁed some of these people if their probability matching could be better described
by a ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” strategy. At least in Experiment
1, ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” went along with lower working
memory capacity. Although this relation to working memory capacity did not replicate in Experiment 2, we believe
it is justiﬁed to say ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” can be seen a cognitive shortcut. It is simple but at the cost of hindering pattern detection in this setting. Still, this does not mean that
‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” is generally a bad strategy, and it is
known to be very successful in competitive situations such
as the prisoner’s dilemma game (Nowak & Sigmund, 1993).
Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of looking beyond the outcome of decisions and to
the underlying strategies. Here, the same outcome, probability matching, is reached by some participants by a simple ‘‘win-stay, lose-shift” strategy. For others, however,
rather the opposite seems to be true. They can be described
as probability matching, because they are looking for patterns rather than relying on cognitive shortcuts.
Lopes (1982) discussed the predisposition towards pattern detection in a signal detection framework, arguing
that it can be seen as a liberal criterion to classify something as signal (i.e., generated by a nonrandom process) instead of noise (i.e., generated by a random process).
Thereby, people limit the number of misses but increase
the number of false alarms (cf. Kareev, 1995, for a similar
argument regarding the detection of correlation). To conclusively evaluate the predisposition towards pattern
detection, one needs to consider the structure of the real
environment (Todd & Gigerenzer, 2007).
And regarding the natural environment, Pinker (1997, p.
346) speculated that patterns are ubiquitous: ‘‘Many
events work like that. They have a characteristic life history, a changing probability of occurring over time.” Ayton
and Fischer (2004), cf. Ayton, Hunt, & Wright, 1989) have
pointed out that there are not many natural environments
where one can safely assume conditional independence of

a succession of events, except for casinos and psychology
laboratories. However, one can easily come up with examples where incorrectly assuming patterns although there
are none can cause great harm. For example, people look
for trends and patterns in investment decisions and often
pay too much attention to recent outcomes (Rieskamp,
2006). Additionally, one could argue that in the current
experimental setting, participants could have employed a
maximizing strategy and at the same time looked for patterns, as feedback was independent of choice. The results
indicate that this is not what people were doing, and this
is in line with typically observed differences between acting and observing, which have been reported for maximizing in binary choice (Newell & Rakow, 2007) and for
recency effects (Rakow, Demes, & Newell, 2008). And
although maximizing and looking for patterns at the same
time would be possible in this setting, in many other environments it would not be, because often feedback will depend on choice.
Therefore, we refrain from ﬁnally evaluating the misperception of randomness and the resulting epiphenomenon probability matching as rational or irrational. Still,
the results reported here illustrate the importance of considering the structure of the environment when evaluating
behavior. What works poorly in one environment (here:
searching for patterns if there are none and ending up with
suboptimal probability matching) may work well in another (here: actually ﬁnding patterns if they do exist). Contrary to the almost uniformly negative perception of
probability matching, we therefore conclude that there
can be a potentially smart strategy behind probability
matching.
