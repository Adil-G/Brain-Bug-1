Entrepreneurship courses are vital components of a business school curriculum. Although
existing studies examine teaching pedagogy, very few explore the content of
entrepreneurship courses. We compare start-up activities of nascent entrepreneurs in the
Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) dataset to data collected from a sample
of entrepreneurship textbooks. Our findings indicate that while there is some overlap in
start-up activities practiced by nascent entrepreneurs and those covered in textbooks,
there are several differences as well. Implications for teaching are discussed.

2005). Approximately 2,200 courses are offered at
1,600 colleges and universities nationwide, more
than 200 colleges and universities have majors and
concentrations in entrepreneurship, and at least 20
business schools require that all graduates of their
institutions take entrepreneurship classes as part
of the curriculum (Katz, 2003). Virtually all schools
with an AACSB-accredited MBA or 4-year degree
and nearly all nationally ranked schools are teaching entrepreneurship (Katz, 2003).
Entrepreneurship course material is intended to
encourage and stimulate the creation of new ventures (Vesper & Gartner, 1997; Leitch & Harrison,
1999; Peterman & Kennedy, 2003). However, there is
little evidence to indicate whether we are actually
teaching the skills most important to future entrepreneurs. In other words, if we believe that entrepreneurship education is important, are we teaching our students the necessary activities that
enhance the probability of start-up?
Our question is grounded in the notion of relevance. Relevance is used in many academic disciplines including cognitive science, logic, artificial
intelligence, communication, and in cognitive psy-

The launch of a new organization is generally
agreed to be the core of entrepreneurship (Gartner,
1985; Low & Abramson, 1997; Katz & Gartner, 1988;
Aldrich, 1999; Delmar & Shane, 2004). Encouragement and facilitation of start-up new ventures is a
major public policy concern because of their impact on economic growth, particularly job creation
(Reynolds, Camp, Bygrave, Autio, & Hay, 2001). The
evidence of new firms’ economic contributions,
coupled with increased interest in entrepreneurship by students and an emphasis on entrepreneurship by the Association to Advance Collegiate
Schools of Business (AACSB), has spurred colleges
and universities to expand curricula in this area
(Porter & McKibben, 1988; Bechard & Gregoire,

chology (Sperber & Wilson, 1996). The principle of
relevance is based on the fact that we “intend in
general to give or add information about what is a
matter of standing or current interest or concern”
(Wilson, 1999: 719). At the individual level, relevance is a property of inputs to cognitive processes
that is analyzed in terms of cognitive and processing effort. The greater the cognitive effects, the
greater the relevance of the input. Human attention and processing resources are allocated to information that seems relevant (Sperber & Wilson,
1996). Relevance is contextually based and is
shaped by our experience and background (Wilson
& Sperber, 2003). Relevance of inputs by a communicator is a precursor to acceptance of social realities, or information about a topic that shapes perceptions about its value, ultimately leading to
perceptions of legitimacy (Suchman, 1995).
At a broader level, relevance is important to entrepreneurship pedagogy because it influences the
perceived legitimacy of courses and programs
among stakeholders, including students, administrators, and parents. Legitimacy, or the strength of
institutional endorsement and social acceptance,
represents the belief that organizational policies
or exchanges, in this case entrepreneurship education, are designed in a desirable manner within
the socially constructed system of appropriate
norms and values (Suchman, 1995). Educational institutions create and spread knowledge about the
competencies that are needed to be entrepreneurial (Aldrich, 1999). The more course content corresponds to the reality of behaviors leading to the
probability of start-up, the more likely that entrepreneurship courses will be perceived as relevant
and thereby more legitimate by students and other
stakeholders.
Currently, there is growing interest in the nature,
content, and relevance of entrepreneurship education (Leitch & Harrison, 1999). A recent Academy of
Management Learning & Education special issue
argues that entrepreneurship education needs to
reflect the real-world environment (Greene, Katz, &
Johannison, 2004), even it that means challenging
traditional educational hallmarks, such as a focus
on the business plan (Honig, 2004). Previous work
on entrepreneurship education echoes this theme.
In terms of teaching pedagogy, broad exposure to
entrepreneurial practice is advocated as a way to
narrow “the academia vs. business incongruence”
(Kuratko, 2005: 586) and to shift the emphasis from
educating “about” entrepreneurship to educating
“for” it (Kirby, 2004). Recently, experiential learning
has been highlighted as a method for engaging
students more actively in the learning process. Us-

57

ing tools such as student business start-ups, “live”
cases, or simulations, students gain exposure to
the many issues surrounding new venture start-up
(Carland & Carland, 2001). However, despite the
increased emphasis on experiential learning, most
entrepreneurship courses are structured around a
series of new venture development challenges including opportunity identification and feasibility
analysis; new venture planning, financing and operating; new market development and expansion
strategies; and institutionalizing innovation (Solomon, Duffy, & Tarabishy, 2002).
While current scholarship recognizes the shortcomings of entrepreneurship education as it is currently practiced, to date little research has adopted
a content perspective and systematically compared what we are teaching in the classroom to
what entrepreneurs are doing when they start a
new venture. That is our purpose here: We examine the relationship between teaching and practice. At a more general level we are asking the
question, “Are our current entrepreneurship educational practices relevant to what actual entrepreneurs are practicing?” We examine this broader
question by specifically exploring whether the
start-up activities that we teach correspond to
those activities that enhance the probability of
start-up. Our underlying premise is that if teaching
and practice differ significantly, then as educators,
we need to revise our pedagogy to better prepare
students for the reality of starting a new venture.

BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Entrepreneurial Start-Up Activities
There is little agreement on theoretical perspectives of entrepreneurial start-up, although the creation of an organization (organizational emergence) is agreed to be a central activity in the field
of entrepreneurship (Katz & Gartner, 1988; Aldrich,
1999; Shane & Delmar, 2004). Recent entrepreneurship research tends to coalesce on the conceptualization of organizational emergence as a process
made up of multiple start-up activities (Gartner et
al., 2004a: 285). Individuals who initiate organizing
activates intended to culminate in a viable business start-up are referred to as nascent (or emerging) entrepreneurs (Aldrich, 1999). The organizing
activities in which nascent entrepreneurs are engaged involve setting up routines and structures
that are goal directed and establishing boundaries
and systems of activities (Aldrich, 1999).
Perspectives on organizing activities that influ-

<-----Page 2----->58

Academy of Management Learning & Education

ence the probability of start-up have a variety of
theoretical roots (Shane & Delmar, 2004). Early
work described the process as a change model,
whereby entrepreneurs accumulate external resources and technology necessary to transform
their ideas into a reality by creating a new business unit (Van de Ven, Angle, & Poole, 1989). More
recent theoretical perspectives include institutional theory that argues new ventures can survive by achieving legitimacy through the organizing process (Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002); the
resource-based view which posits that development of unique resources can lead to opportunity
exploitation (Choi & Shepherd, 2004); and evolutionary theory that argues external stakeholder
relationships help ventures to overcome their liability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965; Aldrich,
1999).
Concurrent with emergence of theories explaining new venture start-ups, researchers conducted
studies examining start-up processes. Reynolds
and Miller (1992) examined a sample of nascent
entrepreneurs and found that start-up activities
did not have a logical progression. Following this
research, Gatewood, Shaver, and Gartner, (1995)
explored whether cognitive factors as well as entrepreneurial activities led to the formation of a
business. They found that activities involving setting up business operations, such as purchasing
raw materials and supplies, hiring and training
employees, producing, distributing, and marketing
a product or service were significantly correlated
with the creation of a new firm. Carter, Gartner,
and Reynolds, (1996) identified a random sample of
adults who were in the process of starting a venture. They examined specific start-up activities,
such as personal commitment, financial support,
hiring, and activities which developed the structure of the business. They found that the number of
activities undertaken, and focusing on activities
which made the business more tangible to others
(e.g., looking for facilities and equipment, forming
a legal entity) versus less tangible activities (e.g.,
acquiring a D&B credit listing) increased the likelihood of survival.
While these early studies showed that the activities of nascent entrepreneurs who started a business were different from those of nascent entrepreneurs who did not, they suffered from problems of
retrospective bias, lack of generalizability, and
small sample size. These data collection issues
were part of the impetus for the creation of the
Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED)
dataset(s) (see Gartner, Shaver, Carter, & Reyn-

March

olds, 2004b), which specifically examines the
start-up activities of nascent entrepreneurs (see
Appendix A for a complete list of start-up activities
in the PSED dataset). Building off of PSED data that
were either collected in the United States or internationally, a number of more recent studies examine the connection between start-up activities and
the probability of start-up.
Shane and Delmar (2004) examined groups of
planning, legitimacy, and market activities and
their effect on the probability of starting a new
venture of 223 Swedish new ventures. They found
that planning and legitimacy were significantly
correlated with the probability of starting a new
venture but that market activities had no effect.
Two additional studies examined the timing of
business plans and found that new ventures that
wrote business plans before talking to customers
and or before beginning marketing or promotion
had a lower rate of termination than other firms
(Delmar & Shane, 2003; Shane & Delmar, 2004). An
additional study showed that those firms engaging
in legitimizing activities were less likely to disband (Delmar & Shane, 2004). Table 1 presents an
overview of the research using start-up activities
and their impact on the probability of new venture
start-up.
In summary, there are a number of studies on
various aspects of start-up activities. The focus of
these studies ranges from initial descriptive work
on identifying activities, to more sophisticated
work that links specific activities, such as legitimacy and planning to the probability of start-up.
From these studies we can conclude that the activities in which entrepreneurs engage during the
start-up process are an important area of inquiry in
the field of entrepreneurship. However, less clear
is whether the activities that lead to the probability of starting a new venture correspond to the
content of course work in entrepreneurship
classes. This led us to wonder about the relevance
of what we are teaching in the classroom, and
more specifically, if start-up activities are adequately reflected in entrepreneurship course content and delivery. From this we raise two research
questions:
Research Question 1: Are we teaching the same
start-up activities that nascent entrepreneurs practice?
Research Question 2: Are we teaching the start-up
activities that enhance the
probability that nascent entrepreneurs will start a new
venture?

METHODOLOGY
Sample and Sources of Data
We used two sources of data for this project: data
from entrepreneurship textbooks currently used in
the institutions of higher education in the USA and
data on nascent entrepreneur practices from the

59

Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED)
Data Set. Each data source is explained below.
Data on Entrepreneurship Textbooks
To better understand which textbooks entrepreneur instructors are using to teach new venture
launch, we first sent out a query to the Academy of
Management Entrepreneurship Division listserv
asking for information about preferred texts used
in entrepreneurship courses. We received 20 detailed responses from our colleagues, identifying
more than 26 different textbooks, with 6 being referenced more than three times. To insure the representativeness of our brief survey, we then contacted each school on a publicly available list of
100 top U.S. entrepreneurship programs (see www.
entrepreneur.com/topcolleges/html) and requested
a copy of their entrepreneurship syllabi. Over a
2-month period, we collected 58 syllabi from 35
schools (35% response rate). Upon close examination of the syllabi we found that most courses used
at least one entrepreneurship textbook as a course
anchor.
We then contacted all the major academic textbook publishers and asked them to send us copies
of their top-selling entrepreneurship textbooks. We
received 24 textbooks from 13 different textbook
publishers. We compared the list of textbooks received from publishers to the list of texts used most
widely in courses and found that there was strong
correspondence. Since our study is focused on
start-up activities, we selected textbooks that discuss new venture start-up. To identify the specific
books to use in the study, the three coauthors developed a list of content criteria and independently
applied it to each book, coming up with an overall
recommendation about whether to include the textbook in the study. In the first textbook examination
round, the three authors unanimously agreed to
include 12 textbooks in the study, and to exclude 9
textbooks, with an interrater agreement of 92.4%. In
the second round, we reexamined the three remaining textbooks and through consensus decided
to retain two. Through this process, 10 textbooks
were eliminated, leaving us with 14 texts that in
some way discussed firm start-up.
Once the textbooks had been selected for inclusion in the study, we employed two research assistants to help us identify if the start-up activities
that are listed in the PSED dataset were covered in
the textbook. To do this, the research assistants
were given a table of activities and then, working
independently, systematically went through each
textbook and noted the chapter and page numbers
where the activity was discussed. To ensure that

<-----Page 4----->60

the activities were covered in a substantial way in
the books, activities that were casually mentioned
but did not have a paragraph or more of textbook

March

space devoted to them, were deemed to be not
covered by the book. We compared the tables created by the two research assistants and found very

Textbook Objectives
The key issues in this book revolve around
the customer, the product/service, the
process, the organization and leadership
(p. xx).
Launching New Ventures is organized
around the process of creating new
ventures, from recognition of an
opportunity to launch of the business (p.
xv).
Our guiding principle when writing this
book is that entrepreneurship is a
process which unfolds through several
distinct phases (p. ix).
The Guru Guide to Entrepreneurship is a
clear, concise, and informative guide to
the wisdom of some of the world’s most
successful entrepreneurs (p. ix).
The book is for would-be entrepreneurs,
people who have started small firms
and others who want to improve their
entrepreneurial skills—indeed anyone
who wants to get involved in the birth
and growth of an enterprise (p. viii).
Entrepreneurship is Action! conveys the
exciting realities of entrepreneurship (p.
xvii).
Entrepreneurship: Strategies & Resources
is organized into three major areas:
theories and themes; the environment
for entrepreneurship, and the
formulation and implementation of
entrepreneurial strategy (pp. xix–xxi).
How to Really Start Your Own Business
provides extensive worksheets and
lessons so readers can evaluate their
own business ideas and plans (p. ix).
To provide an understanding of the person
and process of creating and growing a
new venture (p. xix).
To structure and illustrate the discipline of
entrepreneurship in a manner that is as
unique and creative an entrepreneurship
itself (p. xiii).
Entrepreneurship occurs in varying
degrees and amounts and environments
can be created in ways that heighten
entrepreneurial intensity at all three
levels (p. xvii).
The readings assembled here attempt to
cover the spectrum of the
entrepreneurial experience, from idea
generation to harvest (p. 3).

high interrater reliability (81% agreement; Cohen’s
kappa coefficient 61.4%), thereby providing us with
confidence in our findings. Table 2 presents a list
of textbooks, their authors and publishers, and the
objectives of the book, if stated.
Using the textbook data as a proxy for what is
taught in the classroom, we compared it to the
activities reported by nascent entrepreneurs in the
PSED dataset (see Hess, 1987 for a similar empirical approach in his assessment of the relevance of
small business courses to management needs).
Data on Nascent Entrepreneurs
The data utilized for the current investigation were
drawn from the National Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED). The PSED is designed to
investigate the earliest stage of the organizational
life cycle. PSED looks at the process of new business creation, or “the number and characteristics
of nascent entrepreneurs who attempt to start businesses and the likelihood that such attempts will
result in the formation of new businesses” (Gartner, Shaver, Carter, & Reynolds, 2004: ix). Nascent
entrepreneurs were defined as individuals involved in attempting to start a new business
within the past 12 months on their own (i.e., autonomous start-ups) as opposed to those doing so with
sponsorship from existing firms, who had not
achieved a positive cash flow for more than 3
months. As part of a national survey, a total of
64,622 individuals in the United States were contacted through random digit dialing by a marketing research firm. During these telephone interviews, two questions were used to identify those
individuals who were in the process of starting a
new venture: (1) “Are you alone or with others, now

trying to start a business?” and (2) “Are you alone,
or with others, now trying to start a new venture for
your employer?” Respondents who answered yes
to either question were then asked two additional
questions that determined whether they were actively involved in the start-up process and whether
they would share in the ownership of the new
venture. Positive answers to both questions qualified an individual as a nascent entrepreneur to be
requested to participate in the national panel
study. Qualifying individuals were offered a monetary inducement ($25) for their participation.
The PSED data were collected through a series of
four waves of telephone interviews conducted at
approximately 1-year intervals by researchers at
the University of Wisconsin between 1998 and 2003.
In addition, a mail survey was also distributed
after each wave of phone interviews, but it is outside of the scope of our study. Given the complexity of the PSED, in 2004 a handbook was published
as a guide for researchers using the dataset (Gartner et al., 2004). For researchers who are interested
in examining the database, the first four iterations
are available on the University of Michigan Web
site (http://projects.isr.umich.edu/PSED) along with
a codebook for deciphering the variables. Appendix B provides further information on the PSED
data collection process including the timing of the
data collection waves.
Nascent Entrepreneurs’ Sample

Shaver, Carter, Gartner, and Reynolds (2001), the
sample we used here and for which we report

interview had been involved in attempting to start
a new business within the past 12 months, but had
not received a positive cash flow from their new
businesses for more than 3 months (N ⫽ 715). Data
on the start-up status from the three waves of follow-up phone interviews were available for 582
nascent ventures, or 81.53% of the initial sample,
for which we report the association of entrepreneurial activities with the achievement of operating status. The approximately 20% attrition rate is
comparable to similar longitudinal studies of nascent entrepreneurs in other national contexts (e.g.,
see, Delmar & Shane, 2003, 2004).
About two thirds of the nascent entrepreneurs in
the sample were male, and 66.9% were White. Age
ranged between 18 and 74 years, with a mean of
38.36 years. Seventy-four percent had at least some
college education, and more than half had taken
business classes or workshops on starting a new
business. Work experience ranged between 0 and
60 years, with a mean of 17.01 years. The nascent
entrepreneurs contemplated entry into five industrial sectors, with the most popular sector being
consumer services and retail (48.5% of the nascent
entrepreneurial ventures). Slightly over 40% of the
nascent businesses had achieved operating status
during the time of the study, and the remaining
60% were continuing the organizing effort or had
been disbanded. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for the sample.
Measures
Start-Up Activities
Based on previous empirical work (Gatewood et
al., 1995; Carter et al., 1996) the PSED tracks 27

start-up activities (see Appendix A). Out of the 27,
twenty-six were measured by a self-reported dichotomous variable indicating whether nascent
entrepreneurs had engaged in that particular activity prior to or at the time of the initial and three
subsequent phone interviews. One of the activities—new product development—was measured
using an ordinal scale, which ranged from “no
work done” to “product completed and ready for
sale.” We kept the original measures (both dichotomous and ordinal scales) as developed by the
authors to ensure consistency.
Enhancing the Probability of Start-Up
During the follow-up interviews, nascent entrepreneurs reported their perceptions of the start-up status, using an ordinal scale which included (1) An
operating business; (2) Active start-up; (3) Inactive
start-up; and (4) No longer being worked by anyone. Following Delmar and Shane (2002), we measured enhancing the probability of start-up as the
achievement of an operating status. To this end,
we tracked responses from the three waves of follow-up phone interviews, and collapsed the four
response categories into two: (1) An operating business; (2) Not yet operating or disbanded (active
start-ups, inactive start-ups, and start-ups no
longer being worked on by anyone).
Analytical Procedures
To address Research Question 1, we compared the
percent of textbooks that cover a specific activity to
the percent of nascent entrepreneurs who report
engaging in that activity. More specifically, we

<-----Page 7----->2008

Edelman, Manolova, and Brush

ranked the start-up activities in descending order
based on the percent of textbooks that cover a
particular activity. Following the logic of betweengroup comparisons based on median splits (Rocha
& Stenberg, 2005; Atuahene-Gima & Ko, 2001;
Krueger, 1993), we split the array at 50%. Similarly,
we ranked in descending order the start-up activities, based on the percent of nascent entrepreneurs who report engaging in the activity, and
split the array at 50%. Based on the percentage
coverage by books and nascent entrepreneurs, respectively, we then classified the activities into
four clusters. Group 1 activities are covered by 50%
or more of the textbooks and practiced by 50% or
more of the nascent entrepreneurs. Group 2 activities are covered by 50% or more of the textbooks
but practiced by less than 50% of the nascent entrepreneurs. Group 3 activities are covered by less
than 50% of the textbooks, but practiced by 50% or
more of the nascent entrepreneurs. Finally, Group
4 activities are covered by less than 50% of the
textbooks and practiced by less than 50% of the
nascent entrepreneurs. An analysis of variance
(Pillai’s Trace F ⫽ 46.000, p ⬍ .001) confirmed the
internal validity of the two dimensions (percent
textbooks covering and activity and percent nascent entrepreneurs engaged in an activity, respectively) and of the 4-cluster solution.
To address Research Question 2, we first determined which entrepreneurial activities are likely
to enhance the probability of start-up, that is,
which activities are likely to differentiate between
those nascent ventures which achieve operating
status versus those that have either not achieved
operating status or have been disbanded. To this
end, we cross-tabulated the counts of nascent entrepreneurs engaging in a specific activity by the
counts of nascent entrepreneurs reporting the nascent venture’s start-up status (operating business
vs. not an operating business) and employed a
chi-square test to determine significant differences
between the counts. We found that 19 start-up activities were significantly associated with an operating business status and 8 activities were not.
For example, 90.16% of the nascent entrepreneurs
in operational new ventures had started marketing
efforts, compared with 63.31% among nascent entrepreneurs in not-yet operational or disbanded
ventures. In contrast, almost all nascent entrepreneurs had engaged in the development of a product or service, and so this activity failed to significantly differentiate between operating and notoperating new ventures. Results are presented in
Table 4.
We then compared whether the entrepreneurial
activities that are associated with enhancing the

63

probability of start-up are covered by the majority
of entrepreneurship textbooks or practiced by the
majority of nascent entrepreneurs. Unlike our other
methods, this evaluation is qualitative.
RESULTS
Research Question 1:
Are we teaching the same start-up activities that
nascent entrepreneurs practice?
This question explored whether nascent entrepreneurs engaged in the same activities as entrepreneurship textbooks prescribe. Results are presented
in Table 5 and suggest a sizeable discrepancy between the activities typically presented in entrepreneurship textbooks and the activities practiced by
nascent entrepreneurs.
In 7 of the 27 activities we tracked (or 26%) the
high prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs corresponds to a high percentage of textbook coverage, and in 9 activities (33%) the high prevalence
among nascent entrepreneurs corresponds to a low
percentage of textbook coverage. In 4 activities
(15%), there is high coverage in textbooks, but low
prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs, while in
7 activities (26%), there is high prevalence among
nascent entrepreneurs, but low percent of textbook
coverage. Our analysis shows significant differences in the proportion of textbooks that covered a
particular activity and the proportion of nascent
entrepreneurs who reported engaging in this activity. Overall, there appears to be a disconnect in
over 40% of the start-up activities. Indeed, while
there are two groups of activities where high prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs corresponds
to a high percentage of textbook coverage, and low
prevalence among nascent entrepreneurs corresponds to a low percentage of textbook coverage
(Groups 1 and 4, respectively), there are groups of
activities significantly more emphasized by textbooks in comparison to practice (Group 2 activities)
and those significantly more emphasized in practice in comparison to the textbooks (Group 3 activities). For example, an important anchor such as
purchased or leased equipment was reported by
67.1% of the nascent entrepreneurs but was discussed in only 14.29% of the textbooks. In contrast,
over two thirds of the textbooks discussed applying for a patent, even though less than a fifth of the
nascent entrepreneurs reported engaging in this
activity. What is more, textbooks do not appear to
cover all activities in which nascent entrepreneurs
engage (6/27, or 22% of the start-up activities we
tracked were not mentioned in the entrepreneurship textbooks). This suggests that entrepreneur-

ship textbooks may not present the scope of activities involved in starting a new venture in its
completeness and may overemphasize certain
start-up activities at the expense of others. In sum,
entrepreneurship textbooks do not appear to be
covering the same activities in which nascent entrepreneurs are engaged, which indicates a gap
between practice and what is taught to entrepreneurship students in the classroom.
Research Question 2:
Are we teaching the start-up activities that
enhance the probability that nascent
entrepreneurs will start a new venture?
Our second research question asked whether the
nascent activities that are emphasized by entrepreneurship textbooks are more likely to enhance
the start-up process. To explore this question, we

integrated the results from Table 4 into Table 5.
Results suggest 6 out of the 19 activities associated
with enhancing the probability of start-up (or less
than one third) are discussed in the majority of the
entrepreneurship texts. Further, 9/19 (or about half)
of the activities associated with enhancing the
probability of start-up are mentioned in some of
the entrepreneurship texts, while 4/19 (or one fifth)
of the activities associated with enhancing the
probability of start-up find no mention at all. In
relative terms, the majority of entrepreneurship
texts cover 11 activities, of which 6 (or 55%) are
associated with enhancing the probability of startup. In contrast, 16 of the start-up activities we
tracked are covered in less than 50% of the entrepreneurship texts, but out of these 16 activities, 13
(or over 80%) are significantly associated with enhancing the probability of start-up.

activities that enhance the probability of starting a
new venture.
DISCUSSION
We have examined the relevance of entrepreneurship education by examining two research questions that explore the content of what we are teaching in entrepreneurship classrooms as compared
to the start-up practices of nascent entrepreneurs.
We used textbooks as a proxy for course content
after finding syllabi for the top schools teaching
entrepreneurship anchored their courses with a
text. Our findings suggest that what is emphasized
in the traditional entrepreneurship texts, and
hence in many of our classrooms, is in many cases
different from the start-up reality faced by nascent
entrepreneurs. This suggests that as educators in
entrepreneurship, we need to carefully think about
the content of our courses in terms of what we are
emphasizing, in an effort to make our courses relevant to future entrepreneurs.
With respect to what we are teaching, our findings indicate that there is incongruence between
what is emphasized in textbooks and the activities
practiced by nascent entrepreneurs. This implies
that as educators who want to make our courses
more relevant to real-world experiences, we should
include those activity categories that are currently
not emphasized in the textbooks but are vital to practicing entrepreneurs. In particular, an emphasis on
“actions” rather than “research and plan writing”
would be appropriate (Timmons & Spinelli, 2004).
While textbooks often have chapters on contracting
with suppliers, supply chain analysis or other aspects of operations, the setting up of these operations
is not well addressed. Operational activities such as
how to arrange initial purchase of raw materials or
equipment, or how to establish credit with suppliers
were important to entrepreneurs but were not emphasized in texts. Further, boundary-building activities such as registering a business with authorities
or signing up to pay taxes are critically important for
establishing legitimacy and enhancing the probability of successful firm emergence, but were deemphasized by both nascent entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship texts. In sum, while instructors may be
supplementing text content with case analyses or
experiential exercises, there is a strong suggestion
that initial start-up activities are underemphasized in course content.
More difficult to interpret are the findings regarding business planning. Test results show that
nascent entrepreneurs generally did not empha-

March

size business planning as much as textbooks do,
and, more important, that business planning did
not appear to be a good start-up predictor (see
Table 5). Empirical evidence from the Swedish
PSED dataset, on the other hand, emphasizes the
importance of planning (Delmar & Shane, 2003,
2004; Shane & Delmar, 2004).1 In addition, Lange et
al. (2005) find that business owners that wrote business plans were more likely to have raised more
capital, but find no correlation between writing a
business plan and future revenues. This implies
that there are different types of planning that
might be used for different purposes, such as to
achieve external legitimacy or to communicate the
strategic direction of the business internally (Stone
& Brush, 1996).
Recent work on entrepreneurship pedagogy
(Honig, 2004) suggests that it is not planning that is
at issue in entrepreneurship classes, but instead
the way in which planning is approached. While in
no way suggesting that the critical thinking process, which is typically the rationale behind the
writing of a business plan assignment, is unimportant, Honig (2004) calls for an end to the emphasis
on the linear notion of writing a business plan. He
argues that the business plan, as is currently used
in entrepreneurship courses, does not encourage
would-be entrepreneurs to engage in the complex,
nonlinear thinking patterns that are needed during
start-up. He suggests that nonlinear teaching approaches, such as simulations, are better preparation for future entrepreneurs.
Recognizing the shortcomings of exclusively using textbooks in entrepreneurship courses, we suggest that while entrepreneurship instructors may
want to use a text to present basic theoretical principles, they should consider augmenting the text
with as many hands-on practical experiences as
possible (Leitch & Harrison, 1999; Fiet, 2000). This
would allow instructors to cover important theoretical concepts and to help students improve divergent thinking processes that can assist in discovering alternative solutions (Honig, 2004). Similarly, as
DeTienne and Chandler (2004) suggest, encouragement of idea generation is a natural step in helping
entrepreneurs to identify more opportunities. These
might include improvisation, drawing, doing col-

1

The divergent findings between our study and the Swedish
PSED studies (Delmar & Shane, 2003, 2004) may be the result of
different institutional contexts (e.g., the Swedish economy is
more highly regulated making planning more important), or the
sampling schema (the Swedish study only included entrepreneurial initiatives commenced within the first 9 months of 1998
and followed them over the subsequent 30 months as compared
with the U.S study which followed firms for up to 4 years).

<-----Page 11----->2008

lages, and other means to invoke creative alternative
approaches to early venture creation. In addition,
simulations can be useful to creating nonlinear
thinking skills, such as making use of multiple
sources of information and the assembly of diverse
information into a cogent, meaningful whole upon
which decisions can be based (Honig, 2004).
IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION
In this study we examined whether our current entrepreneurship educational practices are relevant to
what actual entrepreneurs are practicing. We did
this by examining the differences between what is
emphasized in entrepreneurship textbooks and the
activities in which nascent entrepreneurs are engaged. Our study is grounded in theoretical perspectives on organizing in nascent organizations (Katz &
Gartner, 1988; Aldrich, 1999; Shane & Delmar, 2004),
as well as in notions of relevance (Sperber & Wilson,
1996; Wilson & Sperber, 2003). While we found a number of areas of convergence; we were disturbed to
also find that there are a number of activities that are
not adequately discussed in textbooks, and as important, there are activities that enhance the probability of start-up that are not discussed by textbooks
or practiced by nascent entrepreneurs. This suggests
that as entrepreneurship educators, we face a challenge as we try to make our courses more relevant
with respect to actual practice.
While our findings clearly indicate a lack of correspondence between teaching and practice, our work
is not without limitations. In this study we used textbooks as a proxy for what is being taught in the
classroom. In fairness, textbooks are typically used
as guides, and talented instructors augment them
with their own experiences and examples. In addition, the textbooks used in our study typically were
not limited in content to only start-up activities, but
instead contained information on many topics relevant to those interested in starting a new venture.
This suggests that the decision made by the textbook
editors to include multiple entrepreneurship topics
in a single text, may have led to some activities
receiving greater or lesser textbook coverage.
While there is precedent for using textbooks as a
proxy for what is being taught in the classroom
(Hess, 1987), we could have adopted alternative
methodologies to examine our research questions.
For example, instead of textbooks, we could have
surveyed or conducted in-depth interviews with entrepreneurship educators. While this would have
eliminated the potential for textbook-based bias in
our inquiry, each alternative method of inquiry has

67

its own well-documented limitations (e.g., low response rate and the accuracy and completeness of
responses for surveys and problems with bias due to
interviewer effects coupled with a propensity for interviewees to provide socially desirable answers
during interviews (Judd, Smith, & Kidder, 1991).
Finally, while the start-up activities listed in the
PSED dataset are drawn from previous scholarship
on nascent entrepreneurs (Reynolds & Miller 1992;
Gatewood, Shaver, & Gartner, 1995; Carter, Gartner,
& Reynolds 1996), the distinction between an activity
and a skill that is necessary at a particular stage of
development may not be clear. This lack of clarity
may limit textbook coverage of a particular activity.
Future research on entrepreneurship teaching and
scholarship could focus on when particular activities
are conducted in an effort to distinguish between all
start-up activities and those activities that are more
likely during particular start-up stages.
Some scholars make the distinction that steps to
start-up are not the same for small firms and entrepreneurial new ventures. In addition, most textbooks
do not distinguish between being targeted to entrepreneurial firms or small businesses. Here, we follow Kirchhoff (1994), who suggests small/new firms
may exhibit different degrees of entrepreneurial behavior. Kirchhoff (1994) anchors his perspective in
Schumpeter (1935) and argues that high goals for
innovation and growth may lead to “glamorous”
firms, while those with low innovation and growth
may be part of the “economic core.” We don’t believe
there is a clear-cut dichotomy between these two
types of firms at the nascent stage. Therefore activities leading to start-up may not necessarily be differentiated by the distinction between “small” and
“entrepreneurial.”
Our study highlights, however, that as educators,
we need to consider the relevance of our curriculum
in terms of what is taught in our classrooms. The
importance of new ventures is well established in
our economy, as is the need to teach classes that
permit students to learn about new ventures, small
firm management, entrepreneurial competences,
and growth strategies. Given the proliferation of
classes, it appears that entrepreneurship is “legitimated” as a course of study (Vesper & Gartner, 1997;
Katz, 2003). However, the gap we find between
start-up practices of nascent entrepreneurs and
those prescribed by entrepreneurship texts suggests
that to maintain legitimacy and enhance the relevance of our curriculum, we need to improve on our
course content to better meet our constituents’ needs.
Therefore, we suggest a renewed focus on the content of entrepreneurship education.

APPENDIX B
STRUCTURE AND METHODOLOGY OF THE PSED
DATA SET
The Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) is designed to investigate the earliest stage of the organizational
life-cycle. PSED looks at the process of new business creation,
or “the number and characteristics of nascent entrepreneurs
who attempt to start businesses and the likelihood that such
attempts will result in the formation of new businesses” (Gartner, Shaver, Carter, & Reynolds, 2004a: ix). For consistency with
other research based on the Panel Study of Entrepreneurship
Dynamics, we followed the classification scheme developed by
Shaver, Carter, Gartner, and Reynolds (2001), which defines a
nascent entrepreneur as someone who has not received a positive cash flow from the new business for more than 3 months.
This decision rule was established in order to differentiate new
businesses “in the process of emergence” from already established new businesses.
PSED consists of one initial and three follow-up phone surveys, which track a nationally representative sample of nascent
entrepreneurs over the course of 5 years (a mail survey is

March

another component of the dataset, but it is outside of the scope
of our study). The idea was to track the number and characteristics of individuals who attempt to start up a business, as well
as the characteristics and outcomes of the entrepreneurial
start-up process. The dataset combines respondents’ answers to
survey questions from the four interview waves of the study.
Thus, for each respondent the dataset contains information
whether a specific start-up activity was undertaken over the
course of the study, and if yes, in what month and year it was
undertaken. For example, at the time of the initial data collection (Wave 1 of the phone interviews), a respondent may have
reported not completing a business plan, but may subsequently
report that a business plan has been completed (at the time of
Waves 2, 3, or 4). We would count that a business plan has been
completed regardless of the timing of this start-up activity.
The PSED study identifies individuals who reported that they
were trying to start a new business within the 12 months preceding the initial wave of the study (Wave 1 of the phone
survey), which took place in 1998 –1999. The question that asked
about the perceived outcome of the entrepreneurial initiative
(whether the nascent entrepreneur believed the new business
was already operating, an active start-up, an inactive start-up,
or no longer being worked on by anyone) was asked in the
follow-up waves of data collection (e.g., in Waves 2, 3, and 4 of
the phone survey), which took place, as follows: Wave 2 (1999 –
200l), Wave 3 (2001–2003), and Wave 4 (2003). If a nascent entrepreneur reported that the new business was already operating
or that it was no longer being worked by anyone, that case was
not tracked from that point on. If, however, a nascent entrepreneur reported that the business was still a start-up (active or
inactive), the case was tracked in subsequent data collection
waves. Thus, for each initially identified nascent entrepreneur,
the dataset contains information on the outcome of the start-up
process over the course of 5 years (1998 –2003).
Given the widespread interest in the PSED dataset, a number
of volumes specifically devoted to nascent entrepreneurs have
been published. Gartner, Shaver, Carter, and Reynolds (2004)
edited a book entitled The Handbook of Entrepreneurial Dynamics: The Process of Organization Creation, which details the
PSED data collection process while a recent book in the Foundations and Trends in Entrepreneurship series entitled Nascent
Entrepreneurs by Davidsson (2006) has an extensive review of
over 75 papers on nascent entrepreneurship, many of them
using PSED data.
