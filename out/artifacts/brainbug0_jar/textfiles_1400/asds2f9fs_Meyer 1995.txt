1. INTRODUCTION

is evident in past research,but naturalexperimentscertainly
give it more emphasis.
A couple of examples illustratehow a naturalexperiment
may allow the studyof theeffects of exogenous variationin an
explanatoryvariablethat is in other situationsendogenously
relatedto the outcome of interest. First, in studies of the effects of social insuranceprogramson laborsupply it is often
difficult to distinguishthe effects of an individual's benefit
entitlementfrom the effects of past labor supply and earnings thattypicallydeterminethatbenefitentitlement.Specifically, programssuch as unemploymentinsurance,workers'
compensation,and Social Security condition eligibility and
the level of benefits on previous earnings. Previous earnings arehighly correlatedwith futureearningsandthe payoff
to work. Thus, in studies of the effects of these programs
on employmentand earnings,it may be difficult to separate
the independentinfluences of earnings history from benefit generosity. This problemis typically exacerbatedby the
use of proxies for the relevantearningsand benefit variables
so that idiosyncraticand potentially exogenous variationin
the benefit variablesis often lost. Because of this concern,
many recent studies have examinedchanges in social insurance benefits that applied to certain groups but not others.
For example, Classen (1979), Solon (1985), Meyer (1989,
1992), and Green and Riddell (1993a,b) examined unemploymentinsurance,and Meyer, Viscusi, and Durbin(1990,
in press), Krueger(1990), Gardner(1991), and Curington
(1994) examinedworkers'compensation.
A second example is provided by studies of the effects
of militaryservice on earnings.Workthat comparescivilian
earnings by veteran status may be biased if a nonrandom
group of individuals serves in the military. In particular,
those who enlist may face worse labor-marketopportunities
thanthose who do notenlist. Alternatively,militaryinduction
may screen out those individuals in worse health. Recent

There has been an outburstof work in economics that
adopts the language and conceptualframeworkof randomized experiments. These studies, which are often called
"naturalexperiments,"examine outcome measuresfor observations in treatmentgroups and comparisongroups that
are not randomly assigned. Much attentionis often paid to
findingsuitablecomparisongroups. This articleanalyzesthe
strengthsand weaknesses of these new studies anddescribes
how futurework can be improved.
I argue that these naturalexperimentscan be improved
throughthe use of more complicatedresearchdesigns. In
particular,multiple treatmentand comparisongroups allow
furtherchecks of hypothesesandmay allow hypothesesto be
refinedandalternativeexplanationsto be ruledout. Similarly,
multiplepreinterventionorpostinterventionobservationscan
be used to examine the comparabilityof comparisongroups
andthe influencesof omittedfactors. These andotherdesign
features can increase the validity of inferences that can be
drawnfrom naturalexperiments.
Good natural experiments are studies in which there is
a transparentexogenous source of variationin the explanatory variables that determinethe treatmentassignment. A
naturalexperimentinduced by policy changes, government
randomization,or otherevents may allow a researcherto obtain exogenous variationin the main explanatoryvariables.
This occurrence is especially useful in situations in which
estimates are ordinarilybiased because of endogenousvariation due to omitted variablesor selection. Such approaches
have recently been used to analyze a wide range of issues.
The natural-experimentapproachemphasizesthe generalissue of understandingthe sourcesof variationused to estimate
the key parameters. In my view, this is the main lesson of
these studies. If one cannotexperimentallycontrolthe variation one is using, one shouldunderstandits source. This idea
151

work has overcome this problem by using the variationin
veterans' status caused by the Vietnam-eradraft lottery or
the WorldWarII draftmechanism,which dependedon date
of birth (Angrist 1990; Angrist and Krueger 1994). Other
researchuses variationacrosscohortsin conscriptionratesin
the Netherlands(Imbensand van der Klaauw 1994).
Othertopics thathave been examinedusing naturalexperiment approachesinclude, though are by no means limited
to, the effects of minimum wage laws through studies of
changes in state laws (Card 1992a;Cardand Krueger1994)
and federal law (Card 1992b; Katz and Krueger1992); the
effects of immigrantson the employmentand wages of natives throughstudiesof the impactsof largeinfluxesof immigrants(Card 1990; Hunt 1992); the effects of family size on
family choices using the deliveryof twins as exogenousvariation (Bronarsand Grogger 1993; Rozensweig and Wolpin
1980); the effects of taxes on labor supply and investment
by examiningtax reforms(Cummins,Hassett,and Hubbard
1994; Eissa 1993); the effects of Medicaid on health, labor
supply,andAid to Familieswith DependentChildrenparticipation throughstudies of programexpansionsthat have expandedeligibility to certaingroups(CurrieandGruber1993;
Yelowitz 1994) andrelatedworkon Canada(Hanratty1992);
and the effects of liquidity constraintson investmentusing
changes in oil prices as shocks to the cash flow of nonoil
subsidiaries(Lamont 1993).
There are certainly many antecedents to this literature.
Examples in economics include Rose (1952), who analyzed
strikeratesbefore and aftercompulsorymediationlaws, and
Simon (1966) who examined liquor sales before and after
state price increases. Both authorsused comparisonstates
thatdid not have law or price changes. Many of the research
designsdiscussedherehavebeenextensivelyanalyzedin psychology, where they are called quasi-experiments.Because
there is a rich traditionof use of these methods in psychology, I will often refer to the parallel terms and literature
from that discipline. The term quasi-experimentsemphasizes that such studies are not quite experiments. The term
naturalexperiments,which is more commonly used in economics, somewhatinappropriatelysuggeststhatthesestudies
are experimentsand moreoverthatthey are spontaneous.In
economics we have not settled on a name for the approach
of conventionalstudies, where the process that determines
the variationin the key explanatoryvariablesis not knownor
modeled. In psychology such studiesarecalled correlational
designs, or static-groupcomparisons.Such studiesarebased
on variationthatcommonlyoccurs,usuallyin a cross-section.
The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines some
general problems, drawing inferences in empirical work.
Section 3 describes the main researchdesigns used in naitural experiments. Section 4 describes extensions to these
methods, and Section 5 indicates ways of probingthe comparabilityof comparison groups. Section 6 outlines ways
that the hypotheses undertest can be furtherexamined,and
Section 7 describes the sources of exogenous variationin
naturalexperimentsand other studies. Section 8 describes
instrumentalvariables methods that have been used when

treatmentassignmentis imprecise. Section 9 discusses how
to interpretthe results from naturalexperiments, and Section 10 concludes.

2. THREATSTO VALIDITY
It is useful to begin by outlining some of the general
problems with drawingeconomic conclusions from empirical studies. Because these problems apply to some extent
to all of the researchdesigns discussed here, it is useful first
to describethem in general. A good startingpoint is Donald
Campbell's (Campbell 1957, 1969; Campbell and Stanley
1966; Cook and Campbell 1979) list of "threatsto validity."
These threatsare problems that may underminethe causal
interpretationsin studies. The examination of threatsis a
study-by-studyproblem.A detailedknowledgeof the theory,
institutions,datacollection, andotherbackgroundrelevantto
a topic is necessarytojudge the importanceof these problems
for a given study.

2.1 Threats to InternalValidity
Internalvalidityrefersto whetherone can validly drawthe
inferencethatwithin the context of the study the differences
in the dependentvariableswere caused by the differencesin
the relevantexplanatoryvariables. Although I have altered
the list of threatsand their descriptionsto make them more
relevantto economics, the debt to Campbellis clear:
1. Omittedvariables:Events, otherthan the experimental treatment,occurringbetween preinterventionand postinterventionobservationsthat provide alternativeexplanations for the results.
2. Trends in outcomes: Processes within the units of
observationsproducingchanges as a function of the passage
of time per se, such as inflation,aging, and wage growth.
3. Misspecifiedvariances:The overstatementof the significanceof statisticaltests due to effects such as the omission
of grouperrortermsthatindicatethatoutcomesfor individual
units are correlated.
4. Mismeasurement:Changes in definitions or survey
methodsthatmayproducechangesin the measuredvariables.
This wouldincludechangesin surveywordingorquestionorder. For example, therehave been importantrecent changes
of this kind in the CurrentPopulationSurvey(CPS) unemployment and educationquestions. One might also include
in this category seam-bias problems in which higher levels
of changes(e.g., becomingunemployedor going on welfare)
are reportedfor periods that straddlesuccessive interviews
than are reportedfor analogous time periods that are surveyed in the same interview (Citro and Kalton 1993) and
time-in-surveyeffects such as rotation-groupbias in the CPS
unemploymentrate (Bailar 1975).
5. Political economy: Endogeneity of policy changes
due to governmentalresponses to variablesassociated with
past or expectedfutureoutcomes.
6. Simultaneity: Endogeneity of explanatoryvariables
due to theirjoint determinationwith outcomes.

<-----Page 3----->andQuasi-Experiments

Meyer:Natural
7. Selection: Assignment of observationsto treatment
groupsin a mannerthatleads to correlationbetween assignmentandoutcomesin the absenceof treatment.Selectioncan
takemanyforms. Forexample,observationsmay be assigned
to a treatmentgroupbased on previousextremevalues of the
dependentvariableorvariablesassociatedwiththedependent
variable.In the trainingliterature,it has beenemphasizedthat
a decline in earningsfrequentlyprecedes programentrybecause programoperatorstendto enrollthose individualswith
recentlabor-marketproblems(Ashenfelter1978;Ashenfelter
and Card 1985; Heckmanand Smith 1994). This rule for selecting participantsmakes comparisonsof changes in earnings for participantsand nonparticipantsdifficult. Different
types of selection will have differentremedies. Forexample,
selection based on time-invariantindividualcharacteristics
possibly may be differencedaway, but selection bias based
on the lagged dependentvariable could be exaggeratedby
this approach. The general selection problemis the subject
of an extensiveliterature,as discussedby HeckmanandRobb
(1985) and Manski (1989).
8. Attrition: The differentialloss of respondentsfrom
treatmentand comparisongroups. For example, Hausman
and Wise (1979) examined attritionof individuals from a
randomizedexperiment, and Pakes and Ericson (1990) examined attritionfrom a firm panel due to liquidationsand
changes in ownership.
9. Omittedinteractions:Differentialtrendsin treatment
and controlgroupsor omittedvariablesthatchangein different ways for treatmentand control groups. An example is a
time trendin a treatmentgroupthatis notpresentin a comparison group. The exclusion of such interactionsis a common
identifyingassumptionin the designs of naturalexperiments.
I should emphasize that this list is a practicallist of concerns rather than an exhaustive list of possible problems.
Campbell's list was modified several times in later work by
Campbell and others (Cook and Campbell 1979; Cook and
Shadish 1994). This later work emphasizedsuch threatsas
"diffusion and imitation of treatments"and the "compensatory equalizationof treatments."These ideas are similar
to the observationin recent studies of trainingthat the controlsoften receive some trainingthroughotherprogramseven
when they are denied entry to the programbeing studied.

2.2 Threats to External Validity
Cook andCampbell(1979) enumeratedthreethreatsto external validity. Externalvalidity deals with whethereffects
found in an experimentcan be generalizedto differentindividuals, contexts, and outcomes. In essence, these threatsto
externalvalidity arejust the possibility thatthereare important interactionsbetween the treatmentand individualcharacteristics,location, or time:
1. Interactionof selection and treatment:Unrepresentative responsivenessof the treatedpopulation. The treatment
groupmay not be representativeof certainpopulation,or the
treatmentmay be differentfrom that which one would like
to examine.

153

2. Interactionof setting and treatment: The effect of
the treatmentmay differ across geographic or institutional
settings.
3. Interactionof historyandtreatment:The effect of the
treatmentmay differ across time periods.
Examples of such interactionscome from studies in which
the treatmentinvolves changing a key explanatoryvariable
(the workers'compensationbenefit or the minimum wage)
fromone valueto another.The effect of a given changein this
explanatoryvariablemay dependon the rangeof the variable
over which this change is made and the composition of the
treatmentgroup. This issue is of particularconcern if one
seeks to extrapolatethe results. This problem is not unique
to naturalexperiments,however.
Cook and Campbell also enumerated10 threatsto what
they call "constructvalidity." This concept refers to confusion over what is actually the cause and effect, such as
confusion over the relevantpartof a treatmentthathas many
dimensions. Although these types of issues may not seem
importantin economics, they do arise. For example, Angrist
(1990) asked to what extent the effect on earningsof being
draft eligible is purely due to service in the military per se
ratherthanthe effects of draftavoidancebehaviorandspecial
educationalprogramsfor veterans. A second example is the
debate over signaling versus productiveschooling in which
it is asked whetherthe higherearningsof the more educated
are due to the credentials that signal ability or the lessons
that impartskills (EhrenbergandSmith [1994, pp. 308-312]
provideda nice summaryand references).
There are otherthreatsto the generalizabilityof study results that are again not uniqueto naturalexperiments. First,
one might expect difficulty in extrapolatingresults from a
temporarychangeto a permanentone in which individualsas
well as institutionsfully adaptto the new situation. Second,
one might expect general equilibriumresponse to changes
such as labor-marketdisplacementeffects. These issues and
othersreceivemuchattentionin the literatureon social experiments (Hausmanand Wise 1985, and more recently Meyer
in press;SpiegelmanandWoodbury1990). See also Manski
(1994) for severalresults on extrapolatingexperimentalevidence from one groupto another.

3. THERESEARCHDESIGNS
Threeof the main goals of a researchdesign should be (1)
findingvariationin the key explanatoryvariablesthat is exogenous, (2) findingcomparisongroupsthatarecomparable,
and(3) probingthe implicationsof the hypothesesundertest.
Withoutthe ability to experimentallyvary the relevantvariables, researchersshould seek to find variationthat is driven
by factors that are clearly identified and understood. One
can then make an informeddecision aboutthe exogeneity of
that variationand rule out other explanations. Being able
to rule out obvious sources of endogeneity is not enough,
however. The possibility of omitted variables,trendsin outcomes, omittedinteractions,and so forthplaces a burdenon
the researcherto examine the comparabilityof groups that

<-----Page 4----->154

Statistics,

arebeingcompared.Oftenotherinformationfromadditional
comparisongroups or time periods can be used to examine
comparability.It is also often possible to furtherprobe hypotheses by refiningthem and subjectingthem to additional
tests. These ideas need to be kept in mind when analyzing
the design of any study. Recent work thatemphasizessome
of these themes includes that of Rosenbaum(1987), Cook
(1991), and Cook and Shadish(1994).
There are a few study designs that have been commonly
used in naturalexperiments. Many other works use slight
variantson these designs. I begin with the simplestdesign.

3.1 The One GroupBeforeand AfterDesign
I beginwith this design becauseit is oftenused as a method
of preliminaryanalysis and becausemanyothermethodsare
logical extensions of this approach. In psychology, this approachhas been called the one grouppretest-posttestdesign.
In economics, this approachis often called differences,based
on the most common statisticcalculatedwith such data. This
approachis not very likely to lead to valid inferences, but
it may be appropriatein some situations. Most of the more
complicated designs are used to overcome some difficulty
or deficiency with this simple design or to determineif the
inferencesfrom it are valid.
The one groupbefore and afterdesign is motivatedby the
equation
(1)
Yi = + d, + Ei,,
in
unit
i
for
where yit is the outcome of interest
period t, t
= 0, 1, and i = 1,..., N,. d is a dummy variablefor being in the treatmentgroup-that is, dt = 1 if t = 1 and 0
otherwise-and i is the truecausaleffect of the treatmenton
the outcome for this group. The treatmentgroup is usually
defined (at least in part) by the variation in another variable such as the level of the minimumwage or the workers'
compensationbenefit. Examples of outcomes include employmentin the minimum-wagestudies or time out of work
in the workers'compensationstudies.
The key identifyingassumptionof this model is that,in the
absence of the treatment,i would be 0; that is, therewould
be no difference in the mean of those in group0 and group
1. This condition is typically writtenas E[Ei,I d,] = 0; that
is, the conditionalmean of the errortermdoes not dependon
the value of the treatmentdummy. Using a termcommon in
statistics,one might say that this conditionis implied by ignorabletreatmentassignment(Rubin1978). If this condition
holds, an unbiasedestimate of / can be obtainedas

d = ix
(2)
= Yl - Yo,
where the bar indicates an averageover the individualunits
andthe subscripton y denotes the time period. Undertypical
assumptions,fd would also be consistent as the numberof
units in each group goes to infinity. f can also be obtained
by directly estimating the parametersof Equation(1) using
pooled data from the two time periods. This regressionapproach will reproducepd and, if one allows the varianceof
Ei,to vary with t, give the same standarderror.

Although I focus on analyzing the mean difference between the treatmentgroup and the comparisongroup, other
summary measures of the differences in the distributions
may be of interest.These measures include quantiles such
as the median or 75th percentile and the cumulativedistribution function at certainpoints. For example, Meyer et al.
(in press)examinedboththe cumulativedistributionfunction
andquantilesof the outcomevariable,injuryduration.When
examining the effect of an explanatoryvariableon years of
educationreceived,we may be interestedin the fractionof a
groupgraduatingfromhigh school (a pointon the cumulative
distributionfunction).
Because nothing so far requiresdata on individualunits
ratherthangroupedmeans, one could use aggregatedatafor
thispretest-posttestapproach.One would need anestimateof
the variancesof any statisticsexamined,however,to conduct
statisticaltests. Some other advantagesof individual-level
dataare discussed later. If individualdata are used, the samples could be differentin the two periods;that is, one might
use repeatedcross-sectiondataratherthanpanel data.
The use of the one groupbefore and afterdesign requires
very special circumstances.One needs strong evidence that
the two groupswould have been comparableover time in the
absence of the treatment. An example that illustratesthis
issue is the work of Meyer et al. (1990, in press). These
authorsexaminedthe effect of the level of workers'compensation benefitson the length of time out of work by comparing individualsinjuredduringthe year before and after two
large increases in state maximum weekly benefit amounts.
These increasesraisedthe benefitamountfor an easily identified class of high-income workerswho were injuredafter
the changes in the state laws. In this example, there might
be other influences on injurydurationthat one would want
to rule out as explanationsfor any outcomes. One influence
wouldbe otherchangesin the law regardinginjurycompensation over the studyperiod(omittedvariables). Similarly,one
might be concernedaboutoveralltrendsin injuryseverityor
changesin the reportingpracticesof the insurancecompanies
that submitthe records(trendsin outcomes or mismeasurement). If the data were from a panel, one might be worried
about nonrandomexit from the sample (attrition).One way
to assess the importanceof these threats to internalvalidity is to examine the outcomes for similar groups that did
not receive the treatmentbut would presumablybe subject
to these influences as well. Such an idea leads to the next
design.
3.2

The Before and After Design With an Untreated

ComparisonGroup
Oftendatawill be availablefor the time period before and
afterthe treatmentfor a groupthatdoes not receive the treatment butexperiencessome or all of the otherinfluencesthat
affect the treatmentgroup. When such a group is present,
the design in psychology has been called the untreatedcontrol group design with pretest and posttest. In economics
the approachis identifiedwith the most common statistical
techniqueused in this situation,difference in differences.

<-----Page 5----->andQuasi-Experiments
inEconomics
Meyer:Natural
When one has a comparison group over the same time
period as the before and after groups, often the underlying
model of the outcome variableis of the form.

y =

+"fdt + Eit,
"+Tldt +oldi

(3)

where the outcome y is now also indexed by j for the group,
j = 0, 1, and dt = 1 if t = 1 and 0 otherwise, di = 1 if
j = 1 and 0 otherwise, and dt = 1 if t = 1 and j = 1
and 0 otherwise. dj is a dummy variablefor being in the
experimentalgroup after it receives the treatment,and P is
the true causal effect of the treatmenton the outcome for
this group. Again, the key identifying assumptionis that P
would be 0 in the absence of the treatment,or E[E/, I di] = 0.
In this case, and unbiasedestimate of p can be obtainedby
difference in differencesas
fiddd= L

-1
-1(4)
(4)
YI- Y - 6' - o)
whereagaina barindicatesan averageover i, the subscriptdenotes the time period, and the superscriptdenotes the group.
The key idea behindthis approachis thatoa summarizesthe
way that both groupj = 0 and groupj = 1 are influenced
by time. There may be a time-invariantdifferencein overall
means between the groupsj = 0 andj = 1, butthis aspectis
capturedby aoI.
This researchdesign is the essence of two recent studies.
Cardand Krueger(1994) examinedthe effects of an increase
in theNew Jerseystateminimumwage on employment.Their
sample consists of fast-food restaurantsfrom four chains in
New Jersey before (t = 0) and after (t = 1) the increase in
the minimumwage. In addition,they examinedemployment
at a sample of similar restaurantsin eastern Pennsylvania
over the same time period. This sample from Pennsylvania
provides a group (j = 0) that is plausibly subject to the
same changes over time as the group in New Jersey,except
that Pennsylvaniadid not change the minimumwage. These
common changes are capturedby otain Equation(3). This
term represents such things as macroeconomicconditions
and regionalgrowthtrendsin fast-foodemploymentover the
period.
Meyer et al. (1990, in press) examinedthe effects of two
large workers'compensationbenefit increaseson the length
of claims. They also reliedon anuntreatedcomparisongroup,
as well as before and aftergroups. The untreatedcomparison
groupis those individualswithina statewho were not subject
to the increases in workers' compensationbenefits because
they had averageor low earnings. These comparisonworkers
were likely to be subject to any other changes in program
administrationor insurers'claim-monitoringprocedures.
Again, i can be estimated directly by applying ordinary
least squares to Equation (3). This method reproducespdd
but gives a different standarderrorfor the estimate unless
one allows the errorvarianceto differ across the four groups
definedby t andj. An advantageof theregressionformulation
is that it makes clear that the key identifying assumptionis
that there is no interactionbetween t = 1 andj = 1 (except
for the influence understudy).

155

Several of the internal validity threats are reduced by
this approach,but importantconcerns may remain. In the
workers'compensationand minimumwage studies such influences as changes in other state laws and labor-market
conditions(omittedvariables)and any changes in surveyors'
methods (mismeasurement)are likely reduced by the use of
the untreatedcomparisongroup. The importanceof trendsin
employmentand the durationof workers' compensationreceipt (trendsin outcomes) is also reducedor eliminated. The
comparabilityof the before and aftergroupsis higherif sample attritionis negligible. Cardand Krueger(1994) went to
greatlengthsto determinethe statusand employmentof nonrespondingestablishmentsin their panel study. In repeated
cross-section studies one usually does not have an attrition
problem,butone needs to examineif the samplesareselected
over time in the same way from comparablepopulations.
One of the main threatsto the validity of inferencesfrom
this design is the possibility of an interaction(besides the
treatment)betweenj = 1 and t = 1 (omitted interactions).
Changes in other state laws or macroeconomic conditions
are not likely to always influenceall groupsin the same way.
A recession may have a disproportionateeffect on one income groupcomparedto anotheror in one statethananother.
This design is most plausiblewhen the untreatedcomparison
group is very similar to the treatmentgroup so that interactions are less likely.
A situation favorableto this design is one in which the
comparisongroup both before and after has a distribution
of outcomes close to that for the treatmentgroupduringthe
beforeperiod. If therearelargedifferences,then transformations of the dependentvariablein (3) may affect the results.
For example, if the mean of the outcome variable is very
different in the treatmentand comparison groups, then (3)
could not be an appropriatemodel both in levels and logarithms(unlessat = 0). This problemoccursbecausenonlineartransformationsof the dependentvariableimply different
marginaleffects on the dependentvariable at different levels of the dependentvariable. Thus time could not have an
effect of the exact samemagnitudein bothtreatmentandcontrol groupsin both a linearand logarithmicspecification. In
this example, one may be able to determinewhethera linear
or logarithmictransformationis more appropriateby testing
whetherother variableschange the dependentvariablein a
linear or a logarithmicfashion. The same issue arises when
therightside of (3) is nonlinearor when maximumlikelihood
techniquesare used (e.g., see Madrian1994). In any case, it
is useful to examinethe size andsignificanceof1 and• for
an indicationof the comparabilityof the groups. If they are
both near 0, then possible transformationsof the dependent
variableor differentfunctional forms in likelihoods should
be of little importance.
In addition,examiningthe size and significanceof&1and
'l may revealotherproblemsof interpretation.If91 is large
in absolutevalue, it suggests thatperiod-to-periodchangesin
the dependentvariableare not unusualand furtherevidence
on its varianceover time might be warranted.If the effects
of omitted variables,trends in outcomes, mismeasurement,

<-----Page 6----->156

Journalof Business&Economic
Statistics,
April1995

and so forththatarecapturedby this termarelarge,it is more
likely that the effect varies substantiallyacross groups. A
large '1 may also be an indication that standarderrorsare
understateddue to the presenceof a groupeffect in the error
termfor the interactionof treatmentand time.
Although these last remarksare given as a rule of thumb
ratherthanan absoluteprinciple,the ideacanbe formalizedin
the following way. Supposethatwe arewilling to assumethat
a1 representsthe averageeffect of a changein an unobserved
explanatoryvariable that has a heterogeneousbut positive
effect on the outcome for all observations.Then a boundon
thetrueinteractionbetweentime andbeingafterthe treatment
is ao/p, wherep is the fractionof the afterpopulationthat is
in the treatmentgroup. Because this boundis decreasingin
the size of oa1,we are able to rule out interactionsof a smaller
magnitudethe smallerot is. A similarargumentcan be made
aboutat1
I shouldnote thatthe appropriateerrorstructurein (3) may
differ in repeatedcross-section and panel data. In repeated
cross-section data it is likely that 0iois uncorrelatedwith Eil
so that the averages in (4) are independent. In panel data,
correlationis likely, but an easy solution is to estimate (3)
in differences and in (4) calculate the varianceof pddusing
the sample varianceof the quantity (yio- Yil). In the case
of positively correlatedE's the varianceof the differenceis
smallerthanthe sum of the individualvariances.

4. EXTENSIONSOF DIFFERENCE-INDIFFERENCESMETHODS
To narrowthe focus of this article, I omit some research
designs thathave founduse in otherfields, such as the regression discontinuitydesign (Cook and Campbell 1979). The
mainideas of Section 3, however,areimbeddedin othercommonly used researchdesigns. This section describesseveral
extensions to the difference-in-differencesapproach.

4.1 Studies Without a Time Dimension
There are many ways that the variables in Equation(3)
can be relabeledwithout changingthe underlyingapproach.
The index t does not need to indicate time. Rather,it only
needs to indicate one group that was subject to a treatment
andanothergroupthatwas not. Forexample,Madrian(1994)
examinedthe effects of insurancecoverageon the probability
of moving between jobs. The hypothesis is that those with
both currentcoverage and a greaterdemand for insurance
(due to lack of coveragethrougha spouse or greaterdemand
for healthcare due to pregnancyor largefamily size) should
be less likely to move. Let t = 0 for someone with a low
demand for insurance, and t = 1 for someone with a high
demand. Similarly,let j = 0 for an uncoveredworker,and
j = 1 for a person currentlycovered. The treatmenteffect
is the interactionof being currentlycovered and having a
greaterdemandfor futureinsurance(t = 1,j = 1).
A word of caution is appropriatehere. When t does not
indicatebeing before or afteran event (often a suddenchange
in an explanatoryvariable),it may be moredifficultto assess
whether there would be an interactionbetween t = 1 and

j = 1 even withoutthetreatment.One wouldlike to be ableto
examineif the outcomemeasurefor the treatmentandcontrol
groups would change by the same amount in response to
differencesanalogousto those thatdefinethe treatmentbutin
the case in whichthetreatmentis notpresent.In thepreceding
example, one needs to considerif greaterinsurancedemand
as reflectedin no spousalcoverage,pregnancy,orlargefamily
size would have the same quantitativeeffect on the mobility
of those with and withouttheir own coverage even if health
insurancewere not an influence. In this situationit may also
be moredifficultor impossibleto findadditionalobservations
on analogousunits(timeperiods,states)to examineif in other
contexts the mobility of those with and without coverage
moves in parallel.Whenthe units aretime or states,one may
be able to select similar states or additionaltime periods to
examine this hypothesis.

4.2 Controls for IndividualCharacteristics
The incorporationof the influences of other variablesis
straightforwardin the regressionapproachof Equation(3).
If we havea vectorof characteristicsof the units understudy,
zi, we can include it as an additionalvector of explanatory
variables.Thus the regressionequation
Yi = aO+tad, t'dj + idj z
-I J
(5)
provides a simple way to adjust for observable differences
between the observationsin the differentgroups. Using this
equationmay also improvethe efficiency of the estimateof p
by reducingtheresidualvariance.I shouldnote that,as usual,
enforcinghomoscedasticityof the errorterm across groups
(even if it trulyholds)does notimproveasymptoticefficiency.
I should also note that one needs to enforce equality of
8 across groups; otherwise Equation(5) will not adjustfor
differences in these variables across groups. One can test
whetherthis restrictionholds using conventionalmethods. If
thevariableshavedifferenteffects withinthedifferentgroups,
it is unlikely that the regression adjustmentwill eliminate
these differences.A test of equalityof 8 across groupsmight
also detectomittedvariablesorfunctional-formmisspecifications thatwouldmakethe regressionadjustmentsinadequate.

4.3 TreatmentsThatAre Higher-OrderInteractions
In theexamplesso far,thetreatmentgrouphasbeendefined
by the interactionof two dummyvariables,usually a dummy
variablefor being in the treatmentgroup and one for being
afterthe time of the treatment.Situationsoften arisein which
the treatmentis defined by the interactionof more thantwo
variables.In this case, a design relying on this higherlevel of
interactionmay allow the researcherto remove main effects
and lower-levelinteractionseffects. More concretely,the researchermay believe thatthereare extratermsin (3) besides
time andstatein theUnitedStates,for example. It may be that
the treatmentgroupaffectsa certaindemographicgroupin the
stateandtime period. Thus a versionof (3) may be appropriate with a higher-orderinteractionbeing the key explanatory
variablewith the coefficient p. This approachis suitable if
the treatmentgroupdiffersfromthe comparisongroupalong

<-----Page 7----->in Economics
andQuasi-Experiments
Meyer:Natural
severaldimensions, andit may have the advantageof removing any trendsalong these otherdimensionsof the data.
The regressionequationfor this model is
jk? =
yik

+
o idt, + 'ld + ylek + 1dt
+ye:
"djk+
lk
djk+ jk, (6)
where the outcomey is now also indexedby k, k = 0, 1, and
d, = 1 if t = 1 and 0 otherwise; di = 1 ifj = 1 and 0
otherwise;ek = 1 if k = 1 and 0 otherwise;dt, ek, anddik are
the three possible interactionsof two factors (the first-order
interactions);anddik = lift = 1,j = 1, andk = 1 andOotherwise is the interactionof all threefactors(the second-order
interaction).dikis a dummyvariablefor being in the subset
of the experimentalgroupthatreceives the treatmentafterit
receives the treatment,andP is the effect of the treatmenton
the outcome.
Examples of such designs include that of Gruber(1994),
who examinedthe incidence of mandatedmaternitybenefits,
and Yelowitz (1994) who examinedthe effects of Medicaid
expansionson welfare participationand laborsupply. In the
workof Gruber(1994), thetreatedarethose womenof certain
ages (k = 1) in a certaingroupof states(j = 1) afterthe mandate (t = 1). The coefficienton this second-orderinteraction
is the key parameterof interest. Variablesto capturethe
main effects and first-orderinteractionsare also includedin
the estimationequations. Similarly,in the work of Yelowitz
(1994) the treatedare motherswith childrenof certainages
(k = 1) in certainstates (j = 1) afterextensionsof Medicaid
coverage (t = 1). Again, the coefficient on a second-order
interactionvariableis the key parameterof interest.This idea
can be extended to even higher-levelinteractions. It is importantto include the first-orderinteractionsin Equation(6)
when testing for the presence of the second-orderinteraction; otherwise the second-orderinteractioneffect would be
confounded with the omitted first-orderinteractions,likely
leading to biased estimates.

5. FURTHEREVIDENCEON COMPARABILITY
The use of the before and after design with an untreated
comparisongroup rests on comparabilityof the before and
after groups, at least after netting out a time mean common
to both the treatmentand comparisongroups. To examine
comparability,often supplementaryinformationis available.
Examples of supplementaryinformationinclude a clearly
specifiedhypothesisaboutthe likely differencesbetweenthe
before and after groups or additionalcontrolgroups.
5.1

Multiple Comparison Groups

The before and afterdesign with an untreatedcomparison
group can be strengthenedby the use of additionalcomparison groups. This design featureallows furtherexamination
of the / = 0 hypothesis in the absence of a treatment.Additional comparisongroupsreducethe importanceof biases
or random variation in a single comparison group. There
are some simple principlesto follow in choosing comparison
groups. The more similar the comparisongroup is to the
treatmentgroup the better. For a given degree of similarity

157

with the treatmentgroup,however,greaterdifferencesacross
comparisongroups are desirableif they are likely to lead to
differentbiases.
Last, the more comparisongroups the better. Examples
of studies that feature multiple comparisongroups include
that of Meyer (1989), who examined the effect of 17 increases in unemploymentinsurancebenefits on unemployment durationsand 16 analogous cases in which benefits
were unchanged. Similarly, Krueger(1990) examined the
effect of an increase in workers' compensationbenefits on
claim durationsandused two groupsof comparisonworkers
who were not subjectto the benefit increase.
Another approachmay be available if the researcherhas
knowledge abouthow the treatmentand comparisongroups
differ,say thatone grouphas a highermean value of a given,
possibly unmeasured,variablethataffects the outcome. One
can examine if groups that differ in the mean value of this
variablerespondto other factors (time, for example, in the
beforeand afterdesigns) similarly.This idea has been called
"controlby systematicvariation"(see Rosenbaum1987 for a
nice discussion). If the groupsdo respondsimilarly,it would
supportthe assumptionof no omitted interactionsand the
converseif they do not.
When a comparisongroup that would be expected to be
similarly affected by other factors cannot be identified,one
possible approachis to searchfor comparisongroupswhose
outcomes could be expected to bracketthe outcome for the
treatmentgroup. For example, using groups that might be
expected to have both largerand smaller responses to other
changesduringtherelevanttime periodcould providebounds
for the possible effects. If these bounds are narrow,the
method providesuseful informationabout the parameterof
interest.
In relatedwork, Rosenbaum(1987) emphasizedthat one
can formally test whethercomparisongroups are similar to
each other. This approachis likely to be most useful when
the assumptionsthat make one group a valid comparison
group imply that the other is valid also. Then a comparison of the two groupsprovides a test of these assumptions.
This comparisonof controlgroupscan be reinterpretedas the
economist's test of overidentifyingrestrictions. A comparison of two estimatesof P, based on a summarystatisticfrom
the same treatmentgroup but differentcomparisongroups,
wouldjust be a test of equalityof the summarystatisticfrom
the two comparisongroups.
Additionalcomparisongroups are sometimes called null
treatmentgroups. A null treatmentgroupis a grouplike the
treatmentgroup in time or geographythat does not receive
a treatment. The use of such groups to check assumptions
regardingthe unbiasednessor varianceof outcome measures
has been called "uniformitytrials"(see Margolin 1987).
5.2

Multiple Preintervention
Time Periods

or Postinterventiorn

A design feature that allows the examination of various
validity threatsis the use of data from several preintervention or postinterventiontime periods. For example, Meyer

<-----Page 8----->158

Journalof Business&Economic
Statistics,
April1995

(1992) studied the effect of a 27% increase in the New
York unemploymentinsurancebenefit that only applied to
above-average-incomeworkers.An analysis of two years of
quarterlydata makes it clear that there is strongseasonality
(omittedvariablesin termsof the validitythreats)in the outcome measures,which are the numberand length of claims.
This resultsuggests thatcomparingoutcomesfor the months
immediatelybefore and after the benefit increase would be
inappropriate.Additionaltime series observationsmay also
indicatethe importanceof groupeffects in the errorof equations such as (5) (misspecifiedvariances).
A second and underemphasizedadvantageof a long time
series for outcome measures is that they may allow the researcherto examine if the treatmentand controlgroupstend
to move in parallel-that is, go up or down together. In
the absence of interactionsbetween treatmentand other influences (omittedinteractions),parallelmovementwould be
expected. In the case of the minimumwage study described
previously,one could ask if the New Jersey and Pennsylvania fast-food employmentlevels tend to move together.One
could also examine if movementsof a given magnitudeare
more or less common thanthe standarderrorssuggest.

5.3 Other Ways to Examine Comparability
In thebeforeandaftercomparisondesigns, with or without
an untreatedgroup,it is useful to comparethe characteristics
of the units in the groups for indicationsof comparability.
If substantialdifferencesin mean characteristicsarepresent,
they should cause concern. Such differenceswould not necessarilyinvalidatethe resultsbecauseone maybe ableto control for these characteristics.In addition,group differences
in characteristicsmay accordwith or rejecthypothesesabout
likely differencesbetweentreatmentandcomparisongroups.
Similarly,in repeatedcross-section analyses the population
(or sample) sizes should be examinedbecause largechanges
in the size of the populationmay indicatechangesin the compositionof the groupsin ways notcompletelycapturedby observed characteristics.The directionof change, especially if
competinghypotheses imply directions,may be informative.
Last if assignmentto the treatmentandcomparisongroups
is defined by a measuredvariable,it may be possible to examine comparabilityin an additionalway. In the preceding
unemploymentinsuranceand workers'compensationexamples, the groups were defined by past earnings. One could
look for aneffect of earningson the outcomeof interestwithin
the high and low earningsgroups. If thereis no relationship,
thatsuggeststhatthe groupsaremorelikely to be comparable,
and the opposite is true if there is a strongrelationship.
6.
6.1

FURTHER TESTS OF THE HYPOTHESES
Multiple Treatment Groups

The before and afterdesign with an untreatedcomparison
groupis also strengthenedby the presenceof severaldistinct
groupsthataresubjectto the treatment.Especiallyuseful are
treatmentgroups in differentsettings such as differenttime
periods or states or treatmentgroupsreceiving treatmentsof

differentintensities. This design featurewas used by Meyer
et al. (1990, in press), who examinedthe same sets of statistics for workers'compensationbenefit increases in two different states. Differences in the intensity of the treatment
across differentgroups allow one to examine if the changes
in outcomesdifferacrosstreatmentlevels in the expecteddirection. Multipletreatmentgroupsmay also allow testing of
morerefinedhypothesesif the treatmentis expectedto have a
differentialimpacton the outcomesfor differentgroups. For
example, Cardand Krueger(1994) in their minimumwage
studydefinedadditionaltreatmentgroupswithinNew Jersey
definedby high, medium,andlow wages priorto the increase
in the minimum. The expectationis that the minimumwage
would have a largereffect in restaurantswith lower wages.

6.2 Other Tests
Anotherdesign featurethatstrengthensevidence of causal
effects is the later reversal of the initial treatment. For
example, a state law may be passed and then laterrepealed.
Curington(1994) examinedseveralchangesin workers'compensation benefits that increased the worker's reward for
lengtheningthe periodof receipt of temporarybenefitsrelative to permanentbenefits. He was also able to examine one
change that reversed the incentives, increasing permanent
benefitsrelativeto temporaryones, and saw if the effect on
the dependentvariablereversed. In a slightly differentvein,
Gruber(1994) examined a later federal mandateof maternity benefitsthatchangedsome of his earliertreatmentstates
(which had state mandates)into controls,and vice versa.
A final way of examining the appropriatenessof an approach (especially when no effects are found) is to examine
if the approachhas sufficientpower to detect and properly
measurethe effect of a knowncausalvariableon the outcome.
Margolin (1987) called this the use of a positive treatment
group.

7. SOURCESOF EXOGENOUSVARIATION
One of the themesfromthe examplesthatI have described
is thatgovernmentpolicies often createnaturaltreatmentand
comparisongroups.Frequently,this eventoccursbecauseour
federal system of governmentallows one state to change a
policy while othersdo not. The manycross-statedifferences
in policies and changes in these policies allow the examination of a wide range of questions.
An illustrativeexample comes from studies of the effects
of unemploymentinsuranceandworkers'compensationbenefits on the lengthof absencefrom work. These studieshave
typically used several sources of variationin benefitsgenerally in unspecifiedproportions.These sourcesinclude(a) the
variationdue to differencesin individuals'earningshistories
thatis often the sole determinantof benefitswithina stateat a
point in time, (b) differencesacross states in these schedules
thatrelate currentbenefitsto past earnings,and (c) changes
in these benefitschedules over time.
Given thatlaborsupplyis correlatedover time for an individual,(a) is unlikelytobe exogenous.In termsof the validity
threats,thereis selection on a variablehighly correlatedwith

<-----Page 9----->in Economics
andQuasi-Experiments
Meyer:Natural
the lagged dependentvariable.Because it is difficultto measure characteristicsof state programsand state labor markets that are importantfor the outcomes of interest, mean
differences across states incorporatedin (b) are unlikely to
be useful. Again, in terms of the validity threats,there are
likely importantomitted variables. This leaves interactions
between (a) and (b)-that is, how differentstates treat differences in earningshistory differently-and (c) as possible
sourcesof variation.Interactionsbetween(a) and(b) in addition to (c) are the sources of variationused by Meyer (1990)
and Anderson and Meyer (1994). Source (c) is likely to be
especially useful if one can examinesharpchangesin policies
that were unlikely to have been determinedby past values of
the outcomes of interest(so thatpolitical economy issues are
not important). It is also importantthat past values of outcomes could not have been affected by knowledge of future
policy changes. Conventionalstudies typically include all
threesources of variationin unknownproportionsanddo not
adequatelycontrol for the sources of endogeneity (i.e., the
selection mechanism or omitted variables) of the different
components. Recent naturalexperimentstudies have taken
the more convincing approachof examiningchanges in benefits, typically ones that affect some groupsbut not others.
Nevertheless,not every law changeis a good naturalexperiment. The dangerin using such variationis thatthe changes
may be drivenby political factorsassociatedwith outcomes.
Campbell (1969) and Cook and Tauchen(1982) provideda
good summaryof the argumentin the case of naturalexperiment approaches,and Besley and Case (1994) provided a
recent discussion. For example, a few high years of crime
due to unusualcircumstancesmay stimulatea crackdown.A
subsequentreductionin crime afterthe unusualyears should
not be taken to indicate an effective crackdownif a drop
would have been expected anyway.
The way to avoid thatpitfall is to know the circumstances
surroundingreforms or to more generally model the determinantsof policy changes. For example, Cook and Tauchen
(1982) examinedwhetherliquortaxes affect the incidenceof
heavy drinking. Because of a concernthatchanges in drinking habits might cause changes in taxes, they performeda
series of Grangerand Sims exogeneity tests to see if thereis
evidence of a causal link runningin this otherdirection.
Othersituationsfavorableto the use of naturalexperiment
approachesinclude changes in governmentpolicies that are
applicableto some groupsbut not others. Then, unless past
changes specific to that group motivatedthe policy change,
the groups not subjectto the policy change providecomparison groups. Additionally,data from before and afterlarge,
sharppolicy changes can often avoid the influenceof slowly
moving factors that determinepolitical decisions.
8.

IMPRECISE ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT
AND INSTRUMENTALVARIABLES

Governmentpolicy or other forces do not always create
simple treatmentand comparisongroupsbutmay insteadinfluence the likelihood thatan individualreceives a treatment.
In such a situation, a variablethat is correlatedwith the as-

159

signmentto treatmentbut that does not solely determinethe
assignmentmay be available. If this variableis also uncorrelatedwith the errorin the outcome equation,then in linear
andcertainnonlinearmodels the effects of the treatmentmay
be estimatedusing instrumentalvariables(IV).
An example of the imprecise assignmentto treatmentand
the use of IV comes from the Vietnam-eradraftlottery. The
lottery randomlyestablished priorityfor induction into the
military. Draft lottery numberscan be used as instruments
for veteranstatus when one is interestedin determiningthe
effect of military service on earnings later in life (Angrist
1990). A secondexampleis the workof Angristand Krueger
(1991), who used quarterof birthas an instrumentfor educational attainmentin earnings equations. Quarterof birth
is correlatedwith educationalattainmentbecause it affects
whethercompulsory school attendancelaws were binding.
The authorsalso providedsubstantialevidence that quarter
of birthdoes not have an effect on earnings except through
compulsoryschooling laws.
IV estimationalso may often be appliedto a modifiedversion of the earlierequations. Changes in state laws can be
thoughtof as generatinginstrumentsthatcan be used to identify causal effects. For example, in the workers' compensation study describedat length previously,one could include
as an explanatoryvariablethe benefit amount, b{, and then
use the appropriatedummy variable as an instrument. The
equationwould become
y = ao+ cid, + ao'd-+ 7rb, + z,38+ Ej,

(7)

and di would be the appropriateinstrumentfor the benefit
amount.The first-stageregressionin two-stage least squares
(2SLS) consists of regressing the benefit amount on the
dummyvariabledi andothercontrolvariables.The predicted
valuesfromthis regressionarethen substitutedfor the benefit
amountin the second stage of 2SLS. An advantageof the IV
approachin this example is that one directly estimates the
derivativeof y with respect to the benefit amount.

9. WHATPARAMETER
DO NATURAL
EXPERIMENTS
ESTIMATE?
A weaknessof naturalexperimentsis thattheirresultsmay
not be generalizablebeyondthe groupof individualsor firms
or the setting used in the study. The workers' compensation
example describedearlierestimatedthe effect of increasing
workers'compensationbenefitsover a particularrangefor a
group of high-wage workers.One might wonder if these results generalizeto all workers.Similarly,the minimumwage
studydescribedearlierestimatedthe effect of minimumwage
laws on employmentfor a group of four nationalchains of
fast-foodrestaurants.One might wonderif these resultsgeneralize to all low-wage employment.
This issue of externalvalidity arises when the treatment
has differenteffects on different observations. In terms of
the equations, / in (5) may vary over i and may interact
with zi. Interactionsbetween the treatmentand individual
characteristicshave been examined in some naturalexperiments. Forexample,Angrist(1990) andAngristandKrueger

<-----Page 10----->160

Journalof Business & EconomicStatistics,April1995

(1991) performedmost of theiranalysesseparatelyfor blacks
and whites. In most cases, however,researcherspermitlittle
or no variationin treatmenteffects.
Althoughthis problemcertainlylimits the generalizability
of naturalexperimentresults, many (or most) conventional
studies assume constant impacts across groups or constant
elasticities. Furthermore,in conventionalstudies one rarely
determineswhat parts of the variationin a key explanatory
variableare particularlyinfluential-that is, play the largest
roles in determining coefficient values. This variation is
rarelytheunweightedvariationin a samplebecausea multiple
regressioncoefficientis determinedby the residualvariation
afterotherexplanatoryvariablesareconditionedout. In conventionalstudies, typically all sources of variationare combined and treatedequally, even though some of the sources
may be endogenousor havedifferenteffects on the outcomes.
In naturalexperimentsone usually can point to the sourceof
the variationthat generatedthe results.

10. CONCLUSIONS
Policy change, governmentrandomization,or otherevents
may allow a researcherto obtainexogenous variationin key
explanatoryvariables. This is especially useful when there
is concernaboutomittedvariables,purposefulselection into
treatment,or otherthreatsto validity. Researchdesignsbased
on exogenous variationhave recently been used to analyze
a wide range of issues. Even when not conclusive, the simplicity of such designs often narrowsthe range of plausible
alternativeexplanations.
Of course, calling a source of variationa naturalexperimentdoes not makethatvariationexogenous. But the natural
experimentapproachemphasizes the importanceof understandingthe source of variationused to estimatekey parameters. In my view, this is the primarylesson of recentworkin
the naturalexperimentmold. If one cannot experimentally
control the variationone is using, one should understandits
source.
