<-----Page 1----->THE DETERMINANTS OF INTERFIRM TRUST: EVIDENCE FROM SUPPLIER
AUTOMAKER RELATIONSHIPS IN THE U.S., JAPAN, AND KOREA
ABSTRACT
The determinants of interfirm trust are examined in 453 supplier automaker relationships in the
U.S., Japan, and Korea. The findings indicate high supplier trust emerges when (1) suppliers
receive assistance from the automaker, (2) the automaker has a track record of maintaining a
continuing (repeated) exchange relationship with the supplier. Although there were some
differences across institutional environments, notably higher trust in Japan, the findings are robust
across the three institutional environments. Indeed, in a sample of U.S. suppliers that worked
with both U.S. and Japanese automakers in the United States, we found that Japanese automakers
were more effective than U.S. automakers at building trusting relations with U.S. suppliers.
Thus, firm level practices appear to be more important than the institutional environment in the
development of interfirm trust.
A central issue in the literature on strategic alliances and interfirm cooperation is how firms create
trust and control opportunism, particularly when the transactors have made investments in
transaction specific assets.
Under these conditions, trust has been described as an important antecedent to interorganizational
cooperation and economic efficiency (Sako, 1991; Smith, Carroll, and Ashford, 1995). In fact,
recent research suggests that trust in supplier buyer relations may be an important source of
competitive advantage because it: (1) lowers transaction costs and allows for greater flexibility to
respond to changing market conditions (Dore, 1983; Sako, 1991; Barney & Hansen, 1995; Dyer,
forthcoming), (2) facilitates investments in special purpose assets and technologies which enhance
productivity (Asanuma, 1989; Lorenz, 1988; Dyer, 1994), and (3) leads to superior information
sharing routines which improve coordination and joint efforts to minimize inefficiencies (Fruin,
1992; Clark & Fujimoto, 1991; Nishiguchi, 1994). Moreover, some scholars claim that national
economic efficiency is highly correlated with the existence of a high trust institutional environment
(North, 1990; Casson, 1991; Hill, 1995; Fukuyama, 1995). For example, Fukuyama (1995:7)
argues that the economic success of a nation, "as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by
the level of trust inherent in the society." The findings from these, and other, studies have
increased our attention on the important role of trust in economic exchanges.
A natural response to these studies has been to exhort companies to build trust with their trading
partners (Business Week, 1986, 1992) and to call for increased research on the role of trust in
coordinating economic activity (Smith, Carroll, and Ashford, 1995). However, before an explicit
strategy for developing trust can be developed, or considered feasible, the determinants of trust
must be identified. Despite considerable academic and managerial interest in trust between trading
partners, to date there has been little empirical research on the antecedents or determinants of
interorganizational trust (i.e. between supplier buyer). Further, there has been little research on
whether the determinants of trust differ in different institutional (i.e. country) environments.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of supplier trust in a sample of
supplier/automaker relationships in the United States, Japan, and Korea. Given the recent attention
on the importance of trust in exchange relationships, an examination of the determinants of trust is,
by itself, a valuable undertaking. However, due to the globalization of industries and a dramatic
increase in international joint ventures, a study of the determinants of trust in different institutional
environments is particularly valuable. Such a study is useful because it allows for an examination
of those factors that are important determinants of trust both within, as well as across, countries.

<-----Page 2----->THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES
Defining Trust
Williamson (1993:453) has noted that "trust is a term with many meanings." Indeed, various
scholars have offered different definitions of types of trust, including goodwill or relational trust
(Sako, 1991; Sabel, 1993; Hesterley et al, 1995), process based trust (Zucker, 1986; Zaheer &
Venkatraman, 1995), institutional trust (Arrow, 1974; Zucker, 1986), competence trust (Sako,
1991), and calculative or contractual trust (Sako, 1991; Williamson, 1993). Among organizational
scholars, trust has received attention as a mechanism of organizational control, and more
specifically as an alternative to price, contracts, and authority (Ouchi, 1980; Bradach & Eccles,
1989; Powell, 1990). In this study we consider dyadic trust between a supplier and its customer.
We define trust as mutual confidence that no party to an exchange will exploit another's
vulnerabilities (Dore, 1983; Sako, 1991; Sabel, 1993; Barney & Hansen, 1995). This suggests
that parties to an exchange: (1) make good faith efforts to behave in accordance with prior
commitments, (2) make adjustments as market conditions change in ways perceived as "fair" by
the exchange partners, and (3) do not take excessive advantage of another even when the
opportunity is available. In many respects, opportunism may be viewed as the opposite of trust.
A firm's actions are opportunistic to the extent that it does not live up to prior commitments and
takes advantage of another's exchange vulnerabilities. Our definition of trust is similar to the
"goodwill trust" description given by Sako (1991) and the "trust" definition offered by Sabel
(1993) and Barney & Hansen (1995). Trust, as defined here, is not based upon contracts or third
party sanctions but rather is based on non contractual mechanisms.
Trust is generally considered to be of most economic value to transactors when it is based on noncontractual, rather than contractual mechanisms. The rationale for the economic value of non
contractual trust is straightforward: trust eliminates the need for formal contracts, which are costly
to write, monitor and enforce (Hill, 1995; Barney & Hansen, 1995). Thus, trust reduces
transaction costs because transactors engage in self monitoring which reduces the need for costly
formal third party monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.
The Determinants of Trust
A firm may trust trading partners to refuse to break confidences and exploit vulnerabilities for a
variety of reasons. However, typically we would expect trading partners to behave in a
trustworthy manner because failure to do so would result in self imposed moral sanctions (Firth,
1951; Mauss, 1967; Macauley, 1963; Hill, 1990), social sanctions (Sahlins, 1972; Dore, 1983;
Grannovetter, 1985; Powell, 1987) or economic sanctions (Klein, 1980; Williamson, 1983/1993).
Various scholars have observed that some individuals derive substantial "utility" from behaving in
ways that they perceive to be "moral" or "ethical" (Firth, 1951; Mauss, 1967; Donaldson, 1990).
Indeed, studies of exchange in both primitive and modern societies indicate that many individuals
do not behave opportunistically because they are afraid of the "moral" sanctions that could be
imposed by a powerful deity or supernatural force, or they embrace the value of being "ethical"
(Mauss, 1967; Macauley, 1963; Hill, 1990; Barney & Hanson, 1995). As Hill (1990:502) argues,
"Even if the asset specificity is high, there will be actors who, perhaps for reasons of principle,
will never be the first to act opportunistically. Rather they will choose to cooperate and trust
others." Of course, the difficulty for transactors is knowing ex ante which potential trading
partners are the honorable "type."
Alternatively, if a transaction is embedded within a broader reciprocal social relationship, then
transactors may rely on social sanctions to protect their interests. Various types of social sanctions

<-----Page 3----->may control opportunism, including: withdrawal of love, respect, prestige, and/or (worst of all)
banishment from the social community (Light, 1972; Smith, 1983; Grannovetter, 1985; Ellickson,
1991). Thus, a firm that takes unfair advantage of a trading partner may find any of a number of
sanctions imposed by other members of the social network.
Finally, transactors may be trustworthy (refuse to be opportunistic) due to economic sanctions that
can be imposed on them by trading partners or other members of the economic network (economic
sanctions have received the greatest attention in the law and economics literature; See Macneil,
1978; Klein, 1980; Williamson 1983; Kronman, 1985; Klein & Kenny, 1989). For example,
trading partners may make financial or investment arrangements (stock swaps, equity participation)
which are purposefully designed to align the economic fortunes of trading partners. These types of
arrangements are often referred to as an exchange of hostages.
In summary, a variety of mechanisms may persuade transactors to behave in a trustworthy fashion
in trading relationships. The issue of interest here is how can we predict when high trust relations
will emerge in supplier buyer exchanges. We offer the following hypotheses regarding the
determinants of interorganizational trust in the automotive industry.
Assistance
The importance of gift exchange in creating trust and reciprocity in exchange relationships has been
long argued by a distinguished line of anthropologists and sociologists (Malinowski, 1922; Mauss,
1967; Gouldner, 1963). Gouldner (1963) suggests that a norm of reciprocity begins with a
starting mechanism which may take the form of a gift or other acts of generosity. More recently
Camerer (1988) has argued that even small, inefficient (with little practical value) gifts often serve
as important and meaningful economic signals and social symbols.
The rationale behind the trust creating value of gift giving is that when an exchange partner offers a
"free" gift it serves as a symbol of goodwill and benevolence. Such a gift suggests that the giving
party is genuinely concerned with the well being of the receiving party. Also, the gift may be
viewed as a signal that the giving party does not have opportunistic intent (is the "honest type") and
feels benevolent towards the receiving party. Benevolence is the perception of a positive
orientation of the trustee toward the trustor and has been hypothesized to be positively associated
with trust (Larzelere & Huston, 1980; Mayer et al, 1995). In supplier buyer relationships, when
buyers offer "free assistance" to the supplier (i.e. if assistance is not fully costed), suppliers are
likely to interpret such actions as a manifestation of commitment and benevolence by the buyer,
and may be a basis for 'goodwill trust' (Sako, 1992).

Hypothesis 1: The greater the assistance provided by the buyer to the supplier, the greater the
supplier's trust in the buyer.
Length of Relationship
Various scholars have suggested that trust is a valuable asset which takes time to develop and can
only be built slowly over time (Arrow, 1974; Sako, 1992). Related to this view is the notion that
social knowledge, or knowledge gained through long term interactions, may be the basis for trust
by allowing economic actors to understand and predict others' patterns of behavior (Tolbert, 1988;
Sohn, 1994). For example, Sohn (1994) found that in-depth social and cultural knowledge
facilitates coordination of transactions by making a potential partners' behavior both
understandable and predictable. Moreover, as social knowledge between transactors increases,
information asymmetries decrease, thereby reducing behavioral uncertainty. Higher levels of trust

<-----Page 4----->are believed to develop when information asymmetries are low (transaction conditions approximate
perfect information) and there is less behavioral uncertainty (high predictability of behavior).
Further, acquiring social knowledge through long term interactions provides insights into the
"moral character" of trading partners, thereby allowing transactors to better screen for "honest"
partners (Hill, 1990; Barney & Hansen, 1995).
Finally, when transactors engage in long term exchange relationships they develop a history
together. The past history of interactions of transactors is extremely important in developing
personal and social ties (i.e. the potential to use social sanctions to discourage opportunism). Most
of us recognize that we are less likely to take advantage of those with whom we've had long and
stable past interactions (e.g., family members, friends, etc.). We typically refuse to behave
opportunistically towards these individuals because they can impose real social sanctions on us. In
these situations, a "social memory" is created and transactors can achieve "serial equity"
(equity/reciprocity over a longer period of time) rather than requiring immediate or "spot equity"
(Ouchi 1984). Thus, we would expect higher levels of trust in exchange relationships where the
transactors have a longer history of interacting.
Hypothesis 2: The longer the duration since the supplier and buyer first began doing business
together, the higher the supplier's trust in the buyer.
Continuity of Relationship
In addition to length of relationship, continuity of the supplier buyer relationship may contribute to
the development of interorganizational trust. It is possible for trading partners to have had a long
term relationship (i.e. many years have passed since the initial transaction) and yet the relationship
may not have been continuous in the sense that suppliers continue to "re win" the same business
year after year. For example, some U.S. suppliers reported that they began selling parts to a
particular automaker 50 years ago. But there have been occasions when they have lost the part
business to competitors. In game theory parlance, the repeated game of exchange has been
broken. In other instances, a supplier's relationship with the automaker is a repeated game in the
sense that the supplier continues to "re win" the "contract" year after year. Thus, there is a high
degree of continuity in the relationship. Interfirm trust is built incrementally as firms repeatedly
interact (Gulati, 1995).
The logic for how repeated games result in more cooperative behavior is well documented in the
game theory literature (Axelrod, 1984; Fudenberg and Maskin, 1986; Parkhe, 1993). We would
predict that supplier trust would emerge under conditions of repeated exchange due to buyer
purchasing routines that are predictable and consistent and which do not switch (perhaps
opportunistically) business to competitors (Boyle & Bonacich, 1970; Butler, 1991). Repeated
exchange is particularly important to the development of supplier trust in situations where suppliers
have invested in transaction specific investments. Under these conditions, a buyer's willingness to
stay with the same supplier is likely to be interpreted by the supplier as a manifestation of
commitment and trustworthiness. Thus, we would expect supplier trust to be higher when the
buyer has a history of continuous, repeated exchange with the supplier.

<-----Page 5----->Hypothesis 3: Supplier trust is higher when the buyer has a track record of continuous repeated
exchange with the supplier
Face to Face Communication
Sociologists have frequently argued that proximity and face to face interaction are likely to lead to
the development of positive feelings of attraction (Lorenz, 1988; Argyle, 1991). Further,
cooperation and trust between individuals has been found to emerge in laboratory settings when
individuals can see and talk to each other and engage in social interaction (Wichman, 1972 reported
in Argyle, 1991). Face to face communication has been described as having a high knowledge
carrying capacity because it presents immediate feedback opportunities and makes use of both
visual and audio channels of communication (Daft & Lengl, 1986). Thus, face to face contact is
considered useful for developing trust because it offers more cues for interpreting a trading
partner's behavior and motivations. Moreover, face to face contact is viewed as an effective means
of developing personal ties, thereby increasing the efficacy of social sanctions. From an economic
perspective, previous studies have suggested that face to face contact leads to the development of
interfirm cooperation and trust by increasing behavioral transparency and reducing information
asymmetry (Heide & Miner, 1992; Sako, 1991). Thus, face to face communication would be
expected increase supplier buyer trust by: (1) developing personal ties, thereby increasing the
efficacy of social sanctions, (2) providing superior information to assist transactors in detecting or
identifying untrustworthy trading partners. Thus, we would expect that as the frequency of face to
face contact between transactors increases, so does interorganizational trust.
Hypothesis 4: The greater the face to face interaction between the supplier and buyer, the higher
the level of supplier trust in the buyer
Stock Ownership
Klein (1980) and Williamson (1983) suggest that one way to foster trust and prevent opportunism
is through the exchange of hostages. In particular, Klein (1980:358) argues that opportunism can
be controlled by having the potential cheater put up a "forfeitable-at-will collateral bond equal to the
discounted value of the premium stream." For example, "in the case of a franchising contract the
franchisee may be required to make an initial lump sum payment to the franchiser, thereby largely
shifting the potential threatened breach from the franchisee ('free riding' on a common trademark
by supplying lower quality service) to the franchiser (terminating or threatening to terminate the
franchisee without cause and purchasing the franchisee investment at a discounted price). The
initial lump sum is equivalent to a collateral bond forfeitable at the will of the franchiser" (Klein &
Kenny, 1989:41). Other financial hostages, which diminish in value if a transactor is
opportunistic, include stock swaps or equity participation in a trading partner (Pisano, 1989; Dyer
& Ouchi, 1993; Bolton et al, 1994). We argue, as has Pisano (1989) and Bolten et al (1994), that
partial equity ownership constitutes one visible and highly appropriate collateral bond which
reduces opportunism by aligning the incentives of each partner. The fact that the value of the
equity will decrease in value if a party is opportunistic provides an incentive for trading partners to
behave in a less opportunistic, or more trustworthy, fashion. Thus, we would expect equity
ownership to be positively associated with interorganizational trust.

<-----Page 6----->Hypothesis 5: The greater the buyer's ownership of supplier stock, the higher the level of supplier
trust in the buyer.
Research Setting
The auto industry in the U.S., Japan, and Korea was chosen as the research setting to examine the
determinants of trust in supplier buyer relationships. This research setting was an unusually good
test site for two reasons. First, it was important to study a set of transaction relationships in which
trust might be important and valuable. For example, many researchers have argued that risk, or
having something invested, is requisite to trust. The need for trust only arises in a risky situation
(Deutsch, 1958; Mayer et al, 1995). The automobile is a complex product with thousands of
components that must work together as a system. Components are often tailored to specific
models and as a result suppliers must make automaker specific investments (Nishiguchi, 1994;
Dyer, 1994). Since these investments are not easily re-deployable, suppliers are at risk if
automakers choose to behave opportunistically. Furthermore, the auto industry is characterized by
a high degree of market uncertainty (Pine, 1993), which also increases the risks associated with
transacting (Lorenz, 1988). Supplier trust is of particular importance since suppliers make
customer specific investments that place them at risk and automakers are in a stronger relative
power position.
Second, the automotive industry is a large and important industry in the U.S., Japan, and Korea.
Studying supplier buyer relationships in the same industry across different institutional
environments allows for some control of extraneous variation, thereby allowing a focus on the
impact of the institutional environment. Studying the determinants of trust in different institutional
environments is valuable because numerous scholars have argued that national culture can attenuate
opportunism by fostering trust and cooperation. For example, the U.S. is typically considered a
low trust environment whereas Japan is often presented as a model environment for fostering trust
and cooperation (Ouchi, 1981; Shane, 1994; Hill, 1995). Korea, is culturally more similar to
Japan than the U.S., but its management practices have been influenced by both the U.S. and
Japan (Dubinsky et al, 1994; Hamilton & Biggart, 1988). By examining supplier buyer
relationships in three countries, we can determine which factors influence trust across all countries,
as well as which are country specific.
Sample and Data Collection
The sample consisted of three U.S. (General Motors, Ford, Chrysler), two Japanese (Toyota,
Nissan), and three Korean (Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia) automakers and a sample of their suppliers.
The authors visited each company's purchasing department and asked the department manager to
select a representative sample of suppliers which included both partners (i.e. keiretsu/chaebol
suppliers) and non partner (i.e. independent) suppliers. We interviewed a total of 30 purchasing
managers at the eight automakers' purchasing departments to obtain feedback on the
appropriateness, completeness, and clarity of the questionnaire, and to gain a better understanding
of the issues arising in automaker supplier relations.
We also interviewed sales and engineering vice presidents at 70 suppliers (30 U.S., 20 Japanese,
20 Korean), during which the survey was developed and pre-tested. Most importantly, the
interviews helped us to gain a better understanding of the industry and the nature of the supplier
automaker relationship. To minimize key informant bias and follow the general recommendation to
use the most knowledgeable informant (Kumar et al, 1993), we asked the purchasing managers at
each automaker to identify the supplier executive who was most responsible for managing the day
to day relationship. This person was typically the supplier's sales vice president, sales account
manager, or in some cases, the president. The final survey was then sent to the key supplier
informant identified by the automaker. Key informants had been employed at their respective

<-----Page 7----->organizations for an average of 16 years and thus had a long history of working with the
automaker. Usable responses were obtained from 135 U.S. (66% response rate), 101 Japanese
(68% response rate) and 217 Korean (55% response rate) suppliers. The data collection was done
between 1992 and 1994. The U.S. and Japanese data were collected in 1992, reflecting data for
1991, and the Korean data were collected in 1994, reflecting data for 1993. We do not believe this
will bias the results since our analysis focuses on rather stable measures (i.e. length of
relationship, stock ownership, trust) which Korean suppliers indicated had not changed in any
significant ways since 1992.
Operational Measures
Recall that the survey was administered to the suppliers. Therefore, the measures reflect the
perceptions of the suppliers regarding the supplier automaker relationship. However, during our
interviews with the purchasing managers of the automakers we discovered that both the supplier
and automaker perceptions regarding the relationship were very similar in specific cases we
discussed. There were no instances where the perceptions of suppliers and automakers were
dramatically different. Our anecdotal findings are similar to those of Anderson and Narus (1990)
who found that suppliers' and buyers' perceptions of relational governance were quite consistent.
Trust
Consistent with previous studies we operationalized trust using multiple scale items designed to
measure the extent to which the supplier trusted the automaker not to behave opportunistically
(Anderson & Narus, 1990; Heide & John, 1990; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). Trust (TRUST)
was operationalized as the sum of the following variables. The extent to which the supplier trusts
the manufacturer to treat the supplier fairly. The extent to which the automaker has a reputation for
trustworthiness (following through on promises and commitments) in the general supplier
community.. If given the chance, the extent to which the supplier perceives that the automaker will
take unfair advantage of the supplier (reverse scored). Our trust construct includes key elements of
our definition of trust, including fair dealing, a reputation of following through on promises and
commitments, and a willingness to forego opportunism even when the chance is available. Each
scale item was measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Not at all, 7=To a very great extent).
Automaker Assistance to the Supplier
Our interviews with suppliers and automakers prompted us to classify assistance (ASSISTANCE)
into three types: assistance with the supplier's product quality, assistance with cost cutting efforts,
and assistance with inventory management. The degree of assistance offered by the automaker to
the supplier was measured through three items. The extent to which the automaker provides
assistance to help the supplier improve product quality.. The extent to which the automaker
provides assistance to help the supplier reduce manufacturing costs.. The extent to which the
automaker provides assistance to help the supplier improve inventory management/delivery. A 7point Likert scale was used to indicate the degree to which the supplier felt that these three types of
assistance were provided by the automaker. The total amount of assistance was the sum of the
three respective sub measures.

<-----Page 8----->Length of the Relationship
This measure (LENGTH) was operationalized as the number of years since the supplier first began
selling products to the automaker. This measure represents the length of the relationship, rather
than the intensity of the relationship, which is captured by other measures.
Continuity of the Relationship
Continuity of relationship (CONTINUITY) was operationalized as the percentage of time the
supplier's business has been renewed when there is a model change. In the automotive industry,
the model change is a natural time for buyers to reevaluate suppliers and make a change if deemed
appropriate. Suppliers who have a history of "re winning" the business at the model change would
be expected to have greater continuity in their relationship with the automakers when compared
with suppliers with a low "re win" percentage.
Face-to-Face Communication
This measure is operationalized as the annual "man days" that the supplier automaker spent in faceto-face contact during the year the data were gathered. This measure (FACE) includes face to face
contact between supplier sales and engineering personnel and automaker purchasing and
engineering personnel. Days of contact was calculated by having the key informants identify the
number of sales people that worked directly with the particular automaker. Then, s/he indicated the
average number of days per week that the typical salesperson would spend having a face to face
meeting with automaker personnel. Key informants provided the same information for engineers.
Thus, the measure consists of face to face communication that occurs between sales and
purchasing employees, as well as between engineers from the two respective organizations. The
assumption behind this measure is that as the number of days of face to face contact increases, so
does trust.
Stock Ownership
Both the automakers and suppliers provided data on the percent of supplier stock owned by the
automaker. However, this percentage was not directly used in the analysis because out of the 453
suppliers surveyed, less than 15 percent of the suppliers had their stock owned by the automakers.
Therefore, treating the variable stock ownership (STOCK) as a normally distributed independent
variable was unreasonable. Instead, we coded stock ownership as a dummy variable as either
having stock ownership or not having stock ownership. It should also be noted that all suppliers
in our sample were legally separate entities. In no case did the automaker own more than 50
percent of a supplier's stock.

<-----Page 9----->The Model
The following linear regression model was run in order to test the hypotheses:
Model 1: TRUST = a + b1ASSISTANCE + b2LENGTH + b3CONTINUITY + b4FACE +
b5STOCK.
A linear regression model was used because there was no reason to assume a non linear
relationship among the variables. The use of a linear model was later justified by an examination of
the residual distribution, which was homoskedastic and indicated no problems with serial
correlation. We also ran a second model, adding dummy country variables, to control for country
specific effects.

Model 2: TRUST = a + b1ASSISTANCE + b2LENGTH + b3CONTINUITY + b4FACE +
b5STOCK + b6 JAPANDUM+ b7 KOREADUM.
We acknowledge that the direction of causality between trust and the independent variables
LENGTH, CONTINUITY, and FACE is open to debate. For example, one can argue that high
trust leads to long term, continuous relationships and face to face contact rather than vice versa. We
have offered theoretical arguments which explain why these particular independent variables may
lead to high trust. However, we would expect some degree of reciprocal causality with these
variables in effect, a virtuous circle where the independent variables both influence, and are
influenced by, trust.
Results
The simple descriptive statistics shown in Table 1 indicate that supplier trust is significantly higher
in Japan than in Korea or the United States which have similar levels of supplier trust. Automaker
assistance to suppliers is highest in Korea and Japan, with U.S. automakers offering significantly
less assistance to suppliers. The high degree of automaker assistance in the Korean sample may be
reflective of the immaturity of Korean automobile suppliers, who still need large amounts of
assistance from the automaker in order to meet the automakers' minimum quality standards. The
degree of assistance in Japan is high, despite the strong capability of Japanese suppliers. In the
U.S., the degree of assistance is still rather low, perhaps because U.S. automakers and their
suppliers have traditionally maintained arms length relationships.
The length of the supplier automaker relationship is highest in Japan (41.4 years), followed by the
U.S. (32.6 years) and Korea (12.4 years). We would expect this result given the long history of
the automobile industry in the two former countries compared to that of Korea where the industry
is less than 30 years old. There is much greater continuity in the supplier automaker relationship in
Japan than in the U.S. or Korea. Japanese suppliers re win the "contract" over 90 percent of the
time at a model change while U.S. and Korean suppliers re win the contract approximately 78
percent of the time. These findings are consistent with previous studies which have suggested that
Japanese automakers do not switch suppliers nearly as often as do U.S. automakers (Helper,
1991; Dyer & Ouchi, 1993). Our data also indicate that there is more face to face communication
between suppliers and automakers in Japan than in the U.S. or Korea. We conjecture that face to
face contact among Japanese automotive transactors may be facilitated by the physical proximity of
suppliers and automakers in Japan.
Finally, Japanese automakers are most likely to hold minority stock ownership positions in
suppliers. Korean automakers rarely held stock in suppliers and in the U.S. sample only one
supplier was partially owned by an automaker.

<-----Page 10----->Table 2 presents the pooled sample correlation matrix for the dependent and independent variables.
An examination of Table 2 indicates that there are no substantial multicollinearity problems: all of
the 10 pairwise correlations between the independent variables are less than 0.33, with only one
correlation being greater than 0.30.
The regression results for the pooled sample are presented in Model 1 within Table 3. The results
show that our model was reasonably effective at predicting supplier trust as demonstrated by an R
of 0.268, which was significant at the p<.001 level.
Three of the five variables were found to have a significant positive effect (p<.001 level) on
supplier trust including: automaker assistance to the supplier, length of relationship, and continuity
of relationship. The relationship between stock ownership and trust was positive, as predicted, but
only significant at the p<.10 level. Surprisingly, total face to face communication was not useful
as a predictor of supplier trust.
The results from model 2, which includes the country dummy variables, are slightly different from
the results in model 1. First, the ASSISTANCE and CONTINUITY variables are significant in
model 2 just as they were in model 1. Thus, these variables are robust explanatory variables
across the three institutional environments. However, in model 2, LENGTH was found to be
insignificant and STOCK was not only insignificant, but the sign was negative rather than positive.
The differences between model 1 and model 2 can be attributed, of course, to country effects
which were not captured in model 1, as well as multicollinearity problems between the LENGTH
and STOCK variables and the country variables. More specifically, length of relationship was
positive and significant in model 1 largely because Japanese transaction relationships were long
term and high trust while Korean transaction relationships were relatively short term (due to the
immaturity of the industry) and low trust. Similarly, stock ownership was common in Japan
where transactors exhibited high trust, but rare in the U.S. where supplier automaker relationships
were relatively lower trust.
After controlling for country effects, neither the LENGTH or STOCK variables were significant
explanatory factors. As might be expected, the Japanese dummy was significant (p<.001), as was
the Korean dummy (p<.10), which suggests that the institutional environment plays an important
role in the production of trust in supplier automaker relationships.
In summary, from Table 3 we may conclude the following:
(1) Automaker assistance to the supplier is positively associated with supplier trust
in the automaker. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported.
(2) Although the length of the supplier automaker relationship appeared to have a
significant positive effect on supplier trust in the pooled sample, length of
relationship was found to be positive, but insignificant, after controlling for the
institutional environment. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is not supported.
(3) Continuity in the supplier automaker relationship (i.e., history of re winning
the contract) had a significant positive effect on supplier trust. Thus, Hypothesis 3
is supported. This variable (CONTINUITY), as well as ASSISTANCE are the two
most significant and robust predictors of trust in terms of the significance level at
which the hypotheses are accepted. The CONTINUITY variable is similar to the
ASSISTANCE variable in that revealed actions or behaviors appear to be important
in forging a trusting supplier relationship.

<-----Page 11----->(4) Face to face communication did not have an effect on trust. We did not find
support for Hypothesis 4 which proposed that greater face to face interaction would
lead to higher trust.
(5) After controlling for the institutional environment, stock ownership was found
to have an insignificant but negative, rather than positive, relationship with trust.
Thus, we did not find support for Hypothesis 5 which predicted that stock
ownership would be positively associated with supplier trust.

Individual Country Results
An important reason for doing this research with samples from different countries was to examine
how the determinants of trust may differ across countries. Previous research suggests that trust
between trading partners will vary not only with the attributes of the transaction, but also will vary
due to differences in societal culture, politics, networks, and business norms in the institutional
environment in which the transaction is embedded (Granovetter, 1985; Hill, 1995). Consequently,
we wanted to understand the extent to which there were important differences across national
boundaries. Let us briefly comment on country specific differences in our sample.
Supplier trust was universally high in Japan and there was very low variance on the trust measures
as well as many of the independent variables (See Table 1). These findings offer empirical support
for Dore's (1983) observation that "moralized trading relationships of mutual goodwill" generally
pervade Japanese transaction relationships, that trust is somehow a byproduct of the Japanese
institutional environment. Of the variables in our model, the most important determinant of
supplier trust in Japan was assistance from the automaker to supplier. Length of relationship
followed assistance as the second most important explanatory variable in the Japanese sample.
Interestingly, continuity of relationship was a less important explanatory variable in Japan than in
Korea or the U.S. It is worth noting, however, that the "re win" percentage was universally high
in Japan with extremely low variance. Thus, it was not as useful at predicting supplier trust.
However, this does not necessarily mean that it was not important in developing trust, but rather
that it was not as useful in discriminating between higher and lower levels of supplier trust.
Finally, we were surprised to find that stock ownership had a negative, though not significant,
effect on trust in the Japanese sample. In Japan, stock ownership has been described as an
important symbol of a relationship (Gerlach, 1987,1992). One interpretation of this finding is that
stock ownership has continued for such a long time in Japan that it has lost its significance as a
governance mechanism and thus doesn't affect "trust" anymore. Another interpretation is that
stock ownership is simply not an important determinant of supplier trust in Japanese supplier
automaker relations. Lincoln et al (1993:4) have argued that in Japan firms "purchase shares in
suppliers to increase their control over pricing and production" and that they dispatch personnel to
monitor their investment. Although these practices may result in cooperative interfirm behavior,
they do not necessarily result in high trust as we have defined trust in this study.
The most important determinant of trust in Korea was assistance from the automaker to the
supplier. Continuity of relationship followed assistance as the second most significant explanatory
variable in the Korean sample. "Re win" rates, and trust, were generally lower in Korea than
Japan with greater variance on both variables. Length of relationship and face to face contact were
found to be unimportant as predictors of trust in Korea. Interestingly, like Japan, stock ownership
was not significant (and slightly negative) in the Korean sample. Consistent with Lincoln et al
(1993), some Korean suppliers indicated that they thought the automaker used their stock
ownership position to exert control over the supplier. If true, this may explain why stock
ownership was not correlated with trust in either Korea or Japan.

<-----Page 12----->Finally, in the United States continuity of relationship was the only variable significantly correlated
with trust. The relationship between automaker assistance and trust was positive, but not
significant. One plausible explanation for this finding (offered by suppliers we interviewed) is that
U.S. automakers have only recently been offering assistance to suppliers. As U.S. automakers
provide increased assistance to suppliers, supplier trust may increase. Interestingly, the
relationship between face to face contact and trust was slightly negative in the U.S. sample. Some
U.S. suppliers claimed that they spent a considerable amount of their face to face interactions with
U.S. automakers on unproductive activities, such as negotiating contracts and assigning blame for
problems. This may explain the lack of a relationship between face to face contact and trust. U.S.
suppliers also offered a possible explanation for the lack of a relationship between length of
relationship and trust. Suppliers claimed that length of relationship did not necessarily have a
bearing on trust. Indeed, some suppliers suggested that the longer they had worked with a
particular automaker, the more time they had to learn that the automaker was not to be trusted.
Increases in time and experience with a particular trading partner may only mean that one can trust
one's own judgments about an uncertain situation better. Finally, stock ownership was not a
significant explanatory variable because, except in the case of one supplier, U.S. automakers did
not hold stock in any suppliers. U.S. automaker executives claimed that they did not want to be
tied to particular suppliers and thus had chosen not to purchase stock in suppliers. Similarly,
suppliers reported that they wanted to maintain their independence and autonomy from particular
automakers and thus have resisted automakers attempting to exert control through stock
ownership. Thus, the U.S. institutional environment appeared to play a role in constraining the
automotive firms' ability to use stock ownership as a means for establishing interfirm ties.

DISCUSSION
As reported in Table 1, we found significant differences in levels of supplier trust by country. The
differences in levels of trust across countries raises an important issue, notably, how important is
the institutional environment in allowing for, or fostering, interfirm trust (cooperative/trustworthy
behavior)? One view is that the institutional environment is critical for the development of trust
between supplier and buyer. According to this commonly accepted view, trust is a by product of
norms, embedded in social networks, and rarely brought about through rational instrumental
means (Grannovetter, 1985; See Sabel, 1993 for a discussion). If true, Japanese transactors
should only be able to develop high levels of trust with other Japanese transactors embedded
within the same social and economic network. A differing view argues that the ability to create
trusting supplier relations is a firm specific capability (perhaps fostered by a supportive cultural
environment) that is transferable across national and cultural boundaries.
To test whether or not trusting supplier relations can be purposefully created across national
boundaries, we surveyed a small sample of U.S. suppliers who worked with both U.S.
automakers and Japanese automaker "transplants" in the United States.
By surveying U.S. suppliers selling the same component to both U.S. and Japanese automakers
within the United States, we are able to control for cultural and component (technical) differences
that might influence interfirm trust. The sample consisted of only U.S. suppliers with at least three
years experience and five percent of their total sales to Japanese automakers. This was done to
exclude U.S. suppliers without significant experience working with Japanese automakers. These
20 suppliers were randomly selected from the 135 U.S. supplier sample. These suppliers were
then interviewed and surveyed regarding their relationship with both U.S. and Japanese
automakers.
Table 4 provides a summary of the sample means (for the sample of U.S. suppliers selling to both
Japanese and U.S. automakers) for a number of the independent and dependent (trust) variables

<-----Page 13----->used in this study. The results indicate that Japanese automakers are more effective than U.S.
automakers at building trusting relations with U.S. suppliers. These data suggest that perhaps
trust can be developed through rational instrumental means.
The question of how Japanese automakers were able to quickly develop trusting relationships with
U.S. suppliers is an important one. An examination of these results in light of our hypotheses
provides further insights into the determinants of interorganizational trust. First, U.S. suppliers'
relationships with Japanese automakers were only of short duration, 6 years versus 22 years with
U.S. automakers. Clearly a long term relationship is not a prerequisite for high trust.
Furthermore, given the short term nature of the relationships, there was not enough history to
accurately assess the "re win" rates of U.S. suppliers with Japanese automakers. However, in five
cases where suppliers were faced with a model change, suppliers reported re -winning the business
in each case. Moreover, our interviews with U.S. suppliers revealed that they believed that they
would re win their business at the model change because: (1) Japanese automakers had told them
that they would re win the business if they performed well, and (2) Japanese automakers had a
reputation for not switching suppliers at the model change. Thus, suppliers had the expectation of
a high degree of continuity in the relationship. With regard to face to face contact, the sample
engaged in 1475 man days of face to face contact with Japanese automakers versus 1657 man days
with U.S. automakers. On an absolute basis there are no significant differences.
Stock ownership was not a factor in these relationships since Japanese automakers did not own
stock in any suppliers in the sample.
The one variable that seemed to be critical to the Japanese automakers' ability to develop trusting
relationships with U.S. suppliers was offering assistance. U.S. suppliers indicated that, compared
to U.S. automakers, they received more assistance from Japanese automakers in reducing costs,
increasing quality, and improving delivery. Interestingly, the U.S. suppliers rated Japanese
automakers as providing even more assistance than did the Japanese suppliers. Some U.S.
suppliers indicated that they received more help from the Japanese automaker than they felt they
deserved given their short term relationship. They were surprised at the willingness of the
Japanese automaker to send consultants, free of charge, to help them improve. This type of
helping behavior on the part of Japanese automakers seemed to be the catalyst for creating, in
Gouldner's (1963) terminology, "a norm of reciprocal obligation."
Although U.S. suppliers claimed that they trusted Japanese automakers for the reasons suggested
in our model (i.e. assistance and continuity of relationship), our interviews revealed another
important factor not explicitly captured in our model but related to the idea of continuity of
relationship. U.S. suppliers indicated that one reason they did not trust U.S. automakers was
because U.S. automakers were perceived as constantly changing management, personnel, and
policies. One supplier executive described the "problem" as follows:
We cannot trust U.S. automakers as much as Japanese automakers because
whenever they bring in new management, we get a whole new set of procurement
rules and policies. The rules of the game are constantly changing. With Japanese
companies we don't seem to have the same problems because their policies and
personnel are consistent and stable (Author Interview, September, 1992).
The recent experience at GM's purchasing department is instructive. From 1987 until 1992, the
policy in GM's purchasing division was to create "global partnerships" with suppliers. GM began
to reduce its number of suppliers and encouraged suppliers to take responsibility for
development/design work. However, when J. Ingacio Lopez was promoted to run GM's
purchasing office in 1992, he required that GM buyers rebid virtually every part. Moreover, he
demanded that buyers get bids from at least five suppliers. Suppliers were stunned and outraged
because many felt that GM had broken both their explicit and implicit promises (Business Week,

<-----Page 14----->June 22, 1992). Some suppliers, including Rockwell International, refused to rebid and simply
walked away from the business (Wrigley, 1992). Then, one year later Mr. Lopez left GM to go to
Volkswagen. GM's future direction with suppliers is unclear.
The predictable consequence of frequent changes in purchasing management and policies is that
suppliers realize that implicit (and even explicit) promises made by the automaker may be broken
when new management arrives. Suppliers in our sample indicated that this problem is not only at
the management level but at the buyer level as well. As one supplier put it, "It's not that I don't
trust the person sitting across from me at the U.S. automaker. I may trust him completely. But
what I don't trust is that he will be sitting there a year from now. U.S. automakers are constantly
rotating their people through purchasing (Author Interview, Sept. 1992)."
U.S. suppliers claim that Japanese automakers are more trustworthy due to their lifetime
employment and "promotion from within" policies which foster stability. To test these assertions
we examined employee tenure in the Japanese and U.S. automakers in our sample. In particular,
we surveyed 100 U.S. employees (at 2 U.S. automakers) and 100 Japanese employees (at 2
Japanese automakers) to determine the average tenure of employment of purchasing and
engineering employees. We found that employees at the Japanese automakers had been with their
employer for an average of 16.2 years, while U.S. automaker employees had only been at their
company for 8.8 years. Helper and Sako (1995) found similar results among 472 executives of
Japanese automotive suppliers and 671 executives at U.S. suppliers. Japanese supplier executives
had been with their companies an average of 22 years, while U.S. executives had only been with
suppliers for 11 years. These data suggest significantly greater employment stability at the
Japanese firms, both automakers and suppliers. Greater employment stability may lead to higher
levels of interorganizational trust because: a) greater employment stability is likely to increase the
probability that the individuals who make commitments to suppliers are around to follow through
on those commitments, and b) individuals within the two firms have time to develop strong
personal ties and social knowledge, thereby increasing the efficacy of social sanctions as a means
of deterring opportunistic behavior.
Furthermore, although Japanese automakers also rotate their personnel, many U.S. suppliers
claimed that they were more likely to make agreements with teams of individuals and senior
managers rather than with individual buyers. Consequently, when the buyer is moved to a new
position, the team is still aware of the previously negotiated agreement. Moreover, during a job
rotation, Japanese companies are much more careful to make sure that the new person is well
trained and is aware of existing commitments.
In summary, an examination of the specific practices employed by Japanese automakers suggests
that they are effective at building interfirm trust because they provide assistance to suppliers, make
long term commitments and have continuity in the relationship, and maintain consistent
management policies. These findings suggest that interorganizational trust is based on trustworthy
behavior that is institutionalized and embedded within the firms' culture and routines.
Interpersonal trust between individual members of the two organizations does not constitute
interorganizational trust. However, while interorganizational trust cannot be created by individuals
acting on their own, individual actions may act as a starting mechanism for interorganizational trust
if these individuals can influence organization wide routines.

<-----Page 15----->CONCLUSION
In this paper we examined the determinants of trust in 453 automotive supplier buyer relationships
in the U.S., Japan, and Korea. The findings offer a number of important insights into the
determinants of trust in supplier buyer relationships. First, these findings suggest that providing
assistance (i.e. gift giving) is perhaps one of the best ways to create high levels of trust in supplier
buyer relationships. Gouldner's (1963) observation that one sided generosity may act as a starting
mechanism for non exploitive exchange relations is empirically supported. Automotive suppliers
appear to interpret assistance giving behavior as an act of goodwill or benevolence which translates
into a high degree of trust. In addition, supplier trust increases when the buyer has a track record
of maintaining a repeated, continuous exchange relationship with the supplier. One interpretation
of these findings is that trust is built on past history of behaviors or actions rather than promises,
face to face contact, or stock ownership (financial collateral bonds).
Second, our findings suggest that the institutional environment is an important factor which
influences the development of interorganizational trust. The absolute levels of supplier trust
differed by country, with Japanese supplier buyer relations characterized by relatively high levels
of trust when compared with their Korean and U.S. counterparts. However, the key role of the
institutional environment may be one of influencing the development of firm level practices which
influence trust. Indeed, we found that firm level practices which might be expected to influence the
development of trust differed somewhat by institutional environment. For example, offering
assistance to suppliers was a widely employed practice by Japanese and Korean automakers, but
not widely employed by U.S. automakers. Similarly, stock ownership was widely used in Japan,
and to a lesser extent in Korea, but not in the U.S. where U.S. automakers and suppliers preferred
to maintain arms length relationships. The set of practices employed by Japanese firms which we
found were effective at producing high levels of interfirm trust are arguably the product of a
particular national culture and a unique set of evolutionary and historical events (Nishiguchi,
1994).
Although the institutional environment appeared to influence the practices used to create supplier
trust, we found evidence of similarities in the determinants of trust across countries. For example,
"continuity of relationship" and "assistance giving" appeared to be robust as determinants of trust
across countries, especially when one includes the experience of Japanese automakers working
with U.S. suppliers. Indeed, the ability of Japanese automakers to build high levels of trust with
suppliers in the United States suggests that the institutional environment may be less important than
firm level practices as a factor influencing levels of supplier buyer trust. Japanese automakers
were successful at building high levels of supplier trust in an institutional environment considered
to be low trust relative to Japan (Sako, 1992; Shane, 1994). Thus, the creation of trust through
rational instrumental means appears to be possible and the set of practices that produce trust seem
to be transferable across national borders.
Third, our study suggests that building interorganizational trust is a much more complex process
than building interpersonal trust. To build high levels of interorganizational trust requires that
multiple individuals within the two organizations develop a high degree of continuity and stability
in their relationships. Furthermore, the organization must create a set of organizational routines (an
organizational culture) which supports and encourages trustworthy behavior on the part of all
organizational actors. This would suggest that a firm's reputation (based on those routines and
past behavior) is an important asset in building interorganizational trust.
Finally, we should note that buyers (i.e. automakers) incur real costs in developing high trust
supplier relations. These costs come in two forms. First, buyers must expend considerable
resources in providing assistance or offering "gifts" to suppliers. In 1992, Nissan and Toyota
supported large teams of more than 75 internal consultants to provide assistance to suppliers.
Although the Japanese automakers get a "return" on their investment in the form of more efficient

<-----Page 16----->suppliers, they still must incur the expense of maintaining a large staff of qualified individuals to
assist suppliers. Furthermore, there is an opportunity cost associated with maintaining long term,
continuous relationships with suppliers. The cost of maintaining continuity in supplier
relationships includes the opportunity cost of not taking advantage of one's suppliers and the loss
of the opportunity to use lower cost suppliers if they came along. The fact that building supplier
trust imposes costs on buyers suggests that trust building behavior should be carefully considered
with an analysis of both the costs and benefits.

<-----Page 22----->NOTES
• Investments in transaction specific assets have been found to enhance interfirm coordination and
maximize joint performance (Perry, 1989; Parkhe, 1993; Dyer)
• In our sample, the average distance between supplier plants and automaker plants was 82 miles
in Japan, 129 miles in Korea, and 477 miles in the United States.
• Although our model did a reasonably good at predicting supplier trust, clearly there must be
other important variables which are not accounted for in our model. However, since the formation
of a trusting relationship is such a nebulous and complex phoenomenon, a formal modeling effort
is bound to explain only part of the variance in trust.
• Korean automakers were excluded becuase they did not have plants in the United States.
• There was no particular reason for choosing 20 relationships other than there were not a large
number of suppliers that had significant experience working with both U.S. and Japanese
automakers.
• These findings are consistent with those of a market research firm, Planning Perspectives Inc.,
who conducted a survey of 700 U.S. suppliers for Chrysler and Ford in 1992. This large sample
survey found that U.S. suppliers had significantly higher trust in Toyota, Nissan, and Honda than
they did in the U.S. automakers.
• However, when we adjust for the volume of transactions (sales) between the supplier and
automaker, we find that U.S. suppliers engage in 50 percent more face to face contact (per dollar
of sales) with Japanese automakers.
• A vivid, though single case, illustration of the stability and organizational memory nurtured in
Japanese firms comes from Dr. Toshihiro Nishiguchi, a Hitotsubashi University professor who
worked for Pioneer Electronic Corporation from 1977 1983. Before he was sent to London by
Pioneer in 1982, he spent six weeks training his successor. This included not only a process of
familiarization with the normal office routine but also an extensive number of visits to other
company units and divisions as well as to outside service providers. Furthermore, before he left
he gave his successor a 20 page manual with "illustrations" (manga) on how to do the job
(Reported in Fruin, 1992, p.15).
