RISK AVERSION AND EXPECTED-UTILITY THEORY:
A CALIBRATION THEOREM
BY MATTHEW RABIN1

1. INTRODUCTION

USING EXPECTED-UTILITY THEORY, economists model risk aversion as arising solely
because the utility function over wealth is concave. This diminishing-marginal-utility-ofwealth theory of risk aversion is psychologically intuitive, and surely helps explain some
of our aversion to large-scale risk: We dislike vast uncertainty in lifetime wealth because
a dollar that helps us avoid poverty is more valuable than a dollar that helps us become
very rich.
Yet this theory also implies that people are approximately risk neutral when stakes are
small. Arrow (1971, p. 100) shows that an expected-utility maximizer with a differentiable
utility function will always want to take a sufficiently small stake in any positiveexpected-value bet. That is, expected-utility maximizers are (almost everywhere) arbitrarily close to risk neutral when stakes are arbitrarily small. While most economists
understand this formal limit result, fewer appreciate that the approximate risk-neutrality
prediction holds not just for negligible stakes, but for quite sizable and economically
important stakes. Economists often invoke expected-utility theory to explain substantial
(observed or posited) risk aversion over stakes where the theory actually predicts virtual
risk neutrality.
While not broadly appreciated, the inability of expected-utility theory to provide a
plausible account of risk aversion over modest stakes has become oral tradition among
some subsets of researchers, and has been illustrated in writing in a variety of different
contexts using standard utility functions.2 In this paper, I reinforce this previous research
by presenting a theorem that calibrates a relationship between risk attitudes over small
and large stakes. The theorem shows that, within the expected-utility model, anything but
virtual risk neutrality over modest stakes implies manifestly unrealistic risk aversion over

Loomes and Segal (1994), and Segal and Spivak (1990). Hansson's (1988) discussion is most similar
to the themes raised in this paper. He illustrates how a person who for all initial wealth levels is
exactly indifferent between gaining $7 for sure and a 50-50 gamble of gaining either $0 or $21
prefers a sure gain of $7 to any lottery where the chance of gaining positive amounts of money is
less than 40%-no matter how large the potential gain is.

large stakes.The theoremis entirely"nonparametric,"
assumingnothingaboutthe utility
functionexcept concavity.
In the next section I illustrateimplicationsof the theoremwith examplesof the form
"If an expected-utilitymaximizeralwaysturns down modest-stakesgamble X, she will
alwaysturn down large-stakesgamble Y." Supposethat, from any initialwealth level, a
person turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, each with 50%
probability.Then she will turn down 50-50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of
money.A personwho would alwaysturn down50-50 lose $1,000/gain $1,050bets would
alwaysturn down50-50 bets of losing $20,000or gainingany sum. These are implausible
degrees of risk aversion.The theoremnot only yields implicationsif we know somebody
will turn down a bet for all initial wealth levels. Supposewe knew a risk-averseperson
turns down 50-50 lose $100/gain $105 bets for any lifetime wealth level less than
$350,000,but knewnothingaboutthe degree of her risk aversionfor wealth levels above
$350,000.Then we knowthat from an initialwealthlevel of $340,000the personwill turn
down a 50-50 bet of losing $4,000and gaining$635,670.
The intuition for such examples, and for the theorem itself, is that within the
expected-utilityframework,turningdowna modest-stakesgamblemeansthat the marginal
utilityof money must diminishvery quicklyfor small changesin wealth. For instance,if
you reject a 50-50 lose $10/gain $11 gamblebecause of diminishingmarginalutility,it
must be that you value the eleventh dollaraboveyour currentwealthby at most (10/11)
as much as you valued the tenth-to-last-dollarof your currentwealth.3 Iteratingthis
observation,if you have the same aversionto the lose $10/gain $11 bet if you were $21
wealthier, you value the thirty-seconddollar above your current wealth by at most
(10/11) x (10/11); (5/6) as much as your tenth-to-last dollar. You will value your
two-hundred-twentieth
dollar by at most (3/20) as much as your last dollar, and your
dollarby at most (1/2,000) of your last dollar.This is an absurd
eight-hundred-eightieth
rate for the value of money to deteriorate-and the theorem shows the rate of
deteriorationimpliedby expected-utilitytheoryis actuallyquickerthan this. Indeed,the
theoremis reallyjust an algebraicarticulationof how implausibleit is that the consumption value of a dollarchangessignificantlyas a functionof whetheryourlifetimewealthis
$10, $100, or even $1,000 higher or lower. From such observationswe should conclude
that aversionto modest-stakesriskhas nothingto do with the diminishingmarginalutility
of wealth.
Expected-utilitytheory seems to be a useful and adequatemodel of risk aversionfor
many purposes,and it is especiallyattractivein lieu of an equallytractablealternative
model. "Extremely-concave
expectedutility"may even be useful as a parsimonioustool
for modelingaversionto modest-scalerisk.But this and previouspapersmake clear that
expected-utilitytheory is manifestlynot close to the right explanationof risk attitudes
over modest stakes. Moreover,when the specific structureof expected-utilitytheory is
used to analyzesituationsinvolvingmodeststakes-such as in researchthat assumesthat
large-stake and modest-stake risk attitudes derive from the same utility-for-wealth
3My wordinghere, as in the openingparagraphand elsewhere,gives a psychologicalinterpretation to the concavityof the utility function. Yet a referee has reminded me that a common
perspectiveamongeconomistsstudyingchoice underuncertaintyhas been that the concavityof the
utility function need be given no psychological interpretation. I add such a psychological interpretation throughout the paper as an aid to those readers who, like me, find this approach to be the
natural way to think about utility theory, but of course the mathematical results and behavioral
analysis in this paper hold without such interpretations.

function-it can be very misleading.In the concludingsection, I discussa few examples
of such researchwhere the expected-utilityhypothesisis detrimentallymaintained,and
speculate very briefly on what set of ingredientsmay be needed to provide a better
account of risk attitudes.In the next section, I discuss the theorem and illustrate its
implications.

SOME CALIBRATIONS BASED ON A THEOREM

Consideran expected-utilitymaximizerover wealth, w, with Von Neumann-Morgenstern preferencesU(w). Assume that the person likes money and is risk-averse:For all
w,U(w) is (strictly)increasingand (weakly)concave.Supposefurtherthat, for some range
of initialwealth levels and for some g > 1> 0, she will rejectbets losing $1 or gaining$g,
each with 50% chance.4 From the assumptionthat these bets will be rejected, the
theorem presented in this paper places an upper bound on the rate at which utility
increases above a given wealth level, and a lower bound on the rate at which utility
decreasesbelow that wealth level. Its proof is a short series of algebraicmanipulations;
both the theoremand proof are in the Appendix.Its basic intuitionis straightforward,
as
describedbrieflyin the introduction.
The theoremhandlescases wherewe knowa personto be averseto a gambleonly for
some rangesof initialwealth.A simplercorollary,also in the Appendix,holds when we
knowa lowerboundon risk aversionfor all wealthlevels. Table I illustratessome of the
corollary's\implications:Consider an individualwho is known to reject, for all initial
wealthlevels, 50-50,lose $100/gain g bets, for g = $101,$105, $110,and $125.The table
presentsimplicationsof the form "the personwill turn down 50-50 gamblesof losing L
and gainingG,"where each L is a row in the table and the highest G (usingthe bounds
establishedby the corollary)makingthe statement true is the entry in the table.5All
entries are roundeddownto an even dollaramount.
So, for instance,if a person alwaysturns down a 50-50 lose $100/gain $110 gamble,
she will alwaysturn down a 50-50 lose $800/gain $2,090gamble.Entriesof coare literal:
Somebodywho alwaysturnsdown50-50 lose $100/gain $125 gambleswill turndown any
gamblewith a 50%chanceof losing $600.This is because the fact that the boundon risk
aversionholds everywhereimpliesthat U(w) is boundedabove.
4 The assumption that U is concave is not implied by the fact that an agent always turns down a
given better-than-fair bet; if you know that a person always turns down 50-50 lose $10/gain $11 bets,
you don't know that her utility function is concave everywhere-it could be convex over small
ranges. (For instance, let U(w) = 1 - (W)Wfor w q (19, 20), but
Uw

=1(-

()

+

[

-(2

- 19)

for w e (19,20).) Concavity is an additional assumption, but I am confident that results hold
approximately if we allow such small and silly nonconvexities.
5 The theorem provides a lower bound on the concavity of the utility function, and its proof
indicates an obvious way to obtain a stronger (but uglier) result. Also, while the theorem and
applications focus on "50-50 bets," the point is applicable to more general bets. For instance, if an
expected-utility maximizer dislikes a bet with a 25% chance of losing $100 and a 75% chance of
winning $100, then she would turn down 50-50 lose $100/gain $300 bets, and we could apply the
theorem from there.

The theorem and corollary are homogeneous of degree 1: If we know that turning
down 50-50 lose i/gain g gambles implies you will turn down 50-50 lose L/gain G, then
for all x > 0, turning down 50-50 lose xl/gain xg gambles implies you will turn down
50-50 lose xL/gain xG. Hence the L = $10,000, g = $101 entry in Table I tells us that
turning down 50-50 lose $10/gain $10.10 gambles implies you will turn down 50-50 lose
$1,000/gain co gambles.
The reader may worry that the extreme risk aversion shown in Table I relies heavily on
the assumption that the person will turn down the given gamble for all initial wealth
levels. It doesn't. While without knowing a global lower bound on a person's modest-stakes
risk aversion we cannot assert that she'll turn down gambles with infinite expected return,
Table II indicates that the lack of a lower bound does not salvage the plausibility of
expected-utility theory. Table II shows calibrations if we know the person will turn down
50-50 lose $100/gain g gambles for initial wealth levels less than $300,000, indicating
which gambles she'll turn down starting from initial wealth level of $290,000. Large

If we only know that a person turns down 50-50 lose $100/gain $125 bets when her
lifetime wealth is below $300,000, we also know she will turn down a 50-50 lose
$600/gain $36 billion bet beginning from lifetime $290,000.6 The intuition is that the
extreme concavity of the utility function between $290,000 and $300,000 assures that the
marginal utility at $300,000 is tiny compared to the marginal utility at wealth levels below
$290,000; hence, even if the marginal utility does not diminish at all above $300,000, a
person will not care nearly as much about money above $300,000 as she does about
amounts below $290,000. The choice of $290,000 and $300,000 as the two focal wealth
levels is arbitrary;all that matters is that they are $10,000 apart. As with Table I, Table II
is homogeneous of degree 1, where the wedge between the two wealth levels must be
multiplied by the same factor as the other entries. Hence-multiplying Table II by 10-if
an expected-utility maximizer would turn down a 50-50 lose $1,000/gain $1,050 gamble
whenever her lifetime wealth is below $300,000, then from an initial wealth level of
$200,000 she will turn down a 50-50 lose $40,000/gain $6,356,700 gamble.
While these "nonparametric" calibrations are less conducive to analyzing more complex questions, Table III provides similar calibrations for decisions that resemble realworld investment choices by assuming conventional functional forms of utility functions.
It shows what aversion to various gambles implies for the maximum amount of money a
person with a constant-absolute-risk-aversion (CARA) utility function would be willing to

6
Careful examination of Tables I and II shows that most entries that are not ooin Table I show
up exactly the same in Table II. The two exceptions are those entries that are above $10,000-since
Table II implicitly makes no assumptions about concavity for gains of more than $10,000, it yields
lower numbers.

keep investedin the stock market,for reasonableassumptionsabout the distributionof
returnsfor stocks and bonds. Hence, an expected-utilitymaximizerwith CARA preferences who turnsdown50/50 lose $1,000/gain $1,200gambleswill only be willingto keep
$8,875of her portfolioin the stock market,no matterhow large her total investmentsin
stocks and bonds.If she turnsdown a 50/50 lose $100/gain $110 bet, she will be willing
to keep only $1,600 of her portfolio in the stock market-keeping the rest in bonds
(whichaverage6% lowerannualreturn).Whileit is widelybelievedthat investorsare too
cautiousin their investmentbehavior,no one believes they are this risk averse.

3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Expected-utilitytheory may well be a useful model of the taste for very-large-scale
insurance.7Despite its usefulness, however,there are reasons why it is importantfor
economiststo recognizehow miscalibratedexpected-utilitytheoryis as an explanationof
modest-scalerisk aversion.For instance, some research methods economists currently
employshouldbe abandonedbecause they rely cruciallyon the expected-utilityinterpretation of modest-scalerisk aversion.One examplearises in experimentaleconomics.In
recentyears,there has been extensivelaboratoryresearchin economicsin whichsubjects
interactto generate outcomeswith payoffson the order of $10 to $20. Researchersare
often interestedin inferringsubjects'beliefs fromtheir behavior.Doing so often requires
knowingthe relativevalue subjectshold for differentmoney prizes;if a person chooses
$5 in event A over $10 in event B, we knowthat she believes A is at least twice as likely
as B only if we can assume the person likes $10 at least twice as much as $5. Yet
economic theory tells us that, because of diminishingmarginalutility of wealth, we
should not assume people like $10 exactlytwice as much as $5. Experimentalists(e.g.,
Davis and Holt (1993, pp. 472-476)) have developed a clever scheme to avoid this
problem:Insteadof prizesof $10 and $5, subjectsare givenprizessuch as 10%chanceof
winning $100 vs. 5% chance of winning $100. Expected-utilitytheory tells us that,
irrespectiveof the utility function, a subjectvalues the 10% chance of a prize exactly
twice as much as the 5% chance of winningthe same prize.
The problemwith this lotteryprocedureis that it is knownto be sufficientonly when
we maintain the expected-utilityhypothesis. But then it is not necessary-since
expected-utilitytheorytells us that people will be virtuallyriskneutralin decisionson the
scale of laboratorystakes. If expected-utilitytheoryis right,these proceduresare at best
redundant,and are probablyharmful.8On the other hand, if we think that subjectsin
experimentsare risk averse, then we know they are not expected-utilitymaximizers.
Hence the lottery procedure,which is motivated solely by expected-utilitytheory's
assumptionsthat preferencesare linear in probabilitiesand that risk attitudescome only
7While there is also much evidencefor some limits of its applicabilityfor large-scalerisks,and
the results of this paper suggest an importantflaw with the expected-utilitymodel, the specific
resultsdo not of course demonstratethat the model is unusefulin all domains.
8 If expected-utility theory explained behavior, these procedures would surely not be worth the
extra expense, nor the loss in reliability of the data from making experiments more complicated. Nor
should experimentalists who believe in expected-utility theory ever be cautious about inferences
made from existing experiments that don't use the lottery methods out of fear that the results are
confounded by the subjects' risk attitudes.

from the curvatureof the utility-of-wealthfunction, has little presumptivevalue in
"neutralizing"risk aversion.Perhapsthere are theories of risk attitudessuch that the
lotteryprocedureis useful for neutralizingriskaversion-but expected-utilitytheoryisn't
one of them.9
A second exampleof problematicresearchmethodsrelates to the logic underlyingthe
theorem: Expected-utilitytheory makes wrong predictionsabout the relationshipbetween risk aversionover modest stakes and risk aversionover large stakes.Hence, when
measuringrisk attitudesmaintainingthe expected-utilityhypothesis,differencesin estimates of risk attitudesmay come from differencesin the scale of risk comprisingdata
sets, rather than from differencesin risk attitudesof the people being studied.10Data
sets dominatedby modest-riskinvestmentopportunitiesare likely to yield much higher
estimatesof riskaversionthan data sets dominatedby larger-scaleinvestmentopportunities. So not only are standardmeasuresof riskaversionsomewhathardto interpretgiven
that people are not expected-utilitymaximizers,but even attempts to compare risk
attitudesso as to compareacross groupswill be misleadingunless economistspay due
attentionto the theory'scalibrationalproblems.
The problemswith assumingthat risk attitudesover modest and large stakes derive
from the same utility-of-wealthfunction relate to a long-standingdebate in economics.
Expected-utilitytheory makes a powerfulpredictionthat economic actors don't see an
amalgamationof independentgamblesas significantinsuranceagainstthe risk of those
gambles;they are either barelyless willing or barelymore willing to accept riskswhen
clumpedtogether than when apart.This observationwas introducedin a famousarticle
by Samue,lson(1963),who showed that expected-utilitytheory implies that if (for some
sufficientlywide range of initialwealth levels) a person turns down a particulargamble,
then she should also turn down an offer to play n > 1 of those gambles.Hence, in his
example, if Samuelson'scolleague is unwillingto accept a 50-50 lose $100/gain $200
gamble, then he should be unwillingto accept 100 of those gambles taken together.
ThoughSamuelson'stheoremis "weaker"than the one in this paper,it makes manifest
the fact that expected-utilitytheory predictsthat addingtogether a lot of independent
risksshould not appreciablyalter attitudestowardsthose risks.

9Indeed, the observation that diminishing marginal utility of wealth is irrelevant in laboratory
experiments raises questions about interpreting experimental tests of the adequacy of expectedutility theory. For instance, while showing that existing alternative models better fit experimental
data than does expected-utility theory, Harless and Camerer (1994) show that expected-utility theory
better fits experimental data than does "expected-value theory"-risk-neutral expected-utility theory. But because expected-utility theory implies that laboratory subjects should be risk neutral, such
evidence that expected-utility theory explains behavior better than expected-value theory is evidence
against expected-utility theory.
10 Indeed, Kandel and Stambaugh (1991, pp. 68-69) discuss how the plausibility of estimates for
the coefficient of relative risk aversion may be very sensitive to the scale of risk being examined.
Assuming constant risk aversion, they illustrate how a coefficient of relative risk aversion needed to
avoid predicting absurdly large aversion to a 50/50 lose $25,000/gain $25,000 gamble generates
absurdly little aversion to a 50/50 lose $400/gain $400 gamble. They summarize such examples as
saying that "Inferences about [the coefficient of relative risk aversion] are perhaps most elusive
when pursued in the introspective context of thought experiments." But precisely the same problem
makes inferences from real data elusive.

Yet virtuallyeverybodywouldfind the aggregatedgambleof 100 50-50 lose $100/gain
$200 bets attractive.It has an expectedyield of $5,000,with negligiblerisk:There is only
a (1/700) chance of losing any money and merely a (1/25,000) chance of losing more
than $1,000.11While nobody would turn down this gamble, many people, such as
Samuelson'scolleague,might reject the single 50-50 lose $100/gain $200 bet.12Hence,
using expected-utilitytheory to make inferences about the risk attitudes towardsthe
amalgamatedbet from the reactionto the one bet-or vice versa-would be misleading.
What does explain risk aversion over modest stakes? While this paper provides a
"proof by calibration"that expected-utilitytheory does not help explain some risk
attitudes,there are of course more direct tests showingthat alternativemodels better
captureriskattitudes.There is a largeliterature(see Machina(1987)and Camerer(1992)
for reviews)of formalmodelsof such alternatives.Manyof these modelsseem to provide
a more plausible account of modest-scalerisk attitudes,allowingboth substantialrisk
aversion over modest stakes and nonridiculousrisk aversion over large stakes, and
researchers(e.g., Segal and Spivak(1990), Loomes and Segal (1994), Epstein and Zin
(1990)) have explicitlyaddressedhow non-expected-utilitytheory can help account for
small-stakerisk aversion.
Indeed,what is empiricallythe most firmlyestablishedfeature of riskpreferences,loss
aversion,is a departurefromexpected-utilitytheorythat providesa directexplanationfor
modest-scaleriskaversion.Loss aversionsaysthat people are significantlymore averseto
losses relativeto the status quo than they are attractedby gains,and more generallythat

11
The theorem in this paper predicts that, under exactly the same assumptions invoked by
Samuelson, turning down a 50-50 lose $100/gain $200 gamble implies the person turns down a 50-50
lose $200/gain $20,000 gamble. This has an expected return of $9,900-with zero chance of losing
more than $200.
12As Samuelson noted, the strong statement that somebody should turn down the many bets if
and only if she turns down the one is not strictly true if a person's risk attitudes change at different
wealth levels. Indeed, many researchers (e.g., Hellwig (1995) and Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987)) have
explored features of the utility function such that an expected-utility maximizer might take a
multiple of a favorable bet that they would turn down in isolation. But characterizing such instances
isn't relevant to examples of the sort discussed by Samuelson. We know from the unwillingness to
accept a 50/50 lose $100/gain $200 gamble that Samuelson's colleague was not an expected-utility
maximizer.
13 Loss aversion was introduced by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) as part of the more general
'prospect theory," and is reviewed in Kahneman, Knetch, and Thaler (1991). Tversky and Kahneman (1991) and others have estimated the loss-aversion-to-gain-attraction ratio to be about 2:1.
14 While most formal definitions of loss aversion have not made explicit the assumption that
people are substantially risk averse even for very small risks (but see Bowman, Minehart, and Rabin
(1999) for an explicit treatment of this issue), most examples and calibrations of loss aversion imply
such small-scale risk aversion.

But Kahneman and Lovallo (1993), Benartzi and Thaler (1995), and Read, Loewenstein, and
Rabin (1999) argue that an additional departure from standard assumptions implicated in many risk
attitudes is that people tend to isolate different risky choices from each other in ways that lead to
different behavior than would ensue if these risks were considered jointly. Samuelson's colleague, for
instance, might reject each 50/50 lose $100/gain $200 gamble if on each of 100 days he were
offered one such gamble, whereas he might accept all of these gambles if they were offered to him at
once. Benartzi and Thaler (1995) argue that a related type of myopia is an explanation for the
"equity premium puzzle"-the mystery about the curiously large premium on returns that investors
seem to demand to compensate for riskiness associated with investing in stocks. Such risk aversion
can be explained with plausible (loss-averse) preferences-if investors are assumed to assess gains
and losses over a short-run (yearly) horizon rather than the longer-term horizon for which they are
actually investing.

PROOF OF PART (i) OF THEOREM: For notational ease and without loss of generality, let
r(w) -= U(w) - U(w - 1) = 1. Then clearly U(w - 1) - U(w - 21) 2 1, by the concavity of U(). Also,
since 21 > g > 1, we know that w - 21 + g E (w - 1,w), and by the concavity of UQ-)we know that

g -1

U(w - 21 +g) - U(w - 1)

g
1

Hence,

U(w-21+g)

- U(w-21)

- 11 +=

~1I

Hence, if w - 21> w, we know that U(w - 21) - U(w - 31) 2 (g/l) since by assumption, U(w 21 -1) + U(w - 21 + g) < 2u(w - 21). By concavity, we also know that U(w - 31) - U(w - 41) 2
(g/l). More generally, if w - 2kl 2 w, then
U(w - (2k - 1)1) - U(w - 2kl) ? U(w - 2(k - 1)1) - U(w - (2k - 1)1)

- [U(w - 2(k - 1)1) - U(w - (2k - 1)1)].

These lower bounds on marginal utilities yield the lower bound on total utilities U(w) - U(w - x)
in part (i) of the Theorem.16

PROOF OF PART (ii) OF THEOREM: Again let r(w)
U(w) - U(w -1) = 1. Then U(w + g) - U(w)
<1. By the concavity of U, U(w+g)-U(w+g-1)<(l/g).
But if w+g<w,
this implies by
assumption that U(w + 2g) - U(w + g) < (l/g) (since U(w + g -1) + U(w + 2g) < 2U(w + g)).
More generally, we know that if w + mg < w-,then
U(w + mg +g)

- U(w + mg) 2 (1/g)[U(w

+ mg) - U(w + mg -g)].

These upper bounds on marginal utilities yield the upper bound on utilities U(w + x) - U(w) in part
(ii) of the Theorem.

16

The theorem is weaker than it could be. If we observe, for all m such that 2 < m < w - w-+ 1,

that
U(w - m) - U(w - m -1)

2 U(w - m + 1) - U(w - m)

+

(

-

1) [U(w-m

+ 2)-U(w

-m + 1)],

we can prove a stronger (but far messier) theorem. (The current theorem merely invokes U(w - m)
- U(w - m - 1) ? U(w - m + 1) - U(w - m) for even m's.)

COROLLARY:SUppose that for all w, U(w) is strictly increasing and weakly concave. Suppose there
existsg > I > 0 such that, for all w, .5U(w - 1) + .5U(w + g) < U(w). Thenfor all positive integersk, for
