OF THE CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH IN THEORIZING
PROCESSS
Erno Tornikoski

Abstract
The researchers in the entrepreneurship field seem not to be able to agree whether we have solid theories to be
tested or not. It is clear that we need more systematic research in the field to understand the unique processes, and
we need to develop distinctive methodologies and approaches to explore them. The point of departure of this
conceptual paper is grounded in three general statements. First, a theory should be taken as a continuum, rather than
a dichotomy. Second, multiparadigm perspectives should be used in theory building. Third, the theories of
entrepreneurship should be grounded in psychology and sociology, if they are going to have any theoretical
validity. As such, this paper explores what is theorizing process, and how different paradigmatic approaches can be
used in this process. Furthermore, this paper explores the use of the constructivist approach. A central part of the
constructivist approach is structuration theory, which is a challenging and complex version of sociological theory,
and offers a multiparadigmatic perspective. This paper claims that by adopting these new views one could
overcome the distinction between objectivist and subjectivist research traditions, and combine the structure/agency
paradox. This could result better theories and theorizing processes in entrepreneurship research.
Introduction
As the research on entrepreneurship has increased considerably during the last years, the field should be
progressing. Yet, the research field seems not to be able to agree whether we have solid theories to be tested (Low,
MacMillan, 1988) or not (Bygrave, 1989; MacMillan, Katz, 1992). The research seems to be focused on empirical
studies with a rather low level of abstraction (Landstom, 1998). Furthermore, entrepreneurship research seems to be
done mostly in accordance with positivistic ideologies. We try to find average entrepreneurs and typical venture
processes, when entrepreneurship is usually considered to be an atypical phenomenon: a departure from norms of
the average behaviour (Stevenson, Jarillo, 1990) along a discontinuous, non-linear, and usually unique process
(Bygrave, 1989). It is a time to accept that there are many kinds of entrepreneurs and many kinds of new venture
processes.
It is also clear that more systematic research is needed in the field to understand these processes and distinctive
methodologies and approaches need to be developed to explore them. Indeed, some researchers invent new
methodologies, like 'case-surveys' (e.g. Larsson, 1993) to bridge the cap between nomothetic and ideographic
studies. Similarly, researchers use different metaphors to describe the essentials of the phenomenon:
entrepreneurship is associated with social networking, management of ambiguity (Johannisson, 1992), and
emergence of an organization (Gartner, Bird, Starr, 1992).

<-----Page 1----->However, this paper claims that we will not achieve progress in entrepreneurship research by inventing new
methods or developing new metaphors as such. Instead, one should recognize their role and use in the theorizing
process in the first place. According to this view a theory should be taken as a continuum, rather than a dichotomy.
Furthermore, multiparadigm perspectives should be used in theory building (Gioia, Pitre, 1990). Last, seems that
the theories of entrepreneurship should be grounded in psychology and sociology, if they are going to have any
theoretical validity (Bygrave, 1989).
This paper aims to explore what is theorizing process, and how different paradigmatic approaches can be used in
this process. Furthermore, this paper introduces the constructivist approach in form of Giddens' (1984) structuration
theory, which is a challenging and complex version of sociological theory (Tucker, 1998). It is also regarded as a
multiparadigmatic perspective bridging positivistic and subjectivistic research traditions (Gioia, Pitre, 1990), and
thus seems to be a potential approach for the present purpose.
By adopting these new views one could overcome the distinction between objectivist and subjectivist research
traditions and the structure/action paradox, which in turn could result better theories and theorizing processes in
entrepreneurship research.
Entrepreneurship: theorizing and structuring
What is a theory and theory development? Usually theory is regarded to be an answer to a question 'why':
"Theory is about the connections among phenomena, a story about why acts, events, structure, and
thoughts occur. Theory emphasizes the nature of causal relationships, identifying what comes first
as well as the timing of such events." (Sutton, Staw, 1995, p. 378).
So, a theory is good and useful when it describes, explains, and predicts (Whetten, 1989; Bacharach, 1989). As
such, one takes the standpoint of positivism, which holds that science can generate objective knowledge. Scientific
knowledge is cumulative, and the role of individual studies is to contribute to the existing knowledge. Knowledge
is originated from experience obtained through the senses. Experience reflects the organized properties of the
outside material, social, or psychological world. The source of knowledge is thus the object.
On the other hand, anti-positivists reject these assumptions. For anti-positivists science is subjective rather than
objective: one can understand human activities only by occupying the frame of reference of the participant in
action. Scientific knowledge does not exist in the sense that it would consist of universal laws and causalities. The
perceived organized properties of the known objects are subject dependent: reality is the product of human
consciousness. The source of knowledge is thus the subject. The subjectivist approach holds that a theory is in fact
constructing reality, rather than describing it (Landry, 1995).
According to Bacharac (1989), space and time dimensions restrict the use of theories. For example in the
organizational studies, when a theory applies only to specific types of organizations, the theory has a spatial
boundary. According to the temporal restriction, a theory can either apply over different historical periods or just
one specific period. Four distinct types of theories can be identified by using the space and time dimensions
(Table 1).

Then, in general, where can entrepreneurship theory be places? Is entrepreneurship theory unbounded both by the
time and the space (IV)? In other words, could there be a grand entrepreneurship theory that is timeless and
spaceless, that would apply to every entrepreneurship process over long historical periods? This is what positivistic
research tradition is more or less claiming. Furthermore, if entrepreneurship would be considered to be a science,
the aim of research is to reveal the hidden mechanism that has an independent existence outside the human
existence. For example, our universe functions according to the mechanism that is best described at the moment by
Einstein's relativity theory and quantum physics: the planets would continue circulate their orbits, even though
humans did not exist in the world. By accepting these, determinism takes over; the outcome of the entrepreneurship
process is contingent on the environment. Humans may have a freewill, but only in a limited sense: environment
constructs 'a room', inside where humans can freely act.
Entrepreneurship research can also be biased towards successful individuals (Bouchikhi 1993); the success of
entrepreneurship process is attributed to an individual, whereas the context has minimal or no effects on the
outcome. In entrepreneurship field researchers often take theories and instruments from other fields to discover
individual's underlying (psychological or cognitive) mechanism. Sophisticated measurements are made in order to
discover the effects of combinations of different personal variables. These measurements are made with a belief
that unique and stable personality or motivational characteristics have significant effects (Carsrud, Krueger, 1995),
and that these variables should be consistent across time and in different situations (Stevenson and Harmeling,
1990; Kilby, 1971). As such, this line of research is also following the scientific research traditions.
On the other hand, when entrepreneurship theory is bounded both by the time and space (I), this would be the
standpoint of subjectivist theorists. The danger here is that there would not be any 'scientific' theories to discuss
about. For example, narrative methodology has recently gain some success among entrepreneurship researchers.
When one uses narratives in subjectivist terms, stories are fluid and culturally determined forms of discourse whose
real meanings can never be known: "...human lives are constituted by stories, stories are forms of discourse
embedded in culturally determined language games, all language is indeterminate, and therefore little can be ever
really known" (McAdams et al., 1997, p. 690). Thus a single study would not contribute on or develop 'general'
knowledge. This gives the positivistic researchers a reason to associate subjectivism with skepticism (e.g. Estany,
1997), which questions the reliability of the knowledge.
As a sum, for positivist researchers the goal of the research is to search for regularities and test in order to predict
and control. If one accepts subjectivism as point of departure, the purpose of research is to describe and explain in
order to diagnose and understand. If something can be learned from this, at least theory building is not a universal
and transcendent across disparate paradigmatic assumptions (Gioia, Pitre, 1990) and that a paradigmatic approach
should not be criticized in terms of another. Moreover, this paper claims that one can and one should try to bridge

<-----Page 3----->between these two viewpoints by seeing theory development as a theorizing process and using alternative
paradigmatic approaches.
From theory to theorizing
References, data, variables, and hypothesis are not a theory when it is regarded as a product. However, if one takes
theory development as a process, the previous ones can be regarded as approximations of theories. In fact, products
of theorizing are most often approximations, rather than complete theories Weick (1995). A theory is a continuum
rather than a dichotomy (Runkel, Runkel, 1984). Therefore, theorizing can start from concepts so that the process
generates possible connections between these concepts. Also metaphors serve as precursors to theories (Bacharach,
1989).
Tsoukas (1991) has discussed the role and function of metaphorical and literal language in theory development.
His 'metaphorical transformation' describes how metaphors can be used in theorizing process. Tsoukas (1991)
points that a metaphorical language is a better alternative than a literal language to express continuous flow of
experience. This is because metaphorical language does not contain only statements of 'real' processes, but also
evokes commonly upheld images, pass value judgements, and prescribe a mode of behavior (also Steyaert,
Bouwen, 199X). Therefore, metaphorical language is mostly used in the subjectivist approach and qualitative
research, which enables the researchers to focus upon, explain, and influence different aspects of complex
phenomena.
However, the use of the metaphorical language means that the humans are less able to abstract and explain their
experiences. This is because humans are usually too close to their own experiences: it is rather difficult to detach
oneself from experience in order to abstract it and explain it (Tsoukas, 1991). Because of its imprecision and low
conceptual content, a metaphorical language is not used in the positivistic research and in most of the quantitative
approaches. Instead, the researchers are encouraged to use literal language, i.e. formal theories. Literal language
tries to re-describe the world in order to discover the underlying mechanism responsible of the phenomenon
(Tsoukas, 1991). So, Tsoukas was indeed speaking on behalf of theorizing process. The next simplified figure
(omitted) illustrates the theorizing process.
Theorizing process can be started with initial subjective experiences (metaphorical language) in order to pursue
formal theories. First, metaphorical language enables a person to express an experience that would otherwise be
difficult to conceptualize, because literal terms are not available. Metaphors offer initial insights to lived
experience, which may lead to the hypothesis of plausible causal mechanism. These causal mechanism can be
found if the literal core of the metaphors are revealed (Tsoukas, 1991): ... the transformational view of metaphors
advocated here is a process in which the initial metaphorical insight is progressively disposed of its literal variety
through set of homomorphic transformations, until, it is hoped, an invariance is revealed in the form of a scientific
model".
Existing theories can be taken from other fields to explore entrepreneurship phenomenon. More quantitative
techniques are used to test relationships on the basis of confirmed or disconfirmed predictions. However, as the
entrepreneurship field is just trying to find its own identity, ideographic approaches allows one to find and explain
causal relationships in the first place (Bacharach, 1989). By starting with more grounded approaches, fresh insights
could be generated about individuals' experiences in entrepreneurship processes. The task of researchers is to
abstract and conceptualize these experiences to be further tested and developed to construct better theories.
Yet, even though theory development is taken as a theorizing process and different research approaches are used
within the process, a distinction is still made between the different research traditions. Alternative paradigmatic
approaches are needed to combine different research traditions into single frameworks.

<-----Page 4----->Alternative Paradigmatic Approach
The paper introduces the constructivist approach. According to Bouchikhi (1993) the grounds of constructivism. are
on the works of Piaget (1977) and Giddens' (1984). In this paper more emphasis is given to the Giddens'
structuration theory. Structuration refers to the process of production and reproduction of social systems. Human
activity is structuring the reality in the first place. However, the structured reality tends to become 'objective' to
humans: "...organizational members treat the result of ongoing structuring processes as external, objective reality"
(Gioia, Pitre, 1990). So, structures are both the medium and the outcome of interactions, both constraining and
facilitating human action (Giddens, 1984).
The structuration theory accepts the existence of 'objective' structures, which are the result of individuals' own
actions. This is a link to objectivism. However, structures and context are not barriers to action but involved in its
production (Pettigrew 1992). Individuals can act against the existing structures, if they are willing to pay the
consequences of their deviant behavior; individuals are not totally constrained by the objective structures, at least in
the long run. This is a link to subjectivism, and described by Stevenson and Harmeling (1990, p. 6): "Although
individual behavior displays inherently conservative characteristics, individuals are important vehicles for and
initiators of change over the long run". As such, constructivism is indeed bridging the cap between subjectivism
and objectivism (e.g. Gioia, Pitre, 1990). Instead of making a distinction between agent and structure, which is one
of the paradoxes of the social sciences (Poole, Van de Ven, 1989), it takes them as a duality by connecting human
action with structural explanation (Riley, 1983). Furthermore, in sociological theories the level of analysis is
traditionally the society, whereas in the psychological theories it is the individual (Landstrom, 1998). The
structuration theory combines these two levels of analysis. The next figure (omitted) summarizes the previous
points.
Double hermeneutic and entrepreneurship
One of the interesting concepts of Giddens' structuration theory is 'double hermeneutic', which characterizes social
sciences. Social sciences do not intend to discover hidden mechanisms like natural sciences. Instead, the results of
social sciences' studies become parts of the very phenomena they are studying. In other words, when the social
scientist's findings can become available to the public, they are integrated into everyday life (Tucker, 1998). This
effect or transformation can be demonstrated by looking at the phenomenon of entrepreneurship in the Finnish
context.
Entrepreneurship was closely associated with capitalism few decades ago in Finland. That is, entrepreneurship did
not have very positive image in the society, or at least entrepreneurship or small businesses were not regarded as
worth of public policies. It was common to admire a regular salary in a big firm, as a response to the uncertainty
people faced in their local agricultural based milieus. Management studies were about long range planning,
diversification, and internationalization problems of big corporations.
However, somewhere in the 80's there started to be studies that showed the influence of small firms on the job
creation. Especially related to the recent economical recession, the public policies started gradually recognize the
small business creation phenomenon. Nowadays entrepreneurship is the solution to many economical problems.
We have development programs to incorporate entrepreneurship to all levels of our educational system: even at the
kindergarten level children are thought to be more entrepreneurial. The transformation that entrepreneurship has
faced in the society has been profound. As we became aware of the phenomenon, we have adopted it into our daily
practices. Natural sciences do not have this kind of effect on their objects of study. For example, when Einstein's
relativity theory replaced the Newton's theory of gravity, it did not change the underlying mechanism of the natural

<-----Page 5----->world. Instead, the relativity theory described it better than Newton's theory did. It was the researchers, and
eventually the grand public that had to change their views of the (natural) reality.
The production of a 'grand social theory' is not perhaps possible, as the society is under continuous change and
scientific findings become part of the daily life. What can be done is to provide better insights into the phenomenon
of entrepreneurship, which gradually becomes part of the existing daily life and knowledge. This in turn could
foster the overall entrepreneurial behavior in the societies.
Social mechanisms and entrepreneurship
If there are no 'natural' mechanisms explaining the entrepreneurship phenomenon, perhaps there are 'social'
mechanisms. However, the nature of these social mechanisms is different from natural ones: they are not only
constraining human action but also facilitating. The role of these social mechanisms can be understood by looking
again at the previous illustration.
As pointed earlier, few decades ago entrepreneurship was not highly recognized or respected phenomenon in
Finnish society. The social institutions were against, or at least not supporting entrepreneurial behavior. Yet, there
were entrepreneurs and new ventures in the society. Therefore, entrepreneurship was basically a deviant behavior
from 'normal' human conduct. Therefore, when someone acted entrepreneurial way and thus against the existing
social structures, it manifested the use of free-will. Therefore, it is understandable that researchers, like McClelland
(1961), focused their inquiries on the individual and their characteristics hoping that they would understand and
explain this deviant behavior.
On the contrary, public policies and other means are used to foster entrepreneurship at the present day's society. In
fact, social institutions almost require the individuals to behave entrepreneurial way. If one is unemployed, one
recommendation is to start one's own business. Employees are encouraged to establish their own businesses, as
companies try to downsize and outsource their activities. Entrepreneurship education is becoming part of business
schools, which encourage their students to launch entrepreneurial ventures, etc. As such, entrepreneurship is not
any more a deviant behavior, instead to act non-entrepreneurial way would be a deviant behavior... In this kind of
context one can perhaps use more deterministic models to explain the entrepreneurship phenomenon. The point
here is that we cannot understand the entrepreneurship phenomenon, if we don't take into account the duality of
structure/agency, and how it manifests itself in the societies.
There are many different contexts where entrepreneurship phenomenon can exist in a society. A specific
entrepreneurship theory may be developed in a high-tech field, but does not necessarily apply to an agricultural
context at the same time. Moreover, an entrepreneurship theory, which is applicable in the West, is not in the East.
Therefore, an entrepreneurship theory is likely to be restricted by space. Furthermore, entrepreneurship theory is
more likely to be bounded by time. For example, Stevenson and Harmeling (1992) argue that there is no long-run
equilibrium in society, instead there is evidence for chaos. Kilby (1971) has already pointed out that the pioneering
innovations of Schumpterian entrepreneurship are largely irrelevant in modem economies, instead the operational
problems of organizing resources are considerable greater than before. That is, an entrepreneurship theory could
only apply to a certain period of time, as institutional changes of the society give new contexts where
entrepreneurship phenomena can exist. So, to understand the entrepreneurship phenomenon requires that the social
institutions, which are constraining or facilitating entrepreneurial behavior and which are under a constant change,
should be recognized.
To have a guideline for empirical research and a tool to start a theorizing process in entrepreneurship, this paper
presents next a conceptual framework based on constructivism and structuration theory.

<-----Page 6----->A Constructivist framework for entrepreneurship process studies
To keep the discussion relatively short in this paper, the next figure presents a framework for entrepreneurship
process studies. The framework is a result of a conceptual work. It is based on Bouchikhi's (1993) constructivist
framework (see Appendix 1-omitted), Filion's (1990) metamodel of visionary process, Bird's (1988) Intention
framework, Weick's (1995) sensemaking framework, personal network theory (e.g. Johannisson 1988), a metaphor
of organizational emergence (e.g. Gartner 1985; Gartner, Bird, Starr, 1992) and cognitive dimension in general (for
full discussion see Tornikoski, 1999).
First, there is a need to define explicitly the entrepreneurship process: "the entrepreneurship process starts with an
entrepreneurial mind that conceptually envisions a new business reality and then starts to concretely enact it on the
market through committing other actors to the process" (cf. Johannisson 1998). As such, the dimension 'new
business reality' is the result of the process. This definition follows loosely the metaphor that sees entrepreneurship
as emergence of an organization (e.g. Gartner, 1985; Gartner et al., 1992), where entrepreneurship is defined in
terms of actions the individual(s) take, rather than in terms of attributes they possess (e.g. Kilby, 1971).
Rather than using a general 'behavior' concept, like (see Appendix 1), this paper uses sensemaking framework
(Weick 1995) to combine cognitive and action dimensions of human conduct into one concept. What is interesting
in the sense-making framework, is the fact that Weick emphasize the concept of identity. An identity construct can
be viewed as an initiator of actions (Wyer and Srull 1984). If a person is unsatisfied of his self-image, he is also
motivated to act in a way that his self-image is changed. So, for an entrepreneur it is not easy to decide what he
wants to become, without first realizing what he is (Filion 1990; also Gatewood et al. 1995). An individual must
identify himself as an entrepreneur, before action is taken towards entrepreneurship.
The concept intention is grounded in the cognitive psychology, which attempts to explain or predict human
behavior (Boyd, Vozikis, 1994). Intention can be seen as a state of mind that focuses a person's attention,
experience, and behavior toward a specific object or method of behaving (Bird 1988). It proves to be the best single
predictor of that behavior (Krueger, Brazeal, 1994). According to Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) the origin of
behavioral intention is attitudes toward performing certain task based on belief that certain consequence will occur.
Intention is thus regarded as an immediate determinant of behavior. For example, most decisions to start up
something are affected by how founders perceive and interpret the environment (Bird 1988). In other words, before
any action is taken towards entrepreneurship, an individual has to have not only the 'right' identity, but also
intention to act towards that direction.
The identity structure of an entrepreneur is not a fixed, i.e. it can, and it even should change during the process as a
result of the successes or failures along the processes: entrepreneurs are in constant pressure to change and they
change (Carsrud, Krueger, 1995). Also, intentions are either strengthened or weakened based on success of the
process: for example, success in finding a new idea, getting support, or gathering resources strengthens the
entrepreneur's intentions, and vice versa.
The environment and its social institutions are either facilitating or constraining the individuals and the venture
project. Usually the word 'environment' is used to describe everything that is outside an individual. The danger is
that the concept becomes vague if it is used in too many cases (Sanner, 1997). When an individual takes action, he
enacts part of the general environment, which can be called context. So, the concept context is used when a specific
part of the general environment is enacted. Furthermore, throughout the entrepreneurship process different contexts
need to be enacted. In the beginning of the process an entrepreneur's context may be relatively small, as he has an
influence only to a small part of the general environment. When an entrepreneur succeeds to enact a new
relationship his context grows, as new elements are included into the older one. At the same time his influence over
the environment increases. A context can be either 'enactable' or 'un-enactable'. A specific context may be

<-----Page 7----->unenactable for several reasons: there may be a competing enactment, which reaches a critical mass of belief and
acceptance, or people may lack sufficient resources to enact a specific relation (Smircich, Stubbart, 1985).
The entrepreneur and the different enacted contexts form a relation system, which brings together different actors
over time. It consists of the different actors enacted within the process (resource providers, friends, colleagues, etc.)
that are all contributing to the outcome. As the process moves on and the relation system takes more permanent
forms, the process and the relation system becomes institutionalized, i.e. an 'objective' reality is created for the
participants. The relation system enables the individual to get access to different resources. At the same time, the
relation system is constraining the individuals, as expectations, trust, and other social institutions are formed. This
follows closely the personal networking theory (e.g. Johannisson 1988).
Giddens' (1984) structuration theory emphasizes the unintended outcomes of human behavior: even though
individuals would be most rational in their decision making, their actions have also unintended outcomes, which are
out of their control. Therefore, according to Bouchikhi it is time to accept chance as a part of entrepreneurship
processes This is also shared by Gartner (1993), who relates chance and intentions: "Intentions are not necessarily
operationalizable without the necessary circumstances". This suggestion is very bold, because normally the role of
science is to minimize the role of chance in order to make novel predictions. In the success stories of entrepreneurs,
chance or luck seems to play an important role (Bouchikhi, 1993). For example, an individual might give the
impression that it was pure chance that he met a particular resource provider. However, the situation can also be
interpreted that it was not chance but a determined mind in search of resources that made the individual meet the
resource provider, or allowed him to give a meaning to a stranger met 'by accident'. It is the post-rationalization
process (sense-making) of the individual that makes him attribute some role to chance. Still, chance may have an
impact at the different stages of the process. For example, when a business partner suddenly dies, this unexpected
event may jeopardize the whole venture. Chance is thus an unexpected event coming from outside the
entrepreneurial process, to which a meaning is given by the participants. Chance has an impact to the relation
system, i.e. to the whole process, not to a specific enacted context as such. Indeed, the role of chance is perhaps a
matter of philosophical issue.
In the framework different sub-process are presented in separate long arrows. Although these subprocesses exist
simultaneously, the process can be imagined to start when an individual (1) identifies himself as an entrepreneur.
The individual goes through some kind of mental activity or internal struggle before the right identity is formed
(e.g. Collis et al. 1964). This is shared also with Schendel and Hofer (1979) and Westley and Mintzberg (1989),
who state that an entrepreneurial mind starts the entrepreneurship process. Some authors also speak about an
anticipatory socialization process that precedes the cognitive choice to become an entrepreneur (Starr and Fondas
1991).
After this, or already during the previous sub-process, (2) the entrepreneur needs to search for a new idea, test and
develop it, get support, etc. This is perhaps the most crucial phase or stage of the process: the original idea has to be
born before anything can happen. Furthermore, the original idea needs also to be developed into a vision. In the
beginning an individual might have initial ideas or scenarios, which can be related to many potential new business
concepts. Along the interaction process a central vision may emerge out of the initial ideas. Usually the central
vision is not too fixed, as the environment brings changes, new ideas appear, etc. In other words, along the process,
new ideas are usually incorporated into the venture-project. So, one or more emerging visions have their influence
on the central vision. This follows closely Filion's (1990) Entrepreneurship Metamodel.
Also what characterizes entrepreneurship processes is that (3) the unique idea needs to be communicated in order to
be realized (e.g. Westley, Mintzberg, 1989). Otherwise, the novel idea will never take more concrete forms. As
such, as the vision is diffused to the context, it brings the relation system into the picture: it attracts, stimulates and
motivates people around the project (Filion, 1990). Similarly, (4) the entrepreneur and the relation system need to

<-----Page 8----->organize resources so that something concrete could be established before the new business reality could emerge
out of these sub-processes and interactions. As a result, new organization starts to take more permanent form (e.g.
Gartner, 1985). Although the different sub-processes are presented in a sequential order, in reality it may be very
difficult to separate them from each other. The subprocesses are parallel and they affect each other. In a complex
process, there is not only one event or one thing, which is done or experienced by the participants. Instead, a
process is full of series of events, which have their own separate outcomes (Shaver and Scott 1991). It is a basic
human activity to bracket the continuous flow of experience of everyday life to make it more understandable. So, to
see the overall phenomenon as a result of several sub-processes makes the whole process more understandable.
Summary
From positivist point of view, the goal of the research is to search for regularities and test in order to predict and
control. According to subjectivism, the purpose of research is to describe and explain in order to diagnose and
understand. This paper claims that one should bridge between these two viewpoints in entrepreneurship research.
First, traditional views of theory building should be rejected. Theory building is essentially a theorizing process. By
using more subjectivist approaches we can produce rich descriptions of the phenomena that can serve as platforms
for more positivistic pattern and causality search and testing. As such, metaphorical transformation helps us to
bridge the subjectivist and positivistic research traditions.
Second, constructivism and structuration theory seems to offer a framework, which could combine different
research traditions into single framework. Instead of making a distinction between agent and structure,
constructivism takes them as a duality. As such, they have the potential to give quite realistic explanations of
human behavior in a social context.
Entrepreneurship research is a part of social sciences and a phenomenon. A potential entrepreneurship theory is
likely to be bounded by time and space. By using structuration theory and by seeing entrepreneurship as a
phenomenon of modem society, we could get deeper understanding of the underlying social mechanisms behind the
phenomenon. As such, our societies may foster entrepreneurial behavior when new knowledge becomes part of our
every day practices.
