MitigatingOperationalRisk in British
RetailBanks
KeithBlacker'
Thispaper extendstheriskmitigationphase of an establishedriskmanagementmodel,
using well-establisheddecision-makingtheories.Hence, a model is proposed of how
British retail banks may mitigate operational risks. The results of a case study are
presented as a basis for laying out in more detail a frameworkfor mitigation. The
paper presents an illustrativeexampleof an operationalriskproblem(pensionsmisselling), and of how it is being mitigated.
Key Words: Operational risk mitigation; decision-making; responsibility;
process; selection barriers; case study

Introduction
Thereis little academicresearchon operationalrisk managementandeven less on the mitigation
of operationalriskexposures.The overallaimof the researchreportedhereis to exploreoperational
risk mitigation in the context of British retail banks, and to propose a theoreticalframework
based on the emergingcore practiceof the banksunderstudy.
Following a brief review of the definition of operational risk, the paper describes a risk
managementmodel before moving into the detail of operationalrisk mitigation.By examining
operational risk mitigation in the context of well-established decision-making theory, a
theoretical frameworkis developed from which the main research question can be explored.
The preliminary results of the research (based on a single in-depth case study) are then
presented, together with some concluding remarksabout operational risk mitigation.
A brief case study of the British pensions mis-selling review is included in the paper. This
example, of an operationalrisk problemwhich has yet to be resolved, is concernedprincipally
with insurance companies. It has, however, affected many British retail banks because of
'bancassurance', the process of selling insurance products through bank branches, which
has existed in Britain since Lloyds Bank launched its own unit-linked insurance products in
1966.2 The case illustrates the mitigation tactics being employed to reduce the possibility of
this type of operational risk recurring.

Defining operational

risk

Operationalrisk is not a new phenomenon, although the term itself is a recent addition to the
financial services sector's risk management vocabulary. Currently,there is no commonly
agreed definition of operational risk.3 There is some consensus amongst practitionersthat it
involves a breakdown or failure in the operational processes within a bank.4 However,

definitions in the practitioners' literature abound, and it may be that there are as many
definitions of operationalrisk as there are banks. However, a 'core' definition, acceptable to
all parties but with sufficient flexibility to allow other types of risks to be included as
circumstances dictate, is slowly emerging. The increasingly conglomerate natureof British
retail banks, many of whom own insurance operations, has led supervisors (the Financial
Services Authority) to recognise that large losses could occur as a result of risk
concentrations at the group level.5 Operationalrisks can cut across different business units
or, in aggregate, threaten on-going business operations. Such risks need capturing as part
of the same risk management process, but with the focus at the conglomerate rather than
the business unit level.
Despite the variety of operational risk definitions that currently exist, it is evident that the
most importantfactor for banks (and other organisations) is the need to recognise that they
need to manage all their risks. This applies irrespective of the category of risk, whether
operational, market, credit, strategic or project. This point has recently been emphasised in
Britainby the publicationof the TurnbullReport.6The resultingCombinedCode on Corporate
Governanceobligates the directorsof listed companies to assess the risks to their organisation
on an on-going basis.
Whilst the researchreportedhere is not directly concerned with the definition of operational
risk, a clear understandingof what each bank includes within its definition is importantin
understandingthe approaches used to mitigate the operational risks involved. One of the
assumptions in the research is that the banks in question have definitions of operationalrisk
with common characteristics.

An operational risk management model
In considering how to manage operational risk, MacCrimmon and Wehrung7provide a
frameworkbased aroundthe three components of risk: the magnitude of loss, the chance of
loss and the exposure to loss. Managing (operational) risk requires the reduction of one or
more of these elements. This might involve building complex models, based on previous
risk exposures within the organisation (assuming the data can be captured),8 to enable
objective decision-making. However, it is more likely that any initial risk assessment will
be heavily subjective.
Risk managementis generallyidentifiedwith the following four phases:9
1. Risk identification: perceiving hazards, identifying failures, recognising adverse
consequences.
2. Risk estimation:estimatingrisk probabilities,describingthe risk, quantifyingthe risk.
3. Riskevaluation:estimatingthe impactof the risk,judgingacceptabilityof the risk,comparing
risks againstbenefits.
4. Riskmitigation:deciding on an appropriatecourse of action such as to lessen the impact,to
reducethe probabilityor to do both.
This frameworkis equally applicableto all types of risk exposure (including operationalrisk
management)within a bank, and is summarisedin Figure 1 opposite.

Risk mitigationinvolves makinga decision on whatto do aboutthe identifiedrisk.In this context,
the decision-makingprocess means 'making a choice' from a range of possible actions, rather
than 'solving a problem', since the problem has already been identified and analysed in the
previousphases of the model. This analysis and elements of decision-makingtheory'° allow the
derivationof an operationalrisk mitigationmodel (see Figure 2 below).

OThefour phases of the operationalrisk mitigationdecision-makingare:
1. Responsibility:who has responsibilityfor operationalrisk mitigation(not included in the
decision-makingmodel)?
2. Design: what tactics are employed to mitigateoperationalrisk exposures?
3. Choice: what is the process for selecting risk mitigationactions?
4. Implementation:what follow-up is carriedout to ensure that the risk has been effectively
mitigated?

Based on some preliminaryresearchand reflections,the model was furtherextended,to include
constraintson the choices availableto mitigatea particularoperationalrisk.The most obvious of
these constraintsrelateto the bank'seconomic environment-for example,the cost of mitigating
a risk is often a limiting factor.Anotherconstrainingfactor could be that the time requiredto
implementthe actionmay be thoughttoo long. The main functionalareasthatappearto have an
interestin operationalrisk mitigation(the responsibilityphase) have also been identified,as the
risk managementunit, the internalauditand the business unit's management.1When managers
have to decide on how best to mitigate operationalrisks, they normally have multiple risk
mitigationstrategiesavailableto them(the design phase).Horrigan,'2for example, identifiedsix
ways of controllingrisk situations:
1. Risk avoidance: makingthe occurrenceof the event impossible or extremelyunlikely.
2. Riskassumption:acceptingthe likelihoodof the occurrenceof the event, andundertakingno
mitigatingactions.
3. Riskreduction:reducingthe likelihood of the occurrenceand/orreducingthe eventualloss.
4. Risktransfer:acceptingthe likelihoodof the occurrenceof the eventbutreducingthe eventual
loss by transferringthe risk.
5. Hedging: mechanisms for hedging include using futures markets to hedge against the
possibility of the risk occurring,or diversifyingoperationsinto othercountries.
6. Combination:selecting a combinationof the above actions.
Managersthemselves also have theirown risk-takingbehaviourpatterns.'3In additionto these,
they must also take due cognisance of the natureof the operationalrisk being mitigated,the risk
appetiteof the business in which they work, and any otherconstraintsimposed upon them
Nutt'4 explored the decision selection process (the choice phase) in some detail. His analysis
identifiedfive main types:
1. Historical model: the decision-makerselects a provenprocedurefromthe practiceof others.
2. Off-the-shelf:the decision-makerselects the solution from a set of best ideas.
3. Appraisal:the decision-makerbegins with an idea thathas an unknownvalue and seeks to
implementit rationallyand top-down(at worst, this could involve imposing the solution).

Page 26

Keith Blacker

<-----Page 5----->Risk Management:An International Journal

4. Search:the decision-makerseeks a new solution, but needs help in deciding where to look.
5. Nova: the decision-makerseeks to implementan innovativesolution, and aims to challenge
acceptedpracticein the organisation.

Selecting and implementingthe tactic involves judgement on the part of the decision-maker,
althoughthe natureof the operationalrisk itself is highly influential.Operationalrisk exposures
that requirea minor improvementto the internalcontrol system are likely to be implemented
rapidly.Majorbusiness exposures,such as the Year2000 problem,requirecarefulplanningand
execution in orderto ensurethe efficacy of the tactic employed.
An effective follow-upprocess(the implementationphase)helps assess the qualityof the decision
made. This is equally so whetherthe mitigationaction is relatively simple, as in the case of an
improvementto the internalcontrolsystem, or complex, as in the case of the establishmentof a
projectteamfor the Year2000 problem.Thereis evidenceto suggestthatmanagerscan spendhalf
theirtime dealingwith the consequencesof baddecisions.15If thereis no follow-up then the bank
is deludedinto thinkingit has mitigatedan operationalrisk;the realityis thatit is still exposed.

Research method and data
The primarystrategyin the researchreportedhere is a qualitativeapproachusing exploratory
case studies,basedon structured
interviews;criticalincidenttechnique'6supportsthe datacollected
from interviews.This strategywas selected because the researchis exploratory'7and is seeking
to develop theoryin a new area.'8Earlierrisk managementresearchstudies concerningbanks'9
prove the validity of its applicationto the chosen subject.
Britishretailbankswere chosen since they representa largelyhomogenousgroup,althoughthey
may differin termsof size andbusinessfocus. However,the FSA regulatesthem all, andthey are
thus requiredto maintain similar general standardsof operation in their business activities,
includingrisk management.Additionally,they arelikely to have common operationalproblems.
The Bank of Englanddefines Britishretailbanks as banksthathave extensive branchnetworks
in Britainand thatparticipatein a Britishclearing system.20
Results presentedderive from the one detailed case completed to date, and caution is advised
with respectto theirinterpretation.The bankinvolved is one of the largestBritish-basedfinancial
services groups.Its businessesprovidea comprehensiverangeof bankingandfinancialservices
in the UK and overseas, and it ranksamongstthe top ten (by assets) in Britain.The remaining
case studies, when completed, will supply further data enabling cross-case analysis to be
undertaken,and so more general theoretical conclusions to be drawn about operationalrisk
mitigation.
Interviews were carriedout with a sample of senior managementfrom the risk management
function, the internalaudit departmentand business units.21In the instance of the case study
reportedhere, five senior managerswere involved, and this is expected to be the standardfor
furthercases.
The main instrumentis an open-endedquestionnaire.Since the area of study is within the last
phase of the risk managementmodel, it is anticipatedthat secondarydatais availableto support
the findings emergingfrom the main instrument;such secondarydataincludes auditreportsand
follow-up actions,internalmemos and risk managementreports.Wherepossible, use is made of

Findings
Responsibility
Responsibilityfor operationalrisk mitigation,as with the otherphases of risk management,rests
with business unit management. Senior management place constraints upon business unit
management,suchas policy guidelinesandbudgetarylimits, which may influencehow operational
risksaremitigated.This responsibilityis not 'shared'as such.However,thereis evidenceto support
the view that business unit managersrely (heavily, in some cases) on 'reservoirsof expertise'or
specialists,eitherinside or outsidethe organisation,when takinga decision on how to mitigatean
operationalrisk.Thesespecialistsmayhaveexpertisein internalaudit,riskmanagement,information
systems security,healthand safety or insurance;they may be eitherinternalspecialistsor external
consultants.
Wherean operationalriskspansa numberof businessunits,responsibilityis assignedto a 'relevant
manager'(a managerwho 'owns' the system involved). Forexample, where a numberof business
units used a common payments processing system supplied by a corporatefinance function, a
managerwithin the finance function would be the 'owner' of the risk.

Tactics
From the data collected thus far, the most favouredtactic for mitigatingoperationalrisks is risk
reduction.This was the case for the Year2000 problem,where companies who were proactivein
managing this risk organised their work around reducing the impact and the likelihood of it
happening.This reflects the natureof operationalrisk, which, dependingon the broadnessof the
definition used, will normally involve process improvements, introducing new technology,
tightening rules and developing contingency plans. These are all tactics that aim to reduce the
likelihood or impact of a risk-relatedevent.
Makingthe occurrenceof the event impossible or extremely unlikely (the avoidance tactic) may
be used when the operationalrisk is not automaticallypresent,but would be if a particularcourse
of actionwere chosen. Forexample,outsourcinga particularoperation,as well as having potential
benefits for the bank, also brings with it certainoperationalrisks. The possibility of the cost of
mitigating the risk outweighing the potential benefits involved is always a consideration.By
deciding not to use outsourcingthat particularrisk is always avoided.
The decision on whetherto assume an operationalrisk seems to be dependenton two types of
circumstance.The first is when the operationalrisk is outside the bank, and as a consequence
introducingan effective mitigationactionwould be too costly. An example of this, and one of the
main operationalrisks faced by British retail banks, is the heavy reliance placed on the central
FinancialTransactions
paymentsprocessingsystemrunby the SocietyforWorld-wideInternational
(SWIFT).Whilst SWIFThave theirown mitigationactions to cover inherentoperationalrisks, a
bankwould need its own paymentsroutingmechanismto protectitself fully, atthe extreme,against

Page 28

Keith Blacker

<-----Page 7----->Risk Management:An InternationalJournal

SWIFTfailing. Indeed,some banksarebeginningto considerthis as an optionin orderto reduce
the riskratherthanassumingit.
The second type of circumstanceis when one of the barriersto mitigatingthe risk is present,and
the risk is either consciously or subconsciously accepted. There is, of course, nothing wrong
with takingrisks, and banksthemselves have to take risks to make money.The issue is whether
the manager,when he acceptsthe risk,fully understandsthe potentialconsequencesof his action.
Recent work has illustratedthe benefits of having variouscontrolmechanismsin place to assist
managementin overcomingthis type of problem.23

Choice
In selecting a course of action, a business unit managermay need to consult with otherpeople as
partof the decision-makingprocess, for example:
*

when the cost of mitigatingan operationalrisk exceeds his/herexpenditurelimit;
* where improvementsare requiredfor control systems, which can only be carriedout by
personneloutside the manager'sbusiness unit (often informationsystems personnel);or

*

where the selected action involves a numberof personnel.

The natureof the operationalrisk againplays an importantpartin the final processused, andthis
in turnwould influence which of the five models identifiedby Nutt24would prevail.
Preliminaryresultssuggest thatoperationalrisks andtheirassociatedmitigationtactics correlate
closely. Minoroperationalrisks requirea simple selection process to effect the mitigationtactic.
Majoroperationalrisks requirethe initiationof formal procedures.Between these extremes, a
spectrumof operationalrisks exists, each with its own appropriatemitigationprocess. Several
elements of the selection process are likely to be common across the spectrum:
1. The startingpoint is always the operationalrisk in question, and the most practicalway of
approachingthe mitigationtactic.
2. The mitigatingaction requireddepends upon the amountof mitigationneeded to move the
risk to an 'acceptable'level.
3. The selection process may involve aligning prioritieswith otherbusiness unit objectives.
4. The selection process may involve negotiationsbetween the business unit and other parties
involved in mitigatingthe risk. This, in itself, would create an iterativeprocess before the
final selection is made.

Implementation
Follow-up proceduresto trackthe implementationof risk mitigationtactics vary. For example,
wherethe actioninvolves the establishmentof a projectteam,such as with theYear2000 problem,
then banksuse theirnormalprojectmanagementproceduresto monitorthe effectiveness of the
work. Where the action results from an internalaudit,then internalauditfollow-up procedures
would be used.

Keith Blacker

<-----Page 8----->Risk Management:An InternationalJournal

Whilstthe previousphasesof operationalriskmitigationwerereasonablywell definedandclearly
visible, thereappearsto be less formalityin the implementationphase.Therecould be a number
of reasonsfor this:
* Wherea cultureof personalempowermentexists, thereare fewer tendenciesto controlthe
(operationalrisk mitigation)work assigned to individuals.
* Implementationis a process that may relate more to humanbehaviourthan to technical
considerations.2 Where an action involves a change in the working practices of all
employees, follow-up proceduresmay rely on other staff 'whistle-blowing', instead of
detailed internalcontrol procedures(eg, the personaluse--and associated risks--of the
Internetwhilst at work).
Operationalrisk managementunits which assume responsibilityfor establishingdetailed
policies and proceduresfor operationalrisk managementare still in the early stages of
development

.26

* When mitigatingcomplex operationalrisks, the progressionthroughthe risk management
and risk mitigationmodels does not necessarilyoccur in a linearmanner.Risk mitigation
may be an iterativeprocess, involveing a numberof attemptsat implementation.At each
stage the tactic may be revised and 're-implemented'.

Barriers
There are a numberof emergingthemes identifiedas barriersto mitigatingoperationalrisks:

1. High cost or large resource requirementsare the most predominantbarriers.Where such
issues cannotbe resolved, a risk is normallyaccepted.
2. Inertia involves personnel not wanting to adaptto new procedures,difficulty in changing
mindsets, and obstinacy.Managementattitudesare significant here, and the message that
comes down from the boardis crucialin establishingthe attitudethat will filter down to the
otherorganisationallevels.
3. No solution either implies that an appropriatetechnical solution is not yet possible or, to a
lesser degree, thatthere are difficulties in implementingan appropriatetechnical solution.
4. Ignorance implies a general lack of risk awarenessamongstbusiness unit staff, which can
also affect the identificationof operationalrisks.
Whilst these are barriersto effective mitigation,they are also opportunitiesto improvethe way
the business operates.Raising awarenessof risk managementthrougheffective traininghelps to
overcome some of the inertiaand to make staff more risk-conscious.Understandingthe culture
of the organisation('the way things are done aroundhere') looks to be an importantfactor in
gaining commitmentto mitigatingan operationalrisk exposure.

Discussion
Preliminaryfindings from this researchproject indicate that the mitigationof operationalrisk
exposuresinvolves a complex series of interactionsbetween people, processes and technology.
The proposedmodel for mitigatingoperationalrisk, which is firmly rooted in decision-making

Page 30

Keith Blacker

<-----Page 9----->Risk Management: An International Journal

theory,illustratesthis interaction,with many of the steps taken to mitigate an operationalrisk
involving people using technology to enhance controlprocesses. Furtherfieldwork will reveal
whetheror not it is appropriateto make theoreticalgeneralisationsfrom the model.
Like all the otherstages in the risk managementmodel, riskmitigationis not a 'one-off' process.
Operationalrisks arefluid, and change accordingto a host of factors.The much cited Year2000
problemis a classic operationalrisk, which only assumedimportanceover the last few years of
the century.The first day of January2000 is now history,as are all attemptsto mitigatethis risk.
Any remainingproblemsexist only because effective mitigationwas not undertakenin the first
place; mitigationhas thus moved from being proactiveto reactive.
By organisingandcollectingthe dataarounda theoreticallysoundframework,the aim is to identify
emergingcore practicein operationalrisk management,with specific emphasison the mitigation
phase.Initialresearchfindingsinto operationalriskmitigationin Britishretailbankssuggestthata
numberof factorsneed to be consideredwhen selectingan appropriatemitigationstrategy:
*

What is the natureof the operationalrisk involved?
* How does the risk measureup in termsof likelihood and impact?
* Who needs to be involved in mitigatingthe operationalrisk?
* How much will the mitigatingaction cost in terms of time and resources?
* How long will it take to implementthe mitigatingaction?

Case study: British pensions mis-selling

27

In 1988, the personalpension provisions of the Social SecurityAct 1986 came into force in the
UK. This allowed employees to save for retirementthemselves instead of joining either an
employer-sponsoredor the government-sponsoredpension scheme. Between 1988 and 1994,
more thanfive million personalpensions were sold. By 1992, it was clear thatmany people had
boughta personalpension when this was likely to have been to theirdisadvantage.The scale and
complexityof theproblemmeantthatthegovernment,theregulatorsandthecompaniesthemselves
all became involved in subsequentevents. These events led to a complete review of all such
pension plans sold (around650,000) since 1988, with compensationpaymentsmade where the
customerwas found to be worse off.

Whatwere the operationalrisks involved?
The chief benefit of hindsightis that it is easy to be wise aboutthe operationalrisks that were
either not identified or identified and ignored, ie, no appropriatemitigating action was taken.
However, in this case the importantoperationalrisks seem to have been:
* The companies involved did not comply with regulatoryrules concerningsales of these
types of products.
* The regulator'schecks on these types of sales were ineffective.
* Manyof the salesmeninvolvedreliedheavily on commission-drivensales for theirincome.

Keith Blacker

Page 31

<-----Page 10----->Risk Management:An International Journal

* Therewas an emphasison producingquantityratherthanqualityof business.
* Supervisorycontrolswithintheorganisations
wereineffectivein detectinginappropriate
sales.
The introductionof personalpensions was widely publicised. Unfortunately,it was unclearat
the time that a large proportionof those with extant pension arrangementswould benefit from
not transferring.This could certainly have contributedto the 'operational environment' in
which these productswere being sold. Another importantoperationalrisk to emerge has been
the reputationalrisk of the companies involved, as well as that of the whole industry sector.
Only time will tell if public confidence in pension providershas been permanentlydented by
this debacle.

Mitigatingthe risks involved
Much of the pensions mis-selling review was concernedwith correctingthe mistakes that had
been made, and with ensuringthatindividualcustomerswere not worse off now thanthey would
have been withouta personalpension. Manycompanieshave set up pensionreview departments
to tacklethis task.In the meantime,businessunitmanagersremainresponsiblefor mitigatingthe
operationalrisks involved in selling personalpension plans.The involvementof so many highprofile players should shortly lead to the imposition of mitigatingactions on the business unit
managers.Forexample,theTreasurySelect Committeestronglyrecommendedgiving increasing
power to the FSA.28This involves ensuringthatthe FSA has the ability to enforce its regulation
of the financial services sector (includingbanks)effectively and examining ways to reducethe
excessive dependenceon commission-basedselling. Risk reductionis the focus of these tactics,
and specifically reducingthe probabilityof the event recurring.
The final piece of the jigsaw relates to the mitigatingactions of the companies themselves. In
additionto the FSA's drive, this researchsuggests thatthe companiesthemselves are also using
risk reductionas theirmain tactic. Steps include:
* improvingthe sales trainingprocess for pension products;
* enhancingmonitoringprocedures;and
* improvingthe communicationof informationto the public on pensions.
The estimated cost of this review and the subsequent compensation is £11 billion. The social
cost too is considerable. It is one example of an operational risk that cannot be allowed to
happen again.
