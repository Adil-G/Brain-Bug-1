Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure and
the Self-Compassion to Learn from the Experience

abstract Project failure is likely to generate a negative emotional response for those involved
in the project. But do all people feel the same way? And are some better able to regulate
their emotions to learn from the failure experience? In this paper we develop an emotion
framework of project failure that relies on self-determination to explain variance in the
intensity of the negative emotions triggered by project failure and self-compassion to explain
variance in learning from project failure. We discuss the implications of our model for research
on entrepreneurial and innovative organizations, employees’ psychological ownership, and
personal engagement at work.

INTRODUCTION
Projects are regularly created and terminated within entrepreneurial organizations. By
projects we mean new ventures, new products, new services, entering new markets,
and/or implementing new processes. For example, ‘seventy percent of Nokia’s new
ventures were either discontinued or entirely divested [between 1998 and 2002].
Another 21% were absorbed into existing business units and ceased to exist as independent ventures’ (McGrath et al., 2006, p. 51). Biotechnology organizations are highly
dependent upon the creation of new drugs (Deeds and DeCarolis, 2000; Rothaermel
and Deeds, 2004), yet ‘while a typical R&D process lasts up to 13 years, only one out of
10,000 substances becomes a marketable product’ (Gassmann and Reepmeyer, 2005, p.
233). Projects to take existing products to new markets can fail (Li, 1995) as can proposed
process innovations (Iacovoc and Dexter, 2005), new ventures (Sminia, 2003), and
alliances (White, 2005). For example, one study found that half of all information systems
projects in the USA in 1995 failed and these failures cost $140 billion (Keil and Robey,
1999). Although costly, these project failures provide individuals and organizations an
opportunity to learn from the experience (Hammad, 2003; McGrath, 1999).

Project failure is the termination of a project due to the realization of unacceptably
low performance as operationally defined by the project’s key resource providers
(Shepherd et al., 2009) and can be viewed as a trigger that prompts new behaviours
and thoughts and stirs emotions in both employees and managers (Kiefer, 2005), particularly negative emotions (Fisher, 2000; Huy, 2002; Kiefer, 2005).[1] For example,
Murray (2006) asserted that ‘a decision to scrap a project in any stage of its development is going to create a more intense negative reaction and concerted resistance
within the project team and the business units affected, and possibly within senior
management’. A negative emotional reaction is when an event causes an individual’s
core affect to become negative (Seo et al., 2004) in response to the project failure.
These negative emotions can lead organizational members to overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes and to underestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes
for subsequent projects (Nygren et al., 1996), as well as become more risk averse
(Lerner and Keltner, 2001). Furthermore, these negative emotions can impact attitudes
and behaviours (George and Jones, 2001; Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996) that decrease
trust and commitment towards the organization, increase turnover intentions and work
slowdowns (e.g. Kiefer, 2005; Patterson and Cary, 2002; Schweiger and De Nisi,
1991), as well as hinder the process of learning from the failure experience (Shepherd,
2003, 2009; Shepherd et al., 2009). Although project failure represents an opportunity
to learn from the experience, many people involved with project failures do not do so
(Disterer, 2002; Garvin, 1993).
Given these implications of negative emotions generated from project failure, it is
important to understand why some project failures generate a more intense negative
emotional reaction than others. It is also important to understand why some individuals’
negative emotional reactions have a more detrimental impact on subsequent learning
than do others. To address these issues we develop a framework of project failure
building on self-determination to explain the intensity of the negative emotional reactions and build on the notion of self-compassion to explain regulation of these emotions
to more effectively learn from the failure. In doing so, we believe that we make four
primary contributions.
First, scholars of entrepreneurship, strategy and organizational change have often
approached change as a problem to be solved, such as with a rational multi-step
process (e.g. unfreezing, moving, refreezing (Vince and Broussine, 1996), or a strategic
issue that can be optimized (Kotter and Schlesinger, 1979). While scholars have begun
to investigate which organizational changes are likely to generate emotions – e.g. dissolution of production teams (Cox, 1997) or movement to shared governance models
(Bartunek et al., 2006), they have not yet explored the heterogeneity across individuals
in the level of negative emotions triggered from a project failure and heterogeneity in
their ability to regulate those emotions. We focus on the varying intensity of negative
emotions generated by project failure across members of the same project team and
across projects for a particular organizational member to explain learning from the
failure experience.
Second, research on project failure has focused on the reasons for this outcome (e.g.
lack of innovativeness from, for example, lack of social cohesion in the team (Sethi et al.,
2001), inappropriate allocation of scarce resources (Dillon et al., 2003), or incomplete

market research (Hill, 1988)) and has acknowledged the need for learning from project
failure (e.g. Sethi and Iqbal, 2008) but has provided little explanation of the heterogeneity in employees’ abilities to learn from a specific project failure experience. Our model
offers such an explanation. However, rather than addressing how to solve the problem of
emotions by attempting to eliminate them, we take a self-compassion perspective to
explain how individuals differ in their ability to regulate these negative emotions to learn
from the failure experience. We draw on the literature on coping and compassion to
address when and how people deal effectively, or less effectively, with personally important work failures.
Third, recent research has focused on cognitive strategies for managing the negative
emotions triggered by failure (Shepherd, 2003, 2009; Shepherd et al., 2009). Although
this research has made an important contribution, it assumes a negative emotional
reaction and does not offer an explanation for why people vary in the extent of their
emotional reaction to failure (across people and within individuals across projects). In this
paper we offer such an explanation. Further, rather than focusing on a cognitive strategy
to manage emotions (such as the dual process model of oscillating orientations (Shepherd, 2003)), in this paper we investigate how self-compassion influences the relationship
between the negative emotions of project failure and learning from the experience.
Self-compassion is different from, but likely complementary to, cognitive strategies for
managing emotions.
Finally, we seek to contribute to the growing literature on positive organizational
psychology. This research stream focuses on positive aspects of organizational life that
‘lead to the development of human strength, foster vitality and flourishing in employees, make possible resilience and restoration, and cultivate extraordinary individual
and organizational performance’ (Bernstein, 2003, p. 266), rather than the more
typical focus on negative aspects such as competitiveness and greed. Constructs of
interest in this literature stream include those often neglected in organizational
research, such as ‘compassion, resilience, forgiveness, courage, and positive emotions’
(Bernstein, 2003, p. 266). To date this literature has focused on interpersonal positivity
in organizations. We contribute by focusing on positive aspects of organizational life
taking an intrapersonal perspective. Although the trigger to positivity is a negative
emotional reaction to project failure, our focus on self-compassion and self-forgiveness
subsequent to such failure fits well within a positive organizational scholarship framework. As Dutton and Sonenshein (2009) argued, from a positive organizational scholarship (POS) perspective, negative states may be important for explaining the
flourishing or the cultivation of strengths. For example, Sutcliffe and Vogus (2003)
showed that negative setbacks are critical to the development of resilience. Consistent
with such an approach, we emphasize the capability of individuals to learn following
the negative emotional reaction triggered by project failures; we take a positive perspective on a negative event.
This paper proceeds as follows. First, we develop the self-determination aspect of our
model to explain the intensity of the negative emotional reaction to project failure.
Second, we develop the self-compassion aspect of our model to explain variance in the
relationship between these negative emotions and learning from failure. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our model.

EMOTIONAL REACTION TO PROJECT FAILURE AND THE
SELF-COMPASSION TO LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE
Our model is illustrated in Figure 1. In the centre of the model is the intensity of the
negative emotional reaction to project failure. The intensity of the negative emotional
reaction to project failure depends on the importance of the project to the organizational
member. The negative emotional reaction is proposed to be more intense, the more that
the project failure creates a decrease in psychological well-being (PWB) (because it
thwarts the needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy). Although negative emotions can highlight the importance of the project to encourage scanning for new information, negative emotions interfere with the learning process. The extent to which it
interferes with an individual’s learning from the failure depends on his or her selfcompassion. The greater his or her self-compassion (self-kindness, common humanity
and mindfulness), the less interference a given level of negative emotions will have on
learning from the failure experience. Those with greater self-compassion will also face
fewer obstacles to the motivation to try again. In the sections that follow we develop each
aspect of the model.

The Intensity of the Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure
In an organization, employees often develop feelings of psychological ownership (Pierce
et al., 2001) for projects, people, or events where they feel they have control over the
object, deep knowledge of the object, and where they have invested heavily of themselves

<-----Page 4----->Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure

927

in terms of time, effort, and energy in the object. Such feelings of psychological ownership can lead to employees’ self-identities being intertwined with the identities of the
project and the project team. As resources are deployed from a failed project, the project
team is likely broken up and redeployed to other tasks resulting in the loss of close
relationships. In such a case, project failure can lead to a loss of part of a member’s
self-identity, which can have dysfunctional or even pathological consequences (Pierce
et al., 2001).
There are numerous examples of project failure that occur in organizations that
generate negative emotions among its members (e.g. bitter disappointment (Cunningham, 2004); the low point of my career (Eggen and Witte, 2006); and emotional
devastation (Dillon, 1998)). However, do all project failures generate a negative emotional reaction? Is there variability in the level of negative emotions triggered by project
failure? We use a self-determination theory perspective to develop a model of the
negative emotional reactions to project failure because a self-determination theory perspective (a) is focused on psychological well-being of individuals, which has been linked
to emotions, (b) focuses on criteria for importance driven by the nature of the individual’s
context, and (c) has been extensively investigated in the organizational setting. Psychological well-being ‘refers to the extent to which an individual experiences self-acceptance,
positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and
personal growth’ (Ryff, 1989).
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is concerned with explicating the psychological
processes that promote optimal functioning and health (Deci and Ryan, 2000, p. 262;
Ryan and Deci, 2000), and thus PWB. An individual’s environment provides the level
of nutriments for three needs that are associated with PWB. To the extent that these
needs are not satisfied there is a decrease in PWB. It is important to note that the
satisfaction of these needs varies between individuals and within individuals across
projects (Sheldon et al., 1996). The three psychological needs are for competence,
relatedness and autonomy. Individuals are motivated to perform well on those projects
that satisfy these psychological needs. Indeed such a motivation can be categorized as
intrinsic motivation because it involves active engagement with tasks that an individual
finds interesting and that in turn promotes psychological growth (Deci and Ryan,
2000).
Although projects that satisfy individuals’ needs for competence, autonomy, and
relatedness will generate greater levels of intrinsic motivation than projects that satisfy
these needs to a lesser extent, they will also generate more intense negative emotional
reactions when they fail.[2] This notion of the importance of a project based on the extent
to which it satisfied these psychological needs is consistent with prior research on
commitment through psychological ownership and personal engagement at work. Psychological ownership is when an individual feels that a particular project or other target
belongs to them, such that an identity bonding between the individual and project has
occurred and meaning and emotion associated with possessiveness and ownership exists,
even though the individual has no legal claim over the project (Pierce et al., 2001).
Similarly, personal engagement is the idea of how much people bring in their personal
selves to their work roles (Kahn, 1990) and the extent to which there is ‘the simultaneous
employment and expression of a person’s preferred self in task behaviours that promote

<-----Page 5----->928

connections to work and to others, personal presence, and active, full role performances’
(Kahn, 1990, p. 700). Major aspects of psychological ownership are autonomy and
relatedness, and major aspects of personal engagement are relatedness and competence,
referred to by Kahn (1990) as meaningfulness, which arises from people feeling worthwhile, useful, and valuable when engaging in an activity. These literatures suggest that
when projects fulfil individuals’ needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence, individuals are more inclined to develop feelings of psychological ownership of the projects,
and are more inclined to be personally engaged in their work. As such, greater levels of
psychological ownership and personal engagement in a project are likely to lead to more
intense negative emotional reactions when the project fails. Each of the psychological
needs is explored.
Project failure, a thwarted need for competence, and intensity of negative emotional reaction. The
importance of a project to an individual is partly dependent on the extent to which it
satisfies the psychological need for competence and once it has been lost, this need
remains unsatisfied (thwarted). A psychological need for competence ‘is satisfied when
feedback provides information to the individual about their high performance at a task’
and a psychological need for competence is thwarted when feedback provides information of poor performance (Deci and Ryan, 2000). There is a substantial body of evidence
from the motivation literature that links tasks that satisfy needs for competence and
motivation towards those tasks (Fisher, 1978; McMullen and Shepherd, 2006; Vallerand
and Reid, 1984). Projects can satisfy an organizational member’s need for competence
for several reasons.
First, a project may provide experiences that enhance learning (Dweck, 1986) and
build feelings of mastery (Butler, 1992). Feelings of mastery indicate the development of
competence (Rawsthorne and Elliot, 1999). Second, a project team’s culture can help
satisfy a need for competence; constructive competition within or across project teams
can be a source for confirming an employee’s competence (Tjosvold et al., 2003). Third,
possessing membership in a group can satisfy psychological needs for competence. A
group itself can develop confidence in its competence (Gist, 1987; Lindsley et al., 1995)
that is highly valued by its members and be a source of a group member’s self-identity
(Tajfel and Turner, 1979, 1986).
Therefore, there is likely a decrease in PWB when an employee: (1) loses a project
where he or she feels they are learning important skills and/or where they believe they
have high task specific competence; (2) loses a project team culture that maintains
constructive competition and is replaced by a climate of destructive competition with
others unsupportive of one’s efforts; or (3) loses membership in a group by being
reassigned to a different, less competent group. Specifically, a change in group membership can be perceived as a loss of a key component to the employee’s identity,
diminishing his or her sense of competence and self-worth (Steele, 1988). When these
possessions are lost with project failure and not fully replaced by, say a subsequent
project, the psychological need for competence is thwarted, triggering a negative emotional reaction. Projects likely differ to the extent that they satisfy the need for competence and therefore differ to the extent to which they thwart this need when they
fail.

Project failure, a thwarted need for autonomy, and intensity of negative emotional reaction. The
importance of a project is also influenced by the extent to which a project satisfies the
psychological need for autonomy. Autonomy ‘refers to personal control and at work
provides employees the ability to decide when, where and how the job is to be done’
(Bailyn, 1993; Thompson and Prottas, 2006). Projects differ to the extent that they
provide employees with greater autonomy. That is, individuals value more those things
for which they have personal control and less those things that are controlled more
externally. Managers can provide organizational members autonomy with a project
through empowerment (Logan and Ganster, 2007; Lok et al., 2005), low formal structure
(O’Driscoll et al., 2006), job design, participative decision making, sound learning and
self-management (Liden and Tewksbury, 1995; Seibert et al., 2004). They can also
provide autonomy through structures and processes (Bennis and Nanus, 1985), such as
those that promote information sharing, autonomous action, and that have teams as the
locus of decision making authority (Blanchard et al., 1995; Seibert et al., 2004). Contexts
that provide individuals with greater autonomy have been found to be associated with an
enhanced well-being (Deci et al., 1981, 1989), job satisfaction (Hackman and Oldham,
1980; Purasuraman and Alutto, 1984) and lower levels of stress (Purasuraman and
Alutto, 1984; Thompson and Prottas, 2006). In contrast, rewards and evaluations that
undermine autonomy while engaged in an activity have been found to decrease creativity
(Amabile, 1982), complex problem solving (McGraw and McCullers, 1979) and deep
conceptual processing of information (Deci and Ryan, 2000).
The management and organizational systems, processes and structures that promote
the satisfaction of a project team member’s needs for autonomy can change when the
associated project fails. For example, management’s termination of a project can be
perceived as threatening the member’s sense of control (Dirks et al., 1996), which is
especially problematic if team members have identified themselves with, or feel psychological ownership of, the project (Pierce et al., 2001). When organizations radically alter or
cancel projects for which members felt they had control over, the members may experience loss, frustration, and stress (Bartunek, 1993; Pierce et al., 2001). Therefore, the failure
of a project can thwart the satisfaction of the need for autonomy, generating a negative
emotional reaction. Work projects likely differ to the extent that they satisfy the need for
autonomy and therefore differ to the extent to which they thwart this need when they fail.
Project failure, a thwarted need for relatedness, and intensity of negative emotional reaction. The
importance of a project is also likely influenced by the extent to which it satisfies the
psychological need for relatedness. Relatedness ‘refers to feeling connected to, and
understood by, others’ (Patrick et al., 2007). For example, it has been empirically found
that individuals are more motivated when their context is characterized by a sense of
secure relatedness (Ryan and La Guardia, 2000; Ryan et al., 1994). Indeed, there is
considerable evidence that individuals have a need to feel related to others and act in a
way to satisfy that need. Individuals have been found to experience positive affect from
increases in relatedness to others in a group (McAdams, 1985; McAdams and Bryant,
1987) and negative affect when this relatedness is lacking (Leary, 1990); negative affect
such as anxiety (Baumeister and Tice, 1990; Craighead et al., 1979), loneliness (Russell
et al., 1984) and negative physical and psychological well-being (DeLongis et al., 1988).

<-----Page 7----->930

D. A. Shepherd and M. S. Cardon

Projects provide organizational members opportunities to satisfy the need to feel
related. This is achieved by, for example, supervisor and/or co-worker support (Caverley
et al., 2007; Thompson and Prottas, 2006), identifying with a group within the organization (Richter et al., 2006), and/or identifying with the organization (Ashforth, 2001;
Barker and Tomkins, 1994). Project failure can lead to the loss of a particular supervisor
or co-worker relationship, thwarting the need for relatedness (cf. Vince and Broussine,
1996). This loss and change associated with project failure can undermine attachments
employees have with other individuals, which previously provided them a basic framework for meaning and relatedness (Marris, 1986; Vince and Broussine, 1996), and thus
enhanced their psychological well-being. For example, PWB is lower among employees
that have less supportive team members and managers (Gilbreath and Benson, 2004).
It also appears that PWB is reduced when an employee’s identity is threatened by
project failures that disband his or her team and redeploy these previous team members
across other groups throughout the organization. This threat to identity is particularly
strong for those employees that feel that the work group was an extension of the self (Belk,
1988; Dittmar, 1992). When the project fails, the threat to social identity thwarts the
need for relatedness and generates a negative response (Aquino and Douglas, 2003;
DeLongis et al., 1988). Projects likely differ to the extent that they satisfy the need for
relatedness and therefore differ to the extent to which they thwart this need when they
fail.
In sum, organizational members, as all people, have a psychological need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Projects likely differ to the extent that they satisfy these
needs and therefore differ to the extent to which they thwart these needs when they fail.
The more these needs are thwarted the more intense the negative emotional reaction to
the project failure. Thus:
Proposition 1: Failure of projects that had satisfied an organizational member’s need for
(a) competence, (b) autonomy and (c) relatedness more will generate a more intense
negative emotional reaction than does the failure of projects that had satisfied the need
for competence, autonomy and relatedness less.
NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND LEARNING
Negative emotions have been found to interfere with individuals’ ability to process
information (Mogg et al., 1990; Wells and Matthews, 1994), which is necessary for
learning. This is not to suggest that emotions do not have some learning benefits – they
do. For example, negative emotions signal that something important is in jeopardy or
been lost (Luce et al., 1997), which can be beneficial by directing attention and resources
to the event (Clore, 1992; Pieters and Raaij, 1988; Schwarz and Clore, 1988). This
allocation of attention is necessary for the scanning and information processing required
to learn (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Weick, 1979) and to motivate change (Lazarus, 1993).
However, as stated above, negative emotions can also interfere with learning. Negative
emotions can narrow the scanning for information (Gladstein and Reilly, 1985; Staw
et al., 1981; Sutton and D’Aunno, 1989) and interfere with the processing of that
information (Matthews et al., 1990). Negative emotions can also divert scarce informa© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009

<-----Page 8----->Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure

931

tion processing capacity from the event to the emotions generated by the event
(Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991). The learning benefits of negative emotions are
outweighed by its costs for more complex tasks (Huber, 1985).
The desired benefits of learning from project failure occur when the organizational
member compares the project’s performance (where it failed) with the original plans on
that dimension of the task to increase understanding of the nature of the performance
gap and hopefully the reason for the failure (McGrath, 1999, p. 23). Learning often
involves repeating whatever strategies, routines, or practices have been successful in the
current, or other, organizations (e.g. vicarious learning; Kim and Miner, 2007). Learning
can occur equally well (or better; Sitkin, 1992) from studying failures, in particular,
because failures encourage the search for new actions or new business models or routines
(Kim and Miner, 2007; Miner et al., 1999). When learning after project failure is
effective, it can provide the organization with information about their assumptions
(about product favourability, strategic direction, etc) that can help them make better
decisions going forward (McGrath, 1999). Thus learning in the context of project failure
involves understanding the causes of the failure, testing out key assumptions which
guided the project that failed to see if they are worthy of retaining or need to be altered,
and developing capabilities to change the processes, strategies, procedures, or actions
that led to the failure. More specifically, although project failure within organizations
provides valuable learning opportunities (Corbett et al., 2008; McGrath, 1999; Sitkin,
1992), when these failures are emotionally painful they are less likely to be discussed and
learning from these experiences is compromised (McGrath, 1999; Shepherd, 2009;
Shepherd et al., 2009).
Just as we expect variance in the level of an individual’s negative emotions generated across project failures and across team members for a particular project failure,
we also expect variance in the way individuals respond to that negative emotional
reaction. More specifically, the question is why some individuals are better able to
overcome the negative emotional interference to learning from the failure experience
than others. We explore learning from project failure by proposing that self-regulation
(specifically self-compassion) is a moderator to the relationship between the level of
negative emotions experienced in reaction to a project failure and learning from the
experience. Based on the insights of social psychology and the literature on failure, we
investigate how various attributes of self-compassion can facilitate individuals’ learning
from project failure.
SELF-COMPASSION DYNAMICS AND LEARNING FROM FAILURE
There is an extensive literature on how individuals respond to negative emotions,
including work on emotion regulation, coping, and compassion. In general, emotional
regulation involves individuals’ attempts to influence which emotions they have, when
they have them, and how they are experienced or expressed (Gross, 1998). Emotion
regulation may lead to better psychological health because it may decrease the stress of
what may otherwise cause a loss of psychological well-being (e.g. Frijda, 1988; Seligman,
1991).[3] Gross (1998) argued that there are two primary forms of emotion regulation, one
focused on manipulating the inputs to the emotional system, such as by preventing the

<-----Page 9----->932

triggering of the emotion or diminishing the level of emotion triggered (antecedentfocused emotion regulation), and one focused on manipulating the outputs of the emotional system, such as by suppressing the emotional response tendencies once the
emotion has already been generated (response-focused emotion regulation). Antecedent
focused regulation can occur in many ways, such as through approaching or avoiding
certain situations based on their likely emotional impact, turning attention towards or
away from certain things to change the emotions one experiences, and cognitive change
where an individual re-evaluates either the situation or his or her capacity to manage the
situation (Gross, 1998). In the case of project failure, antecedent-focused emotion regulation could involve reappraising the failure to decrease its emotional relevance to the
individual, such as by convincing oneself the project did not provide competence,
relatedness, or autonomy.
Response-focused emotion regulation can also occur in many ways. Such regulation
does not change the subjective experience of the emotion (in this case, a negative one),
but would involve what the individual does once they experience the negative emotion
from project failure. We anticipate that individuals experiencing negative emotions will
likely want to diminish or curtail the experience of such emotions and the associated
expression of, and physiological responses to, them. They might do this through distracting themselves from the negative emotion or by trying to find another project that
satisfies their needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy. While reappraisal and
other forms of antecedent-focused emotion regulation are often preferable to responsefocused emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) because, for example, suppression of negative
emotions typically involves high levels of personal strain (Côté, 2005), it is not always
possible to prevent oneself from experiencing the emotion. This is consistent with our
arguments above that projects that do thwart an individual’s needs for competence,
relatedness, and autonomy will generate greater negative emotional reactions, because
the failure of the project has emotional relevance to the individual.
A second literature that addresses how individuals respond to negative emotions is in
the area of compassion. Perceived social support from others is associated with positive
well-being of individuals, and organizations can be places where compassion is given and
received (Kanov et al., 2004). Such compassion may range from empathetic listening to
others’ troubles (Frost, 2003), feeling sympathy (Carlo et al., 1999; Struthers et al., 2004),
and to full-scale responses to unexpected traumatic events (Dutton et al., 2006). Compassion is largely viewed as a positive and influential force in organizations (Kanov et al.,
2004). Interestingly, compassion in organizations has been studied at a variety of levels
of analysis, including individual compassion for others (Nussbaum, 1996), compassion as
a relational process occurring through connections between people (Kanov et al., 2004),
and how individuals come together in providing a coordinated compassionate response
at an organizational level of analysis (e.g. compassion organizing (Dutton et al., 2006)
and emotional capability (Huy, 1999)[4]). Across these levels, however, the definition and
components of compassion are fairly consistent. Compassion is an expression of an
innate human instinct to respond to the suffering of others to alleviate that suffering,
where that suffering includes the experience of pain or loss that threatens a person’s sense
of meaning about their own existence (Dutton et al., 2006; Reich, 1989). Thus in this
way compassion is a response to a threat to a person’s self-meaning or psychological

well-being. In addition, compassion involves responding to another’s suffering, so
includes action, not just emotion (Dutton et al., 2006).
Just as compassion for others involves noticing, feeling, and responding to another’s
suffering (Dutton et al., 2006), self-compassion involves ‘self-awareness that one is
experiencing a sense of loss, determination of the source of that loss feeling (in this case,
project failure), and intention to respond to the loss by doing something about it’. A
self-compassionate individual is touched by one’s own suffering generated from project
failure, is aware of one’s own pain and desires to alleviate this suffering by healing oneself
rather than avoiding or disconnecting from the source of the suffering (Neff, 2003a;
Wispe, 1991). With self-compassion the individual seeks to remain connected to organizational action. Self-compassion is somewhat different from compassion for others, in
that the relational process of compassion (Kanov et al., 2004) occurs through the interaction and relationship one has with oneself. We describe three dynamics involved with
self-compassion (self-kindness, common humanity and mindfulness) and link them to (1)
the intensity of the negative emotional reaction to project failure, and (2) the moderation
of the relationship between negative emotions and learning from failure.
Our approach makes a number of assumptions. First, self-compassion can be learned
and develops over time. There is empirical evidence to support this assumption (Neff,
2003b; Shapiro et al., 2005). Second, self-compassion represents a necessary (but not
sufficient) condition for individuals to learn from project failure. Finally, while we assume
that the disparate literature stream we use to develop our model (Buddhist philosophy,
psychology, and education) is relevant, we also build our argument in concert with
more conventional organizational motivation and learning literatures by offering a
compassion-based, conceptual foundation for explaining why learning from project
failure is so difficult to realize and how such difficulties might be attenuated.
Self-Compassion, Negative Emotions, and Learning from Project Failure
Self-compassion involves being caring towards oneself in the face of hardship or perceived inadequacy (Bennett-Goleman, 2001; Brach, 2003; Hanh, 1997; Neff, 2004),
which, in the context of the current research, is in the face of project failure. It involves
being touched by one’s own suffering, being aware of one’s own pain and desiring to
alleviate one’s suffering by healing oneself rather than by avoiding or disconnecting from
the source of suffering (adapted from Wispe (1991) consistent with Neff (2003a)). In
demonstrating self-compassion, individuals are less anxious about negative events and
are able to maintain increased psychological well-being (Neff, 2004).
Our focus is on the self-regulatory mechanisms that seek to address or overcome
threats triggered by project failure and that enhance the ability to learn from failure. In
the model we propose that individuals that show caring to oneself in assessing project
failure (self-kindness), place project failure in perspective with others (common humanity)
and keep emotions in balance (mindfulness), generate less of a negative emotional
reaction to project failure and are better able to use project failure as an opportunity to
learn. In the next sub-section we describe these exemplars of self-compassion that help
individuals self-regulate their negative emotional reaction to project failure in a way that
is conducive to learning from the experience. Our purpose here is not to offer an

exhaustive list of mechanisms by which individuals promote self-kindness, common
humanity and mindfulness, but to suggest that such mechanisms likely exist and are
important in explaining why some individuals experience weaker negative emotional
reactions to project failure and why some individuals are better able to learn from the
failure experience.
Self-kindness, negative emotions, and learning from project failure. Self-kindness ‘refers to
extending caring and understanding to oneself rather than harsh judgment and selfcriticism (Neff, 2003a, p. 89) after project failure’. Self-kindness is demonstrated, in part,
when an individual (a) tries to understand and be patient towards those aspects of oneself
that he or she does not like, (b) is caring to oneself when experiencing suffering from
project failure, (c) gives oneself the tenderness needed when going through the hard times
associated with project failure, (d) tolerates one’s own flaws and inadequacies that lead to
project failure, and (e) tries to be loving towards oneself when feeling emotional pain over
project failure (cf. Neff, 2003b). Thus individuals with high levels of self-kindness who
experience project failure are less likely to harshly criticize themselves for failing to meet
ideal standards for the project.
Self-kindness does not diminish the emotional importance of the project that failed but
dissuades individuals from judging themselves as ‘bad’ based on its failure. With selfkindness, individuals are less likely to harshly criticize the self for failing to meet ideal
standards (Neff, 2003a) which creates a buffer against anxiety when considering one’s
weaknesses (Neff et al., 2007). Along with less anxiety, self-kindness helps prevent individuals from ruminating, which leads to an escalation of negative emotions (NolenHoeksema, 1991). Therefore by being able to divorce project failure as an event from
evaluations of the self, a self-kind organizational member can reduce the level of negative
emotional reaction to project failure. Thus:
Proposition 2a: The more self-kind an organizational member, the weaker the negative
emotional reaction to a project’s failure.
Self-kindness relies on discriminating wisdom, which ‘clearly evaluates the positive
or negative quality of actions but does so with a compassionate understanding of the
complex, dynamic situational factors that impact these actions, so that particular performances are not taken as indicators of self-worth’ (Neff et al., 2005, p. 264). This
does not mean that such failings go unnoticed or are passively accepted. On the contrary, self-kindness helps remove barriers to learning from failure. It is when one
harshly judges oneself that the protective mechanisms of the ego are activated. These
mechanisms screen inadequacies from self-awareness so that self-esteem is maintained
(Horney, 1950; Neff, 2003a; Reich, 1949) but obstruct learning. Self-kindness provides
the emotional safety net to allow greater self-awareness through a more objective perspective of the failure event. That is, it prevents individuals from being carried away
by their subjective reactions (Neff, 2003a), perhaps leading to ruminations (NolenHoeksema, 1991), and exacerbating negative emotions further (Nolen-Hoeksema,
1991). These exacerbated negative emotions typically interfere with the learning
process (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Shepherd, 2003), because when negative emotions

are the focus, individuals have less attention and information processing available for
learning from the failure event. In addition, awareness of one’s mistakes and weaknesses is an important input into the learning process, and self-kindness can enhance
this awareness. By being able to assess project failure divorced from overall evaluations
of self-worth, a self-compassionate individual has fewer obstacles to interfere in the
learning process. Thus:
Proposition 2b: Greater self-kindness will reduce the negative impact a negative emotional reaction from project failure has on learning from the experience.
Common humanity and learning from project failure. Common humanity ‘refers to perceiving
one’s experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as
separating and isolating’ (Neff, 2003a, p. 85). That is, an organizational member perceives his or her own failure experience in light of the common human experience in an
organization, acknowledging that failures are part of the innovative process and that all
people – oneself included – are worthy of compassion. This allows the individual to
remain interconnected and equal with others (Brown, 1999) and thus more likely to
extend oneself forgiveness for mistakes that lead to project failure.
These mechanisms emphasizing commonality are unlikely to diminish the importance
of any one organizational project to the employee, but rather when the project fails the
subsequent feelings are put in a context. That is, by recognizing that the feelings of
suffering from project failure are shared with other employees, individuals are less critical
of themselves (Rubin, 1975) and more likely to forgive themselves for their mistakes (Neff,
2003a). Project failure is therefore seen less as a challenge to one’s self-esteem. However,
for those with less common humanity, project failure is likely to be seen as more
threatening because the individual feels isolated and therefore experiences lower relatedness, and the associated diminished PWB. Threatening situations are perceived negatively, causing stress and anxiety (e.g. Leary et al., 2001). Thus:
Proposition 3a: The greater the common humanity of an organizational member, the
weaker the negative emotional reaction to a project’s failure.
Greater common humanity is also likely to impact one’s learning from failure, because
the recognition that everyone experienced the loss generated by the failure may allow the
organizational member to also share in the necessary unbiased diagnosis of the cause and
potential solutions for the project failure. By lessening the degree of blame on oneself,
individuals are less likely to engage ego defensive mechanisms such as arbitrary externalized attributions of blame. Externalizing causes of blame are often effective in protecting self-esteem (e.g. Brockner and Guare, 1983) but provide little scope for learning
since there is little to learn when one believes a failure is caused by factors entirely beyond
the individual’s control (e.g. Diener and Dweck, 1980). Instead, the experience of
common humanity may lead to a shared desire to determine the appropriate attributions
for the failure. Certainly an organizational member could attribute project failures to a
variety of causes (e.g. oneself, management, the economy). However, true learning from
the failure event, in terms of trying to understand what actually went wrong and how to

<-----Page 13----->936

prevent similar problems from occurring in the next project, requires a fair and honest
assessment of the failure’s root causes. Leary et al. (2007) refer to this as impartial
attributions rather than self-attributions. Neff (2003a) argued that self-compassion should
be just as effective in protecting organizational members’ PWB from negative events
regardless of whether the event was their fault. Leary et al. (2007) empirically found that
self-compassion led to greater effort to be kind to oneself when negative events were
attributed to oneself, but that in general self-compassion provides benefits regardless of
the attribution for blame.
Common humanity is partly demonstrated by an organizational member when he or
she tries to remind themselves that feelings of inadequacy are shared by most people after
project failure, tries to see one’s failings as part of the human condition in an organizational context, reminds oneself that there are lots of people in this organization and other
organizations that feel down and out when a project fails, and that these are difficulties
that everyone goes through (adapted from Neff, 2003b). Without this connection to
others, individuals can become isolated, reducing their informal learning of skills and
access to important information, as well as make them less able to exercise initiative
(Martinko and Gardner, 1982). An organizational member with greater common
humanity no longer remains connected with the failure because he or she has forgiven
oneself for making the mistakes that lead to the failure (and has also forgiven others that
may be blamed for the failure), and such forgiveness ameliorates the defensive mechanisms that interfere with the learning process. Thus:
Proposition 3b: Greater common humanity will reduce the negative impact a negative
emotional reaction from project failure has on learning from the experience.

Mindfulness and learning from project failure. Mindfulness refers to ‘holding painful
thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them’
(Neff, 2003a, p. 85).[5] It is demonstrated, in part, through an emphasis on balance and
avoidance of over-identification. For example, a mindful organizational member keeps
emotions from project failure in balance, approaches feelings about project failure with
curiosity and openness and takes a balanced view of the failure event by keeping things
in perspective (adapted from Neff, 2003b). Organizational members low in mindfulness
likely become heavily influenced by their own feelings (Neff, 2003a, p. 88). For example,
when focusing on a project failure, attention can shift from the event to the negative
emotions surrounding the event, escalating the negative emotional reaction (NolenHoeksema, 1991) to the project’s failure.
This is not to suggest that a mindful organizational member does not feel emotions
from project failure, rather these emotions are put in a larger context so that their
significance is seen with greater perspective (Neff, 2003a, p. 89; Teasdale et al., 2000).
This larger context does not threaten self-esteem and therefore does not trigger the
erection of ego-protective barriers to learning. Mindfulness helps break the cycle of
self-absorption and avoid ruminations and over-identification. For example, Shapiro
et al. (2005) found that an eight week mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention
was effective in increasing self-compassion and lowering stress in healthcare profession© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009

<-----Page 14----->Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure

937

als. Mindfulness makes the negative outcomes of project failure less salient and therefore
minimizes the negative emotional reaction to it. Thus:
Proposition 4a: The more mindful an organizational member, the weaker the negative
emotional reaction to a project’s failure.
Rather than focusing on the painful thoughts and feelings surrounding project failure,
a mindful organizational member does not link the project failure to his or her self-worth
and therefore is able to avoid severe judgments and criticisms of the self to accept the
experience for what it is (a learning opportunity) and to bring it into conscious awareness
(Hayes et al., 1996). Mindfulness allows the use of emotions to signal the importance of
the event as a learning opportunity (Lazarus, 1993; Weick, 1979) but not let the generation of negative emotions consume information processing capacity (Matthews et al.,
1990; Wells and Matthews, 1994), limiting the individual’s ability to learn from the
experience. Balancing emotions in such a way is an important aspect of self-regulation
and the central characteristic for mindfulness. For example, managing negative emotions
from an event can be achieved by oscillation between a loss orientation – a focus on
working through and processing some aspect of the failure event – and a restoration
orientation – distracting oneself from thinking about the loss and attending to secondary
stressor caused by the failure (Shepherd, 2003; Stroebe and Schut, 1999). Oscillation is
a mechanism by which organizational members can keep their negative emotions from
project failure in balance to enhance the learning process. Individuals vary in their ability
to regulate emotion (Tugade and Fredrickson, 2004), and some are better at using
emotion knowledge (mindfulness) to cope in times of stress (Barrett and Gross,
2001).
Mindfulness keeps ruminations and over identifications in check to allow for greater
discernment in detecting valuable information about the failure event, and then interpreting and learning from that information. Mindfulness can be considered at one level
a form of detachment similar to the open, non-judgmental stance taken in therapist–
client interactions (Bohart, 1993; Neff, 2003a). But it is not detached from the process;
rather mindfulness involves detaching the evaluation of the event from the evaluation of
the self. By detaching the event from oneself, fewer barriers to learning are erected. Thus:
Proposition 4b: Greater mindfulness will reduce the negative impact a negative emotional reaction from project failure has on learning from the experience.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of our model was to offer an explanation for the intensity of the negative
emotional reaction to project failure and the ability to learn from the failure experience.
The intensity of the negative emotional reaction to project failure depends on the extent
that the satisfaction of the psychological needs of competence, autonomy and relatedness
are thwarted by the loss of project involvement. Further, we suggested that more intense
negative emotional reactions are likely to have a detrimental effect on learning from
failure unless individuals are competent self-regulators, in particular having high levels

of self-compassion, including self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. We
believe that this model has a number of important implications.
First, we believe that project failure is a form of change not sufficiently represented by
the current emotion-focused change models. This literature has focused on organizational members’ resistance to, or behaviours as a result of, organizational change. For
example, Kiefer (2005) studied the negative emotions generated by perceptions of an
ongoing organizational change – perceptions of an insecure future, of inadequate
working conditions, and of treatment by the organization. The outcome variables were
trust in the organization and withdrawal from the organization. Similarly, Shapiro and
Kirkman (1999) investigated the emotional response to the implementation of selfmanaging work teams (organizational change) on resistance to change and turnover
intentions. Our study is consistent with the above in that we also investigate psychological consequences of a change event. However, our focus on project failure represents a
unique form of organizational change experienced by a member. It is unique in that the
change was introduced by the organizational member’s (and/or his or her team’s) poor
performance at the project task. The change was not top-down induced such as with the
introduction of self-managing work teams (Shapiro and Kirkman, 1999), merger (Cartwright and Cooper, 1993), and downsizing (Conlon and Shapiro, 2002). Emphasis is on
managing the process of change to remove resistance and ensure commitment to (and
success of) the change effort. In this paper we focused on project failure where the
organizational member was the ‘cause’ of the change, and thus a highly relevant
outcome is individual learning from the experience. That is, the response to one project
failure (a change) impacts the likelihood of subsequent project failure (additional
changes). Further, because we are looking at project failures that have personal significance, or where psychological ownership exists (Pierce et al., 2001), such events are more
likely to elicit emotional reactions, based on cognitive appraisal theories of emotion (e.g.
Lazarus, 1991). We hope that future research further explores the role of emotion and
emotion regulation from member-induced change on non-motivational outcomes.
Second, our model incorporates both hedonic and eudiamonic perspectives on wellbeing, both of which are essential for individuals to thrive at work (Spreitzer et al., 2005).
Hedonically, ‘people seek out pleasurable experiences’, and eudaimonically, ‘individuals seek to realize their full potential as human beings’ (Spreitzer et al., 2005). When
psychological well-being is decreased, such as from the failure of a project from which
organizational members previously received eudemonic pleasure (such as from a feeling
of fulfilment at exercising one’s competence, autonomy, and relatedness), their hedonic
well-being or simple pleasure is also likely to suffer resulting in negative emotions. The
combined effect is that individuals are no longer capable of thriving at work since they
are likely less cognitively and affectively engaged in their work (Spreitzer et al., 2005).
Although the negative implications of organizational members not thriving at work are
already well understood (e.g. Danna and Griffin, 1999; Spreitzer et al., 2005; Wright and
Cropanzano, 1998), our model offers an explanation for variability in organizational
members’ thriving at work after a project failure. Of particular interest to future research
is that it is perhaps the very relationship that organizational members have with their
projects that promotes their thriving at work that also means that they will experience
more intense negative emotional reaction when that project fails. Indeed, the notion of

<-----Page 16----->Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure

939

antecedent-focused emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) suggests that emotional reactions
will be lessened when individuals deliberately distance themselves from things, such as
work projects, that otherwise may evoke potentially negative emotions.
Third, and related to the previous point, our model of the intensity of the negative
emotional reaction to project failure provides a way to further examine the concept of
disengagement at work (Kahn, 1990), or how people uncouple themselves from work
roles which they may have previously internalized. During the process of personal
disengagement, organizational members physically, cognitively, and/or emotionally
withdraw themselves from a work role (Kahn, 1990), which can have major implications
for attitudes and behaviours within the workplace. For example, disengaged workers
may be apathetic or detached from their work (Goffman, 1961), performing only the
minimum requirements of their jobs, or they may be impersonal or emotionally unexpressive with co-workers and customers (e.g. Rafaeli and Sutton, 1990). Individuals who
experience strong negative emotional reactions to project failure may purposefully disengage in their work roles in order to protect themselves from potential future experiences of project failure (or perhaps only while recovering from negative emotional
reactions). Future research that explicitly examines how people are enlivened or deadened during role performances at work (Kahn, 1990) following project failures may yield
important insights into this process. Moreover, examination of how self-compassion can
thwart dis-engagement and foster re-engagement in work roles seems promising, particularly in terms of how organizations can facilitate member’s re-engagement.
Fourth, we examine the relationship between self-compassion and learning from
project failure as a complement to existing work on psychological well-being and positive
organizational psychology. The positive relationship between self-esteem and psychological well-being is important because diminished psychological well-being has been associated with elevated health problems (Buttner, 1992; Ufuk and Özgen, 2001), psychological
problems ( Jamal, 1997; Jamal and Badawi, 1995) and work dissatisfaction (Buttner, 1992;
Jamal, 1997). However, self-regulation mechanisms for building and maintaining a high
self-esteem may not be an unambiguous blessing and have been associated with narcissism, self-absorption and self-centredness (Damon, 1995; Ryan and Deci, 2001; Seligman,
1995). We complement self-esteem explanations with the notion of self-compassion
as a self-regulation mechanism well suited for dealing with failure experiences. Selfcompassion reduces the need for individuals to engage ego-defensive mechanisms that on
the one hand protect self-esteem but on the other hand obstruct learning.
Our focus on more positive constructs such as compassion, forgiveness, and psychological well-being are consistent with the effort of the positive organizational psychology
movement to focus on positive rather than negative aspects of organizational life. In
particular, we contribute to the stream of research called positive organizational behaviours (POB), which looks at positive strengths and psychological capacities of individuals
that can be measured, developed, and managed in the workplace (Luthans and Youssef,
2004). Both POS and POB look at positive states of individuals at work, in contrast to
personality type variables more typically investigated in positive organizational psychology (Luthans and Youssef, 2004). While POS often uses an individual, group, or organizational level of analysis, to our knowledge this research has not yet explored an
intra-individual level of analysis. Our contribution is thus to look at such intra-individual

variation of both how strong the negative emotional reaction to project failure is for
individuals, as well as how well they are able to learn from such failure, as it varies based
upon the particular project that has failed and the extent to which it is experienced as a
personally meaningful loss.
Finally, the model of negative emotional reactions from work-related failure has
implications for research on individuals’ roles within entrepreneurial and innovative
organizations. Entrepreneurial and innovative organizations pursue high-variance
opportunities, and while this helps improve mean performance it also means that they
are likely to experience many project failures (McGrath, 1999). While real options
reasoning provides a mechanism for managing the uncertainty of projects, our model
suggests that project failure will generate a negative emotional reaction for those involved
in the project (although a more intense reaction for some than others and more intense
for some projects that other projects). Understanding the role of project failure on the
psychological and emotional well-being of organizational members is an important
complement to research on the management of entrepreneurial and innovative organizations. In addition, further investigations of the role that self-compassion plays in
learning from project failure will likely have important implications for the effectiveness
of real options reasoning as an organizational strategy.
Future Research
To empirically test the proposed model, future researchers could rely on well established
measures for the satisfaction of needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness (for a
review, see Deci et al., 1999). For example, an adaptation of Vlachopoulos and Michailidou (2006) could include questions on the extent to which the failed project had satisfied
the need for: (1) competence like ‘I felt that I make a substantial contribution towards
progressing the project’ and ‘I felt that I executed very effectively the project’s tasks’; (2)
autonomy like ‘I feel that the way that I work on the project is definitely an expression
of myself’ and ‘I felt very strongly that I had the opportunity to make choices with respect
to how the project was undertaken’; and (3) relatedness like ‘I felt extremely comfortable
with the other members of the project team’ and ‘I felt that there were open channels of
communication with the other team members’. There are also established measures for
negative emotions (Barclay et al., 2005; Chen and Spector, 1991). Using a longitudinal
design, researchers could capture the intrinsic motivation of work (satisfaction of the
needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness) pre- and post-project emotions. This
gap could be used to explain variance in the intensity of the negative emotional reaction
to project failure. Empirically explaining variance in the intensity of the negative emotional reaction to project failure will represent an important step towards a deeper
understanding of individual differences in learning from failure.
In addition, existing scales for self-compassion can be used to measure self kindness,
common humanity, and mindfulness (SCS) (Neff, 2003b). Leary et al. (2007) have
suggested a number of other important considerations in empirically examining selfcompassion, including how it differs from self-esteem, its relationship to attributions for
negative events, and how it impacts self-evaluation versus other evaluations of performance. Longitudinal research could explore the dynamic process of how organizational

<-----Page 18----->Negative Emotional Reactions to Project Failure

941

members cope with the negative emotions generated by project failure over time, varying
not only in whether or not they recover but to what extent and how long the process takes
them, and how these are influenced by the three aspects of self-compassion. Measures of
learning from project failure also need to be developed. For example, learning could be
measured by the accuracy of attributions organizational members make for the failure
(self-attributions versus impartial attributions; Leary et al., 2007). Of note is that learning
is not always immediate, so longitudinal research should take into account varying time
lags in collecting such data.
Third, future research could explore how other contextual variables, such as the
level of perceived organizational support (e.g. Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002), supervisory or unit-level support and control (e.g. Bacharach and Bamberger, 2007), procedural fairness (Thibaut and Walker, 1975), or even compassion organizing (Dutton
et al., 2006) at an organizational or unit level might influence individual selfcompassion and reaction and recovery following project failure. We suspect that there
will likely be dynamic joint influences of both sets of variables on individual learning
following project failure.
Fourth, we have assumed that higher levels of self-compassion are always better than
lower levels of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. However, excessive
levels of any of these may prove detrimental rather than beneficial to one’s ability to
regulate negative emotional reactions and learn following project failures. For example,
too much self-kindness may lead to complacency or laziness, where organizational
members do not take action to prevent future mistakes because they more easily forgive
themselves for things they do wrong (Leary et al., 2007). Excessive common humanity
may lead to an inability to form an identity distinct from one’s work group, since
common humanity involves seeing oneself as part of a broader group that shares similar
experiences. A lack of a feeling of distinctiveness can diminish psychological well-being
– distinctiveness and belonging need to be balanced (Brewer, 1991). Extreme mindfulness may lead to a diminished emotional reaction to events that are indeed worthy of an
extreme reaction (or total focus and immersion in a particular emotional experience),
such as the demise of an entire organization (Shepherd, 2003). Prior research has
suggested that these are not likely problems from self-compassion, since it is associated
with proactive acceptance, growth, and confronting (rather than avoiding) current
negative outcomes (Leary et al., 2007). However, further research should consider the
potential for curvilinear rather than linear relationships between these aspects of selfcompassion and the experience of negative emotional reactions to failure, as well as the
potential learning following failure.
Finally, in this paper we categorized negative emotions together (consistent with a
number of studies on emotions at work (Cox, 1997; Fisher, 2000; Huy, 2002). However,
discrete emotion theory (Scherer et al., 2001) proposes that when we combine a number
of different emotions we lose information about the distinctive role of each emotion
(Lazarus, 2003). Future research can investigate which negative emotions are generated
from different project failures. Perhaps those project failures that thwart the need for
competence generate different negative emotions than those project failures that thwart
the need for autonomy. Future research, from a discrete emotion theory perspective, can
investigate the different impact that different negative emotions have on learning from

failure. Perhaps self-compassion is more effective at diminishing the negative impact of
anger on learning from failure but not on the relationship between anxiety and learning.
CONCLUSION
Organizations want employees who can learn and adapt to change. A key learning
opportunity arises when projects fail (McGrath, 1999; Shepherd, 2003) due to underperformance of individuals or teams. We suggest that individuals are better equipped to
learn following negative emotional reactions to project failure when they are able to
demonstrate self-compassion in the form of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Thus organizations should seek to encourage such behaviour and even provide
developmental opportunities where employees can learn such skills. Luthans and Youssef
(2004) suggest many ways in which individuals can develop their positive psychological
capital, including their resiliency subsequent to failure experiences. More broadly, organizations can work to develop self-regulation and emotional coping skills in their employees (e.g. Gross, 1998; Kerr et al., 2006), so that the potentially productive benefits of
negative events, such as learning from project failures, can be realized. We encourage
additional work on the practical and scholarly issues related to failure, negative emotional reactions, and self-compassion.
NOTES
[1] Projects can also be terminated for other reasons, such as having achieved their strategic objective.
Whether the project is terminated because of poor performance (failure) or for other strategic reasons,
both may generate a negative emotional reaction.
[2] Negative emotional reaction refers to the experience of an emotion that is negatively valent such as loss,
frustration, stress, sadness, emptiness, dejection, or fear (Bartunek, 1993; Scherer et al., 2001) following
a specific event, in this case the failure of a work project. We follow the assumptions of appraisal theory
(Scherer et al., 2001) that emotions are triggered by evaluations of events that cause specific reactions in
different people.
[3] Others have suggested, however, that suppression of emotions such as through regulation may instead
increase physical health risks (e.g. Gross and Levenson, 2007).
[4] Huy’s (1999, p. 325) notion of emotional capability refers ‘to an organization’s ability to acknowledge,
recognize, monitor, discriminate, and attend to its members’ emotions, and it is manifested in the
organization’s norms and routines related to feeling (Schein, 1992)’. These feelings include empathy and
sympathy. While emotional capability is an organizational level construct and empathy and sympathy
are meso-level constructs, our focus is at the individual level and we are not focused on understanding
the emotions of others that are suffering (empathy) or the emotions one feels in response to others’
