EXPLORING INTERNAL STICKINESS: IMPEDIMENTS
TO THE TRANSFER OF BEST PRACTICE WITHIN
THE FIRM

c

GABRIEL SZULANSKI
The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

The ability to transfer best practices internally is critical to a firtn's ability to build competitive
advantage through the appropriation of rents from scarce internal knowledge. Just as a firm's
distinctive competencies tnight be dificult for other firms to imitate, its best prczctices could be
dfficult to imitate internnlly. Yet, little systematic attention has been pcrid to such internal
stickiness. The author analyzes itlterrzal stickiness of knowledge transfer crnd tests the resulting
model using canonical correlation analysis of a data set consisting of 271 observations of 122
best-practice transfers in eight companies. Contrary to corzverztiorzrzl wisdom that blames
primarily motivational factors, the study findings show the major barriers to internal knowledge
transfer to be knowledge-related factors such as the recipient's lack oj absorptive capacity,
causal anzbiguity, and an arciuous relationship between the source and the recipient.

The identification and transfer of best practices
is emerging as one of the most important and
widespread practical management issues of the
latter half of the 1990s. Armed with meaningful,
detailed performance data, firms that use factbased management methods such as TQM, benchmarking, and process reengineering can regularly
compare the performance of their units along
operational dimensions. Sparse but unequivocal
evidence suggests that such comparisons often
reveal surprising performance differences between
units, indicating a need to improve knowledge
utilization within the firm (e.g., Chew, Bresnahan,
and Clark, 1990).' Because internal transfers typi-

gaps in performance in otherwise comparable units, and gaps

Camp, a widely known benchmarking specialist at Xerox,
confirmed that gaps of 200-300 percent are a typical finding
in internal benchmarking efforts.

cally are hindered less by confidentiality and legal
obstacles than external transfers, they could be
faster and initially less complicated, all other
things being equal. For those reasons, in an era
when continuous organizational learning and
relentless performance improvement are needed to
remain competitive, companies must increasingly
resort to the internal transfer of capabilitie~.~
Yet, experience shows that transferring capabilities within a firm is far from easy. General
Motors had great difficulty in transferring manufacturing practices between divisions (Kerwin and
Woodruff, 1992: 74) and IBM had limited success in transferring reengineered logistics and
hardware design processes between business units
(The Economist, 1993). Although strategic management research has examined impediments to
the transfer of best practices (i.e., organizational

'Such concern is typically expressed as the need to avoid
the duplication of effort or to capture the benefits of the
internal 'pockets of excellence' and the 'great ideas' that

capabilities) between firms because such practices
are seen as important drivers of firm performance
(e.g., Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Grant, 1991),
impediments to transfer capabilities within firms
have received little attention.
This article reports the findings of a systematic
empirical investigation of internal stickiness. The
study analyzed internal stickiness of knowledge
transfer and tested the resulting model by canonical correlation analysis of a data set consisting
of 27 1 observations of 122 best-practice transfers
in eight companies. Contrary to conventional wisdom that places primary blame on motivational
factors, the major barriers to internal knowledge
transfer are shown to be knowledge-related factors such as the recipient's lack of absorptive
capacity, causal ambiguity, and an arduous
relationship between the source and the recipient.

ANALYZING INTERNAL STICKINESS
Definitions
The transfer of best practice inside the firm has
a concrete and fairly unambiguous meaning to
practitioners. It connotes the firm's replication of
an internal practice that is performed in a superior
way in some part of the organization and is
deemed superior to internal alternate practices and
known alternatives outside the company. Practice
refers to the organization's routine use of knowledge and often has a tacit component, embedded
partly in individual skills and partly in collaborative social arrangements (Nelson and Winter,
1982; Kogut and Zander, 1992).
The word 'transfer' is used rather than 'diffusion' to emphasize that the movement of
knowledge within the organization is a distinct
experience, not a gradual process of dissemination, and depends on the characteristics of
everyone involved. Transfers of best practice are
thus seen as dyadic exchanges of organizational
knowledge between a source and a recipient unit
in which the identity of the recipient matters. The
exchange of organizational knowledge consists of
an exact or partial replication of a web of coordinating relationships connecting specific resources
so that a different but similar set of resources is
coordinated by a very similar web of relationships. In this sense, transfers of best practice
could be conceived as replications of organizational routines (Winter, 1995).

Stages in the transfer process
Intrafirm transfer of best practice is seen as an
unfolding process consisting of stages in which
characteristic factors not only appear in greater
or lesser degree but also in a certain order of
occurrence. Four stages are identified: initiation,
implementation, ramp-up, and integrati~n.~

Initiation

This stage comprises all events that lead to the
decision to transfer. A transfer begins when both
a need and the knowledge to meet that need
coexist within the organization, possibly undiscovered. The discovery of the need may trigger
a search for potential solutions, a search that
leads to the discovery of superior knowledge.
Alternatively, the discovery of superior knowledge may reframe as unsatisfactory a hitherto
satisfactory situation (cf. Rogers, 1983; Zaltman,
Duncan, and Holbek, 1973; Glaser, Abelson, and
Garrison, 1983). In the language of benchmarking, the discovery of superior results will
reveal how good is 'best' and who is currently
best (Balm, 1992). That discovery may be followed by a more focused inquiry into how those
results are obtained. Once the need and a potential
solution to that need are identified, their fit-that
is, the feasibility of the transfer-is explored. As
Teece (1976) found, that process often requires
months of information collection and evaluation.
The events that lead to the decision to transfer
may follow an orderly sequence or one that
resembles the working of an organized anarchy
(Cohen, March, and Olsen, 1972).

Implementation

The implementation stage begins with the
decision to proceed. During this stage, resources
flow between the recipient and the source (and
maybe a third party). Transfer-specific social ties
between the source and the recipient are estab3The stages model presented in this section builds on the
insights of the rich empirical traditions of research on innovation diffusion (Rogers, 1983), social change (see Glaser et
al., 1983, for a review), technology transfer (e.g., Teece,
1976; Galbraith, 1990), and implementation (e.g., Tyre, 1991 ;
Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994).

<-----Page 3----->Exploring Internal Stickiness
lished and the transferred practice is often adapted
to suit the anticipated needs of the recipient, to
preempt problems experienced in a previous
transfer of the same practice, or to help make the
introduction of new knowledge less threatening to
the recipient (cf. Rice and Rogers, 1980: 508509; Buttolph, 1992: 464). Implementationrelated activities cease or at least diminish after
the recipient begins using the transferred knowledge.

The ramp-up stage begins when the recipient
starts using the transferred knowledge, that is,
after the first day of use. During this stage, the
recipient will be predominantly concerned with
identifying and resolving unexpected problems
that hamper its ability to match or exceed posttransfer performance expectations. The recipient
is likely to use the new knowledge ineffectively
at first (cf. Baloff, 1970; Adler, 1990; Galbraith,
1990; Chew, 1991; Chew. Leonard-Barton, and
Bohn, 1991), but gradually improves performance, ramping up toward a satisfactory level. The
ramp-up stage provides a relatively brief window
of opportunity to rectify unexpected problems
(Tyre and Orlikowski, 1994).

29

Analyzing the difficulty of transferring
practices within the firm
The notion of internal stickiness connotes the
difficulty of transferring knowledge within the
~rganization.~The point of departure for the
analysis of internal stickiness is Arrow's (1969)
classificatory notes on the transmission of technical knowledge. Arrow observed that the capacity
of a social conduit of knowledge is inherently
constrained and hence social conduits are costly
to use. Referring to Arrow, Teece (1977: 242)
argued that the ease or difficulty of transferring
technical knowledge is reflected in the cost of
a transfer. More recently, von Hippel (1994)
introduced the notion of 'sticky information' to
describe information that is difficult to transfer,
stickiness being reflected in the incremental cost
of transferring the information.

Cost, eventfulness and internal stickiness

Cost could be a poor descriptor of difficulty,
however. First, deciding exactly which portion of
the cost of a transfer actually reflects difficultythe increment-is a matter of conjecture without
a base case-the cost of the same transfer without
such difficulty. Systematically constructed base
cases are rare, and past experience in transferring
knowledge might be inadequate as a base case if

stable (Berger and Luckman, 1966). In this way,
new practices become institutionalized. They progressively lose their novelty and become part "n the strategy literature, the adjective 'sticky' has been

likely to engage, and thus be noticed by, a
broader range of participants. This second type
of problem is also likely to be remembered as
being relatively more difficult to resolve, at least
by those who could not cope with them without
assistance.
Hence, problems that participants cannot handle
on a routine basis are likely to evoke the greatest
overall perception of difficulty. Whether or not
problems are objectively difficult to resolve matters little because perceptual processes, not objective properties, affect organizational behavior (cf.
Hellriegel and Slocum, 1974). The perceived difficulty of a problem for the individual is what
determines his or her reaction to it. Therefore,
transfers that involve the most nonroutine problems will be perceived as the most difficult, other
things being equal. This suggests that the notion
of eventfulness, the extent to which problematic
situations experienced during a transfer are worthy of remark, is conceptually related to the
notion of difficulty. Eventfulness has a universal
base case: a transfer that is not at all difficult is
unremarkable, is uneventful. The implication is
that an organization equipped with effective routines to handle all aspects of a transfer is unlikely
to consider that transfer sticky.
Eventfulness could be translated into an outcome-based descriptor of stickiness. If an organization has effective routines to handle all aspects
of a knowledge transfer, it should be able to
specify milestones, budgets, and expectations for
the transfer process rather accurately. To the
extent that the transfer turns out to be sticky,
requiring ad hoc solutions, some of those milestones are likely to be missed, budgeted cost
will be exceeded. and some of the participants'
expectations about the transfer will not be fully
met. As in the case of cost, the outcome-based
descriptor requires the specification of a transferspecific base case in the form of ex ante expectations.
A transfer-specific base case is not necessary,
however, if the descriptor of stickiness is based
on the process rather than the outcome of the
process. Combining the notion of eventfulness
with the stages model presented in the preceding
section provides four different descriptors of
stickiness, one for each stage of the transfer.
The process model suggests that the problems
encountered as the transfer unfolds will vary
according to the stage of the transfer. During

the initiation stage, problems will stem from
efforts to identify needs, identify knowledge
that meets those needs, and assess the feasibility
of the transfer. During the implementation
stage, problems will reflect efforts to bridge the
communication gap between the source and the
recipient or to adapt the practice to the recipient's needs. During the ramp-up stage, problems
will reflect the struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance. Finally, during the integration
stage, problems will reflect efforts to achieve
and preserve routine use of the new knowledge
in the recipient. The more these problems
require participants to develop ad hoe
solutions-that
is, the more remarkable the
problems are-the higher will be the perceived
eventfulness of the transfer.

ORIGINS OF INTERNAL STICKINESS
Prior research suggests that four sets of factors
are likely to influence the difficulty of knowledge
transfer: characteristics of the knowledge transferred, of the source, of the recipient, and of the
context in which the transfer takes place (e.g.,
Leonard-Barton, 1990: Teece, 1977; Rogers,
1983). Some researchers place an almost exclusive emphasis on the attributes of the knowledge
transferred (e.g., Zander and Kogut. 1995; Winter,
1987). Others stress the characteristics of the
situation in which the transfer occurs (e.g.,
Arrow, 1969). However, all four sets of factors
can be used together in an eclectic model that
allows their relative influence to be measured.
Descriptions of the primary variables within each
set of factors follow.

Characteristics of the knowledge transferred
Cu~tsalambiguity
Modeling a capability as a production function,
Lippman and Rumelt (1982) argued that difficulty
in the replication of a capability is most likely
to emanate from ambiguity about what the factors
of production are and how they interact during
production. When the precise reasons for success
or failure in replicating a capability in a new
setting cannot be determined even ex post, causal
ambiguity is present and it is impossible to pro-

<-----Page 5----->Exploring Internal Stickiness

duce an unambiguous list of the factors of production, much less measure their marginal contribution (Rumelt, 1984; 562).
Key to their argument is the notion of irreducible uncertainty. Polanyi (1962: 49) suggested
that the undefinable portion of knowledge is
embodied in highly tacit human skills. Tacitness
could also be a property of collectively held
knowledge (Winter, 1987; Kogut and Zander,
1992) and it is often singled out as a central
attribute of knowledge with respect to its transferability (Spender, 1993; Nonaka, 1994; Grant,
1996). Causal ambiguity could also result from
imperfectly understood idiosyncratic features of
the new context in which knowledge is put to
use (Tyre and von Hippel, forthcoming; Winter,
1995).
Unprovenness

Knowledge with a proven record of past usefulness is less difficult to transfer. Such a record
hints of robustness and helps in the process of
selecting knowledge for transfer. Without such a
record, it is more difficult to induce potential
recipients to engage in the transfer (Rogers, 1983)
and to legitimize controversial integration efforts
(Goodman, Bazerman, and Conlon, 1980; Nelson
and Winter, 1982).

Characteristics of the source of knowledge
Lack of motivation

A knowledge source may be reluctant to share
crucial knowledge for fear of losing ownership,
a position of privilege, superiority; it may resent
not being adequately rewarded for sharing hardwon success; or it may be unwilling to devote
time and resources to support the transfer.
Not perceived as reliable

An expert and trustworthy source is more likely
than others to influence the behavior of a recipient (e.g., see Perloff, 1993, ch. 6, for a review).
When the source unit is not perceived as
reliable, is not seen as trustworthy or knowledgeable, initiating a transfer from that source
will be more difficult and its advice and
example are likely to be challenged and resisted
(cf. Walton, 1975).

31

Characteristics of the recipient of knowledge
Lack of motivation

The reluctance of some recipients to accept
knowledge from the outside (the 'not invented
here' or NIH syndrome) is well documented (e.g.,
Hayes and Clark, 1985; Katz and Allen, 1982).
Lack of motivation may result in foot dragging,
passivity, feigned acceptance, hidden sabotage, or
outright rejection in the implementation and use
of new knowledge (cf. Zaltman, Duncan, and
Holbek, 1973).
Lack of absorptive capacity

Recipients might be unable to exploit outside
sources of knowledge; that is, they may lack
absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990:
128). Such capacity is largely a function of their
preexisting stock of knowledge (Dierickx and
Cool, 1989) and it becomes manifest in their
ability to value, assimilate and apply new knowledge successfully to commercial ends.
Lack of retentive capacity

A transfer of knowledge is effective only when
the knowledge transferred is retained (Glaser et
al., 1983; Druckman and Bjork, 1991). Evidence
from studies of innovation (e.g., Rogers, 1983:
365; Nord and Tucker, 1987: 9 ) and planned
organizational change (Goodman and Dean, 1982:
228; Yin, 1979; see Glaser et al., 1983: 221-25 1
for a review) suggests that persistence cannot be
taken for granted. The ability of a recipient to
institutionalize the utilization of new knowledge
reflects its 'retentive' capacity. In the absence of
such ability, initial difficulties during the integration of received knowledge may become an
excuse for discontinuing its use and, when feasible, reverting to the previous status quo (Zaltman
et al., 1973).

Characteristics of the context
Barren organizational context

Intrafirm exchanges of knowledge are embedded
in an organizational context, the characteristics of
which may affect their gestation and evolution.
Like a plant, a transfer that unfolds fully in one

<-----Page 6----->32

context may grow poorly in another or stagnate
in a third. An organizational context that facilitates the development of transfers is said to be
fertile. Conversely, a context that hinders the
gestation and evolution of transfers is said to be
barren. Prior research shows that formal structure
and systems, sources of coordination and expertise, and behavior-framing attributes of the organizational context affect the number of attempts to
transfer knowledge and the outcome of those
attempts (cf. Bower, 1970; Burgelman, 1983;
Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1994).
Arduous relationship
A transfer of knowledge, especially when the
knowledge transferred has tacit components, may
require numerous individual exchanges (Nonaka,
1994). The success of such exchanges depends
to some extent on the ease of communication
(Arrow, 1974) and on the 'intimacy' of the overall relationship between the source unit and the
recipient unit (cf. Marsden, 1990). An arduous
(i.e., laborious and distant) relationship might
create additional hardship in the transfer.

The second step of the survey was devised to
test the model. The final sample consisted of 271
returned questionnaires, spanning 122 transfers of
38 practice^,^ for a response rate of 61 percent.
To obtain a balanced perspective on each transfer
one questionnaire was sent to the source, one to
the recipient, and one to a third party to the
transfer. In terms of the type of respondent, 110
questionnaires were received from sources units,
101 from the recipient units and 60 from third
parties. Average item nonresponse was lower than
5 percent. On average 7.3 questionnaires were
received for each practice studied.
To provide practices for study, companies were
directed to search for transfers of important activities or processes between peer units, and to prefer
ones that showed evidence of difficulty during
the transfer and in the adaptation of the practice
by the recipient. They were also instructed to
rule out practices that could be performed by a
single individual and to choose only practices
that required the coordinated effort of many
people. Those practical guidelines were intended
to ensure selection of organizational activities that
correspond closely to the theoretical considerations involved in the replication of an organizational routine (Nelson and Winter, 1982).

METHOD
Sample and research process

The questionnaire

The data used to test the model were collected
through a two-step questionnaire survey. The first
step of the survey allowed self-selection of theoretically relevant companies and generated, for
companies that completed it successfully, a list
of transfers for study and a list of parties involved
in those transfers (i.e., of respondents). Firms
were considered theoretically relevant for the
study if they had strong incentives to transfer
best practices, were actively attempting to do so,
and saw the transfer of best practices as an
important corporate priority. The exchange of
information was regulated by the benchmarking
code of conduct devised by the American Productivity and Quality Center.
More than 60 companies expressed initial interest
and initiated the feasibilitv test. Of that ugrow. 12
the first phase
the survey and eight
were accepted for the second phase. The eight
were: AMP, AT&T haradyne, British
Castroll Chevron Co~oration,
EDS, Kaiser Permanente, and Rank Xerox.

In the design and administration of the questionnaire, several measures were taken to mitigate
measurement error (cf. Nunnally, 1978). The
questionnaire was formulated only after extensive
fieldwork. The pilot questionnaire was pretested
extensively by all the participating companies,
experienced academics, and respondents who volunteered to record in detail their reactions while
completing it. Finally, the cognitive load on the
respondents was reduced by customizing each
questionnaire with transfer- and company-specific
information collected during the first phase of
the survey.

The sample contained both technical and administrative practices. Examples of technical practices are software development procedures and drawing standards. Examples of administrative practices are upward appraisal and activity-based
costing (ABC). Full disclosure of the practices studied is
precluded by a guarantee of confidentiality.

<-----Page 7----->Exploring Internal Stickiness
Construction of measures
The items forming all constructs used in the study
are described in Appendix 1 (dependent variables)
and Appendix 2 (independent variables). Multi-item
scales were developed for all constructs to ensure
the reliability and validity of the measurement system. Little empirical precedent was available to
guide the development of the measures. A broad
and thorough literature review helped in the generation of the initial constructs and the a priori
assignment of items to measure those constructs.
In-depth clinical work helped refine the choice of
constructs and identify the most relevant items for
those constructs given the empirical context. Item
selection was based also on feedback obtained from
the pilot questionnaire and constructs were refined
further by using the full data set.
For simplicity in scoring, a single balanced 5point Likert-type scale that was relatively straightforward to master was used almost exclusively.
Unless otherwise indicated, the scale used was:
Y! = 'Yes!'; Y = 'yes, but'; o = 'no opinion';
N = 'no, not really'; N! = 'No!' The scale score
was computed by adding the standardized item
scores (cf. Nunnally, 1978). Dependent variables
were coded so that a larger numerical value
represents a higher level of stickiness. Independent variables were coded so that a larger
numerical value represents a higher barrier.
Table 1 summarizes the performance of the
measurement
model.
Convergent
validity
(reliability and unidimensionality) was evaluated
for each construct (cf. Gerbing and Anderson,
1988). Cronbach's alpha was used as a measure
of reliability because it provides a lower bound
for the reliability of a scale and is the most
widely used measure (cf. Nunnally, 1978). All
but two scales had a>0.7, thus providing an
adequate level of reliability for predictor tests
and hypothesized measures of a construct (see
Nunnally, 1978: 245-246). The two less reliable
scales scored marginally below that standard. The
performance of the binary scales of both motivation measures is particularly noteworthy in that
both scales qualify marginally for the Guttman
criterion for scalability (cf. McIver and Carmines,
198 1). Unidimensionality was assessed through
factor analysis and computation of the theta coefficient (Armor, 1974; Carmines and Zeller, 1979;
Zeller and Carmines, 1980). The unidimensionality of all 10 scales was adequate.

33

Discriminant validity was evaluated for all construct pairs by examining the observed correlation
matrix of the constructs. If the correlation
between constructs i and j is 1 (i.e., if constructs
i and j are perfectly correlated), the observed
correlation should be (ai.') x ( a j 5 ) , where a; and
ai are the reliability coefficients for the constructs.
In practical terms, testing for discriminant validity
entails computing the upper limit for the confidence interval of the observed correlations and
testing whether this limit is smaller than the
maximum possible correlation between the scales
as computed from their reliability coefficients (see
Howell, 1987: 121 for a critique of this approach
and ?ulorrison, 1976: 104- 105 for the underlying
mathematics). Table 2 reports on the correlations
for the independent variables. Table 3 reports the
correlations for the independent variables. All
construct pairs meet the discriminant validity test
at p<0.0012.

RESULTS
The explanatory power of the framework and the
relative importance of each barrier were assessed
by canonical correlation, which is unique in that
it can assess the relationship between two sets of
variables. It is appropriate when the phenomena
cannot be adequately expressed or measured by a
single variable, when any single criterion variable
taken in isolation is at best indicative of only a
part of the overall relationship (cf. Bolch and
Huang, 1974; Lambert and Durand, 1975;
Wherry, 1984). The results of the analysis are
summarized in Figure 1.

Explanatory power of the framework
Canonical analysis yields a score called canonical-R, which can be interpreted as the simple
correlation between the weighted sums of scores
from each set of variables, computed with the
weights pertaining to the first canonical root. The
canonical-R is fairly substantial (0.87) and highly
significant (p<0.001), suggesting that it is not
unlikely that the true correlation between the two
sets of constructs is very high. The canonical-R2
indicates that the stickiness canonical variate and
the origins-of-stickiness canonical variate share
about 75 percent of the variance.

0.72 for the source motivation scale and 0.63 for the recipient motivation scale. A scale with CR 2 0 . 9 and CS>0.6 can be
considered an adequate Guttman scale (see McIver and Carmines, 1981: 40-55).

Canonical correlation results

between the two sets of variables is obtained by
inspecting the redundancy scores, which measure
the redundancy of one set of variables given the
other set of variables. The redundancy scores are
obtained by multiplying the canonical R2 by the
proportion of variance extracted, which is computed by summing the squared canonical weights
in each canonical variate and dividing by the
number of variables in that variate. Hence, there
are two redundancy scores, one for the left-side
variables and the other for the right-side variables.
The redundancy scores computed with only the
first canonical root indicate that, given the stickiness variables, it is possible to account for 29
percent of the variance on the origins-of-stickiness variables. Conversely, given the origins-ofstickiness variables, it is possible to account for
roughly 45 percent of the variance of the stickiness variables.
Because the canonical roots are uncorrelated,
the redundancies can be summed across all roots

to arrive at a single index of redundancy (as
proposed by Stewart and Love, 1968). The total
redundancy values, based on all canonical roots,
indicate that on the average it is possible to
account for 39.1 percent of the variance in the
origins-of-stickiness variables given the stickiness
variables and 55.5 percent of the variance of the
stickiness variables given the origins-of-stickiness
variables. These results suggest a fairly strong
overall relationship between the variables of the
two sets.

Relative importance of each barrier
The canonical weights reflect the contribution of
each construct to its canonical variate-that is,
the linear combination of dependent or independent variables to which it belongs. The
weights pertain to the standardized ( z transformed) values and thus could be interpreted
in the same way as standardized beta coefficients

therefore can
be compared and the larger the absolute value of
a coefficient, the more important is the contribution of the corresponding variable. Figure 1
summarizes the findings.
The results suggest that the three most
important barriers are the lack of absorptive
capacity of the recipient (0.54), causal ambiguity
(0.34) and an arduous relationship between the
source and the recipient (0.33). Contrary to
expectation, the coefficient for the recipient's lack
of retentive capacity is negative (-0.25).

Robustness of the results
A key consideration in the objective interpretation
of canonical correlation analysis is weight instability (cf. Lambert and Durand, 1975). When
weights are unstable, a statistically significant
canonical correlation can occur even though the
criterion and predictor sets are not strongly
related. To rule out that possibility, each dependent variable was regressed separately on the
independent variables. All proved to be highly
significant, with R2,dj, ranging from 0.4 to 0.51.
Weight instability is partly a function of sample
size and intercorrelation between variables. The
canonical analysis used only 87 observations out
of the 271 sample points. Because the high number of missing observations was due primarily to
nonresponse to stickiness-outcome items, a
second canonical analysis was conducted in which
that variable was excluded from the left-side
canonical variate. The number of valid cases was
thus raised to 142. This second analysis confirmed
that the canonical-R is a robust finding (the
canonical-R decreases slightly to 0.84 and remains
highly significant). As expected, variations occur
both on the left- and right-side canonical weights,
yet the rank ordering of the weights does not
change on the left side. On the right side the
rank ordering does not change for the three most
important variables, which continue to account
for most of the variance on their canonical variate. The change in ranking and the fluctation of
the parameters suggest that the sample size may
be too small to ensure the stability of any but
the three largest canonical weights yet it does
not undermine the overall conclusion derived
'However, canonical analysis does not provide indications of
their statistical significance.

from the analysis, i.e., that knowledge-related
barriers dominate motivation related barriers.
The negative sign on the canonical weight of
the lack of recipient retentive capacity (-0.25) is
also a stable finding. In interpreting this finding,
it is important to note that all transfers in the
sample were reported between 4 and 8 months
after the first day recipients started using the
transferred knowledge. That is a relatively short
time in which to develop effective retentive
capacity for the use of new knowledge, let alone
to reveal the influence of that capacity on stickiness (cf. Lawless, 1987; Tyre and Orlikowski,
1994). A potential explanation for this finding is
that retentive capacity, when measured early in
the integration stage, represents to some extent
the formalized routine use of previous knowledge.
Hence, unlearning (Hedberg, 1981) will be
required to replace prior knowledge (cf. also
Hamel, 1991). Dismantling retentive capacity for
prior knowledge contributes to stickiness.
The plot of the canonical scores computed with
the first root solution did not reveal outliers,
a nonlinear (U- or S-shaped) trend around the
regression line, or clusters of cases. That finding
rules out major violations of a main assumption
of canonical correlation analysis and suggests that
the sample is homogeneous.

DISCUSSION
The results suggest that the three most important
origins of stickiness are the lack of absorptive
capacity of the recipient, causal ambiguity, and
an arduous relationship between the source and
the recipient. Those three constructs represent
knowledge barriers. Indeed, absorptive capacity
is a function of the recipient's knowledge endowment prior to the transfer, causal ambiguity
reflects the recipient's depth of knowledge or
irreducible uncertainty
about cause-effect
relationships, and the quality of the relationship
affects the recipient's ability to acquire knowledge when needed (i.e., the relationship serves
as a conduit for knowledge).
It is interesting to contrast these results with
conventional wisdom, which attributes stickiness
almost exclusively to motivational factors. Indeed,
practitioners typically cite as barriers interdivisional jealousy, lack of incentives, lack of confidence, low priority, lack of buy-in, an incli-

<-----Page 11----->Exploring Internal Stickiness
nation to reinvent the wheel or to plow the same
fields twice, recipients' refusal to do exactly what
they are told, resistance to change, lack of commitment, turf protection, and of course the NIH
syndrome.
Researchers who have looked at the phenomenon from a general management perspective
seem to agree with the dominant view of practitioners. For example, Porter (1985: 352), notes
that 'the mere hope that one business unit might
learn something useful from another is frequently
a hope not realized.' He blames both the recipient, who can 'rarely be expected to seek out
know-how elsewhere in the firm,' and also the
source, who 'will have little incentive to transfer
[know-how], particularly if it involves the time of
some of their best people or involves proprietary
technology that might leak out' (p. 368). Porter's
diagnosis is unequivocal: 'Unless the motivation
system reflects these differences [in perspective],
it will be extremely difficult to get business units
to agree to pursue an interrelationship and to
work together to implement it successfully' (cf.
also Goold, Campbell, and Alexander, 1994:
176).
Yet the statistical findings suggest that knowledge-related barriers-lack of absorptive capacity,
causal ambiguity, the arduousness of the
relationship-clearly dominate motivation-related
barriers. These findings point to sources of difficulty that have received scant systematic attention from researchers and suggest to practitioners
an alternative way to frame the problem of
internal stickiness.
In light of the findings, using only incentive
systems to mitigate internal stickiness-not
unusual in practice-seems inadequate or misled.
The findings suggest that it might be profitable
instead to devote scarce resources and managerial
attention to develop the learning capacities of
organizational units, foster closer relationships
between organizational units, and systematically
understand and communicate practices.
Such an approach could be useful beyond the
domain of best practice transfer. Barriers to the
transfer of skills and capabilities reduce organizational flexibility (cf. Kogut, 1985), the potential
value of an acquisition (cf. Haspeslagh and Jemison, 1991), the chances for the success of strategic alliances, technology partnerships, and technology transfer agreements (cf. Hamel and
Prahalad, 1988; Hamel, Doz, and Prahalad, 1989),

37

and more broadly the ability of an organization
to leverage current knowledge (cf. Bartlett and
Ghoshal, 1989). Researchers and practitioners
who are concerned with those issues may find
that hitherto poorly explained phenomena can be
addressed by examining the impact of knowledge barriers.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The findings of a systematic investigation of
internal stickiness are reported. The research
framework proposes a definition of stickiness
based on the notion of eventfulness and a comprehensive taxonomy of barriers to intrafirm knowledge transfer that is grounded in a tradition pioneered by Arrow. The framework is validated by
canonical correlation analysis with data collected
through a two-step survey. Contrary to conventional wisdom, which blames motivational factors
almost exclusively for internal stickiness, the
findings suggest that knowledge-related barriersrecipient's lack of absorptive capacity, causal
ambiguity, and the arduousness of the relationship
between source and recipient-are most important
impediments to knowledge transfer within the
firm.
The limitations of the study call for caution
in deriving implications from the findings. The
correlational design precludes strong imputations
of causality, and survival bias influenced the
selection of transfers because problematic or
aborted transfers remained elusive. Yet the study
is one of the most extensive systematic investigations of internal stickiness, and the first to
seek a balanced perspective by triangulating the
perceptions of the source, the recipient, and an
external observer of the transfer. Further, because
general theoretical criteria were used to select the
companies and the practices for study, the findings should be broadly generalizable to situations
in which the knowledge being transferred is
already in use. The convergent and discriminant
validity in and among the constructs, the strength
of the canonical correlation, and the clear and
rather substantial differences between the canonical weights attached to knowledge and motivation
factors enhance the plausibility of the results.
A major motivation for the study was to
explain the persistence of the best practices
puzzle-why, though one would expect visible

<-----Page 12----->best practices to be recommended by superiors
and emulated by peers, those practices do not
spread inside firms (cf. Walton, 1975). This
puzzle raises a fundamental question for the
knowledge-based view of the firm-why organizations do not know what they know. When best
practice does not transfer, a gap develops between
what is known within the organization and what
is actually put to use. The findings of the study
suggest that it may be less because organizations
do not want to learn what they know but rather
because they do not know how to. Conventional
wisdom after all may have led to a blind alley.
Pursuing knowledge-related factors-that
is,
devoting scarce resources and managerial attention to develop the learning capacities of organizational units, to foster closer relationships
between organizational units, and to systematically understand and communicate practices-is
perhaps a promising alternative worthy of future
research.

APPENDIX 1: OPERATIONALIZATION
OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLEFIVE MEASURES OF STICKINESS
Each sentence in the description of the scales
below is the full text of the question as it
appears in the questionnaire. Additional explanation is supplied for the outcome-based measure of stickiness.
*Unless otherwise indicated, answers were
scored by using the default scale (Y! Y o N
N!).
Key for the default scale: Y! = 'yes!'; Y = 'yes,
but'; o = 'no opinion'; N = 'no, not really', N!
= 'No!'
The overall score for each scale was computed
by adding the standardized scores obtained from
each question.

Stickiness-outcome-based measure (a= 0.8,
Items = 8)
Stickiness was measured with a set of eight items
corresponding to the so-called technical success
indicators of a project (Pinto and Mantel, 1990;
Randolph and Posner, 1988)-on
time, on
budget, and a satisfied recipient. Deviation in
timing was measured as departure from the initial
plan in reaching key milestones-the
start of
the transfer, the first day the practice became
operational at the recipient and achievement of
satisfactory performance. For these three items
the five possible answers were 1: ADVANCED BY
MORE THAN ONE MONTH, 2: ADVANCED LESS
THAN ONE MONTH, 3: NOT RESCHEDULED, 4:

5: DELAYED
Two items measured
departure of actual cost from expected cost on
the source side and the recipient side. For these

three items measured recipient's satisfaction. One
item measured adjustment in the recipient's
expectations after gaining experience with the
practice. The possible answers for this question
were 1: DRAMATICALLY UPWARD, 2: SLIGHTLY
UPWARD, 3: NO CHANGE, 4: SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD, 5: DRAMATICALLY DOWNWARD. Two items
measured whether the recipient was satisfied with
the quality of the practice and with the quality
of the transfer. For these two items, the possible
answers were 1: VERY SATISFIED, 2: SOMEWHAT
SATISFIED, 3: NEITHER SATISFIED NOR DISSATISFIED, 4: SOMEWHAT DISSATISFIED, 5: VERY DISSATISFIED.

Ranking the performance of <company +'s units
on their results on <practice+ was straightforward. Within <compaizy+ there existed consensus that <source+ has obtained the best results
with <practice+. Compared to external benchmarks, <source+ has obtained best-in-class
results with <practice+. <source+ could easily
explain how it obtained superior results with
<practice+. <source+ could easily point to the
key components of <practice +. 4 source+ was
reluctant to share crucial knowledge and information relative to <practice+. Distributing
responsibility for the transfer between <source+
and @recipient+ generated much conflict. The
transfer of <practice+ from <source+ to
<recipient+ was amply justified.

of the transfer of <practice+ from <source+
to <recipient+ were carefully planned.

Stickiness-process-based measure: Ramp-up

Initially <recipient+ 'spoon fed' the <practice+

measured performance more often than usual,
sometimes reacting too briskly to transient
declines in performance. Some people left
<recipient+ after having been trained for their
new role in the <practice+, forcing <recipient+
to hire hastily a replacement and train it 'on the

forcing <recipient+ to hire hastily a replacement

unsatisfactory side effects which <recipient+ had

APPENDIX 2: OPERATIONALIZATION
OF THE INDEPENDENT
VARIABLES-ORIGINS OF
STICKINESS
The description of the scales follows the same
convention used in Appendix 1 for dependent
variables.

Causal ambiguity (a= 0.86, Items = 6),
default scale
The limits of the @practice+ are fully specified:
With the @practice+, we know why a given
action results in a given outcome; When a problem surfaced with the @practice+, the precise
reasons for failure could not be articulated even
after the event; There is a precise list of the
skills, resources and prerequisites necessary for
successfully performing the @practice+; It is
well known how the components of that list
output;
interact to produce <practice+'s
Operating procedures for the 6 practice 9 are
available; Useful manuals for the <practice+ are
available; Existing work manuals and operating
procedures describe precisely what people working in the @practice% actually do.

Unproven knowledge ( a= 0.67, Items = 3),
default scale unless indicated
We had solid proof that @practice+ was really
helpful; <practice+ contributes significantly to
the competitive advantage of <company+; For
the success of @company$, the <practice$ is:
1. CRITICAL, 2. VERY IMPORTANT, 3. FAIRLY
IMPORTANT, 4. FAIRLY UNIMPORTANT, 5. N O T
IMPORTANT AT ALL.

Source lacks motivation (a= 0.93,
Items = 13), binary scales
Source saw benefit in: measuring its own performance; understanding its own practices; sharing this understanding with other units; sharing
the limits of this understanding with other units;
assessing the feasibility of the transfer; communicating with <recipient+; planning the transfer;
documenting

transfer;
implementing @recipients's support systems;

personnel; helping
<recipient+ troubleshoot; helping resolve recipient's unexpected problems; lending skilled personnel.

UNIT, @source% was able to accommodate the
needs of <recipient
into <practice+;
<source+ had a hidden agenda; The superior
results of the @source$ were visible; remained
stable; <source+
possessed the necessary
resources to support the transfer; @source+ has
a history of successful transfers.

+

Recipient lacks motivation (a= 0.93,
Items = 14), binary items
Recipient saw benefit in: measuring its own performance; comparing it with the performance of
other units; understanding its own practices;
absorbing <source+'s understanding; analyzing
the feasibility of adopting @practice$; communicating its needs to <source+; planning the transfer; implementing the systems and facilities for

<-----Page 17----->Exploring Internal Stickiness
<practice+, assigning personnel full time to the
transfer; assigning personnel to be trained in
<practice+; understanding the implications of
the transfer; troubleshooting <practice+; insuring
that its people knew their jobs; insuring that its
people consented to keep doing their jobs.

Recipient lacks absorptive capacity (a= 0.83,
Items = 9), default scale
Members of <recipient+ have a common language to deal with the <practice+; <.recipient+
had a vision of what it was trying to achieve
through the transfer; <recipient+ had information on the state-of-the-art of the <practice+;
<recipient+ had a clear division of roles and
responsibilities to implement the <practice+;
<recipient+
had the necessary skills to
implement the <practice+; <recipient+ had the
technical competence to absorb the <practice+;
<recipient+ had the managerial competence to
absorb the <practice+; It is well known who
can best exploit new information about the
<practice+ within <recipient+; It is well
known who can help solve problems associated
with the <practice+.

Recipient lacks retentive capacity (a= 0.81,
Items = 6), default scale
<recipient+ periodically retrains existing personnel on the <practice+; <recipient+ has mechanisms to detect malfunctions of the <practice+;
<recipient+ regularly measures performance and
corrects problems as soon as these happen;
<recipient+'s personnel can predict how they
will be rewarded for good performance in the
<practice+; 4 recipient 9 ' s personnel are provided with numerous opportunities to commit
freely and publicly to perform their role; At
<recipient+ there is a clear focal point for the
<practice a.

Barren organizational context (a= 0.77,

Existing
performance
measures
of
the
<practice+ are detailed enough to be meaningful; Performance measures of the <practice+ are
taken frequently enough to be timely; Perform-

43

ance measures of the <practice+ from different
units are easily comparable; <company +
enforces company-wide standard policies with
respect to the <practice+; At <company+ there
is constant pressure to improve performance; It
is easy to justify time spent visiting other units;
To visit another unit, it is easy to justify travel
expenses; At <company +, improving performance by copying and adapting practices from
other units is as legitimate as improving performance from own creativity. At <company+, a unit
that exposes those needs that it is unable to meet
on its own loses status; At <company+, a unit
that exposes unresolved problems loses status; At
<company+, despite structural differences units
can always learn from one another; Normally a
best-in-class practice is most likely to be found
outside <company 9; At <company +, managers
seem to prefer to use external sources of help
and support even though they are more expensive
and less useful; At <company+, corporate pride
and values encourage managers not to look outside for help or to share with the outside.

Arduous relationship (a= 0.71, Items = 3)
Communication between <source+ and

1. VERY EASY
