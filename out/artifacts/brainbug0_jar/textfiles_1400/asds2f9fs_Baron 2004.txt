Abstract
It is suggested that a cognitive perspective may provide important insights into key aspects of the
entrepreneurial process. Specifically, it is proposed that this perspective—which has yielded
impressive results in many other fields—can help the field of entrepreneurship to answer three basic
questions it has long addressed: (1) Why do some persons but not others choose to become
entrepreneurs? (2) Why do some persons but not others recognize opportunities for new products or
services that can be profitably exploited? (3) Why are some entrepreneurs so much more successful
than others? Specific cognitive factors relevant to each of these questions are identified, and their
potential effects are described. It is suggested that a cognitive perspective can prove beneficial both to
researchers wishing to understand entrepreneurship as a process and to practitioners hoping to assist
entrepreneurs in their efforts to create successful new ventures.

1. Executive summary
The cognitive perspective emphasizes the fact that everything we think, say, or do is
influenced by mental processes—the cognitive mechanisms through which we acquire store,
transform, and use information. It is suggested here that this perspective can be highly useful
to the field of entrepreneurship. Specifically, it can assist the field in answering three basic
questions it has long addressed: (1) Why do some persons but not others choose to become

entrepreneurs? (2) Why do some persons but not others recognize opportunities for new
products or services that can be profitably exploited? And (3) Why are some entrepreneurs so
much more successful than others?
With respect to the first issue, prospect theory, a well-developed theory of decision
making, calls attention to cognitive factors that can influence the decision to become an
entrepreneur. For instance, entrepreneurs may tend to frame many situations in terms of losses
(e.g., they focus on the economic gains they will forego if they do not become entrepreneurs).
This, in turn, may cause them to be relatively risk-seeking. The decision to become an
entrepreneur may also be influenced by several cognitive biases, such as the optimistic bias,
the planning fallacy, and the illusion of control. For instance, persons who choose to become
entrepreneurs may be more likely than others to assume that things will turn out well
(optimistic bias).
Turning to the question of why some persons but not others recognize opportunities that
can be profitably exploited, cognitive factors such as basic perceptual processes (object or
pattern recognition; signal detection theory), a modern framework for understanding how
individuals regulate their own behavior (regulatory focus theory), and the concept of a mental
schema that assists individuals in their search for opportunities (entrepreneurial alertness),
may all play a role.
Cognitive factors can also affect entrepreneurs’ success. Entrepreneurs may be more adept
than other persons at using counterfactual thinking (imagining what might have been) to
develop improved task strategies, and they may be better at knowing when to switch from the
quick and effortless processing of information (heuristic processing) to more effortful and
analytic thought (systematic processing). Finally, successful entrepreneurs may be more adept
at avoiding various cognitive ‘‘traps’’ such as sunk costs.
Overall, the cognitive perspective can provide valuable tools for the field of entrepreneurship—tools that may contribute both to the field’s scientific understanding of the
entrepreneurial process and to practical efforts to assist entrepreneurs in their efforts to start
new ventures.

2. Introduction
Like all the other authors whose papers are included in this special issue, I am a
psychologist by training. In addition, however, I have another identity: I am also an
entrepreneur (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). About 10 years ago, I had an idea for a
new product—a special kind of air cleaner. I obtained two U.S. patents on this idea and then
started a company to develop it. Ultimately, I worked with a large manufacturer to bring the
product to market and it was sold on TV, in stores, and through advertisements in magazines
such as The Smithsonian. The product had a limited life cycle, so after 7 years—almost all of
them profitable—the company ceased operations. I learned a great deal from this experience,
but one thing I certainly gained was a greater appreciation of the following point: trying to
understand the entrepreneurial process without considering entrepreneurs is like trying to
bake bread without yeast—an essential ingredient that makes the entire process happen is

<-----Page 2----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

223

missing. As Shane et al. (in press) have recently noted, entrepreneurship arises, ultimately,
from the actions of particular persons; consequently, understanding why and how these
persons act as they do is crucial to comprehending the entire process.
This point leads, logically, to the central thesis of this paper: a cognitive perspective (e.g.,
Matlin, 2002) can be invaluable to the field of entrepreneurship because it can assist us in our
efforts to understand entrepreneurs and their role in the entrepreneurial process. In essence,
the cognitive perspective emphasizes the fact that everything we think, say, or do as human
beings is influenced by mental processes—by the cognitive mechanisms through which we
acquire information, enter it into storage, transform it, and use it to accomplish a wide range
of tasks (e.g., making decisions, solving problems; Sternberg, 1999).
The remainder of this paper will focus on the many ways in which a cognitive perspective
can assist entrepreneurship in answering three basic questions that have long been central to
the field:
1. Why do some persons but not others choose to become entrepreneurs?
2. Why do some persons but not others recognize opportunities for new products or services
that can be profitably exploited?
3. Why are some entrepreneurs so much more successful than others?
Ways in which a cognitive perspective can contribute to answering each of these questions
will be considered in the sections that follow. Before beginning, however, it is important to
note that there is no intention here of suggesting that cognitive processes are the entire story
where entrepreneurs are concerned, or that entrepreneurs are all that matters from the point of
view of understanding the entrepreneurial process. Other factors relating to entrepreneurs,
such as their motives, skills, abilities, and traits, also play a role (e.g., Baron, in press; Shane
et al., in press). Further, entrepreneurship as a process is strongly affected by a host of
economic and societal factors too (e.g., Zahara and Bogner, 2000). So to repeat: it is not being
suggested here that entrepreneurs are ‘‘all there that there is.’’ Having clarified that key point,
the remainder of this discussion will now focus on the basic theme stated above, which
translates directly into the following question: ‘‘How can understanding entrepreneurs’
cognitive processes contribute to answering the three ‘why’ questions posed earlier?’’

3. Why do some persons but not others choose to become entrepreneurs?
Why did I, personally, decide to become an entrepreneur—to risk my time, accumulated
wealth, and energy, in an effort to bring a new product to market? Clearly, many factors
played a role. It seems very unlikely that I would ever have decided to adopt this course of
action if I had not previously been exposed to actual entrepreneurs, either directly through
personal contact, or indirectly through the media. In fact, I had observed entrepreneurs in both
contexts: my grandfather started and ran a successful manufacturing company, and like
almost everyone else in the American society, I had read countless reports describing the
experiences of entrepreneurs in the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, and other sources. In

<-----Page 3----->224

R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

addition, my own teaching led me to contemplate the role of entrepreneur; for instance, I
often showed the film ‘‘Triumph of the Nerds’’ in my undergraduate classes. So clearly, I had
acquired basic knowledge of the role of entrepreneurship from my own prior experience.
Motivational factors, too, probably played a role. In a recent review of theory and research
relating to this issue, Shane et al. (in press) called attention to the fact that the entrepreneurial
process occurs because people actively choose to pursue opportunities they have identified.
Thus, the decision to become an entrepreneur is an initial and crucial step in the process. One
aspect of motivation that appears to play a role in the decision to become an entrepreneur is
self-efficacy—belief in one’s ability to muster and implement necessary resources, skills, and
competencies to attain a certain level of achievement on a given task (Bandura, 1997).
Evidence for the importance of this factor has been reported by Markman et al. (2001), who
found that self-efficacy was a strong predictor of the decision by patent holders to start a new
venture. In other words, the higher the patent holders’ generalized self-efficacy (i.e., selfefficacy across a wide range of tasks contexts), the more likely they were to start new
ventures rather than simply license their inventions to others. Similarly, Baum (1994)
examined the effects of a number of factors, including positive affectivity, specific skills
and competencies, and situation-specific motivation (e.g., goal-setting, self-efficacy as
possible predictors of firm growth). Results indicated that self-efficacy (defined in terms of
confidence in one’s ability to grow the company) was the strongest single predictor of growth
in the industry studied (wood products).
While knowledge of the entrepreneurial role, motivational factors, and many other
variables, too, influence the decision to become an entrepreneur, it is the central thesis of
this paper that cognitive factors play a crucial role in this respect. Thus, the remainder of this
section will examine several aspects of human cognition that may strongly affect individuals’
decision to become—or not become—entrepreneurs.
3.1. Perceptions of risk and predictions derived from prospect theory
Because it has received a large amount of attention in the entrepreneurship literature, we
will begin with perceptions of risk. Most new ventures fail within a few years—that is a basic
fact. Yet, most entrepreneurs are confident about their own chances of success. In a sense,
they suffer from a strong optimistic bias (e.g., Shepperd et al., 1996), believing that their
likelihood of experiencing positive outcomes is much higher than objective data suggest. One
important basis for this unwarranted optimism is the tendency of persons who choose to
become entrepreneurs to underestimate the amount of risk involved in starting a new venture.
When compared to other persons, entrepreneurs do not appear to be ‘‘riskier’’—they do not
have a higher overall propensity or tolerance for risk (e.g., Kahneman and Lovallo, 1994).
But because of additional cognitive tendencies (e.g., an inflated illusion of control; Simon et
al., 2000), they tend to perceive existing risks as smaller than they are and smaller in
magnitude than other persons do. This, in turn, contributes significantly to their willingness to
‘‘take the plunge’’ and start a new venture.
Additional insights into the role of cognitive factors in the initial decision to become an
entrepreneur are provided by prospect theory—an influential theory of decision making

<-----Page 4----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

225

which has been applied to many business contexts (e.g., Plous, 1993; Tversky and Khaneman, 1982). The theory centers around the concept of subjective value—gains or losses
defined in terms of a reference point. A key assumption of the theory is that the function
relating losses to subjective value is steeper than the function relating gains to subjective
value. This means that for any given magnitude, losses tend to ‘‘loom larger’’ than gains in
the thinking of individuals and in their decisions. For example, a loss of US$10,000 is felt
more strongly (has a larger negative value) than a gain of US$10,000, even though the
amounts involved are identical. This disparity in the value function for gains and losses leads
to the prediction—confirmed in many studies—that people tend to be risk-averse with respect
to gains but risk-seeking with respect to losses. In other words, they prefer to avoid risk when
they focus on (think about) gains, but seek risk when they focus on (think about) losses. Here
is a concrete example: when asked which they prefer, a 50% chance of losing US$1000 or a
certain loss of US$500, a large majority of persons choose the former despite the fact that the
expected value are identical in both cases; they are risk-seeking since this choice is framed in
terms of losses. However, when asked whether they prefer a certain gain of US$500 or a 50%
chance of gaining US$1000, most prefer the former; since they are focused on gains, they are
risk-averse and prefer the ‘‘sure thing.’’
Since gains and losses are defined in terms of a reference point, and since different persons
can have contrasting reference points (which can also shift over time), prospect theory has
interesting implications for the process of entrepreneurship. It is possible, for example, that
persons who choose to become entrepreneurs tend to frame many situations in terms of
losses; that is, they focus on the possibilities for economic gains they will forfeit if they
ignore or overlook an opportunity and continue to work for an existing organization. To the
extent they focus on losses, they will tend to be risk-seeking, so for them, starting a new
venture is a preferred choice; after all, it is preferable to the certain losses they will incur by
remaining where they are and not starting a business. This prediction has not yet been
investigated in empirical research, but can readily be tested using methodology long
employed to study other predictions derived from prospect theory (e.g., Plous, 1993).
Another aspect of this theory offers additional intriguing predictions. Briefly, the theory
suggests that people overweight small probabilities but underweight moderate and high
probabilities. This tendency is shown by millions of people who play state lotteries: the
chances of winning are miniscule, but in the minds of ticket purchasers, these low probabilities
of positive outcomes become inflated. This principle may apply to the decision to become an
entrepreneur. Individuals who make this choice may show the tendency to overweight small
probabilities to a greater extent than other persons, and this leads them to hold enhanced
estimates of their own success. Perhaps it is this factor which leads nascent entrepreneurs to risk
their time, fortunes, and careers in starting new ventures—an activity which, from a purely
rational perspective, has a very low probability of success (e.g., Kolchinski, 2001).
A large body of research on prospect theory exists, and some of the measures employed in
this work can be readily adapted for use with entrepreneurs. The main point is simply this:
prospect theory and other theories of decision making may provide important insights into the
question of why some people, and not others, choose to become entrepreneurs. Such theories
answer this question in terms of differences between entrepreneurs and other persons with

<-----Page 5----->226

R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

respect to basic cognitive processes—processes often omitted from economic models of
entrepreneurship.
3.2. The role of cognitive biases
Although we can all imagine a being such as Mr. Spock of Star Trek fame—an individual
who is completely rational (or at least claims to be!)—this is an ideal we can never hope to
attain as human beings. Decades of research indicate that our cognitive processes (thinking,
deciding, planning, etc.) are far from totally rational (e.g., Sternberg, 1999). On the contrary,
our thinking and everything that stems from it, is often strongly affected by various errors or
biases. For example, we tend to suffer from a strong confirmation bias: information that
confirms our current beliefs (or, at least is consistent with them) is noticed, processed, and
remembered more readily than information that disconfirms our current beliefs (e.g.,
Johnson-Laird, 1999). Similarly, we suffer a strong tendency to weight negative information
more heavily than positive information in a wide range of contexts. (e.g., Kunda, 1999).
The existence of these and many other sources of cognitive error, and their powerful and
generalized impact upon our thought, suggests that perhaps the decision to become an
entrepreneur, too, may be influenced by such factors (e.g., Baron, 1998; Busenitz and Barney,
1997; Simon et al., 2000.). What specific cognitive errors might affect this decision? Likely
candidates include the optimistic bias—an inflated tendency to expect things to turn out well
(Shepperd et al., 1996), the planning fallacy—the tendency to believe that we can complete
more in a given period of time than we actually can (Buehler et al., 1994), and affect
infusion—the tendency for our affective states to strongly influence (and often to distort) our
perceptions and decisions (e.g., Forgas, 1995). Entrepreneurs, in comparison to other persons,
may be more susceptible to such biases. This, in turn, may lead them to anticipate favorable
results to a greater extent than is justified (e.g., they believe they can complete more in a
given time than they actually can, or that the likelihood of success is higher than it really is).
Research findings offer support for the suggestion that various forms of cognitive bias play
a role in the decision to become an entrepreneur. For example, in one recent study, Simon et
al. (2000) found that for a large sample of MBA students, the stronger the students’ illusion of
control (belief that their skill could increase performance even in situations where chance
plays a large role) and the stronger the students’ belief in the law of small numbers (the
tendency to use a small sample of information as a basis for firm conclusions), the greater
their tendency to start a new venture. These and related findings suggest that careful attention
to the potential impact of cognitive biases may indeed shed new light on the question of why
some persons, but not others, choose to start new ventures. The cognitive perspective can be
useful to the field of entrepreneurship in this important respect.

4. Why do some persons but not others recognize opportunities?
Identification of a viable economic opportunity is an important initial step in the
entrepreneurial process. In fact, entrepreneurs’ decisions to found new ventures often stem

<-----Page 6----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

227

from their belief that they have identified an opportunity no one else has yet recognized and
so can benefit from being first to enter the marketplace. (Interestingly, however, growing
evidence suggests that being an early follower may be more advantageous than being first in
terms of order of entry into a market; Durand and Coerurderoy, 2001).
Opportunity recognition has long been a central concept in the field of entrepreneurship,
but until recently, little effort has been made to examine this topic from a cognitive
perspective (important work by Kirzner, 1979 and subsequent extensions and advances by
Gaglio and Katz, 2001, described below, constitute an important exception to this general
pattern). Instead, opportunities have been viewed largely in economic terms, with a resulting
focus on such issues as the potential for gain relative to costs or risk. It seems clear, however,
that our understanding of opportunity recognition may be increased by considering it from a
cognitive perspective.
4.1. The role of perceptual processes: opportunity recognition as pattern recognition
First, it seems clear that perception plays a role. When an entrepreneur identifies an
opportunity (and let us assume for the moment that the opportunity does in fact exist), this
implies that there is ‘‘something’’ out there to notice—some kind of stimulus or stimulus
configuration that can be noticed or perceived. Much basic research on perception has
focused on this task, which is known as object or pattern recognition: identification of a
complex array of stimuli which, together, allow perceivers to recognize an object or a
complex pattern of objects or events (e.g., Matlin, 2002). If it is assumed that opportunities
must, at some level, actually exist as discernible patterns or configurations of observable
stimuli (something that potential entrepreneurs can actually observe), then the findings of
basic research on object recognition may be relevant to understanding this process. In other
words, such research may provide insights into the nature of the stimulus configurations that
are identified as opportunities—in other words, into the essential nature of opportunities from
the point of view of the entrepreneur. This is a very basic question that, to date, has been
largely ignored.
It is important to note that this approach is opposite to one suggesting that all opportunities
are unique and that no underlying similarities exist between them. The presence of highly
successful repeat entrepreneurs raises doubts about this interpretation. Such persons often
recognize opportunities that, at first glance, seem entirely unrelated to one another. This
suggests that at some basic level, diverse and seemingly unrelated opportunities do indeed
share recognizable components. Again, however, this question, which seems crucial to the
task of understanding the essential nature of opportunities and the processes through which
they are recognized, has not yet been addressed in empirical research.
Putting this issue aside for the moment, it seems useful to consider the basic findings of
research on object or pattern recognition. Such work suggests that human beings accomplish
this task through a number of interrelated processes. Considering these may shed light on the
processes that play a role in opportunity recognition. One such process is described by
feature-analysis models (e.g., Larsen and Bundesen, 1996). These models suggest that objects
or complex patterns of events are identified in terms of their distinctive features. These

<-----Page 7----->228

R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

distinctive features are stored in memory, and new stimuli that individuals encounter are
compared with these features for purposes of identification. Consider, for instance, letters of
the alphabet. Here, distinctive features include vertical lines, diagonal lines, and curved
components. We can distinguish between the letter R and the letter K because only the former
has a curved component. Evidence for the accuracy of feature-analysis models is compelling.
For example, neuroscience research suggests that within the visual cortex, different groups of
neurons respond primarily to horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines (Hubel and Wiesel,
1979).
What might be the distinctive features for opportunities? Newness might be one; nascent
entrepreneurs (or experienced ones, too), may compare new ideas with an existing concept of
‘‘newness’’ stored in memory in order to determine whether a new stimulus configuration
should be identified as an opportunity. Similarly, practicality may constitute another
distinctive feature. Only ideas that exhibit this feature are identified as being bona fide
opportunities. A third distinctive feature might be novelty or uniqueness—only ideas for new
products or services, which do not currently exist, are identified as being opportunities. These
suggestions are, of course, largely speculative. But if recognition of opportunities proceeds,
even in part, through feature analysis, then it should, in principle, be possible to identify the
distinctive features used by entrepreneurs to determine whether a new idea is, or is not, an
opportunity.
While feature-analysis models of object or pattern recognition are useful, they suffer from
one major drawback: they are primarily applicable to identifying relatively simple objects or
patterns. In contrast, prototype models of object or pattern recognition apply to more complex
objects or patterns and so may be more relevant to the process of opportunity recognition.
Such models suggest that through experience, we construct prototypes; each representing a
set or category of objects (or patterns). In a sense, such prototypes comprise our basic ideas of
what a specific object or pattern is like—its essential nature. For instance, most persons
possess a prototype for ‘‘house.’’ This mental abstraction is broad enough so that everything
from a huge mansion to a simple cottage can be recognized as a house, while other objects
that do not match this prototype well (e.g., tents, skyscrapers, and shopping malls) are
excluded. Prototypes seem to be based on, and to represent, the mode or most frequently
experienced combination of attributes associated with an object or pattern (e.g., Solso, 1999).
Thus, for example, the prototype of ‘‘house’’ would probably include such attributes as
windows, doors, rooms in which to sleep, eat, and wash, a roof or other protection from rain,
and so on.
Applying prototype models to opportunity recognition, it may be the case that entrepreneurs
compare ideas for new products or services with their existing prototype for ‘‘opportunity’’—a
mental abstraction they have acquired through experience. Such a prototype might encompass a
combination of attributes such as newness, novelty, practicality, the ease with which it can be
described to venture capitalists, the likelihood of competitors, appeal to a specific, identifiable
market, and so on. According to such models, opportunity recognition would involve
comparison of ideas for new products or services with existing prototypes of opportunity;
the closer the match, the more likely would entrepreneurs be to conclude that an idea for a new
product or service does indeed constitute an opportunity worth pursuing.

<-----Page 8----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

229

Other theoretical models of object or pattern recognition exist (e.g., the recognition-bycomponents models; Biederman, 1995), but feature-analysis models and prototype models are
among the ones that are most widely accepted. Together, such models call attention to the fact
to date, that researchers in the field of entrepreneurship have largely ignored the following
basic questions: (1) What patterns of discernible stimuli are recognized by entrepreneurs as
constituting opportunities? In other words, what is an opportunity, from a perceptual point of
view? And (2) What cognitive processes play a role in this task? Answers to these questions
may prove invaluable to the field of entrepreneurship in its efforts to address the question:
‘‘Why do some persons but not others identify opportunities?’’
4.2. Opportunity recognition: insights from signal detection theory and regulatory focus
theory
Theories of object recognition are concerned primarily with the processes through which
human beings identify various objects or patterns. In a sense, these theories assume that an
even more basic task has been accomplished: deciding whether there is anything ‘‘out there’’
to identify. Obviously, only if a stimulus exists can it be identified as being a specific kind of
object or pattern (e.g., an opportunity or, alternatively, ‘‘a dead-end’’). This is a crucial task
and one we often wish to perform very accurately. Perhaps a concrete example will help to
illustrate why this is so and why this question is directly relevant to the issue of opportunity
recognition.
Consider a highway engineer who is inspecting a bridge. His observations suggest that a
serious structural flaw may be present, but because of inconclusive data, this is far from
certain. What does the engineer do next? Conducting further tests is a conservative way to
proceed, but what if, while these tests are continuing and the bridge remains open, it suddenly
collapses? The result may be a tragic loss of life. On the other hand, if the engineer closes the
bridge immediately and further tests reveal that no flaw exists, the wrath of the driving public
will be aroused; the bridge was closed and traffic disrupted, for no real reason.
Many life situations pose this kind of dilemma, and in the fields of perception and decision
making, it has often been studied in the context of signal detection theory (Swets, 1992).
Briefly, this theory suggests that in situations where individuals attempt to determine whether
a stimulus is present or absent, four possibilities exist: the stimulus does exist and the
perceiver concludes that it is present (this is known as a hit or correct identification); the
stimulus does exist but the perceiver fails to recognize it (this is known as a miss); the
stimulus does not exist and the perceiver concludes, erroneously, that it is present (this is a
false alarm); the stimulus does not exist and the perceiver correctly concludes that it is not
present (a correct rejection—another kind of hit).
The theory further notes that many factors determine the relative rate at which individuals
experience hits, misses, and false alarms in any given situation. Some of these are physical
and relate to the properties of the stimuli (e.g., the stronger the stimulus, in physical terms, the
easier it is to be certain that it is present). Other factors, however, relate to the current state of
the perceiver (e.g., Is this person fatigued, highly, or weakly motivated to make correct
determinations?). Still, other factors involve the subjective criteria perceivers apply to the

<-----Page 9----->230

R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

task. Consider the highway engineer: since experiencing public censure is preferable to being
responsible for the deaths of many motorists, the engineer would probably set his or her
criterion for concluding that there is a flaw in the bridge (for deciding that he has in fact
perceived a stimulus) quite low. In other words, even weak signals (i.e., weak indications of a
flaw in the bridge) would be viewed as sufficient evidence for concluding that the stimulus is
present for closing the bridge. The engineer, in brief, would much rather experience false
alarms than misses and acts accordingly.
In other situations, in contrast, quite the opposite might be true. For instance, consider the
case of a radiologist examining medical scans in order to determine whether a cancerous
tumor is or is not present in an elderly patient. The radiologist does not want to overlook
tumors that exist (that would constitute a miss), but the costs of false alarms, too, are very
high: the patient will be subjected to serious surgery with considerable risks, when in fact
there is no reason for this procedure. Under these circumstances, the radiologist may be more
cautious than the highway engineer and set a more stringent criterion for concluding that a
stimulus is present (i.e., for reaching the conclusion ‘‘yes, there is a tumor, and surgery is
necessary’’). Deaths resulting from unnecessary operations are certainly more costly than
complaints from an irate public about traffic inconvenience.
While signal detection theory itself appears to be relevant to opportunity recognition, it
makes even more compelling predictions when combined with another framework—one that
has received growing attention in recent years in cognitive science. This framework is known
as regulatory focus theory, and it is described in detail in the article by Brockner et al. (2003).
Briefly, the theory suggests that in regulating their own behavior to achieve desired ends,
individuals adopt one of two contrasting perspectives (e.g., Higgins, 1998). In the first,
known as a promotion focus, the ultimate goal sought by individuals is accomplishment—
attaining positive outcomes. When they adopt this regulatory focus, persons seek to generate
many hypotheses and to explore all possible means to reaching the goals they desire. In the
second, known as a prevention focus, the ultimate goal sought is safety—avoiding negative
outcomes. Thus, when individuals adopt this latter regulatory focus, they tend to generate
fewer hypotheses and focus primarily on avoiding mistakes—actions or decisions that will
produce negative outcomes. Many studies (e.g., Higgins and Silberman, 1998) indicate that
individuals differ in their chronic preferences for a promotion or prevention focus. In
addition, individuals can be induced to adopt one or the other of these two foci by situational
factors (e.g., instructions to focus either on achieving gains or avoiding losses; Liberman et
al., 1999).
Regulatory focus theory is relevant, in several respects, to signal detection theory.
Specifically, it suggests that when individuals adopt a promotion focus (an emphasis on
accomplishment), they concentrate on hits (on recognizing a stimulus when it is present) and
on avoiding misses (failing to recognize a stimulus that is in fact present). In contrast, the
theory suggests that when individuals adopt a prevention focus (an emphasis on avoiding
negative outcomes), they tend to concentrate on avoiding errors; thus, they are especially
vigilant to attain correct rejections (correctly concluding that the stimulus is not present
when it is indeed absent) and to avoid false alarms (concluding that a stimulus is present
when it is not).

<-----Page 10----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

231

These predictions, in turn, have clear implications for the process of opportunity
identification by prospective entrepreneurs. Specifically, persons who adopt a promotion
focus, as compared to those who adopt a prevention focus, are more likely to engage in a
broad and vigorous search for opportunities and to generate many hypotheses concerning
potential opportunities. Further, they tend to set lower criteria for concluding that an
opportunity exists. While this may result in many false alarms, it also increases the odds
that opportunities that actually exist will be recognized. Overall, then, the greater the
individuals’ chronic disposition to adopt a promotion focus, the more likely they are to
identify opportunities. In contrast, persons who adopt a prevention focus are more likely to be
vigilant for false alarms and for correct rejections; they tend to set higher criteria for
concluding that an opportunity exists and generate fewer hypotheses concerning the existence
of opportunities. This suggests that in general, entrepreneurs may be more likely to adopt a
promotion focus than other persons.
Individually, these two theories (signal detection theory; regulatory focus theory) make
intriguing predictions concerning opportunity recognition by entrepreneurs. When combined,
however, they provide an even more powerful tool for answering one of entrepreneurship’s
basic ‘‘why’’ questions: ‘‘Why are some entrepreneurs better than others at identifying viable
opportunities?’’ Regulatory focus theory suggests, as noted above, that all entrepreneurs—
both successful and unsuccessful—show a preference for adopting a promotion focus: both
groups are primarily oriented toward accomplishment and both seek to generate many
hypotheses they can test in their efforts to obtain positive outcomes. But a key difference
between ones who are especially adept at selecting viable opportunities and ones who are less
successful at this task may involve the fact that those in the former (highly successful) group
temper this promotion focus with some aspects of a prevention focus (e.g., concern over
avoiding false alarms). In contrast, entrepreneurs who are less successful at identifying viable
opportunities may tend to adopt a pure promotion focus: they show much less concern over
avoiding negative results. In more specific terms, both groups of entrepreneurs show high
motivation to maximize hits—to correctly notice opportunities that do in fact exist. However,
those who are more adept at distinguishing between truly excellent opportunities and less
viable ones are also more concerned with correctly avoiding false alarms, more concerned
with making correct rejections (correctly recognizing that opportunities do not exist when in
fact they do), and less concerned about misses—overlooking opportunities that are actually
present (successful entrepreneurs realize that there are always new opportunities available, so
they do not waste time experiencing regrets over ones they have failed to notice; refer to the
earlier discussion of counterfactual thinking). These and related predictions are summarized
in Table 1 (see the paper by Brockner et al., 2003 for further discussion of the implications of
regulatory focus theory for various stages of the entrepreneurial process.)
4.3. The potential role of schemas: entrepreneurial alertness schemas
Before concluding this discussion of cognitive factors in opportunity recognition, attention
should be focused on excellent recent work by Gaglio and Katz (2001). Drawing on the
concept of alertness (Kirzner, 1979, p.48)—the ability to notice, without search, opportunities

that have hitherto been overlooked—Gaglio and Katz (2001) suggest that entrepreneurs, and
especially successful entrepreneurs, may possess a schema (mental framework) they term
entrepreneurial alertness. This is a cognitive framework that assists such persons in being
alert to opportunities. More specifically, Gaglio and Katz (2001) hypothesize that persons
who possess such a schema show a tendency to search for and notice change and market
disequilibria, to respond to information that does not match their current schemas, and to
adjust existing schemas on the basis of such nonmatching information. In addition, alert
persons seek to be objectively accurate and possess more complex schemas about change,
their industry, and social environments than nonalert persons. In sum, because of their
complex and adaptive mental frameworks, entrepreneurially alert individuals will be more
able to ‘‘think outside the box’’ than persons lower in alertness (in a sense, they may be
higher on what Sternberg, 2003 has described as successful intelligence). These suggestions
are not at all inconsistent with predictions derived from regulatory focus theory. Indeed, it is
possible that the complex schemas concerning opportunities possessed by alert individuals
may derive, at least in part, from their adoption of a promotion focus across a wide range of
situations and the wealth of ideas and hypotheses this orientation tends to generate.
In sum, basic research on various aspects of human cognition ranging from perception
(object and pattern recognition, signal detection theory) through complex schemas (entrepreneurial alertness) and the self-regulation of behavior (regulatory focus theory) may add
much to efforts to understand how individual entrepreneurs identify viable opportunities for
new products and services. Clearly, this is an important way in which a cognitive perspective
can contribute to the field of entrepreneurship.

5. Why are some entrepreneurs more successful than others?
That a large proportion of new ventures fail is clear; indeed, more than half vanish within a
few years of being founded (Cooper et al., 1989). Yet others go on to major success and
generate large amounts of wealth for their founders, many employees, and the communities in
which they are located. This raises a question that is central to the field of entrepreneurship:
What factors play a role in the financial success of new ventures? Clearly, the answer to this
question is complex and involves a very large number of variables. Some of these are external
to the new companies and are largely economic in nature. For instance, the success of new

<-----Page 12----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

233

ventures depends heavily on the state of the economy and capital markets at the time they are
launched, actions and strategies adopted by competitors, changes in government policies and
regulations that impinge on the new venture or its products, and a host of other economic and
technological conditions (e.g., Shane, in press). Other factors that influence the success of
new ventures, however, may well involve the actions of entrepreneurs—the decisions they
make, the strategies they develop, the style of leadership they exercise, and so on. Needless to
say, cognitive processes play a key role in all of these activities. Consequently, applying a
cognitive perspective may provide important insights into this important aspect of the
entrepreneurial process. Several of the cognitive factors and processes that may prove
especially relevant in this regard are examined below.
5.1. Contrasting perceptions of risk
One possible difference in the cognitive processes of successful and unsuccessful
entrepreneurs—contrasting perceptions of risk—has already been considered in an earlier
section of this paper. Thus, it will only be examined briefly here (e.g., Simon et al., 2000). As
noted earlier, it has long been assumed that entrepreneurs are more accepting of risk than
other persons or, at least, that they perceive lower risk in various situations than nonentrepreneurs (e.g., Kahneman and Lovallo, 1994). Extending this reasoning, it can be
suggested that successful entrepreneurs are better able than unsuccessful ones to hold this
tendency in check. In other words, they are better than unsuccessful entrepreneurs at
accurately gauging the risk associated with various strategies or courses of action and as a
result, are more adept at choosing appropriately between them. Effective decision making by
entrepreneurs with respect to actions involving risk could, of course, play an important role in
the success of new ventures.
Some empirical findings in the entrepreneurship literature offer support for the possibility
that successful entrepreneurs are indeed more effective at this task. For example, Forlani and
Mullins (2000) found that while entrepreneurs are willing to accept a considerable degree of
hazard (possible downside) in business contexts, they tend to avoid high levels of variability
in predicted outcomes for a new venture. In other words, they seem to prefer a degree of
predictability where risk is concerned; they do not necessarily reject high risk, but will accept
it only when it is accompanied by a relatively restricted range of predicted outcomes.
Similarly, in commenting on the finding that entrepreneurs tend to perceive lower risk than
others in various situations, Simon et al. (2000) note that effectiveness at decision making has
been found to be an important factor in the performance of new ventures. Together, these
findings suggest that proficiency on the part of entrepreneurs in accurately assessing risk may
indeed be one cognitive factor that influences the success of new ventures.
5.2. Counterfactual thinking
Another aspect of cognition that may distinguish between relatively successful and
unsuccessful entrepreneurs is counterfactual thinking—the tendency to imagine different
outcomes in a given situation than what actually occurred (i.e., ‘‘what might have been’’; e.g.,

<-----Page 13----->234

R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

Roese, 1997). Research on the effects of counterfactual thinking suggests that it offers a
mixed bag of benefits and potential costs in many contexts, including business settings. On
the negative side, engaging in such thought often leads to feelings of regret about actions not
performed or actions that were performed but which yielded negative results. Such feelings
are unpleasant and can interfere with task performance in a wide range of settings (e.g.,
Roese, 1997). On the positive side of the ledger, engaging in counterfactual thinking
sometimes induces individuals to consider past events from the perspective of constructing
more effective strategies—ones more likely to generate positive outcomes on future occasions
than the actions or strategies actually adopted in the past. Since new ventures have limited
resources, failures by entrepreneurs to learn from their mistakes in this way can be disastrous.
Further, research on organizational learning and improvisation suggests that the more
effectively organizations learn (i.e., profit from their experience and pass this knowledge
on to new employees), the more successful they tend to be (e.g., Miner et al., 2001).
One study on counterfactual thinking among entrepreneurs (Baron, 2000) compared
individuals who had started and were currently running their own business (entrepreneurs)
with other persons who had no interest in doing so and had, in fact, never started a business
(school teachers, government employees). The two groups were matched on a wide range of
socieocnomic variables (age, education, and income). Both were asked to indicate the
frequency with which they had engaged in counterfactual thinking following disappointing
outcomes and the effects of such thoughts on their affective states. Results were clear:
entrepreneurs reported engaging in counterfactual thinking significantly less frequently than
nonentrepreneurs. Moreover, they reported less negative affect as a result of such thought
(e.g., fewer regrets). In fact, when asked to list the three events in their lives they regretted
most, entrepreneurs often failed to identify three such events and reported a significantly
lower number than nonentrepreneurs. As several entrepreneurs who participated in the study
put it, they much prefer to focus on the future and view thinking about events that might have
occurred but did not as a waste of time (Baron, 2000).
Combining these findings with the reasoning noted above, it seems possible that although
entrepreneurs generally engage in counterfactual thinking less often than other persons,
successful ones may be more adept at using such thought to develop improved task strategies.
In other words, they may profit more from their past mistakes. This is an interesting
possibility and one that can readily be investigated in future research.
5.3. Processing style, susceptibility to cognitive errors
Many other aspects of cognition, too, may play a role in entrepreneurs’ success. For instance, cognitive scientists have recently drawn a clear distinction between two modes or styles
of thought: systematic processing, which involves careful, analytic thinking, and heuristic
processing, a contrasting style in which information is processed quickly and effortlessly, in
accordance with various simple heuristics (e.g., ‘‘If it comes from a good source, then I will
believe it; if not, I will reject it’’; Petty and Cacioppo, 1990). It seems reasonable to suggest
that entrepreneurs, as a group, show a preference for heuristic thinking: they are, after all,
action-oriented and strongly prefer making things happen to merely thinking about them (e.g.,

<-----Page 14----->R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

235

Amit et al., 2000). On the other hand, since entrepreneurs are, by definition, breaking new
ground in terms of the products or services their companies provide, they must also engage in
careful analysis of situations and events and formulate strategic plans. This reasoning suggests
that perhaps successful entrepreneurs are ones who can manage their own preference for
heuristic thinking and for ‘‘forging ahead,’’ at least to a degree. In other words, they can indeed
think carefully and strategically when the need arises. In contrast, less successful entrepreneurs
may not be as adept at making this change and may retain their preference for heuristic
thinking even in situations where more systematic thought could prove beneficial. In addition,
it is possible that successful entrepreneurs are more proficient than less successful ones at
formulating effective heuristics—mental aids for making fast but accurate decisions. Entrepreneurship researchers may well wish to investigate these predictions, derived from a
cognitive perspective.
Earlier, the potential impact of cognitive biases in the decision to become an entrepreneur
was discussed. It was suggested that susceptibility to several such biases (e.g., overconfidence, the planning fallacy) might encourage individuals to ‘‘take the plunge’’ and
start new ventures. Susceptibility to such biases may also play a role in shaping
entrepreneurs’ success. Specifically, it seems possible that successful entrepreneurs, as
compared to unsuccessful ones, may be less subject to a wide range of cognitive errors
or biases that can serve to distort information processing and lead to less-than-optimal
decisions (e.g., Baron, 1998; Busenitz and Barney, 1997; Simon et al., 2000). Included
among such errors might be several discussed previously (e.g., the optimistic bias, Shepperd
et al., 1996; the planning fallacy, and the affect infusion, Forgas, 1995). These may prove
especially deadly to new ventures, which generally lack the resources of more mature
organizations.
One additional cognitive ‘‘tilt’’ that may be especially relevant to entrepreneurs’ success is
known as sunk costs—the tendency to stick with decisions that generate initial negative
outcomes (e.g., Ross and Staw, 1993). To the extent entrepreneurs fall prey to this cognitive
bias, they may put the survival of their new ventures in jeopardy. On the other hand, new
ventures rarely generate positive results immediately; thus, the tendency to ‘‘stay the course’’
in the face of initial, negative results may be an essential ingredient in attaining ultimate
success. These considerations lead to the intriguing possibility that successful entrepreneurs
may be the ones who are adept at knowing when to persevere—and when to switch to
alternative strategies (e.g., Baron and Markman, 2003).
Additional insights into the potential role of sunk costs in entrepreneurs’ success are
provided by Brockner et al. (2003), who relate this cognitive error to regulatory focus
theory. These authors note that whether a promotion focus or a prevention focus is more
effective from the point of view of helping entrepreneurs avoid the dangers of sunk costs
depends strongly on how the entrepreneurs interpret initial, negative results. If these are seen
as stemming from the better options that are currently available, then persons with a
promotion focus will be able to ‘‘cut loose’’ from failing decisions more readily than those
with a prevention focus. Why? Because they are primarily concerned with attaining positive
results, and the best way to do so is to switch to the new, better, and available course of
action.

<-----Page 15----->236

R.A. Baron / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 221–239

In contrast, if the superior option is not available, persons with a prevention focus may
have an edge—they may find it easier to extricate themselves from the trap of sunk costs.
Persons who adopt a prevention focus are primarily concerned with minimizing losses, so
they may quickly give up on the failing course of action they are now pursuing even though
a better one is not currently available to them. Research findings provide clear support for
both predictions. In an ingenious simulation study, Higgins et al. (2001) asked participants
to imagine that they had purchased tickets for two weekend trips: one ticket cost US$100,
the other US$50. However, participants were also told to assume that they would enjoy the
second (US$50 cost) trip more than the first (US$100 cost). Next, they were informed that
by error, both trips were scheduled for the same weekend and were then asked to choose
which ticket they would use. Note that in this situation, a superior alternative (the US$50
trip) is available: it costs less but will actually be enjoyed more. The sunk cost error is to go
on the trip that cost US$100 even though it will be enjoyed less. Consistent with the
researchers’ predictions, results indicated that persons with a promotion focus were less
likely to make this error than persons with a prevention focus; they found it easier to switch
to a better choice.
In a follow-up study, participants were told to imagine that they were the president of a
company engaged in the development of an airplane that would be undetectable by radar.
The company has budgeted US$10 million for the project, but now, after 90% of this budget
has been expended, it becomes clear that a competitor has already produced a better
airplane. For this situation, there is no superior alternative available; the sunk cost error is to
continue with development of the plane and spend the remaining US$1 million even though
a competitor has developed a better product. In this situation, it would be expected that
persons in a prevention focus would be more willing than persons in a promotion focus to
abandon the project, even though US$9 million had already been spent. This is precisely
what was found. Together, results of the two studies suggest that either a promotion or a
prevention focus can be useful from the point of avoiding the pitfalls of sunk costs, but that
which is more effective depends on the availability of superior alternatives or courses of
action.
In sum, it appears that several cognitive factors and processes, ranging from perceptions of
risk and counterfactual thinking on the one hand, through preferred processing style and
susceptibility to various cognitive biases on the other, may all play a role in entrepreneurs’
success. By including these variables within its scope, the field of entrepreneurship may gain
important insights into this central aspect of the entrepreneurial process.

6. Benefits of a cognitive perspective: some concluding thoughts
The major conclusion of this paper can be stated quite succinctly: a cognitive perspective
can prove extremely valuable to the field of entrepreneurship in its efforts to address several
basic issues. As shown in Table 2, a wide range of cognitive factors and processes may prove
helpful in this respect. Overall, then, including this perspective in the field’s overall ‘‘tool kit’’
appears to offer the potential for significant benefits.

(e.g., Optimistic bias, affect

Reduced susceptibility to certain

In concluding, it is important to note, once again, that a cognitive perspective should be
viewed as complementary to, rather than incompatible with, other points of view in
entrepreneurship—perspectives deriving from economics, strategy, or sociology. Many
factors other than cognitive ones influence entrepreneurs’ actions and decisions and these,
too, must be carefully considered. All that is being suggested here is that the cognitive
perspective may provide additional insights into the complex process of entrepreneurship
over and above those offered by these other points of view. Given the impressive success of a
cognitive approach in other fields (e.g., psychology, education), there are grounds for
predicting that it may also yield positive results when applied to the field of entrepreneurship.
Moreover, it seems possible that such benefits may accrue both to researchers wishing to
obtain definitive answers to entrepreneurship’s basic ‘‘why’’ questions, and to practitioners
attempting to assist entrepreneurs toward their goal of creating successful new ventures. Any
perspective that offers the promise of both scientific progress and practical interventions
would seem worthy of very careful attention indeed.
