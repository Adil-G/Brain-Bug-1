Incentives for Faculty Entrepreneurship

ABSTRACT. Entrepreneurial
behavior
by
professors—including decisions about collaboration with industry,
patenting and spinning oﬀ companies—can aﬀect the productivity of top universities’ technology transfer eﬀorts. Interviews
with 98 professors at 12 southeastern universities showed that
the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on these aspects of entrepreneurial behavior is the beliefs of professors about the proper
role of universities in the dissemination of knowledge. Some
institutional policies, notably revenue splits with inventors, can
aﬀect aspects of this behavior. These ﬁndings suggest that both
university incentive policies and ethical concerns about academic capitalism, by limiting the productivity of technology
transfer eﬀorts, have an eﬀect on regional economic development.

1. Introduction
Faculty researchers are making key decisions that
aﬀect the outcome of the technology transfer
process and thereby have an impact on regional
economic development. These decisions include:
(1) what industrial collaboration to seek; (2)
whether or not to disclose their discoveries and
whether or not to patent them; and (3) whether or
not to spin oﬀ a company. If we could better
understand what inﬂuences these decisions, we
would expect that technology transfer productivity
could be improved which would, in turn, increase
the universities’ regional economic impact.
Past research has focused on the economic and
institutional inﬂuences on university behavior,
particularly with regard to spillovers. This economics-based research literature has looked at the
role of the university in local and regional economic development. Rational choice institutional

approaches have been used to describe the changes
in universities since the enactment of the BayhDole Act in 1980 which accelerated the technology
transfer transformation of universities.
This paper expands the academic literature by
considering the behavioral characteristics of the
individual professor. Understanding the motivations of the professors who are performing the
research and making decisions about whether or
not to protect the resulting intellectual property
could give policymakers additional information
that could be useful for designing interventions
that will increase the productivity of the technology transfer process and hence the resulting
economic development.
Universities contribute to regional economic
development in many ways. Goldstein and Luger
(1997) characterize the university as a multiproduct entity that eﬀects regional economic
development in eight ways. Most relevant in the
context of this paper is that new knowledge is
explicitly transferred to industry through the formal technology transfer process; some knowledge
is applied to the creation of new products and
processes and some to the improvement of existing
products and processes.
The research university has changed dramatically during the past 20 years with regard to its
attitudes about technology transfer (Feller,
1997b). Four events in 1980 precipitated this
change, often referred to as the second transformation of the university (Etzkowitz, 1983). These
events were the decline in Federal funding to universities, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the emergence of biotechnology, and the Supreme Court
decision in Diamond v.Chakrabarty.
Federal funding for university research declined
in 1980 to only two-thirds of academic R&D
funding, down from a high of 73% in the
mid-1960s. By 1997, that share had dropped to

59% and has remained between 59 and 60% ever
since (National Science Board, 2000).
Observers have argued that this decline in
funding caused universities to turn toward industrial funding sources and that the increased
dependence on private sector resources caused the
universities to change to be more like the private
sector (Hackett, 1990). This resource dependence
explanation, however, fails to take into account
the fact that many universities had previously gone
through periods of varying dependence upon
industry funding for R&D (Lowen, 1991; Mowery
and Rosenberg, 1998).
Bayh-Dole was enacted to ‘‘promote the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported
research ... [and] to support the commercialization
and public availability of inventions’’ [35 U.S.C.
200]. The Act created, among other things, a uniform patent policy for federal agencies and enabled
small businesses and universities to retain title to
inventions made through federally-funded research.
The eﬀects of the Bayh-Dole Act on university
patenting activity have been widely documented.
The number of patents granted to universities has
risen sharply (Henderson et al., 1998) and the
number of universities patenting rose with an
attendant learning eﬀect as new entrants became
more proﬁcient at patenting higher-quality inventions (Mowery et al., 2002).
Genentech, the ﬁrst biotechnology company and
a spin-oﬀ from Stanford University and the University of California at San Francisco, went public
in 1980. Based on two technologies, recombinant
DNA (Dueker, 1997) and monoclonal antibodies
(U.S. Congress, 1984), biotechnology knowledge is
basically process technology, a new way of making
certain substances or producing certain antibodies
in quantity. To transfer this knowledge, which is
not easily written down, requires collaboration in
the laboratory between the inventor and the learner, usually industry (Pisano et al., 1988). This
reliance on collaboration in biotechnology is
shown by the relationships between university
researchers and new biotechnology ﬁrms. Spin-oﬀ
companies are the norm for the industry (Kenney,
1986; Zucker et al., 1998a, b, 1999, 2001).
A ﬁnal change in the environment that occurred
in 1980 supported the selection of entrepreneurial
faculty in biotechnology. This was the 1980
Supreme Court decision Diamond v. Chakrabarty

(447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ (BNA) 193 (1980)). The
Court decided that a live, human-made microorganism was patentable. This decision allowed
patenting of the results of recombinant DNA and
monoclonal antibody processes central to biotechnology and supported the surge in biotech
patenting and spin-oﬀ activity. As a result of these
four events of 1980, most research universities now
have a formal technology transfer process that
facilitates the transfer of new inventions to
industry (Liebeskind, 2001). Research carried out
at universities can lead to discoveries, some of
which are disclosed to the host institution. Some
disclosures receive intellectual property protection,
usually patents, but copyright and plant rights are
also appropriate in some cases. Intellectual property can then be licensed. Some licenses are to
existing companies; a few are to start-up companies. Some start-up companies involve the faculty
researcher who made the discovery. These start-up
companies, or spin-oﬀs, are highly prized by local
economic developers because they tend to stay in
the same state.
Faculty members are making decisions about
how to disseminate the results of their research in
this institutional milieu. They are deciding whether
or not to collaborate with industry, whether or not
to disclosure their inventions to their university,
and whether or not to start a company based on
their new knowledge. These choices are entrepreneurial in nature as they reﬂect an individual’s
recognition of an opportunity to commercialize an
innovation. However, strictly speaking, while
spinning oﬀ a company is clearly an entrepreneurial activity, patenting and collaborating may
be considered entrepreneurial only if they are done
in contemplation of starting a company (Gartner,
1988; Reynolds, 1994).
These decisions directly aﬀect the productivity of
the university’s technology transfer program, a
measure of outcomes per unit of input, since the
quantity of outputs in the form of patents, licenses
and spin oﬀs is directly related to the quantity of
inputs, that is how many disclosures are made.
Jensen, Thursby and Thursby note that ‘‘many
technology transfer oﬃce directors believe that
substantially less than half of the inventions with
commercial potential are disclosed to their oﬃce’’
(2003, p. 1272). Therefore, understanding how
faculty make these decisions is critical. The purpose

<-----Page 2----->Academic Capitalism and University Incentives

of this paper is to present ﬁndings about how faculty
balance their ethical concerns, the norms of their
discipline and their university, and their experiences
as academic professionals when deciding whether or
not to disclose new inventions, pursue patenting
opportunities or spin-oﬀ a company.

2. Inﬂuences on faculty entrepreneurial decisions
There are three possible institutional inﬂuences on
university researchers that could explain their
decisions to patent and/or start companies.
Researchers make choices within the context of
constraints imposed by the university. Some constraints are policy-based incentives; others are
based in the researcher’s discipline. Less understood, however, are the constraints imposed by the
norms of the university—the explicit and implicit
rules of expected behavior. Further, constraints
are also imposed by the individual’s capabilities
and the ‘‘publish or perish’’ paradigm.
The ﬁrst possibility is that the individual’s own
beliefs and capabilities may be an inﬂuence on the
choices that he/she makes, responding to the costs
and beneﬁts represented by norms, routines and
myths within the university setting. Given that
gaining outside funding for research is a ﬁscal
reality for today’s faculty members, a researcher
who believes in the importance of commercialization might pursue industrial collaborations and
funding for his/her work, seeking support for research that is more applied and likely to be patentable. A researcher who does not believe that
universities should be involved with commercialization might choose research topics that are very
basic and seek only federal funding.
The traditional academic ethos was described by
Merton (1973) as having four elements:
disinterestedness, universalism, organized skepticism and communism of intellectual property.
Under this paradigm, competence, as measured by
peers, is the only acceptable measure for career
advancement. Findings from research are a product of social collaboration and are assignedto the
community. Recognition and esteem emerge only
from full and open communication of ﬁndings.
This so-called Mertonian ethos is in stark contrast to the emerging ethos of academic capitalism
(Slaughter et al., 1997). Rather than publishing all

229

results, academic capitalism emphasizes intellectual property rights and the public good attained
through the commercialization of results. This
ethos is supported by spirit of the Bayh-Dole Act
and the intellectual property policies in place at
most research universities.
Owen-Smith and Powell (2001a) have documented a multi-dimensional array of faculty attitudes toward academic capitalism. Others
(Etzkowitz et al., 1998) have also suggested that
faculty attitudes vary considerably across these
dimensions. Faculty express concerns about the
loss of traditional values, especially openness.
According to some, patenting has changed collegial relationships. Trust-based exchanges are now
contract-based. Further, patents, based on science
not validated by other academics, are becoming
part of the equation that measures prestige,
and therefore career advancement and funding
(Liebeskind, 2001).
A second competing proposition is an evolutionary model of the transformation of the university over the last 20 years. This model projects a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the transformation of different disciplines or technology areas, particularly
among life science researchers and other scientists
and engineers. It assumes that life sciences inventions are more tacit in nature, leading to more
spin-oﬀs, because the professor would need to be
continually involved to successfully commercialize
the invention. This model also predicts a cohort
eﬀect, that younger faculty will be more entrepreneurial.
A third inﬂuence could be the institutional
policies and procedures of the particular university
where a researcher works. This, along with the
second inﬂuence, represent the tug-of-war between
the discipline and department/university described
by Alpert (1985), Clark (1987) and Geiger (1986).
Departmental norms could support traditional
activities while university-wide policies and economic incentives may encourage more entrepreneurial activity.
The extant literature that focuses on the patenting decisions of faculty members does not
control for attitudes about academic capitalism,
academic quality, discipline or age, and instead
focuses on the university’s technology transfer
policies and procedures. This forms a substantial
basis for hypothesizing that institutional economic

<-----Page 3----->230

Renault

incentives may be important to understanding the
level of entrepreneurship.
Jensen et al. (2003) present a game theoretic
model of the interaction between the three major
actors in university technology transfer: faculty,
the technology transfer oﬃce and central administration. Based on a survey of 62 research universities, the authors conclude that faculty
willingness to disclose is related to the stage of the
innovation. They also ﬁnd diﬀerences in disclosure
rates related to academic quality. More importantly, this work emphasizes the dual agent role of
the technology transfer oﬃce.
Feldman et al. (2001) have undertaken a study
of the interaction between faculty patenting
behavior and the organization of the technology
transfer oﬃce. They believe that the history, culture and norms of the university play an important
role in the university’s approach to technology
transfer. Their study is limited to three universities.
Owen-Smith and Powell (2001b) have interviewed 80 researchers in life sciences at two universities. They argue that faculty patenting
decisions are shaped by their perceptions of the
value of patent protection and the perceived costs
of interacting with technology transfer oﬃces and
licensing professionals.
A fourth study, by Siegel et al. (2003), involved
interviews with 98 entrepreneurs, and scientists and
administrators at ﬁve universities. They concluded
that organizational factors such as faculty reward
systems and technology transfer oﬃce staﬃng/
compensation practices inﬂuence the productivity
of the technology transfer activities (and, by implication, the choices made by faculty researchers).
These four studies, while limited in scope, suggest that the institutional economic incentives offered by individual universities can aﬀect the
decisions made by faculty entrepreneurs about
whether or not to collaborate with industry, disclose and/or patent their discoveries and spin oﬀ
companies. However, since they do not compare
these potential inﬂuences with the inﬂuences of
individual beliefs, academic quality, the discipline
or age, we still need to test these variables together.
3. Propositions based on the literature
The ﬁrst proposition posed herein is that the
norms and informal rules of the institution provide

a context for the individual to make choices. The
most important norm is the professor’s beliefs
about academic capitalism and the proper role of
the university in the commercialization of inventions that emerge from university research. These
beliefs constrain the entire decision-making process that a professor uses when evaluating research
topics, assessing diﬀerent funding sources and
deciding how to publicize his/her results. I expected that the individual faculty member’s attitude toward academic capitalism would be highly
correlated with their behavior. Further, I expected
that these beliefs would be deeply held and would
not have ﬂuctuated over a faculty member’s
career.
Academic quality is a second individual characteristic linked to technology transfer outcomes.
The best researchers are also the most interested in
the commercialization of their results, in direct
contrast to those who claim that academic capitalism lowers academic standards in research. I
expected that measures of academic quality would
also be highly correlated with entrepreneurial
behavior.
The second proposition is that the transformation of the university has been an evolutionary
process resulting in diﬀerences by discipline and
age. Life sciences has been more supportive of
entrepreneurial behavior over the past 20 years
compared to engineering. In engineering, some
level of entrepreneurship has been evident for over
100 years at a fairly steady rate. Because of the
inﬂuence exerted by the tacit knowledge inherent
in biotechnology, I expected faculty in the life
sciences to be more entrepreneurial than those in
engineering.
The year of graduation for professors is also
critical in this explanation because four key events
happened in the 1980 timeframe, starting the
transformation. Therefore, faculty who were
trained after 1980 would be expected to be more
entrepreneurial than their older colleagues.
The third proposition is the one most often
cited in the literature. Here, institutional economic
incentives, speciﬁcally the policies of the university
and the technology transfer oﬃces, form the
environment for individual decision making.
Including these incentives in this analysis will enable us to compare their inﬂuence relative to the
competing propositions.

4. Research design and data collection
Four data sets were used in this study. Brieﬂy, a
Web survey was administered to 420 faculty; 59
professors (14.0%) responded. Second, I conducted face-to-face interviews with faculty, using
the same questions that were on the Web survey,
with 39 faculty, 32 in person and 7 by telephone.
These interviews were supplemented with meetings
with the chief technology transfer oﬃcer and the
Vice Provost for Research (or whomever was the
senior administration oﬃcial responsible for
research aﬀairs) at each of the 12 universities
represented by the 98 faculty. At three universities,
I met with a person aﬃliated with an incubator or
business development activity, usually at the request of the Vice Provost for Research. And
fourth, I collected secondary data about the universities from the Association of University
Technology Managers (AUTM) and the National
Science Foundation (NSF).
To elaborate on these data sets, I used a twostage sampling scheme for this study. First, I chose
12 southeastern1 universities from a population of
the U.S. universities categorized as Doctoral/Research Extensive by the Carnegie Foundation for
Higher Education.2 Within this sample of 12 universities, I randomly chose (with replacement) to
interview professors from 3 life sciences and 3
engineering departments. Each sampling stage is
described below.
A Doctoral/Research/Extensive university is
deﬁned as a U.S. degree-granting and accredited
university that grants 50 or more doctoral degrees
per year across at least 15 disciplines. According to
the Carnegie Foundation, in 2000 there were 130
Doctoral/Research Extensive universities nationally. I selected the 39 Doctoral/Research Extensive
universities in the southeastern states. Since both
students and faculty are recruited both nationally
and internationally, these southeastern universities
are representative of the entire population of 130.
To recognize the important distinctions in mission and funding sources, I further categorized
these 39 southeastern Doctoral/Extensive universities into public (non-land grant), land grant and
private. This categorization allowed me to compare faculty in universities with public funding to
those in universities with the added tradition of
public service (land grants). Further, I could

231

compare these both to faculty at privately funded
institutions.
I then chose the top four universities in each
category, using three measures: the Faculty Quality
Ratings in the 1995 National Research Council
report (National Research Council 1995) across all
life science and engineering departments; federallyﬁnanced R&D expenditures in FY2001; and the
ranking of U.S. research universities by the
Lombardi Program at the University of Florida3
(Lombardi et al. 2002). The 12 universities are:
Johns Hopkins, University of Virginia, Virginia
Tech, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Duke, North Carolina State, University of Georgia,
Georgia Tech, Emory, University of Florida, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt.
Within these 12 universities, the second-stage
sampling frame was all full-time science and
engineering faculty in the departments related to
biotechnology and information technology,
including full, associate, and assistant professors
and research faculty. The departments were: biochemistry, biomedical engineering, (cell) biology,
electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and
computer science
For each university, I used departmental websites to compile a master list of faculty in the life
science disciplines as deﬁned by the three departments listed above, and similarly for the engineering disciplines. To manage the fact that some
departments are much larger than others, I chose a
proportional number of faculty from life sciences
and engineering for each university. Since the
engineering faculty at the University of Georgia
was the smallest in the sample universe at only 19,
I randomly selected 19 professors in each discipline
at each school. This yielded 4374 names. In the
same way, I chose 6 additional names at each
university to interview in person, a total of 72
faculty, 3 in life sciences and 3 in engineering.
I then sent an email to the 437 professors with
an explanation of the importance of the survey
and requesting their cooperation. Some emailed
back and asked to have their names removed from
my list. A week later, I sent another email to the
remaining 420 professors that again explained the
project and contained a hyperlink to the survey. A
week later, I sent a reminder survey to all. At the
end of this process, I received 59 responses, a
14.0% response rate.

<-----Page 5----->232

Renault

Further, I interviewed 39 faculty members from
the list of 72 compiled at all 12 universities, 32
professors in person and 7 on the telephone, a
response rate of 54%.
5. Variables5
The unit of analysis is the individual faculty researcher in a science or engineering discipline at a
top-ranked southeastern university. There are
three dependent variables, each a categorical measure of a key aspect of entrepreneurial behavior.
The three variables are dichotomous metrics that,
taken together, represent a continuum of entrepreneurial actions by faculty. The three variables
correspond to responses to the following three
questions:
1. Does the professor collaborate with industry?
2. Has the researcher ever ﬁled or does he/she intend to ﬁle a patent on any discoveries resulting
from his/her existing or past research projects?
3. Has the researcher ever or does he/she plan to
spin oﬀ a company based on existing or past
research projects?
To test which of the ﬁve hypothesized inﬂuences
on the level of entrepreneurship is most important, I
collected data on a number of explanatory variables.
To test the importance of the context revealed
by individual beliefs and capacity, I directly measured an individual’s attitudes toward entrepreneurship by asking: On a ﬁve-point Likert scale,
how does the individual rate himself/herself between the Mertonian ideal of the free exchange of
ideas (1) and support for academic capitalism (5).
The researcher’s perception of institutional entrepreneurship is critical to assess how the individual
reacts to the institutional culture. I asked: On a
ﬁve-point Likert scale, how does the individual
rate the university between the Mertonian ideal of
the free exchange of ideas (1) and support for
academic capitalism (5)? I asked a similar question
about the individual’s department. This scale represents my hypothesis about the range of attitudes
prevalent in universities, and draws upon previous
studies by Owen-Smith and Powell (2001a, b).
Publication count is used to measure of the
excellence of the researcher, found to correlate
with most measures of academic quality (Cole and

Cole, 1973). Total external research funding for the
current academic year (2002–03) on which the
faculty member was named, another measure of the
quality of the researcher’s work, was also used.
Tenure is a categorical control variable measuring
whether or not the researcher holds a tenured
position, is non-tenured but tenure track, or holds
a non-tenured research appointment.
To test the evolutionary hypothesis, discipline
was coded from the faculty’s primary departmental appointment. The life sciences were coded together, as were engineering departments. An
additional individual variable important to the
evolutionary hypothesis is year of graduation for
the individual’s terminal degree (usually Ph.D. or
M.D.). This captures the inﬂuence of changes in
the university with regard to technology transfer,
without regard to age when receiving the degree.
In order to assess whether the sample is representative of the universe of faculty, I also collected
data on the age of each respondent.
Since the technology transfer oﬃce policies appear to inﬂuence technology transfer outcomes
(Bercovitz et al., 2001), I included a number of
measures of Technology Transfer Oﬃce (TTO)
policies and procedures that provide economic
incentives to faculty. Key policies are: percentage
of royalties that accrue to the inventor and his/
her laboratory, the percentage of disclosures initially submitted as provisional applications, and
the percentage of patents applied for without a
licensee.
Other variables that control for university policies are a set of dummy variables for the university itself, and a categorical variable for the type of
university: land-grant, public and private.

6. Empirical results
There are 98 faculty members in the sample—59
faculty who participated in the Web survey plus 39
faculty who participated in the interviews. Since
the statistical analysis shown in Table V does not
control for response bias, Table IV show the similarities between the sample and the population of
life sciences and engineering faculty at US research
universities. In Table I, the respondents are distributed by department and university type compared to the characteristics of the population of

Most of the professors indicated that their
attitude about academic capitalism had remained
constant throughout their career. Seventy-one
percent of the professors interviewed said that they
had held their beliefs since graduate school. Of the
29% who said that they had changed, 82.8% went
up on the academic capitalism scale, and 55%
went up by 2 or more.
Fifty-one percent of the sample collaborates
with industry, 50% had ever or planned to patent
and 15.3% either planned to or had spun oﬀ a
company. This compares well with Agrawal and
Henderson’s (2002) ﬁnding that one-half of MIT
professors had never patented.
I used a logistic regression model to examine the
relative signiﬁcance of the variables upon faculty
behavior, since the three dependent variables were
dichotomous. For these models, I assumed that
the variances are logistic and therefore used a logit
model. I recognized that the coeﬃcients cannot be
interpreted directly. Using logit, the odds ratio was
calculated by ex, where x is the coeﬃcient. This
gave a sweeping result as all other variables are
held equal.
Using this technique, logit functions comparing
the two values of each of the three dependent
dichotomous variables were estimated with each
hypothesis added one at a time. This resulted in a
series of nested models. For example, the model
testing both the discipline and year of graduation
hypotheses is in the form:

One respondent was not included due to missing data.

Then, for each dependent variable, I chose a
ﬁnal model that incorporated the most important
variables from all of the previous models. I chose
the model that both improved the overall ﬁt of
the model, measured by the Wald v2 statistic,
the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), and the
Cox and Snell R2, and maximized the signiﬁcance
of the explanatory variables measured by t-statistics.
The coeﬃcients from the ﬁnal model for each
dependent variable were expressed as ex so that I
could evaluate them using the odds ratio interpretation.
The two-stage sampling scheme requires attention to the possibility of cluster-correlated data.
The observations are not independent or identically distributed. Certain universities may be over
sampled and others under sampled. Observations

within each university are likely to be correlated.
These characteristics can lead to underestimated
standard errors for parameters of interest and test
statistics with inﬂated Type 1 error rates. To
manage these issues, I used a program designed to
take the cluster correlations into account when
estimating the parameters. In this case, the
parameters are estimated using a logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations
(GEE).
I found that for each increase of one point on
the academic capitalism scale, a professor is 61.1%
more likely to collaborate with industry, 63.4%
more likely to patent and 407.1% more likely to
spin oﬀ a company. These results are shown in
Table V.

the individual professor, is also signiﬁcant. An
increase in publications yields a 5.8% increase in
patenting. In addition, professors are 7.5% more
likely to patent and 16.9% more likely to spin oﬀ
for each percentage point increase in the revenue
split they will receive.
I completed a content analysis of the transcripts
of the interviews with faculty members as well as
the comments sections from the Web survey. Sixty-nine faculty had 122 comments on patenting
which I coded into 26 diﬀerent reasons. I then
collapsed the initial 26 types of comments into 5
reasons for patenting and 5 reasons for not patenting. I used these comments to look for patterns
to explain the diﬀerences noted in the logistic
regressions.
An individual’s attitude toward academic capitalism is a strong predictor of his/her likelihood of
collaborating with industry, having ever patented
and having ever spun oﬀ a company. The reasons
for patenting are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from expected (p<0.05, degrees of freedom=16); the
reasons against patenting are not signiﬁcant. These
ﬁndings are illustrated in Figure 1.
The higher an individual’s academic capitalism
rating, the more likely that person is to patent
because of the market opportunities. Fifty-eight
percent of ‘‘4’’s and 50% of ‘‘5’’s cite getting to

market as the reason to patent. They made comments such as:
‘‘The bigger picture is that technology transfer from
academic to industry isn’t a trivial thing. There’s a lot
of stuﬀ that gets published and it’s hard for companies to separate the wheat from the chaﬀ, to ﬁgure
out where the nuggets of ideas are that will beneﬁt
the commercial marketplace. There needs to be a lot
of interactive exchange across that boundary to make
that happen.’’
Engineering professor, private university, 40 years old
‘‘Scientists don’t make or discover medicines. To
make a drug or a medicine takes a company.’’
Life sciences professor, public university, 52 years old

On the other hand, those with low ratings who
patented did so because of the challenge (50%).
One said:
‘‘A new challenge, a new world, a diﬀerent arena. Once
you are a tenured professor at a place like this, it’s
pretty clear what’s going to happen down the road.’’
Life sciences professor, public university, 52 years old

Those with middle to low academic capitalism
ratings, ‘‘2’’s and ‘‘3’’s, cited duty and responsibility and colleagues and sponsors a total of 66%
and 56%, respectively.

Figure 1. Reasons for patenting or not by attitudes about academic capitalism.

‘‘Patenting was not anything I ever thought about
doing. In both cases, it was pressure from other
people who thought there were really good ideas that
should go out ... a collaborator from industry and
other people in this department.’’
Life sciences professor, land-grant university, 39 years
old

Those who rated themselves as ‘‘1’’s and ‘‘2’’s said
that patenting was inappropriate for academia 28
and 25% respectively.
‘‘The essence of industry involvement is to keep it
secret. That’s the core of competitiveness. The essence of university work is to make it public, or at
least you can argue that. There’s tension there,
without a doubt.’’
Life sciences professor, private university, 61 years old

Those with high self-ratings, ‘‘4’’s and ‘‘5’’s, who
did not patent, most often cited not knowing if
their technology was patentable (50% of ‘‘5’’s),
research that was too theoretical or basic (50% of
‘‘5’’s) or patenting being too time consuming
(100% of ‘‘4’’s).
In addition to beliefs and attitudes about patenting, the faculty respondents also shared a
number of ideas about the university milieu. Three
stood out. First is the recognition that universities
are in a ﬁnancial crunch and revenue is critical.
Second is the impact of conﬂict of interest and
conﬂict of commitment policies on entrepreneurship. These policies were seen as depressing the
entrepreneurial spirit. Third was the importance of
tenure and promotion to a professor’s career and
the role of the department in those decisions.
Tenure and promotion policies generally do not

<-----Page 10----->Academic Capitalism and University Incentives

recognize patents and spin-oﬀs as valuable academic achievements, especially when compared to
publications.
An important observation, however, was that
whatever the university policies may be, the
important decisions in an academic’s career, tenure and promotion, are made at the department
level. Therefore, if the department is lukewarm
about technology transfer, this will aﬀect the
behaviors of the professors. Note that most
respondents reported that their department had
the same academic capitalism rating as they
did—the mean of the diﬀerence between one’s
rating and one’s department’s rating was 0.2
where 0.0 means that the department and individual have the same rating. In contrast, only 37%
thought that the university had the same rating as
they did. The mean of the diﬀerence was 0.6, and
the range was wider. Most believed that the university had a higher academic capitalism rating
than they did.

7. Conclusions and policy observations
Professors in the sample have a range of beliefs in
academic capitalism and these beliefs are linked
with their behavior. The newer norm of academic
capitalism is not universally embraced. In fact,
those with the most extreme views, both for and
against academic capitalism are found in all type
of universities, in all six of the departments, in all
age groups, and among all levels of academic
quality. Given that the universities themselves are
publicly embracing academic capitalism, and that
faculty are required to disclose their inventions,
the strength of the traditional norms is notable.
This is especially true because the types of
departments in this sample are those most likely to
have research with practical applications.
The ﬁndings show that an individual’s personal
beliefs about the appropriate role of universities in
commercializing technology are the single most
important predictor of their actual behavior.
Academic quality, as measured by publications,
was also a critical factor in technology transfer
participation.
The importance of technology transfer policies
as one inﬂuence on professors’ decisions about
patenting and spinning oﬀ companies was revealed

237

in the logistic regression analysis. The revenue split
was a strong positive inﬂuence. Similarly, spinning
oﬀ was most strongly inﬂuenced by the revenue
split.
Conﬂict of interest and conﬂict of commitment
policies may be reducing the number of spin-oﬀ
companies. Fifteen percent of the sample said that
they had spun oﬀ a company; another 8% had
considered the idea and dropped it. Several professors who had spun oﬀ companies expressed the
opinion that the conﬂict of interest and conﬂict of
commitment policies were hostile to entrepreneurship and had a chilling eﬀect. A review of the
policies showed that many activities that would
allow a spin-oﬀ company to beneﬁt from the
relationship with the university, the underpinning
of spillover theory, are now often prohibited, while
only a few years ago these activities were permitted
with disclosure.
Based on this research, it would appear that the
second transformation of the US research university, adding economic development to the established missions of teaching and research, is still a
work in progress. While most major universities
have added technology transfer oﬃces, incubators,
research parks and other institutions dedicated to
the commercialization of university technology, it
is apparent that some conﬂicts remain among
these missions.
Further, university policies reinforce the perceived contradictions among the missions. Although the disclosure of inventions is required,
and revenues arising from the successful patenting
and licensing of the resulting intellectual property
are split with the inventors, these policies are
overshadowed by other, more fundamental
incentives.
Tenure and promotion policies widely support
publishing and research activities; patenting and
spinning oﬀ companies are, at best, tolerated.
Conﬂict of interest and conﬂict of commitment
policies tightly control all potential actions that a
faculty member with a start-up company might
take, limiting the very collaborations between the
company and the university that constitute the
company’s competitive advantage and the university’s role in economic development.
University policymakers need to address the
conﬂicting incentives on their campuses and continue the discussion of the underlying issues of the

<-----Page 11----->238

Renault

debate over academic capitalism. As long as the
intellectual property, conﬂict of interest and tenure
and promotion policies are not providing a consistent message for faculty about what is appropriate and desired behavior, the variety of actions
shown in this study will continue.
Until patents and spin-oﬀ companies are recognized as evidence of scholarly contributions, and
used and not just tolerated in the tenure and
promotions processes, the willingness of the faculty to spend their time on such activities will be
considerably reduced.
The conﬂict of interest and conﬂict of commitment policies pose a diﬃcult problem. On one
hand, it is important to manage the inevitable
conﬂicts that arise, particularly from spin-oﬀ
activities. On the other hand, it is also important
not to create an environment of distrust and suspicion where all entrepreneurs are considered
guilty until proven otherwise.
Above all, the implication for policy and practice is to remember that not all members of the
university community support the ends of regional
economic development and fewer still support the
means. To maximize the spillovers from a university to the local and regional economies requires
interventions at the beginning of the process to
ensure that faculty understand the process, support the process and have the appropriate incentives to participate in the process. This needs to be
done with sensitivity to the long standing academic
ethics and the conﬂicts within the missions of the
research university.
