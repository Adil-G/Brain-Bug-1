Perspective: Ranking of the World’s Top Innovation
Management Scholars and Universities*
Pianpian Yang and Lei Tao

This paper extends Jeffrey Thieme’s article “The World’s Top Innovation Management Scholars and Their Social
Capital,” published in 2007 in JPIM, in which he made a ranking of the world’s top innovation managements scholars.
This paper makes four contributions. First, this paper includes data on innovation management from articles published
in two leading innovation management journals and eight top management and marketing journals during past 20
years (1991–2010). Second, this paper classifies 1229 articles into 29 categories, revealing hot topics and future
research directions. Third, this paper ranks 1718 innovation management scholars over a period of 20 years from 1991
to 2010. Fourth, this is the first time that 625 universities have been ranked in terms of their current faculty research
capabilities in the field of innovation management.
The empirical data from the past 20 years show that the world’s top 10 innovation management scholars are:
Michael Song (University of Missouri-Kansas City), Roger J. Calantone (Michigan State University), Erik Jan Hultink
(Delft University of Technology), Mark E. Parry (University of Missouri-Kansas City), Kwaku Atuahene-Gima (China
Europe International Business School), C. Anthony Di Benedetto (Temple University), Abbie Griffin (University of
Utah), William E. Souder (Retired), Barry L. Bayus (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), and Christoph H.
Loch (INSEAD).
The world’s top 10 innovation management universities are: University of Missouri-Kansas City, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Michigan State University, INSEAD, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Northeastern University, Texas A&M University, Stanford University, and Delft University of Technology.

Introduction

I

nnovation is “the overall process whereby an invention is transformed into a commercial product that
can be sold profitably” (Crawford and Di Benedetto,
2006). As a burgeoning area of fierce competition among
firms, studying innovation yields critical economic
insights (Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Guo, 2008). Managing innovation is integral in changing innovative ideas to
performance. Reviews by Chen, Damanpour, and Reilly
(2010), Karniouchina, Victorino, and Verma (2006), and
Page and Schirr (2008) have confirmed substantial
growth in the field of innovation management during the
last two decades.
As the body of innovation management literature
develops and expands, it is useful to list top contributors
and universities. A research productivity ranking of individual scholars is useful for identifying top scholars in the
field, while a productivity ranking of universities pro-

vides important information for prospective faculty
recruits, doctoral students, companies seeking consulting
help, potential donors, and other stakeholders. Articles
published in top academic journals are one of the most
important measures for high-quality intellectual research
(Bakir, Vitell, and Rose, 2000; Chan, Fung, and Leung,
2006; Ford, LaTour, and Henthorne, 2001; Linton, 2004;
Thieme, 2007). Therefore, this paper identifies and ranks
the most productive scholars and universities by computing the number of articles from two leading academic
innovation management journals and eight top management and marketing journals.
This paper also investigates general topics that have
been studied and identify the most popular research
topics in the field of innovation management. A comprehensive database of articles related to innovation management between 1991 and 2010 is developed. Further, these
articles are classified into 29 specific categories, and the
experts are identified in each subfield. By collecting and
analyzing 1229 publications, which reflect the work of
1718 scholars in 10 top journals from the past 20 years,
this paper makes the following three ranking lists: (1) top
scholars based on total number of articles published in
top 10 journals over last 20 years; (2) top scholars based

<-----Page 1----->320

on total number of articles published in eight traditional
top management and marketing journals that publish significant innovation management articles over the last 20
years; and (3) the world’s top innovation management
universities in terms of their current faculty research
capabilities.

Ranking Method
The ranking of scholars and universities is made on the
basis of peer-reviewed research journals. Although
books, conference proceedings, and working papers are
also evidence of scholarship, peer-reviewed journals
remain the focus of the academic community (Linton,
2004; Thieme, 2007). Based on citation impact factor,
past studies have established that JPIM and IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management are the top two
innovation management journals (Cheng, Kumar,
Motwani, Reisman, and Madan, 1999; Linton and Thongpapanl, 2004; Thieme, 2007). Since innovation management cuts across disciplines (Thieme, 2007), this paper
also includes five top management journals (Strategic
Management Journal, Management Science, Administrative Science Quarterly, Academy of Management Review,
and Academy of Management Journal; see ranking by
Linton and Thongpapanl, 2004), one top journal in operations management (Journal of Operations Management;
see ranking by Barman, Hanna, and Laforge, 2001), and
two top marketing journals (Journal of Marketing and
Journal of Marketing Research; see ranking by Baumgartner and Pieters, 2003). This paper considers the same
top management and marketing journals as Thieme
(2007), but in contrast to Thieme’s work, our research
includes only two top innovation management journals
and adds one top operations management journal for its
growing attention in the innovation management field.
This research collected electronic copies of all articles
published in these 10 top journals between 1991 and
2010, using Business Source Premier and the WileyBlackwell Full Collection. Following Thieme’s (2007)
data collection procedure, an article was retained imme-

diately if it was clear from the title that the article’s
conclusions had direct implications on innovation management. In many cases, when this was not necessarily
clear from the title, two authors read the abstract. An
article was retained only if the abstract reading clarified
that the article had direct implications for innovation
management (Crawford and Di Benedetto, 2006).
Our focus is original contribution to innovation management research. Therefore, this paper excluded the following types of articles: literature review, meta-analysis,
ranking article, research note and practitioner note, book
review, comment, reply, dialogue and rejoinder, spotlight
article, editorial (from the editors), and announcements.
In addition, this research excluded articles whose primary
focus is technology forecasting, technology transfer and
diffusion, cross-functional team management (unless the
study is specifically related to innovation management
teams), organizational innovation (i.e., new forms of
organizing a firm’s management structure), organizational innovative technology adoption, process innovation, product line innovation, new business creation and
entrepreneurship, and individual creativity.
Using these criteria, 1293 possible innovation management articles were collected. The journal’s name,
article title, publication year, author’s name, author’s
affiliation at the time of publication, abstract, and key
words (if applicable) were noted. Among these 1293
articles, the two authors independently judged 1175 of
them to be innovation management research, disagreeing
on only 118 articles. To resolve this, both authors read the
articles in their entirety and were able to agree that 39 of
the disputed articles are in fact innovation management
research. For the remaining 79 articles where no consensus was reached, two well-known and respected professors in innovation management were requested to classify
these articles independently. Fifteen more articles were
judged to be innovation management research. Therefore,
a total of 1229 innovation management articles are
included in our ranking analysis.
Our results indicate that in the 20-year period (1991–
2010), JPIM and IEEE Transactions on Engineering
Management published the most innovation management
articles (555 and 138, respectively). Among top eight
management and marketing journals, Management
Science is found to publish the most innovation management articles (140), followed by Academy of Management Journal (82), Journal of Marketing (77), Journal of
Marketing Research (76), Strategic Management Journal
(58), Journal of Operations Management (50), Academy
of Management Review (29), and Administrative Science
Quarterly (24).

<-----Page 2----->RANKING OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT SCHOLARS

Classification
This paper classified the innovation management research
topics into 29 categories (i.e., subfields) based on three
review articles (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995; Henard and
Szymanski, 2001; Montoya-Weiss and Calantone, 1994).
The results are presented in Table 1. The categories in
Table 1 are not necessarily mutually exclusive (one article
may be classified into multiple categories).
One of the most noticeable aspects of Table 1 is the
uneven distribution of articles among the subfields of
innovation management research. Over the 20-year
period, the areas that have received the most publishing
attention are: company resources, structural approach,
and external/internal relations, followed by organizational attributes, environment, strategy, launch proficiency, product innovation, fit with market need/meet
customer needs, and speed to market. However, few
articles have examined product price and product technological sophistication.
Results from Table 1 demonstrate that Michael Song
published at least two articles in 21 out of the 29 categories, thereby making him the most prolific contributor in
more than two thirds of the innovation management subfields. Michael Song is followed by Mark E. Parry, Erik
Jan Hultink, William E. Souder, Kwaku Atuahene-Gima,
Roger J. Calantone, Barry L. Bayus, Ulrike de Brentani,
Abbie Griffin, C. Anthony Di Benedetto, and Morgan L.
Swink—all of who published at least two articles in more
than three categories. In addition, 16 scholars are shown
as experts relating to two categories (see Table 1).

World’s Top Innovation
Management Scholars
To rank the innovation management scholars, this paper
adopted the methods used in prior ranking studies (e.g.,
Heck and Cooley, 1988; Inkpen and Beamish, 1994; Lu,
2003; Morrison and Inkpen, 1991; Thieme, 2007) to construct unadjusted and adjusted count measures of authors.
The first method gives full credit to each author of an
article, while the second method weights the authors (one
divided by the number of authors in the article). No
weighting distinction was made between senior authors
and their co-authors (see Table 2 “Number of Articles
Adjusted”). The same method was used in previous
studies by Stahl, Leap, and Wei (1988), Thieme (2007),
and Young, Baird, and Pullman (1996). Because each of
these two ranking methods inherently includes some bias,
this paper uses both ranking methods, and the results are
reported in Table 2.

Table 2 presents top 50 innovation management scholars who have each published at least five articles in the 10
top journals between 1991 and 2010. The list of top
scholars expands to 182 if scholars who published at least
three articles are included. This paper also presents the
top innovation management scholars whose adjusted
number of articles is more than 2.25. A longer list of top
innovation management scholars and a supplementary
list of most active innovation management scholars from
2006 to 2010 are available in the following website:
http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/web/leitao.
Consistent with the ranking by Thieme (2007), the
empirical results show that Michael Song leads the
ranking again and he claims that title of “world’s number
one innovation scholar.” The other top 10 innovation
management scholars are Roger J. Calantone, Erik Jan
Hultink, Mark E. Parry, Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, C.
Anthony Di Benedetto, Abbie Griffin, William E. Souder,
Barry L. Bayus, and Christoph H. Loch.
Because innovation management has also gained
increasing attention in top management and marketing
journals, this paper also ranks innovation management
scholars who publish in other traditional A + marketing
and management journals. Table 3 displays the top innovation management scholars in eight top management and
marketing journals (excluding JPIM and IEEE) over 20
years. The 12 top innovation management scholars in top
management and marketing journals are Michael Song,
Barry L. Bayus, Rajesh K. Chandy, Kwaku AtuaheneGima, Michael A. Hitt, Christian Terwiesch, Christine
Moorman, Christoph H. Loch, Donald R. Lehmann, Eric
von Hippel, Jinhong Xie, and Steven D. Eppinger. Each of
these top 12 scholars has published at least six innovation
management articles in the eight top management and
marketing journals between 1991 and 2010.

World’s Top Innovation
Management Universities
There are different methodologies for ranking universities (Chapple, Powers, and Bunch, 2003; Linton, 2004).
Traditionally, university rankings are based on aggregation of faculty publishing articles (Bakir et al., 2000;
Chan et al., 2006; Ford et al., 2001; Linton, 2004) where
all publications are credited to the author’s affiliated university at the time of publication. Polonsky (2008) suggests that it is more appropriate to rank universities based
on current faculty members (Polonsky, 2008). Therefore,
this paper ranks top universities in innovation management research by summing the publication records of the
current faculties.

The eight top management and marketing journals are Strategic Management Journal, Management Science, Administrative Science Quarterly, Academy
of Management Review, Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Operations Management, Journal of Marketing, and Journal of Marketing Research.
b
Number of articles was computed by giving full credit for each author of an article.
c
Number of articles adjusted was computed by equally dividing one point among the authors of an article.

Affiliations of 1718 scholars were obtained from
web sites. For visiting positions, the permanent university affiliation rather than the temporary affiliation was
used. 26 scholars who retired or passed away and 120
scholars who lack a university affiliation were excluded
from the calculation. In addition, the total number (full
credit to all co-contributors) and adjusted number
(weighted method) for the remaining 1572 scholars
were computed for each university. The results are presented in Table 4.
The top 100 universities include 110 universities due
to ties in the publications. This paper demarcates the top
50 universities as “first tier” and the remaining universities as “second tier” for current innovation management
research capabilities. Based on the number of current
faculty’s research publications in the 10 top journals, the
world’s top 10 universities (including 11 universities due
to the case of ties) in innovation management research

are: (1) University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), (2)
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), (3) Michigan State University (MSU), (4) INSEAD, (5) Harvard
University and University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), (7)
Northeastern University and Texas A&M University, (9)
Stanford University, (10) Temple University and (10)
Delft University of Technology (Delf).
Follow-up research was performed to examine how
the top 10 universities established their reputation in
innovation management research. Based on the analyses,
there are three strategies: (1) building on existing university reputation, (2) retaining productive scholars, and (3)
attracting the best faculty using new strategic focus. It is
not surprising to find MIT, INSEAD, Harvard, UPenn,
Texas A&M, and Stanford in the top 10. Capitalizing on
their excellent overall university reputation, these universities have attracted faculty to advance their innovation
management research.

a
This ranking is based on the aggregation of current faculty’s all previous articles published in the 10 top journals between 1991 and 2010. The original
university rather than universities where they hold visiting scholar position, and concurrent post was used as the scholar’s current affiliation.
b
Number of articles was computed following three steps: (1) All 1572 scholars’ current affiliations were found; (2) Each scholar’s number of articles was
computed by giving full credit for each author of an article; and (3) The number of articles of each university was computed by summing up their current
faculty’s number of articles.
c
Number of articles adjusted was computed following three steps: (1) All 1572 scholars’ current affiliations were found; (2) Each scholar’s adjusted number
of articles was computed by equally dividing one point among the authors of an article; and (3) The adjusted number of articles of each university was
computed by summing up their current faculty’s adjusted number of articles.

The remaining universities appear to pursue two different strategies. Employing the strategy of “retaining
productive scholars,” MSU, Northeastern, Temple, and
Delft have done an excellent job in retaining top innovation management faculty for a long time. On the other
hand, UMKC pursued a strategy of “attracting the best
faculty using new strategic focus.” In line with Kansas
City’s entrepreneurial culture, UMKC created a strategic
focus in entrepreneurship and innovation in 2004 and
recruited Michael Song. It provided permanent university
funding, secured private and foundation funding,
recruited seven productive innovation scholars, and
created a permanent academic Department of Global
Entrepreneurship and Innovation in the Henry W. Bloch
School of Management led by a new dean with entrepreneurship and innovation expertise. UMKC’s success provides a model for universities aspiring to create and foster
excellence in a particular discipline of academic excellence. Any of the three strategies highlighted above could
be equally successful in creating research excellence and
enhancing university reputation in research and knowledge creation.

Conclusion
This paper collected research publication data from 10
top academic journals that published significant numbers
of innovation management articles between 1991 and
2010. Based on the data, this paper provides a ranking for
the world’s top innovation management scholars and top
10 innovation management universities. This paper also
identified product price and product technological
sophistication as under-researched areas. Our ranking has
several limitations. First, research publication in top academic journals is only one measure of individual or university prestige and quality. While many scholars from

highly prestigious universities are among the leading
scholars included here, some scholars from other universities with strong academic reputations are not represented. There are two possible reasons for the exclusion.
First, their innovation management research faculty is
relatively small compared to other universities. Second,
faculty in those universities may have focused on publishing books, preparing conference proceedings, or submitting to nontop academic journals. Another limitation
is that this paper used a relatively simplistic, count-based
approach. Citation impact and faculty size were not considered in this paper. Some scholars have used citation
impact (e.g., Boyd, Finkelstein, and Gove, 2005; Peng
and Zhou, 2006; Tahai and Meyer, 1999) and examined
per capita publication to rank universities (e.g., Hix,
2004; Stahl et al., 1988).
