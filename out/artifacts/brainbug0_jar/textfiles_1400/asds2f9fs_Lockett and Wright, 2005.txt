Abstract
The commercialization of university research has become an increasingly important issue, given concerns regarding licensing
and the university’s desire to maximize the returns to intellectual property (IP). In this paper, we assess the impact of university
resources and routines/capabilities on the creation of spin-out companies. We find that both the number of spin-out companies
created and the number of spin-out companies created with equity investment are significantly positively associated with expenditure on intellectual property protection, the business development capabilities of technology transfer offices and the royalty
regime of the university. These results highlight the importance not just of resource stocks, but also of developing appropriate
capabilities of technology transfer officers in spinning-out companies. The results suggest that universities and policy-makers
need to devote attention to the training and recruitment of technology officers with the broad base of commercial skills.

Policy-makers have become increasingly interested

their own science base and transferring their scientific knowledge to the private sector. The dominant
way in which technology has been traditionally transferred from the university sector to the private sector
is through technology licensing (Siegel et al., 2003b).
This system has the advantage that the academic and the
university are able to capitalize on the technology, and
the academic is able to pursue his/her research without
having to commit large amounts of time to commercial
matters. The downsides to this approach are two-fold.
First, the nature of the new technology may not be easily patented and transacted via a license agreement.

Second, universities may not be able to capture the full
value of their technology through a licensing arrangement and therefore may seek a more direct involvement
in the commercialization of new technology through
spinning-out a company (Franklin et al., 2001).
As a result, there is growing interest in the role that
university spin-out/off companies may play in the commercialization process. This increased interest is being
observed in North America, the UK, Australia and Continental Europe (DiGregorio and Shane, 2003; Wright
et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004a,b; Siegel and Phan, in
press). There is a perception that ownership of equity
in a university spin-out may increase the potential upside gain, which appears to be an attractive option to
universities. Small sample survey evidence indicates
that assuming an equity position in a university spinout company produces a greater average return in the
long run compared to the average return available from
the average license (Bray and Lee, 2000).
However, most university spin-outs do not generate substantial wealth. For example, the UK Treasurysponsored Lambert Review of business-university collaboration published at the end of 2003 considered
that too many university spin-outs were being created
and that greater focus should be placed on identifying
whether a university spin-out was the most appropriate means to exploit technological inventions produced
in universities (Lambert, 2003). While it is relatively
straightforward to create a legal entity, the act of creating a company does not necessarily mean that it will go
on to generate wealth. A key constraint on the development of spin-outs is reported by technology transfer
offices to be access to venture capital finance (Wright
et al., 2003). At the same time, venture capital firms
lament the lack of sufficient investment propositions
with attractive prospects for future wealth generation
(Lockett et al., 2002). A central issue, therefore, is the
need to examine the factors influencing the creation of
university spin-outs.
Some research attention has been addressed towards
the inputs associated with the number of spin-outs
created by US universities (DiGregorio and Shane,
2003) and the survivability of start-ups that exploit
academic knowledge (Nerkar and Shane, 2003). Case
based research on university spin-outs has examined
the phases in their development (Vohora et al., 2004)
and the strategies adopted by research institutions to
develop different types of spin-offs (Clarysse et al.,

2005). A key omission from this literature concerns
any systematic analysis of the role of the resources
and capabilities of universities and their technology
transfer offices. The importance of inter-organizational
differences with respect to resources and capabilities,
and their impact on firm behaviour and performance,
is central to the resource-based view of the firm. In
particular, issues relate to the presence of sufficient
experience and expertise within what are historically
non-commercial environments to generate gains from
spin-out ventures (Lambert, 2003). There is then a
need to examine the extent to which the capabilities
of technology transfer offices are important influences
on the generation of university spin-outs within the
context of universities’ resources and environments.
Specifically, we seek to fill this important research gap
by exploring two research questions:
Q1. What are the most important stocks of resource
inputs in the creation of university spin-outs?
Q2. What are the most important capabilities and routines for creating university spin-outs?
We address the above questions in two ways. First,
we identify the different resource stocks and capabilities required by universities to spin-out companies and
hypothesize their relationships with universities’ creation of spin-out companies. Second, we test our model
empirically using novel data from two surveys of UK
universities’ commercial exploitation of their intellectual property through the creation of university spinouts conducted in 2002 and 2003. The structure of this
paper is as follows. Section 2 defines a university spinout, while Section 3 provides a brief overview of the UK
university technology transfer context. Section 4 outlines the theoretical background of the model and outlines the hypothesized nature of the relationships to be
tested. Section 5 outlines the methodology and Section
6 presents the results. Section 7 concludes by summarizing the findings, linking the findings to the existing
literature, commenting on potential limitations of the
research and identifying areas for further research and
implications for policy-makers and practitioners.

2. What is a university spin-out?
We narrowly define university spin-outs as new ventures that are dependent upon licensing or assignment

<-----Page 2----->A. Lockett, M. Wright / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1043–1057

of the institution’s intellectual property for initiation.
This definition is consistent with that used by Association of University Technology Managers in the US. In
some cases, where permitted, the university may own
equity in the spin-out in exchange for patent rights it
has assigned or in lieu of licence for fees. The need
for such a precise definition of spin-outs arises since
a wide range of companies originate from universities. Hence, we exclude all companies not based on
technology assigned/licensed from the university, such
as companies that may be established by graduates or
university researchers that are not directly related to
intellectual assets created from research funded by government or industry.
We also distinguish between external equity backed
university spin-outs and those that do not receive such
financial support. External equity backing is early stage
funding from either large corporations or financial
intermediaries such as business angels and venture
capitalists. This distinction provides an important indicator of performance. Receipt of external equity finance
can be viewed as a signal of quality as such ventures
have successfully passed the scrutiny of professional
investors, who assess their ability to generate significant future returns (Lockett et al., 2002, 2003).2

3. The UK environment and university
spin-outs
A growing policy debate in the UK has led to
increasing pressure from government to manage university intellectual property and to realize investments
in intellectual property to generate wealth for both universities and the wider economy (HM Treasury and
DTI, 1998).
In the US, the Bayh-Dole Act stipulates that scientists must disclose inventions made during government
research to the university’s technology transfer office.
There is no such legislation in the UK. The 1997 Patents
Act states that inventions of employees who may reasonably be expected to make inventions are clearly
owned by their employer, so long as this is stated in
an employment contract. If the ownership is not stated
2 The receipt of external equity finance may also signal capitalintensity, connections of the inventors and technology transfer
offices, etc.

1045

in an employment contract then the IPR belongs to
the inventor. Universities are increasingly exerting their
property rights over inventions.
UK government intervention has involved various
initiatives to promote education and provide finance
regarding spin-outs from universities for both students
and faculty. The Higher Education Innovation Fund
(HEIF) scheme now encompasses earlier schemes such
as the Science Enterprise Challenge (SEC) and University Challenge Funds (UCF) to provide support for
universities in the to provision of education and incubator support for academic entrepreneurship (OST, 2000).
To promote spin-outs, the UK government established
the £50 million “University Challenge” venture capital
fund and created 12 Government sponsored “Science
Enterprise Centres” based in universities.
The Lambert Review pointed to the problems associated with a dominant focus on the creation of spinouts per se and argued that there was a need to develop
the skills to enable the spin-outs that are created to be
able to generate significant wealth. The government’s
response to the Lambert Review addressed issues relating both to the development of skills among technology
transfer officers and the need to create university spinouts that created wealth. While noting the development
of training for technology transfer officers by professional bodies, it also emphasized the need for further
developments in training and the use of individuals
with industry background and experience (HM Treasury, 2004).

4. Theoretical development
Most studies of university technology transfer have
focused on licensing activities of US universities (e.g.,
Thursby and Thursby, 2002; Thursby and Kemp, 2002;
Siegel et al., 2003a). Research into universities’ effectiveness at licensing has traditionally focused on a
production function type approach employing an inefficiency model (e.g., Siegel et al., 2003a). The production
functions have focused on the input of basic resource
stocks into the process, e.g., some measure of research
input, human resources, expenditure on intellectual
property protection. The inefficiency models have also
tended to focus on relatively simple determinants of
efficiency such as whether or not the university has a
medical school.

<-----Page 3----->1046

A. Lockett, M. Wright / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1043–1057

The process of spinning-out companies is – arguably
– much more complex than licensing. DiGregorio and
Shane (2003), in their examination of why some universities generate more start-ups than others, focus
on university level factors. They also control for the
number of technology transfer officers, the amount
of sponsored research expenditure and the number of
inventions. We build on this approach by arguing that
the availability of relevant expertise and processes may
be more important. For example, Clarysse et al. (2005)
identified three distinct models of managing the spinout process which require very different resources and
capabilities on behalf of the university. In order to
model the resource inputs and skills of the technology
transfer office, we employ a resource-based view of
the firm framework. Authors have drawn a distinction
between the equilibrium (or static) conceptualization
of the resource-based view of the firm (e.g., Rumelt,
1984; Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993) and the dynamic
view of the RBV in terms of capabilities and routines
(e.g., Teece et al., 1997). We follow this tradition by
drawing a simple distinction between a resource as a
stock and a capability or routine as a flow or activity.
This is consistent with Penrose (1959) who identified
resources and also the “productive services” that different collections of resources – deployed together –
can create.
Thus, our overall framework consists of two broad
elements. First, we build on existing research by
hypothesizing that a number of inputs of stocks of
resources into the commercialization process will have
a positive impact on the creation of university spinouts. Second, we consider the capabilities and routines
possessed and developed by universities that may be
expected to enable them to generate spin-outs that are
more likely to create wealth. These capabilities can be
identified in terms of business development capabilities
and routines for incentives and rewards to commercialize the technology, including the royalty regime
(Lockett et al., 2003). We expand on these arguments
below.
4.1. Resource stocks
4.1.1. Resource inputs into the university spin-out
process
The stock of technology in a university provides a
key resource input into the spin-out process. The higher

the stock of technology, the greater the scope for the
transfer of that technology. US research has suggested
that the number of invention disclosures received by a
technology transfer office is a measure of the stock of
technology at a particular time. The Bayh-Dole Act
stipulates that once a scientific discovery has been
made during research sponsored by government funding, scientists must file an invention disclosure with the
technology transfer office. Recent research conducted
on US universities by Siegel et al. (2003b) shows that
in practice, technology transfer office personnel must
typically devote substantial effort to encourage faculty
members to disclose inventions. Thursby and Kemp
(2002) found that less than half of faculty inventions
with commercial potential are disclosed to technology
transfer offices. Furthermore, using invention disclosures as a proxy for the stock of technology is very
context-specific. As noted above, policies and practices
in UK universities do not stipulate that new scientific
discoveries must be disclosed, leaving a large quantity
of a university’s exploitable intellectual assets unobservable. Using patents as a measure of technological
input also suffers from similar problems since patenting
strategies vary considerably from university to university. Some universities may generate a large number
of patents because the initial set up costs are small;
however, the costs of effectively enforcing a patent are
potentially very high. In the UK, research income is
spent to create technology. Therefore, in the light of the
shortcomings of other measures, a preferred measure
of the technology input available for commercialization may be the total research expenditure of each
institution.3 Hence:
Hypothesis 1. There is a positive relationship
between a university’s stock of technology to commercialize and the creation of university spin-outs.
Technology transfer offices evaluate new inventions
for their technological and commercial potential to
decide whether there is sufficient value to be gained
from patenting the invention (Vohora et al., 2004).
This scrutiny requires the resource of specific skills
relating to the technology and its potential market.
3 While we recognize that this measure may also have its shortcomings, it does not suffer the potential under-recording distortions
that would arise from other measures.

<-----Page 4----->A. Lockett, M. Wright / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1043–1057

This decision process may be constrained by limitations in funding and the availability of qualified human
resources. Universities can to some extent address this
problem by seeking external advice on the protection
of intellectual property. The requirement for technical and market evaluation of invention disclosures is
expensive and inevitably limited by the level of expenditure on external intellectual property legal services.
Universities may be willing to spend more on these services where they recognize that a particular invention
has strong growth prospects and is a likely candidate to
receive external equity backing. We argue that there is a
positive relationship between expenditure on intellectual property and the creation of university spin-outs.
Hence:
Hypothesis 2. There is a positive relationship
between a university’s expenditure on external intellectual property advice and the creation of university
spin-outs.
The availability of a stock of technology transfer
staff may be an important resource input into the
creation of university spin-outs (Lockett et al., 2003;
Clarysse et al., 2005). The role of the technology
transfer office staff may be particularly important given
the traditionally non-commercial nature of university
environments. The technology transfer office staff
may have an important role to play both in terms of
“business coaching” and in stimulating entrepreneurial
activity, and hence the creation of university spin-outs.
As academic inventors may not necessarily be the best
individual to recognise an opportunity (Lockett et al.,
2003), technology transfer office staff may be more
alert to such opportunities and be charged with the
responsibility to promote interest in commercialization
activities in the university. Technology transfer office
staff as insiders with close contacts with science departments may be better placed than outsiders to identify
opportunities for the creation of spin-outs. Our arguments here suggest that, ignoring skills which we consider below, the presence of technology transfer officers
will have a positive link to the creation of spin-outs.
Hence:
Hypothesis 3. There is a positive relationship
between the availability of technology transfer office
staff and the creation of university spin-outs.

1047

4.1.2. Stock of experience resource
Experience of spinning-out companies is an important resource that may increase the efficiency of a
university in spinning-out companies. Through being
actively involved in technology transfer activities, universities may become better able to create university
spin-outs. This argument is based on the notion that
the more experience the university has in spinning-out
companies, the more effective managers will become.
This will lead to a generation of excess managerial
resources that can be used to further facilitate the process (Penrose, 1959). Experience may be positively
associated with the length of time a university has been
actively involved in technology transfer activities. This
leads us to hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 4. There is a positive relationship
between a university’s experience of technology transfer activities and the creation of university spin-outs.
4.2. Capabilities and routines
4.2.1. Business development capabilities
We also examine the extent to which the university has developed relevant capabilities to spin-out
companies, since such a strategy of commercializing
technology places a number of additional requirements
on the routines/capabilities possessed by universities,
beyond those skills required for licensing (Eisenhardt
and Martin, 2000). These routines/capabilities are
likely to be unequally distributed across universities
and involve processes for assessing intellectual
property rights, processes for spinning-out companies,
and skills embodied in university staff in terms of
both managing the commercialization process and
specific technical and marketing skills. First, whether
technology is exploited through licensing or spin-out,
universities may employ clear processes for conducting intellectual property evaluation and due diligence
to ensure intellectual property rights are identified and
fully evaluated before commercialization can commence (Vohora et al., 2004). Unless new intellectual
property is shown to be exempt from potential infringements of existing patent rights and there is exclusive
‘freedom to operate’, the commercial exploitation process cannot proceed without great difficulties. If it is not
possible to secure a patent, there are likely to be major
problems in marketing and generating rents from the
technology.

<-----Page 5----->1048

A. Lockett, M. Wright / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1043–1057

Second, there is also a strong requirement for clear
policies, processes and routines for creating and developing university spin-outs. The creation of a legal entity
is relatively straightforward. However, the creation of
a university spin-out that includes legally protected
intellectual property, and the managerial and marketing skills, premises and financial resources to enable it
to develop, is more complex. These routines take time
to develop and their development is also dependent on
individual university contexts (Teece et al., 1997).
Third, the development of these routines/capabilities relies heavily upon the experience
and expertise of technology transfer office personnel. Clear processes and organizational routines in
themselves do not enable the technology transfer
process to function productively. The availability of
skilled technology transfer office staff to manage the
commercialization process is vital to the development
and implementation of these routines creation of
university spin-outs. The quality of the technology
transfer office staff is important in terms of their
marketing, technical and negotiating skills.
More developed routines and capabilities may be
associated with the selection of inventions with greater
commercialization prospects. In addition, these skills
may bring a greater ability to prepare the invention to a
state where it is ready to attract external finance. Universities may thus develop different strategies towards
the development of spin-outs depending on the extent to
which they are selective in terms of offering assistance
to potential spin-outs (Clarysse et al., 2005). Universities with greater business development capabilities may
be able to focus attention on those spin-outs, which they
perceive are going to make the greatest return. Hence:
Hypothesis 5. There is a positive relationship
between a university’s business development capabilities and the creation of university spin-outs.
4.2.2. Routines for incentives and rewards
Organizational processes and routines can be
viewed as a key resource (Barney, 1991). Organizations require routines relating to incentives and rewards
to encourage people to perform particular productive
activities (Holmstrom, 1979; Jensen, 1993). For most
universities, commercialization of research requires
radical changes in the way they have traditionally
exploited scientific discoveries (Etzkowitz, 1998). The

institutional incentive and reward routines that operate
within universities can preserve and reinforce existing cultures, organizational norms, policies and procedures. There may be a need to modify procedures
to align rewards with commercialization goals, taking
into account the characteristics, actions and motives of
key stakeholders. Siegel et al. (2003b) revealed palpable differences in these areas that can potentially
impede technology transfer.
The norms, standards and values of academic scientists reflect an organizational culture that values
creativity, innovation, and especially, the individual’s
contribution to advances in knowledge (Siegel et al.,
2003a). The primary motivation for university scientists is recognition within the scientific community.
Universities typically do not reward activities such
as commercializing research and creating new spinoffs, in their promotion and tenure decisions (Siegel et
al., 2003b). The performance evaluation process and
publishing-orientation of researchers thus act as barriers to these activities (Ndonzuau et al., 2002).
US universities benefit from the clarity of the
Bayh-Dole Act, which reduces the conflict of interest
and puts the onus on the university commercially to
exploit inventions that result from scientific research.
However, we conjecture that in the UK environment
an important and overlooked impediment to the commercialization of university intellectual property is the
unavailability of sufficient incentives and rewards for
university staff to spend time on spinouts (Lockett et
al., 2003). Lower royalty rates may be an incentive
to start a venture to exploit a technology rather than
license it (DiGregorio and Shane, 2003). An alternative explanation may be that universities seeking to
encourage the commercialization of scientific research
may be more willing to give academics larger percentages of royalty revenue, since they recognize the
potentially greater pay-offs that may result (Lockett
et al., 2003; Link and Siegel, in press). This may form
part of the array of signals to the academic that the
university is seeking to encourage technology transfer
and thus may be associated with spin-out activity.
Hence:
Hypothesis 6. There is a positive relationship
between an incentive and reward system that promotes
commercialization and the creation of university spinouts.

5. Methodology
5.1. The sample
The sample used in the study is derived from a mail
questionnaire survey conducted over a 2-year period. In
March 2002, a survey on university technology transfer
activities comprising quantitative and qualitative questionnaires was sent to the top 122 universities in the UK
as ranked by research income. These institutions were
identified using the Higher Education Statistics Agency
(HESA) publication entitled Resources of Higher Education Institutions (2000/2001). The remaining 45 universities accounted for just 0.2% (or £3.9 million) of
total research grants and contract expenditures by UK
universities in financial year 2001. We conducted an
initial telephone exercise to identify the most suitable
person to complete the questionnaire. This person was
typically the head of the technology transfer office or
their designate.
We received information from 98 universities,
including a number of nil responses where the university was not active in the field of technology transfer.
The sample we employ in our analysis only includes
those institutions that provided full information. We
obtained full disclosure for all variables from 48 universities; however, we were able to obtain partial data from
another 62 universities in order to test the representa-

1049

tiveness of our sample. The missing observations principally related to the attitudinal data, since those universities not fully active in commercialization were less
likely to be in a position to offer their views. The 48 universities account for over 66% of total research expenditure of the 98 universities that provided information.
We returned to these institutions in the spring of
2003 and obtained full data on the level of their spin-out
activity in financial year 2002. Therefore, we specify
our regression model with inputs (including capabilities) to the process in the financial year 2001 and the
creation of spin-outs in 2002.
To test for representativeness, we examined the differences between the 48 universities in our sample of
full respondents against the remaining 62 universities.
The results are presented in Table 1 and indicate that our
sample is located on the right hand side of the distribution of technology transfer activities. In particular, our
sample is significantly likely to create more spin-outs
(p < 0.01), generate more equity investment in spinouts (p < 0.01), have a greater total research income
(p < 0.01), have a greater experience of involvement in
technology transfer activities (p < 0.05), be more likely
to have a medical school (p < 0.05) and a science park
(p < 0.01). This emphasis is not surprising, since those
universities that are actively involved in spinning-out
companies will be more likely to fully complete the
questionnaire.

5.2. Deﬁnition and measurement of variables
In this section, we detail the variables we employed
in our analysis (Table 2).
5.2.1. Dependent variables
We employ two measures of spin-out activity: the
number of university spin-outs created in 2002 (USOs)
and the number of equity investments in existing spinouts (EIUSOs). EIUSOs is a count of the number of
equity investments that were made in existing spinouts during the financial year 2001–2002. We are able
to identify all university spin-outs, including those created before financial year 2002, that have attracted
external equity investment. These two variables enable
us to differentiate between potential differences in universities creating spin-outs and the creation of spin-outs
that have been validated in terms of being able to attract
external equity investment. The total number of equity
investments made may well exceed the number of university spin-outs created in 1 year, since a spin-out
may attract multiple rounds of financing in 1 year. We
wanted to be able to capture this success at raising
finance. All of this money comes from external parties
to the universities: venture capitalists, business angels,
industrial partners and university challenge funds. In
piloting the questionnaire, technology transfer managers believed that this was information that technology
transfer offices would have, since they would need to
be involved in changing shareholders’ agreements.
5.2.2. Independent variables
The independent variables we employ cover both
resource inputs of the universities into the commercial-

ization process and the capabilities of the universities.
Data for the independent variables was collected for
the financial year 2001 and data on outputs (i.e. the
creation of spin-outs and equity investments in spinouts) related to 2002. This lagged approach enables us
to partially overcome problems associated with endogeneity.
A university’s investment in research was measured
in terms of its total research income (TRESI). This data
is collected in the UK by the Higher Education Business Interaction survey conducted by the government’s
Department of Trade and Industry. We employed a natural log transformation of this variable in our analysis
due to the skewed distribution of the research incomes
of universities.
A university’s expenditure on the protection of its
intellectual property was measured in terms of spending on external legal fees, patent costs and specialist intellectual property consultancy advice (IPEXP).
Technology transfer office staff may provide some
intellectual property advice, but universities commonly
also seek professional advice externally. The inclusion of this variable is consistent with previous studies
from the US (see e.g., Siegel et al., 2003b). Again,
we employed a natural log transformation due to the
skewed distribution between the expenditures of universities.
A university’s input of people into the technology transfer process was measured in terms of the
number of full time equivalents (FTEs) employees
working in the university’s technology transfer office
(TTSTAFF). This variable includes IP and licensing
staff, but excludes staff employed in separate science
parks and incubators.

A university’s experience of technology transfer
(EXPER) was measured in terms of the number of
years the university had been involved in the activity,
defined as the first year in which the university had first
dedicated at least 0.5 FTEs toward technology transfer
activities.
In the absence of existing scales relating to the business development capabilities, incentives and rewards
and access to external funding in the university commercialization context, we conducted detailed case
study interviews to identify the appropriate dimensions
to include in the questionnaire (Vohora et al., 2004).
The interviews revealed a number of key capabilities
that universities require in order to effectively spinout companies. These capabilities we term: Business
Development, Incentives and Rewards and Access to
Equity Finance.
The Business Development Capability construct
(BDCAP) relates to the extent to which the university has clear processes for spinning-out companies.
Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
the following elements either promote or impede the
spinning-out companies in their university. The Likert scale ranged from 1 = strongly impeded; 3 = no
effect; 5 = strongly promoted the spinning-out of companies. The four elements were: the marketing, technical, negotiating skills of the university staff involved in
commercialisation; the availability of a clear process
for conducting intellectual property rights due diligence; the availability of a clear process for spinningout companies; and the availability of university staff
to manage the commercialisation process. With reference to these statements, a summated average scale
was calculated (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.86). Note that
BDCAP and TTSTAFF are complementary, since for
the BDCAP scale, we ask the respondents whether
the availability of staff either impedes or promotes the
development of spin-out companies. Hence, BDCAP
focuses on whether universities have enough staff for
the job while TTSTAFF relates to the absolute number
of staff. The correlation between these two variables is
low at 0.37.
The Incentives and Rewards construct (INCENT)
relates to the routines of the university for implementing the necessary incentives and rewards to facilitate the
process of spinning-out companies. Respondents were
asked to rate the availability of incentives and rewards
for university staff to spend time on spin-outs; the avail-

1051

ability of incentives and rewards to attract commercial
management to spin-outs; the availability of incentives
and rewards for academics to commercialise research.
Respondents rated each item in terms of the extent
to which the factor had either impeded or promoted
the spinning-out of companies; the Likert scale ranged
from 1 = strongly impeded; 3 = no effect; 5 = strongly
promoted the spinning-out of companies. With reference to these statements, a summated average scale was
calculated (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.72). The ROYALTY
variable is defined as the percentage of net revenue
from executed licences that go to the inventor, which
typically is defined at the level of a university policy.
Finally, we employed three control variables—
whether or not the university has a medical school
(MEDSCH), whether or not the university had a science park (SCIPRK) and the R&D intensity of the
region (R&D). These variables were employed to control for the high resource requirements of a medical
school, which have proved to be a significant drain on
a universities ability to transfer technology via licensing when research expenditure is controlled for (see
Siegel et al., 2003a). A Science Park may be viewed as
a technology catalyst that may facilitate the creation of
spin-outs; however, work from the UK has found the
impact of science parks to be negligible (see Siegel et
al., 2003). Finally, we follow (Siegel et al., 2003a) and
employ an environmental control, that of R&D intensity among local firms. R&D intensity is a measure of
the level of spending by industry per capita on R&D at
the regional level.4

6. Data and empirical results
Descriptive statistics relating to the selected dependent, independent and control variables are reported in
Tables 2 and 3. Our sample of 48 universities generated a mean of 1.98 spin-outs and 3.04 spin-outs with
equity investments. There is a substantial dispersion
between the different universities in terms of the number of spin-outs and spin-outs with equity investments
they can generate (Table 3). Of the 48 universities, 18
4 GDP and R&D measures were provided by the UK Office for
National Statistics. Regional GDP is reported as an index of GDP per
capita. R&D expenditure is reported as business R&D expenditure
per capita.

generated no spin-outs and 17 generated no spin-outs
with equity investments in the financial year 2002.
The correlation matrix of all the continuous variables in the analysis is presented in Table 4. As
expected, the variables relating to the creation of USO
companies, whether or not external equity backed, were
positively correlated. Unsurprisingly, some potential
for multi-collinearity was found to be present in
the data, especially in relation to the relationships
between TRESINC and IPEXP (r = 0.51), TRESINC
and TTSTAFF (r = 0.47), and TTSTAFF and EXPER
(r = 0.67), TRESINC and EXPER (r = 0.56), EXPER
and IPEXP (r = 0.45), BDCAP and IPEXP (r = 0.55)
and BDCAP and EXPER (r = 0.48). In order to investigate the extent to which this was a problem, an OLS
analysis was performed in order to compute variance
inflation factor (VIF) scores. The VIFs computed for

all the variables were found not to exceed 2.5, which is
well within the acceptable guideline of 10 (see Hair et
al., 1998); therefore, multi-collinearity was eliminated
as a potential problem.
We also conducted bivariate Chi-squared tests
between the binary variables MEDSCH and SCIPARK.
The Pearson Chi-squared value was 0.80 (p = 0.372),
indicating that the association was not statistically significant at conventional levels.
The distribution of the dependent variables (or
rather their error terms) meant that we could not
simply use an OLS technique. The hypotheses were
tested using Poisson and negative binomial regression
techniques. Furthermore, we computed all our results
with robust coefficients. The basic Poisson model is
restricted by the imposition of an equal conditional
mean and variance (Hausman et al., 1984). A problem

arises where there is over-dispersion in the data,
that is where the variance of the dependent variable
exceeds the mean. This problem may be addressed
by adopting a negative binomial model that allows for
over-dispersion (Cameron and Trivedi, 1986). We test
for over-dispersion and select the Poisson or negative
binomial approach as appropriate.
Our analysis first examined the generation of university spin-outs. In total, we tested four different models. Model 1 included measures of stocks of resource
inputs with our controls: USOs = f{TRESINC, IPEXP,
TTSTAFF, EXPER, MEDSHC, SCIPRK, R&D}.
Model 2 was our full model that included all of
our variables: USOs = f{TRESINC, IPEXP, TTSTAFF,
EXPER, BDCAP, ROYALTY, INCENT, MEDSHC,
SCIPRK, R&D}. As the error term was not found to
be over-dispersed, we employed a Poisson regression.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table 5.
The equations for both models are strongly significant and the results indicate that the resource inputs
for universities’ involvement in spin-out creation are
significantly related to spin-out creation. In particular, model 1 finds TRESINC (p < 0.05) and IPEXP
(p < 0.05) to be significant, with a Pseudo R2 of 0.28.
In the full model (model 2), the Pseudo R2 increases
to 0.34, but TRESINC ceases to be significant while
the significance of the IPEXP term is reduced to

1053

the p < 0.1 level. Both the BDCAP and ROYALTY
terms introduced in this model are significant (p < 0.1)
although the stock of experience (EXPER) and the
more general incentives routine variable (INCENT) is
not significant.5 These results provide evidence that
although resource inputs into the process of spinningout companies from universities may be important, it
is also important to have the necessary business development capabilities. The results provide limited support for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3, but consistent
support for Hypothesis 2 and indicate that stocks of
resource inputs are important in terms of generating
spin-out activity. Hypothesis 4 is not supported, but
there is support for Hypothesis 5 that a university’s
business development capabilities are important for a
strategy of spinning-out companies.
We reran the analysis with external equity investments in spin-outs as the dependent variable. We ran
two different regression models which mirrored our
approach for the spin-outs. Model 3 included measure
for stocks of resource inputs with our controls: EIUSOs = f{TRESINC, IPEXP, TTSTAFF, EXPER, MEDSCH, SCIPRK, R&D}. Model 4 included all of our
variables: EIUSOs = f{TRESINC, IPEXP, TTSTAFF,
EXPER, BDCAP, ROYALTY, INCENT, MEDSCH,
SCIPRK, R&D}. As the error term was over-dispersed,
we employed a negative binomial approach for models
3 and 4. The results of this analysis are presented in
Table 6.
The equations are strongly significant. The results
are broadly consistent with the findings for models 1 and 2, but there are some notable differences.
TRESINC is now insignificant in both models. IPEXP
is highly significant (p < 0.01) in model 3, but becomes
less significant (at p < 0.05) in model 4. Interestingly,
the significance of the business development capabilities (BDCAP) variable is stronger in respect of spinouts with external equity backing (model 4; p < 0.05)
than for the number of spin-outs (model 2, p < 0.1).6
Our full model here has a Pseudo R2 of 0.19. These
results emphasize the importance of both the stocks
5 To examine the possibility of non-linear experience effects, we
also ran the regressions with experience squared, but the coefficients
were insignificant and are not reported here.
6 Also, as for model 2, we tested for non-linearities in experience
by including a squared term, but the coefficient was insignificant and
the findings are not reported here.

of resource inputs for spinning-out companies and the
capabilities and routines of the university. The results
again provide evidence to support Hypothesis 2, that
spending on external IP protection is an important
resource input into the process; however, the other
stocks of resource inputs (Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3) are not significant when we include experience
and capabilities in our model. As before, our results fail
to find support for Hypothesis 4 about the importance
of the experience of the technology transfer office, but
support Hypothesis 5 that the business development
capabilities have a significant impact on the ability of
a university to generate spin-outs that attract external
equity finance. There is mixed support for Hypothesis
6 as royalty payments to academics had a significant
impact on the creation of spin-outs with equity investment, but this is not the case for incentive and reward
regimes in general.

7. Conclusions and implications
This study draws on novel data from a sample of
universities that account for the vast majority of university commercialization activity in the UK to identify

the factors influencing the creation of university spinouts. A central aspect of our analysis, which has been
neglected in previous studies, is the distinction between
the stock of resources of technology transfer offices and
the capabilities and routines developed by the technology transfer office staff. We find that the only stock of
resource inputs that is important in universities’ creation of spin-outs and of spin-outs that attract external
equity finance was expenditure on intellectual property
protection. In terms of the capabilities and routines of
the university, we find that the business development
capabilities are significant. The results relating to business development capabilities indicate that the level of
significance is greater for those spin-outs with external equity investments than for the regression relating
to the creation of spin-outs. These findings provide an
important additional novel insight by emphasizing that
it is the expertise of technology transfer staff that is
important.
The components of the business capability development variable suggest that the creation of capabilities
related to clear processes for conducing intellectual
property rights due diligence and the creation of
spin-out companies, and the availability of adequately
trained staff are important determinants of a university’s success in creating spin-outs and externally
equity backed spin-outs. However, neither of the other
qualitative measures, the availability of incentives and
rewards, and external relational capabilities relating
to obtaining finance was significant in any of the
models.
This paper adds to the existing literature in several
ways. First, our findings are consistent with those of
DiGregorio and Shane (2003) for the US who found
only intermittent support for the number of technology
transfer office staff as a control variable. However, we
extend their study by considering explicitly the capabilities of universities, which we find to be a significant
determinant of differences in spin-out activity between
universities. Second, our study links to the work of
Thursby and Thursby (2002) on the role of technology
transfer office ability and knowledge, who suggest the
possibility of learning by doing effects on the ability
of technology transfer officers in the context of licensing in the US. Our findings indicate for spin-outs in the
UK, that the stock of experience in terms of the number
of years involvement with technology transfer does not
appear to be important per se, but rather the skills accru-

<-----Page 12----->A. Lockett, M. Wright / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1043–1057

ing to technology transfer officers and the presence of
technology transfer routines. Third, our findings shed
light on suggestions from earlier qualitative research.
Based on their qualitative US evidence, Siegel et al.
(2003a) suggest that a lack of requisite business skills
and expertise, especially marketing as opposed to the
prevalent legalistic skills, could have a significant deleterious effect on technology transfer. Clarysse et al.
(2005), in their qualitative analysis of different university spin-out development models across Europe,
identified some universities that were competence deficient in terms of having the appropriate expertise to
development spin-outs. Our study provides quantitative
analysis that directly links the capabilities of technology transfer officers to the extent of spin-out creation.
Vohora et al. (2004), using interview data from the
UK, suggested that post-creation there is a need for
spin-outs to access appropriate resources and particularly capabilities to develop through different phases of
development. Our findings suggest that further quantitative research of the post-creation phases of spin-out
development would be useful to understand the extent
to which deficiencies in the capabilities of technology
transfer offices have a continuing constraining effect
on the development of spin-outs.
Our analysis also provides further quantitative evidence concerning the importance of incentives and
rewards. DiGregorio and Shane (2003) find that maintaining a low inventor’s share of royalties increases new
firm formation. Siegel et al. (2003a) find in their survey
and interview evidence from scientists and technology
transfer officers that shortcomings in incentives and
rewards were a barrier to technology transfer. We are
also able to offer more fine-grained insight, since we
find that royalty payments in particular are significantly
positively associated with spin-out activity, whereas the
general presence of incentive routines is not statistically significant.
This paper has a number of limitations that may help
explain some of the insignificant findings and which
suggest areas for further research. The lack of significance of variables may be associated with statistical and
methodological issues relating to the relatively small
sample size, sample selection, measurement problems
and construct validity. These difficulties raise potentially interesting avenues for further research. Although
we undertook extensive efforts to obtain as large a
sample as possible that was representative of spin-out

1055

activity, our efforts were restricted by the current state
of development of both university spin-out activity in
the UK and the information systems of universities. As
technology transfer activities develop, there is scope
for longitudinal analysis to examine the changing relationships between spin-out creation, stocks of resource
inputs and capabilities.
Our empirical analysis was conducted at the university level. As such, we used measures of aggregate technology transfer office experience and thus, could not
examine the experience of individual technology transfer officers. Further work in this area might usefully
take into account the skills of the team of technology
transfer officers in a particular university. For example,
the extent to which the range of skills available covers
the scope of scientific disciplines in a university and the
extent of prior business start-up experience by technology transfer officers may have important links with the
creation of spin-outs that are successful.
As technology transfer through spin-outs spreads,
future research may also be able to utilize larger samples for the UK. Additionally, the growth in spin-out
activity in other countries including the US, Europe,
Canada, Australia, etc. suggests scope for the utilization of larger combined samples which may also be able
to consider the effects of different institutional environments on the extent and nature of spin-out activity.
Although we have tested direct relationships
between resources, capabilities and spin-outs, we
do not examine the potential relationship between
resources and capabilities. We acknowledge that
resources are an important input into capabilities, but
it is not feasible to test this relationship because of the
small sample size and because of the cross-sectional
nature of the independent variables. Future research
needs to develop a dataset to enable such testing. Such
analysis may also enable exploration of the extent to
which certain stocks of resource inputs and capabilities
are complementary or substitutes.
A final area for further consideration concerns the
appropriate measures of technology transfer office outputs. By considering both the numbers of spin-outs
created and the number of spin-outs created with external equity, we have extended existing research and
attempted to address policy-makers concerns about
the wealth creating benefits of university technology
transfer. As university technology transfer develops,
it may be feasible to incorporate more direct mea-

<-----Page 13----->1056

A. Lockett, M. Wright / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1043–1057

sures of success such as capital gains from initial public offerings and sales to existing corporations, but at
present, the extent of these realizations of investments
in spin-outs is sporadic. A further dimension of output
measurement is spin-out survival, but this is distorted
where technology transfer offices adopt different policies towards winding up spin-outs that have clearly
failed to get off the ground. For an overall assessment
of the output of technology transfer offices, consideration needs to be given to the development of multiple
criteria that incorporate both revenue generation from
licensing and the various dimensions of spin-out activity and success identified here.
Our results provide insights into the operation of
university technology transfer office activities and have
important implications for practitioners and policymakers. Although resource inputs are important, especially expenditure on intellectual property rights protection, their significance is reduced when we examine
the impact of experience and capabilities as well as
resource inputs. The significance of intellectual property rights protection expenditure in the context of
spin-outs with external investment signals the need for
technology transfer offices to make sure intellectual
property is clean, well-defined and protected before
trying to raise external equity finance.
Finally, the findings presented here regarding the
importance of business development capabilities suggest that universities need to think of the experience
and skills of their staff if they are to create spin-outs
that create wealth. Hence, university policies to pursue growth in the size of technology transfer offices
without also focusing on the capabilities base may
not be conducive to meeting revenue objectives for
technology transfer activities. Our findings also stress
that approaches to professionalize technology transfer
offices by government and professional associations,
need to emphasize the broad array of business skills.
The finding of a significant relationship between intellectual property protection expenditure and spin-out
activity emphasizes the lack of internal skills in this
area, as has also been noted in reviews of technology
transfer practices (Zeitlyn and Horne, 2002). Training
in this skills area may have attractions to universities in
reducing external payments. Our evidence with respect
to capabilities and routines adds further weight to calls
for the development of the broad range of commercial
skills of technology transfer officers.
