<-----Page 3----->,icorporation is a collective enterprise. Shareholders and creditors provide financial capital, ~vhilemanagers and employees offer up
expertise, loyalty, and long hours. In making these contributions, individuals rvho participate in corporations often expose themselves to
great risk of loss from other participants' failures or misbehavior.' Yet
investments are made, companies are built, and value is created from
complex joint production.
How is this done? Contemporary legal scholarship generally assumes that shareholders, creditors, managers, and employees cooperate ~vitheach other because the rnarket and the law give them incentives to do so. In accord rvith conventional economic analysis, these
parties are presumed to be rational actors concerned only with maximizing their oTvn gains. Thus the primal? factors thought to discourage corporate participants from stealing, shirking their duties, or othenvise mistreating each other are rnarket incentives and legal rules,
including contract rules. These assumptions are embedded in the
modern vierv that the corporation is best understood as a "nexus of
contracts," a collection of express and implied agreements voluntarily
negotiated among the rationally selfish actors who join in the corporate enterprise.'
In this Article we take a different approach. Although we do not
abandon economic analysis, we revisit one of its basic assumptionsthe assumption that people alrvays behave in a rationally selfish
fashion.' lye posit that corporate participants cooperate ~ i t heach

ones. In particular, we argue that the behavioral pheno~nerlaof internalized trust and trustzuo-/lthin~ss
play important roles in discouragirlg
opportunistic behavior among corporate participants. (Because these
two behaviors are so closely linked, we sometimes refer to the combination as "trust behavior," or simply "trust.")'
14'e contend that people often trust, and often behave trustivorthily, to a far greater degree than can possibl~be explained by legal or
market incentives. Although this picture of internalized trust conflicts
with the neoclassical portrait of horno pconornicus as a hyperrational,
purely self-interested actor, it is supported not only by casual obsex~ation but by an ovenuhelming amount of empirical e~idence.Decades
of experimental ~vorkon human behavior in "social dilemmas" establishes that trust is a reality.' This work also demonstrates that people
do not trust randomly. To the contrary, a variet~-of factors have been
identified that predictably elicit greater or lesser degrees of trust.
One of the most important is social contex-indi\idua1s3 perceptions of
others'motivations, beliefs, likely behaviors, and relationships to themselves. By manipulating social context, experimenters can reliably
produce eventhing from nearly universal trust to an almost complete

These behavioral findings have enormous importance for a wide
range of social and legal relationships and institutions in which cooperative, other-regarding behavior is of value. Examples include marriages, nonprofit firms, "relational" contracts, even the community as
a whole." In this Article, horvever, rve focus on one particular institution in which we believe trust plays an especially critical role-the
business corporation.
We believe that an understanding of the role of trust and of the
variables that encourage or discourage it is essential for understanding both the business rvorld and much of corporate law. Focusing on
the role of trust sheds light on a number of debates and difficulties in
corporate scholarship. Examples include the nature of corporate fiducia? duties, the ways in which corporate case law constrains and directs behavior, and the puzzling persistence of cooperative patterns of
behavior in firms in circumstances in which legal and market sanctions are ineffective or unavailable. Accordingly, we suggest there is
tremendous value to be added by incorporating the phenomenon of
trust into legal scholarship. There is also danger in failing to do sodanger not only for academics but for larmakers, practicing lar\?-ers,
and businessfolk. This is because one of the most important lessons of
trust is that cooperation is not always best promoted by promising rewards and threatening punishments. To the contrary, attempt? to
employ external incentives can often reduce levels of trust and trustworthiness within the firm by eroding corporate participants' internal
motivations.
We begin our analysis in Part I by defining what rve mean by
"trust" and "trust-tvorthiness." We describe trust as a willingness to

<-----Page 6----->make oneself vulnerable to another, based on the belief that the
trusted person will choose not to exploit one's vulnerability (that is,
will behave trustworthily). We then develop the idea of trustx-orthiness as an unwillingness to exploit a trusting person's vulnerability
even when external rewards favor doing so. Our focus is on the importance of internal factors-tastes, preferences, intrinsic characterin producing trustworthiness that in turn encourages trust in others.
We then turn to the question of why trust and trusnvorthiness may
have special importance in business institutions. It is widely recognized that one of the most pressing economic problems associated
with doing business in the corporate form is the "agency cost" problem of encouraging managers, employees, and other corporate agents
faithfully to s e i ~ ethe firm's interests rather than their own. We have
also recently argued elsewhere that a second key economic problem
in corporations is the "team production" problem of encouraging
corporate participant? to make mutual investments that expose them
to each other's opportunism.' Market incentives and legal sanctions
can reduce agency costs and foster team production to some extent.
But markets and law work best when the situation is transparent and
opportunistic behavior can be detected and punished. Tv.ust m n 7iiork
even when the situation is opaque. AS a result, business firms that cultivate and support trust can enjoy a competitive advantage over those
that do not. This reality is well-recognized among management theorists and business consultants, ~ v h ohave produced an extensive literature on the importance of creating and maintaining trust ttithin and
bet-tveen business organizations."he
centrality of trust to business
firms has been overlooked, however, by contractarian corporate
scholars who emphasize market incentives, enforceable contracts, and
other external constraints on opportunism ~vithinfirms.
Mrhy is this so? Part of the answer may lie in the observation that

re,

<-----Page 7----->trust behavior in business firms often occurs in circumstances in which
cooperation is consistent with, rather than contrary to, external legal
and market incentives." When a manager refrains from stealing, she
may do this because she is intrinsically trustworthy, but she may also
do it because she is afraid of being fired or ending up in jail. As a result, it can be tempting to assume that external incentives cause all the
cooperative, coordinated behavior we obseme. Legal scholars may be
particularly prone to jump to this conclusion. Legal analysis focuses
on case law, and case law usually involves situations in which trust and
cooperation have broken d o ~ \ nand the parties seek to invoke legal
sanctions. Hence, it may be especially easy for legal scholars to assume that it is the threat of the law that reins in mishehaxior in all
situations.
We demonstrate in Part I1 that such an assumption is mistaken.
I've do this by re\riewing the extensive empirical evidence that has
been developed on trust, focusing particularly on experimental studies of behavior in "social dilemmas." Social scientists use the phrase
"social dilemma" to refer to situations that present incentives resembling those in the more familiar "prisoner's dilemma" game, such that
cooperating is the worst strategy for the individual but the best for the
group as a ~vhole. Experimental elidence of behavior in social dilemma games is highly relevant to trust for tlvo reasons. First, the optimal outcome requires the players both to trust (to make themselves
wlnerable by cooperating) and to be trusncorthy (to refrain from "defecting" and exploiting the vulnerabilih of the other players). Second-and in marked contrast to the business world, where trust behavior often is consistent wit11 external incentives-a social dilemnla
experiment can be structured to eliminate any possibility of external
incentive for cooperation. Social dilemma experiments thus isolate
and highlight the pervasive and powerf~~l
effects of internalized trust.
I'Vhat do social dilemnla experiments teach us? Over the past four
decades, experimenters have conducted hundreds of these studies.
Five interesting and consistent results have emerged from these efforts. First, social dilemnla experiments irref~ltablydemonstrate that
human beings do not behave in the strictly individualistic and selfinterested way that economic theoly often implies they do. Rather,
they behave as if they sometimes have a preference or "taste" for cooperative, other-regarding behavior generally and for trusting and

,SPP znji-n text accompan)ing note 98 (discussing how reducing the cost associated
tvith trustxvorth~behavior increases the i ~ l c i d e ~ l cofe trust).

<-----Page 8----->trusnvorthy behavior specifically.10 Second, the elidence suggests that
different individuals vary in their willingness to trust and to be trust~vorthvin new situations. Thirdly, these differences seem due at least
in part to differences in experience, hinting that trust may be a
learned behavior.
But even among those inclined toward trust, their inclination is
not absolute. X fourth fundamental finding of the social dilemma
studies is that trust is socinlb contingent. Individuals in social dilemmas
decide to cooperate or defect not primarily by calculating their individual payoffs but instead by looking at and trying to decipher others'
beliefs, likely behaviors, and social relationships \+ith themselves. For
example, experimenters have found that cooperation in social dilemmas is dramatically enhanced when the experimenter states (or
even hints) that the players ought to cooperate, when the players
share a sense of group identity, and ~ c h e nthe players expect their fellows to behave cooperatively. These are striking findings because such
social variables do not change the economic structure of the game.
Defecting remains the optimal strategy for the self-interested player.
The obsemation that social context plays a critical role in determining whether individuals trust or distrust should not be taken to
imply, however, that economic variables are irrelevant. A fifth significant finding of social dilemma experiments is that, even while people
cooperate far more than the homo econo~niczrsmodel would predict,
trust behavior does respond to economic incentives. In particular, as
the personal cost of choosing cooperation over defection rises for individual players, the likelihood of cooperation decreases. Although
most people are willing to behave in an other-regarding fashion when
the social context is right and the personal sacrifice involved is relatively small, as the cost of trust rises, trust tends to disappear.

selfishly. But ~vhenthe social conditions are right, their cooperative,
other-regarding personalities emerge. Social "framing," tempered by
considerations of personal costs, plays a critical role in determining
whether or not individuals choose to trust and be trustworthy.
In Part 111, Lve consider h o ~ cthe insights developed in Parts I and
I1 shed light on three enduring puzzles in corporate scholarship. The
first is the nature and meaning of the concept of fiduciary d u ~ We
.
argue that the phenomenon of trust aids our understanding of the
elusive idea of fiduciary obligation because it suggests that the essence
of a fiduciary relationship is the legal expectation that the fiducian.
~villadopt the other-regarding preference function that is the hallmark of trusncorthy behavior. Moreover, the law encourages fiduciaries to do this not only or even primarily by threatening punishment
but bv framing the relationship between the fiduciary and her beneficiary as one that calls for a psychological conlnlitment to trusnvorthy,
other-regarding behavior. This approach offers important insights
into the bitter and ongoing debate benceen "contractarian" and "anticontractarian" corporate scholars over ~chetherofficers' and directors'
fiduciary duties ought to be thought of as just another set of negotiable provisions in the nexus of contracts that supposedly makes up the
firm.'' In particular, it supports the anticontractarian position that allo~vingcorporate fiduciaries to "opt out" of their lovalh duties would
undermine the principal function of the fiduciary concept-to trigger
trust behalior by signaling that the social context calls for trust.
\Ye then turn to a second mystery of corporate la~z--the puzrling
relationship benceen the corporate director's duty of care and the
business judgment rule." Case law supposedly requires directors to
of trust behavior. If one assumes, as economists generall) do, that behavior reflect?
tastes and "re\-ealed preferences," the evidence suggests that most people shift readil!
fro111a self'centered, 1-oriented preference function that considers onl) their orvn payoffs, to an other-regarding, rueoriented preference function that incorporates concern
for others' welfare.

l i The relationship between the duty of care and the businessjudgment rule is one
of the thorniest problems in contemporary corporate law. See ROBERIC. CI..\RK,

<-----Page 10----->exercise due care. This requirement, ho~vever,is rarely enforced.
While judges frequently moralize about the importance of care, the
business judgement rule and a varieh of other doctrines and arrangements ensure that careless directors are largely immune from
any realistic threat of monetary liability. If one views directors as
purely self-interested actors, this inevitably raises the question of ~vhy
directors of publicly held corporations (who are often significantly insulated from shareholders'-or
anyone's-control)
should be expected to exercise due care. The phenomenon of trust offers an answer. By articulating a social expectation that directors ~villexercise
due care, judicial opinions on the duty of care may influence directors' behavior not so much by changing their external incentives as by
changing their internal pr@rences."
This approach explains the
schizophrenic quality of modern case law on the d u of~ care, ~chich
generally exhorts directors to meet a high standard of behavior ~vhile
simultaneously declining to impose liabilih for failing to meet that
standard.
Finally, we consider how trust highlights the potentially limited
importance of law in promoting cooperation in firms. To illustrate,
we consider the case of the closely held corporation. It is widely recognized that participants in closely held corporations face a high risk

market incentives provide imperfect solutions to such mutual vulnerability.'' M'e explore how other forces can supplement the market and
legal rules as means of deterring misbehavior in closelv held firms. In
particular, we consider how processes of self selection and partner selection may favor the participation of high-trust individuals in closely
held firms while working to exclude those who are less likely to trust
and be trusnvorthy. This approach suggests 1101~cooperative relationships can develop and thrive in the absence of l a ~ cor markets. It also
illustrates how using legal rules, including contract, to discourage opportunistic behalior can, in some situations, be not only unnecessary
but counterproductive, increasing the likelihood of the very sort of
misbehavior against which it was intended to protect.
We conclude in Part IV that the time has come to incorporate the
reality of trust behavior into the analysis of corporations and corporate law. One of the most important lessons of the experimental evidence on trust behavior is that trust often depends on social context.
Case law, statutes, lawyers' memoranda, and even scholars' writings
are part of that context. I'Vhen lawmakers, scholars, and practicing
attorneys fail to take account of trust, they may not only fail to understand behavior ~jithinthe firm-they may distort it.

<-----Page 13----->party has reason to behave trustworthily. We see these reasons as being lavered like an onion, with the outside layers representing the
most obvious and calculating of reasons and the inside layers representing deeper sources of trust that spring from the trusting parn's
\rie\vs about the personal preferences and basic character of the
trusted partv.

1. Legal Sanctions
The most ob~iousreason whv Ann might trust Beth would be that
Ann knows that untrustworthiness might subject Beth to legal sanctzony.
For example, Ann might "trust" Beth not to steal her art collection
because to do so would be theft, and Ann kno~lsthat Beth knows that
stealing is illegal.
The notion that legal rules are needed to curb opportunistic behavior dates back at least to Thomas ~ o b b e s . ' "But consider the magnitude of the information and the resources needed for legal sanctions, alone, to work. Ann must be able to detect Beth's illegal act and
Beth must knon Ann can do so. (This could be a problem, for example, if Beth claims that the art collection $$asstolen b\ a burglar.)
Both parties must belie~ethat there is a high probabilih that a theft
would be prosecuted or that a civil claim would be brought, that the
court would find Beth guilh or liable, and that Beth would be punished or required to pa\ damages. And both parties must believe that
the resulting sanction would be severe enough (after discountiilg foi
the possibilih that Beth's treachery would never be discovered oi successfullv sanctioned) to make the theft unattractive.
These strong requirements suggest that, in manv cases, the threat
of legal sanctions will impose onlv a weak constraint on Beth's beha\ior. The ob\ious corollarv is that legal rules ma\ rarely be the sole, or
e\en priman', reason Ann would trust Beth.

2. Market Sanctions
Going deeper, we find a second categon' of reasons for Ann to belieke that Beth will behake trustrvorthih. This second categon rests on
the notion that Beth might have external incentives to refrain frorn
abusing Ann's trust if stealing or shirking lvould signal to others in the
marketplace-including
Ann herself-that Beth cannot be trusted.
Ann might calculate, for example, that she can trust Beth because if

declining to deal with Beth in the future or by requiring her to put up
a substantial deposit if she $$ants to use Ann's apartment the next
?1
summer.
Eken if Ann and Beth are unlikely to deal with each other again,
similar considerations apply in situations in which they are likely to
deal ~ i t h
third parties who kno~veach of them. If Beth is a research
assistant for one of Ann's colleagues, for example, Beth might fear
that if she does not care for Ann's apartment faithfully, her reputation
for trustworthiness among Ann's colleagues might suffer. Thus, Beth
might do a good job not because she fears that Ann hill refuse to deal
nith her in the future but because she fears that other potential trading partners 1411shun her." It is also possible that third parties might
not only become more reluctant to do business with Beth but also subject her to cold stares, unpleasant remarks, and other "social sanctions." This latter possibilit) prolides the foundation for much of the
mushrooming contemporan' literature on law and social norms.13
In this Article we combine fear of retaliation, reputational loss,
and social sanctions together under the label of market sanctzons, because all three constrain and direct behavior b\ changing indiliduals'
perceptions of their future opportunities for beneficial exchanges
with others." Rational choice theorists ha\e placed a great deal of
emphasis on such external rewards and punishments as sources of
trust. For example, in his preeminent article on "calculati\e" trust,

<-----Page 16----->Fear of retaliation, loss of reputation, and social sanctions may indeed provide important motives for cooperative behavior in many social interactions. But such motivations continue to rely on a view of
people as always strategic, calculating, and self-interested. Moreover,
note again the demanding information and resource requirements
that must be met for such external forces to constrain Beth and,
therefore, to provide the basis for Ann's trust in Beth. Beth must
know that if she behaves untrusnvorthily, Ann will realize that her resulting loss was due to Beth's unfaithf~~lness
rather than to bad luck or
other factors. Beth must also know that Ann \+dl be willing to incur
the future cost of not doing business with Beth in order to punish
Beth, or the possibly higher cost of making it widely known to other
potential trading partners that Beth abused Ann's trust."' In the latter
case, Beth must know that others will be able to verify that Beth
abused Ann's trust (or at least be willing to believe ,Inn) and will inflict costs on Beth by refusing to d o business with her, charging her a
higher price, or punishing her with social sanctions. Finally, Ann
must know that Beth knows all of these things.
Because the costs involved in emplo$ng legal and market sanctions to enforce trustworthiness can be so high, there is reason to suspect that other influences may be at work as well. Calculative trust
may not be all, or even the most important part of the ston.

3. Internalized Trust
So we turn finally to the deepest laver of the onion-the
constraints on Beth's behavior that mall come from Beth's internalized
belief that she ought not to abuse Ann's trust. We posit that in some
circumstances Beth mav have a taste or preference for b e h a ~ i n gtrustworthily toward Ann, even if untrustrt'orthv b e h a ~ i o would
r
not trigger
any external sanction. If Ann believes that Beth's desire to behave
trustworthily is strong enough to deter Beth from taking advantage of
Ann, Ann mav conclude it is safe to make herself vulnerable to Beththat is, to trust Beth.
Henceforth we shall use the term "trust" to refer to this sort of in-

people adopt other-regarding preferences. Other-regarding preferences, in turn, explain both xvhy people are willing to incur costs to comply with social norr~msand why
the! are willing to incur costs to enforce them.

O n e has to ask wh!- Ann rnight be wdling to spread the .i\ord that Beth had
abused her trust. This could be quite costl!- to .Ann if others took it as a signal that A111

does. Dictionan definitions of trust, for example, center on the
trusted person's essential integrity and character, rather than on
whether he or she has external incentives to refrain from exploiting

But the idea of internalized trust also poses a fundamental challenge to the neoclassical model of human behavior driven by rational
self-interest. Internalized trust implies either that Beth altruistically

resulting tension between trust and rational self-interest may explain
why economists and legal scholars who rely on economic analysis tend
to focus on the role external incentives play in explaining cooperative
behavior in general and trust beha~iorin particular." This tendency

Second, given that internalized trust exists, economic analysis itself predicts that it is likely to be an important and potent force in
business organizations. This is because trust offers distinct efficiency
advantages for both individuals and institutions, including but not
limited to the institution known as the corporation.

B. The Eficienc?; of Trust
Social scientists have long argued that evolution can favor the development of a capacity for altruism in social organisms such as homo
sajuen r." This is because "irrationall\" cooperative behavior within a
particular group (including but not limited to trust and trustworthiness) often enhances the group's o~erallLvelfare. If the group does
~vell,members of the group on average also do well. Thus concern for
others-including concern for those ~vhotrust you-can
be highly
adaptive in species that rely on social interaction and exchange.
For similar reasons, cooperative behavior can be an important factor in the evolution notjust of social organisms but also of social inrtitufionr. This is because groups whose members cooperate with each
other can often thrive and grow at the expense of groups ~vhose
members do not cooperate." Social institutions that can promote and

In this Article, we focus on one particular social institution in
which we believe the role of trust behavior is both fundamental and
largely neglected in the legal literature. That institution is the business corporation. Corporate production typically requires the combined efforts and contributions of a \vide range of groups and individuals, including shareholders, employees, and managers. The nexus
of contracts theorv of the firm holds that these efforts and contributions are coordinated primarily through a web of express and implied
contractual agreements. At the same time, however, it is widely recognized that complex joint production in a business firm raises at
least two types of contracting problems. The first and perhaps more
familiar problem is the agency cost problem. The second problem,
which has attracted recent scholarly attention, is the team production
problem.
Consider first the agency cost problem. In the typical agency relationship, one person (the principal) wants to pay another (the agent)
to perform some task that the principal is unable or un\villing to perform for herself. But hiring an agent to do something for you immediately raises the question: How can you make sure your agent does a
good job? Economic and legal scholars have devoted tremendous ene r a over the years to investigating how legal rules, formal contracts,
con~pensationsystems, and market incentives can be used to motivate
ir)
agents to s e n e their principals' interests. T\vo fundamental points

'' Taken to its logical conclusion. this analysis suggests that nation-states and societies that encourage trust are likely to flourish relative to those that d o not. In this vein,
there is a n emcrging literature in social a n d political science o n the importance of "so,

associated with doing business in the corporate form. (Xfter all, corporations are fictional entities that must act, if at all, through human
agenw.) Second, no combination of legal rules and market forces can
bring agency costs in firms down to zero. Negotiating contracts,
monitoring agents, and enforcing legal righw in the courts are all
costly activities, and, in any case, such efforts usually cannot eliminate
all opportunities for an agent to shirk or steal. This is true to a greater
or lesser extent for every agent employed by the firm, from the chairman of the board dorvn to the janitor.
IYhile agency cost analysis focuses on the problem of getting
agents to act in their principals' interests, complex economic production can also give rise to a second type of economic problenl-the
team production problem."' Team production occurs when two or
more indi~idualsmust each contribute valuable resources to produce
a single, nonseparable output. If these inputs are complex or difficult
to monitor, it may be iinpossible for teain inembers to draft ex ante a
contract that specifies exactly \vho is to contribute ~vhat,in return for
rvhat payment. But if the team inembers wait until the project is completed to din? up the profits, how \vill they decide who is entitled to
rvhat share, when all parties had to contribute to earn the profits in
the first place? Such contracting difficulties can discourage investment in team production, especially when invested resources become
"team-specific," so that team inembers cannot ~valkaway froin the project rvithout losing some of the value of their in17estinent."

Corporate scholars generally recognize that teain production, \\it11
its attendant contracting problems, plays a central role in closely held
corporations in which a small nurnber of individuals participate both
as investors in and managers of the firm." We have recently argued
else~vherethat teain production may also be important in publicly
held firms." In particular, Jve argued that an essential econoinic function of the publicly held corporation may be to proride a vehicle
through rvhich shareholders, executives, rank-and-file employees, and
others rvho invest tearn-specific resources can, for their olvn benefit,
protect and promote such investrnents byjointly relinquishing control
over those resources and their joint enterprise to a third party-a
board of directors-charged with representing the team's interests
and with allocating re~vardsarnong tearn members. Although this ap44 .

that it provides a theoretical rationale for this indrpendence.

<-----Page 23----->also raises the obvious question of why a board largely insulated from
the direct command and control of either shareholders or other corporate stakeholders should do a good job for either."'
The bottom line is that, whether one focuses on agency costs or
team production problems, opportunistic behalior of one kind or another is an unavoidable problem associated lvith doing business in the
corporate form. Indeed, it is the paramount problem and the focus of
the vast bulk of the rnodern literature on corporate law and policy.
Thus the stage is set for understanding the importance of trust.
V'here trust can be harnessed, it can substantially reduce the inefficiencies associated r\ith both agency and team production relationships. Trust permits transactions to go fomyard on the basis of a handshake rather than a cornplex formal contract; it reduces the need to
expend resources on constant monitoring of employees and business
partners; and it avoids the uncertainty and expense associated ~ i i t h
tning to enforce formal and informal agreements in the courts. Trust
behavior also reduces losses frorn others' undetectable or unpunishable opportunistic behavior, losses that could discourage the forrnation of valuable agency and team production relationships in the first
place.
Business organizations that promote trust in relationships among
investors, managers, and employees accordingly can reduce and, in
some cases, avoid many of the costs associated with policing against
opportunism-costs that other firms must bear. The corollan is that
firms that successfully encourage trust among their participants on
relevant tasks can enjoy an evolutionan advantage over firms that do

I ' Thus while the institution of a corporate hierar-chy topped b! the board ma! addresr one economic prohlern (team pr-oduction). it ma! exacerbate another (agency
costs). L-rider the teal11 production approach. directors are conceived not as rhareholderr' agents. but as agents for the entire corpor-ate tearn. Thir tearn consists of ,111
who make firm-specific investments and expect a share of the resulting output. including not just shareholders but also manager-s, emplo!ees, and possibly other gr-oups as

I' SIl~chof the corporate law literature. not to mention the a\-er-agecorporate law
casebook, tocures o n how opportunistic behavior within the firrn car1 he dircouraged
through derivati~esuits, incentive compensatio~lcontracts, shareholder pr-oposals,
shareholder and director voting rules, a n active rnarket for corporate take()\-err,and ro

rnarket mechanisms thought to constrairl and direct b e h a ~ i o r~vithinthe fir111 has its
own costs and limitatio~lr..4r a result. external incentiies cannot completely elinlirlate
the costs associated lrith oppor-tu~listic
behavior- within firms.

<-----Page 24----->not." Economic analysis itself suggests that a corporate capacity to
promote trust behavior may often be not just important to business
success but essential."
This is something that management theorists, consultants, and
businesspeople themselves have always known. There is an extensive
literature both in the popular and business press and in management
theory that stresses the importance of establishing, building, and supporting trust among corporate participants.'" As the book jacket of
one recently published book in the trade press puts it: "Trust is the
glue that holds organizations together. More polverful than contracts
or authority, trust enables partner companies-or groups within a
company-to achieve results that exceed the sum of the parts.""' Nevertheless, legal scholarship largely neglects the role of trust in firms,
assuming instead that the best-indeed, only-way of controlling opportunistic behalior is through legal and market incentives that discourage the shirking and stealing that is to be expected of rationally
selfish individuals.
Mly is this so? '4s noted earlier, part of the reason may lie in the
fact that trust beha\ior in business firms often appears, on first inspection, to be consistent ~vith(if not fully explained by) observed external
incentives, making it easy to jump to the conclusion that those incentives rausp trusting and trustworthy behavior." Law professors may be

emphasizes the case method, and case law inevitably focuses on situations in which trust has broken down and the parties are seeking to
invoke the weight of the law to control behavior.
But it seems likely that the contemporary dominance of the law
and economics approach to corporate law, with its implicit reliance on
the homo ero~~onzicus
model of human behavior, has also worked to
blind corporate theorists to the importance of trust. Economic analysis has made a number of important contributions to the legal culture's understanding of corporate lalv, not the least of rvhich has been
its emphasis on rigorous and exacting analysis. At the same time, the
resulting tendency to focus only on behakior that can be easily captured in formal mathematical models may have contributed to many
modern corporate theorists' reluctance to abandon the idea of rational selfishness in favor of such an apparently soft and "mushy" concept as trust.
\.Ye believe, however, that it is possible to develop a formal conception of trust that allolvs us (1) to understand lvhen and how it
cornes into play, (2) to identifi lvhat factors and variables determine
its incidence, and (3) to rnake and test predictions about behabior.
To demonstrate, we re~iewbelow an especially coinpelling and useful
form of evidence of when and why trust occurs-experimental studies
of human behalior in social dilemmas.

Social scientists use the term "social dilemma" to describe situations in which groups of indi~idualsfind themselves facing incentives
identical to those presented in the familiar prisoner's dilemma of
game theon. In a classic prisoner's dilemma, t\vo players are asked to
choose between either "cooperating" r\ith their partner or "defecting." Payoffs are structured so that, whatever her partner does, a
player can always receive a higher payoff by defecting than by cooperating. 17etif both players defect, they each receive less than if both
cooperated. In other words, although the best group outcome requires cooperation, the best strateE for each individual is always to
defect. The net result is that the pursuit of self-interest inexorably

demonstrating the pe~~asiveness

<-----Page 26----->diminishes the players' mutual welfare."
Consider a common example of a social dilemma, the "group contribution game." X group of n players is assembled and each player
given a sum of money (say, $10) as an initial "stake." The players are
told that they can either keep the cash or contribute it to a common
investment pool. They are also told that any money contributed to
the common pool will be multiplied by some factor greater than 1 but
less than n and distributed equally among all the players in the group,
including those who chose not to contribute. Thus the best individual
strategy in the game is to keep the $10 (while taking a pro rata portion of anything that ends up in the common investment pool). The
best group outcome, hoil~ever,requires universal contribution.
Social dilemma experiments offer important insights into trust.
This is because the structure of a social dilemma drives selfish players
always to defect. Trust, however, can provide a motivation for players
in a social dilemma to choose the optimal, cooperative outcome over
the individually rational but suboptimal solution. In other words,
trust can solve the dilemma.
Suppose four players trapped in a social dilemma each believe
that their felloiv players are intrinsically trust~vorthy. In such a situation, the players could achieve the optimal outcome by choosing to
trust each other (to make themselves vulnerable by selecting a cooperative strategy, in the expectation that their fellows also will cooperate) and, in the same act, choosing to be trusn\.orthy (to refrain from
exploiting their fellows' vulnerability, even though defecting would
produce a higher individual payoff). Although this may seem an obvious solution, it is important to emphasize that rational and purely
selfish players would never actually cooperate in this manner. Athough they might agree to cooperate, defection remains the dominant strategy, and all would renege on their agreement.
Rational selfishness therefore precludes trust. Yet, over the past
forty years, social scientists have published the results of literally hundreds of experiments in which indiliduals were placed in situations in
which they faced payoff structures resembling those in the group coniY
tribution game. These experimental studies demonstrate beyond

For example, suppose that each player is told that she \\ill receive $6 if she defects and her partner cooperates, $4 if both cooperate. $2 if both defect, or $0 if she
cooperates but her partner defects. In such a case. each player maximizes her individual returns bj- defecting. Ho~vever,mutual defectiorl produces a total payoff of only $4
(52 each). Mutual cooperation \vould produce a total payoff of $8 ($4 each).

question that trust exists. Homo sapiens in a social dilemma-unlike
homo economicu~sho~vs
a rnarked and predictable tendency toward
"irrationally" cooperative behavior in general and toward trust behavior in particular.
We explore below some of the factors and variables that have
proven empirically important in determining the incidence of trust in
social dilemma games. As will be seen, this evidence supports five
findings. First, trust is an empirical reality; individuals in social dilemma experiments exhibit far Inore cooperative behavior than can
possibly be explained by external incentives. Second, different individuals manifest different levels of willingness to cooperate in social
dilemma experiments. Third, these individual variations to some degree reflect differences in individuals' past experiences, suggesting
that trust may be a learned behavior. Fourth, trust is also a socially contingent behavior. In other words, trust appears to depend significantly
on individuals' perceptions of others' expectations, likely behaviors,
and social relationships to themselves; in some social situations people
predictably display trust, while in others they predictably do not. Finally, however, econornic payoffs are not irrelevant. Although people
cooperate in social dilemmas even when they must incur a personal
cost, the levels of cooperation observed begin to decline as the cost of
cooperating increases.
Taken as a whole, the experimental evidence on hurnan behavior
in social dilemmas consequently provides a portrait of humanity that
differs markedly from the picture painted by the homo economicus
model. In particular, people appear to shift readily between at least
nvo preference functions or modes of behavior, depending on the social context. Put differently, the typical individual manifests at bast two
distinct personalities. One might be described as a "competitive" or
"self-regarding" personality. M l e n the competitive personality is
dominant, an individual ill choose options that maximize her perscience, in BEYOSDSELF-ISTEREST,

A. The Realitj of Trust
As noted earlier, one reason why modern corporate scholarship
tends to overlook the role of trust in encouraging cooperative behavior may be that the cooperation we obseme in firms is often consistent
-> 4
both with internalized trust and with external incentives. One of the
most valuable attributes of social dilemma experiments is their ability
to untangle such external and internal motivations for cooperative
behavior. Similarly, one of the most important and intriguing findings of such experiments is that the incidence of cooperation in social
dilemma games is far higher than can possibly be explained by external incentives alone. Consider the case of the social dilemma game
played by strangers who never expect to see each other again and ~ v h o
are told that the game will be played only once. Defection is the only
sensible strateg? for the rationally selfish player in such a "one-shot"
game. Yet cooperation rates in one-shot social dilemirla games approximate fifty percent. "
Further e ~ i d e n c eof the existence of trust emerges from comparing cooperation rates in one-shot garnes with cooperation rates in
games in which players are told that they will pla) repeatedly. If behalior that looks like "trust" is actually driven by the fear of retaliation
or loss of reputation-as most economists presume-then when cooperation occurs at all it should occur only in repeat-game situatioils
in which one player's cooperation can be re~\.ardedby her partner's
future cooperation (and, conversely, defection punished by future defection) ."' The h o r n ~economicus model accordingly predicts that repeat

<-----Page 29----->games should have higher cooperation rates than one-shot games. Yet
the experimental studies show the opposite result; cooperation rates are
lower in reiterated play than in one-shot games5' Later we will consider an explanation for this finding. For the moment, we simply note
that it is clearly inconsistent with the assumption that people behave
only in a calculative, self-interested way.
Perhaps the most thorough investigation of the ineffectiveness of
calculative selfishness in predicting cooperative behavior may be
found in an analysis of the accumulated results of thirty-five years of
social dilemma experiments prepared by David ally.^^ Sally developed a data set of 130 social dilemma experiments and categorized
each according to a variety of experimental variables (one-shot versus
repeated games, two-person versus multiperson games, and so forth).
He then performed a regression analysis that compared the cooperation rates observed in the different experiments with identified experimental variables. He found that the variables one would expect to
matter most for calculative trust (for example, reiterated games ought
to have higher cooperation rates than one-shot games, and reiterated
games with relatively small numbers of players ought to have higher
rates still) either had little effect on cooperation rates or effects o@osite to those predicted by neoclassical the01-y.~~
meaningful incentive for cooperation in repeat games, especially when the games are
played by more than two people. In such situatioils it can be difficult for players to
identifj the individuals who have defected. And even when this can be done, it is impossible to "punish" the defector without also punishing others in the group who have
cooperated. Dawes & Thaler, supra note 3, at 191; see alsoYamagishi, supra note 53, at
75 (noting that cooperation often coiltinues in reiterated games even when penalized).
Cooperation is also hard to explain under the rleoclassical model when the players
kno\v that play will end after a certain number of rounds, giving rise to the "end-game"
scenario. Game theory predicts that in the known last round of play, both players
should defect because there is no prospect of cooperation being rewarded in the future. Knowing that defection is certain in the last trial, both players will also defect in
the penultimate trial, and so on by backward induction, until defection becomes the
dominant strategy for both players in all trials. See Dawes & Thaler, s~ipranote 3, at
191; Sally, rz~pranote 53, at 65.
57
See Dawes & Thaler, supra note 3, at 188-89 (finding that single-trial games,
which accounted for about one-third of the sample, actually had higher cooperation
rates than repeated games).
58
See Sally, supra note 53, at 58.

For example, the size of the experimental group appeared to have little influence on the incidence of cooperation, while (as noted above) cooperation rates actually were lower in reiterated games than one-shot plays. Ser id. at 77. The notable exception was the size of the benefits from defection. In accord with neoclassical theory,
subjects were more likely to defect when the monetary benefits from defection were
greater. See al,so infra note 100 and accompanying text (discussing how trust with large

<-----Page 30----->In contrast, cooperation rates seemed highly sensitive to variables
that should be irrelevant to the rationally selfish player. For example,
cooperation was far Inore likely when the experimenter instructed the
players to cooperate. This is inconsistent with rational selfishness, as
mere instructions do not change either the players' payoffs or the
ti0
dominance of defection as the optimal individual strategy. Similarly,
players were much more likely to cooperate in experiments in which
they were allowed to exchange promises to contribute. Again, this is a
striking result. Absent legal sanction or some threat of retaliation,
there is no reason in economic theory why such promises should be
either believed or kept."
Social dilemma studies accordingly provide ovenvhelming evidence that a behavioral model of trust that relies solely on calculative
self-interest is likely to miss much if not most of the phenomenon it
attempts to describe. There is more-much more-going on here.

To develop a better understanding of the cooperative b e h a ~ i o r
observed in social dilemmas, it is worthwhile to explore a second consistent finding of such experiments: Different indi~idualsplaying a
social dilemma game appear to bring to the table differing predisposib2
tions to trust and to behave trusnvorthily.
One notorious example of this phenomenon can be seen in experiments that have found that economics students are significantly
less likely than others to cooperate in social dilemma experiments.
One frequently cited study b) Gerald Mame11 and Ruth ;lmes, for example, found that cooperation rates in a social dilemma game generally averaged bemeen forty percent and sixty percent. The notable
exception was the series of games played by economics graduate students." In those games, the cooperation rate was only twenh. perstakes can develop in repeated games in which parties start with small stakes).

This result illustrates a more widespread phenomenon-that individuals appear to differ significantly in their willingness to trust others.
Some people are "high trusters" who behave as if the) generall) expect others to behave trustworthily (for example, to tell the truth, refrain from stealing, keep their promises, and contribute to public
goods). Others are "low trusters" lvho expect people to behave opportunistically (for example, to lie, steal, break promises, and free-ride).
These differing expectations show up reliably in responses to questionnaires designed to measure trust, such as the Rotter Interpersonal

erate in social dilemmas. This pattern is often explained as one of
projection. People M-hoare untrustworthy expect others to be like
themselves (that is, untrustworthy) and behave accordingly. Similarly,
people who are trusnvorthy assume others also are trustworthy and,
therefore, safe to trust."

C. Trust as a Learned Behauior
The notion that some people are more likely than others to displa) trust and trustworthiness naturally raises the question: M'hat
causes these differences? It is possible that differences in trust behavior may be to some extent inherited. This would suggest, for example,
that economics students tend to defect in social dilemmas because lobtrusters for some reason are attracted to the study of economics. X
second possibility, however, is that economics students score low on
trust in social dilemmas because studying economics teaches them to
be distrustful." There is substantial evidence to suggest that individi0

D. The I?lJluence of k S o c ~Context
/
It is important to note that the claim that trust is a learned behavior does not imply that high trusters always favor cooperation over
competition in new situations. To the contran, a fourth key empirical
finding from the social dilemma studies is that even high trusters, in
the right circumstances, predictab1.i choose to defect rather than cooperate. The key appears to be whether, when faced rjith a new situation that presents social dilemma pa~offs,an individual categorizes it
as a corrzpetit~7~e
task or a coof1nntz7~etask. If the task is viewed as competitive, both high and lob trusters pursue self-interest and defect. If
the task is categorized as cooperative, high trusters in particular bill
choose a cooperative
strategv that appears to reflect concern for oth-ers' welfare.''
M l a t determines whether a social dilemma situation is perceived
as cooperative or competitive? One critical variable appears to be social context-plalers' perceptions of what others expect and need, how
others are likel) to behave, and what others' relationships are to themselves. The importance of social context can perhaps be seen most
clear11 from David Sally's comprehensive suney of the results of Inore
than one hundred social dilemma experiments. Sa1l.i found that coopeiation iates in these studies ranged from as low as five to more
.tthan ninety-five percent.

1vas the only dominant strateg) for the rationally selfish player.) Further, Sally concluded that a variety of purely social factors appeared
highly influential in deteri~liningthe degree of cooperation observed
in social dilemma games. For example, players 1vere more likely to
cooperate 1$711e11they believed that their contribution was important to
the group's welfare: As the size of the loss to the group from an individual's defection increased, the likelihood of defection decreased."'
(An interesting ii~lplicationis that the more vulnerable one becomes,
the greater the likelihood that a trusted person ill in fact prove
trus~vorthy."') Visual contact was another variable that significantly
increased cooperation rates, even though allo~\ingplayers to view
each other does not change the payoffs in a social dilemma."
These types of social variables-perceptions of others' dependence and personal contacts-are the sorts of variables that business
institutions can and do take account of and even deliberately manipulate. It is not unusual to find employers telling employees hen, valuable their contributions are or organizing meetings and social events
to give them opportunities to interact. In this ,Irticle, however, we
wish to draw attention to how the behavioral phenomenon of trust
can change our understanding not only of the nature and f~lnctioning
of corporations, but also of the nature and functioning of corporate
law. In this vein, we explore in greater detail below three particular
social variables that the empirical studies suggest strongly influence
trust behavior. These are: (1) i~lstructionsfrom authority, (2) perceptions of group membership, and (3) expectations regarding others' trust behavior.

1. Instructions from Authority
One of the most consistent findings in the social dilemma literature is that pla\ers are far more likel~to cooperate wit11 each other if
the experimenter simp11 asks them to do so. Salh's s u n e ) , for exam7')

raised base cooperation rates by as much as forty percentage points.
Correspondingly, formal instructions to compete decreased cooperation rates by as much as thirty-three percentage points."
This result is unlikely to surprise either a psychologist or the average person on the street. It might, however, belvilder an economist;
lvhether the experimenter tells the players to cooperate or defect has
no effect on the econo?nic payoffs in the game. Nevertheless, formal
ii1structioi1s exert a strong influence on the likelihood of cooperation.
People seem inclined to do ~vhatthey are told to do, especially lvhen
instructions come from someone lvho is perceived as something of an
authority.
This effect is so strong that significant changes in behavior occur
when the experimenter even hints at her desires. For example, in one
social dilemma study by Lee Ross and Xndrerv TZ'ard, players lvere divided into two groups. The first group lvas told that they were going
to play "The Comm~unityGame." The second group lras told that they
\$,ere going to play "The TZ'all Street Game." Llltl~ough
both groups
\$,ere presented with identical payoff structures, the different labels
produced dramatic differences in beha\ior. Only about one-third of
the players chose to cooperate in pla~ing"The Wall Street Game." 111
contrast, more than two-thirds cooperated when pla!ing "The (:ommunity ~ a m e . " ~ '

2. Perceptions of Group Identity

X second social variable that consistently has been found to exert
a strong influence on cooperation rates in social dilemmas is group
identity. Social scientists have long argued that group identity is an
important component of most individuals' psychological makeup and
that in situations in lvhich group identity is brought into play, individuals appear to adopt preference functions that consider the

players tvho had been told that their contribution would benefit their
ingroup. I11 contrast, communication slightly decreased cooperation
(down to thirty-one percent) among players who had been told that
their contribution rvould benefit their outgroup, although this effect
40
was not statistically significant.
Such results demonstrate both that a sense of group identity can
easily be fostered and that it can be extremely important to the decision to categorize a particular social relationship as either cooperative
or competitive. Although significant cooperation can occur without
overt efforts to create a group identity, enhancing feelings of group
identity predictably leads to increases in the levels of o b s e ~ e dcooperation.'" People are more willing to sacrifice self-interest for "us"
than for "them."

3. Expectations About Others' Beha\ior
Finally, a third social variable that appears to influence indiliduals' willingness to exhibit trust beha~ior is their perceptions of
n,hether others are likely to exhibit trust. Studies have found that
players are much more likely to cooperate in a social dilemma when
they expect their fellow players to cooperate." Similar e~idencemay
be observed in the consistent finding that players are more likely to
cooperate with each other rvhe11 they are allowed a short time period
in which to communicate with each other. But they are particularly
likely to cooperate when their communication takes the form of exchanged statements of intent to cooperate.'?

M'hy does the expectation that others will cooperate increase the
incidence of cooperative behavior in social dilemmas? One possibility
is that the belief that others ~$111cooperate increases perceptions of
ingroup membership."' X second theory is that players in a social dilemma are motivated much less by the hope that they might extract
gains at their fellow players' expense than by the fear that their fellows
might succes~f~~lly
exploit them. I11 other words, people nant to avoid
"being a sucker."" Yet a third possibilitv is that players look to others'

these games show a marked tendency to conform to the expected behavior of other players." I \ l e n in Rome, most do as they expect the
Romans to do.

E. Thr InJuence of Eronornic Contrxt
In emphasizing the starring role social factors play in determining
the incidence of trust, we do not mean to imply that economic factors
are unimportant. Homo sakiens is a far more other-regarding species
than homo economicus. But there is reason to believe that most people
keep at least one eye on personal payoffs when deciding whether to

Studies have found that, while people do cooperate in social dilemma games, as the personal cost associated with cooperating rises
(that is, as players' expected gains from defection increase), cooperation rates begin to decline. For example, Sally's regression anal~sis
found that doubling the reward from defecting decreased average cooperation rates by as much as sixteen percentage points.'"n
other
words, people's willingness to trust appears to be mild11 "downwardsloping." As the personal cost of trust in a social dilenlma rises, cooperation rates decline. This observation raises the question: If trust
behavior is only likely to occur when it is not too costly to behave
trustworthily, how can trust be a source of significant social gains?
The answer to this question is twofold. First, the costs and benefits of trust beha~iordo not march in lockstep. Acts of trust that require onh a modest sacrifice on the part of the trusted actor can produce much larger gains for the trusting actor. For example, a
marginal increase in the degree of care exercised by a colporate director or employee ma, greatly benefit a firm if it prevents the loss or
destruction of valuable corporate assets. Similarly, it is easI to imagine
sitiiations in which an agent who steals from a firm (say, by selling a
trade secret) inflicts harm far greater than any benefit she receives.
The experimental evidence indicates that it is in exactly these sorts of
circumstances-when the indi~idualcost of cooperation is relatively
small and the benefits for others relatively large-that people are most
like11 to cooperate in a social dilemma.q" Thus, trust beha~iorseems
particular11 likely to occur (and to lead to clear social gains) in situations in which a corporate participant's trustworth, beha~iorwould
create disproportionate gain or in which that participant's rnalfeasance would inflict disproportionate harm.
Second, studies have shown that while players in one-shot social
dilemmas are less likel~to cooperate when pla~ingfor large stakes
(that is, when personal gains from defecting are large), pla~ersin repeated games can be induced to trust each other in such situations.
This is done by starting with small stakes and increasing the stakes in
later roui~ds.'~l~l

and increasing mutual vulnerability is often observed in the business

The net result is that, even if the "supply fiinction" for trust is
downward-sloping, there is probably a \vide variety of business circumstances in which trust beha~iorproduces significant benefits. And
even small acts of trust, when aggregated over manr pla~ersand many
transactions, can add up to ven big gains. But the experimental e\idence cautions against asking trust to bear too much weight in anr individual case. M%en the price of honor gets too high, people refuse

Caveatr and Conclusions

Economists and legal scholars rvho favor economic analysis traditionally view human beha~iorin terms of a simple model of rational
selfishness constrained on11 by legal and market forces. Although this
model has great explanatory power in many situations, it overlooks a
third, less well understood but equally potent force for modi4ing
human behavior: social11 contingent other-regarding preferences, including, but not limited to, trust."" Extensive experimental evidence
demonstrates that most people behave as if they have two personalities
or preference functions. In some contexts, individuals behave as if
they were pure11 selfish. But when the social and economic conditions are right, their cooperative, other-regarding personalities

<-----Page 42----->emerge.
This last point bears emphasizing, for it hints at the potential fragilitv of trust.
noted earlier, one of the critical determinants of cooperative behavior in social dilemma games is what the players expect
the other players in the game to do. Xs a result, repeated social dilemma games tend to converge quickl, on one of tmTopossible equilibrium outcomes: Either most players cooperate, or most defect. The
natural implication is that even a small change in initial conditionsperhaps a change in the proportion of lorv- to high-trusters in a social
dilemma situation, in feelings of group identitv, or even in the language used to describe a particular social or legal relationship--can
shift the situation past a "tipping point," moving the end result from
one beha~ioralextreme to the other.
The potential fragility of trust is heightened by the possibility that
the social conditions that favor trust are easier to destroy than to create. Express and implied signals of trust and trustm~orthinessare subject to being disproved by contrary e~idence-say, when a p l a ~ e rin a
social dilemma game tricks her fellow players into cooperating b1 announcing her own intent to cooperate and then exploits their trust b~
defecting. In contrast, signs of lack of trust and trustworthiness tend
to be self-fillfilling. Once players in a social dilemma game come to
believe that their fellorvs intend to defect, they themselves defect, and
distrust prevails even if it was initially unjustified. In other words, the
impact of social signals, including choice of rhetoric, ma1 be aslmmetric. Rhetoric alone cannot support trust, but rhetoric alone can
undermine it.'"'
In sum, there is reason to believe that trust can on11 blossom in favorable social conditions. hloreover, even when people initialh trust,
if their cooperation is not reciprocated-if other pla~erschoose instead to defect-the1 will quicklv switch to a competitive strategy.
Trust, it turns out, is neither gullibilih nor pure selflessness. \2"ne11
abused, trust tends to disappear. But when it is not abused, trust permits patterns of reciprocal, other-regarding beha~iorto spring up that
are impossible to explain under neoclassical assumptions of selfish rationalin . hloreover, as social dilemma experiments illustrate, this be101

superior-on both a group and an individual basis-to the outcomes
that can be achieved through rational selfishness. Although trust ma,
not be strict11 "rational," it can be efficient. That obsenation in turn
suggests that, in man, situations, the most effective way to constrain
welfare-reducing, opportunistic behavior ma, not be by changing individuals' external rervards and punishments, but instead b~ changing
their internal pfeferences and encouraging the emergence of their cooperative, other-regarding "personality."
The notion of endogenous preferences that can be changed by
manipulating social context provides a dramatic departure from standard economic ana1)sis."" But it can also provide significant insight
into actual human institutions. To illustrate, we consider in Part 111
how several important and othenvise puzzling features of corporate
law can be explained through an analysis that takes account of trust
and the w a ~actual people behave in actual situations. Before applying the lessons of social dilemma experiments to our understanding
of corporate law, however, we note the potential pitfalls of relying on
such experiments to predict human behavior in the far more complex
environment of the corporation.
Social dilemma games are, by their ven nature, poor imitations of
the complexities of life in the everyda) business world."" Yet, the information provided by such experiments is only useful if we are willing
to take the next step and assume that the sorts of variables that determine cooperation rates in experiments also influence cooperation between and among corporate officers, emplo)ees, directors, and shareholders. In doing this we inevitably run the risks associated with
extrapolation.
10.5

O n first inspection, the notion of endogeneo~lspreferences appears to pose a
challenge to economic analysis by raising the follo~vingquestion: If efficiency lies in
satisfying as many human desires as possible but if human desires change in response
to social circumstances, 11o.r~are we to know what is "efficient?" h cornplete anslver to
this question lies beyond the scope of this Article. For a n excellent discussion, see

that while in many cases there are n o obvious efficiency advantages to be derived from
changing people's preferences (for example, from vanilla to strar\.bern ice cream), in
other cases there are. For example, we improve social ~velfareif .rye induce individuals
.rvith sadistic preferences to adopt instead altruistic preferences. (Because sadists are
satisfied by inflicting pain on others while altruists are satisfied bv increasing others'
happiness. shifting from sadism to altruism increases overall hurnan happiness, other
thin s being equal).

SeeDa~res,supra note 86, a t 188 (obseming that social dilernrna games "are lousy

<-----Page 44----->Some of these risks likely are not too serious. For example, because the participants in social dilemma experiments are often undergraduate and graduate students, it might be argued that their behavior is not representative of other segments of the population.
However, we suspect that it is representative enough of behavior in
most ~ o r ~ o r a t i o n s . 'After

More broadly, our approach to the social dilemma evidence is for

about trust, we simply compare the variables that go into the box ~vith

Unfortunately, the question of what motivates trust remains a subject
of hot debate among social scientists, though some things seem more

the result of mental mistake or cognitive error. Researchers in most
experiments have gone to some length to ensure that the players fully
understand the payoff functions with which they are presented."' The
obvious alternative is that trust behavior represents a forrn of socially
contingent altruism in which people take account of others' ~velfarein

Further work on these and related questions would be immensely
valuable. In the meantime, .ive must content ourselves with a behaviorist approach. The result is undoubtedly a cartoonish, twodimensional sketch of the complex reality of human behavior. Even
this two-dimensional model, however, gives us a better understanding
of corporations and corporate la~vthan the one-dimensional model of
homo eronomzcus.

The conventional nexus of contracts approach to corporate law
attempts to explain how firms work, and the role of law in making
them work, solely in terms of market incentives and legal obligations.
For the reasons we outlined in Part I, however, these explanations
have not been fully satisfactory. Legal sanctions and market forces often cannot bind corporate participants tightly enough to restrain all
opportunistic beha~ior(at least if one assumes that participants are
rational and self-interested players). The information requirements
are just too high and the business environment is too complex,
opaque, and uncertain.
i
h a result, there is reason to believe that trust may play an important role in the success of many business firms. That possibility is of
obvious interest to businesspeople as well as to management theorists
and business consultants who study what makes successful firms tick.
But an understanding of the role of trust in business relationships and
the variables that influence trust is also important for lawmakers, legal
scholars, and practicing lawyers.
We consider below how the behavioral phenomenon of trust can
offer vital insights into a variety of debates and puzzles in contemporary corporate law. We begin by revisiting one of the longest-running
engagements in contemporary corporate scholarship-the battle beaveen the "contractarians" and the "anticontractarians" over the nature of corporate fiduciary duties.
A. Trust Beha-i~ior,the Duty of Lojaltj, and the Contractarian- 

Anticontractam'an Debate 


Corporate case law frequently centers on the fiduciary duties of

<-----Page 47----->loyalty and care that corporate directors and officers are said to owe
the firm and its shareholders, or on the fiducian duties shareholders
are said to owe to each other."' Indeed, fiduciar). relationships lie at
the heart of modern corporate law. Yet what does it mean "to owe a
fiduciary duty?"
According to the contractarian school of corporate scholars, the
answer to this question is "not much." Contractarian commentators
(including such noted theorists as Henry Butler, Frank Easterbrook,
Daniel Fischel, Jonathan Macey, Geoffrey Miller, and L,arr). Ribstein)
argue that corporate law is best understood as a kind of standard form
contract for governing relationships among officers, directors, and
Ili
shareholders. A corollary of this iiew is that the contracting parties
should be free to depart from the terms of the standard form whenever they so desire. In particular, the contractarians argue that the
rules of fiduciary duty are and should be viewed as nothing more than
default rules that corporate participants can "opt out" of upon mutual
agreement.""
This claim is hotly disputed by an opposing group of equally
prominent scholars that includes Victor Brudnev, Robert Clark, Deborah DeMott, Melvin Eisenberg, and Tan~arranke el."' According to

Unlike fiduciarv relationships, conventional contracts start from the
assumption that the contracting parties are purelv self-interested
actors whose behavior must be channeled by external constraints.
Thus the archetypal contract emerges from arm's-length bargaining
between two parties who each seek to serve onlv their 01\11 ends and
promote only their ovn welfare. Moreover, each partv is free to
decline to perform and pay damages instead if breach serves her selfinterest. Describing a relationship as a contract both assumes nlzd

in describing the fiduciarv relationship between corporate officers
and directors on the one side, and the firm and its shareholders on
the other, as a subspecies of contract, an "agency" arrangement in
which one party is paid to do another's bidding."" Because this ap-

Many fiduciar? relationships might still be described as "contractual" in the
broad sense that both the fiduciary and the b e n e f i c i a ~enter the relationship voluntarily. It should be noted, ho~veier,that fiducia1-y obligations also can arise by operation

principal's preferences: The principal can protect her interests through her control of

<-----Page 51----->proach obscures the essence of the fiducian obligation, it is not surprising that, as Dean Clark has pointed out, contractarian theorists
"have done little to explain the concept of the fiduciary [or] to develop positive theories as to why fiduciary law has developed its particular doctrines and characteristics."'"" After all, if one assumes that
the contracting parties are purely selfish, tqing to control opportunistic behavior by asking individuals to adopt an other-regarding preference function makes about as much sense as trying to change the dietam habits of wolves by telling them to like vegetables instead of meat.
Contractarian analysis, like neoclassical economics, treats preferences
as fixed and exogenous. How can someone choose to alter her own
preferences?
Yet the empirical evidence on trust reviewed in Part I1 demonstrates that people behave as if they do change preferences-and they
do so on a regular and predictable basis. This evidence may offer
valuable guidance to scholars and lawmakers seeking to understand
better the nature of the fiduciary duties courts impose on corporate
officers, directors, and shareholders.'"
The phenomenon of trust behavior suggests that fiducian relationships are created by the law in situations in which it is efficient or
othei~visedesirable to promote other-regarding, trusting and trustworthy behavior. Moreover, the key to a successful fiduciary relationship lies in framing both economic and social conditions so as to encourage the fiduciary to make a psychological commitment to further
her beneficiary's welfare rather than her own."' For example, by making directors and officers who ~iolatetheir dutv of loyalq to the firm
liable for damages, the la141 encourages trustworthy behavior in corporate fiduciaries by reducing the expected gains from malfeasance

(describing the fiduciav obligation as "one of the most elusive concepts in r\ngloAmerican lalv," one that "eludes theoretical capture").
142
It may be important for the law, where possible, to rninirnize external incentives
inconsistent with that psychological commitment. Srr, r.g., \zipra text accompanying
note 122 (describing the rule against private profits).
i

<-----Page 52----->(thus reducing the fiduciary's cost of beha~ingtrustworthily) ."" At the
same time, case la141 on the duty of loyalty unambiguously signals that
the fiduciary relationship is a social situation that calls for otherregarding behavior, to the point where the fiduciary is discouraged

rule that bans unauthorized personal gains even in circumstances in
which the fiducian could arrange this 'itithout harm to her benefici134
Similarly, the sermonizing tone typically adopted by courts in

fiduciary cases reinforces the social message that other-regarding behavior is demanded.
A beha~ioralanalysis of the fiduciary relationship accordingly
supports the anticontractarian view that it is fundamentally misleading-even dangerous-to apply the rhetoric of contract to fiducian
duties. Such an analysis also lends credence to the anticontractarian
claim that corporate officers and directors ought not to be allowed to
opt out of their fiducian duties through bylaws, charter provisions, or
emplo!ment agreements.
The contractarian argument for opting out is simple; if participants in a corporation perceive it as in their mutual interest to opt out
of the rules of fiduciary duty, why not let them? M"ni1e this argument
is straightfonrard, anticontractarians point out that it overlooks an
important possibility-that allowing participants in one firm to opt
out of fiduciary duties may harm participants in o t h ~ rfirms by introducing what might be called an "informational externality.""' In par-

This approach may seem on first inspection consistent ~viththe homo rcot,onuc.us

In effect, the fiducia~?is simply put hack in the position she rvas in before 5he violated

Second, discouraging fiduciaries from looking out for their ouln interests does not necessarily give them an incentive to d o a good job looking out for someone else's. Ho~vever, once Tie allorv for the possibility of trust beha\-ior, the duty of loyalty makes sense

<-----Page 53----->ticular, allorting corporate officers and directors to opt out of fiduciar)- duties introduces ambiguity about whether someone who is called
"officer" or "director" can be safely assumed to have made a commitment to put the firm's interests ahead of her orvn. This uncertainty
requires individuals who want to participate in a business relationship
to expend time, effort, and resources to determine whether their fiduciaries are really fiduciaries. For example, a potential investor interested in a particular company might have to obtain and read that
firm's charter, bylartrs, and emplojment contracts in order to research
rvhether or not the company's officers and directors bore fiduciary dul
ties. Because increasing investors' research costs reduces their willingness to pay for shares, allowing officers and directors to opt out of
the duty of loyaly in one firm imposes external costs on othpr firms by
diluting the informational content of the "officer" and "director" laI i;
bels.
Strict contractarians might answer that such external costs may be
negligible if' the cost of investors' informing themselves about opt-out
provisions is small. Alternatively, even if external costs are large, they
might be worth bearing if opting out adds value in a significant number of cases. But behavioral analysis suggests that the costs of allouing
opting out are likely to be large indeed, and the benefits quite small.

This is not to suggest that it is never advantageous to structure

L\'hile it is often stated that corporate directors and officers ~villbe liable
for negligence in carrying o u t their corporate duties, all seem agreed
that such a statement is misleading. . . . [Lliability is rarely imposed
upon corporate directors o r officers simply for bad judgment and this reluctance to im oae liability. . . has been doctrinall! labeled the business
?,6
judgment rule.
'

Case law describes the business judgment rule as "'a presumption
that. . . the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in
good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the
best interests of the compan~.""" The elements of "good faith" and
an "honest belief' that one is sening the company's best interests are
usually undisputed in cases that do not raise the sort of conflicts of interest typically analyzed under the dut) of lo7alt).14' Thus, whether or
not the business judgment rule applies will usually turn on whether a
board's act was "informed."
In the watershed case of Smith v. k n Gorkom, the Delaware Supreme Court declared that directors will be deemed uninformedand so outside the protection of the business judgment rule-only
when the plaintiff can demonstrate that they were p s s l t . negligent in
failing to inform themselves, before acting, "'of all material
information reasonably available to them.""4" The net effect of this
rule is to insulate directors from liabilit) whenever the? make even a
modest attempt to follow the appropriate formalities for reaching a
decision. Provided proper procedures are followed, the business
judgement rule precludes any further judicial inquiry into the
substantive wisdom of the decision.
Even in the rare case in which directors might be found to have
employed grossly defective procedures, other barriers stand between
them and personal exposure to liabilih. For example, since the enactment of section 102(b)(7) of Delaware's General Corporation La\.,

charter provisions that expressly eliminate director liability for monetar) damages for breach of the duty of care.Ii0 When section
102(b)(7) does not a p p l ~ the
, rules of derivative suit procedure may
require a would-be shareholder plaintiff to allege (before any discovlil

meet this burden and be allowed to proceed, Delaware law permits
the directors to create an "independent committee" that may be able
to terminate his suit.'"' Finally, even if the directors are ultimate17

The net result is that, as a practical matter, a negligent director is
more likely to be hit b7 lightning after leaving her board meeting than
she is to pa7 damages. M'hy then would any rational director expend
significant time or effort to manage a company with care?"'
To answer this question, we begin by highlighting another mysterious aspect of the case law on the duty of care that has long provoked
law professors and students alike-the fact that, even while courts
have steadfastly refused actually to sanction directors for failing to use
due care, they have continued to insist that a duty to use reasonable

102(b)(7) as allowing firms to "opt out" of the duty of care. LVe reject this characteriration because the provision does not excuse directors from using care-it merely relieves then1 of personal liability for damages for failing to d o so. See, r.g., Rock, supra

Although our discussion focuses on the fact that the duty of care does not a p

<-----Page 58----->care exists.'"' k n Gorkom itself offers an example. In interpreting the
"informed" element of the business judgment rule, the Delaware Supreme Court held, "[tlhe determination of whether a business judgment is an informed one turns on whether the directors have informed themselves. . . 'of all material information ?-easonablyavailable
to them."'lifi The court then went on to state, "[wle think the concept
of gross negligen,ce is . . . the proper standard for determining whether a
business judgment reached b7 a board of directors was an informed

one.
Consider the schizophrenic qualit)- of this statement. In exhorting directors to inform themselves of all material information reasonably available, the court uses the language of negligence, impliedly
testing directors' conduct b7 the standard of the "reasonable person."
Yet in the next breath, the court makes clear that no liabiliv mi11 be
imposed unless the directors are grossly negligent-a far more lax
standard of behavior.'" This bipolar aspect of corporate case law has
been noted by a number of scholars, among them Melvin Eisenberg,
who has prominently argued that in corporate law generally-and in
duty of care cases in particular-"the standards of conduct and review
I :,<I
penlasively diverge.
The standard of ronclurt for directors (courts
say) is that of the reasonabl~prudent person. But the standard of 7-ev i m (that is, the circumstances under which courts will intervene and
impose sanctions) is the business judgement test of gross negligence.
IVhy is the standard of review in duty of care cases so much less
demanding than the standard of conduct? The most frequent explanation offered is that the business world is complex, opaque, and uncertain. h a result, it is almost impossible for a judge, after the fact,
to determine reliably whether a particular board's decision was or was
not reasonable at the time it was made. Making it easy for plaintiffs to
prevail in duty of care cases according17 could result in frequent legal
error, as courts both dismiss meritorious cases and award damages in

cases without merit.lbOThe first type of error undermines, perhaps fatally, the value of la~vsuitsas vehicles for deterring careless conduct.
The second raises the specter of other harms, such as groundless
"strike" suits filed by plaintiffs' lawyers who hope to extract a settlement, or overanxious directors who avoid any risky course of business,
Ibl
however profitable.
These are good reasons for courts to make it difficult to sue corporate directors for negligence. But there remains the essential question of why directors shielded from liability for negligence should
bother to exercise due care. Also, if the business judgment rule is the
proper standard of review, what purpose is served by suggesting that
the standard of conduct be higher?
Under the nexus of contracts approach and its assumption of rational selfishness, the mysteries of the business judgement rule and
the duty of care remain just that-mysteries. If directors respond only
to carrots and sticks, and if both are noticeably missing from the
boardroom, why should we expect directors to do (as they mostly
seem to do) tolerabl~decent jobs of representing the interests of firms
and their shareholders? And why do courts continue to preach the
gospel of due care while refusing to punish the "sinners" who fail to
meet that standard?'"' W%y should a court waste its breath?
Both Melvin Eisenberg and Edward Rock have recently offered
provocative and related answers to these questions. Writing separately
in articles published in 1997 and 1999, Eisenberg and Rock each note
that over the past OYO decades, the relevant standard of conduct for
corporate directors under Delaware law has shifted and become more
demanding, even as the standard ofjudicial review has become, if anything, more lax.'"' They further argue that conventional corporate
law scholarship cannot explain such developments because it fails to

In Part I, we described the fear of such slings and arrows as falling

its essentially external character. In relying primarily on social sanctions and reputational concerns to explain why norms are follo~ved,

that people might follo\+,a social norm to avoid reputational harm

a court of law may also be difficult to prove in the court of public
opinion. Even when other rnernbers of the business community can
observe accusations and disagreements between and among shareholders, officers, and directors, they may find it hard to determine
which side is at fault. Moreover, in many cases they are unlikely to obsene even the accusations and disagreements. The boardroom is a

Corporate case law accordinglv can encourage corporate participants to internalize norms of cooperation through social framingproviding information about the social context of relationships within
the finn. Judicial opinions unambiguousl~~
communicate that directors are fiduciaries and that fiducian~relationships call for trusnvortht
(lotal and careful) behavior. Corporate directors internalize this
norm when thev respond to the social signal bv adopting the otherregarding preference function that is the hallmark of trust-based relationships. In other words, fidunary duty law works throz~ghframzng,not
shamzng.
The behavioral phenomenon of trust thus offers a critical addition
to the arguments of Eisenberg, Rock, and other scholars who argue
for norms-based theories of corporate law. In particular, it provides
support for the idea that discussions of fiducian duty in corporate
case law act as judicial "sermons" on proper motives and conduct that
filter down to directors, officers, and shareholders through corporate
lawyers and the business press.17"Courts preach these sermons not to
enlist the aid of third-party "norms enforcers," but primarilv to influence corporate participants' behavior more directlt by fleshing out

the social context of their relationships, and particularly by framing
relationships between managers and their firms as fiduciary relationships based on trust.
The empirical ekldence reviewed in Part I1 suggests why judicial
opinions may be especially po~verfuland effective vehicles for per;1;
Social dilemma experiments indiforming this framing function.
cate that individuals trying to decide whether a particular social context calls for cooperation or competition are remarkably sensitive to
the signals they receive from the experimenter who defines and has
authority over the game. In the context of corporate law, the court, as
the authority charged with both creating and enforcing many corporate law rules, may play the role of the experimenter and enjoy similar
influence. M l e n the Delaware chancery court trumpets the importance of careful attention to fiduciary duties, directors and officers are
likely to heed that call-even though they may have little or no external incentive for doing so.
Corporate case law may also have a second and previously unrecognized effect on director, officer, and shareholder behavior through
the information that it provides about the behavior of other directors,
officers, and shareholders. Recall that one of the important influences on decisions to cooperate or defect in social dilemma games
appears to be expectations about what other players are likely to do.'iX
That finding raises the possibility that judicial doctrines, such as the
business judgment rule, that make it difficult to sue corporate participants for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty may in fact reduce the incidence of such breaches. Conversely, trying to shore up trust behavior by making it easier for corporate participants to "litigate trust" may
produce the counterintuitive result of an increase in the incidence of
the untrustworthy beha~ior.
The argument goes as follo~+~s.
Lawsuits can indeed help deter
opportunism by creating a threat that opportunistic behavior hill be
punished, if detected and proven. But at the same time, la~vsuits-if
rnernbers of the business community are aware of them-unavoidably
send the signal that others in the business world are choosing to violate their fiduciary duties. The more suits brought, the stronger the
signal.""

these signals may be intended; others may not. But all may have an

C . 7j"Z~stBehuvzor, the I,rmrts o f l a w , and the Case
oj the Close& Held Corporutlon
Ll'e argue above that corporate law channels behavior not just by
imposing external sanctions, but also through social framing that encourages officers, directors, and shareholders to \iew their relationships as cooperative ones calling for other-regarding behavior. It
seems plausible, however, that in many circumstances corporate participants may perceive both the threat of legal sanctions and the framing effects of corporate case law as distant and relatively weak influences. Are there other, nonlegal forces that encourage and shore up
trust within firms? If so, how important is corporate law in influencing behavior?
We consider these questions below in the context of "closely held"
corporations-firms with relatively fe~vshareholders who also serve as
the firm's managers.'" A5 this description implies, closely held corporations generally do not suffer the "separation of ownership and control" thought to plague publicly held firms.'" Closely held firms are
famous for presenting their o\vn problems, however, in the form of
opportunistic behavior between shareholder^.'^' Moreover, the conventional tools used by shareholders in publicly held firms to patrol
against the agency costs imposed by professional managers-the
shareholders' rights to vote, to sell their shares, and to sue for breach

Although publiclv held firms control the lion's share of c o r p o ~ a t eassets in the

they hale relatilelv few shareholders; second, there is n o active market for their stock:

held corporations remain mutually vulnerable. As Frank Easterbrook
and Daniel Fischel describe the problem:

example of circumstances in which legal and market forces impose
only weak restraints on opportunistic behalior within the firm. Yet
despite the high degree of mutual vulnerability their participants must
endure, closely held corporations continue to exist and, indeed, to
outnumber publicly held corporations vastly. This puzzling fact has
provoked legal scholars to suggest that some coordinating force othw
than the threat of a larvsuit or the discipline of the stock market restrains opportunism in closely held firms. For example, in a recent
article, Professor Paul Mahoney proposed a norms-based model of
closely held corporations in rvhich shareholder opportunism is constrained "by the possibility of non-legal sanctions, including family or
social disapproval and loss of reputation."1'"'
For a number of reasons, horvever, such concerns seem unlikely to
curb misbehavior in most closely held corporations reliably. First.
closely held firms are often formed betrveen individuals rvho have n o

The empirical phenomenon of trust may provide the r~lissing
piece to the closely held corporation puzzle. To understand ~vhy,consider what happens in a firm in which the participants correctly perceive themselves and each other as both trusting and trustworthy. In
such a firm, each participant has to some extent incorporated the
others' welfare into her own preference function; the focus is on 711e
rather than I. Knowing this, all mill be less likely to feel either the
need for elaborate and expensive contractual protections ex ante or
the temptation to engage in wasteful squabbling over who gets what
ex post. Thus trust can reduce the costs of intershareholder opportunism in closely held corporations when legal rules (including the
rules of contract) and market pressures (including reputational concerns and the fear of social sanctions) fail to do so.
Trust only works, however, when one kno~vsthat one's fellow
shareholders in the firm are indeed trusnvorthy. This may be a dangerous thing to assume, given the empirical elidence revierved in Part
I1 that not all indi\iduals engage in trust beha\ior.Iq2 For trust to support cooperation in the absence of external enforcement mechanisms, it is essential for indiliduals inclined toward trust to be able
someho~vto "filter out" those rvho are not. Horv can a rvould-be participant in a closely held corporation ensure that her fellotv shareholders are worthy of her trust?
The problem parallels social scientists' concern over hoxv cooperative behavior can evolve in social organisms ~vhen"cooperators" are
vulnerable to exploitation by "defectors."'"' At least two selection
mechanisms have been suggested in the literature, both of rvhich may
apply to the formation of closely held firms. The first is the possibility
that trustworthy people are someho~vable to detect, and so avoid doing business with, untrustworthy individuals. Robert Frank, fhr example, has argued that trustworthiness is associated rvith observable
I'll
characteristics, like involuntarily blushing ~vhenone lies.
Reputation might perform a similar signaling function if a good reputation is
disproportionately expensive for untrustrvorthy individuals to acquire
because it requires them to pass up many tempting opportunities to

It seems plausible that trustworthy individuals can indeed sometimes id en ti^ the untrust~vorthyby obsenation or reputation and so
avoid dealing rvith them. Certainly shifty eyes and a bad reputation
are usually disadvantages in the business rvorld. But there is a second
process that may also ~vorkto exclude lo~v-trustindividuals from

works as a filter to ensure that individuals who opt into closely held

Closely held firms are usually formed .ivhen a small number of individuals agree to band together to pursue a joint enterprise. I11 effect,
the closelv held corporation begins as an "incorporated partnership"
in which each partner contributes a valuable resource or skill. Although the firm's original founders could negotiate elaborate contracts to control their future interactions, they often do not, choosing
instead to assume that they can "work things out" if conflicts appear.
And often they d o work things out. Problems tend to arise, ho~vever,
when the original founders of the firm die or retire and their interests
pass into the hands of their heirs and successors. At this point, squabbling becomes more common, and the new shareholders often find
themselves embroiled in litigation with each other.""
This pattern can be explained as a consequence of the fact that
~vhilethe original founders of a closely held firm are subject to selective pressures that favor trust-including both self-selection and partner-selection-their heirs and successors are not. The children of the
original founders acquire their shares even if they are shifty-eyed and
disreputable or even if they ~vouldnever willingly choose to participate in an arrangement that required such a high degree of mutual

By focusing on the role of selection pressures in furthering trust
in closely held corporations, .ive do not to mean to suggest that selection is irrelevant to trust in publicly held firms.'?"' Rather, .ive seek to
demonstrate how a behavioral approach counsels humility in our assumptions about the relative importance of law in encouraging cooperation and discouraging opportunism in social institutions. The case
of the closely held corporation illustrates h o ~ vbusiness relationships
characterized by a high degree of mutual vulnerability can sunive and
thrive even when legal and market forces are largely absent or impotent.
importantly, it suggests h o ~ vattempts to discourage opportunism by appealing to the law can sometimes backfire and lead to an
increase in misbehavior.
To understand why, let us return to the observation that participants in closely held corporations often decline to draft complex contracts to control their future dealings, instead preferring to deal with
conflicts informally as they arise. To some extent, this reflects the inevitable difficulties of contracting under conditions of risk and uncertainty. In some cases it may also reflect ignorance, lack of imagination, or poor legal advice. The phenomenon of trust behavior
suggests, however, that sometimes participants in closely held corporations may deliberately choose not to draft formal contracts, even \$-hen
they could do

The absence of selection among second-generation participants in a closely
held corporation can lead to patterns of distrust even when the founders' successors
are, in fact, relatively trust~vorth!. This is because it may be difficult for them to prour
this to each other when participating in the fir111 did not require a n affirmative decision to make themselves i-ulnerable, a n d so to signal their trustworthiness b! themselves displaying trust.

Indeed, the institution of the publicly held firm may petiorm a hithertounrecognized function by allowing trust behavior to persist beyond the life of the

held firms. For example, negotiating and drafting a contract encourages would-be joint venturers to communicate more clearly \\.hat each
wants to get out of their relationship. This makes it easier to take
account of each other's preferences because those preferences are
better known. It can also help avoid the sort of nasty surprises that
undermine trust in a long-running relationship. (If your partner does
something that you do not like, it can be difficult to tell if this happened because she was mistaken about what you wanted or because
she knew what you wanted but was indifferent to your welfare.) In
many closely held firms, this information-providing aspect of formal
contracting may be at least as important as the threat of legal
sanctions contract appears to bring into play.
But the reality of trust behavior cautions against the conventional
assumption that opportunism in firms (including but not limited to

This analysis focuses o n the possibility that formal contracting encourages
intrinsically untrustworthy persons to participate in closely held corporations or. at
least, leads trushvorthy persons to perceive this as a risk. It also seems likely that
explicit contracting can undermine trust between hvo individuals who each view the
other as potentially trust~vorthybecause it frames their developing relationship as a n
arm's-length one that calls for competitive rather than cooperative behavior. See
Bowles. .supra note 75, at 93, for a suggestion that cooperation is more likely when
people see contracts as being incomplete, and de5cribing experiments in which
trust in and comlllitlllent to trading partners as ell as a concern for one's
own and others' reputations emerges when product quality is variable and
non-contractible but not when it is contractible. . . . These experimental results suggest that trust o r reciprocity may depend on the form of the contract, contractual incompleteness leading to trusting and reciprocal b e h a v

unnecessary in relationships based on trust, at least when selection

Economic theory has yielded great insights into the nature of the
business firm and the role the law plays in shaping it. At the same
tirne, conventional economic analysis has proven inadequate to resolve a number of important debates and questions in corporate law.
These include the nature of corporate fiduciary duties, the mechanism by ~vhichjudicial opinions influence corporate participants' behavior, and the puzzling persistence of cooperative patterns of behavior in business situations (most obviousl~closely held firms) in which
legal and market forces seem too feeble to rein in opportunism.
In this Article we offer an explanation for these and other riddles
of corporate law. Our approach does not reject economic reasoning.
It does, however, reexamine one of its standard assumptions: the assumption that people always b e h a ~ elike homo econornlcus. We argue to

Although our analysis focuses o n the possibility that formal contract can undermine trust in closely held corporations, sinlilar arguments can be made about attempts to control opportunism in closel! held firms by making it easier for shareholders to sue each other for breach of fiduciary duty. For example, Eric Tallev has
recently argued that making it easier for shareholders in closely held corporations to
bring clainls of breach of dun. might be inefficient because it creates incentives for

benefits to others. In support of this claim, we reliew the extensive
empirical evidence that has been developed on human behavior in
social dilemma experiments. This evidence demonstrates that most
people shift readily from purely self-interested to other-regarding
modes of behavior depending on past experience and present social
context. Under the right circumstances, people can be counted upon
.ivith some degree of predictabilih to trust and to behave trusc\vorthily,
even \\.hen presented with economic incentives to do othenvise.
Relaxing the assumption that people are always self-interested in
favor of the more realistic claim that people have a capacity for socially contingent, other-regarding behavior opens new channels for
analyzing a \tide variety of relationships in which the law seeks to encourage cooperation and discourage opportunism. These include not
only relationships within families and among citizens in the broader
community but also business relationships like partnerships, relational
contracts, and (our focus here) incorporated firms.
We emphasize that we are not suggesting that legal rules, explicit
contracts, and market sanctions are unimportant in governing business relationships. Social science confirms what most of us already
kilo\$--not eveTone can be counted upon to engage in cooperative,
other-regarding behavior, no matter what social cues they are given.
Moreover, even among people inclined to behave cooperatively, trustbased relationships sometimes break dorm, and competitive behavior
sometimes yields better individual and group outcomes. In many
situations, external incentives are still important and perform exactly
the function contractarian theory assumes they perform-to promote
cooperation and rein in uncooperative, untrust.ivorthy behavior.
But the experimental evidence on trust teaches that human behavior can be influenced in a number of ways that are not captured by
the standard nexus of contracts analysis. This observation carries important implications for corporate scholars, for it suggests that an understanding of trust behavior may be an essential foundation for a
solid understanding of corporate 1a.i~. Without taking account of
trust, rve cannot fully comprehend or explain the substantive structure
of corporate law, how it channels behavior, or where its limits lie.
This is a matter of concern not only for academics but also for
judges, legislators, practicing lawyers, and businesspeople. Mistaken
assumptions about the role and importance of external incentives in
furthering cooperative behavior can lead not only to mistaken descriptions but also to mistaken prescriptions. In particular, the ex-

perimental elidence warns that attempts to provide external motivations for cooperative behavior can instead reduce cooperation by undermining corporate participants' internal motivations. In this Article,
for example, we have explored why making it easier to sue corporate
directors for breach of the duty of care might actually reduce levels of
care, if a proliferation of such lawsuits carries the unintended message
that carelessness is common behavior. Similarly, we have suggested
that using formal contracts to constrain shareholder opportunism in
closely held firms can increa~ethe likelihood of exploitative beha\ior
by interfering with the natural filtering effect of self-selection under
conditions of mutual lulnerability.
Indeed, trust can be undermined not only by using external incentives but even by using the Langzsage of external incentives. The
experimental evidence demonstrates that indi~idualstning to decide
whether to trust and behave trushvorthily are exquisitely sensitive to
the social signals they recei~eabout what sort of b e h a ~ i o ris expected
and appropriate in a given context.'"' Language is such a signal.

firm as fiduciaw relationships that call for other-regarding conduct.
But language can also erode trust.'" In particular, emplodng the
rhetoric of contract can undermine trust among corporate participants bv imphing that trusnvorthy behavior is not important, not

This last observation raises troubling questions about the dominance of contractarian talk in corporate law scholarship. TZ'hat is
