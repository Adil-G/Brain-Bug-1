T

wo majorapproachesare availablefor operationalizing
and measuringproductfamiliarity. One is to measure
productfamiliarityin terms of how much a person knows
about the product; the other is to measure familiarity in
terms of how much a person thinks slhe knows about the
product. According to the former, productfamiliaritymay
be examined with respect to the knowledge structureof an
individual's long-term memory (LTM). According to the
latter, product familiarity is based on the person's selfreport of how much s/he knows about the product (LichtensteinandFischhoff 1977). The formerapproach(amount
of knowledge) contributesto understandingthe impact of
memory contents on the decision maker's evaluation and
choice decisions; the latter (self-assessed familiarity)provides informationabout decision makers' (DM) systematic
biases and heuristicsin choice evaluations and decisions.
The objective of the present study is to examine, in a
descriptive framework, decision (evaluation) biases and
heuristics of consumers at different levels of familiarity,
with specific attentionto the impact on such informationprocessing heuristics as (1) perceptual category breadth,
(2) use of functionaland nonfunctionalproductdimensions,
(3) decision time, and (4) confidence in choice.

ploy differentcriteriain assessing familiarity, thus making
comparisons across subjects difficult. This assessment is,
therefore, made using a common base defined in terms of
the subject's perceived knowledge of those dimensions importantin the evaluation of the product.
Although later material will discuss in detail how the
three levels of familiaritydiffer, to understandthe ensuing
theory section it would be helpful to be aware of the necessary conditionsthatwere establishedfor specifying a subject's level of familiarity with the product, a microwave
oven. Specifically, in order to maximize the difference in
self-assessed familiaritylevels among subjects, the following three prior behavioral considerations were specified:
(a) microwave oven information search experience; (b)
microwaveoven usage experience;and (c) microwaveoven
ownershipstatus. A subjectwith no information-searchexperience, no product-usageexperience, and nonownership
was definedto have low familiarity(LF). A subjectdefined
to have a moderatelevel of familiarity(MF) met conditions
(a) and/or (b), but not (c). A subject classified as having
high familiarity (HF) had search experience, usage experience, and was a microwave oven owner. For reasons to
be discussed later, subjects in the MF and the HF groups
were also provided with information(from ConsumerReports and ConsumerBuying Guides) that would influence
their self-assessed knowledge of the product, microwave
ovens.
When familiarity is defined subjectively, controlling
prior behavioral activities, it is treated as a "state" variable, and two points should be noted. First, the three familiarity groups are expected to differ in their information
about the product, their subjectivejudgment of cue selection and processing (i.e., confidence in choosing and processing product attributesfor a choice decision task), and
their organization of product information in long-term
memory. Second, due to differences in prior behavioral
activities (prior interest in the product class), differences
among the three groups may be expected in their motivational involvement with the experimentaltask.

THEORY
PerceptualCategoryBreadth
In the present study, it is proposed that a decision
maker's level of product familiarityaffects her perceptual
category breadth. According to Bruner (1957), perceptual
categorybreadthrefersto a DM's viewing the variouslevels
of a given dimension, e.g., size, as belonging to different
categories, e.g., small, medium, large. A dimensionwhose
levels are assigned to few categories, i.e., where there is
very little discrimination, is said to have broad category
breadth, i.e., each category covers a large range of the
dimension's levels (Brunerand Tajfel 1961; Pinson 1978).
Two factors are considered in examining category
breadth-a cognitive capability and a psychological desire
to differentiateamongdimensionalcategories. In this study,
category breadth assumes that the DM has both the cognitive ability to differentiateamong dimensionalcategories
and utility differences across these categories. A DM at LF
(low familiarity) is expected to exhibit broad category
breadthwith respect to the functional product dimensions
evaluated. The greaterthe numberof categoriescreatedfor
the classificationof a dimension's levels, i.e., the narrower
the category breadth, the more difficult is the assignment
of utility, because more classes exist that require evaluation. With only indirect informationor experience (based
on other productusage) to draw upon and with the absence
of a well-established dimensional salience hierarchy, the
assignmentof utility to a large numberof categories would
be a difficult and frustrating task. One way of reducing
frustration and cognitive burden would be to broaden a
dimension's categories, i.e., reduce the numberof perceptual categories on that dimension.
The DM at MF (moderatefamiliarity)has relevant and
neededproductinformationfrom previoususage experience
and/or from informationmaterialprovided to them. However, this DM has ratherfragmentedinformationabout the
meaning of dimensions and their salience hierarchy. Although this informationis less than desired, it does aid in
the DM's constructive process of a choice decision, thus

reducing the degree of complexity involved. The MF DM
is, therefore,capableof processing greateramountsof, and
more complex, information (Park and Lessig 1977). To
facilitate the development of this complex processing, the
MF DM is expected to have narrowercategory breadth,
i.e., more categories.
The HF DM is also expected to have a narrowercategory
breadththan the DM at LF. Based on previous purchase
decision making and on usage experience, the HF DM has
developed a relatively complex and rigidly fixed utility for
different levels of the various dimensions and their associated salience. This information, which is contained in
long-termmemory, is well definedand effectively retrieved
for a specific choice decision task (Bettman 1979). Category breadthfor the HF DM is not expected to differ from
that of the MF DM. Although the HF DM has more experience and knowledge than the DM at MF and presum-

ably is more capable of elaborateprocessing, she may employ categories less refined than those for which she is
capable.

Reliance on Price and Brand Name Information
It is proposed that confidence in the utilizationof brand
name and price informationis a function of the DM's familiarity level. Based upon previous discussion, it would
seem that a DM at LF would find it less difficult and be
more confident to extrapolatea product's utility from familiar concepts, such as the nonfunctionaldimensions of
price and brandname, than from unfamiliarproductfunctional dimensions. This is consistent with Tversky and
Kahneman's (1974) availability heuristic, which refers to
the ease with which relevant instances of an event can be
broughtto mind.
The DM at HF is also expected to have high confidence
in usage of brand name and price in the choice decision.
Due to her previous purchase experience and knowledge
aboutthe brandthat she owns, brandname and its price are
expected to be placed very high on a dimensional salience
hierarchywith high confidence. Due to her knowledge, the
DM at MF is not expected to find it as difficult or as ambiguous to rely on the functional attributes as is the LF
DM. Nor is the MF DM expected to have biases toward
these dimensions that are as strong as those expressed by
the HF DM. Given this and her ability to form utility
through informationon functional dimensions, the DM at
MF would not feel as confident as LF and HF decision
makers in evaluating choice options through the use of
brandname and price information.The DM at MF is thus
expected to have a higher confidence in functionaldimensions than in price and brand-namedimensions.

Decision Time
The time required to make a decision is an important
process-tracingmeasure (Hansen 1972). A number of investigators have describedthe consumer's decision task as
consisting of two general stages (Howard and Sheth 1969;
Park 1978; Payne 1976). In the first stage (choice reduction), the consumer reduces the numberof available alternatives to a smaller set consisting of those options considered to be acceptable. In the second stage (choice
selection), the consumer decides which alternativeamong
those in the acceptable set is best. In the present study,
decision time is hypothesized to be a function of both the
level of the consumer's productfamiliarityand the stage of
the decision process. Specifically, in the choice reduction
state, the DM at MF is expected to requiremore time than
either LF or HF decision makers.
This expectationis in line with Pollay's (1970) and Kiesler's (1966) findings on the nonmonotonicrelationshipbetween decision time and the difficulty of the choice task.
According to Pollay and Kiesler, decision time is expected
to increase as difficulty increases until the choice becomes
quite difficult, at which point decision time decreases. On

<-----Page 3----->IMPACTOF FAMILIARITY
the other hand, the HF DM can achieve informationsearch
and processingefficiency due to her high level of familiarity
(Sheth and Venkatesan 1968). This should result in the HF
DM requiringless decision time than the DM at MF.
Decision time at the choice selection stage is expected
to exhibit a different patterndue to changed perceptionof
the task's difficulty. Specifically, during the choice reduction stage, the LF DM greatly simplified her choice task.
This simplificationnow makes choice less difficult than at
the reductionstage. The DM now feels motivatedto select
the brandthat will give her the greatest utility. This motivation is expected to lead her to a careful and perhapstimeconsuming examination of additional information, due to
lack of familiarity.Furthermore,when the remainingalternatives are barely discriminableon those dimensions upon
which she heavily relied in the choice reductionstate, the
DM may be forced to consider additionalinformationfor
which she is not an efficient informationprocessor. On the
other hand, the thoroughnessof the choice reductionactivities of the MF DM is likely to make her task simpler at
the choice selection stage, although she is a careful information processor. This implies that the decision-making
time difference between a DM at LF and a DM at MF
would not be significant at the choice selection stage.
The HF DM is very efficient in processing information
due to her well-established cognitive structurerelating to
decision alternatives.Therefore, she is expected to need a
shorterdecision time in her selection than is requiredby LF
and MF decision makers.

Choice Confidence
The degree of confidence that the DM places on the appropriatenessof the ultimate choice is viewed as being related to the DM's familiarity.' The LF DM is expected to
feel less confident than the MF DM, who has relevant
knowledge for the decision-making task. The HF DM is
also expected to have higher confidence in the choice than
the MF DM, due to the HF DM's greater product usage
experience and ownership. The confidence of the DM in
her choice is thus hypothesized to increase monotonically
with the level of her familiarity, for both the choice reduction stage and the choice selection stage.

HYPOTHESES
Based on the previous section, the following hypotheses
are proposed:
Hi:

The perceptualcategory breadthon functional
dimensions of the DM at a low level of familiarity is broader than that of DMs at either a
moderateor a high level of familiarity.

'The confidence referredto in this section deals with the DM's overall
confidence in the chosen brand. Confidence in the earlier setting referred
to the DM's certaintythat reliance on a particularproductdimension will
enhance her overall satisfaction. Similar distinctions have been made in
previous research(Bennett and Harrell 1975).

225
H2: There is a significantdifference between a DM
at a moderate level of familiarity and DMs at
either a low or a high familiaritylevel with respect to the processing and utilization of the
nonfunctional dimensions of brand name and
price. Specifically:
H2a: A DM at a moderatelevel of familiarityfeels
less confidentin relyingon price and brand
namethanDMsat eithera low or a highlevel
of familiarity.
H2b: A DM at a low level of familiarityfeels more
confidentin relyingon the nonfunctional
dimensionsof priceandbrandnamethanin relyingon functionaldimensions.
H2c: A DM at a moderatelevel of familiarityfeels
less confidentin relyingon the nonfunctional
dimensionsof price and brandnamethanin
relyingon functionaldimensions.
H2d: A DM at a high level of familiarityfeels as
confidentin relyingon the nonfunctional
dimensionsof priceandbrandnameas in relying
on functionaldimensions.
H3a: In reducing the alternativesto a smaller set of
acceptable options, the decision time of a DM
at a moderatelevel of familiarityis greaterthan
that of DMs at either low or high levels of familiarity.
H3b: In selecting the best alternativein the acceptable
set, the decision time of DMs at either low or
moderatelevels of familiarityis greaterthanthat
of a DM at a high level of familiarity.
H4: The DM at low familiarityfeels less confident
than moderatefamiliarityDMs, and the DM at
a moderatefamiliaritylevel feels less confident
than the DM at high familiarity.This holds for
both the choice reductionand the choice selection stages.

SUBJECTS
Data were obtained from 99 women living in a midwestern college community.2Each subject was contacted
by telephone and asked whether she had ever searchedfor
informationabout microwave ovens, had ever used a microwaveoven, and currentlyowned a microwaveoven. The
responses were used to assign the subject to one of three
familiaritygroups: low familiarity(LF), 37 subjects;moderate familiarity (MF), 29 subjects; and high familiarity

2Eighty percent of the participants were randomly selected. The remaining 20 percent, althoughstill representinga cross section of the community, were selected throughconvenience, in an attemptto balance the
numberof subjects possessing differentdegrees of productfamiliarity.

<-----Page 4----->226
(HF), 33 subjects. These three conditions were chosen to
maximally discriminateamong familiarity groups. Due to
the absenceof informationsearch, productusage, andproduct ownership, the product familiarity and knowledge of
subjectsin the LF group can clearly be differentiatedfrom
those in the MF and HF groups. The MF subject, who had
eithersearchor usage experience (or both), but did not own
the product, was not expected to have as much knowledge
about dimensional importance as an individual who had
priorpurchasingexperience and was a productuser.
All of the MF subjects had prior product usage experience, but very few had searchedfor informationregarding
productattributesor differences among various brands.3It
was, therefore, believed desirable to provide the MF subjects with relevantinformationthat could be used to further
extend the subjective assessment of familiaritybetween the
LF and MF groups. Furthermore,it was believed necessary
to provide the HF subjects with the same informationin
order to create among the MF and HF subjects common
definitional characterizations of the various microwave
oven attributes. Thus, possible dependent variable differences between the MF and HF subjects would not be attributedto the informationprovided to the MF subjects.
The informationgiven to the MF and HF subjects contained answers to questions commonly asked about microwave ovens (e.g., What are microwaves? Why do foods
cook so quickly?) and descriptionsof the functionalnature
of microwave oven attributes(e.g., What is an expanded
scale timer? What is a safety start?). No informationconcerning price or brand name was given. The materialwas
obtained from Consumer Reports, Consumer Buying Guide,

and literaturepublished by manufacturersto increase the
study's reality, as functional attributeinformationof this
type is availableto the consumer.4The MF and HF subjects
were asked to examine this material prior to the personal
interview and again prior to the experiment.

THEJOURNALOF CONSUMERRESEARCH

EXPERIMENTAL TASK AND DATA
At the beginning of the interview, the subject indicated,
through a five-point scale (ranging from "very familiar"
coded as 5, to "unfamiliar" coded as 1), her opinion on
which microwaveoven featureswould be importantin making a choice.5 The subject was then presenteda matrixthat
described 15 models of microwave ovens in terms of ten
dimensions: brand, price, type of microwave distribution,
numberof cooking levels, expanded scale timer, temperature setting, browner, microwave leakage, safety start, and
usable oven capacity. Most of the descriptions accurately
portrayedmodels available at the time. However, in a few
instancesthe descriptionwas alteredto avoid such problems
as dominance,and to assurethata subjectcould be attracted
to any given model depending on her choice criteria.
The subjectexamined the productdescriptionmatrixand
identifiedthe options acceptableto her. She then indicated
on a seven-point scale (extremely difficult to extremely
easy) the difficulty of this choice reductiontask. She also
indicated, on a five-point scale (extremely confidentto not
confidentat all), her confidence in the selections made with
respectto her perceivedcertaintythatthe alternative(s)chosen will enhance her overall satisfaction. The options just
identifiedas being acceptable were then reevaluatedto determine which would be her first choice. The perceived
difficulty of this choice selection task was also measured.
The subject verbalized her thoughts (which were tape recorded)while performingboth the choice reductionand the
choice selection tasks; the time (rounded to the nearest
minute) requiredto complete each task was also noted.
Also, for each of the ten microwave oven dimensions,
the subject indicatedon a seven-point scale her confidence
that reliance on the dimension would enhance the satisfaction that she received from the oven chosen. Finally, for
each dimension, she indicated(using an 11-pointscale) the
satisfactionshe would receive from each of the dimension's
levels, e.g., for the dimension "browner," the satisfaction
associated with having and with not having a browner.

FINDINGS
3Whenthe MF group was near its targetsize (approximately90 percent
of the desired cell size), only two of these subjects had searched for
informationregardingdifferences among microwave oven brands or for
informationon productattributeperformance.For the remainingMF subjects, selected througha convenience method, the authorsdid not identify
how many had informationsearch experience.
'The information on the functional aspects of each microwave oven
attributewas descriptive and provided both positive and negative information. For example, the following informationwas providedon the attribute "microwave leakage": "Microwave radiationis not the same as
X-ray or nuclear radiation.X-rays and nuclear radiationcan create electrically charged (that is, ionized) molecules capable of damagingcells by
interferingwith the process of cell division. In contrast, microwaves are
nonionizing; any effect they may have is said to be thermal-the effect
of heat on body tissue. The U.S. Bureau of Radiological Health has set
limits to prevent harmful levels of microwave exposure. The emission
standardfor microwave ovens before sale sets a limit of one milliwatt of
leakage per square centimeter (1 mWlcm2). After sale, a maximum of 5
mWlcm2 is permittedto allow for some deteriorationof the oven over its
lifetime."

Verbal Protocol Examination
Sixty-two of the tape-recordedprotocolswere transcribed
and divided into coded phrases;6these 62 contained24, 15,

'As a check on the previously determined familiarity levels, the responses were compared across the familiarity groups through one-way
ANOVA using Duncan's Multiple Range test. The average familiarities
across groups were significantly different at the 0.05 level and in the
anticipateddirection. The mean perceived familiarityfor the LF, MF, and
HF subjects were 1.89, 3.13, and 4.05, respectively.
6Twentyof the 99 protocols were deleted because verbalizationscould
not be understood or because decisions were made without verbalizing
their thoughts. Much to our distress, an additional 17 protocols were
accidentallydestroyed.

<-----Page 5----->.IMPACTOF FAMILIARITY
and 23 subjects from the LF, MF, and HF groups, respectively. Two coders then independentlyexamined each protocol statementto determinewhich productdimensions the
subject had used in her choice task. For most of the 62
protocols,the two coders agreedin their assessment. Where
there was disagreement, the subject had recognized variation across models on the dimension, but did not use the
dimension in making a choice; such a dimension was discarded. The coders decided that the attributewas used for
processing when examined in any of the following ways:
attribute comparison process (e.g., attribute evaluation
across brands), within-brandprocess (e.g., examining the
attributesof a particularbrand),and use of priorknowledge
for evaluating attributes.7Based on this understanding,the
two coders agreed in their evaluation of all 62 protocols.
Next, a third coder independentlyexamined ten randomly
selected protocols;his evaluations agreed with those of the
other two.8

PerceptualCategoryBreadth
The subject's satisfactionassociated with each of the dimension's levels was used to measure perceptualcategory
breadth-the number of different satisfaction scale values
that the subject assigned to the dimension's levels. The
fewer the number of satisfaction categories used, the
broader the breadth (Clayton and Jackson 1961). As the
eight functional dimensions examined in this study differ
in numberof levels, the measure of breadthwas standardized by dividing the number of categories assigned to a
dimension by the numberof levels of that dimension.
In analyzing perceptualcategory breadth,only the functional dimensions identified as having been processed and
utilized by the subject in her choice task were considered;
these dimensions were identifiedfrom the protocol data. A
subject's standardizedbreadthscores on these dimensions
were then averagedto measure her-total category breadth.
Using ANOVA, these scores (for the 62 protocol subjects)
were then compared across the three familiarity groups.
The mean values for the LF, MF, and HF groups were
0.66, 0.76, and 0.76, respectively (the smaller the value,
the broader the breadth). As expected (Hypothesis 1), a
significant difference does not exist between the MF and
HF groups. It should also be noted that although not significant(p < 0.16), the directionaldifferencesbetween LF
category breadthand that of MF and HF are as expected.

Reliance on Price and Brand Name
Hypotheses 2 through2d are concerned with the difference of confidencein price and brandname amongthe three

227

familiaritygroups. These hypotheses were tested using responses to how confident a subject was in relying on the
particulardimension in maximizingher overall satisfaction.
Significantdifferences(p < 0.05) are noted when Duncan's
multiple range test is used to compare across familiarity
groups, confidencein price, and confidence in brandname.
For brandthe average confidence scores were 5.38, 4.79,
and 5.85 for the LF, MF, and HF groups, respectively (7
= very confident, 1 = not confident at all). The LF, MF,
and HF groupaveragesfor price were 5.19, 5.10, and 5.89,
respectively. The DM at MF shows less confidence than
DMs at either low or high familiaritylevels in relying on
brand-name information. This observation is consistent
with Hypothesis 2a. Also, as expected, when confidence
in the usage of price informationis examined, the DM at
MF shows significantlyless confidence than the DM at HF
(p < 0.05); on the other hand, no significantdifference is
noted between the MF and the LF decision makers. These
observationsare inconsistent with Hypothesis 2a. Perhaps
the LF subjects do not perceive price as being as useful an
index of quality as is brandname (Parkand Winter 1979).
An examinationof the confidence scores for brandname
and for price, as compared to those for the functional dimensions, reveals that the LF DM places higherconfidence
on the nonfunctionaldimensions (5.36 average score for
brand name and price) than on the functional dimensions
(4.59 average for the eight functional dimensions). This
contrastis statisticallysignificant(p < 0.003) and supports
Hypothesis 2b. On the other hand, the MF DM placed less
confidence in her usage of price and brand name (mean
score of 4.87) than on her usage of any of the functional
dimensions (average score is 5.43); this difference is also
significant(p < 0.02) and supportsHypothesis2c. Finally,
the HF DM appearsto place as much confidence on price
and brandname (average of 5.86) as on usage of the functional dimensions (average of 5.88).
Examinationof Hypotheses 2b, 2c, and 2d reveals a significantinteraction(p < 0.008) between level of familiarity
and dimensiontype (but this does not assume independence
for the within-subjectresponses).

Decision Time
Hypothesis3a states that in the choice-reductiondecision
stage, the MF DM would requirea significantlylonger time
to complete the task than DMs at either LF or HF. An
ANOVA on the decision times for subjects in the three
familiaritygroupssupportsthis hypothesisat the 0.01 level;
the mean decision times were 6.70, 9.38, and 7.72 for
subjects in the LF, MF, and HF groups, respectively.
Hypothesis 3b, on the other hand, states that LF and MF
decision makers will require significantly more time than
the HF DM in the choice selection decision stage. To test
Hypothesis 3b, an adjustmentin the data base was made
to nullify (or standardize)the effect that differing numbers
of choice options would have on decision time comparisons

<-----Page 6----->228
across familiaritygroups.9 As a result of this standardization, when ANOVA (Duncan'sMultipleRange test) is used
to comparethe subsets on the basis of decision time, differences in decision time are a reflectionof familiarityand
not the number of options evaluated. The mean decision
time for the LF, MF, and HF subsets were 2.43, 2.14, and
1.04, respectively (p < 0.08). Duncan's Multiple Range
test showed the differences between the low and the high
familiaritysubsets and between the moderateand the high
familiaritysubsets to be marginallysignificant(p < 0.10).
No significant difference was found between the low and
the moderatefamiliaritysubsets. These findingsmarginally
supportHypothesis 3b.
These findings are furthersupportedby an examination
of the perceived difficulty of the decision task. ANOVA
across the three familiarity groups on the perceived difficulty of the decision task at the choice reduction stage
showed that the LF DM perceived the task to be more
difficult than did MF and HF decision makers(p < 0.002).
Because of her perceived task difficulty, the LF DM is
expected to greatly simplify her decision task, reducingthe
decision time from that which would be expected from
looking at perceived task difficulty only.
However, ANOVA showed no significant difference
among the three groups in the level of task difficulty.

Confidence in Decision
Hypothesis4 states that a DM's confidence in her choice
decision increases monotonically with her level of familiarity in each of the two choice tasks. Subjectresponses on
confidencein the decision were analyzedthroughDuncan's
Multiple Range test; the findings partially supportthe hypothesis.
Specifically, confidenceincreasesmonotonicallywith the
level of familiarity.At the choice reductionstage, the monotonic increases in confidence between the LF and the MF
groups and between the LF and the HF groups are both
significant at the 0.05 level; no significant difference was
noted between the MF and the HF groups. The monotonic
increases in confidence with familiarityis also noted at the
choice selection stage with the difference between the low
and the high familiaritygroups also significantat the 0.05
level. No significantdifference, however, is noted between

9This standardizationwas accomplished by comparing decision time
(at the choice-selection stage) across three subsets, one for each of the
three familiaritygroups. Each subset contained 21 subjects. The subsets
were constructed such that the number of subjects who evaluated "x"
choice options was the same for each of the subsets. Assume, for example,
that four LF DMs, six MF DMs, and seven HF DMs evaluated three
microwave ovens at the choice-selection stage; the LF, MF, and HF decision time subsets, then, would respectively contain all four of these LF
DMs, four of the six MF DMs (selected randomly),and four of the seven
HF DMs. Throughsuch a procedure,the compositionof the three subsets
were identical in terms of the numberof subjects who evaluated a given
numberof choice options. Equalizingacross familiaritygroups, the number of subjectsevaluating "x" choice options resultedin the exclusion of
36 of the 99 subjects from the standardizedsubsets.

THEJOURNALOF CONSUMERRESEARCH
the low and the moderatefamiliaritygroups. This suggests
that the LF group is perhaps more confident than they
should be, and the MF group is less confident than they
should be.
Unlike subjects in other familiaritygroups, the LF subjects expressed greaterconfidence in their choice reduction
decision than in their decision at the choice selection stage.
Although this difference is not significantat the 0.05 level,
it seems to supportthe implicationsof previous discussion
on the LF DM's choice processes at the two differentchoice
tasks, i.e., more elaborateprocessingat the choice selection
stage led the LF group to think that they chose the right
brand no matter how low their perceived level of knowledge.

DISCUSSION
The decision biases and heuristics revealed by the three
groups of subjects may be close approximationsof those
used by consumers at different stages of familiarity. Specifically, the decision (evaluation)biases and heuristicsrevealed by the LF subjects are expected to be found among
consumerswho do not have priorproduct-usageexperience,
are not equippedwith relevantinformationaboutbranddifferences and the functional product attributes (no information search), and do not own the product. The MF subjects' evaluationbiases and heuristicsmay be representative
of those who have some product-usageexperience, possess
relevantinformation,but do not currentlyown the product.
The HF subjects' evaluation and decision biases are expected to be found among consumers who currentlyown
the productand have relevant productknowledge.
These generalizations should, however, be made with
some caution. Specifically, the presentstudy and the study
by Bettman and Park (1980), using the same design and
subjects, were not able to address motivationaldifferences
among the three groups of subjects in terms of the degree
of their prior interest in microwaves and the impact of this
interest on the study's findings. These questions are important in view of the recent findings about the state-ofmindeffect on utility formationand choice decision (Wright
and Kriewall 1980).
It is highly likely thatdifferences among the threegroups
exist in the subjects' enduringinvolvement (Rothschildand
Houston 1980) or prior interest in the product. The LF
subjects would have a lower prior interest in the product
than the MF group who had some prior product-usageexinformation;the MF
perienceand relevantproduct-attribute
interest may have been heightened throughreceiving relevant information material. Similarly, the MF subjects
would have a lower interestin the productthan HF subjects
who have actually purchasedthe product.
Did differences in enduring involvement (prior interest)
affect the situational involvement (involvement with the
experimentaltask)? A concern of particularinterest could
relate to the LF subjects. Could their low interest in the
experimentaltask have affected the results (i.e., "I am not

<-----Page 7----->IMPACTOF FAMILIARITY
interested in microwave ovens, thus I'm not really interested in this 'choose a microwave oven' task."). Several
of the study's findingsdo not appearto supportthis possible
bias. If the LF subjects had little involvement in the experimentaltask, they might simply have given up, using
significantly fewer attributesand requiringa substantially
shorter decision time than subjects in the MF and HF
groups. However, comparisonof the numberof dimensions
used in the choice-reduction stage revealed no significant
difference among the three groups; the average numberof
dimensions used by the LF, MF, and HF subjects were
5.58, 6.60, and 6.04, respectively. Similarly, at the choiceselection stage, no significantdifference among the groups
was noted; at this stage the average numberof dimensions
used were 2.71, 2.58, and 2.68 for the LF, MF, and HF
groups, respectively. Also, careful examinationof the protocols revealed that most of the subjects in the LF groups
triedto infer the meaningof variousproductattributesbased
on experience with other products, and lamentedtheir lack
of knowledge about microwave ovens (Bettman and Park
1980).
Decision-time comparisonsamong the three groups also
do not appearto supportthe notion of a bias among the LF
subjects. Although there was a significantdifference in decision time at the choice-reductionstage between the LF
and MF subjects, and between the MF and HF subjects,
there was no significantdifference between subjects in the
LF and the HF groups. Furthermore,at the choice-selection
stage, the LF group requiredthe longest time to make a
decision, whereasthe HF subjectsrequiredthe least. If the
level of prior interesthad influencedthe subjects' decision
duringthe experimentaltask, the reverse decision time order would have been expected. It should also be noted that
the MF subject's motivationwith the task could have been
higher than that of the LF and HF subjects. It could be
argued that this motivation rather than the subject's perceived knowledge systematicallyinfluencedthe findings of
this study and the Bettman and Park (1980) paper, which
revealed more extensive processing by MF than by LF or
HF subjects. However, an examination of the category
breadth, decision time, and confidence analyses show no
evidence of a systematic bias.
Finally, given that there is no commonly accepted (or
even proposed)conceptualdefinitionof productfamiliarity,
the results of this study should be interpretedin accordance
with how the level of familiarity was operationalized.If,
for example, the level of the DM's familiarity is defined
differently, e.g., in terms of the amount of knowledge in
long-term memory, a different set of research questions
may be raised. To illustrate, investigation is needed into
the information-acquisitionprocess of decision makers at
differentfamiliaritylevels. Particularattentionneeds to be
placed on the cognitive processes that are initiated during
exposure to communicationstimuli and to the content and
organization of the information acquired after exposure
(Edell and Mitchell 1978; Mitchell 1980). Decision makers
at different familiaritylevels may reveal differences in encoding strategiesfor which category breadthis only a part.

The decision makers may also differ in their abilities (and
modes) to retrieve this informationat a later point in time.
