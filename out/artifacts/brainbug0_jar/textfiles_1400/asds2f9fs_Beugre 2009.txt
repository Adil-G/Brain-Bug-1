Drawing from the literature in neuroeconomics, organizational justice, and social cognitive neuroscience,
I propose a model of neuro-organizational justice that explores the role of the brain in how people form
fairness judgments and react to situations of fairness and/or unfairness in organizations. The model integrates three levels of analysis: (a) behavioral, (b) mental (cognitive and emotional), and (c) neural. The
behavioral level deals with motivated actions displayed by the individual; the mental level deals with
information processing mechanisms and emotional arousal; and the neural level concerns the brain systems instantiating mental processes. The paper also describes a fairness theory of mind that could help
managers improve their ability to create fair working environments. The model’s implications for further
research and management practice are discussed.

This paper draws from three streams of research: social cognitive neuroscience (e.g., Lieberman, 2000, 2007; Lieberman, Gaunt,
Gilbert, & Trope, 2002; Ochsner & Lieberman, 2001), neuroeconomics (e.g., Camerer, 2007; Camerer, Loewenstein, & Prelec,
2004, 2005; Glimcher, 2003; Glimcher, Camerer, Fehr, & Poldrack,
2009; Loewenstein, Rick, & Cohen, 2008), and organizational justice (e.g., Cropanzano & Greenberg, 1997; Greenberg, 1987, 1990)
to develop a conceptual framework that explores the role of the
brain in how people form fairness judgments and react to situations of fairness and/or unfairness in organizations. Social cognitive
neuroscience encompasses the empirical study of the neural mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes (Blakemore, Winston,
& Frith, 2004; Lieberman, 2007), whereas neuroeconomics merges
methods from neuroscience and economics to better understand
how the human brain generates decisions in economic and social
contexts (Camerer et al., 2004; Fehr, Fischbacher, & Kosfeld,
2005; Loewenstein et al., 2008). Organizational justice refers to
employee perceptions of fairness (Greenberg, 1987, 1990) and
encompasses three dimensions: distributive justice—the fairness
of outcomes distribution (e.g., Adams, 1965), procedural justice—
the fairness of formal procedures underlying outcomes distribution
(e.g., Lind & Tyler, 1988; Thibaut & Walker, 1975), and interactional
justice—the fairness of interpersonal treatment (e.g., Bies & Moag,
1986; Cropanzano & Greenberg, 1997).

Apparently, these three disparate ﬁelds have little in common
and their scholars barely collaborate with one another. However,
an exploration of their respective literatures reveals that these
three domains of scientiﬁc inquiry do in fact share some commonalities. As neuroeconomists investigate the role of the brain in economic decisions, they often rely on game theory, mainly the
Ultimatum Game (UG) and the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG).
These two games include situations of fairness (e.g., Fehr &
Schmidt, 1999; Rabin, 1993), a key concept in the study of organizational justice. In fact, organizational justice scholars use the
terms fairness and justice interchangeably as I will do in this article.
For these scholars, fairness is an important yardstick that employees use to assess outcomes distribution, formal procedures, or
interpersonal treatment in organizations. Likewise, judgments of
fairness (or unfairness) in organizations occur as a result of social
interactions, a domain of interest to social cognitive neuroscientists. Thus, my aim in writing this article is to blend these three
research streams together to develop a coherent conceptual framework that explores the neural basis of fairness in an organizational
context. The fundamental premise of a neuroscientiﬁc approach of
organizational justice is that a triggering event leads to an activation of speciﬁc brain structures. This activation is followed by a
mental process that helps the person construe the event as fair
or unfair. Thus, the starting point of fairness evaluations and subsequent reactions to situations of fairness (or unfairness) is the
neural circuitry.
By using a neuroscientiﬁc approach, this article provides new
directions for research and practice in the study of organizational

justice to the extent that there is evidence that fairness is a social
organizing principle that may well be ‘built in the brain’ (Van den
Bos & Lind, 2002). This is particularly important because most
adults spend their working lives as members of organizations—
schools, companies, government agencies, and non-proﬁt organizations. As Tabibnia and Lieberman (2007) put it, ‘‘we live in a
highly social environment, in which most of the work we do is
accomplished through collaboration with others and many of the
goods we consume are consumed in the company of others or
shared with others” (p. 90). Moreover, perceptions of justice in
organizations often stem from exchanges with supervisors,
coworkers, or representatives of the organization as a whole. Such
exchanges have economic implications. Thus, to the extent that the
human mind is the driver of all economic activity (e.g., Braeutigam,
2005; Camerer et al., 2004), organizational justice scholars should
incorporate a neural perspective in their analysis of fairness in
organizations.
The model of neuro-organizational justice builds on the works
of Lieberman et al. (2002) and Reynolds (2006) and extends them
to the analysis of fairness in organizational contexts. Lieberman
et al. (2002) describes two systems in the human brain: the X-system and the C-system that people generally use to make sense of
their world. The former represents the parts of the brain that are
most closely associated with unconscious environmental stimuli,
whereas the latter represents the mechanism in which complicated reasoning is accomplished (Lieberman et al., 2002; Reynolds,
2006). Reynolds (2006) used these two systems to develop a neurocognitive model of ethical decision. However, his model did not
correlate ethical behavior with speciﬁc brain regions although it
was construed as neurocognitive. Despite this limitation, Reynolds’s model may help to shed light on the neurocognitive underpinnings of other organizational phenomena, such as
organizational justice.
The model of neuro-organizational justice integrates three levels of analysis: neural, mental, and behavioral. The behavioral level
deals with motivated actions displayed by the individual; the mental level deals with information processing mechanisms and emotional arousal; and the neural level concerns the brain systems
instantiating mental processes (e.g., Ochsner & Lieberman, 2001).
Incorporating these three levels of analysis is particularly important because simply showing brain activity is of limited use if it
does not help to explain human behaviors when they occur in social contexts (e.g., Lieberman, 2007; Ochsner & Lieberman, 2001).
Moreover, such research must be grounded in theory and incorporate multiple levels (Ochsner & Lieberman, 2001). The model of
neuro-organizational justice goes further than mere cognitive
models that focus on linear progression and thus have a limited
ability to fully capture the analysis of fairness issues in organizations. Thus, this model begins by specifying how the individual
thinks from the moment the ﬁrst stimuli are encountered through
the transmission of electrochemical signals in the brain, to the
engagement of actual behavior (e.g., Reynolds, 2006).
Recent research ﬁndings reveal that fair offers lead to increased
activity in several reward regions of the brain including the ventral
striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the left amygdala, compared with unfair proposals of
equal monetary value (Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen,
2003). By drawing from several research streams, the model of
neuro-organizational justice could help to advance interdisciplinary cross-fertilization. Speciﬁcally, the model could add to the extant literature in organizational justice because by studying the
underlying neural systems, organizational justice scholars could
effectively assess the neural underpinnings of fairness that is so
fundamental to the human experience. There is even evidence that
non-human primates (monkeys and chimpanzees) have ‘standards
of fairness’ and show strong emotional reactions when these stan-

dards are violated (Brosnan, 2009; Brosnan & de Waal, 2003). Indeed, ‘‘a basic sense of fairness and unfairness is essential to
many aspects of societal and personal decision making and underlies notions as diverse as ethics, social policy, legal practice, and
personal morality” (Sanfey et al., 2003, p. 1757). The model provides a new paradigm in the study of organizational justice and
could also contribute to the literature in neuroeconomics and
social cognitive neuroscience by applying concepts from both disciplines to organizational contexts. ‘‘Humans are endowed with a
natural sense of fairness that permeates social perceptions and
interactions” (Moll, de Oliveira-Souza, Eslinger, Gramati, & Mourao-Miranda, 2002, p. 2730). Organizations are entities where such
social perceptions and interactions often occur on a daily basis.
Although in recent years, the ability of researchers to directly
observe brain activity has increased exponentially through the
use of functional neuroimaging methods, the organizational sciences have been slower to incorporate such methods (Lee & Chamberlain, 2007). The model could also advance management practice
by highlighting the neural mechanisms underlying fairness. It
could help managers to acknowledge that fairness is a fundamental
human concern and as such, they need to pay special attention to
the impact of their own behavior on employees. As Pressman
(2006) argues, we do not learn to be fair; fairness is part of our genetic makeup. Thus, managers should be able to develop a fairness
theory of mind that could provide guidelines for creating fair working environments. ‘‘Theory of mind refers to our ability to understand other people’s motor intentions and action goals and our
ability to understand other people’s beliefs and thoughts” (Singer,
2009, p. 254). It suggests that behaviors are caused by mental
states (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). An understanding that
employees care about fairness could help managers to develop
skills that are necessary in creating fair working environments.
The present article is organized as follows. First, I use Lieberman’s
X- and C-systems as a conceptual framework to lay the groundwork for discussing the neural correlates of organizational justice.
Next, I propose the model of neuro-organizational justice. I then
discuss the model’s implications for research and practice.

X- and C-systems
Is organizational justice, construed as employee perceptions of
fairness, a behavioral reaction, a cognitive process, the result of a
neural mechanism, or does it represent a combination of these
three processes? Although the organizational justice literature
has addressed the ﬁrst two aspects of the question (e.g., Goldman
& Thatcher, 2002; Greenberg, 1990; Lind, 2001; Van den Bos &
Lind, 2002), it has largely remained mute with regard to the third
one. Fortunately, the growing body of knowledge in social cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomics may provide valuable insights to organizational justice scholars. Lieberman et al. (2002)
and Satpute and Lieberman (2006) described two systems: the
X-system and the C-system that may prove useful in exploring
the neural correlates of organizational justice (see Table 1). I rely
on these two systems to lay the groundwork for the model of neuro-organizational justice.
Functions of the X-system
Lieberman et al. (2002) and Satpute and Lieberman (2006) describe the X-system as a parallel processing, subsymbolic, pattern
matching system that produces the continuous stream of consciousness that each human being experiences. The neuroanatomy
of the X-system includes brain areas, such as the amygdala, the basal ganglia, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the lateral temporal
cortex, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Lieberman, 2007;

Adapted from Satpute and Lieberman (2006) and Lieberman (2007).

Lieberman et al., 2002; Satpute & Lieberman, 2006). The neural
components of the X-system are proposed to be slow learning, fast
operating, bidirectional, and parallel processing structures
(Satpute & Lieberman, 2006). Research shows that the amygdala
is implicated in many different kinds of phenomena, such as attitudes, stereotyping, person perception, and emotion (Ochsner &
Lieberman, 2001). Thus, it can be described as the seat of emotions.
Although the amygdala provides quick responses to fearful situations, it can also receive cortical inputs that can moderate its responses or even override them. Camerer et al. (2004) describe
the amygdala as an internal ‘hypochondriac’ which provides quick
and dirty emotional signals in response to potential fears (p. 561).
Suppose for instance, that you leave your ofﬁce late at night and
walk toward your car. You suddenly hear steps behind you. At ﬁrst,
you may wonder who might be following you. The amygdala may
be alerted for a potentially threatening situation. However, as you
turn to ﬁgure out the situation, you realize that it is your colleague
who is also leaving his/her ofﬁce. This previously unfriendly situation may now turn into a friendly one, probably leading to an amicable conversation between you and your colleague.
The X-system is construed as a connectionist network comprising units, unit activity, and connection weights and represents ‘‘a
pattern matching system whose connectivity weights are determined by experience and whose activation levels are determined
by current goals and features of the stimulus input” (Lieberman
et al., 2002, p. 211). Cognitive processes are effortless to the extent
that the X-system is responsible for automaticity. When behavior
is the result of automaticity, the individual may not be able to systematically articulate all its causes and explain it to another individual. As Camerer et al. (2004) put it, ‘‘when good performance
becomes automatic (in the form of ‘procedural knowledge’) it is
typically hard to articulate, which means human capital of this sort
is difﬁcult to reproduce by teaching others” (p. 560). Automaticity
may probably explain why sharing tacit knowledge in organizations is so difﬁcult.
The X-system uses prototypes that represent stored concepts
of objects, concepts, and language. Electrochemical representations of incoming stimuli are matched against prototypes (Lieberman et al., 2002; Reynolds, 2006). Newly encountered events or
trends are compared with existing prototypes to determine
whether they belong to speciﬁc categories or can be seen as being
connected in some manner (Baron, 2006). Prototypes are multidimensional in form and contain information necessary for action
(Reynolds, 2006). The X-system matches the situation an individ-

131

ual faces against stored prototypes. This automatic process helps
the brain to avoid using elaborate thought when facing familiar
situations. ‘‘When an individual faces a situation, this reﬂexive
pattern matching system is able to conduct a process of nonconscious analysis that accepts stimuli from the environment, transmits and organizes neutral patterns reﬂecting the stimulus, and
compares that pattern against stored prototypes” (Reynolds,
2006, p. 739). Applied to the study of fairness, one may conclude
that the X-system holds stored ‘fairness prototypes’. These fairness prototypes represent mental scripts of fair or unfair situations against which current situations are compared. Thus, the
X-system can automatically determine whether a given situation
is fair or not.
Suppose that a manager, John, is perceived as an abusive supervisor, therefore unfair. Evoking the name of John would be associated with the corresponding prototype ‘abusive supervisor’. The
good news, however, is that these associations in the X-system
are not ﬁxed or rigid but subject to change and alteration (e.g., Lieberman et al., 2002; Satpute & Lieberman, 2006). In the example of
John, the abusive supervisor, additional experience or information
that reveals that John has changed and is now a considerate supervisor may help to modify the previous association. Instead of being
associated with ‘abusive supervisor’, John may now be associated
with a new prototype ‘considerate supervisor’.
When the X-system cannot automatically handle a new stimulus, it is handed over to the C-system. This may happen under at
least two conditions: (1) the situation is a novel one for which
there is no existing prototype or (2) the decision is made by the
X-system but the individual receives outside information questioning his/her prior judgment. Lieberman et al. (2002, p. 222) note
that ‘‘the X-system’s job is to turn information that emanates from
the environment into our ongoing experience of that environment,
and it does this by matching the incoming patterns of information
to the patterns it stores as connection weights. When things match,
the system settles into a stable state and the stream of consciousness ﬂows smoothly. When they do not match, the system keeps
trying to ﬁnd a stable state, until ﬁnally the cavalry must be called
in”. The neural equivalent of the cavalry is the C-system, which
comprises neural structures implicated in high order cognitive processes, such as the different areas of the neo-cortex and the
hippocampus.
Thus, standards of fairness are transmitted to the X-system by
the C-system. The C-system is brought in line when the X-system
encounters difﬁculties it cannot solve.
Functions of the C-system
The C-system is a serial system that uses symbolic logic to produce the conscious thoughts that we experience as reﬂections on
the stream of consciousness (Lieberman et al., 2002, p. 204). It is
the mechanism in which conscious thoughts are processed. The
neuroanatomy of the C-system includes the lateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and the hippocampus, and surrounding
medial temporal lobe regions (Lieberman, 2007; Lieberman et al.,
2002; Satpute & Lieberman, 2006). The neural components of the
C-system are proposed to be fast learning, slow operating, symbolic, or propositional structures (Satpute & Lieberman, 2006).
The C-system is capable of rule-based analysis and performs a regulatory role over the X-system. Thus, the X-system is dependent on
the C-system for its supply of prototypes. The C-system functions
as an adaptive and thought creation mechanism. This adaptation
process reﬂects the human ability to learn from experience (Reynolds, 2006). Learning from experience allows individuals to avoid
situations perceived as unfair and the consequences associated
with such situations.

<-----Page 3----->132

The C-system sets the standards to the extent that an output
pattern must adhere or ﬁt a prototype in order to be categorized
as of that prototype. The anterior cingulate is linked to both the
X- and C-systems (Lieberman et al., 2002). It acts like an alarm that
encourages or allows the X-system to express its inability to adequately match particular stimuli to any known prototypes and
the need for the C-system to engage in active processing. The
C-system also focuses on novel situations. The X-system depends
primarily on the associative links formed through extensive learning histories, whereas the C-system can construct arbitrary associations between pieces of information as demanded by the current
context (Lieberman et al., 2002).
The C-system is a symbolic processing system that produces
reﬂective awareness (Lieberman et al., 2002). It has four phenomenological features: authorship, symbolic logic, capacity limits, and
alarm-driven (Lieberman et al., 2002). The C-system provides
authorship to our own thoughts and actions to the extent that each
individual initiates his/her own thought processes. The symbolic
function allows the C-system to give meaning to events. Indeed,
‘‘symbolic logic allows us to escape the limits of empiricism and
move beyond the mere representation and association of events
in world and into the realms of the possible” (Lieberman et al.,
2002, p. 221). Despite its sophistication compared to the X-system,
the C-system is limited to the extent that reﬂective thinking is constrained to one object or category of objects at any given moment
in time (Lieberman et al., 2002). Finally, the C-system serves as an
alarm because it determines the X-system’s standards.
This distinction between X-system and C-system is similar to
the one between system 1 and system 2 discussed in the decision
making and economics literature (e.g., Camerer et al., 2005; Kahneman, 2003). Like the X-system, system 1 corresponds closely to
automatic processing, whereas system 2 like the C-system corresponds closely to controlled processes, monitors the quality of
answers provided by system 1 and, in some situations, corrects
or overrides these judgments (Cohen, 2005). ‘‘The operations of
system 1 are fast, automatic, effortless, associative, and often emotionally charged; they are also governed by habit, and are therefore
difﬁcult to control or modify. In contrast, the operations of system
2 are slower, serial, effortful, and deliberately controlled; they are
also relatively ﬂexible and potentially rule-governed” (Kahneman,
2003, p. 1451). System 1 involves perceptions, whereas system 2
involves deliberate reasoning (Kahneman, 2003; Lieberman et al.,
2002). Attributes that are routinely and automatically produced
by the perceptual system or system 1, without intention or effort
have been called natural assessments (Tversky & Kahneman,
1983). The evaluation of stimuli as good or bad is a particularly
important natural assessment (Kahneman, 2003). The assessment
of whether objects are good (and should be approached) or bad
(and should be avoided) is carried out quickly and efﬁciently by
specialized neural circuitry (Kahneman, 2003).
The concept of natural assessment may also be applied to fairness. Indeed, one may speculate that the evaluation of an event
as fair or unfair is a natural assessment. Using the Ultimatum
Game, one may conclude that it is easy for players to evaluate
offers of $1 or $2 as unfair (and should be rejected) and offers of
$5 as fair (and should be accepted). Such an assessment is carried
out quickly and efﬁciently by specialized neural circuitry included
in the X-system or system 1. Lieberman, Jarcho, and Satpute (2004)
investigated the neural correlates of intuition-based and evidencebased self-knowledge on a sample of participants with high and
low experience in soccer and acting who were asked to make
self-descriptiveness judgments about words from each domain
while being scanned. They found that high-experience domain
judgments produced activation in the X-system, whereas lowexperience domain judgments produced activation in the C-system. In other words, people exert less cognitive effort when dealing

with ‘familiar’ knowledge, whereas they spend more cognitive
effort when dealing with less familiar knowledge. Likewise, Fiet,
Clouse, and Norton (2004) and Baron (2006) note that experienced,
repeat entrepreneurs generally search for opportunities in areas or
industries where they are already knowledgeable; they do so in a
less effortful, more automatic manner. Understanding these two
systems is essential to the development of the model of neuroorganizational justice, which is discussed next.

The model of neuro-organizational justice
Assumptions of the model
The model of neuro-organizational justice depicted in Fig. 1
suggests that justice judgments start with a triggering event. Justice judgments are deﬁned as evaluative statements regarding
what is fair or unfair. An example of a triggering event may be
an outcome an employee receives, a process that a departmental
unit or the company develops and implements, or an interpersonal
treatment emanating from a supervisor. All three examples are
likely to generate justice judgments. The model further suggests
that this triggering event activates speciﬁc brain regions. Two
types of brain areas, cognition-inducing neural structures and emotion-inducing neural structures may be activated. The former are
responsible for cognitive processing of information, whereas the
latter are responsible for emotional arousal. The model suggests
two paths: a cognitive neuro-organizational justice path and an
affective neuro-organizational justice path. The cognitive neuroorganizational justice path implies that the activation of cognition-inducing brain areas would inﬂuence the individual’s thought
processes that would then inﬂuence justice judgments. Justice
judgments may yield two outcomes, fair or unfair. Finally, the individual will react depending on the outcome of the justice
judgment.
The affective neuro-organizational justice path implies that the
triggering event activates emotion-inducing neural structures that
then inﬂuence justice judgments. Using this path, the model contends that justice judgments are strongly inﬂuenced by the individual’s emotional reactions toward the triggering event. As
Fig. 1 indicates, a triggering event may directly activate brain
regions that are involved in emotional arousal. When this occurs,
the individual directly acknowledges the emotional connotations
of the event. For example, in the Ultimatum Game, respondents
may already have a sense of what an unfair offer is. Once they
are proposed such offers, brain regions involved in emotional arousal may be directly activated. Thus, respondents may experience
anger or resentment toward unfair offers. Such emotions further
lead to the rejection of these offers. When emotional intensity is
strong, it may lead to a mode of operation where we just react than
think (Van Widen, 2007). Wout, Kahn, Sanfey, and Aleman (2006)
found that participants experienced more emotional arousal when
confronted with an unfair offer as compared to a fair offer. These
emotional processes may be automatic and therefore involve the
X-system.
The double arrow between cognitions and emotions suggests an
interactive effect between the two variables. Accumulated evidence suggests that emotion inﬂuences cognition and vice versa,
and these reciprocal inﬂuences are associated with modiﬁcations
in cerebral activation (Koch et al., 2007). First, cognitions inﬂuence
emotions to the extent that a cognitive reappraisal of the situation
may diminish its emotional impact. The literature on the cognitive
control of emotions has demonstrated this effect (e.g., LeDoux,
1995, 2000; Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, & Gabrieli, 2002; Ochsner &
Gross, 2005). By interpreting an event differently, the emotional
response to that event can be altered (Ochsner & Gross, 2005). As

Fig. 1. A model of neuro-organizational justice. Note: cognition-related neural activation leads to cognitive processing of information, whereas emotion-related neural
activation leads to emotional arousal.

Ochsner et al. (2002, p. 1215) put it, ‘‘We can change the way we
feel by changing the way we think, thereby lessening the
emotional consequences of an otherwise distressing experience”.
LeDoux (2000) and Ochsner et al. (2002) found that the neural
correlates of reappraisal were increased activation of the lateral
and medial prefrontal regions and decreased activation of the
amygdala and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Extended to the study
of fairness, one may speculate that the cognitive reappraisal of
an unfair situation may activate these same brain regions, thereby
allowing the individual to reduce the emotional impact of perceived unfairness.
Second, emotions inﬂuence cognitions to the extent that feelings play an important role in individual reactions to unfairness
(Murphy & Tyler, 2008; Van den Bos, 2003). Van den Bos (2003)
found that people’s emotional state at the time of making justice
judgments can determine whether or not they perceive an encounter with an authority ﬁgure to be procedurally fair or not. Likewise,
Murphy and Tyler (2008) found that positive and negative emotional reactions to perceived justice or injustice predict whether
people will or will not comply with authority decisions and rules.
As Frith and Frith (2006) point out, ‘‘When deciding what to do
we are not totally ‘‘rational” in our choice of action; our choice is
colored by emotions such as anticipated regret or desire for fairness” (p. 533).
The model construes fairness as a three-dimensional phenomenon involving the neural, mental (cognitive and emotional), and
behavioral levels. This conceptualization ﬁts well with recent
views advocated by several authors in social cognitive neuroscience (e.g., Lee & Chamberlain, 2007; Lieberman, 2007; Ochsner &
Lieberman, 2001). Lee and Chamberlain (2007) argue that three
layers of theory could be envisioned when exploring the neurocognitive bases of organizational behavior: (a) the neural layer deals
with brain activity; (b) the cognitive layer concerns internal mental processes that rely on these neutral substrates; and (c) the
behavioral layer concerns how individuals react to situations
involving social interactions in conjunction with neural or cognitive mechanisms. The model makes three key assumptions: (a) a
triggering event activates speciﬁc brain regions, (b) neural activation leads to mental processes including both cognitive processing
and emotional arousal depending on the types of brain areas activated, and (c) mental processes inﬂuence justice judgments and
reactions. It implies that organizational justice involves both cognitive and emotional mechanisms that are dependent on separable
neural systems.
However, Moll, de Oliveira-Souza, and Zahn (2008) contend
that, ‘‘though some brain regions are intrinsically tied to motivational/regulatory mechanisms and others are less so, this does
not imply clear boundaries between cognition and emotion”. The

model is used to introduce new insights in answering the two fundamental questions that are the focus of organizational justice theory. How do people form justice judgments? How do people
respond when they are fairly or unfairly treated? In the following
lines, I use neuroscientiﬁc evidence to answer these questions.
Because of the lack of studies explicitly focusing on fairness in
an organizational context, I rely on previous studies in neuroeconomics that analyze the neural correlates of fairness (see Table 2).
The neural basis of justice judgments
In the case of an event having fairness implications, the individual processes the available information to decide whether the
event is fair or unfair. The model suggests that the occurrence of
a particular event activates speciﬁc brain areas, which in turn call
on the X-system when the situation is a familiar one and the C-system when it is a novel one and requires elaborate cognitive processing. Because people develop fairness prototypes, the features
of the current situation are compared to those prototypes. The idea
of fairness prototypes has been discussed in the organizational justice literature although it did not include an analysis of their neural
correlates. Ambrose and Kulik (2001) argue that an unfamiliar object, person, or situation is categorized through a matching process
in which the perceiver compares the features of the new encounter
with the features of relevant category prototypes.
The fairness prototypes described in this model encompass
three areas: (a) distributive justice prototypes, (b) procedural justice
prototypes, and (c) interactional justice prototypes. Distributive justice prototypes concern ‘mental scripts’ of fair or unfair outcomes.
This is illustrated in the Ultimatum Game, where offers of $1.00 or
$2.00 are perceived as unfair, whereas offers of $4.00 or $5.00 are
perceived as fair. Procedural justice prototypes refer to ‘mental
scripts’ of fair or unfair procedures. People can evaluate the fairness of a particular procedure by comparing its elements to their
template of fairness (Ambrose & Kulik, 2001). Interactional justice
prototypes are ‘mental scripts’ of fair or unfair interpersonal treatment. Thus, people form prototypes of ‘fair’ and ‘unfair’ outcomes,
‘fair’ and ‘unfair’ procedures, and ‘fair’ and ‘unfair’ interpersonal
treatment.
These fairness prototypes represent standards, expectations, or
thresholds against which current events are assessed. This indicates that justice or fairness exists when there is congruence between what people expect on the basis of salient or appropriate
normative rule and what they obtain (Cohen & Greenberg, 1982).
Thus, whenever an individual faces a triggering event, he/she
matches this event against existing prototypes. In proposing a neurocognitive model of ethics, Reynolds (2006) suggests that such
matching process helps people to determine whether a given situ-

ation is ethical or unethical. Echoing this line of reasoning, Tabibnia, Satpute, and Lieberman (2008) note that fairness processing
is relatively automatic and intuitive since the ventral striatum,
the amygdala, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have all been
associated with automatic processes (Lieberman, 2007). Thus, fairness judgment is processed in the X-system. People also attach values to those prototypes to the extent that prototypes of fair
outcomes may be more valued than prototypes of unfair outcomes.
As a perceptual phenomenon, fairness is inﬂuenced by prior
recollection and reconstruction. Salancik and Pfeffer (1978) argued
that perception is a retrospective process, and therefore, even
though an employee may experience an immediate event, the
interpretation of that event is derived from prior recall and reconstruction. Thus, employees may compare current events to previous standards of fairness or previous situations of fairness or
unfairness. These recollections may help to determine whether
the event can be construed as fair or unfair. In a study using fMRI,
Tabibnia et al. (2008) found that the ventral striatum, the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were associated with fairness preferences. In
discussing how people make procedural justice judgments, Ambrose and Kulik (2001) contend that the question of how individuals evaluate procedures to form fairness judgments is
fundamentally a cognitive question to the extent that the meaning
given to a particular event will inﬂuence the person’s subsequent
attitudes and behaviors.
However, neuroeconomic evidence suggests that experiencing
fairness may be seen as a pleasurable experience and thus may
activate the nucleus accumbens, whereas experiencing unfairness
may be seen as an unpleasant event that activates the insula
(Camerer et al., 2004). The anterior insula is also activated when
facing situations leading to decisions of fairness or unfairness
(Morse, 2006; Sanfey et al., 2003). Sanfey et al. (2003) found that
unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game activated the insula. They also
noted that heightened activity in anterior insula for rejected unfair
offers suggests an important role for emotions in decision making.
Hsu, Anen, and Quartz (2008) found that the anterior insula encodes inequity. Damasio (1994), Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and
Lee (1999), Pillutla and Murnighan (1996), Hegtvedt and Killian
(1999), Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, and Welch (2001), and
Glimcher, Kable, and Louie (2007) showed that emotions play an
important role in decisions.
The somatic marker hypothesis (Damasio, 1994), according to
which emotional states are triggered in the brain before and after
decision making, could help to explain justice judgments in organizations to the extent that it advocates the view that people learn
that fairness is pleasant and unfairness, unpleasant. The key
assumption of the somatic marker hypothesis is that decision making is a process that is inﬂuenced by marker signals that arise in

bioregulatory processes including those that express themselves
in emotions and feelings (Bechara & Damasio, 2005). The somatic
marker is engrained in the brain because the amygdala triggers
emotional responses to decision outcome experiences, which then
become learned associations expressed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) (Navqi & Bechara, 2006). The neural evidence suggests that the outcome of behavior is determined by
the relative degree of engagement of an emotional response and
processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (Cohen, 2005).
The model of neuro-organizational justice may help to elucidate
several aspects of fairness heuristic theory (e.g., Lind, 2001; Van
den Bos, 2001; Van den Bos, Lind, & Wilke, 2001), and uncertainty
management theory (e.g., Lind & Van den Bos, 2002; Van den Bos &
Lind, 2002). Fairness heuristics theory posits two basic premises.
First, fairness judgments are assumed to serve as a proxy for interpersonal trust in guiding decisions about whether to behave in a
cooperative manner in social institutions. Second, people are assumed to use a variety of cognitive shortcuts to ensure that they
have a fairness judgment available when they need to make decisions about engaging in a cooperative behavior (Lind, 2001).
Uncertainty management theory contends that people rely on fairness information most when they are confronted with uncertainty
(e.g., Lind & Van den Bos, 2002; Van den Bos & Lind, 2002), deﬁned
as the extent to which an individual does not know what to do in a
particular situation or cannot fully assess the implications of the
choice he/she makes or does not understand the event well enough
to predict it (e.g., Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982). The uncertainty management model argues that in the process of forming
justice judgments, people tend to look ﬁrst for justice information
that is most relevant in the particular situation in which they ﬁnd
themselves (Van den Bos, 2007).
Uncertainty management theory relies on two principles: the
substitutability principle and the primacy effect to explain how people form justice judgments. The substitutability effect contends
that because information about outcomes is not often available
but information about procedures is often available, people rely
on the latter to make judgments of fairness concerning their outcomes (Van den Bos & Lind, 2002). The primacy effect suggests that
information which is ﬁrst used to make judgments of fairness
tends to inﬂuence subsequent fairness judgments. Information that
comes ﬁrst exerts a stronger inﬂuence on fairness judgments than
information that comes second (Van den Bos & Lind, 2002). Using
heuristics to make fairness judgments may involve the X-system
to the extent that it frees up cognitive capacity that would otherwise be devoted to trying to assess the requests of the situation
(e.g., Lind, 2001). Thus, it implies an automatic process. Consider
a relationship between an employee and his/her supervisor in
which the former does not have sufﬁcient information about the
trustworthiness of the latter. This lack of information about the

<-----Page 6----->C.D. Beugré / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 129–139

supervisor’s ability to be fair would create an uncertain situation
leading the employee to look for any clue that may provide an indication about the supervisor’s trustworthiness.
Neural basis of justice reactions
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the neural basis of justice reactions includes attitudinal as well as behavioral responses. The attitudinal
component represents the feelings generated by fairness evaluations. People may feel happy, satisﬁed, or committed as a result
of fair treatment or they may be angry, disgusted, or frustrated
as a result of unfair treatment. Such attitudinal responses may
have neural underpinnings as evidenced by the extant research
in neuroeconomics. In a study using fMRI, Tabibnia et al. (2008)
found that the ventral striatum, the amygdala, the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were
associated with fairness preferences. Similarly, Singer et al. (2006)
found that the activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the
nucleus accumbens were correlated with individuals’ subjective
feelings of anger and retribution. These results indicate that being
treated fairly activates the reward regions of the brain and are consistent with previous ﬁndings (e.g., Dickhaut, McCabe, Ngode,
Rustichini, & Pardo, 2003; Sanfey et al., 2003). Dickhaut et al.
(2003) found more activity in the orbitofrontal cortex when thinking about gains compared to losses, and more activity in inferior
parietal and cerebellar areas when thinking about losses. Perceptions of fairness may be construed as gains or pleasant experiences,
whereas perceptions of unfairness may be construed as losses or
unpleasant experiences. Thus, they may activate the same brain
regions.
In a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, Kringelbach and
Rolls (2004) found that activity in the medial parts of the orbitofrontal cortex was related to the monitoring, learning, and memory
of the reward value of reinforcers, whereas activity in the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex was related to the evaluation of punishers. Pillutla and Murnighan (1996) found that anger was a better predictor
of the rejections of unfair offers than perceptions that the offers
were unfair. The authors concluded that emotional reactions provided the critical link that determined when fairness perceptions
affected immediately subsequent behavior. Thus, one may speculate that a wide range of employee attitudes, such as job satisfaction, commitment, identiﬁcation with the organization, and
turnover intentions may have neural underpinnings. These attitudinal responses to fairness or unfairness may often translate into
actual behaviors.
Research in neuroeconomics indicates that human beings may
have a natural aversion for inequity (e.g., Cohen, 2005; Fehr &
Schmidt, 1999; Henrich et al., 2001; Sanfey et al., 2003). This inequity aversion is so strong that people are willing to sacriﬁce personal gains to prevent another person from receiving an
inequitably better outcome (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999). Most neuroeconomics studies that demonstrate this effect used the Ultimate
Game (UG). The Ultimatum Game involves a pair of players who
must split an endowment. One player is given a sum of money,
usually $10.00 that must be split with a partner who may accept
or refuse the offer. If the offer is accepted, each player receives
the amount allocated. If the offer is rejected, neither receives the
allocated amount and the game is terminated. Standard economic
theory would predict that any split that offers an amount greater
than zero should be accepted because any amount of money is
better than nothing. However, several studies using the game
demonstrate that very often, offers of less than 20% are rejected.
Commenting on such ﬁndings, Cohen (2005) notes that rejections
of low offers are driven responses; perhaps, anger at the unfairness
of the offer or pleasure at the thought of punishing someone who
has tried to take advantage. Increased activation of the anterior

135

insula is seen when individuals reject unfair offers, perhaps indicating a higher degree of emotional involvement (Brosnan, 2009).
A common conclusion of such studies is that people are likely to
forego personal gains to punish someone they think has acted
unfairly.
Kahneman, Knestch, and Thaler (1986) and Turillo, Folger,
Lavelle, Umphress, and Gee (2002) provide evidence for such
self-sacriﬁcial behaviors to punish transgressors. Kahneman et al.
(1986) conducted an experiment designed to assess the extent to
which people self-sacriﬁce to punish an unfair allocator. Participants indicated a clear preference to divide $10 evenly with a fair
allocator rather than divide $12 with an unfair allocator. These results imply that participants were willing to self-sacriﬁce (losing
$1) to punish an unfair allocator. Turillo et al. (2002) replicated
Kahneman et al.’s study. Their results supported Kahneman et
al.’s (1986) ﬁndings that people were likely to self-sacriﬁce to punish an unfair allocator. In the ﬁeld of organizational justice, several
studies have demonstrated that feelings of unfairness lead to revenge and retaliatory behavior (e.g., Bies, 1987; Skarlicki & Folger,
1997). Research in neuroeconomics indicates that such behaviors
may have neural underpinnings.
Knoch, Pascual-Leone, Myer, Yreyer, and Fehr (2006) showed
that disruption of the right but not the left, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation substantially reduces participants’ willingness to reject
their partners’ intentionally unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game.
However, the participants still judge such offers as unfair. The
authors interpret these ﬁndings by concluding that the right DLPFC
plays a key role in the implementation of fairness-related behaviors. Fairness also activates the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(VMPFC) (McCabe, Houser, Ryan, Smith, & Trouard, 2001), whereas
unfairness activates the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Decety,
Jackson, Sommerville, Chaminade, & Meltzoff, 2004). Sanfey et al.
(2003) also found that unfair offers activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and accepting unfair offers signiﬁcantly
stimulated the DLPFC than the anterior insula thereby demonstrating that acceptance of an unfair offer placed higher cognitive demands on the individual. De Quervain et al. (2004) and Singer
et al. (2006) found that punishment of an unfair partner increased
activity in the caudate nucleus. Such behavior implies that people
exhibit reciprocal fairness (e.g., Bolton & Ockenfels, 2000; Fehr &
Gächter, 2000; King-Casas et al., 2005). Reciprocity means that in
response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer
and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest
model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal (Fehr & Gächter, 2000,
p. 159). This reciprocity effect perhaps explains the tendency for
respondents to refuse unfair offers more frequently from humans
rather than from computers that do not have intentions (Brosnan,
2009). By attributing intentions to humans, respondents could be
able to include an element of reciprocity involving cooperation in
case of fair treatment and punishment in case of unfair treatment.
Although recipients may acknowledge unfair offers, they may
still decide to accept them. This process involves cognitive efforts.
The right DLPFC and VLPFC are implicated in the cognitive control
of the impulse to reject unfair offers (Fehr, 2009). Thus, they are
crucial to the behavioral implementation of fairness motives.
Tabibnia et al. (2008) found that accepted unfair offers were not
associated with increased activity in the reward regions of the
brain, thereby supporting the interpretation that logical rather
than hedonic processes guided these particular decisions. In fact,
recognizing or evaluating an offer as unfair and deciding to accept
or reject it are two different phenomena. Judging an offer as fair or
unfair may involve the X-system as indicated by Tabibnia et al.
(2008), whereas deciding to accept it or not would entail a more
elaborate process that activates the C-system. In a study using

<-----Page 7----->136

the Ultimatum Game, Pillutla and Murnighan (1996) found that
anger was a better predictor of the rejections than perceptions that
the offers were unfair. The authors concluded that emotional reactions provided the critical link that determined when fairness perceptions affected immediately subsequent behavior.
The neural matrix of organizational justice
The neural matrix of organizational justice refers to the set of
brain structures that are activated by situations of fairness or
unfairness. Neuroeconomic evidence shows that fairness implicates several neural areas including the amygdala, the anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,
and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These neural areas constitute what I labeled the neural matrix of justice or fairness. This
matrix includes brain regions that are involved in both the X-system and the C-system. Thus, Table 3 contrasts brain regions involved in justice as well as in the X- and C-systems. As the table
illustrates, brain regions implicated in fairness are also parts of
the neuroanatomy of the X- and C-systems. For example, the
amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex are involved in
both fairness and the X-system. These two brain regions intervene
in emotional arousal. Thus, one may speculate that by involving regions that represent the X-system, fairness includes an emotional
component. The same is true when one contemplates the role of
brain regions involved in the C-system.
Neuroeconomic evidence shows that brain regions such as the
orbitofrontal cortex, the lateral prefrontal cortex that are involved
in the C-system are also implicated in fairness. Thus, the C-system
is implicated in fairness when participants decide whether to
accept an unfair offer. However, the X-system may intervene when
people must decide whether a particular event is fair or not. The
implication of both the X- and C-system indicates that fairness
involves both cognitions and emotions. ‘‘The neural circuitry of
emotion and cognition interact from early perception to decision
making and reasoning” (Phelps, 2006, p. 28). As indicated by the
model of neuro-organizational justice, the division between cognition and emotion is blurred when attempting to understand the
neural circuitry mediating these classes of behavior (Phelps,
2006). Thus, fairness does not depend exclusively on the X-system
or the C-system both intervene in fairness judgments and reactions. Van den Bos (2007) describes justice judgments as a ‘hot cognitive’ process—meaning cognition colored by feelings, in which
cognitive and affective determinants often work together to produce people’s judgments of what they think is just or unjust.

Discussion/implications
The model of neuro-organizational justice is the ﬁrst of its kind
to address the neural correlates of organizational justice and could
allow organizational justice scholars to look inside the ‘black box’
in explaining employee reactions to fairness and/or unfairness. It
suggests the existence of a neural circuitry involving fairness prototypes and could lay the groundwork for fruitful research avenues
in organizational justice.
Directions for future research
Most research on the neural correlates of fairness in social cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomics has been conducted in
experimental settings. Yet there are important differences between
these settings and the social interactions occurring in the workplace. An interesting question for organizational justice scholars is
to determine whether employees ‘internalize’ fairness standards

learned from their social environment or are these standards innate? One may speculate that although there may be some ‘builtin’ basis for judgments of fairness, the speciﬁcs may be learned from
cultural or work environments. McCabe et al. (2001) argue that humans are biologically endowed to engage in personal exchanges
and Tabibnia et al. (2008) demonstrate that humans are exquisitely
sensitive to fairness. To the extent that such exchanges require
cooperation, fairness and reciprocity, the sense of fairness is an
integral part of organizational life. The quest for justice is part of
a Darwinian algorithm engrained in all of us, to help ensure survival
of the group (Goldman & Thatcher, 2002). However, additional
studies are needed to determine whether fairness is learned or
inherited. Exploring its neural correlates in the workplace may contribute to providing adequate answers to this question.
Another fruitful research avenue is whether different brain
areas are activated when people experience different types of organizational justice? Is reward circuitry in the brain more activated
when people experience distributive justice as compared to procedural and/or interactional justice? Previous studies in neuroeconomics and social cognitive neuroscience have only considered
the fairness of outcomes as indicated in the Ultimatum Game.
Future studies focusing on the neural correlates of organizational
justice could explore the brain areas activated when people contemplate the fairness of formal procedures or interpersonal treatment. Such studies could beneﬁt from forming alliances with the
emerging ﬁelds of neuroeconomics and social cognitive neuroscience. Neuroeconomics research using the Ultimatum Game often
considers the fairness of the offer (distributive justice). No reference is made to the fairness of the process (if any) governing the
offer nor to the quality of the interpersonal relationship between
the players. Because the organizational justice literature contends
that people care not only about the fairness of outcomes but also
the fairness of the process governing the allocation of outcomes
as well as the fairness of interpersonal treatment, future studies
exploring the neural correlates of fairness in organizations should
include such dimensions in the game or other methodologies. For
example, researchers could use a redesigned version of the Ultimatum Game that includes the fairness of the offer, the fairness of the
process underlying the offer and the quality of the interpersonal
relationship between the players. Such a redesigned game may
help to capture the three dimensions of organizational justice.
Organizational justice researchers could also assess whether
justice judgments involve the X-system, while decisions following
perceived fairness and unfairness involve the C-system. Studies
addressing such issues could involve the use of scenarios describing speciﬁc workplace events. For example, participants could be

<-----Page 8----->C.D. Beugré / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 129–139

asked to recall incidents of fair and unfair treatment while their
brains are being scanned. They could also be asked to evaluate
the degree of fairness of scenarios including speciﬁc work events.
Finally, participants could be asked to explore the various decisions
they would take when analyzing these scenarios. Knowledge
gleaned from such studies could help to determine the role of speciﬁc brain regions in justice judgments and reactions to situations
of fairness and/or unfairness in organizational settings.
A caveat of such studies, however, is that organizational life is
based on repeated interactions. Thus, perceptions of fairness and
subsequent feelings toward perpetrators of unfairness occur over
an extended period of time. They are not generally a one-shot deal.
How then does the brain adapt to these circumstances? Could the
concept of neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience play a role in this process? If mere thoughts alter the physical structure and function of
the brain, then one needs not experience injustice or witness it to
activate corresponding brain areas. Just thinking about injustice
one had suffered in the hands of an abusive supervisor may sufﬁce
to ‘light up’ these brain areas. The ‘rumination’ of past injustices
may activate corresponding brain regions. Organizational justice
scholars do not know yet what a prolonged exposure to abusive
supervision might have on the human brain. Likewise, the anticipation of injustice (anticipatory injustice) may also activate speciﬁc
brain regions. Shapiro and Kirkman (2001) contend that expecting
injustice is a negative expectation and thus very similar to fear. As
such, anticipating injustice may activate the amygdala to the
extent that it is construed as fear or loss. Such issues warrant
further empirical and/or experimental studies.
A neuroscientiﬁc approach could pave the way for assessing the
neural basis of gender differences found in the organizational justice literature. Singer et al. (2006) found increased activity in the
ventral striatum—a reward region of the brain when men but not
women watched unfair proposers receive punishment. These gender-related differences may be explained in two ways. First, women are better coders and decoders of nonverbal communication
(Hall, 1978; Henley, 1995). Second, estrogen, a hormone found
abundantly in women, initiates a neurophysiological process that
allows the brain to develop more complex representations of
how different stimuli relate to different outcomes (Lieberman,
2000). McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, and Gross (2008) conducted an fMRI study designed to assess men and women’s reactions when faced with cognitive regulation. The authors found
that compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater
decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional
responding and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions,
which are associated with reward processing. The authors
explained these ﬁndings by suggesting that men may expend less
effort when using cognitive regulation, perhaps due to greater
use of automatic emotion regulation. They also found that women
may use positive emotions in service of reappraising negative emotions to a greater degree. These gender differences may be used to
explain cognitive regulation mechanisms related to perceptions of
unfairness. Perhaps, men and women may use different mechanisms when trying to cognitively regulate negative emotions that
can be elicited by perceptions of unfairness.
Knowledge about the role of brain regions in organizational justice cannot advance without sound experimental and/or empirical
studies. To this end, organizational justice scholars should explore
the different techniques that could help garner knowledge in this
area. The following four techniques already used in neuroeconomics and social cognitive neuroscience could help to analyze the role
of speciﬁc brain regions in perceptions of fairness in organizational
settings. They include Electro-encephalogram (EEG), Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography

137

(MEG), and Position Emission Tomography (PET). Some of these
techniques, such as EEG and MEG measure electromagnetic activity of the brain, whereas others, such as PET and fMRI are sensitive
to changes of cerebral blood ﬂow or metabolism (Kenning & Plassmann, 2005). These techniques have both advantages and disadvantages. ‘‘While the ‘where’ of brain activity is more easily
assessed by fMRI and PET, the question of ‘when’—meaning the discrimination between parallel and sequencing processing can be
more precisely answered by EEG and MEG” (Kenning & Plassmann,
2005, p. 345).
Although these techniques could help to garner valuable information about the role of the brain in organizational justice, they
are somehow limited to the extent that they use reverse inference
in which a particular mental process is inferred from the activation
of a speciﬁc brain region. Reverse inference reasons backward from
the presence of brain activation to the engagement of a particular
cognitive function (Poldrack, 2006). Although the strength of
reverse inference is the degree to which the region of interest is
selectively activated by the cognitive process of interest, the inferences drawn are not deductively valid (Poldrack, 2006). Thus,
researchers could be well advised to follow Tabibnia and Lieberman’s (2007) recommendations. ‘‘Because each brain region is involved in more than one process, we cannot conﬁdently infer from
the observation of increased signal in a region that activity in that region evoked one mental process rather than another. However, our
conﬁdence in the reverse inference could be increased in two ways:
(a) convergence of evidence from multiple techniques and (b) activation in two or more regions thought to underlie the same mental processes, particularly if those regions are known to work together in a
network” (Tabibnia & Lieberman, 2007, pp. 93–94). Research
addressing the questions posed and the techniques described earlier
could help to improve management practice.
Implications for practice
The model of neuro-organizational justice could provide practical implications insofar that it indicates that fairness is ‘engrained’
in the human mind. Thus, one may speculate about the ‘fairness
mind’ to refer to the extent to which human beings are endowed
to be sensitive to fair treatment and to express a natural disgust
for unfair treatment although they may be less sensitive to beneﬁcial inequity—when they get more than they deserve. Although this
assumption is not groundbreaking, it ﬁnds new meaning when it is
substantiated by neural evidence. One implication of this assumption is for managers to acknowledge the importance of fairness as a
fundamental human ‘need’. Thus, they could develop ‘a fairness
theory of mind’ that could prove useful in the creation of fair working environments. This fairness theory of mind is derived from the
theory of mind (e.g., Rilling, Sanfey, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen
2004).
Such a theory could have practical implications and include
three key principles: (a) employees care about fairness, (b) fairness
in the workplace is rewarding in itself, and (c) employees have a
natural disgust for unfairness so much so that they may take all
necessary actions to redress a perceived injustice. Incorporating
these principles could help managers to enhance their sensitivity
to act fairly and understand the types of thoughts, feelings, and
emotions their own behaviors could elicit in the mind of their
employees. Understanding others is a key component of the theory
of mind (e.g., Lieberman, 2007; Rilling et al., 2004) and could help
managers to improve their interpersonal skills. As Rilling et al.
(2004) put it, ‘‘one of the distinctive attributes of human cognition
is our propensity to build models of other minds: to make inferences about states of others” (p. 1694). Representing other people’s
states and goals happens mostly automatically and without awareness (Singer, 2009). This fairness theory of mind could also include

<-----Page 9----->138

C.D. Beugré / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 129–139

the two components identiﬁed by Lieberman (2007): (a) the recognition that people have minds with thoughts and feelings, and (b)
the development of a theory regarding how other people’s minds
operate and respond to events in their environment (p. 263).
The model of neuro-organizational justice could also help managers to better understand the neural underpinnings of their own
decisions. ‘‘We do know that a desire to retaliate, to punish others’
bad behavior, however, mild, even at personal cost, can skew decision making” (Morse, 2006, p. 48). Therefore, when they are emotionally aroused because of speciﬁc circumstances, managers
should delay critical decisions or seek valuable inputs from others.
Understanding oneself is also an important element of the ‘fairness
theory of mind’. In fact, it is a prerequisite for controlling oneself.
This includes reﬂecting on one’s own behaviors and their impact
on others. Several brain areas may be involved in the theory of
mind. Gallagher and Frith (2003) demonstrated that the anterior
paracingulate cortex was activated when people mentalized about
their thoughts or beliefs and those of others as well. Brain structures involved in theory of mind include the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the temporoparietal junctions (TPJ), the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the temporal poles (TP) (Singer,
2009). The medial prefrontal cortex may be concerned with anticipating what a person is going to think and feel and thereby predict
how he/she will react (Frith & Frith, 2006).
Another guideline for management practice that the model
could provide is in helping to alter ‘undesirable’ fairness prototypes. Employees arrive in organizations with deeply rooted fairness prototypes. Some of these previously held prototypes may
not be in congruence with the organizational fairness prototypes.
Because prototypes can be altered, organizations should create
conditions that facilitate the modiﬁcation of such prototypes. By
telling employees the new and espoused organizational prototypes, managers could help them align their individual prototypes
to that of the organization. To this end, managers should reward
the display of desirable behaviors. Such actions could help employees to display the shared prototypes, those that are prevailing in
the organization while avoiding the undesirable ones.
Conclusions
The model of neuro-organizational justice is part of a nascent
body of knowledge on the biological basis of management (e.g,
Coates, 2003; Heaphy & Dutton, 2008; Lee & Chamberlain, 2007;
Morse, 2006; Tabibnia & Lieberman, 2007; Taggart, Robey, & Kroeck, 1985). As such, it should be considered as a work in progress
rather than a ﬁnished product. Thus, the model could help to spark
future studies on the neural correlates of organizational justice.
This is particularly important because a science of human life that
ignores the brain is akin to a study of the solar system that leaves
out the sun (White, 1992). To the extent that perceptions of fairness are endemic to people’s experience in organizations, their
study is part of what White calls the science of human life. It is
my hope that the present model contribute to the development
of a new paradigm in the study of organizational justice.
