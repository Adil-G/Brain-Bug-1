The Transfer and Commercialization of
University-Developed Medical Imaging
Technology: Opportunities and Problems
Anthony A. del Campo, Andrew Sparks, Robert C. Hill, and Robert T. Keller

Abstract— Superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQUID’s) are sensitive devices designed to measure very weak
magnetic fields. The noninvasive nature of these devices makes
them ideal in clinical applications for the measurement of
biomagnetic signals associated with the human body, such as the
brain and the heart. Commercial acceptance of this technology,
however, has been hindered by technical limitations and high
operational costs. Moreover, the advanced medical instrument
market is uncertain as a result of health care reform and the
related pressures of cost containment. The aging U.S. population,
however, will likely increase the demand for cardiovascular
care and thereby present opportunities for SQUID medical
instruments. This paper discusses a university-based attempt to
transfer and commercialize technology that potentially could
eliminate the technical limitations of SQUID devices and allow
their use in typical clinical environments. At this point in the
development process, this technology can be termed neither
a success nor a failure. Based on the experiences thus far,
however, certain lessons can be drawn for technology transfer
of university-developed medical technologies. First, universities
need to re-examine the issue of the incentives to publish versus
the incentives to protect intellectual property. Failure to properly
align these incentives is likely to weaken or eliminate the potential
for a strong intellectual-property position. Second, although
a number of technology-transfer strategies are potentially
available to universities, three factors are critical in making this
selection: 1) the strength of proprietary position; 2) the stage of
development; and 3) the breadth of potential applications for
the technology. Moreover, university technology-transfer offices
need to take a businesslike approach in identifying appropriate
technology-transfer strategies that match the technology, the
marketplace, and commercialization potential.
For universities seeking to commercialize medical technologies
it is critical to expand collaborations with medical professionals
to validate the clinical application of the technology. Finally,
where possible, partnerships with medical device companies
should be pursued to gain experience in product development.
Index Terms— Technology transfer, university commercialization.

NIVERSITIES do the lion’s share of basic research in the
United States. Funding for their research, however, has
been increasingly shifting from the federal government to state

and industrial sources [42]. As federal funds become more
scarce, universities face pressures to obtain revenues from
their research activities by transferring and commercializing
technologies developed by faculty and others, often through
alliances with commercial firms [43]. Data suggest that academic–industry partnerships are on the rise. The Association
of University Technology Managers (AUTM) annual survey
for fiscal 1995 reported industry-sponsored research reached
nearly $20 billion with an 8% average annual change since
1991 [46]. These additional research dollars help to support
university efforts to develop innovative technologies in an
era of decreasing funding from the public sector. Conversely,
the increasingly price-competitive marketplace has motivated
industry to source cutting-edge technologies from universities
rather than rely on internally funded research in order to save
time and money [47]. Universities are especially appealing to
industry as sources of medical and health care research because
the medical field tends to be technology driven.
While the motivation is clear, and the opportunities for
universities are considerable, major obstacles still exist. Most
difficult among these obstacles is the fact that most universities
have changed neither their core activities in discipline-based
science and engineering nor the associated incentive systems.
University expertise in basic research is generally strong, but
skills in development and basic business tend to be weak.
As a result, boundary-spanning units have been created at the
periphery to enhance technology transfer [45]. Universities,
moreover, do not have products nor do they have a line of
sight to a customer; hence, efforts to commercialize technology
usually lack focus and experience-based learning [44].
Until recently, universities by and large have had limited
success when it comes to commercializing technology. Many
universities still struggle with a number of issues involved in
commercializing new technologies. One of the major issues is
a conflict of incentives. Professional advancement of faculty
(both within the university and within the given discipline)
requires timely publication of research and scientific discoveries. Unfortunately, timely publication of this research can also
endanger critical components of intellectual property. Within
scientific disciplines, the rewards for being first to publish are
much less ambiguous than the rewards of commercialization.
As a result, inventors may forfeit the ability to protect the
proprietary position of a technology in the rush to publish.
Other major issues include the legal complexities of disputes
over technology ownership and unclear university policies in

handling intellectual property [41]. Nonetheless, universities
appear determined to learn from their mistakes and to become
successful at technology transfer and commercialization. Over
the past five years, universities have demonstrated a growing proficiency in technology-transfer activities. More than
10 000 licenses were executed between academic institutions
and private industry over a five-year period between 1991
and 1995. This number represents a cumulative change of
68% [46]. Moreover, these licenses are generating significant
royalty dollars. Over $425 million in royalties and licensing
fees were received by universities in 1995 [46].
This growth in licensing activity is likely to continue
as academic technology-transfer offices gain experience in
conducting their activities in a business like manner.
In this paper, we investigate an attempt by a major university to transfer and commercialize a shielding technology,
developed in a university physics department, for use in
advanced experimental medical imaging instruments using
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) technology. This pursuit is still in progress. As a result of several
operational problems discussed later in more detail, SQUID’s
have not yet achieved widespread clinical use. The innovative
shielding technology described in this paper reflects one of the
attempts to address the problems associated with commercial
use of SQUID-based medical instruments. The challenge for
this university is to decide on an appropriate technologytransfer strategy to increase the potential for commercialization
and the financial return on the university’s intellectual property. In this paper, we examine the technology, the target
industry, the steps taken toward commercialization thus far,
and the university’s options for completing technology transfer
of this invention. By examining the process and problems of
this effort, we can learn about the opportunities and pitfalls
that might face other universities and research labs that are
interested in the commercialization of medical technologies.
In addition, we can develop better practices for success.

II. TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
SQUID’s are sensitive instruments designed to measure very
weak magnetic fields. The active element of a SQUID is one
or more Josephson junctions connected to a superconducting
loop. This Josephson junction, when operated at the appropriate critical superconducting temperature, can support current
flow and is very sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields.
For additional information about SQUID technology, Wikswo
[1] provides an excellent review of current SQUID technology.
Low-Tc (low temperature Celsius) SQUID’s use superconducting materials that must be cooled to liquid helium temperatures
(approximately 212 C) while high-Tc SQUID’s incorporate
new superconducting materials that allow operating at higher
liquid nitrogen temperatures ( 196 C or higher). Since the
first report in 1970 [2] demonstrated that SQUID technology
could measure the biomagnetic fields created by the human
heart, these extremely sensitive sensors have steadily improved
beyond the research stage into commercial applications. Thus
far, however, research institutions and universities remain the
primary market for this industry.

III. BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
The extreme sensitivity of SQUID’s make them ideal for
applications in medicine as instruments for noninvasive and
contactless investigation of biomagnetic fields, such as those
associated with the brain, heart, and other muscles. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) records the very low magnetic
signal generated by the millions of nerve cells constituting the
brain. Several clinical reports suggest that MEG is very useful
in diagnosing neurological disease as well as for the general
study of brain function [48]–[50].
The other major biomedical application of SQUID is magnetocardiography (MCG). MCG detects the electrical activity of
the heart by recording the magnetic field generated as a result
of the innervation of the cardiac muscle. Clinical research
studies using MCG for both fetal and adult applications are
numerous and have demonstrated the ability of MCG to
measure the signal of a beating heart [4], [28], [29]. Most of
these clinical reports focus on the use of MCG for the study of
conduction disorders and have shown that MCG is at least as
accurate as electrocardiogram (ECG) in mapping the sites of
cardiac arrhythmias [30], [31]. These clinical reports suggest
that MCG could serve as an alternative monitoring tool for the
catheter-assisted removal of abnormal sites of conduction, i.e.,
cardiac ablation. SQUID’s have also been used experimentally
to monitor the fetal heart. In contrast to traditional ECG
methods using electrodes, fetal magnetocardiogram (FMCG)
records the fetal cardiac signal in a contactless manner and
with virtually no interference from the maternal heart [5].
Existing alternative methods, such as ultrasound, yield mainly
anatomical information, while electrophysiologic activity must
be inferred [51]. Thus, though it is still in the developmental
stage, FMCG has the potential to provide very useful clinical
information in a noninvasive manner—something not yet
offered by competing technologies.
Despite the clinical promise of SQUID devices, both MEG
and MCG are encumbered with operational limitations that
are cost prohibitive. Although MEG instruments are commercially available for diagnostic use, wider clinical acceptance
of SQUID technology has been hindered by the need for
expensive magnetically shielded rooms to reduce background
magnetic noise. Thus, it is likely for the foreseeable future
that the high potential cost and complexity of MCG will cause
SQUID developers to focus on advanced clinical applications
rather than routine heart-rate measurement. Health care reform
and consequent cost consciousness of both private and government insurers require developers of new medical technology to
show a cost benefit. Improvements in shielding technology to
limit the SQUID’s sensitivity to background noise, however,
could, potentially, establish the commercial feasibility of these
devices.
IV. STATUS OF THE PROPOSED UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY
University researchers sought to improve the high-Tc
SQUID magnetometers so that such devices could be operated
in clinical environments outside a shielded room. To this
end, the university researchers developed a novel shielding
technology for the SQUID device enabling it to measure

<-----Page 2----->DEL CAMPO et al.: TRANSFER AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

electrical activity of the heart without the costly requirement
of a shielded room. Such an improvement in operational
requirements should greatly increase the demand for SQUIDbased instrumentation.
The shielding technology involves designing localized highTc superconducting shields to screen out selectively background magnetic noise without affecting the fields of interest,
such as those emanating from cardiac sources. Toward this
end, magnetic shields of various shapes were designed and
fabricated from superconducting materials or mu-metals that
would be placed around the SQUID sensor. These shields
effectively block out unwanted magnetic noise and improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. Details of this technology have been
formally described in a university invention disclosure.
The success of the shielding technology encouraged the
researchers to develop their own two-channel prototype MCG
system to measure the biomagnetic signal from the human
heart. This prototype has been used to measure successfully
the typical cardiac signal from a human subject in a completely unshielded environment at a major hospital. Additional
research has focused on reducing other ambient noise sources
such those from power line, RF interference, Earth’s magnetic
field, and others in an effort to achieve a cleaner signal. The
current prototype uses electronic components and equipment
that cost a total of approximately $40 000. The system also
included digital signal processing boards and electronics and
a specially designed gantry. Although the basic system was
not unlike other designs that have been described in the scientific literature, the key component of the prototype was the
university-developed superconducting shields. The estimated
cost of the prototype suggests that a commercial production
version would not be prohibitively expensive, relative to other
sophisticated medical instrumentation. Estimates indicated that
the cost of a marketable unit could be less than $100 000.
This cost would allow production and sale of a reasonably
priced unit relative to other sophisticated commercial medical
devices. The relatively low estimated cost encouraged the
university to consider developing a fully integrated system
for commercialization. A significant amount of additional
development, however, would be required to produce a commercially suitable unit.
V. THE UNIVERSITY’S PROPRIETARY POSITION
Although the invention had been disclosed to the appropriate
offices of the university, a patent application for the background noise shielding has not been formally filed in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). A patentability opinion,
moreover, had not been conducted to determine whether patent
protection could be obtained. A cursory review of the prior
art, though neither exhaustive nor definitive, suggests that
getting such a patent opinion is imperative. According to patent
law, an invention must differ significantly from any publicly
known technical knowledge found in the patent literature or
elsewhere. Furthermore, the invention cannot be an obvious
modification of a previous technology. Should related patents
exist, marketing a new SQUID-based device for biomedical
applications might be considered infringement. This situation

291

could present a barrier to entry and would have relevance to
the university’s wish to be an independent developer of MCG.
VI. INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
The medical device industry is currently in the midst
of an upheaval due to the uncertainties brought on by the
potential for health reform and accelerated managed care
penetration. Overall cost-containment efforts have changed
the way buyers of medical care view new technologies and
in turn have modified the competitive strategies that medical
device companies pursue. The formulation of these strategies
is dependent on a variety of forces, including the availability of
funds, the reactions of users and regulators, and general market
trends [6]. Potential entrants into the medical device industry
must pay close attention to both the macro-environment and
the industry environment that collectively impact competition
within the industry. The macro-environment includes those
outside influences that are often out of the control of the
individual firms within the industry. On the other hand,
the industry environment comprises the competitive forces
existing within the medical device industry.
VII. MACRO-ENVIRONMENT
A. Government Regulation
Perhaps no other industry in the United States is more
regulated than the medical device industry. Government policy impacts the medical device industry through Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) regulation and the level of reimbursement for procedures involving medical devices under Medicare/Medicaid programs. These policies can have
a significant bearing on the time to market depending on
the type of approval that must be obtained. Products that
are “substantially equivalent” to an earlier, legally marketed
device can obtain clearance through a premarket notification or
510(K). These products tend to be incremental innovations—a
common characteristic of device development. In contrast,
products approved through a premarket approval (PMA) are
not substantially equivalent to an earlier device and represent
greater potential risk to patients. Currently, marketing approval
for a typical 510(K) may take from three to four months, while
the PMA process, requiring clinical trials, can take as long as
two to five years [8]. This already difficult process could be
made even more onerous if some newly proposed changes in
regulation are approved. These potential regulatory changes
would broaden the regulatory scope of the FDA to include
the right to examine cost-effectiveness claims of new devices
[9] and would place additional pressures on manufacturers to
evaluate new technologies more closely before embarking on
costly development programs.
B. Health Care Reform
It is safe to say that a fair amount of uncertainty exists
about the extent and nature of any potential health care reform
in the offing. The government, as a major insurer through
the Medicare/Medicaid programs, and private insurers have

<-----Page 3----->292

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, VOL. 46, NO. 3, AUGUST 1999

become sensitive to the escalating cost of medical care. There
is a widely held belief that technological change, particularly
through its influence on medical devices, is the principal
culprit to the rising costs of medical care [10]. Some analysts
suggest that new technologies account for more than 50% of
the total rise in real medical care costs after inflation [1].
Obviously, these views instill a sense of suspicion of new
technology in the eyes of insurers and put additional pressure
on device companies to demonstrate cost benefits of new
medical technologies. Greater use of managed care will further
increase the pressure to control costs by limiting access to expensive procedures. Capital budget committees are expanding
the scope of their operations to include technology assessment
to evaluate whether health outcomes can be measured and
linked to specific technologies [9].
These new pressures brought on by health care reform
will likely generate additional challenges for the medical
device industry. The industry will be forced to be concerned
about cost/benefit analysis early in the development of new
technologies. For most technologies, the key to success in
securing public and private insurers’ support for a new device
will be the ability to back up claims of clinical efficacy, safety,
and cost effectiveness. The development of an MCG device
will be subject to similar pressures to demonstrate a cost
benefit.
C. Demand for New Medical Technologies
Despite the uncertainty of health care reform and the need
for cost containment, the demand for innovative medical devices should continue. Historically, America has demonstrated
a commitment to medical innovation that is more deeply rooted
than its commitment to cost containment [12]. On a more
intangible level, the American public has immense hope in
the promise of medical research and a deep reluctance to
risk the slowing of innovation in the biomedical industry.
In addition, the aging of the baby boom generation and its
parents should create continuous demand for new technologies in cardiovascular care, the segment of the market that
would be served by MCG. In 1993, 3% of the total U.S.
cardiovascular-related expenditures, or $3.5 billion, was spent
on cardiovascular medical devices. This market segment has
grown steadily over the years and the trend is expected to
continue as the U.S. population ages [13].
VIII. INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT
The medical device industry faces a significant degree of
uncertainty in the short term. The following is a discussion of
key issues of competition within this industry.
A. Barriers to Entry
A number of significant barriers to entry exist in developing
new medical technology. One of the fundamental barriers
is proprietary position. For a new medical technology to be
valuable, ownership of a proprietary technology must be clear
and fit within a narrow market segment. A strong proprietary
position within a market reduces the risk of new competitors
entering the market segment and provides some assurance

of long-term market presence. The capital requirements to
develop a new medical device has increased substantially
over the last three years and has discouraged many would
be competitors. It has been estimated that it costs between
$25–$75 million to bring a major new medical device to
market [16]. In addition, new entrants face the daunting
prospect of securing start-up capital from investors who are
resistant to fund new medical devices due to an uncertainty
about the effect of health reform proposals on the demand
for expensive technologies, as well as expanded requirements
for FDA medical device approval [7]. In short, the economic
impact of higher costs of device development and the greater
marketplace risk translate into higher hurdle rates for investors.
For many device manufacturers, overcoming the FDA approval bottleneck is the greatest obstacle to bringing a new
product to market. The approval process has been notoriously
slow and expensive. Device manufacturers generally prefer
the 510(K) approval process since products do not need to
undergo clinical trials and thus a quicker time to market.
In contrast, PMA’s can take several years because products
must go through clinical trials to test safety and efficacy, thus
adding to pre-market commercialization costs. The probability
of successful approval is not high; far more applications
are rejected than are approved [18]. Even if the product
is granted FDA approval, the company has little chance of
commercial success unless it can convince both public and
private health insurers to pay for it. In the current climate
of health care reform, insurance reimbursement has become
increasingly difficult unless there is a clear cost benefit associated with the medical procedure. Insurance companies and
government Medicare/Medicaid programs are now considering
the adoption of diagnostic outcome studies to assess the costs
and results of patient treatment against the costs of different
tests used to detect a disease [20]. Insurance companies
have already started a practice known as capitation, whereby
managed care plans pay health care providers a fixed amount
to care for a patient over a given period. Providers are not
reimbursed for services that exceed the allotted amount [22].
It is, therefore, necessary to conduct comparative analyses,
backed with solid data, to demonstrate the cost benefits of a
new technology relative to existing technology.
B. Market Dynamics
Two major factors will affect demand for products and
services in the medical device industry. First, if health care
reform does occur, it could have a major if uncertain impact
Second, America’s population is living longer and the baby
boom generation is entering the age group where health care
expenditures are the greatest. This second factor impacts the
cardiovascular segment of health care the most since cardiovascular disease represents the principal cause of death in the
United States and bodes well for cardiovascular diagnostic
devices such as MCG [13].
C. Market Opportunities
The MCG device would primarily target the cardiovascular market, one of the most important health care markets.

<-----Page 4----->DEL CAMPO et al.: TRANSFER AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

According to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular
disease is the principle cause of death in the United States, with
over 900 000 deaths each year [13]. Cardiovascular diseaserelated expenditures are a major health care expense in the
United States, totaling $115 billion in 1993 or 12% of the
total U.S. spending on health care. Moreover, approximately
3% of cardiovascular disease expenditures, or $3.45 billion,
relates to the purchase of medical devices.
In the past 10–15 years there have been several studies in
the medical research literature that demonstrate the clinical
potential of MCG in both fetal and adult applications [4],
[26]–[29]. Commercial success, however, remains doubtful
until developers of MCG can show cost effective utility that
goes beyond simple heart monitoring. Other widely available
and well understood technologies such as ultrasound (echocardiogram) and ECG are routinely used to monitor heart rate.
The real opportunity of SQUID-based medical devices resides
in their ability to localize noninvasively abnormal bioelectrical
activity in the fetal and adult heart, as well as other innervated
muscle tissues such as the small intestine. Further, the risk
of commercialization can be reduced by building instruments
with a common design to allow usage for different biomagnetic
applications within different markets. These applications are
discussed below.

IX. DIAGNOSIS OF CARDIAC RHYTHM
AND CONDUCTION DISORDERS
The beating of the heart muscle is controlled through a complex network of nerves that generate weak electrical current,
resulting in weak magnetic fields suitable for measurement by
MCG. Many clinical research studies have investigated the use
of MCG to study patients with cardiac conduction disorders
[26], [28], [30], [31]. Conduction disorders are characterized
as deviations in the normal rhythm of the beating heart, also
known as cardiac arrhythmias, and are due to abnormal cardiac
electrical activity. An arrhythmia occurs when the heart’s
natural pacemaker develops an abnormal rhythm, or when the
normal conduction pathway is interrupted. Rapid heart beat, or
tachycardia, is the most common form of rhythm disorder [13].
A relatively new and growing cardiology subspecialty called
cardiac electrophysiology concentrates on the anatomic and
physiologic factors involved with the control and conduction
of the electrical activity in the heart. Traditionally, patients
with suspected rhythm disorders are evaluated through external
monitoring by use of ECG. Electrophysiologists then use this
information to localize roughly sites of electrical conduction
abnormalities within the heart tissue. The precise location of
these sites are confirmed by stimulating and recording intracardiac electrical activity at a number of sites with diagnostic
catheters guided into the heart through arteries and veins. The
abnormal sites are imaged concurrently with x-ray fluoroscopy,
and the resulting information enables the electrophysiologist
to determine the appropriate course of action. Treatment may
include destroying the site of abnormal conduction through a
process known as catheter ablation [32].
Several clinical studies have focused on using MCG to
localize initially sites of abnormal electrical conduction in

293

the heart as an alternative to EGG. Because ECG measures
potential differences at the body surface, it is highly influenced
by the nonhomogeneous conductivities of the different layers
of tissue and can result in inaccurate localizations of electrical
conduction in the heart. In contrast, the contactless MCG
remains mostly uninfluenced by the electrical properties of
the tissues between the source and the sensors [33]. Many
researchers have reported a higher sensitivity of the MCG
as compared to the ECG in the detection of some forms
of tachycardias [1], [3], [4], [26], [27]. Thus, it has been
suggested that invasive cardiac ablation procedures can be
shortened by MCG, thereby reducing the exposure of x-ray
radiation imaging and the overall cost of the procedure.
Arrhythmias represented 7% of all cardiovascular diseases
in 1993. Arrhythmias can be fatal, with approximately 40 000
deaths reported in 1991 [13]. Overall, it is estimated that
almost four million Americans have some form of arrhythmia.
In addition, over 40 000 catheter ablation procedures were
performed in the United States in 1993 [32]. Catheter ablation procedures can be expensive, typically costing between
$12 000 and $20 000 [32]. Thus, the cardiac electrophysiology
market may present the most immediate opportunity for MCG
as a means to reduce the overall cost of procedures to treat
conduction disorders.
A. Fetal Heart Monitoring
Accurate monitoring of the fetal heart has traditionally
been a medical challenge to physicians, particularly during
the period of gestation prior to the onset of labor. The
insulating effect of the skin-like membrane (vernix caseosa)
covering the fetus as well as the contributing signal of the
maternal heart complicates fetal electrocardiograms (FECG)
when abdominal surface electrodes are used [34]. Therefore,
FECG has been largely discarded in favor of Doppler ultrasound [35]. Although it has been suggested that MCG is
applicable to fetal heart monitoring, commercialization for this
application appears unlikely in light of ultrasound’s ease of
use and sufficient accuracy for routine fetal heart monitoring.
Alternatively, SQUID technology may be more appropriate as
a diagnostic tool to detect fetal heart conduction disorders, an
application not feasible with ultrasound.
B. Diagnosis of Gastrointestinal Disorders
A device essentially similar to the MCG has also been used
for the measurement of gastrointestinal current sources, known
as the magnetoenterogram (MENG) [36]. MENG is based
on the observation that a specific type of electrical activity
associated with the gut known as basic electrical rhythm (BER)
can deviate as a result of certain disease conditions. Further,
levels of BER are known to be specific for a given smooth
muscle source, i.e., the stomach, small intestine, large intestine,
etc. Such specificity potentially allows a physician to localize
the disease portion of the gastrointestinal system. Experimental
studies have demonstrated that MENG can detect decreases in
EER associated with intestinal ischemia, a particularly fatal
disease [36], [37]. These studies suggest that MENG may be

<-----Page 5----->294

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, VOL. 46, NO. 3, AUGUST 1999

a clinically useful approach to the noninvasive detection of
disease of the gut such as intestinal ischemia.

XI. POTENTIAL COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGIES

C. Competitive Analysis
Many research institutions around the world are actively
studying MCG and other SQUID-based instrumentation. The
level of interest can be gauged by the significant number of
articles found in the scientific literature. These studies include
both basic research on the SQUID sensor as well as applied research in pursuit of improved biomedical applications.
Although academic research generally involves noncommercial investigations, the abundance of research studies is an
indication of the extent of the strong competition at the
professional level. Such competition is frequently a prelude to
commercialization. Many of the scientists working on SQUID
technologies have consulting relationships with commercial
SQUID companies. Only a few companies are active in the
development of biomagnetic devices industry within North
America. Of these, it appears that less than four have the capability to progress to the stage of introducing end-user products
to measure and analyze biomagnetic functions such as MEG
and MCG. The remaining firms, in general, act as suppliers
of superconducting components such as SQUID sensors and
control electronics. MCG is not now commercially available,
while a 148-channel, whole head MEG is marketed for approximately $2.0 million. Interestingly, this device obtained
FDA 510K approval because it was determined that MEG was
“substantially equivalent to EEG.” This fact bodes well for the
commercialization of other magnetic source imaging devices
in the future. MCG could also receive abbreviated approval
since this device is similar in operated to MEG. No company
has of yet filed for market clearance for an MCG device.
A few companies, however, are apparently in the process of
developing an MCG. Thus, competition at the market level is
currently nonexistent within the United States. Sales for the
one device that is on the market, however, have been very
slow, reflecting the reluctance of the market to embrace new
technology that lacks demonstrated cost effectiveness.
X. SUMMARY OF

monitoring devices will probably, at least initially, only target
very specific segments of the cardiac market.

THE

MARKET EVALUATION

It would appear that the commercial success of MCG, and
SQUID devices in general, is dependent on eliminating the
operational limitations that currently preclude their use in
clinical environments. It is also important that these devices
are competitively priced and demonstrate cost effectiveness
relative to existing medical technologies. The medical device
marketplace is currently not receptive to premium priced
technology that does not significantly improve the information
already available from proven medical devices. Eliminating the
need for a shielded room would be to be a major step in reducing the costs associated with SQUID-based instrumentation.
The shielding technology discussed here has the capability of
eliminating the need for shielded rooms. This capability would
mitigate the stringent operational requirements for the typical
MCG. The marketability of SQUID-based instrumentation,
however, is not likely to be significant until a clear clinical
benefit can be demonstrated. Even then, SQUID-based heart

Several options are available to commercialize technologies
such as the MCG: licensing; corporate partnerships; and formation of a start-up company. The strategy that is pursued
will depend on several factors, such as: 1) the strength of the
proprietary position; 2) the extent to which this proprietary
position can serve other technology markets; and 3) whether
the technology holder possesses the core competencies needed
to develop the technology into marketable products. These
factors, in general, define the value of the technology and
the risk that the owner of the intellectual property should take
in the commercialization effort. As discussed in the industry
analysis section, medical device developers have significant
barriers to entry. Any potential approach to commercialization
must take these barriers into account. It is our view that
some of these approaches to commercialization are generally
more feasible than others. The following discussion will briefly
summarize the most likely approaches available to a university
in bringing a new medical technology to the market.
A. Licensing
Licensing may be the best strategy when the proprietary position of the intellectual property is narrow or unpatentable and
when the capabilities of the developer are limited. It should be
noted that the owners of the licensed intellectual property, by
definition, generally lose control over the commercialization of
the technology, and that licensee will commonly have future
rights to improvements in the technology. This drawback, of
course, is commensurate with the lower risk confronting the
owner of the technology. Licensing is the most common form
of technology transfer. In this form of transfer, the institution
(licensor) owning the technology or intellectual property grants
a company (licensee) the right to commercialize the intellectual property. The licensee will develop, manufacture, and sell
products pursuant to a formal license agreement between the
licensee and licensor. In effect, the licensor is transferring
the technology, or rights to the technology, to the licensee in
return for some financial remuneration such as royalties and
other fees. The license option often yields the lowest return
to the owner of the technology. Nonetheless, it is frequently
the preferred approach because the risk to the university is
the lowest.
B. Sponsored Research Funding
A university may seek to establish a partnership or sponsored research relationship with a company or funding organization. This approach could be pursued as an alternative to,
or in conjunction with, licensing. Sponsored research is often
required in the early stages of technological development as a
means of making the technology more suitable to a potential
licensee. Companies are often willing to provide some funding
for sponsored research early in the development process in
return for some future rights to the intellectual property. This
strategy usually involves granting the sponsor a first option to

<-----Page 6----->DEL CAMPO et al.: TRANSFER AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

license rights to a limited scope of the technology. The funding
serves to further advance the technology and potentially places
the university in a better negotiating position for a license
in the future. Although, the sponsor may demand predefined
terms, the university may be able to negotiate a milestone fee
or increased royalty rate if certain progress is made. In this
way, the university’s upside potential is somewhat preserved.
The company, on the other hand, is lowering its risk by not
formally committing to a commercialization obligation in the
event that the technology does not pan out.
C. Formation of a Start-Up Company
The start-up company strategy provides the highest risk of
any commercialization option available. In this approach, a
company is legally incorporated and the institution contributes
the technology through a license agreement in return for
a portion of the company’s equity. In general, the percent
of equity retained by the university is determined by: 1)
the perceived value of its contribution to the deal; 2) the
policies of the institution; and 3) the number of inventors. The
company then attempts to build additional value in the equity
by taking on the full responsibility of commercialization.
The start-up strategy requires building a well qualified and
balanced business and scientific team to develop the prototype
into a marketable product. Ultimately, the institution seeks
to gain additional financial value through selling their equity
stake in the company or through public offering of its stock.
Thus, if successful, the start up can reap large rewards for
the institution through the increase in value of its equity
ownership. It should be noted that a key advantage of this
approach is the fact that the institution owns equity in the
company, not just the technology. Hence, the increase in the
equity value could reflect company progress which is due to
technology that originally has gone beyond, or may in fact,
have nothing to do with the initial technology contributed
by the institution. In effect, the start-up company has added
value to the license and this benefits the institution. Many
schools, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
Stanford, and Harvard have benefited from the formation of
new venture start ups. The start-up strategy has at least two
major hurdles that must be overcome. First, to justify the high
risk involved in starting a new company, the technology in
general should be a new discovery. It must be a discovery that
could be considered as a core technology, which has a breadth
of applications and is basic to a field of scientific work, or
one that is a significant advance in a known field. The technology should have a large market potential and, if possible,
multiple product applications. The second, and perhaps the
most difficult, hurdle is securing sufficient financing. Although
the amount of seed funding varies with the desired business,
the establishment of the corporate infrastructure requires a
significant amount of capital. Unfortunately, seed funding is
the most difficult to obtain because it carries the greatest risk
to the investor.
It would appear that a start-up strategy would not be appropriate for the commercialization of the university’s SQUID
technology at this time. Although the shielding technology has

295

the potential to expand the use of SQUID-based devices by
permitting operation in unshielded environments, it is unclear
whether this technology alone is sufficient to warrant forming
a spin-off company. The proprietary position of the university,
moreover, has yet been to be determined and it is likely to be
limited to the shielding technology. The key to success for
a new technology start up, and what makes these ventures
attractive to investors, is the ability to exclude competitors
from the marketplace with well-protected intellectual property. As indicated earlier, it appears that several companies
and research laboratories are also working in the field of
background magnetic noise reduction, and many are more
experienced in developing SQUID-based instrumentation. It
is therefore imperative that a thorough assessment of the
university’s proprietary position be conducted before even
considering a start-up strategy. Even if the patent position of
the university is found to be strong, the unfavorable climate in
the medical device industry, particularly for new technologies,
does not bode well for a new start up. The high barriers to
entry, including regulatory issues, health care reform, and large
capital requirements will likely cause this venture to be viewed
by investors as far too risky, especially when an early stage
technology is involved.
XII. LESSONS FROM THE SQUID EXPERIENCE
A. The Need for a Thorough Patentability Opinion
It is nearly impossible to overstate the importance of a
speedy process to determine the extent to which the inventor,
and the university, have: 1) a discovery that could yield
protected intellectual property, and 2) the intellectual property
has potential market value. As mentioned previously, this
particular technology-transfer effort could fail as a result
of untimely action on this issue. Backlogs of unexamined
invention disclosures are common at many universities and can
greatly increase the difficulties of capitalizing on intellectual
property.
The value of intellectual property increases substantially
when patentability can be established. In this regard, timing
can be critical, particularly in a high-tech industry where technical advances occur rapidly. Since the prospect of patentability is often influenced by the date of filing, it is imperative
that patent decisions be made in a prompt manner to preserve
one’s patent rights. Although the United States still has a
“first to invent” priority system, an inventor’s position is
stronger when the invention is filed as soon as possible.
Once an enabling disclosure is made the inventor has one
year to file a patent in the United States, but the opportunity
to obtain foreign protection has been nullified. Complicating
this issue in academia is the need to publish, which puts
pressure on investigators to disclose their invention in the scientific literature. Unfortunately, in the case of the university’s
shielding technology, portions of the intellectual property had
already been published in an apparent enabling form and some
protection may have been lost. This situation illustrates that it
is important that universities have a timely invention-review
and decision-making process to determine whether to file

<-----Page 7----->296

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, VOL. 46, NO. 3, AUGUST 1999

before publication in order to maximize potential protection
and avoid hasty decisions. The process should include a
patentability opinion conducted by a competent patent attorney
to evaluate patentability. One of the major questions regarding
the commercial viability of the university’s SQUID technology
is strength of patent protection, particularly in light of the prior
public disclosure. The answer to this question is crucial because the proprietary strength of intellectual property generally
establishes the value of the technology. Our review of the prior
art, although certainly not exhaustive, revealed a number of
articles and patents that appear to embody similar techniques to
reduce background magnetic noise. To meet the PTO standards
of patentability, an invention must be novel, useful, and
nonobvious. The determination of whether the invention meets
these standards is important since patentability can be of value
by providing a company with a competitive advantage in the
marketplace. Therefore, conducting a patentability opinion is
a cost-effective step in the evaluation of new technology. As
such, a patentability opinion of the university’s technology
would be helpful in defining the value of the technology
and consequently, the strength of the university’s position
in negotiating a license agreement. To reduce legal fees, it
is possible for the inventor or the university to conduct a
preliminary literature search and supply the results to the
attorney.
B. Appropriateness of a Licensing Strategy
In this case, it would appear that a license strategy is the
most appropriate commercialization approach. The proprietary
position appears to be limited to advanced shielding technology to reduce background noise fields [39]. Furthermore, it is
not clear whether this technology provides enough novelty to
be patentable. Nonetheless, such shielding is a key component
of a commercially feasible MCG device, and if patentable, it
would definitely increase the value of the intellectual property.
Most universities, however, lack the expertise to develop
independently a product such as an MCG medical instrument.
The risks of commercialization are very high, given the
significant barriers to entry for the medical device industry.
In this case, the most logical strategy would seem to be
to approach SQUID-based instrument companies with active
programs to develop MCG’s. Other potential licensees could
include companies that have established products in competing
technologies such as ECG and ultrasound. These companies
have experience in bringing medical devices to market and
may be interested in gaining a competitive advantage with
cutting-edge technology that may one day replace or augment
their existing technologies. Finally, with a strong proprietary position, the university could nonexclusively license the
shielding technology to companies using SQUID’s for other
applications. This strategy would more fully exploit the value
of the licensing strategy. It also underscores the value and
importance of a strong proprietary position. It is imperative
that universities move quickly to determine the potential for
a strong patent and then move equally quickly to secure
such a position with inventions deemed to have commercial
potential.

C. Use of Sponsored Research Funding
In this and other such cases, universities may seek sponsored
research funding. Although this shielding technology is in a
relatively early stage of development, it is likely that designs
will evolve that will be more commercially feasible in terms
of both cost and operational efficiency. A commercial sponsor
with significant industry experience could also take immediate
advantage of the unique expertise available at the university
through sponsored research. In addition, universities can contact nonprofit organizations or investment funds for research
funding. Several investment funds specialize in providing early
stage development funds to universities that are involved in
research technologies related to specific medical applications.
Thus, it is frequently advantageous for universities to continue
to pursue grants from traditional public and private sources
to further advance their commercialization efforts on a given
technology. Such is certainly the case for this SQUID-based
technology.
D. Collaboration with Appropriate Medical Professionals
For a new medical technology to succeed in the current marketplace, developers will have to demonstrate clinical utility
and a cost savings to the health care system. Since commercial
use of SQUID’s is relatively new to the medical field, it
is imperative that universities intensify collaborations with
physicians to validate the clinical benefits associated with their
technologies. These interactions with medical professionals,
moreover, can provide insight to the cost issues that are
currently major concerns for reimbursement offices. Taken
together, university researchers will then be better informed
and can better refine the technology to meet the needs of
both the patient and the physician, and increase the potential
for commercial success. In addition, results of collaborations could be published in medical journals, further adding
creditability to the technology. This particular university is
fortunate to have a nearby major medical center as a resource
for clinical studies involving the SQUID technology.
XIII. CONCLUSIONS
This study provides several important implications for technology transfer and commercialization of university developed
technologies. First, technology-transfer programs must continue to improve their role in being a resource for the university
researcher for issues involving intellectual property. In this
regard, technology-transfer offices must develop clear measures for handling university-developed intellectual property.
A lack of clear policies and guidelines can create confusion
among researchers and lead to delays and potential loss of
valuable intellectual property rights. It is neither an easy nor
an exact process for universities to sort through the many and
varied disclosures they receive and to select those to pursue
and maintain. Despite the inherent difficulties, it is critical
that universities develop and maintain an expeditious means
of evaluating invention disclosures from their researchers. The
strategic window for technological advances is generally extremely short lived. In any given technological arena, there are
a number of competing labs, each with its own approach to a

<-----Page 8----->DEL CAMPO et al.: TRANSFER AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MEDICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

given technological problem. Slowdowns in the review process
can allow competing universities and other laboratories to
catch up and the potential competitive edge to evanesce. Thus,
if a university-developed technology is to have a chance in
the marketplace, the university must decide quickly to either
pursue the technology or to release it to the inventors for them
to pursue on their own.
Second, universities through their technology-transfer offices must also work with the university researchers to focus
their efforts on strengthening their intellectual property claims.
To do so requires better education of the researchers on issues
such as: the danger of premature disclosure of discoveries and
the laws governing what constitutes a patentable invention and
inventorship. Universities, moreover, must work on ways to
help researchers balance out the conflicting incentives of the
need to publish and the need to protect intellectual property.
While improvement in the turnaround time of invention reviews will certainly help on this issue, this effort alone is
not sufficient. For most academicians the pressure to publish
is a much stronger motivator than the desire to attempt
commercialization. The research and publication process is
well known and its value is socialized early in graduate
education. Commercialization is at best an unknown process
with dubious payoffs.
Third, universities must increase their efforts to develop
ties with industry. In the medical technology arena, this
means collaboration with physicians and with firms in medical
technology and related industries. Forming partnerships with
physicians and industry representatives can help to eliminate
some of the problems related to the lack of line-of-sight to the
customer and can lead to better designed products that meet
the needs of the marketplace. Such partnerships also help to
bring multiple perspectives to bear on problem solving. In
an industry as complex as medical technology this sort of
triangulation is an absolute necessity.
Finally, technology-transfer offices need a full understanding of the issues affecting the process of commercialization
for a particular technology. Without a proper understanding
of the market environment into which the technology will
be commercialized, it is easy to overvalue or undervalue the
technology and develop unrealistic expectations. The basic
technologies coming out of universities are often extremely
expensive and difficult to commercialize. The true value of
scientific research and discovery is often difficult to establish.
It is, therefore, necessary for technology-transfer offices to
fully acquaint themselves with not only with the general
commercialization efforts needed to bring products to market,
but also with the specifics of the relevant markets. This
knowledge is essential in selecting an appropriate technologytransfer strategy. Universities must develop systems to apply
a business like approach in the evaluation of new technologies, including a thorough market analysis and assessment
of economic feasibility. This approach will help in formulating a more appropriate technology-transfer strategy that
realistically matches the particular technology and its stage
of development. In this way, the potential for successful commercialization of university technologies can be significantly
improved.
