“In a Resource-based view, discerning appropriate inputs is ultimately a matter of
entrepreneurial vision and intuition, the creative act underlying such vision is a subject
that so far has not been a central focus of resource-based theory development”
(Conner, 1991, p. 121).
Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between resource-based theory and entrepreneurship and
develops insights that advance the boundaries of resource-based theory and begin to address important
questions in entrepreneurship. We extend the boundaries of resource-based theory to include the
cognitive ability of individual entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs have individual-specific resources that
facilitate the recognition of new opportunities and the assembling of resources for the venture. By
focusing on resources, from opportunity recognition to the ability to organize these resources into a
firm and then to the creation of heterogeneous outputs through the firm that are superior to the market,
we help identify issues that begin to address the distinctive domain of entrepreneurship. © 2001

1. Introduction
Early work on resource-based theory (RBT) acknowledged that entrepreneurship is an
intricate part of the resource-based framework (Connor, 1991; Rumelt, 1987). However,
while RBT has become a dominant paradigm for strategic management research (Peteraf,

1993), the interface between RBT and entrepreneurship has amounted to little more than
providing a “research setting” for empirical work (e.g., Chandler & Hanks, 1994). Because
of the lack of consideration given to entrepreneurship by most resource-based research,
current RBT largely fails to integrate creativity and the entrepreneurial act (Barney, 2001).
An understanding of how entrepreneurial actions, the creation and combining of resources
that create new heterogeneous resources, can inform RBT by suggesting alternative uses of
resources that have not been previously discovered leading to heterogeneous firm resources.
It is the firm’s unique bundle of resources that is different from competitor firms that are
potentially valuable and contribute to a firm’s competitive advantage.
Much prior research on entrepreneurship can be characterized as either work that describes the phenomena or work that borrows theories ad hoc from other disciplines. While
an entrepreneurship context provides an excellent setting for much empirical research, the
field of entrepreneurship needs to move further to create specific boundaries to establish the
field’s legitimacy and distinctive contribution (Busenitz et al., 2001). One of several challenges with entrepreneurship scholarship is that research settings often span several units of
analysis leading to fragmentation of the field.
Entrepreneurial opportunities exist primarily because different agents have different
beliefs about the relative value of resources when they are converted from inputs into outputs
(Schumpeter, 1934; Kirzner, 1979; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Indeed, heterogeneity is
a common attribute of both resource-based and entrepreneurship theory—although resourcebased logic has tended to focus on heterogeneity of resources while entrepreneurship theory
has tended to focus on heterogeneity in beliefs about the value of resources. However, when
it is recognized that beliefs about the value of resources are themselves resources, apparent
conflicts between the two theories are resolved.
Put differently, entrepreneurship and RBT adopt precisely the same unit of analysis—the
resource. These resources may manifest themselves in several different ways. For example,
firm-specific resources may reflect cognitive differences between managers in these firms.
The different ways that resources, and the opportunities to exploit these resources, manifest
themselves have resulted in different units of analysis and has hindered good theory
development in the field of entrepreneurship. In this paper we examine entrepreneurship
from individual opportunity recognition, to the firm’s organizational capabilities, to the
market, however in all three instances the resource is the unit of analysis. Through the
integration of resources, from cognitive differences to opportunity recognition to the ability
to organize these resources into a firm, we may begin to address the issue of the distinctive
domain of entrepreneurship.
This paper has two primary purposes. First, we extend the boundaries of RBT by
introducing two entrepreneurial concepts: 1) entrepreneurial recognition, which we define as
the recognition of opportunities and opportunity seeking behavior as a resource and 2) the
process of combining and organizing resources as a resource. The second goal is to build
theory for the field of entrepreneurship that can potentially span micro to marco issues by
focusing on resources as the unit of analysis. This effort is organized around the four
conditions of RBT: resource heterogeneity, ex post limits to competition, imperfect factor
mobility and ex ante limits to competition (Peteraf, 1993). By examining entrepreneurship,
which we define as the recognition and exploitation of opportunities that result in the creation

<-----Page 2----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

757

of a firm that seeks to obtain entrepreneurial rents, through the four conditions of RBT we
theoretically inform and extend current research in both RBT and entrepreneurship.

2. Resource heterogeneity
Resource heterogeneity is the most basic condition of resource-based theory and it
assumes at least some resource bundles and capabilities underlying production are heterogeneous across firms (Barney, 1991). Resource-based theory suggests that heterogeneity is
necessary but not sufficient for a sustainable advantage. For example a firm can have
heterogeneous assets, but not the other conditions suggested by resource-based theory, and
those assets will only generate a short-term advantage until they are imitated.
Similar to RBT, heterogeneous resources are also a basic condition of entrepreneurship
(Kirzner, 1997). Entrepreneurial opportunities are thought to exist when different agents
have insight into the value of resources that other agents do not, and the agents with the
insight act upon these un-exploited opportunities (Kirzner, 1979; Casson, 1982). If these
agents are correct, an entrepreneurial rent will be earned; if not an opportunity loss will occur
(Rumelt, 1987; Alvarez and Barney, 2000).
Since the 1991 Journal of Management special issue on the resource-based model,
strategy researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance of heterogeneous
firm assets (relative to competitor firms) in achieving a firm’s sustainable competitive
advantage. Barney (1986) and Dierickx and Cool (1989) were the first to draw attention to
the importance of tacit socially complex assets. Paradoxically, while the importance of
resource heterogeneity among firms has been acknowledged, strategists have given scant
attention to the process by which these resources are discovered, turned from inputs into
heterogeneous outputs, and exploited to extract greater profits. Thus, we argue that entrepreneurship is about cognition, discovery, pursuing market opportunities, and coordinating
knowledge that lead to heterogeneous outputs.
2.1. Entrepreneurial cognition and heterogeneity
There is probably no group of individuals that have received more discussion and have
been assumed to be more heterogeneous from the rest of the population than entrepreneurs.
The notion that entrepreneurs were somehow different from the rest of the population
provided the impetus for substantial research on the subject in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of
this research focused on a host of traits such as risk-taking and the need for achievement, but
unfortunately, the findings have been disappointing (for a review, see Low & MacMillan,
1988). Recently, the emergence of cognitive approaches to understanding how entrepreneurs
think and make strategic decisions is showing much promise (Busenitz & Barney, 1997;
Baron, 1998; Forbes, 1999). If entrepreneurs do indeed have a unique mindset or orientation
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996), then it follows that their cognitive approaches are likely to have
strengths and weaknesses in various competitive environments and are a potential source of
competitive advantage (Barney, 1991).
In clarifying how entrepreneurs think, Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that entrepre-

<-----Page 3----->758

neurs use heuristics more extensively than managers in larger organizations. The term
“heuristics” refers to simplifying strategies that individuals (entrepreneurs in this case) use
to make strategic decisions, especially in complex situations where less complete or uncertain information is available. Entrepreneurial cognition is defined here as the extensive use
of individual heuristics and beliefs that impact decision-making (Busenitz & Lau, 1996;
Wright, Hoskisson, Busenitz & Dial, 2000). Managerial cognition is referred to as more
systematic decision-making where managers use accountability and compensation schemes,
the structural coordination of business activities across various units, and justify future
developments using quantifiable budgets. In sum, managerial cognition is more factual-based
while entrepreneurial cognition builds from limited or key experiences and beliefs.
Most of the research on cognition has generally assumed that individuals tend to make
decisions (and the use of heuristics) in a similar fashion and are susceptible to common
errors. However, recent research on cognition indicates that entrepreneurs use heuristics in
their decision-making more than their managerial counterparts in large organizations (Baron,
1998; Busenitz & Barney, 1997). Consequently, they often make significant leaps in their
thinking leading to innovative ideas that are not always very linear and factually based. This
research stream is now starting to recognize that entrepreneurs’ more extensive use of
heuristics in their decision making is at least a partial extension of who they are as
individuals (e.g., Baron, 1998; Wright et al., 2000). Without attention to these cognitive
processes, our understanding of entrepreneurs is significantly limited. This has particular
implications for entrepreneurs because they regularly find themselves in situations that tend
to maximize the potential impact of various heuristics (Baron, 1998).
In probing these cognitive processes, it is important to first understand the utility of such
decision-making. Given the high ambiguity and uncertainty that entrepreneurs typically face
in the pursuit of a new venture, the willingness and confidence to readily rely on heuristics
to piece together limited information to make convincing decisions may be virtually the only
way to progress forward (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). The use of a more factual-based logic
in the pursuit of new opportunities becomes too overwhelming and very costly if not
impossible. The decision-making contexts facing entrepreneurs also tend to be more complex. The heuristic-based logic can have a great deal of utility in enabling entrepreneurs to
make decisions that exploit brief windows of opportunity (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
whereas the elaborate policies, procedural routines and structural mechanisms common to
those with more of a managerial cognition (managers in large organizations) are likely to
erect barriers in the pursuit of innovative activities.
Central to most models of learning is the issue of achieving new understandings, interpretations and insights (Daft & Weick, 1984). Learning in the context of entrepreneurship
may also have some important links to the use of heuristics in decision-making. Sources of
competitive advantage are thought to potentially evolve around knowledge-creation and
decision-making capabilities (Barney, 1991). Lower-level learning tends to follow the more
rational model by focusing on repetitious observations and routinized learning. Such learning
tends to be short-term and temporary (Fiol & Lyles, 1985). Consistent with the notion of
single-loop learning, there are few changes in underlying policies or values (Argyris &
Schon, 1978). Such learning modes tend to be slower and more imitable (Lei, Hitt & Bettis,

<-----Page 4----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

759

1996), in part because decision-makers usually build on results from repeated outcomes of
success or failure to reach their decisions.
Higher-level learning involves the formation and use of heuristics to generate new insights
into solving ambiguous problems (Lei et al., 1996). Such learning tends to create new
insights and direction for emerging paths to solve specific problems. While the heuristicbased logic may use less information and be less accurate, use of individual-specific clusters
of knowledge facilitates quick adjustments to emerging trends (Krabuanrat & Phelps, 1998).
Taken together, the more frequent presence of heuristic-based logic in decision making by
entrepreneurs (Busenitz & Barney, 1997) suggests that they think differently leading them to
make decisions in fundamentally different ways from those that approach things in a more
factual manner such as managers in large organizations. This heuristic-based logic enables
entrepreneurs to more quickly make sense out of uncertain and complex situations. Such
decision approaches can lead to forward-looking approaches (Gavetti & Levinthal, 2000)
perceiving new opportunities, faster learning and unorthodox interpretations (innovations).
In essence, this closer look at the potential advantages and disadvantages of a heuristic-based
logic sheds important light on how entrepreneurial cognition can be a source of competitive
advantage. If the insights and decisions reached with heuristic-based logic are potentially
valuable in the market, if they are indeed rare, if they are difficult to imitate, and if the
generated ideas are exploited by the entrepreneurs, then these entrepreneurial insights and
decisions are a resource that can potentially lead to a competitive advantage.
In sum, it appears that those who use a heuristic-based logic cannot only make faster
decisions, but they also learn more quickly. We argue here that those with an entrepreneurial
cognition can facilitate a potential competitive advantage in at least two important ways. The
first area has to do with the discovery of new opportunities. An entrepreneurial cognition
perspective provides a way for us to better understand why some individuals are able to see
new opportunities where most others see either a benign environment or emerging threats.
The second area involves the development of a firm in the initial stages of organizational
development. A heuristic-based decision style may allow them to readily navigate through a
wide array of problems and irregularities inherent in the development of new firms. We now
discuss these two areas.
2.2. Entrepreneurial discovery and heterogeneity
One of the fundamental reasons for the fascination with entrepreneurs and the inventions
that they develop seems to center around why and how they see and create new opportunities.
An entrepreneurial opportunity invariably involves the development of a new idea that others
have overlooked or chosen not to pursue. In the context of environmental change, those with
an entrepreneurial cognition orientation often see new opportunities where others tend to be
concerned with protecting themselves from emerging threats and changes. The cognitive
ability of entrepreneurs to frame situations in an opportunistic manner is a heterogeneous
resource that can be used to organize other resources.
Explanations for entrepreneurial discovery have evolved primarily around two perspectives: 1) the searching for and obtaining of information leading to new inventions and 2) the
recognition process by which new discoveries are made. From the search perspective,

<-----Page 5----->760

S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

discoveries are generally modeled to be the result of an extensive search targeted in the
direction where the discovery is to be made (Stigler, 1961; Caplan, 1999). This stream of
research generally assumes that entrepreneurs know a priori where the invention needs to be
made and can accurately weight the cost and benefits of acquiring new information relevant
to the invention.
In arguing that the search for discovery cannot be accurately modeled as a rational search
process, Austrian economists have posited that the focus should be on the process side of
discovery. More explicitly, Kirzner (1979) developed the term “entrepreneurial alertness” as
the ability to see where products (or services) do not exist or have unsuspectedly emerged
as valuable. Alertness exists when one individual has an insight into the value of a given
resource when others do not. From this perspective, entrepreneurial alertness refers to
“flashes of superior insight” that enable one to recognize an opportunity when it presents
itself (Kirzner, 1997). In distinguishing between entrepreneurial alertness and the knowledge
expert, Kirzner (1979) argues that the knowledge expert does not fully recognize the value
of their knowledge or how to turn that knowledge into a profit or else the expert would be
an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur may not have the specific knowledge of the expert (such
as technological expertise) but it is the entrepreneur who recognizes the value and the
opportunity of the expert’s knowledge. While the entrepreneur may have specialized knowledge it is the tacit generalized knowledge of how to organize specialized knowledge that is
the entrepreneur’s critical intangible resource.
In the case of entrepreneurship the specialized knowledge is often knowledge about
opportunities created by the environment or a new product or even the opportunities of a
potential new product. As we uncover the phenomenon surrounding entrepreneurial cognition, it is becoming clearer why entrepreneurs see new discoveries more readily than their
counterparts. Their heuristic-based logic appears to give them a competitive advantage in
quickly learning about new changes and what the implication of those changes are for the
development of specific discoveries.
2.3. Market opportunities and heterogeneity
Debate in the field of entrepreneurship has sometimes focused on whether or not the
perfect competition model applies in explaining entrepreneurial behavior (Kirzner, 1997;
Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). However, a second, albeit related, question has received less
attention: under what conditions can entrepreneurial opportunities be most efficiently realized through market exchanges, and under what conditions can they most efficiently be
realized through nonmarket forms of exchanges.
Entrepreneurs can use market forms of governance to coordinate many resources necessary to realize an economic opportunity; they also can use a firm, as a form of hierarchical
governance, to realize these opportunities. The conditions under which these alternative
forms of governance will be more or less effective have yet to be described in the
entrepreneurship literature. Put differently, this question becomes when is it less costly for
the entrepreneur to coordinate the resources and disparate knowledge needed to realize an
economic opportunity through a firm and when is it less costly for the market to coordinate

<-----Page 6----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

761

these resources? The answer to these questions would constitute a theory of the entrepreneurial firm.
When the completion of a transaction requires specific investments, more hierarchical
forms of governance will be preferred over less hierarchical governance (Williamson, 1975).
In the context of the realization of entrepreneurial opportunities, when these opportunities
require economic actors to make highly specific investments, firms will be preferred over
markets as a way to realize an economic opportunity.
Resource-based logic identifies the kinds of resources and capabilities that require specific
investment in order for their full economic value to be realized–resources and capabilities
that are socially complex, path dependent, tacit, and so forth (Barney, 1995). Thus, when the
realization of the economic value associated with an entrepreneurial opportunity depends on
the use of socially complex, path dependent, or tacit resources and capabilities, it is more
likely that hierarchical governance—a firm—will be used to realize this value than nonhierarchical governance.
These ideas suggest that conditions which require the efficient coordination of and
integration of knowledge are those in which entrepreneurial firms are likely to arise in an
economy (Coase, 1937; Hayek, 1945; Kirzner, 1997). Schumpeter (1934) distinguished
between invention and innovation, with invention being the discovery of an opportunity and
innovation the exploitation of a profitable opportunity. The importance of the distinction
between invention and innovation is that it focuses on the firm as a problem solving
institution (Demsetz, 1991). Instead of concentrating on the market, the focus is on the role
of entrepreneurship as the integration of disparate specialized knowledge (as suggested by
both Schumpeter and Coase). Firm formation is essentially an entrepreneurial act because to
coordinate and transmit tacit knowledge the coordination of the firm is required.
The entrepreneur’s ability to convert creative insights and often homogenous inputs into
heterogeneous outputs make the firm a superior choice over the market. The classic story is
that profit maximization and efficiency require the substitution of firms for markets if the cost
of using markets becomes large relative to the cost of the entrepreneur forming a firm (Coase,
1937). In its simplest form, if the market transaction cost is zero and the entrepreneurial firm
cost is greater than zero the entrepreneurial firm will not exist. However, it is not a trivial task
to distinguish purchase prices across markets from firm production prices because firm
production involves the use of inputs that are purchased. Therefore, the transformation of
inputs into outputs by the firm must also result in homogeneous firms in-order for markets
to be substitutes for firms. Up until now we are assuming that the production costs of firms
do not take into account differences in knowledge or knowledge costs. However because
knowledge is not free and it does differ across firms, firms are heterogeneous and the
entrepreneur’s coordination of specialized disparate knowledge makes the heterogeneous
firm a superior choice over markets. Firms are a bundle of commitments to technology,
human resources, and processes all blanketed by knowledge that is specific to the firm. It is
this bundle, and how the entrepreneur coordinates this bundle, that allow firms to be
heterogeneous and thus these firms cannot be easily altered or imitated.
Hayek (1945) further expands on the importance of learning and knowledge in the
entrepreneurial process. In this view the entrepreneur experiences both partial ignorance and
learning at the same time. The ignorance is a result of uncertainty about the future. The

<-----Page 7----->762

learning however, is a result of buyers and sellers learning to adjust their behavior over time
to conduct their transactions at the optimal level. The entrepreneurial process in this sense is
about information discovery of the market and the coordination of disparate tacit knowledge.
What distinguishes this view of the entrepreneur as a pure buyer and seller (markets) and the
entrepreneur as the exploiter of opportunities (firms), is the incorporation of learning and
knowledge. If the application of knowledge requires coordinating many types of specialized
knowledge then the firm is required for the integration of knowledge.
2.4. Coordinated knowledge and heterogeneity
Entrepreneurial knowledge is the ability to take conceptual, abstract information of where
and how to obtain undervalued resources, explicit and tacit, and how to deploy and exploit
these resources. Both Kirzner (1979) and Schumpeter (1934) describe the entrepreneurial
role as the decision to direct inputs into certain processes rather than into other processes.
Entrepreneurship involves what Schumpeter termed “new combinations” of resources.
Schumpeter (1934) described the entrepreneur as the one who combined productive factors
in some new way, a product, production method or a market. He further maintained that
innovation was driven by the entrepreneur (who is at the heart of the firm) and not consumer
driven (markets). Schumpeter suggested five situations where the phenomena of bundling
resources by entrepreneurs to produce new resources occurs. The entrepreneur “reforms or
revolutionizes the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or an untried technology
for producing a new commodity or producing an old one in a new way, by opening up a new
source of supply of materials, or a new outlet for products, or by reorganizing an industry”
(Schumpeter, 1934, p. 132).
The focus of most current entrepreneurship research into opportunities has been on
markets (Kirzner, 1997). This is true whether the market is a product market or a factor
market (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). However, once the discussion turns to factor
markets and thus production (the creation of value through the transformation of inputs into
outputs) there becomes a need for the coordination of numerous types of specialized
knowledge (Grant & Baden-Fuller, 1995).
Knowledge comprises information, technology, know-how, and skills (Grant & BadenFuller, 1995) and can either be explicit such as in technology or tacit which is personal and
more difficult to communicate (Polanyi, 1962) or imitate (Barney, 1991). Individuals acquire
knowledge and individuals store tacit knowledge. However until it is coordinated, knowledge
is often dispersed, fragmented, and sometimes even contradictory. The entrepreneurial
problem is how to secure the best use of resources to obtain a profit. Thus entrepreneurial
knowledge is an abstract knowledge of where and how to obtain these resources. When the
market is unable to organize distributed knowledge the entrepreneur understands this and
capitalizes upon the opportunity resulting in a new firm. Therefore, it is not the market that
organizes tacit knowledge, in fact it is often the case that markets are inefficient at knowledge
transfer and integration, it is the firm that efficiently organizes knowledge. The primary role
of the firm is the integration of specialized knowledge (Demsetz, 1991; Conner & Prahalad,
1996).
Because the primary role of the firm is the integration of specialized knowledge, we then

<-----Page 8----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

763

go back to our question, “when are markets more efficient at organizing knowledge and when
are entrepreneurial firms more efficient at organizing knowledge?” Since individuals have
cognitive limitations the acquisition of knowledge is often specialized. Specialized knowledge is usually achieved at the expense of generalized knowledge. However, to apply
knowledge the need is not just for specialized knowledge but perhaps more importantly for
generalized knowledge. Therefore, if efficiency is the acquisition of specialized knowledge,
the application of knowledge requires generalized knowledge and a means for the integration
of knowledge.
Markets are inefficient at integrating knowledge because explicit knowledge can be easily
imitated and tacit knowledge cannot be articulated (Grant & Baden-Fuller, 1995). Explicit
knowledge has the character of a public good it can be transferred at low cost. Once explicit
knowledge is made known, it is easily imitated and it becomes incapable of generating rents
for the original knowledge producer. Tacit knowledge by definition cannot be articulated and
thus cannot be transferred at arms-length.
Kirzner (1979) distinguishes between entrepreneurial knowledge and the knowledge
expert, suggesting that it is the entrepreneur that hires the later. The knowledge expert does
not fully recognize the value of their knowledge or how to turn that knowledge into a profit
or else the expert would act as an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur may not have the depth of
specific knowledge that the specialist has (such as technology expertise) but it is the
entrepreneur who recognizes the value and the opportunity of the specialist’s knowledge.
While the entrepreneur may have some specialized knowledge of a resource (i.e., technology), what makes the entrepreneur unusual is the entrepreneur’s function relies more on their
ability to organize specialized knowledge. Thus the knowledge expert has specialized
knowledge and the entrepreneur has generalized knowledge and it is through the firm that the
two types of knowledge are joined to produce rents.

3. Ex post limits to competition
Regardless of the nature of the firm heterogeneity, sustained competitive advantage
requires that heterogeneity be preserved. If heterogeneity is not durable it will not add
sustained value. This is the case when there are ex post limits to competition. Subsequent to
a firm gaining a superior position there must be forces that limit competition (Peteraf, 1993),
otherwise heterogeneous advantages dissipate. Ex post limits to competition can reflect
cognitive differences, strategic complementarity, causal ambiguity, uncertainty, information
asymmetries, all of which are particularly important in entrepreneurial settings.
3.1. Entrepreneurial cognition and competition
Thinking on ex post limits to competition has typically been focused at the firm-level and
whether competing firms can readily acquire the necessary resources to return the market to
competitive parity (Barney, 1991; Conner & Prahalad, 1996). We focus here on the cognitive
make-up and beliefs of individual entrepreneurs. Rather than the focus being on the longterm outcome of an entrepreneurial firm, we are interested in better understanding how those

<-----Page 9----->764

S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

with an entrepreneurial cognition see opportunities that others have overlooked and how they
are able to bootstrap together the necessary resources to start firms that attempt to exploit
entrepreneurial opportunities.
After a new firm is launched with some initial success, those from the outside often
question why they did not think of the idea first. Still others may indicate that they had
thought of the idea but never attempted to exploit it. In either case, the issue remains that the
idea has been identified and initially developed into a business concept by an entrepreneur,
not by those on the sidelines. Meanwhile, while those who wished that they had seen and
acted on the concept first, the entrepreneur is often busy working and thinking about
additional inventions and business concepts. Most individuals tend to be concerned with
protecting themselves from emerging threats and changes, particularly in uncertain environments, while those with an entrepreneurial cognition continue to probe for new opportunities.
The competition for thinking of new firm opportunities tends to remain stable even though
many individuals seem to wish that they had had the foresight to capitalize on the entrepreneurial opportunities once they become visible.
Ex post limits and entrepreneurial cognition provide a theoretical rationale for recent
research that has identified habitual entrepreneurs as an important group of entrepreneurs
(Westhead & Wright, 1998). Rosa and Scott (1999) found that the greatest growth occurred
in companies that were embryonic business clusters rather than a single one-dimensional
business. This suggests that the greatest source of new high-growth potential businesses
tends to come from entrepreneurs with existing businesses. Their unique ways of thinking
and experience with earlier ventures seems to provide a corridor for additional entrepreneurial pursuits. Want-a-be entrepreneurs without an entrepreneurial cognitive makeup along
with the lack of entrepreneurial experience are significantly restrained from competing in the
development of future innovations.
3.2. Opportunity recognition
As indicated above in the theory of entrepreneurial cognition, the way some people think
and make decisions allows them to function effectively in the pursuit of new inventions.
Given that individual characteristics and decision styles cannot be readily transferred to
want-a-be entrepreneurs, it becomes apparent that they are sources of competitive advantage
in the entrepreneurial domain. We argue that this is true with opportunity recognition for the
following reason. Those with an entrepreneurial cognition perspective tend to use heuristicbased rather than factual-based logic often leading them to develop and assemble resources
in new ways. Information is certainty important to those with a heuristic-based logic,
however, it is often assembled in a nontraditional nonlinear manner. More factually oriented
logic builds from proven information and the rationale for a new opportunity needs to
progress in a logical manner. Since new inventions and opportunities rarely evolve in a
logical manner, those with a factually oriented logic tend to become very frustrated by the
nonlinearity of opportunity recognition while those with a heuristic-based logic tend to thrive
on it.

3.3. Strategic complementarity
Schumpeter theorized that innovation proceeded in a jerky rather than an even fashion.
After the initial entrepreneur has introduced a breakthrough innovation with some initial
success, other less capable entrepreneurs emerge with new businesses and incremental
innovations that “swarm” the new enterprise with similar look-alike imitations. The appearance of the first (more qualified) entrepreneurs facilitate the appearance of others by making
innovation easier for less qualified entrepreneurs, in essence innovation becomes increasingly familiar and we now have a “new processes” of innovation. The innovative success of
the lead entrepreneurs result in an increase in the price of the means of production. Physical
units of production are produced under conditions of constant returns to scale, characterized
by falling average cost but constant marginal cost. Resources that were once scarce and now
profitable tend to become less scarce and heterogeneous advantages held by the lead
entrepreneurs dissipate.
Schumpeter suggests that new combinations of resources are new ways of competing and
that these new ways of competing do not as a rule come from existing firms but rather from
new firms that develop alongside established firms. This is consistent with the notion of
strategic complementarity1 that suggests that when quantities of capital goods that are
complements go up because of increased demand, the marginal productivity of the good is
raised and the demand goes up. If a firm currently exists it increases its output during this
time, this is also the time when new firms enter markets because of the increased demand
created by the lead entrepreneur. Strategic complementarity is consistent with Schumpeter’s
argument that the early entrepreneur appears alongside existing firms and then the swarmlike appearance of other (less qualified) entrepreneurs leads to many small firms forming en
mass in a concentrated area. A familiar form of monopolistic competition characterizes the
resulting equilibrium, though now instead of one large firm there is a large number of small
firms. What has occurred is that total profits have likely minimized at the lowest level of
uncertainty and we now have firms functioning efficiently where as before there might have
been waste which occurred as a result of reorganizing resources. The more imitative
entrepreneurs that enter during the monopoly stage the more uncertainty is minimized and
profits are redistributed possibly diluting total wealth. During this stage of the innovative
process endogenous innovation motivated by the leader entrepreneurs is sufficient to generate robust, endogenous fluctuations in aggregate investment in new innovations (Evans,
Honkapohja & Romer, 1996). In other words, the innovative entrepreneurial act of once
again recombining new resources start a new cycle (Schumpeter, 1934). The entrepreneur’s
ability to continuously innovate is the primary competitive advantage of the entrepreneurial
firm, leading to sustainable entrepreneurial firms and sustainable wealth creation (Alvarez &
Barney, 2001).
However, as firms get larger the costs of organizing additional transactions within the firm
may rise and the returns to the entrepreneurial function decrease (Coase, 1937). Once a firm
reaches the point where the cost of organizing an extra transaction becomes equal to the
market costs either the market will organize the transaction or a new entrepreneur will enter
and organize the new knowledge. The entrepreneurial knowledge of resource reorganization
that is critical to the transformation of inputs into heterogeneous outputs becomes lost as the

<-----Page 11----->766

firm grows (Coase, 1937) and the now large firm begins to resemble the market. If, the
explanation of entrepreneurship stops at this point, we have nothing more than a transaction
cost story of entrepreneurship. What stops the cycle is the isolating mechanism of causal
ambiguity (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982).
3.4. Causal ambiguity
Causal ambiguity is the uncertainty regarding the causes of efficiency differences among
firms. It prevents potential imitators from knowing exactly what to imitate and how to
imitate. If as Schumpeter assumed that a firm must incur a fixed research and development
cost before it can produce a new type of good, then these sunk costs along with the
uncertainty of how to imitate may limit competition and preserve heterogeneity. Causal
ambiguity muddles the link between the resources controlled by a firm and a firm’s sustained
competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly. The host firm
does not always clearly understand this linkage, let alone its competitors or potential
competitors.
A central assumption of the knowledge-based view of organizations is that knowledge
accumulates through the process of creativity and exploration and is implemented through
organizational exploitation. As an individual firm uses its existing knowledge in exploration
and exploitation, it (firm knowledge) grows and multiplies into new knowledge. Entrepreneurial firms are often built around the founding entrepreneur who identifies the opportunity
and moves to exploit it commercially. Often it is the founder (or founding team) who
possesses much of the technical and managerial knowledge that make-up the tangible and
intangible assets of the firm. In sum, an entrepreneur’s expanding knowledge base and
absorptive capacity becomes an entrepreneurial firm’s competitive advantage.
The entrepreneurial firm’s absorptive capacity determines how successful the entrepreneurial firm will be in obtaining entrepreneurial rents. Based on Cohen and Levinthal’s
(1990) definition, “absorptive capacity is the ability to recognize external information,
assimilate this information, and apply it to commercial ends” (p. 128). Cohen and Levinthal’s
definition assumes that an organization’s absorptive capacity is “absolute.” In other words,
the absorptive capacity of the organization is the same regardless of the situation or timing.
However, several researchers (Lane, 1997; Lane & Lubatkin, 1998) have observed that the
absorptive capacity of the organization might be relative to the organization’s current context
or situation. Similar to a sponge that is slightly damp as opposed to one that is bone dry, the
damp sponge absorbs water faster.
Cohen and Levinthal’s original work on absorptive capacity only addressed issues of
technological capabilities, but it also appears to have implications for managerial capabilities. Lane, Lyles and Salk (1998) suggest that managerial capabilities are acquired through
experience and tend to be firm specific. Thus, firms differ in their level of “managerial
absorptive capacity” and by extension entrepreneurial absorptive capacity. The more entrepreneurs and their firms have previously absorbed in terms of entrepreneurial capabilities
such as opportunity recognition and the continuous innovation that transforms inputs into
heterogeneous outputs, the greater their absorptive capacity. Greater amounts of an entrepreneurial firm’s specific experience and learning contribute to the entrepreneurial firm’s

<-----Page 12----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

767

absorptive capacity creating causal ambiguity preventing other firms from imitating. Increased learning and growing absorptive capacity tends to create higher levels of causal
ambiguity and growing difficulty for potential imitators.
Causal ambiguity may be the essence of entrepreneurship because when the reasons for
firm heterogeneity are poorly understood these reasons are often entrepreneurial in nature
and thus difficult to imitate. However, when the reasons for heterogeneity are understood,
even within the firm itself, the entrepreneurial knowledge becomes common knowledge that
can be imitated by less qualified entrepreneurs.

4. Imperfect factor mobility
In discussing the imitation of valuable but nontradable asset stocks, Dierickx and Cool
(1989), argued that the imitability of assets depends on the process by which it was
accumulated. They identify the following conditions under which imitation may be limited:
time compression dis-economies, asset mass efficiencies, interconnectedness of asset stocks,
asset erosion, and causal ambiguity. The importance to resource based theory is that these
assets are inimitable because they have a strong tacit dimension and are socially complex. In
the entrepreneurship domain, tacit socially complex assets are often specific to the founder
and the organizations they create. These are idiosyncratic assets that are more valuable when
used in the firm than outside of the firm. These assets which are often intangible tend to be
difficult to observe, describe, and value but have a significant impact on a firm’s competitive
advantage (Itami, 1987). For example some of these assets may include an entrepreneurial
cognition that recognizes and generates new opportunities, build trusting relationships with
other individuals and firms, and bootstrap together the necessary resources for a venture to
successfully launch. Two characteristics of these and other related assets is that they tend to
be characterized by social complexity and path dependence.
4.1. Entrepreneurship and social complexity
When a firm’s resources and capabilities are socially complex they are likely to be sources
of sustained heterogeneity (Barney, 1995). Socially complex resources may be difficult to
imitate because they are complex phenomena that are hard to systematically manage and
influence. Since new ventures typically start with a founder, the socially complex phenomena
by definition occur outside the firm. While this has received little attention, the interaction
between those with entrepreneurial cognition and the broader society creates an interesting
context in which to understand how learning transpires reflecting a socially complex asset.
Many resources that lead to heterogeneity are socially complex such as firm culture
(Barney, 1986) firm reputation (Hill, 1990), and human capital (Carpenter, Sanders &
Gregersen, 2001). Similar to these other assets entrepreneurial ability, the accumulated
practical skill or expertise that allows the entrepreneur to exploit opportunities efficiently, is
socially complex. While it is possible to specify how this socially complex asset of entrepreneurial ability adds value to the firm, it is not easy to imitate and other firms cannot just

<-----Page 13----->768

S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

create entrepreneurial ability. We suspect that it may be the social complexity of entrepreneurship that has hindered theoretical work on entrepreneurship.
The condition of social complexity is important to entrepreneurship because it reminds us
that complex technologies are not imperfectly imitable. It is the exploitation of these
complex technologies that involve the use of socially complex resources that is important.
An entrepreneurial firm with a complex technology needs additional exploitation knowledge
(such as entrepreneurial knowledge) to fully exploit its specialized knowledge (the technology) and sustain heterogeneity.
4.1.1. Opportunity awareness and resource acquisition
As discussed above, entrepreneurial cognition provides important insights for understanding why entrepreneurs often see and act on opportunities that others fail to recognize. Given
the differences in the way entrepreneurs think and make decisions, these differences may
lead to the development of some unique social interactions as well. More specifically, we
suspect that they use their “strength of weak ties” (Granovetter, 1982) to expose themselves
to a broader cross-section of people and situations that they in turn gives them the opportunity to extrapolate and make extensions regarding new venture opportunities. While the
nature of their social interactions tend to remain somewhat of an enigma, we suspect that part
of who they are (a resource) and a potential advantage in new venture creation. This
interaction provides them with substantial exposure to unusual and different ideas and
resources.
Information is an important part of the new venture process, and as noted above,
information that entrepreneurs use in the discovery process and in starting new ventures is
often nonlinear in nature. We suspect that involvement by entrepreneurs in distant and varied
social interactions facilitates the gathering of diverse, unusual, and sometimes specific
information. Their strengths of weak ties gives them exposure to chaotic bits of information
that sometimes get combined in usual ways and sometimes lead to new endeavors.
Furthermore, starting a new venture generally requires the accumulation of a variety of
resources with very limited financial capability (Brush, Greene & Hart, 2001). Here again we
suspect that the unique ways in which entrepreneurs think and expose themselves to a varied
cross-section of social interactions allow them to accumulate the necessary and sometimes
rare resources. Rare resources that an entrepreneur uses to create heterogeneous outputs may
often comprise of rarely used assets and their availability becomes known through the
entrepreneur’s diverse cross-section of acquaintances. Stated differently, the bootstrapping of
resources in an economical fashion that is so often necessary for a startup on a limited
budget, is in itself a rare and valuable resource that can be brought together through an
entrepreneurs diverse social connections.
4.1.2. The combining of resources
If we assume that entrepreneurship is as Schumpeter suggested, new production functions,
then firm heterogeneity is an outcome rather than a given (Rumelt, 1984). In a market view
throughout the process of resource rebundling information asymmetries are removed and “no
perceived opportunity for improving the allocation of resources is left ungrasped” (Kirzner,
1979, p. 235). Resource-based theory extends the product market view to include factor

<-----Page 14----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

769

markets and suggests that firms wishing to obtain expected above normal returns from
implementing factor market strategies must be consistently better informed about the future
value of those strategies than other firms in the same market (Barney, 1986).
During the process of rebundling resources waste occurs through knowledge imperfections. In the bundling of resources, entrepreneurs use their available information to make
decisions to produce a product that utilizes the available resources in a superior and more
efficient manner. The information and its application and know- how are available to the
entrepreneur through previous learning. The information owned by the entrepreneur is
deeply embedded, socially complex know-how of how to recombine resources and this
know-how combined with entrepreneurial decision-making is a source of firm heterogeneity.
4.2. Entrepreneurship and path dependency
Resource based distinctive assets in an entrepreneurial context may also be evolutionary.
In Schumpeter’s business cycle theory firms disrupting the cycle select new production
functions from a known bundle of current production functions. In other words the new
discoveries are path dependent. In this view heterogeneous assets may depend upon past
entrepreneurial decisions and these decisions made by founders and future firm entrepreneurial managers may be the DNA composition of the firm. Sustainable advantage is thus a
history (path) dependent process (Barney, 1991; Nelson & Winter, 1982). Barney (1987)
suggested that the role of chance and luck lead to the attainment of different superior
knowledge. We however contend that entrepreneurs are likely to develop different knowledge bases for coordinating their stocks of distributed knowledge because of their different
ability to learn and understanding of how things work. It is the different paths that firms take
that account for differential capabilities, and potentially firm heterogeneity. In entrepreneurial firms, because they are often newly founded and small in nature the decisions made will
have an impact on the future of the firm. Important sources of firm differences may surface
at this time in a firm’s history, sources such as patented technology and learning curves.
Because of the unique conditions under which entrepreneurial decisions are made, firm
specific skills and resource combinations may result in long-term path dependent implications for the firm.
In firms different people have different habits, thoughts, and models of the world that
present obstacles to the efficient coordination of their actions (Foss, 1999). Therefore, a
collective knowledge base is required for coordination (Penrose, 1959). This collective
knowledge base coordinates existing distributed knowledge but also coordinates intrafirm
learning processes. Indeed, coordinated knowledge bases help the firm organize a localized
discovery process. These choices are not necessarily obvious choices but instead are choices
that are determined by the initial founding conditions of the firm.
Still, if firms produce certain outputs using a given set of inputs over a long period of time,
these firms will not survive. To be successful for any length of time a firm must innovate
(Rumelt, 1987). Since innovation requires a certain amount of pre-existing capabilities
(Schumpeter, 1934), firms need to be able to learn. In order for firms to innovate the skills
and resources to sustain innovation must be present. Finally, innovation often leads to certain
other types of innovation that build on previous learning.

<-----Page 15----->770

5. Ex ante limits to competition
The last condition for a sustainable advantage is that there must be ex ante limits to
competition. In other words for a firm to enjoy a sustainable advantageous position there
must be limits to competition. As discussed above, Schumpeter’s business cycles start with
equilibrium and then the entrepreneur disrupts the cycle through innovation. Other less
capable entrepreneurs imitating the innovation and dissipating the competitive advantage of
the first firm then follow this disruption. Schumpeter (1934) called the down time a time of
depression.
However, if the entrepreneurial firm has resources that are causally ambiguous these
resources will be costly and difficult to imitate and the advantage enjoyed by this first firm
will not be dissipated. Causal ambiguity is a barrier to entry for potential competitors because
it is almost impossible to imitate a product that has ambiguous factors. In a Schumpeterian
competitive environment, firm survival is the capability to innovate, and to make that
innovation profitable again and again.
However, as firms get larger the costs of organizing additional transactions within the firm
may rise and the returns to the entrepreneurial function decrease (Coase, 1937). Once a firm
reaches the point where the cost of organizing an extra transaction becomes equal to the
market costs either the market will organize the transaction or a new entrepreneur will enter
and organize the new knowledge. Despite the survival problem with smaller firms, Coase
(1937) theorized that innovation and entrepreneurship are particular to the small firm.

6. Conclusion
We have examined the role of entrepreneurial resources within the RBT and advance
entrepreneurship theory by suggesting how these resources might be unique to entrepreneurship. By focusing on resources, from opportunity recognition to the ability to organize these
resources into a firm and then to the creation of heterogeneous outputs through the firm that
are superior to the market, we help identify issues that begin to address the distinctive domain
of entrepreneurship. We can also now begin to probe when the entrepreneurial firm a superior
choice to the market for the exploitation of new opportunities.
Within the field of entrepreneurship, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) have criticized the
work on small and new businesses and a focus on either the performance of individuals or
of the firm. They argue that a focus on firm performance is unique to strategic management
research and thus cannot be unique to entrepreneurship. Furthermore, they suggest that
performance approaches do not adequately test entrepreneurship because, “entrepreneurship
is about the discovery and exploitation of profitable opportunities” (Shane & Venkataraman,
2000, p. 217) and a focus on performance may exclude the analysis of the opportunity costs
of other alternatives.
While firm performance is an excepted paradigm in strategic management, performance
is also a nontrivial part of entrepreneurship research. Wealth creation, which in the case of
the firm is driven by firm performance, appears to be central to both entrepreneurship and
strategic management (Hitt, Ireland, Camp & Sexton, 2001). Recent research illustrates how

<-----Page 16----->S. A. Alvarez, L. W. Busenitz / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 755–775

771

entrepreneurship and strategic management inform each other and their overlapping interests, such as firm adaptation to environmental change, modes of organizing and the exploitation of opportunities (Venkataraman & Sarasvathy, 2001). Therefore to try to define the
distinctive domain of entrepreneurship by excluding that which also is studied by strategic
management is like a production of Romeo and Juliet with only one of them in the production
(Venkataraman & Sarasvathy, 2001). This is not to say that entrepreneurship and strategic
management should not continue seeking to clarify their specific domains. Indeed, some
entrepreneurship scholars are seeking to better identify the distinctive domain of entrepreneurship (e.g., Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Busenitz et al., 2001). Still, entrepreneurship
scholars should not “shy” away from an area of research simply because some researchers
are examining a question or theory in another discipline. Instead we in entrepreneurship need
to apply our own unique lens to the examination of these questions and theories.
This paper extends the efforts to better clarify the domain of entrepreneurship in two
important ways. First, we show how theory (RBT in this case) from another area of inquiry
can be a very helpful exploration tool for probing and better understanding entrepreneurship
related phenomena. We use RBT to show how entrepreneurship generally involves the
founder’s unique awareness of opportunities, the ability to acquire the resources needed to
exploit the opportunity, and the organizational ability to recombine homogeneous inputs into
heterogeneous outputs. Looking at these from a multiple levels of analysis perspective
involves significant truncation or problems with theory development. By analyzing these
different aspects of entrepreneurship as unique resources we resolve the level of analysis
problem and should facilitate better theory development. Furthermore, our development of
the entrepreneurship in RBT paves the way for addressing important research questions. For
example, one such question might be under what conditions is the firm the most efficient way
of exploiting economic opportunities identified by entrepreneurs?
Second, by looking at RBT through an entrepreneurial lens, we have extended the
boundaries of and enriched RBT. While others have made the connection between entrepreneurship and RBT (e.g., Chandler & Hanks, 1994; Brush et al., 2001), we have deliberately set out to develop the entrepreneurship side of RBT. In doing so, we shed new light on
how resources come into existence and how individuals sometimes embody bundles of
heterogeneous resources that allow them to repetitiously create new entrepreneurial opportunities through the firm.
Entrepreneurship researchers have sometimes pointed towards and hoped for a single
theory of entrepreneurship. Without a unified theory, it is assumed that the field of entrepreneurship will continue to be disjointed and a melting pot of diverse research positions. We
do not think that entrepreneurship necessarily needs a single theory because theory is not the
end but rather the means to an end. The focus of entrepreneurship researchers should be to
address interesting and important research questions that better explain and predict currently
vague phenomena. If a specific theory, regardless of its field of origin, is a tool that enables
us to better probe and explain a phenomenon of interest, then so be it. However, that when
using specific theory from outside the domain of interest, the boundaries frequently get
challenged or extended or the theory enriched, all of which can be important contributions.
We think that taking an entrepreneurial lens to the RBT as we have done in this paper
illustrates this two-way contribution.

<-----Page 17----->772

As a result of taking an entrepreneurial perspective, one contribution to RBT is that we are
now able to identify resources such as entrepreneurial alertness, insight, entrepreneurial
knowledge, and the ability to coordinate resources, as resources in their own right. Moreover,
distinctions have been made between RBT and knowledge theories of the firm and dynamic
capability theories, a characterization that RBT is Ricardian and not Schumpeterian (Carpenter, Sanders & Gregersen, 2001). However, we argue in this paper these distinctions are
artificial, knowledge and dynamic capabilities are an extension of the boundaries of RBT.
We take a Schumpeterian perspective to RBT by suggesting that the act of combining
homogenous and heterogeneous resources is a resource.

Notes
1. Strategic complementarities arise when the optimal strategy of an agent depends
positively upon the strategies of the other agents. Multiple equilibria and a multiplier
process may arise when strategic complementarities are present. Strategic complementarities arise from production functions, matching technologies, and commodity
demand functions in a multisector, imperfectly competitive economy (Cooper &
John, 1988).
