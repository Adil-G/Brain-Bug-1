This paper analyzes the decision process of venture capitalists. The study focuses on aligning the evaluation
uncertainty in the decision criteria of venture capitalists with the progress of the process. The reasoning
builds from the concept of search, experience and credence qualities, which was developed in the economics
of information and allows the identiﬁcation of the varying uncertainty of a single decision criterion compared
to other criteria, along with uncertainty variations throughout the process. Exploratory empirical evidence
suggests that in the early steps of the process in particular, management criteria are uncertain, while at the
end of the process other criteria couple with uncertainty.

1. Introduction
This research asks how venture capitalists organize their selection
and decision processes. Present academic literature on venture capital
ﬁnance analyzes the pre- and post-contracting phases of the venture
capital process in depth (for an extensive review cf. Wright et al.,
2003). With respect to the post-contracting phase, scholars discuss
such questions as the successful cooperation of venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs (Cable and Shane, 1997; Kollmann and Kuckertz, 2006),
monitoring of venture capital investments (Kaplan and Strömberg,
2003) and methods of adding value after reaching an investment
decision (Sapienza, 1992; Jain, 2001; Chen, 2009). Concerning the precontracting phase, several works identify the central steps of the
decision process (Wells, 1974; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Fried and
Hisrich, 1994), and determine the relative importance of particular
investment criteria to a ﬁnal decision (MacMillan et al., 1985; Muzyka
et al., 1996). In addition, Shepherd et al. (2003) and also Franke et al.
(2006) detect potential cognitive biases amongst venture capitalists.
This paper extends the ﬁrst two aspects of extant venture capital
theory with respect to the pre-contracting phase, that is, the study
integrates a process perspective with the theoretical knowledge of
investment criteria applied by venture capitalists. Such an integrative
and dynamic perspective can provide a more realistic venture capital
theory as well as addressing criticisms that prior studies have merely
collected empirical evidence about global investment criteria which is
only applicable to the complete investment process (Franke et al.
2006). Since numerous prior studies address the relevance of
particular investment criteria, this paper focuses on the speciﬁc
uncertainty associated with the evaluation of each single criterion and
analyzes how this uncertainty varies throughout the investment

process. Empirical knowledge about this uncertainty may then be the
basis for future instruments and strategies for managing a single
investment criterion depending on the progress of the investment
process.
This article develops its argument along the following lines. After
reviewing extant knowledge about venture capital ﬁnance, the paper
introduces the economics of information as a theoretical concept that
allows the identiﬁcation of evaluation uncertainty. Subsequently, the
paper explores the relationship between venture capital ﬁnance and the
economics of information. Next, the article presents the methodology
and results of an explorative empirical study among 81 venture
capitalists from German-speaking Europe. The paper concludes with
ﬁnal remarks that underscore the implications for efﬁcient management of the investment process and also shows how information about
evaluation uncertainty theoretically completes the existing knowledge
about the relevance of venture capital investment criteria.
2. Theoretical background
2.1. Venture capital investment process
The investment process of venture capital is part of the “venture
capital cycle” (Gompers and Lerner, 2000), and has not changed
signiﬁcantly since the ﬁrst academic studies in the 1970s (Wright
et al., 2003, p. XXIV). Over the complete cycle, venture capitalists raise
funds (fundraising), invest those funds in an investment process (deal
origination, screening, evaluation, structuring), manage their investments once an investment decision has been made (monitoring and
value adding), and eventually realize any proﬁts from their investments (exit).
Wells was one of the ﬁrst to describe the cooperation of the
venture capitalist and the entrepreneur in detail (1974). However,
scholars have paid more attention to Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) when

<-----Page 1----->742

conceptualizing the process. According to them, venture capitalists
invest in ﬁve distinct steps. In the ﬁrst step, deal origination, it is the
main task to discover promising investment opportunities. In the
second step, deal screening, the investor reduces the overabundance
of investment opportunities to a manageable quantity. In the third
step, deal evaluation, investors carefully analyze the potential
portfolio company. In the fourth step, deal structuring, venture
capitalist and entrepreneur clarify the terms of the deal between
themselves. The ﬁfth step, post-investment activities, combines all the
activities of venture capitalists that primarily aim at supporting the
company management and preparing future divestment. This early
systemization of the process still holds true, however, some authors
(Fried and Hisrich, 1994) propose a more sophisticated analysis of the
deal evaluation step, stating that it could be differentiated into a
cursory evaluation and a more formal due diligence (so-called ﬁrstphase and second-phase evaluation).
This paper provides an explanation of the selection and decision
mechanisms employed by venture capitalists, and is therefore
concerned with all of the above steps except the last (post-investment
activities). However, for pragmatic reasons, the study needs to concentrate on the most important steps in the investment process when
proceeding towards the empirical analysis. Given that this paper seeks
to integrate the investment process, investment criteria and evaluation
uncertainty with an empirical study of venture capitalists, the
following discussion focuses on the screening, the evaluation, and
the structuring phases. It is important to underscore that only
pragmatic reasons drive this shortened approach, and the reader
should not interpret its use as an alternative conceptualization of the
process. Rather, the study needs a sufﬁcient number of process steps to
facilitate an empirical process perspective and allow identiﬁcation of
variations in evaluation uncertainty of a single investment criterion —
for instance, by comparing early and late phases of the process. Against
this background, the question emerges, on what criteria do venture
capitalists actually base their decisions about an investment during the
process?

are related to the personality or experience of the entrepreneurs.
Moreover, those authors emphasize the fact that investment criteria
usually fall into ﬁve categories: the personality of the entrepreneur,
the experience and qualiﬁcations of the entrepreneur, the product/
service, the market and ﬁnancial considerations. Muzyka et al. (1996)
provide some evidence that European venture capitalists, especially,
attach importance to management team criteria rather than the
characteristics of the lone entrepreneur. According to these authors,
product and market criteria are only of average importance, while
criteria of the fund and the respective terms of a deal's structure are of
minor importance.
Similar to the pragmatic reduction of process steps introduced
above, the overabundance of known investment criteria forces
researchers to conﬁne themselves to just the most relevant. Venture
capital literature features plenty of possible investment criteria, and
due diligence checklists may well include up to 400 different criteria.
Unfortunately, it is rarely feasible to use such a comprehensive
catalogue of investment criteria in an empirical study; this paper
concentrates on 15 important investment criteria, listed in Table 1.
Despite the reduced number of criteria, this is a catalogue that a
venture capitalist would most likely perceive as largely complete. The
study achieves this goal by concentrating on the categories that
MacMillan et al. (1985) suggest, assigning three important investment
criteria to each category. This assignment was conducted with the
explicit goal of achieving the greatest possible approximation to a
complete catalogue of investment criteria. It only considered investment criteria proven to be of signiﬁcance for actual decision making in
at least two prior empirical studies. Participants in the pretest (see
below) of our empirical study thought this catalogue to be near
complete, but did however, opt for the introduction of one additional
criterion that reﬂects the appropriateness of an entrepreneur's
character for venture capital as a speciﬁc form of entrepreneurial
ﬁnance, and distinguishes innovative and ambitious entrepreneurs
pursuing growth-oriented business models (Morris et al., 2005) from
entrepreneurs operating, for instance, mom and pop businesses. The
new criterion proved to be of relevance in all pretests.

2.2. Venture capital investment criteria
Venture capital researchers frequently address questions of
venture capitalists' investment behavior, along with due diligence
and its related issues, by focusing on venture capitalists' investment
criteria. Empirical studies of the decision making behavior of venture
capitalists suggest that characteristics of the entrepreneur and the
entrepreneurial team are of the utmost importance: The inﬂuence of a
management team's quality on venture performance is not merely a
cliché popular with venture capitalists; it is also supported by various
empirical studies. For example, the seminal study by MacMillan et al.
(1985) proposes that ﬁve of the 10 most important decision criteria

2.3. Search, experience and credence qualities as a theoretical point of
reference
Every decision of a venture capitalist on an investment proposal is
primarily a decision about the quality of that proposal. Therefore,
further analysis requires a theoretical framework that allows us to
classify investment proposals by the various choices made to evaluate
quality. However, a direct measurement of the uncertainty and the
amount of uncertainty accompanying a proposal's assessment – for
example, by utilizing direct questions and Likert-type scales – could
be quite problematic. For instance, when questioned directly, survey

participants are very likely to systematically rate their subjective
uncertainty as low so as not to appear incompetent. Hence, this study
resorts to a concept taken from the economics of information that will
be introduced below: the concept of search, experience and credence
qualities (SEC qualities).
SEC qualities provide a suitable theoretical framework for the
indirect measurement of subjective evaluation uncertainty of different
goods (Nelson, 1970; Darby and Karni, 1973). This concept originates
in the economics of information (Kleinaltenkamp and Jacob, 2002;
Riley, 2001) and has proved valid in various empirical studies (e.g.
Brush and Artz, 1999; Miller, 2002), so researchers can rely on alreadyvalidated scales. The framework is of practical relevance as well, for
instance, in the United States the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
successfully applied the concept to regulate advertising activities
(Ford et al., 1988). Following the basic deﬁnition of this framework,
each and every type of goods may be described by three different
qualities (Darby and Karni, 1973, p. 69): “Search qualities which are
known before purchase, experience qualities which are known
costlessly only after purchase, and credence qualities which are
expensive to judge even after purchase.” Taken together, every good
can be considered to be a combination of these three basic qualities.
As a matter of principle, SEC qualities are applicable to every
conceivable economic type of goods, and therefore also to a venture
capitalist's investment proposal. For instance, venture capitalists can
decide immediately to a large extent whether a venture operates in an
industry of interest (search quality); only later will they be able to
assess the actual work effort of the entrepreneur (experience quality).
On the contrary, the entrepreneur's concrete commitment towards
the venture will never be completely recognizable (credence quality).
It is important to note, however, that the attribution of qualities to
a given type of goods can never be objective (Ford et al., 1988; Adler,
1996), but rather results from the subjective perspective of the
demand-side (in this case, the venture capitalist). Since every type of
quality relates to a different degree of ratability, it becomes evident
that there is a hierarchy of qualities that depends on the respective
level of evaluation uncertainty (Adler, 1996): goods primarily
determined by search qualities are associated with only a low degree
of evaluation uncertainty, while goods determined primarily by
credence qualities are associated with a comparatively high degree
of evaluation uncertainty. Experience qualities, however, have an
evaluation uncertainty located somewhere in between search and
credence qualities.
Earlier empirical studies on SEC qualities tend to collect global
judgments about relatively simple goods (for example bicycles or
furniture, Nelson, 1970), thereby reducing the complexity of real
transaction processes. As a result, the economics of information
literature now frequently calls for studies focusing on the relation
between SEC qualities and certain attributes of the respective goods to
provide a more complete picture (Adler, 1996). In analyzing the
investment proposal of a venture capitalist, this approach becomes
necessary, because the particular attributes of a potential investment
are commensurate with the investment criteria of venture capitalists —

743

all of which carry different levels of uncertainty. Of course, such an
approach implies a catalogue of criteria that is as complete as possible
and valid for all enquirers. With venture capital ﬁnancing, the results of
several empirical studies logically form such a catalogue for the
purposes of the present research project (see Table 1). All in all, SEC
qualities are a suitable theoretical concept to identify the evaluation
uncertainty not only of a complete investment proposal, but of a
particular investment criterion as well. Moreover, given its threedimensional character, the concept allows more complex analyses in
comparison to more traditional approaches. Therefore, this study will
apply this concept to venture capitalists' investment criteria in the
following section while simultaneously considering the process
character of every venture capital investment.
2.4. Venture capital ﬁnance from the perspective of search, experience
and credence qualities
Earlier studies on the relevance of investment criteria lead to the
conclusion that the impact of a single criterion on an investment
decision is not stable; rather criteria will change depending on a given
market situation or on the level of experience of a given venture
capitalist. Furthermore, empirical ﬁndings indicate that at least some
criteria are determined by the target industry of the venture capitalist;
for instance, the scientiﬁc reputation of the founding team seems to be
of greater importance when ﬁnancing biotech ventures than it would
be in other industries (Champenois et al., 2006).
Similar assumptions can be made about the evaluation uncertainty
of investment criteria that are at the very heart of this study, which
assumes that different criteria show different degrees of evaluation
uncertainty at different points in the investment process. Such
differences are caused by
• the subjective assessment of criteria by individual venture
capitalists,
• different amounts of resources being allocated to the evaluation of
an investment proposal and
• different levels of information that develop in the course of the
venture capital process.
For instance, it is deﬁnitely easier to ascertain that a certain
company is targeting a market that is of interest to the venture
capitalist, than it is to assess the potential market acceptance of
innovative products for which entrepreneurs seek funding in order to
develop a prototype. Equally, it is fair to assume that venture
capitalists perceive a higher degree of evaluation uncertainty at the
beginning of the process with an unfamiliar venture than at the end of
the process. Therefore, venture capitalists' investment criteria carry
different levels of evaluation uncertainty. This evaluation uncertainty
is reﬂected through SEC qualities and changes with the progress of the
investment process. Fig. 1 illustrates how evaluation uncertainty, SEC
qualities and the dynamics of the venture capital process are related to
each other.

This paper develops its arguments against the background of
research results on one key group of criteria — the management
(team) criteria. Several studies have found that venture capitalists
ascribe exceptional relevance to this group of criteria. Sayings such as
“I invest in people, not in ideas” underscore these ﬁndings, which, to a
great extent, go back to the signiﬁcant contribution of the entrepreneur to the potential success of every venture (Stuart and Abetti,
1987). An additional explanation can be found in the difﬁculty venture
capitalists experience in evaluating these criteria. The opportunity
costs of the entrepreneur, along with asymmetric information, are
possible reasons for the difﬁculties in evaluating management criteria.
Opportunity costs are of relevance for the actual behavior of both
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and can be the cause of
uncooperative behavior on both sides (Cable and Shane, 1997). For
entrepreneurs, there is the risk that venture capitalists may terminate
the venture because of a more attractive market opportunity. It is
equally complicated to decide whether entrepreneurs are willing to
carry the risk of a venture because they believe in the success potential
of the project, or because they see only very low opportunity costs, for
example, for reasons of incompetence and missing qualiﬁcations
(Gifford, 2003, p. 48).
Asymmetric information is a second reason for possible evaluation
uncertainty. As Gompers and Lerner (2000, p. 3) point out, “Venture
investors typically concentrate in industries with a great deal of
uncertainty, where the information gaps among entrepreneurs and
investors are commonplace,” and where venture capitalists cannot
directly observe the larger part of the entrepreneurs' competencies
and motivation. As investors often do not adhere to non-disclosure
agreements (Cable and Shane, 1997, p. 149), entrepreneurs may tend
to withhold critical information, for example, about speciﬁc aspects of
the venture's technology; moreover, they may withhold negative
information so as not to make funding (or the continuation of the
venture) impossible. Similar reasons apply to the danger of entrepreneurs exaggerating the potential performance of the venture.
Consequently, this study proposes that management criteria carry
excessive evaluation uncertainty, given that appropriate methods to
assess the character and competencies of entrepreneurs seeking
venture capital still seem to be missing (Smart, 1999). From an
economics of information viewpoint, this study therefore concludes
that the evaluation uncertainty of management criteria relates to a
disproportionate amount of perceived credence qualities.
3. Method
3.1. Research design
The empirical study is based on a standardized written survey
instrument. The questionnaire measures a respondent's ability to
evaluate an ideal-type investment proposal at various hypothetical
points in the investment process. For pragmatic reasons, we refrained
from including each and every step of the previously introduced
process model, in order to not overload the respondents (completing
the whole questionnaire required approximately 30 minutes of an
individual respondent's time). Survey participants were asked to
recall three different steps of the process — the screening, the
evaluation and the structuring phases (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). For
each stage of the process, survey participants were asked to provide

their assessment of the 15 investment criteria that prior studies had
proved to be of relevance. SEC qualities were measured based on
scales suggested and validated by Ford et al. (1990) and Adler (1996)
(see Table 2). Using this approach, it is possible to consider the
dynamic component of the investment process and to identify
possible changes in perceived evaluation uncertainty between the
selected points in time.
Following the development of the research design, the questionnaire was extensively pretested. This pretest was designed as an
iterative process; rather than conducting the pretest simultaneously
with several test participants, the chosen method was to gather
insights from each trial and incorporate them into a new, improved
version of the questionnaire to be tested again. In order to shed light
on the content reliability of the questionnaire, researchers conducted
six pretests with a diverse group of test respondents that included
early-stage and expansion-stage investors, as well as independent and
captive investors. Each iteration eliminated unsuitable question
formats and substituted new formats – after four of six possible
iterations, the survey instrument was of sufﬁcient reliability to start
data collection.
3.2. Data collection and sample
Venture capital investment managers from German-speaking
Europe, that is Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, contributed the
data (n = 81). At the time of data collection there were approximately
300 venture capital ﬁrms which were included in the membership
directories of three national professional associations which had
recruited nearly all active venture capital ﬁrms. These associations
are: the German Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVK),
the Austrian Private Equity and Venture Capital Organization (AVCO)
and the Swiss Private Equity and Corporate Finance Association
(SECA). The second step was to identify those individuals within each
ﬁrm who were sufﬁciently familiar with the venture capital process to
supply valid answers. Given that the focus of this study is on
individual rather than on organizational decision making, the authors
accepted multiple respondents per ﬁrm. Every individual received a
paper invitation mail and then follow up email reminders at intervals
of four weeks. The questionnaire was distributed with a cover letter
that explained the purpose of the study and clearly indicated the
responsible researchers and their institutional afﬁliation. Moreover,
the cover letter assured respondents that they would remain anonymous
and their answers would be treated as conﬁdential. At the end of the data
collection phase, 81 analyzable questionnaires had been received (9%
response rate), which is in line with similar studies on venture capital
ﬁnance (for example, Franke et al., 2006; MacMillan et al., 1985; Muzyka
et al., 1996). Comparison of early and late respondents by a MannWhitney U-test found no indication of non-response bias.
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive analysis
As with any other study, whether or not the collected data
represent a valid picture of the underlying population is important.
Whether the results are generalizable can at least to some extent be
concluded from the descriptive analysis of the available data set. The

univariate analysis results show that most of the responding venture
capitalists had a professional background in management (72.8%)
rather than in technology. For a study on the decision behavior of
venture capitalists it is vital to seek responses from experienced
venture capitalists (McNally, 1994, p. 280). The venture capitalists in
our sample were indeed experienced investors: they had a mean
professional experience (i.e. work experience post qualiﬁcation) of
13 years (SD = 8.39), of which they had spent 6.5 years (SD = 4.87) in
the venture capital industry; and more than three-quarters were
responsible for the total venture capital process. Therefore, on the
whole, it is safe to assume the survey participants were sufﬁciently
experienced. Of the respondents, 79% work in German ﬁrms, which
were, on average, established in 1997; the remaining 21% were based
in Austria and Switzerland. These venture capital ﬁrms had average
funds of €80 million under management, which is comparable to
volumes usually reported in the European setting (German Venture
Capital Association, 1994–2006). The same applies to the range of
investment size: venture capitalists in our sample sought investments
of between €1 million and €5 million. The analysis of the preferred
target industries revealed that investors are interested in ﬁrms
operating in the digital economy (“communication technologies”
and “computer related” each scored more than 50%), mostly ignoring
ﬁrms operating in saturated markets sectors like retail. Overall, the
data show no sign of bias that would prevent generalizing these
ﬁndings to German-Speaking Europe.

745

cantly from the global distribution, allowing for more sophisticated
conclusions on a criterion's evaluation uncertainty. This permits
conclusions about which criteria are, due to their better or worse
ratability, related to a lower or higher level of uncertainty. Moreover,
by comparing data from the three different process steps, it is possible
to identify the varying evaluation uncertainty throughout the process.
Towards the end of the process in particular the data are not
distributed normally, so the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Test is used
to test for signiﬁcant differences. Table 4 summarizes the results of
this test and indicates the deviation of every investment criterion, as a
percentage, from the aggregated global assessment of SEC qualities at
a given stage of the venture capital process. We suggest that the
results should be interpreted in one of two ways:
• Venture capitalists perceive a criterion that shows a signiﬁcantly
higher amount of credence qualities, along with a signiﬁcantly lower
amount of search qualities or experience qualities, as more
uncertain than average.
• Venture capitalists perceive a criterion that shows a signiﬁcantly
lower amount of credence qualities, along with a signiﬁcantly higher
amount of search qualities or experience qualities, as less uncertain
than average.
That is, for the existence of an uncertain investment criterion, not
only must higher credence qualities be perceived at a certain point of
the process, but the two remaining SEC qualities need to be perceived
to a signiﬁcantly lower degree. Moreover, to avoid a potential type I
error (false positive ﬁndings), this study only accepts results that are
signiﬁcant at the 0.001 level.
As a result, two criteria are signiﬁcantly easier to evaluate than the
others in the screening phase. One is the innovativeness of the
venture's product/service, which shows approximately 10% fewer
credence qualities and more than 6% higher experience qualities
compared to the global assessment. That is, venture capitalists are, at
the beginning of the investment process, already quite sure that they
will be able to decide whether the degree of innovativeness meets
their requirements. The other, and even better evaluable, is whether
an investment proposal ﬁts in with the venture capital ﬁrm's overall
investment strategy. The credence qualities of this criterion are about
20% less than average, while the search qualities exceed the average by
a similar amount.
These two criteria can be contrasted with four other criteria that
are, at the beginning of the investment process, of more than average
uncertainty. In particular, the entrepreneur's commitment proves to
be problematic, because it is related to more than 14% higher credence
qualities. These diverging credence qualities are associated with
signiﬁcantly lower search and credence qualities (-6% and −9%,

4.2. Evaluation uncertainty
This section relates the venture capital process and investment
criteria by pinpointing the evaluation uncertainty of a single
investment criterion depending on the progress of the process. In
addition to applying the economics of information to the phenomenon of venture capital ﬁnance, the study attempts to explain the
evaluation uncertainty of management criteria. Table 3 provides the
distribution of SEC qualities of an ideal-type investment proposal,
broken down into 15 different investment criteria. The percentages
indicate the amount of a particular SEC quality that respondents
perceive at a given stage of the venture capital process. For instance, in
the screening stage the overall ﬁt of the proposal to the investment
strategy of the venture capital ﬁrm is characterized by 39.4% search
qualities, 50.0% experience qualities and 10.6% credence qualities.
In order to discover the relative uncertainty of a single criterion,
the paper compares the respective assessments with the aggregated
global assessment, which is obtained by calculating the arithmetic
mean across all singular assessments. In this way the study identiﬁes
those criteria with distributions of SEC qualities that differ signiﬁ-

***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05. Negative numbers indicate a relatively lower amount of a particular SEC quality compared to the overall assessment at a given stage of the venture

respectively). The entrepreneur's leadership capabilities are almost
equally hard to evaluate (−5% search qualities and +6% credence
qualities). Market acceptance turns out to be even more difﬁcult with
respect to evaluation uncertainty: this criterion is accompanied by
approximately 5% lower search qualities and approximately 9% higher
credence qualities. Lastly, the assessment of potential return on
investment is complicated by more than 13% higher credence
qualities.
When progressing to the evaluation phase, this picture changes
dramatically. While in earlier phases of the investment process,
management criteria (particularly criteria with respect to the
personality of the entrepreneur) were especially challenging for
venture capitalists, they now adjust to the global assessment. Market
acceptance and return on investment continue to be problematic
criteria, while the ﬁt to the ﬁrm's investment strategy continues to be
signiﬁcantly better evaluable. Only one new criterion turns out to be
only marginally more easily evaluable: the patentability of the
product/service, with slightly lower credence qualities (−2%) and
higher experience qualities (+8%).
After the transfer to the structuring phase, results change only
marginally. Investment criteria that had been identiﬁed as critical
remain uncertain (market acceptance, return on investment) and
criteria that were found in the middle of the process to be better to
evaluate (patentability, ﬁt to investment strategy) are complemented
by only one new criterion being better evaluable than average: the
entrepreneur's track record is characterized by about 5% higher search
qualities and 5% lower credence qualities. Controlling for the
professional and the venture capital experience of survey participants,
their position in the venture capital ﬁrm (top decision maker vs.
investment manager) and the preferred investment industries did not
result in signiﬁcant differences.
5. Conclusion
Studies addressing venture capital decision making – especially
studies from the 1980s and early 1990s – have occasionally been
criticized. In particular, academics have questioned the validity of
studies relying on retrospective questioning, self-completed questionnaires (as compared to observation of authentic decision
processes) and direct reporting of decision makers (for an overview
cf. Shepherd, 1999a, p. 622). These methods can lead venture
capitalists to report how they believe they decide, instead of reporting
how they actually reached decisions. When questioned directly,
venture capitalists tend to over-stress criteria irrelevant to day-to-

day business, while under-stressing signiﬁcant criteria concerning the
proﬁtability and survivability of a given venture. Eventually, researchers have to admit that the analysis of the relevance of a particular
decision criterion is only partially pertinent to the successful
management of the investment selection process. This is because
the factors that make a venture capital investment successful do not
necessarily need to be congruent with actual decision criteria.
Although there are frequent calls in the academic literature for studies
to establish a direct link between investment criteria and success (for
example, Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Franke et al., 2006), empirical
results on this relationship are still missing. Consequently, studies of
investment criteria have, up to now, been of more interest to
entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding than they have to
venture capitalists looking for appropriate investment criteria. Studying the evaluation uncertainty of investment criteria as the present
study does is therefore an important step on the way towards linking a
single criterion to its contribution to the success of an investment
decision.
However, like all research, this paper is not without limitations.
The study's focus on German-speaking Europe presumably prevents
generalizing the results to other parts of the world; however, the data
at-hand potentially adds to a global perspective on venture capital.
Second, the study's focus on the individual level impedes generalizing
the results to the organizational level, since larger venture capital
ﬁrms might be included to a more than proportionate amount in the
sample. Last, while our approach allows to identify excessive and
moderate levels of uncertainty, it does not allow to identify threshold
values above which venture capitalists would feel uncomfortable with
a particular investment criterion's uncertainty and below which the
level of uncertainty would be perceived as acceptable. Moreover,
descriptions of the venture capital process still need to be linked to
actual investment performance. Future research efforts could build on
this by investigating the dynamics of the venture capital process in
research settings that would be even more authentic. Nonetheless,
from this paper's empirical ﬁndings several implications for actual
management result are worth considering. These implications should
prove relevant for both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
With respect to entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding,
this paper may lead to an improved collaboration between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Every criterion utilized in this study was
extremely relevant in some prior study. Entrepreneurs can now aim to
provide exactly the information at the right point in time that most
minimizes the uncertainty of venture capitalists. Such an approach
has the potential to simplify capital acquisition. For instance,

<-----Page 6----->T. Kollmann, A. Kuckertz / Journal of Business Research 63 (2010) 741–747

entrepreneurs should signal their readiness and commitment to the
intended venture from the very beginning of the process in the most
credible way. Postponing this to a later phase of the process heightens
the risk that this part of the process will not be reached, because the
negotiations will have already been terminated by the venture
capitalist.
For venture capitalists, view the results in conjunction with the
extant knowledge about the relevance of criteria (for example, Franke
et al., 2006; MacMillan et al., 1985). Venture capitalists should
particularly stress those investment criteria that have proved to be of
high relevance and, at the same time, of high uncertainty. Above all,
management criteria are of utmost importance in view of the fact that
they not only inﬂuence a venture's future success, but, at the same
time, are extremely hard to evaluate. Given these ﬁndings, comprehending why this part of the evaluation sometimes follows a purely
intuitive manner in practice is difﬁcult.
Future research can build on the combination of investment
process and investment criteria. The determination of different
degrees of uncertainty of different criteria by means of the SEC
qualities turned out to be particularly useful, and a great potential
exists for deeper analysis in this direction. For instance, relating
strategies to reduce the uncertainty of each criterion would be
worthwhile. Within the economics of information, a rich set of tools,
such as screening and signaling activities on the demand and supply
sides (Riley, 2001), are available to make uncertainty more manageable. Consequently, if venture capital research were to consider a
criterion's relevance and its uncertainty at the same time, the research
would be one step closer to the development of a theoretically
grounded evaluation tool for venture investment.
