The market for informal venture capital is an elusive and nearly invisible
source offinancing for entrepreneurial ventures. This marker consists of a
diverse set of high ner worth individuals (business angels) who invest a
portion of their assets in high-risk, high-return entrepreneurial ventures.
The emerging consensus of the characrerisrics of the individual investor is
that of a well-educated, middle-aged individual with considerable business
experience and a substantial net worth. These informal investors appear to prefer investing in the early
start-up stage of the venture and, if given a choice, prefer that their investments be located close to
home. One consequence of this consensus
is the tendency to assume that the traits of these business
angels are as rightly clustered around the norm as are the traits of venture capital finds. They are not.
In terms of their competence in the many areas of venture investing, these individual investors range
ffom the successfil, cashed-out entrepreneur on the one hand to individuals with little or no experience
with venture investing on the other. At the same rime, little is known about the characrerisrics of high net
worth individuals who never ventured where angels dare lo tread, or about these non-angels’
propensity to join the fold. Thus, this study seeks tofill the void by examining the characteristics of high
net worth individuals regardless of their investment history or their interest in venture investing.
An analysis of rhe data reveals three groups of high net worth individuals: business angels with
experience investing in entrepreneurial ventures, interested potenrial investors with no venture
investment history but who express a desire to enter the venture investment market, and uninterested
potential investors who under no circumstances would consider investing in entrepreneurial ventures as
purr of their investment strategy. Business angels and porenrial investors (both the interested and
non-interested segment) share similar views about the economic significance of the entrepreneur and
the diflculty in securing the equity capital for developmenr of the venture. As the issues move ffom the
general to the specific, divergence in investment attitudes takes place among the two groups, but this
divergence is in terms of magnitude or intensity, rather than in contrasting or opposing views of the

process. The potential investor tends to view investing in entrepreneurial ventures on a smaller scale
than the active investor, especially in terms of the dollar amount committed to any one investment. While
the business angel is more interested than the potential investor across all stages of financing, the
interest for both groups increases as the type offinancing progresses from the seed stage to expansion
financing. In contrast, the potential investor is more likely to seek diversification as a motivation for
venture investing than their angel counterparts.
The potential investor pool is segmented into those potential investors who appear willing to take
on the role of business angels and those individuals who have no desire to participate in the venture
market. For the interested group to increase their interest in providing venture capital, these potential
investors want assistance in monitoring the performance of the venture investment, followed by
assistance in pricing and structuring. Both of these resources relate more to the technical aspects of
venture investing and indicate that these are the areas where the potential investor is least likely to have
expertise. Other resources, such as finding and evaluating the investment opportunity, appear to
represent less of a stimulus for the potential investor. In many respects, interested potential investors act
like business angels across several dimensions. Both consider the later stages of the development of the
venture as the preferred stage to invest. The business angel and interested potential investor prefer
investments to be located relatively close to their primary residence and share similar views on the
amount of the investment portfolio to allocate to venture investing. Where the interested potential
investor and business angel clearly difSer is on the scale of the commitment and the motivation for
investing. The potential investor will commit a smaller dollar amount to any one venture, is more
inclined to participate with other investors, and is more apt to see venture investing as a diversification
strategy than is the seasoned business angel.

INTRODUCTION
Interest in the role of the informal investor in the venture capital market has increased steadily
since the identification of the business angel as a source of capital (Seymour and Wetzel 198 1;
Wetzel 1982). This informal venture capital market consists of a diverse set of high net worth
individuals (business angels) who invest a portion of their assets in high-risk, high-return
entrepreneurial ventures. In an attempt to understand this elusive and nearly invisible market,
researchers examine informal investing from a variety of perspectives, which generally
include three principal areas of study: market characteristics, investor characteristics, and
information channels. Each of these research areas has used a variety of methodological
designs, although the vast majority of the studies rely on some form of survey approach. The
objective of the present study is to add to the knowledge base by more broadly defining the
high net worth individual and by attempting to reach these individuals through a random
sample that does not rely on the investment history of the individual.
In the context of market characteristics,
researchers are primarily interested in
determining the size and structure of the informal risk capital market. In determining market
characteristics, studies typically rely on investee corporations as a means of identifying the
informal investor (Aram 1987, 1989; Freear and Wetzel 1990; Gaston 1989; Gaston and Bell
1986; Ruhnka and Young 1991) by using a random sample of firms from an existing data
base, with the firms providing the information on the informal investor. In many of these
studies, market structure is examined by comparing the activities of individual investors with
those of venture capital firms. Using an alternative approach, Sullivan and Miller (1990)
apply financial theory to the informal investor market.
Data describing the channels through which information about investment opportunities
is transmitted can be found in several studies. Without exception, these studies cite the
dominant role of informal networks of trusted friends and business associates in the
referral/search process. Noteworthy in this informal network is the existence of lead investors,

<-----Page 2----->INVESTORS IN THE INFORMAL VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET

whose recommendations
are often accepted and acted upon by other investors (Baty 1964;
Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 1990; Shaper0 1983). In addition, other researchers have
documented not only the significance of informal investors but also regional differences in the
effectiveness of these networks (Hoffman 1972; Krasner and Tymes 1983; Seymour and
Wetzel 1981).
Several researchers attempt to understand the informal risk capital market by identifying
the characteristics of the individual investor. The emerging consensus is a well-educated (at
least a college degree), middle-aged
(45-50 years) male with considerable
business
experience and a substantial net worth (Aram 1987; Freear and Wetzel 1989; Gaston and Bell
1988; Haar, Starr, and MacMillan 1988). A majority of these investors have entrepreneurial
experience as owners or managers (Gaston and Bell 1988; Postma and Sullivan 1990). These
informal investors appear to prefer investing in the early start-up stage of a venture and, if
given a choice, prefer that their investments are located relatively close to home in terms of
geographical distance. Although individual investors tend to invest in early-stage deals, their
exit horizons appear to be the same as the generally later-stage venture capital fund deals
(Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 1990). The majority of investors take on an active role in their
investments, usually in the form of membership on a venture’s board of directors, some less
structured consulting role or more formalized part-time employment with the venture (Gaston
and Bell 1988; Postma and Sullivan 1990). Several studies have presented data using investor
profiles as a means of differentiating among informal investor types, although little consensus
has been achieved in this area (Aram 1989; Gaston 1989; Sullivan 1991).
One consequence
of this consensus is the tendency of recent research to assume,
implicitly, that the traits of individual venture investors (business angels) are as tightly
clustered around the norm as are the traits of venture capital funds. They are not. In terms of
their competence to find, evaluate, price, structure, monitor, add value and exit venture deals,
individual venture investors range from successful, cashed-out entrepreneurs on the one hand
to individuals with little or no experience with venture investing on the other. At the same
time, little is known about the characteristics of high net worth individuals who never
ventured where angels dare to tread or about these non-angels’ propensity to join the choir, so
to speak.
Although the research in informal investing has progressed steadily, there are several
gaps in the existing knowledge base. Most notable among these gaps is the issue of survey
methodology
and, consequently,
the inclusion of only active informal investors in the
subsequent analysis. In particular, the majority of studies use a survey approach that is based
either on a convenience sample or a random sample of firms as a means of identifying the
informal investor. In the former case, the use of a convenience
sample precludes the
possibility of obtaining reliable statistical estimates of the target population. For those studies
that use a random sample, the typical procedure is to choose a sample of firms according to
some pre-determined stratification. The firms in turn provide the contact for those individuals
that invested in the particular venture, a procedure that results in too narrow a definition of the
informal investor. Thus, in both instances, the investment history of the individual is the
primary vehicle for identification of the sample respondent. In the present study, a broader
definition of the high net worth individual is utilized as the basis for a random sample. In
particular, the research examines the characteristics of high net worth individuals regardless
of their investment history or their interest in venture investing. Thus, the sample includes
both individuals with experience in investing in entrepreneurial
ventures (business angels)
and those with no history in venture investing (potential investors).

SURVEY DESIGN
In order to identify high net worth individuals in a manner that is not dependent on the
individual’s investment history, the data source was the Real Estate Transfer Data Base
(Banker and Tradesman 1990). This data base consists of real estate transactions, including
the name and address of the buyer and the size of the mortgage, for the years 1982-1989 for
Connecticut and Massachusetts. High net worth individuals were identified as those whose
mortgage amount was in excess of $300,000, and this group was further subdivided into
mortgages between $3~,~
and $I,~,~,
and those in excess of $1 ,~,~.
The
purpose of this subdivision was to assure that those individuals in the extreme category (>
$l,OOO,OOO)
were adequately represented in the data base. While not a perfect measure of net
worth, the mortgage amount serves as a proxy since the ability to qualify for a mortgage in
excess of $300,000 is partially dependent upon the net worth of the individual. Although
those individuals not involved in a real estate transaction were excluded from the study, the
average yearly turnover rate of 20% in the residential market indicates that for the eight-year
period studied a reasonably diverse set of individuals should be represented. Based on the
criteria outlined above, and excluding all but residential transactions, 24,876 high net worth
individuals were identified, with 1,462 (6%) having a mortgage in excess of $l,OOO,OOO
and
the remainder (23,414 or 94%) in the $300,000 to $1 ,OOO,OOO
group. From this population of
high net worth individuals, 3,700 were randomly selected in proportions equal to the two
categories of mortgage size present in the population.
Each individual was sent a mail alert that explained the purpose of the study and
indicated that a questionnaire would follow in two weeks. Each questionnaire consisted of 43
questions that addressed investment attitudes and experience and required approximately 30
minutes to complete. One hundred eighty-four usable questionnaires were returned,
representing a 5%~response rate. Of the 184, 146 respondents had made venture investments
(business angels), and 38 respondents were high net worth individuals who had never
invested in entrepreneurial ventures (potential investors).

BUSHWSS ANGELS VS. POTENTIAL INVESTORS
Business angels and potential investors share similar general impressions concerning the
entrepreneur. Both groups consider the entrepreneur to be a significant player in maintaining
a competitive U.S. economy and at the same time view the obstacles as substantial for
early-stage ventures attempting to raise equity capital. However, as expected, an individual’s
general interest in financing entrepreneurial ventures is affected by their investment history,
with the potential investors expressing little or no interest in becoming involved in venture
investing. Thus, while recognizing the impo~ance and the difficulty in raising venture capital,
the potential investor shows little propensity to fuel this important economic engine.
As a means of understanding this angel/potential investor dichotomy, several areas of
investment attitudes are explored. While interest in financing ventures for both groups is, on
the surface, weak, the willingness to engage in financing reveals a different scenario. Table 1
summarizes the findings for investment allocation decisions. In Table 1, individuals are asked
to state the m~imum percentage of their total inves~ents that they would consider all~ating
to entrepreneurial ventures. As expected, the magnitude of the allocation is dependent on the
investment history of the individual (x2 = 54.85; p = .O). Those individuals with a history of
venture investing (business angels), demonstrate a greater willingness to finance ventures
than the potential investors. Specifically, 84% of the business angels would consider
allocating between 5 and 50 percent of their portfolios to entrepreneurial ventures. However,

for the potential investor, the allocation is higher than would be expected given the general
non-interest expressed by this group. Although 26% of the potential investors would not
consider investing any amount of their portfolios to entrepreneurial ventures, a solid 71% of
these individuals are willing to allocate between 1 and 14 percent of their total investments to
venture deals. Over half of these potential investors would consider investing between 5 and
14 percent of the portfolio. To investigate further this willingness to invest, individuals are
asked the size (in dollars) of an equity investment that they would normally commit to any
one entrepreneurial venture. While both groups of individuals prefer smaller investments, the
potential investors again demonstrate a more cautious approach (x2 = 28.14; p = .O). Over half
of the business angels would normally commit under $24,000 to any one entrepreneurial
venture, and 77% of the potential investors would limit their investment to under $10,000. In
addition, 27% of the business angels are willing to invest between $25,000 and $99,000 to an
entrepreneurial venture. Thus, based on the allocation of investments and the magnitude of
the investment, what on the surface appears to be a limited interest by both angels and
potential investors is more appropriately termed a cautious approach. While the individual
with a history of venture investing exhibits a slightly greater willingness to commit a larger
amount to financing ventures, both angels and potential investors prefer smaller deals.
Investment attitudes concerning the stage of financing are important in developing an
understanding of potential sources of funds during the growth of the venture. Respondents
were asked to express their interest in the following types of financing: seed, start-up,
early-stage expansion, and expansion financing for closely held established firms. Potential
investors exhibit an aversion to investing in the early development of a venture with only 14%
expressing some interest in seed financing and 23% for start-up financing. It is possible that
these responses are a reflection of the general low interest among potential investors, or a lack
of knowledge concerning the ability to evaluate an investment opportunity at such an early
stage of development, or a reflection of a more conservative approach to investing that would
be understandable
among potential investors. However, the angel responses to these
categories reflect substantially
less aversion to investing in the early development of the
venture with 35% expressing some interest in seed financing and 52% in start-up financing.
In contrast, interest in investing for both groups of individuals increases as the stage of the
financing progresses. For the business angel, those individuals expressing a strong interest
more than doubles from the seed to the expansion financing stage, and for the potential
investors the interest increases three-fold. Thus, both groups of high net worth individuals
appear to prefer investing in a firm in the later stages of development, leaving the entrepreneur
to search for other sources of funding at the critical seed and start-up financing stages.
Investment attitudes that address the lineaments of a venture investment add to the
development of a profile of investment attributes. Such a profile outlines what characteristics

the business angel prefers in a venture investment and how the potential investor’s perception
of these characteristics compares with the more experienced business angel. To add to the
development
of this investment profile, four attributes of the venture investment
are
investigated:
location, holding period, participation
with others, and diversification.
Individuals are asked to indicate where, in the future, will the entrepreneurial
ventures in
which they invest most likely be located. For this geographic characteristic, the location
preference appears not to be affected by the investment history of the respondent (x2 = 3.53;
p = .473). Both business angels and potential investors prefer ventures close to home, with
approximately half of each group stating a desire to invest in ventures located within 300
miles of their primary residence (Table 2). At least two possible explanations exist for this
finding. In one case, the result appears to support the theory of value added in that the investor
adds more to the venture than monetary assistance. With the ability to be within a day’s drive
of the investment, the angel or potential investor can assume the role of an active investor by
adding such nonmonetary assistance through board representation,
consulting, or possibly
working in some part-time capacity for the venture. An alternative explanation is that in order
to evaluate the potential of the venture investment, one needs to have knowledge of the
location of the venture to understand
the regional characteristics
of the investment
opportunity. Such factors as the labor pool, local and state demographics, and tax structures
would be clearly understood by those investors currently residing in the region. Note also
from Table 2 that once the venture is outside the 300-mile limit, nearly one quarter of the
angels and potential investors have no geographic limitation. It is assumed that this latter
group would not consider active participation in the venture as a criteria for investment.
With respect to holding periods, individuals are asked to state the length of time they
expect to hold a venture investment (Table 3). Angels and potential investors respond in a
similar manner (x2 = 1.07; p = .90). Both groups exhibit a similar view of the long-term nature
of investing in an entrepreneurial venture, with approximately 40% expecting to liquidate an
investment in three to six years. Nearly a quarter of the individuals do not consider the holding
period to be an important investment criteria. Thus, the seasoned investor and the novice
appear to be a patient group, willing to commit funds for a reasonable period of time in order
to allow the venture to develop and reach the full potential of the investment.
Participation with others in a venture investment is considered to be advantageous when
the investor lacks knowledge of the industry or of the characteristics of the entrepreneur.
Participation is also viewed as a source for locating potential venture investments. In this
regard business angels appear to be more knowledgeable of the advantages of investing with
other individuals. Over half of the business angels share a strong desire to participate with
others in venture investments. In contrast, the potential investor is equally divided among the
interest categories and demonstrates a tendency not to view participation with others as
beneficial or desirable. Specifically, nearly half of the potential investors have little or no

interest in participation,
but a third indicate a strong desire to be involved with others in
venture investments. This dichotomy among potential investors is explored in greater depth
in the following section.
The last investment attitude examined is a motivational
consideration
for investing.
Individuals are asked if diversification within their venture investment portfolio is a factor
that influences the investment decision. Since the potential investor is not currently holding
any venture investments,
diversification
may indicate a willingness to become an active
investor. Table 4 summarizes the results and indicates that a desire to diversify is not affected
by an individual’s
investment history (x2 = 5.0; p = .29). Business angels are evenly
distributed across the span of responses, indicating that diversification
does not necessarily
play a major role in the decision to invest. In contrast, 57% of the potential investors consider
diversification
as a factor that tends to influence
their investment
decision. Thus,
diversification appears to offer a possible enticement for the potential investor to move to the
role of business angel.
To recap, both business angels and potential investors share similar judgments about the
economic significance of the entrepreneur and the difficulty in securing the equity capital for
development of the venture. However, as the issues move from the general to the specific,
divergence in investment attitudes takes place among the two groups, but this divergence is
in terms of magnitude or intensity, rather than in contrasting or opposing views of the process.
That is, .the potential investors are not necessarily opposed to investing in entrepreneurial
ventures but rather tend to view the investment decision on a smaller scale than the active
investors. Along the dimension of size, the potential investor prefers to allocate a smaller
percentage of the investment portfolio to entrepreneurial ventures, as well as a smaller dollar
amount to any one venture. Considering the stage of financing, while the business angel
appears more interested in earlier stage financing than the potential investor, the interest of
both groups increases as financing progresses from the seed stage to expansion financing. In
evaluating the attributes of the venture investment, both angels and potential investors seek
investments that are close to home and are patient investors in terms of the holding period for
the investment. The investors differ in that business angels appear more willing to participate
with others in a venture investment but are less likely than the potential investor to seek
diversification as a motivation for venture investing.

SEGMENTED POTENTIAL INVESTORS
Individuals are asked if the availability of certain resources would increase their interest in
investing
in entrepreneurial
ventures. These resources include assistance in finding
investments,
evaluating
the merits and risks of investment
opportunities,
pricing and
structuring, monitoring the performance of the investment, participating with other investors,

and a reduction in the capital gains tax. The purpose is to determine what enticements, if any,
would induce the potential investor to become an active player in the venture market.
Examination of the response to these enticement questions indicates that the potential investor
may be classified into two groups, non-interested and interested potential investors. In the
first group, the general non-interest in investing in entrepreneurial ventures expressed by the
potential investor remains firm. The non-interested
group remains steadfast in their
opposition to venture investing, and as a group would not consider any of the stated resources
as a means of increasing their interest. The second group (interested potential investors)
differs substantially
from the first. These interested potential investors show a distinct
inclination towards assuming the role of business angel, albeit on a small scale, given the
proper enticements.
Table 5 summarizes the results for this grouping or segmenting set of responses. The
split between the two groups of potential investors is approximately equal, with 47% in the
interested potential investor pool and 53% remaining non-interested.
From Table 5, clearly
the interested group is different than the non-interest group across all six resource categories,
as shown by the differences in the mean response and the frequency distribution. The x2
values also indicate that the responses appear to be an adequate segmenting variable. For the
interested group, the frequency distribution
indicates that to increase their interest in
investing, these potential investors want assistance in monitoring the performance of the
venture investment, followed by assistance in pricing and structuring. Both of these resources
tend to apply to the more technical aspects of venture investing, and indicate that these are the
areas where the potential investor is least likely to have expertise. The remaining four
resources are approximately
equal in terms of their effect on increasing the interest in
investing.
As a means of ascertaining the willingness of these two potential investor groups to
engage in financing a venture investment, Table 6 summarizes the results for the allocation
decision. For Table 6 the individual potential investors are asked to state the maximum
percentage of their total investments that they would consider allocating to entrepreneurial
ventures. This maximum allocation decision appears to be affected by the degree of interest
(~2 = 14.51; p = .006). Surprisingly, even the non-interested group is willing to express a
non-zero amount as the maximum of their total investments that they would allocate to
entrepreneurial
ventures, with 60% of this group stating they would consider investing a
maximum of 1 to 14% of the portfolio. However, recall that because this group is generally
not interested (since available resources would not increase their interest), it would be difficult
to move this 60% actually to invest. In contrast, for the interested group, 89% would consider
investing a maximum of 1 to 24%. Not only is this percentage of non-zero allocation higher
than the non-interest
group (89% vs. 60%), since this interested group demonstrates a
willingness to increase its interest if certain resources are available, this 89% may reflect a

more accurate representation of the maximum amount it is willing to invest. That is, if you are
interested, or willing to have your interest increase, then you are probably more serious about
committing the stated maximum percentage of your investments to entrepreneurial
ventures
than if you are basically not interested. For this interested group of potential investors, this
initial investment in an entrepreneurial
venture is typically small. Sixty-one percent of this
interested group will normally commit under $10,000 to any one venture investment, and
28% are willing to commit between $lO,OOCl and $24,000. Thus, there appears to be a
substantial number of potential investors who are willing to enter the venture market by
investing a maximum of between 1 and 24% of their portfolio with a commitment of funds
typically under $24,000.
When both groups of potential investors are asked their investment plans, whether the
potential investor is interested or not is independent of their plans to invest in entrepreneurial
ventures in the next two years (x2 = 1.44; p = .23) Specifically, neither group is planning any
investment in the short-term, with 75% of the interested group and 90% of the non-interested
group responding that they plan zero entrepreneurial
venture investments in the next two
years. Thus, while an interest may be indicated, it will not come to fruition in any short period
of time. When queried concerning the level of interest according to the stage of financing
(seed, start-up, early stage, and expansion), the responses of the interested potential investors
parallel those of business angels outlined in the previous section. As the stage of financing
increases, the level of interest also increases. Also, as expected, the non-interested potential
investor remains not interested across the stages of financing.
Given the general characteristics of the size, timing, and stage components of the venture
investments, more specific dimensions of the investment attributes are compared across the
two groups of potential investors. For the type of venture investment, neither group is
particularly interested in technology-based
ventures. Only 18% of the committed potential
investors show an interest in technology-based
ventures with the remaining either indifferent
(24%) or expressing little or no interest (58%). Concerning the location of the venture
investment, the interested potential investor expressed sentiments similar to those of the
business angel. Over half of this interested group wish to invest in a venture located close to
home (within 300 miles), while a quarter have no geographic limitation. Thus, it appears that
these interested potential investors adhere to the notion of proximity providing either the
ability to add more than monetary assistance to the venture or a need to understand the
regional characteristics of the entrepreneurial investment.
Assuming that the potential investor has a cursory knowledge, at best, of the venture
investment market, it is hypothesized that this investor would view participation with other
investors as a means of mitigating the daunting responsibility of the due diligence process.

7 summarizes
the finding for this participation
dimension.
The willingness
to
participate with others is dependent on the interest level of the potential investor (x2 = 23.03;
p = JO). If the potential investor is not interested, then the chance to participate with others
does not appear to affect their interest. In contrast, the interested potential investor
demonstrates a willingness to participate with others, with a mean response of 3.9 versus a
mean response of 1.6 for the non-interested
group. Specifically,
65% of the interested
potential investors are willing to participate with others, with 29% being indifferent.
Considering the length of time that one normally expects to hold a venture investment,
the potential investor response again mirrors those of the seasoned business angel. For the
interested potential investor, over half expect to liquidate an investment within three to six
years, and nearly a quarter does not consider the holding period to be an important factor.
Thus, it appears that the interested potential investor is patient and has realistic liquidation
expectations. For the motivational dimension of those potential investors whose interest can
be increased, diversification
is clearly a factor in their investment decision. Seventy-seven
percent of the interested group state that diversification would have a strong influence in their
venture investment decision.
The purpose of the segmented
potential investor analysis was to discern the
characteristics of those potential investors who appear willing to take on the active role of
business angel as opposed to those individuals who have no desire to participate in the venture
market. Interested potential investors are, in many respects, acting like business angels across
several dimensions.
Both the interested potential investor and the active business angel
consider the later stages of the development of the venture as the preferred stage to invest.
Both groups also prefer these investments to be located relatively close to their primary
residence and share similar views on the amount of the investment portfolio to allocate to
venture investing. In addition, the interested potential investor and the business angel are
patient investors and are willing to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time before
liquidation. Where the interested potential investor and business angel clearly differ is on the
scale of the commitment and the motivation for investing. Specifically, the potential investor
will commit a smaller dollar amount to any one venture, is more inclined to participate with
other investors, and is more apt to see venture investing as a diversification strategy than is the
seasoned business angel. It appears that these potential investors are poised to take an active
role in venture investing, given the proper set of enticements. For the non-interested potential
investor, it appears that little or no movement can be expected from this set of high net worth
individuals.
For whatever reason, they do not view venture investing as a desirable or
attractive alternative to their current investment strategy.

EVALUATING THE NONRESPONSE

BIAS

Inherent in any mail survey is the potential for bias both from nonrespondents
or from
misidentification
of the target population. To assess the degree and impact of this inherent
bias, three strategies are adopted. To ascertain the quality of the original data base, the
responses, and the response rate, an additional survey is conducted six months after the
original survey. To address directly the nonresponse bias, a second strategy involves sending
a postcard to high net worth individuals, soliciting the reasons why the individual did not
respond to the survey. The third method for assessing the nonresponse issue is based on the
theory that persons responding later to a mail survey are assumed to possess similar
characteristics to nonrespondents
(Armstrong and Overton 1977).
The postsurvey (undertaken six months after the original survey) follows a survey design
identical to that of the original study except for two features. First, a smaller number (400) of
high net worth individuals are randomly selected from a target population of 987 individuals.
Second, the accuracy of the names and addresses of the 987 individuals are verified from the
current list of residents provided by the registrars of the towns.
The objective of the postsurvey is to provide a more accurate estimate of the response
rate and of the size of the angel and potential investor pool, since the target population is
verified from independent records. In addition, the postsurvey provides a mechanism for
verification of the responses for the larger (original) survey. For the postsurvey 39 usable
questionnaires were returned, representing a IO%-response rate, slightly higher than that of
the original survey. Of these 39, 26 (67%) respondents have made venture investments
(business angels) and 13 (33%) respondents are high net worth individuals who have never
invested in entrepreneurial ventures (potential investors). In comparison to the original study,
the relative size of these two investor pools is remarkably similar. In the original study
business angels represent 79% of the respondents, which is not statistically different from the
67% of the poststudy (p = .lO52).
To estimate the quality of the responses, a comparison is made between the original and
the postsurvey with respect to the characteristics of the angel and potential investor market.
Across several of these dimensions the responses between the two surveys are quite similar.
In both surveys, business angels’ attitudes, such as the percentage of the portfolio allocated to
venture investments, the size and location of the investment, and the length of holding period,
are essentially the same. These similarities also exist for the potential investor market. For the
segmented potential investors, both studies exhibit an equal proportion of potential investors
that may be classified as interested or not interested. In addition, the investment attitudes of
these segmented potential investors are similar across several dimensions when comparisons
are made between the original and postsurvey respondents.
In an attempt to elucidate the nature of the nonresponse bias, a postcard was sent to a
random sample of 400 high net worth individuals soliciting information as to why the
individual did not respond to the survey. Seventy-two postcards were returned, representing
an 18%-response rate. The respondents were given several alternative reasons from which to
choose for not completing the survey, including a section for comments. The most frequent
reason cited (70% of the respondents) is that the individual is not interested in investing in
entrepreneurial
ventures. This response supports the hypothesis presented earlier that the
nonrespondents
are members of the not-interested segment of the target population. This
segment remains steadfast in their opposition to venture investing and as such would not add
substantially to the knowledge base concerning the attitudes and characteristics of business
angels and potential investors. The next largest group of nonrespondents
(41%) state that
because they have never invested in entrepreneurial ventures they chose not to complete the

<-----Page 12----->INVESTORS IN THE INFORMAL VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET

121

survey. Of this 41%, 76% also claims they have no interest in investing in entrepreneurial
ventures. This group of nomespondents
represents the not-interested
potential investor
segment identified in the previous section. Thus, for the potential investor pool of high net
worth individuals,
the majority of the nonrespondents
appear to be of the not-interested
potential investor cluster. Therefore, the interested potential investor segment does not appear
to be substantially
affected by nonresponse bias. Further support for this conclusion is
evidenced by the number of respondents (37%) who indicate a lack of knowledge of venture
investing as the reason for nonresponse. While an absence of such knowledge does not
preclude providing meaningful responses to the original questionnaire, 74% of this group also
claims to not be interested in entrepreneurial investing. Since the focus of the current research
is on understanding the business angel and uncovering enticements to move the truly potential
investor into becoming an active player, the nonrespondents
do not appear to be members of
these two groups. An encouraging note from this sample of nonrespondents
is that only 12%
cite a concern about the confidentiality of their responses as the reason for not returning the
survey. This small percentage would imply that for those who did complete the survey, the
responses are quite likely to be open and honest and that the survey design succeeded in
conveying to the individual that the information collected would be treated in strictest
confidence.
To further assess the nonresponse bias, comparisons are made between individuals who
responded later to the original survey to those of the entire survey and to those individuals
who responded early during the return stream. Specifically, persons responding later to a mail
survey are assumed to possess characteristics similar to nonrespondents.
Any significant
differences that appear in these later respondents would indicate the presence of nonresponse
bias. An analysis of the timing of the returns of the survey indicates that a significant drop-off
in the daily return rate occurs 23 days after the initial mailing of the survey. Of the 184
surveys returned, 37 respondents (20%) fall into this late return category that provide the
estimates of the characteristics of nonrespondents.
Of these 37, 28 respondents (76%) have
made venture investments (business angels), and 9 respondents (24%) are high net worth
individuals who have never invested in entrepreneurial ventures (potential investors). Recall
that in the original study business angels represent 79% of the respondents, which is not
statistically different from the 76% of the late returns @ = .6818). Thus, with respect to the
angel-potential
investor dichotomy, there does not appear to exist a significant nonresponse
bias. This same conclusion holds in comparisons between the early and late returning groups.
To estimate the extent of nonresponse bias in the attitudes, behavior and characteristics of
high net worth individuals, comparisons between the late returns and the original survey and
early returns are made across several dimensions. In all groups, business angels and potential
investor attitudes concerning the percentage of the portfolio allocated to venture investments,
the size and location of the investment, the holding period, and the interest according to the
stage of the investment are essentially identical. For the segmented potential investors, the
early returns exhibit similar characteristics
with the original survey. More important,
however, is the fact that for the late return group, nearly 90% fall into the not interested
potential investor
segment, as opposed to the equal proportions
of interested
and
not-interested potential investors exhibited in the entire survey. This result provides further
support for the hypothesis that the nonrespondents
are predominately
members of the
not-interested potential investor segment. As such, the business angel and interested potential
investor clusters do not appear to be substantially affected by nonresponse bias.

CONCLUSION
The present study seeks to expand the knowledge base of individual

venture investing by
adopting a broad definition of the high net worth individual as the basis for a random sample.
To the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first attempt to examine the venture investment
attitudes of high net worth individuals regardless of their investment history or their interest
in venture investing. Thus, the sample includes both business angels with experience in
venture investing and potential investors with no history in investing in entrepreneurial
ventures. The mortgage amount of the individual’s primary residence serves as a proxy for net
worth. Since the results are based on individuals from one region of the United States, the
generalizability of the results cannot be assured. However, the characteristics of the business
angels in the study compare favorably with existing literature, lending support to the
conclusion that the sample is representative of the target population. Since data do not exist
on the potential investor, the representativeness
of this group cannot be completely
ascertained. However, the reasonableness
of the responses and their coherence with the
generally accepted notion of the potential investor add to the reliability of the sample.
Concerning the nonresponse
bias, based on the data and the analysis of a sample of
nonrespondents, it appears that the majority of nonrespondents are part of the non-interested
potential investor segment. Thus, data from this group would not substantially add to the
knowledge base.
An analysis of the data reveals three groups of high net worth individuals: business
angels with experience investing in entrepreneurial
ventures, interested potential investors
with no venture investment history but who express a desire to enter the market, and
uninterested potential investors who, under no circumstances, would consider investing in
entrepreneurial ventures as part of their investment strategy. The business angel and interested
potential investor are similar along several dimensions. Most notable of these findings is that
both groups of individuals prefer investing in entrepreneurial ventures that are in the later
stages of development. Thus, they wish to fuel the engine that is up and running but are not
interested in fueling the start of this economic engine. Angels and interested potential
investors also state a preference for investing in ventures that are located relatively close to
home. It is surmised that this location preference indicates that the individual wishes to be in
the position of providing non-monetary
assistance to the firm and, to a lesser extent, that
proximity may facilitate monitoring the performance of the venture and a knowledge of the
regional characteristics of the investment. In contrast to the business angel, the interested
potential investor appears to be more willing to participate with others in a venture
investment, will commit a more modest amount of funds, and views venture investing as a
vehicle for diversification.
Further research needs to be undertaken to uncover the attitudes, behavior, and
characteristics of high net worth individuals. One needs to understand not only how to keep
the business angel as an active investor but also the enticements required to move the potential
investor into becoming an active player. Perhaps the motivation for future research on the
business angel and potential investor is best described by this remark made by a fallen angel:
“Entrepreneurs
exhibit creativity and innovation. But . .. having been burnt already in
several ventures, I am reluctant to part with my hard earned money.”
