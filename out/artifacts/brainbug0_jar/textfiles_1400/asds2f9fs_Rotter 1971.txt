long last it seems that many thoughtful
people have become aware that the strongvalue conflicts in our society can no longer
be ignored and that radical change is necessary for
survival. Many have also recognized that change
in itself is not necessarily good and that change
that will produce a better society must be controlled
or planned. The atom bomb, the Asian war, the
college student, the hippie, the black revolutions,
and the problems of pollution and overpopulation
have helped even politicians see that our problems
have become deeper and that slogans and myths
will no longer suffice. Where many psychologists
have individually understood the serious and debilitating conflicts in society's values, most have preferred to follow more traditional, easier, or safer
lines of study rather than to probe deeply into these
culture conflicts and their consequences for personality development and social behavior. In recent
years, however, a continually increasing number of
social and personality psychologists have directed
their energies toward investigations of our social
ills. Tt is gratifying to observe the multiplication of studies of such problems as alienation,
trust, altruism, bystander intervention, vandalism,
Machiavellianism, and moral development.
Tf our society is to be improved, it will not come
about because one group or another has seized or
obtained power, but rather because social planners
and people in power will have access to knowledge
about how socially desirable traits or characteristics
are developed and maintained, and will make use
of that knowledge.

If it ever held sway, the morality of the ten
commandments now has little effect on public or
private behavior. Religion as a mass method for
the development of moral behavior seems to have
failed. Political creeds have lost their appeal, and,
for better or worse, it now seems to be up to
social scientists to provide the basis for a better
society. Our society seems to be falling apart, and
though it may be true that something better will
naturally arise from the shambles, the chances that
something better will develop may be materially
enhanced by the knowledge that the social scientist
may be able to provide. How successful we will
be in producing the knowledge and in guiding its
application is yet to be determined. The attempt
is surely worth the effort.
Jn accord with these remarks, I would like to
speak this afternoon on a series of investigations
in the field of interpersonal trust conducted by
myself and a group of students. This work has
been carried out over the past seven years but still
represents only a beginning. Most of the research
has concentrated on individual differences, and J
would like also to discuss in more theoretical terms
the nature of such differences and how their study
helps to clarify problems of broad social issues.
It is belaboring the obvious to discuss the significance of interpersonal trust in our society. It
seems clear that disarmament will not proceed
without an increase in trust on one or both sides
of the iron curtain, as Osgood (1960) pointed out
10 years ago. The entire fabric of our day-to-day
living, of our social order, rests on trust—buying
gasoline, paying taxes, going to the dentist, flying
to a convention—almost all of our decisions involve
trusting someone else. The more complex the society, the greater the dependence on others. I f trust
weakens, the social order collapses. The absence of
trust between government and the forces of law
and order and the groups seeking change in our
society has reached alarming proportions, and the
results are likewise alarming.
I am aware that it makes no sense to try to
rebuild trust in the absence of some social change.

However, the attempt to decelerate what appears
to lie increasing distrust and to built a society in
which people trust each other more may in itself
demand changes in the behavior of individuals and
groups that constitute positive social change.
Interpersonal trust is defined here as an expectancy held by an individual or a group that the
word, promise, verbal, or written statement of
another individual or group can be relied on.
I f such expectancies are generalized and constitute
a relatively stable personality characteristic, they
should be readily amenable to investigation. This
definition clearly departs significantly from other
uses of the concept of basic trust which is used in
a more general way, often synonymous with the
healthy personality or belief in the goodness of
others.
I will not attempt here to review the extensive
literature on trust and trustworthiness. Much of
the recent research falls into three groups: studies
of the prisoner's dilemma or the two-person nonsum
zero game recently reviewed by Vinacke (1969);
studies of source credibility recently reviewed by
Giffin (1967); and studies involving the choice of
n smaller immediate reward versus a promised
larger delayed reward, reviewed by Mischel (1966).
Most of these investigations have dealt with condition differences or experimental manipulations and
not with individual differences. With some exceptions, when individual differences were studied, they
usually failed to find relationships between personality variables and trusting behavior, particularly
in the prisoner's dilemma paradigm. One exception, evidenced from such studies as those of
Deutsch (I960) and Wrightsman (1966), inclicatos that trust and trustworthiness are positively
associated.
The failure of individual differences measures of
stable personal characteristics in these studies can
be attributed either to the fact that trust is a
specific rather than a generalized characteristic,
that the personality measures were themselves invalid, or that the measures used were poorly
selected and perhaps irrelevant. However, a fourth
possibility is that the prisoner's dilemma and similar games produce a relatively specific reaction,
characteristic of competitive games but not of other
kinds of interpersonal interactions. In fact, if the
results of these studies were characteristic of everyday behavior, the normal adult is so competitive,

uncooperative, and untrusting that he could hardly
get through a normal day's activities.
Studies in which the experimental conditions are
manipulated as a sole focus of the investigation
have their limitations as well as their advantages.
One limitation is that there are a large number of
conditions that are worth studying but that cannot
easily be manipulated experimentally. Perhaps a
more serious limitation is that the parameters of
groups that are used in such studies are not themselves varied so that it is not known whether the
results could be generalized to other groups or,
indeed, what variables in group selection are relevant in generalizing results. The advantages of
conditions manipulations studies or so-called experimental studies are the ease of design and the
fact that when condition differences appear, they
may provide important leads not only for immediate application, but also for the origin or the
nature of the conditions that produce individual
differences.
Alternatively, the study of individual differences
may produce important hypotheses for studies of
conditions effects. Individual differences, particularly in social behavior, are largely the result of
earlier condition differences, and individual difference measures are of primary significance for investigations involving the development, origin,
maintenance, and stability of the behavior being
studied. Most efficacious is the interaction design
where conditions differences are combined with
relevant personal measures. The effect of various
kinds of experimental manipulations will vary as a
result of using different groups of subjects regardless of whether we are studying trust, aggression,
anxiety, cautiousness, dissonance reduction, or social attitudes. Only when we know whether or not
interaction effects are present, do we begin to approach a meaningful understanding of the behavior
we arc studying.
Our strategy, therefore, was to develop a theoretically based measure of interpersonal trust focused on college students, not only as our most
available subject population, but also because they
represent the future policy makers of our society.
Before going on to determine whether or not there
is generality to trusting behavior, how differences
in trust develop, and how individual differences in
trust interact with a variety of experimental conditions, it is necessary to discuss the meaning of a

<-----Page 2----->RXPKCTANCIKS I'OK I N T K K P I C K S O N A L TlUIST

generalized expectancy within the framework of
social learning theory.
In social learning theory, the potential of the
occurrence of a behavior is considered to be a
function of the expectancy that that behavior will
lead to a particular reinforcement or reinforcements, and the value of these reinforcements in a
given situation. Tn other words, there are four
classes of variables with which we deal—behavior
potentials, expectancies, reinforcement values, and
situations.
The relationship we have postulated among these
four variables allows for the prediction of a specific
behavior in a given situation. The process of generalization accounts for the consistency and stability of behavior across situations. In social learning
theory, an expectancy is a function of a specific
expectancy, and a generalized expectancy resulting
from the generalization from related experience.
The relative importance of the specific expectancy
is a function of the degree of experience in that
specific situation, or conversely, the importance of
generalized expectancy is a function of the degree
of novelty, ambiguity, or unstructuredness of a
particular situation. The more novel the situation,
the greater weight generalized expectancies have.
Because expectancies generalize along lines of perceived similarity, relatively stable modes of responding develop, and a learned basis for a theory
of personality is provided. A full statement of
this theory is provided elsewhere (Rotter, 1954;
Rotter, Chance, & Phares, 1971). What is important here, however, is that the theory itself provides
for general characteristics and also for specificity.
The situation partially determines the response, and
the theory predicts that situations of considerable
familiarity are less predictable from a generalized
tendency than those involving more novelty.
Whether or not one trusts his wife would give us
less information about whether the same person
would trust the butcher than if we knew whether
or not he trusted his automobile mechanic. Tf one
wanted to relate trust of marital partners to marital
adjustment, a test specifically designed to measure
such trust would be better than one that sampled
trust of butchers and automobile mechanics. The
difference between specific and generalized expectancy is relative and arbitrary, but the distinction
is of considerable significance for the development of certain kinds of personality measurement
instruments.

Early research in social learning was concerned
with psychological needs, that is, with the prediction of classes of behavior, functionally related in
that they led to the same or similar reinforcements.
In recent years, we have turned our attention to
another class of content variables or personality
variables which are referred to as generalized expectancies for problem solving. Man is a categorizing animal. He continuously forms concepts,
changes concepts, and discovers new dimensions of
similarity. Where similarity is perceived, the basis
for generalization and a functional personality concept is present. Psychological situations, both social
and nonsocial, may also be perceived as similar in
that they present similar problems. For example,
all of us are continuously faced with the problem
of deciding whether what happens to us is contingent on our own behavior and can be controlled
by our own actions or whether it depends upon
luck, the intervention of powerful others, or influences which we cannot understand. Some of you
will recognize that the general problem just described has been conceptualized as internal versus
external control of reinforcement (Rotter, 1966).
We have also done work with generalized expectancies for cautiousness, for guilt, and a generalized
expectancy that problems can be solved by the
technique of looking for alternatives (Rotter et al.,
1971). It is not the reinforcement which is similar
in the various situations in which the individual
finds himself, but it is some aspect of the situations
which presents a similar problem.
Another common human experience is that of
being provided with information from other people,
either promises of reinforcements to come, or
merely statements of presumed fact. Implicit in
all these situations is the problem of whether or
not to believe the other person. On this basis, we
have hypothesized a generalized expectancy of trust
or distrust.
Following these theoretical lines, we have constructed what I refer to as an additive test of
interpersonal trust. An additive test is one whose
purpose is to sample a broad range of situations
of more or less equivalent strength with the effectiveness of the instrument dependent upon the
adequacy of the sampling of situations. In contrast, a power test varies items in strength and
samples from a narrow or restricted range of events.
Achievement tests are typical power tests. Additive
tests have some characteristics that should be noted,

<-----Page 3----->446

AMKKICAN PSYCHOLOGIST

In general, they may be expected to provide lower
prediction in any specific situation than a power
test devised to measure in that situation, hut be
able to predict to a greater range of situations.
They may also be expected not to predict at all in
some situations in which the subjects have had a
great deal of consistent experience. Internal consistency of additive tests would be expected to be
lower than that of power tests.
The test construction procedure followed was to
devise a large number of items presented in a
Likert format which appeared to deal with belief
in the communications of others. The others dealt
with were not specific persons with whom the individual had had a long time close association, but
rather classes of significant others whose behavior
could affect the subject's life. Consequently, items
dealt with such social agents as teachers, other
students, judges, newspaper writers, politicians, etc.
Following administration of these items to a large
number of male and female college students, items
were retained or rejected on the basis of three
criteria. The first of these was a significant correlation with the total of all the other items with
that item removed, the second was that the item
produced a spread of scores providing maximum
differentiation of subjects, and the last was that
the item did not correlate too highly with the
Marlowc-Crowne Social Desirability scale (Crowne
& Marlowe, 1964).
We did not attempt to eliminate all relationship
to social desirability because we felt that theoretically the motive for social approval was not entirely
unrelated to trust of others.
The final form of the test included 25 trust items
and 1 5 filler items. The scale has an internal consistency of .76, and retest reliabilities for five weeks,
three months, and seven months were, respectively,
.69, .68, and .56. For males and females combined,
the test correlates .29 with the Marlowe-Crownc
Social Desirability scale which suggests that trust
is regarded as a socially desirable trait, but that
the total amount of variance in the test scale accounted for by the social approval motive is relatively small. If is clear that the expression of
distrust in many situations is not followed by
social disapproval. There is no significant correlation with college entrance scores. Contrary to
the belief of many, high intelligence does not necessarily lead to distrust. Alienation, in the sense of
powerlessness, as measured by the .Internal-External

Control scale is significantly related to scores on
the trust scale. Since both scales arc questionnaires, method variance could account for the correlation. But the relationship remains significant
and in the thirties in four large samples when social
desirability is partialed out. In any case, it is
logical that those who distrust would feel less
ability to control and that those who felt that they
could not control what happened to them would be
somewhat lower in trust.
Some demographic data are available on the
scale. Two studies indicate that youngest children
are less trusting than only, oldest, or middle children (Geller, 1966; Rotter, 1967). College students reporting themselves as agnostics and atheists
are significantly less trusting than others. Students
who perceive their parents as believing in two
different religious are less trusting than those who
perceive both parents as believing in the same
religion or lack of religion. Differences among
religious affiliations arc present, but they appear
to reflect socioeconomic differences in our population. Tn any case, at the University of Connecticut,
Jewish students were found to be more trusting,
followed by Protestants, and Catholics being least
trusting. Socioeconomic level of parents shows a
small but consistent decrease in trust with decreasing socioeconomic levels. Since large numbers of
subjects were used in the study of demographic
characteristics, relatively small differences were
significant, and overlap among groups was very
great.
Tn order to assess the construct validity of this
scale, a first study was conducted (Rotter, 1967)
using a sociomctric method in college fraternities
and sororities. Two sororities and two fraternities
were used, and all members of these organizations
who had lived together for a period of at least
six months were included in this study. In addition to asking subjects to nominate members of
the group who were highest and lowest in interpersonal trust, three other variables were included
that might be related to trust—gullibility, dependency, and trustworthiness. As control variables,
humor, popularity, and friendship were included.
The results of this study indicate that the scale
could significantly predict sociometric ratings of
trust and that these predictions were significantly
higher than the control variables of popularity,
friendship, and humor, hi other words, discriminant as well as construct validity was demonstrated.

<-----Page 4----->EXPECTANCIES TOR TNTERVKRSONAL TRUST
Interestingly enough, gullibility and dependency
were negatively related to trust, both as measured
by the. trust scale and sociometric trust. The high
truster does not trust out of a need to have someone else take care of him, and apparently he is not
regarded as someone who is easily fooled, tricked,
or is naive. On the other hand, as demonstrated
in previous studies, trustworthiness is closely related
both to sociometric trust and to the interpersonal
trust scale (see Rotter, 1967).
An unpublished dissertation by Geller (1966)
assessed the validity of the scale under experimental
conditions with a behavioral criterion. The study
by Geller and some of the others referred to involved deception. .It seems paradoxical that an
interest in interpersonal trust would lead to deception experiments, and we have avoided them
wherever possible. However, for some problems it
is extremely difficult to study trust in the laboratory without some mild deception. In Geller's
study, trust scale scores were collected in the
elementary psychology course on the first day of
classes, and the experiment that took place from
two to four months later was not connected in any
way by the subjects with the test administration
earlier. A similar procedure was used in the other
studies referred to later in this article.
Geller (1966) had three groups of subjects. The
first group volunteered for a study of auditory discrimination. They were brought into the laboratory and went through the Crutchfield variation
of the Asch conformity experiment. They were
then asked to fill out a brief form, and while they
were doing so, a student confederate told them
that they had just been tricked and that there
were, in fact, no other subjects in other booths
and that the whole thing was done by the use of
a tape recorder. Following this, they were taken
to another room where the second part of the
experiment began. The second group was similar
to the first except that the confederate only made
some small talk and did not reveal that the Asch
situation was a hoax. The third group was not
placed in the Asch situation at all, but brought
immediately to the second part of the experiment.
In the second phase of this experiment, subjects
were asked to discriminate two chords played on
a tape recorder as to whether they were the same
or different. The chords had been pretested and
were easily identified by 100% of the pretest subjects. Subjects were told that we were interested

447

in how quickly they could make the discrimination
and were shown a simple apparatus with two brass
knobs, one of them labeled "Same," and one,
"Different."
The experimenter demonstrated,
"When the two chords were the same, you pull out
one knob; when they were different, you pull out
the other." As he pulled out the knob for
"Different," a big blue spark leaped out from the
apparatus making a loud noise. The experimenter
jumped up and down, swore, and finally said, "1
thought they had fixed that." He then retreated
behind the apparatus, stayed there 10 seconds,
came out and assured the subject that it was now
fixed and that he would not get a shock.
Following the behavioral criterion situation, subjects were taken to another room and interviewed
about their feelings about the experiment using a
structured open-ended interview. Judges rated
responses to determine whether or not they trusted
the experimenter when he said that the apparatus
was fixed. Blind ratings by judges who did not
know which group the subject was in were used.
In the behavioral criterion situation, the first
four chords on the tape were all different, and it
was possible to measure how long it took the subject before he pulled out the knob, whether he
pulled it out at all, and other spontaneous comments and behavioral indications that he did not
trust the experimenter's reassurance. Judges behind a one-way screen rated behavior without
knowing a subject's group membership. Geller
(1966) hypothesized that the group that had been
told they had been tricked earlier would show the
greatest distrust in this situation, the control group
the least, and those who had gone through the Asch
situation and who had been told nothing would be
in the middle. In general, these results were obtained, and they are best illustrated by the correlations of the trust scale with trusting behavior
in the behavioral situation and in the interview
that followed.
In the behavioral criterion situation, the trust
scale correlated with trusting behavior significantly
only in the control group. The correlation of .38
was about the same as that obtained in the sociometric study. In the deception-concealed situation,
the correlation fell to .14, and in the deception
revealed, to —.04. Apparently subjects who have
been told that they have been tricked, even though
trusting to begin with, will not trust further. These
findings support the sociometric study which indi-

<-----Page 5----->448

catcs that, gullibility and trust are two different
variables. It also suggests (hat the Asch situation
in itself produces more suspicion than many
experimenters seem to be aware of.
One of the most interesting findings from this
study is that in the interview situation a significant correlation of .43 appeared between the trust
scale and admission that the subject was suspicious
of the experimenter only in the group that had
had the deception revealed. That is, in this group,
high trtisters said that they were suspicious and
low Irustcrs said they were not. Analysis of the
behavior of this group indicated that on the behavioral criterion, most subjects, both high and low
truslers, were suspicious. The high trustcrs told
the truth and admitted it, the low trusters denied
it. The point is of considerable significance for
deception studies that rely on interviews to demonstrate the success of a deception. What these
results indicate is that low trusters, the people
who might be expected to be most suspicious, are
the ones who will deny suspicion. While these
results may not be generalizable to all deception studies, they are true for this study under
conditions where the subject has good reason
to feel that he has already been tricked by the
experimenter.
The study by Roberts (1967) deals with the
same topic. In Roberts' research, the subjects were
given some experimenter tips on how to use their
time most effectively in preparing for a reading
comprehension test. Both high and low trusters,
who were given correct tips, made increased
use of the suggestions over three trials. For subjects, however, who were given incorrect tips, the
low trusters quickly abandoned the experimenter's
advice, but the high trusters persisted in following
it over the three trials of the experiment. The
high trusters showed a gradual decline, the low
trusters, a precipitous one. The results appear
contradictory to the previous study which indicated high trusters were not gullible. The difference between the two studies, however, was that
in Roberts' study, after having given the wrong
advice, the experimenter admitted it was the wrong
advice, apologized, and said the next time he would
do better. High trusters, in other words, will
permit a mistake or two and still trust providing
the mistake is admitted and an apology made. If
they are shown clear-cut evidence that they have
been tricked, they will continue to extend trust.

The point may be of significance for government
and other institutions that have lost credibility
with the public and hope to regain it.
Other studies illustrate the breadth or range
and limitations of behavioral prediction possible
from this scale. Gilbert (1967) studied subjects'
willingness to disclose personal and uncomplimentary information about themselves and found such
willingness significantly related to their trust scores.
MacDonald, Kessel, and Fuller ( 1 9 7 0 ) , however,
failed to obtain any relationship between willingness for self-disclosure using the Jourard Scale and
interpersonal trust scores; nor did they find a correlation between interpersonal trust scores and a
modified prisoner's dilemma game. As they point
out, however, their game did not require believing
or not believing someone else, but rather dealt
with belief in the benevolence or malevolence of
the other person. At least in this game situation,
the two arc not related. Similarly, in two studies
involving sensitivity groups (Aronson, 1970; Stein,
1970), the interpersonal trust scale did not relate
to judges' ratings of subjects' openness in this
situation. The kind of trust we are measuring, it
appears, is what we set out to measure, an expectancy that communications can be believed, not a
willingness or desire to speak about private matters
to strangers or belief in the benevolence of others
in competitive situations. Hamsher (1968) also
failed to find a statistically significant relationship,
although a trend was present, between interpersonal
trust scores and trusting behavior in a competitive
stock market game where communications were
exchanged and the subjects had the choice of lying
or telling the truth. He did, however, find a statistically significant relationship between interpersonal trust scores and trustworthiness in the
game. In other words, although high trusters in
this game showed only a trend toward believing
communications of competitors more than low
trusters, they found it more difficult to lie than
did low trusters.
Hamsher, Geller, and Rotter (1968) related trust
scale scores given at the beginning of the semester,
as in the other studies reported, to a survey on
belief in the Warren Commission Report given
one month later. A strong relationship between
trust scale scores and the belief that the Warren
Commission knew there was a conspiracy and was
covering it up was present. .Eighty-five percent

<-----Page 6----->EXPECTANCIES FOR INTEKPJJKSONAL TRUST
of the subjects said that they had followed the
controversy closely.
An interesting sidelight of this study was that
the responses to the question "T believe that there
was, in fact, a conspiracy and information about
it has been kept from the public" was responded
to positively by 28% of the subjects; 19% said,
"I don't know"; and only 52% said, "No."
These figures are not much different from those
of public opinion polls reported in the newspapers
which asked a similar question. That 28% of
the public could unequivocally believe that a committee which had been formed with the purpose
of placing on it those people who were most
believable and respected in our country could feel
that these people were deliberately lying to them
is indeed shocking.
In a study whose primary focus was investigation
of sex guilt, Boroto (1970) obtained an interesting incidental finding regarding the trust scale.
Boroto's subjects were brought into a room where
he presumably had some personal information about
them in a folder and where he also accidentally
knocked over a folder containing "filthy pictures"
on his way out of the office to answer a telephone
call. Scooping up the pictures and replacing them
in the folder, he left the office where the subjects
were being observed surreptitiously. When Boroto
divided his subjects into those who looked into the
folder involving their personal information, or the
dirty pictures, or both, and compared them with
those subjects who did not invade the experimenter's privacy, he found considerable difference
in the mean trust scores. Those who looked at
neither folder had a mean interpersonal trust score
of 80, and those who looked at either of the folders
averaged a score of 66. The difference is not only
highly statistically significant, but is approximately
one and a half standard deviations different. The
average score for those who looked at either folder
was close to the mean of the larger population. It
was those who did not look at either folder who
were deviant in being unusually high on trust.
Interestingly enough, in a later interview, about
half of the subjects who had looked at the folders
denied looking at them.
Two studies have investigated the antecedents of
interpersonal trust in college students. Katz and
Rotter (1969) sent the parents of 100 students,
who were one-half of a standard deviation above
and 100 students who were one one-half of a stan-

449

dard deviation below the mean of a larger group,
trust scales using a strong appeal and received
67% returns. The students themselves had taken
the scale approximately one year earlier. The
letters were sent so that they would arrive on
Monday, and it was requested that they be returned by Friday. They were sent only to parents
of students who lived some distance from campus
so that the potential of contamination from the
students themselves was minimal. The results indicated no differential return rate from the parents
of high trusters or low trusters. The fathers of
high-trusting sons were significantly higher on
trust than the fathers of low-trusting sons. The
fathers did not appear to have a significant effect
on daughters, and mothers' scores showed a weak
statistical trend toward a small and equal effect on
sons and (laughters. The important role the father
appears to have in influencing the trust of sons we
have interpreted as due to the fact that it is the
father who interprets the trustworthiness of outside agents to the family. His major concern is in
educating his son who must, like him eventually
make his way in a world where he is continuously
dealing with strangers.
A study by Into (1969) investigated a large
number of child-raising behaviors by interviewing
college students and obtaining their statements
about their parents' behavior during childhood.
While such studies have their obvious limitations,
they can be the source of valuable hypotheses, and
they do provide some suggestive evidence. A large
number of variables were investigated, and the results are too extensive to be reviewed here. What
is clear is that the strongest effects were modeling
effects, both of the father and the mother, and
direct teaching effects. The parents of high trusting subjects were more trusting to their children,
were more trustworthy, trusted outsiders more, and
directly taught trust and trustworthiness. Although
these effects were significant for both fathers and
mothers, they were again a little stronger for
fathers. One finding of interest in relationship to
the earlier reported differentiation of trust as an
expectancy for truthfulness versus trust in the
belief in a benign world, was that low trusters were
likely to report that their parents made no threats
or made them and did not keep them, and high
trusters were likely to report that their parents
both made and kept threats.

AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST

Hochreich (1066) has developed a cartoon type
test to study trust in children. The test differentiates children who select, an immediate lesser reward
from a larger promised delayed reward at less than
the .10 level of significance in the expected direction. Too little data on this instrument, however,
are available to assess its validity.
While discussing developmental antecedents of
low trust, mention should be made of the relationship of trust to adjustment. Four independent
samples of subjects from various experiments provided scores on the Incomplete Sentences Blank
(Rotter & Rafferty, 1950), a measure of college
student adjustment; and the Interpersonal Trust
Scale (Gcllcr, 1966; Hochreich, 1968; Mulry,
1966; Rotter & Stein, 1970). It seems to be
clearly established that low trust correlates with
maladjustment as measured by the Incomplete
Sentences Blank. The correlation is low but significant in all samples when sexes arc combined.
Most samples show a higher relationship for females, but whether or not the difference between
males and females is characteristic of the total
student population is still unclear. In some samples
where it is possible to partial out the effects of
social desirability, the significant relationship between adjustment and trust remains. Of course,
it cannot be determined from this data whether low
trust leads to adjustment problems or adjustment
problems lead to low trust, or whether, in fact,
both are the effects of developmental experiences.
With Donald Stein, T have also been studying
public attitudes of trust toward various occupational groups (Rotter & Stein, 1970). We have set
up separate rating scales for trust, competence,
and altruism. We have obtained four samples of
subjects—200 elementary psychology students from
the University of Connecticut, 100 from the University of Maryland, 50 secretaries in a public
school system, and 50 high school teachers. Most
of the secretaries had only a high school education
plus some business training and had an average
age of 38. The 50 teachers all had bachelor's or
master's degrees and had an average age of 35.
The results of this study are still being analyzed,
but. some preliminary results are of interest.
Surprisingly, the mean ratings given to the 20
occupations correlated, from one sample to another,
in the nineties for all variables and groups. That
is, the attitudes of the teachers, male and female
college students of two different universities, and

secretaries—populations which varied in age, sex,
education, and geography-—were all surprisingly and
highly similar. The average rating, by the subjects,
of the truthfulness of the 20 occupations, also
correlated significantly with their trust scales. This
suggests that the studies done about attitudes of
college students would not be too dissimilar from
those of the more general population which might
be called white collar or middle class. The second
finding of interest is that although these scales
intcrcorrelated, when all the samples arc combined,
the correlation between trust and competence is .60;
between trust and altruism, .63; and between
competence and altruism, .55. There was still a
considerable independent variance. If the correlations between the means of the different samples
can be taken as an estimate of reliability, it is
clear that the three scales are measuring at least
partially independent variables.
Time permits only a brief description of some
of the interesting findings regarding specific occupations. Of particular interest is the discrepancy
between rankings on the different scales for some
of the occupations. For example, clergymen who
ranked first on altruism, ranked only eighth on
competence. Dentists, on the other hand, ranked
second on competence but sixth on altruism.
Psychiatrists and psychologists ranked higher on
altruism than they did on competence and truthfulness. Surprisingly, law enforcement officials were
rated as ranking ninth on altruism, tenth on truthfulness, but sixteenth on competence. Executives
of large corporations ranked ninth on competence,
fourteenth on truthfulness, and eighteenth on altruism. The anchor occupation which ranked lowest
on all three scales was used car salesman, and
physicians are seen as highest in competence and
truthfulness.
The psychologists' rating on truthfulness was
seventh, better than the average but not really
anything to brag about. It should be a matter of
concern to psychologists who desire to make contributions to our society that this rating does not
become any lower and, hopefully, will become
higher. Continuation of large numbers of deception experiments and the public announcement of
opinions as substitutes Cor replicable data obviously
will not help it.
Finally, the question of whether or not trust in
significant others in this society is indeed dropping

<-----Page 8----->EXPECTANCIES FOR INTERPERSONAL TUTJST
during recent years should be considered. Since
1964, my assistants and I have tested the elementary psychology students under comparable testing
conditions every fall semester, and in some years
also in the spring semester. Analyses have indicated that the samples have not changed significantly in class rank, in college entrance examination scores, or ethnic composition. In all, 4,605
students were included in the six-year study, and
each of the individual samples is large. The results
are somewhat startling in that each year there was
a significant drop in mean trust scores comparing
the September testing with the prior September
testing. These results are in agreement with a
recent report of Wrightsman and Baker (1969)
who gave a Philosophies of Human Nature Scale to
incoming freshmen at Peabody University on several occasions over the period 1954-1968. A subscale of this test dealing with trust showed a significant decline over the period. Trust was defined
by them as "the extent to which people are seen
as moral, honest or reliable [p. 2991."
In the 1964 study, the average score was 72.4;
in 1969, it was 66.6 (Hochreich & Rotter, 1970).
The difference is not only highly statistically significant, but it indicates that a student who was at
the mean of the distribution in 1969 would have
been in the lower one-third of the distribution in
1964. That such a drop is not the result of it
becoming less socially desirable to express trust,
is attested to by the fact that correlations with
the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability scale and
the trust scale did not differ significantly over the
period studied.
An item analysis was made to discover how general was the drop in trust and in what items was
it greatest. In all, 14 items dropped significantly,
and 1 increased significantly from 1964 to 1969.
The items that showed the greatest decrease included those in the areas of politics, peace keeping,
and communications. The items that showed little
or no change included mainly those dealing with
social agents with whom the subjects were likely
to have had some direct contact, such as parents,
repairmen, salesmen, ordinary people. The decline
in trust over the last six years may not be surprising to many, but it appears to the author to
indeed be precipitous, and should it continue, our
society would be in serious trouble, if it is not
so already.
