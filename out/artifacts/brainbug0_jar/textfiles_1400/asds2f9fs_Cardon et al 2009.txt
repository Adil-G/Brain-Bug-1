Abstract
In this paper we examine the relationship between the passion an entrepreneur displays, the
passion angels perceive, and the impact on angels’ interest and funding of ventures. Our qualitative study results indicate that angels do use displayed passion as a factor in their investment
decisions and specifically focus on the enthusiasm, preparedness, and commitment entrepreneurs
demonstrate. Results from our quantitative study suggest that the importance of different types of
displayed passion varies depending on the stage of the funding process examined, and that all three
types of displayed passion have a relationship with perceived passion and evaluations of funding
potential, although the nature of these relationships is complex.

ABSTRACT
In this paper we examine the relationship between the passion an entrepreneur displays, the
passion angels perceive, and the impact on angels’ interest and funding of ventures. Our
qualitative study results indicate that angels do use displayed passion as a factor in their
investment decisions and specifically focus on the enthusiasm, preparedness, and commitment
entrepreneurs demonstrate. Results from our quantitative study suggest that the importance of
different types of displayed passion varies depending on the stage of the funding process
examined, and that all three types of displayed passion have a relationship with perceived passion
and evaluations of funding potential, although the nature of these relationships is complex.
INTRODUCTION
Entrepreneurs need financial resources to grow their ventures, and often such resources come
from outside investors, such as venture capitalists, angel investors, or friends and family.
Entrepreneurs of fast growth firms who anticipate quick and aggressive growth often turn to angel
investors for financing. Angels, who are often wealthy individuals with experience building a
business, provide early stage financing for start-up ventures. Angel investors have provided seed
capital for notable U.S. businesses such as Bell Telephone in 1874, Ford Motor Company in 1903,
and Apple Computer in 1977 (e.g., Van Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). Although it is hard to
estimate the exact size of angel investment due to its highly fragmented nature, in 2007 it is
estimated that angels invested a total of $26 billion in 57,120 entrepreneurs (e.g., Sohl, 2008.).
Angels tend to invest in very early stages of the funding process, before new ventures typically
can attract venture capital financing. Therefore, angel capital plays an important role in the
entrepreneurial process.
Prior research suggests that angels use various criteria for determining whether or not to invest
in a start-up, including enthusiasm of the entrepreneur, trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, exit
route, revenue potential, domain expertise of the entrepreneur, growth potential of the market, and
barriers for entry (eg. Van Osnabrugge, 1998, Sudek, 2006). One investment criteria receiving
increasing attention is entrepreneurial passion. Chen, Yao, and Kotha (2009) argue that “passion
is often critical to convince the targeted individuals to invest their money, time, and effort in the
new venture.” Passion may provide a strong indication of how committed the entrepreneur is to
putting in the time and effort needed to make the company a success (c.f. Vallerand, et al., 2003).
Passion may be associated with drive, tenacity, initiative, and willingness to work long hours
(Bierly et al., 2000; Bird, 1989), and may help entrepreneurs find creative solutions to problems,
persist despite obstacles, and experience a flow-like state of absorption (Cardon et al., 2009).
While scholars have recently focused on passion as experienced by entrepreneurs (e.g.
Klauken, Paetzelt, & Shepherd, 2008; Cardon et al, 2009), others suggest that displayed passion is
perhaps just as important (e.g. Cardon, 2008). This is because some people display emotions they

do not feel (e.g. Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987; Dasborough & Ashkanasy, 2002), and some are less
expressive in displaying felt emotions (e.g., Kring, Smith, & Neale, 1994). We use the term
“displayed passion” to refer to the emotion that is expressed or displayed by the entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurs may be more persuasive when they demonstrate high levels of positive emotion
(Baron, 2008), may appear more confident, and may receive more favorable decisions from
investors (Chen, et al., 2009).
When entrepreneurs display passion, such as through providing animated venture pitches or
presentations, potential investors make assessments concerning the level of perceived passion, or
the amount of passion they perceive the entrepreneur to have. This is distinct from displayed
passion, because the emotion an entrepreneur is trying to communicate through their display may
not be perceived by the investor, or the investor may perceive that the displayed emotion is not
genuine and thus will not perceive the entrepreneur to have passion. We use the term “perceived
passion” to refer to the extent to which others perceive the entrepreneur to be passionate about
their venture.
Scholars suggest that both angels and VCs rate perceived passion as an important investment
criterion (e.g., MacMillan et al., 1987; Carter & Van Auken, 1992), however angels may view
perceived passion as even more important than VCs (Carter & Van Auken, 1992; Sudek, 2006;
Van Osnabrugge, 1998) due to their investments typically occurring at earlier stages of a
company’s life. It may also be more relevant to angel investors because they base a lot of stheir
investment decision on the entrepreneur themselves (Sudek, 2006), in addition to the business
opportunity.
Very little is known about the extent to which either displayed and/or perceived passion plays a
role in angel investment decisions. Thus, the focus of this study is on the relationship between an
entrepreneur’s displayed passion, the angels’ perceived passion and how far the entrepreneur gets
through the angel investment process. Angels have many decision points in considering investing
in a business and firms fall out of the process due to unfavorable decisions at each step. For
example, in our dataset, of the 1266 entrepreneurs who applied to the angel investor organization
at the time of our study, 152 were invited to make presentations, and to date only 30 have been
funded by angels in this group. While there may be several reasons why angels decide not to fund
a venture or to move it to the next stage in the funding process, we focus on the extent to which
displayed and perceived passion play a role in these decisions. Our specific research questions
are; 1) Do angel investors consider the passion of the entrepreneur when making their funding
decisions? If so, how do they conceive of passion? How do they evaluate it?; and 2) What impact
does passion have on the actual investment? How far can passion take an entrepreneur towards
acquiring the financial resources s/he wants from angels?
ANGEL INVESTING
Investors make their decisions to invest in startups based on the attributes of the entrepreneur,
the management team, and the business opportunity. Previous research has looked at VC and the
angel investment decisions (e.g., Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984; MacMillan, Siegel, & Subbanarasimha,
1985; MacMillan, Zemann, & Subbanarasimha, 1987; Carter and Van Auken, 1992; Van
Osnabrugge, 1998; Haar, Starr, and Macmillan, 1988; Sudek, 2006). These studies show that
entrepreneurial commitment, passion, trustworthiness, domain expertise, and track record are the
most important entrepreneurial characteristics. In addition, these studies showed that revenue
potential, market growth potential, barriers for entry, and exit potential are the most important
criteria when evaluating characteristics of the opportunity.

The funding decision process used by VCs and angels typically consists of an initial screening
of the opportunity, a screening presentation, due diligence, funding, and post investment
involvement (e.g., Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984; Sudek, 2006). The initial screening phase typically
filters out business opportunities that do not fit the VC or angel group. This may consist of a brief
meeting with the entrepreneur, or this might be done via business plan or application review by the
angel group. The screening phase consists of a presentation by the entrepreneur, followed by a
question and answer period. This phase typically lasts between 30 and 45 minutes. If there is
enough interest from the screening, the deal proceeds to due diligence. The due diligence phase
consists of multiple meetings with entrepreneur and investors to review the business plan in detail.
If it is determined the deal is still worthy of investing, a funding phase includes the final deal
terms negotiation and actual investment. After the investment is made both VC and angels are
involved with the company in the post investment phase.
Although entrepreneurs go through a similar funding decision process with both angels and
VCs (Sudek, 2006), angels differ from VCs in several important areas. Angels tend to invest in
very early stages of the funding process, before new ventures can attract venture capital financing
(Freear & Wetzel, 1990). Angel investors typically include private individuals that invest their
own money, whereas VCs invest funds raised from institutional investors (Van Osnabrugge,
2000). Angels perform less due diligence than VCs and invest more opportunistically, rely more
on instincts, and do not calculate internal rates of return (IRR) (e.g., Timmons, 1990; Baty, 1991;
Mason & Harrison, 1996; Van Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). Angels and VCs also differ in
their entrepreneurial experience and expected involvement (e.g., Van Osnabrugge & Robinson,
2000). In general, Angel investors have more operating experience and are much more involved
with the companies in which they invest than VCs. In addition, angels are more often involved in
day-to-day operations (e.g., Benjamin & Margulis, 2000). Often, Angels will work part-time with
periods of full-time commitment to help entrepreneurs through challenging issues (e.g., Van
Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000). For these reasons, the angel investment often becomes more
personal for the investor., and is distinct from VC investment. Because of these differences we
seek to understand how entrepreneurial passion may play a role in the funding decisions of angel
investors, a question not yet addressed in the literature.
ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION, DISPLAYED PASSION AND PERCEIVED PASSION
Entrepreneurial passion involves an “intense affective state that bears cognitive and behavioral
manifestations of high personal value” (Chen, Yao, & Kotha, 2009: 199). It involves intense and
positive feelings that entrepreneurs experience when they are engaged in key activities associated
with roles (such as founder) that are critical to the self-identity of the entrepreneur (Cardon et al.,
2009; Hoang & Gimeno, in press). The two key aspects of entrepreneurial passion seem to be that
1) it involves positive and intense feelings, and 2) the object of these feelings is profoundly
personally meaningful to the entrepreneur. It can be difficult for outsiders to determine the
personal meaning of activities or events to an entrepreneur, so the observable aspect of passion is
the intensity of the positive feelings that an entrepreneur displays.
While entrepreneurs can certainly display authentic emotions to others such as employees (e.g.
Cardon, 2008) or potential investors (Chen, et al., 2009), scholars determined long ago that
individuals can use emotional labor to display emotions they do not feel or hide emotions they do
feel in order to secure more positive outcomes for themselves (Rafaeli and Sutton, 1987) or their
organizations (Dashborough and Ashkanasy, 2002). The entire field of emotional intelligence is
based on the idea that individuals can control their own emotions, pick up on the emotions of
others, and deliberately try to influence the emotions of other people (Cross and Travaglione,

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2009

<-----Page 5----->Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 2, Art. 1

2003). Thus it is critical for us to differentiate between the passion or more general positive affect
experienced by entrepreneurs that other scholars have looked at (Cardon et al., 2009; Baum,
Locke, and Smith, 2001; Baron, 2008), the passion entrepreneurs choose to display, and passion as
perceived by others such as angel investors.
The passion an entrepreneur displays is important because it can lead investors to be more
confident in the entrepreneur, particularly when the product or environment is ambiguous and
uncertain (Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001). High levels of displayed positive affect can help
entrepreneurs expand their social networks and be more persuasive, which combined can increase
their social and financial capital (Baron, 2008). Displayed passion can also lead to emotional
contagion, where others cannot help but get caught up in the excitement the entrepreneur displays
(Cardon, 2008). This would lead to a suggestion that displayed passion, especially enthusiasm
which is most readily associated with the theoretical definition of passion as an affect, will lead to
greater investment by angels. More formally,
H1: Greater enthusiasm (displayed affective passion) will be associated with greater
evaluations of funding potential.
In addition, different aspects of how an entrepreneur displays passion might be important,
including affective, cognitive, and behavioral aspects. Chen, Yao, and Kotha (2009) define
passion as an intense affective state that is accompanied by cognitive and behavioral
manifestations of high personal value. They talk about affective passion, which when displayed is
akin to enthusiasm, and suggest that the affective experience of passion tends to be accompanied
by cognitive arousal (I can’t stop thinking about my business) and behaviors to act on that passion
(Chen et al., 2009). In particular they argue that in addition to enthusiasm, investors will pay
attention to the cognitive preparedness of an entrepreneur that is likely associated with passion.
We agree that investors may well consider how prepared an entrepreneur is for a presentation and
assess how much thinking they have done about their business; their preparedness. In fact, Chen,
Yao, and Kotha (2009) found that for student business plan presentations, business plan judges
(i.e. bankers, VCs, and individuals from financial companies) paid more attention to preparedness
than to the displayed enthusiasm of student presenters. The content of the business plan itself was
more important than the manner in which the pitch was delivered. Consistent with their findings
and the theoretical arguments above, we propose that,
H2: Greater preparedness (displayed cognitive passion) will be associated with greater
evaluations of funding potential.
Investors may also consider how committed an entrepreneur is to the business in terms of their
behaviors. The entrepreneur’s commitment and determination are critical when looking for
successful entrepreneurs (e.g., Timmons & Spinelli 2004). As Benjamin and Margulis (2000: 95)
articulated, investors pay great attention to passionately committed entrepreneurs. For example,
whether or not the entrepreneur has committed their own money to the venture may be important,
as well as whether the entrepreneur still maintains another job or only works for the company
seeking investment. These behavioral manifestations may be associated with the amount of
passion an entrepreneur experiences, and therefore are a part of the passion they may display to
others. From an investment perspective, when an entrepreneur has invested their own money
angels feel they have “skin in the game.” This signals to the angels that they are more committed
to a successful outcome. Sudek (2006) reported that in a qualitative study of angel investors
discussed an entrepreneur who appeared passionate and committed based on investing his own
money, one who showed high energy and enthusiasm that impressed the angels. In addition, the

<-----Page 6----->Cardon et al.: IMPACT OF PERCEIVED ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION

passionate entrepreneur had made reasonable money in past careers and had put up most of his
money, including mortgaging his house, to start the company. The passion and perceived
commitment of this entrepreneur garnered excitement from the investors.
H3: Greater commitment (displayed behavioral passion) will be associated with greater
evaluations of funding potential.
However, if the passion displayed is perceived by angels as momentary or not genuine, it will
likely not have a major impact on angel investing. Angel investors typically screen many
companies and have developed a sense of when the presenter is genuinely passionate about their
product or company and when not. Similarly, Elsbach and Kramer (2003) found that when
unknown screenwriters pitched ideas for shows to studio producers, the producers categorized the
presenters based on their level of passion in order to assess their creative potential, including the
ability to adapt and innovate, versus presenters that had an interesting story but lacked this creative
potential. This categorization determined whether or not the script would be successful at that
studio. We believe angel investors have a similar skill at reading between the lines to determine
their own assessment of the perceived passion of the entrepreneur. They may also rely more on
their assessment of the sincerity of the entrepreneur’s displayed passion (Chen, Yao, and Kotha,
2009; Ferris, Treadway, Perrewe, Brouer, Douglas, & Lux, 2007) in making their funding
decisions.
In addition, temporary emotions, such as those elicited through contagion processes, tend to
diminish once the stimuli (such as the immediate presence of the passionate entrepreneur) is
removed (Bechara, Dimasio, and Dimasio, 2003). This leads us to believe that some aspects of
displayed passion, such as preparedness and commitment, may be more important than displayed
enthusiasm at later stages of the funding process. Overall, we suggest that while all three aspects
of displayed passion will influence the extent of progress an entrepreneur makes in the funding
process, a key mediating variable may be the level of perceived passion on the part of the angel
investor.
H4: The relationship between a) enthusiasm, b) preparedness, and c) commitment and
greater evaluations of funding potential will be mediated by the level of passion perceived
by angel investors.
METHODS
To test our hypotheses we conducted two studies, one qualitative and one quantitative. In the
first we qualitatively assessed our first research question, how angel investors think about passion
and whether they think it is relevant to the investment decision. In the second study we examined
our second research question, the impact of the perceived passion of entrepreneurs on the funding
process, and tested our hypotheses using a sample of 60 entrepreneurs and 53 angels.
Study 1
In study 1, data were gathered from multiple US angel investment groups to determine what
angel investors think about perceived entrepreneurial passion. These groups sometimes invest as a
group, but typically each angel decides whether or not to independently invest. In the fall of
2008, angels were asked to take an online survey that included measures of 1) the extent to which
they include perceived passion as a criterion when they make investment decisions; 2) why

Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research 2009

<-----Page 7----->Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 2, Art. 1

passion is or isn’t important when evaluating an entrepreneur; 3) how they define perceived
passion; and 4) the specific behaviors or attitudes they look for in entrepreneurs seeking funding.
This qualitative study was necessary to validate and modify the scale that has been used in
prior research to assess perceived passion (Chen et al., 2009), for several reasons. First, the prior
scale was developed to assess passion in student presentations, which might be quite different than
presentations given by practicing entrepreneurs. Second, the prior scale was used by judges (i.e.
bankers, VCs, and individuals from financial companies) to assess student presentations, and
research has shown that angel investing is quite different than VC investing (e.g., Van Osnabrugge
& Robinson, 2000), and may also differ from typical loan decisions from banks. For example,
because angels do not have to answer to other partners in a firm they may have less rigorous and
objective evaluations of ventures (e.g., Van Osnabrugge & Robinson, 2000), and are thus perhaps
more easily persuaded by a passionate entrepreneur. Finally, the scale developed by Chen and
colleagues has only been used in one prior study, and therefore validation of the scale in other
contexts is important.
Study 1 results. 1,336 angels were asked to participate in this study, and 150 angels completed
the survey, yielding a response rate of 11%. The average rating of how important passion is to
their investment decisions was 4.53 on a 5 point scale. Definitions of passion included comments
such as “passion is the emotional attachment to the business that carries you through the hard
times. It is often the intense, driving feeling or conviction that this can work, will work, and must
work.”
In response to the question of why passion is important, angels responded with comments such
as “it reflects the entrepreneur’s level of commitment to and energy for the endeavor being
considered.” “Without passion it won’t last long.” “Without passion, the normal speed bumps can
be terminal.” “Passion keeps people going in the face of obstacles and early failures.” “It
contributes to momentum and has an infectious quality that brings in talent and money.”
However, other angels were more skeptical of using passion as an investment criterion, making
comments such as the following: “No amount of passion can make a pig fly.” “Passion is
important, but more of a necessary than sufficient condition for considering an investment.”
“Numbers speak for themselves and the idea should make sense on its own. No one person can
sell an idea just with passion.” “Too much passion is dangerous because it equates to tunnel
vision.” “Passion is just one part of the equation: skill, knowledge, intelligence, eloquence, etc.”
also matter. “it is just one element of the recipe. For example, it would never be more important
to me than intelligence but intelligence is insufficient without passion.”
In order to develop a new scale for measuring displayed passion, three independent coders
analyzed two questions the angels responded to: What specific behavior or attitudes would
represent an entrepreneur with a high (low) level of passion? The responses fell into three
categories, which were consistent with the affective, cognitive, and behavioral passion distinction
made by Chen and colleagues (2009). However, the specific items contained in each category
differed from those presented previously. Displayed affective passion included factors related to
how much enthusiasm and excitement the entrepreneur displayed in their presentation to the
angels. Specific items identified included “tone of voice,” “eye contact and intensity of
verbalization”, energetic and enthusiastic presentation of business/ideas,” “high energy and a
positive attitude.” Displayed cognitive passion reflected preparedness, or the extent to which the
entrepreneur appeared knowledgeable and focused mentally on their venture. Specific comments
made by the angels included the following: “deep and thorough knowledge of his business

model,” “to display extensive knowledge of the key issues.” “knowing their field, product and/or
idea cold, and “has thought about objections and has clearly defined answers.”
Displayed behavioral passion items reflected the amount of personal commitment the
entrepreneur has demonstrated to their business including how much personal financial investment
they have made. Sample comments from the angels include “committing significant time and
resources to the project,” “willing to put his own money at risk,” “commitment of time, career, and
money,” and “personal sacrifice, commitment to the business, long hours (years in some cases)
developing the company business.” Based on angel responses to these open-ended questions we
created three scales for use in Study 2: displayed affective passion (enthusiasm), displayed
cognitive passion (preparedness), and displayed behavioral passion (commitment). Specific items
for each scale are indicated in Figure 1.
Study 2
In study 2, we used the displayed passion scale developed in study 1, and examined the
relationship between displayed passion, angel assessments of perceived passion and how far the
entrepreneur got in the funding process.
We used 60 videotaped screening presentations entrepreneurs made to one of the largest US
angel investment groups, the Teach Coast Angels group. As of February 2009, this group had
made investments in over 150 companies totaling over $99 million (TCA, 2009). TCA has
approximately 300 angels across five chapters in California. Angel participants in this study were
part of the Orange County chapter of TCA. In the normal TCA funding process, entrepreneurs fill
out an online application and are then pre-screened by 3-5 angels. If the angels determine the
entrepreneur should go further, they give a full screening presentation. These presentations are
typically made to 10-20 angels.
Videos were collected at screenings made to the Orange County chapter of TCA between July
2006 and March of 2009. In each video, the presenting entrepreneur made a 15 minute
presentation following by 15 minutes of Q&A. The full 30 minutes were coded for this study.
Each coder responded to the video in terms of scales described below to assess the displayed
passion (enthusiasm, preparedness, and commitment) of the presenter. Coding of videos was
completed in two separate steps. In the first step, five researchers coded 10 presentations. The
overall inter-rater reliability for the 10 presentations was .896. This gave us confidence that the
coding was consistent and that we could proceed to step two, where the remaining 50 videos were
assessed by three of the five original coders. The inter-rater reliability for these 50 videos was
.872. One company was dropped from the analysis due to the determination it was an outlier due
to a negative Cronbach’s alpha among coders.. The resulting sample included 59 video—taped
entrepreneurs.
Measures of displayed passion. The displayed passion scale developed in study 1 contains
three types of displayed passion – displayed enthusiasm (affective passion), displayed
preparedness (cognitive passion), displayed commitment (behavioral passion). Reliability for two
of the three displayed passion scales were high. The Cronbach’s alpha of .937 for displayed
enthusiasm and .844 for displayed preparedness are comparable to Chen, et al. (2009) alphas for
similar scales of .94 and .90, respectively. In addition, we measured displayed commitment but
only achieved a Cronbach’s alpha of .444 for this three item measure. The correlations among the
three scales were low (ranging from -.033 to .366), indicating that while they are correlated, they
are not redundant scales.

<-----Page 9----->Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, Vol. 29 [2009], Iss. 2, Art. 1

Measures of perceived passion. When each screening presentation was initially made, angel
investors assessed the overall passion and enthusiasm demonstrated by the entrepreneur at the time
of their presentation. The passion item was “CEO is very passionate about the company” and the
enthusiasm item was “CEO is very enthusiastic.” This measure of perceived passion was done at
the screening stage of the angel funding decision process.
Measure of evaluation of funding potential. Angels evaluate the funding potential of a new
venture at various stages of the funding decision process, creating multiple points where an
entrepreneur can fail to proceed to the next stage of the funding decision process. Two dependent
variables were utilized in this study, interest at the screening stage and investment at the funding
stage. Interest represents the evaluation angels make at the end of the screening stage: whether the
angel expresses interest in the new venture as an investment which we coded as 1 = interest and 0
= no interest. The second dependent variable, measured at the funding stage, indicates whether the
angel invested in the new venture. A dichotomous variable was created with 1 indicating an angel
invested in a new venture and 0 indicating no investment.
Control variables include the strength of the opportunity and the amount of funding sought.
Strength of the opportunity was determined by averaging the responses of angels attending the
focal screening. Angels used a 5 point agree-disagree scale to rate the strength of the opportunity
using six items, such as “the business model is strong”, “the market has a large growth potential”,
etc. The dollar amount of funding sought was standardized to make it more comparable to the
other variables.
Study 2 results. Table 1 provides means, standard deviations and correlations for variables
used in the study. Fairly low correlations among the independent variables indicate
multicollinearity is not an issue. In addition, our diagnostic tests indicate that the data do not
violate assumptions of linearity, normality, homoskedasticity, and independence. We tested our
hypotheses using hierarchical regression analyses to regress each of the dependent variables on
blocks of predictor variables. Table 2 provides the logistic regression results for both dependent
variables. Models 1-3 provide the results predicting interest in funding the new venture at the
screening stage and models 4-6 show results for investment in the new venture at the funding
stage. We controlled for strength of opportunity which was significant in all models and amount of
funding sought which was not significant in any of the models (Table 2, models 1 and 4).
Hypothesis 1 argues that displayed enthusiasm will be positively associated with progress
through the funding process. We did not find support for this hypothesis at either the screening
stage or the funding stage (Table 2, models 2 and 5). The results indicate that displayed
enthusiasm may be negatively related to interest at the screening stage but not related to whether
angels invest at the funding stage (b = -.294, p < .05; b = -.597, p > .05, respectively).
Hypothesis 2 proposes that displayed preparedness will be positively associated with progress
through the funding process. Support for this hypothesis was found at the funding stage but not at
the screening stage (b = .316, p > .05; b = 9.986, p < .05, respectively).
Results regarding hypothesis 3 are similar to the results regarding hypothesis 1. We did not
find support for the positive association of displayed commitment with either interest at the
screening stage or investment at the funding stage (Table 2, models 2 and 5). The results indicate
that displayed commitment may be negatively related to interest at the screening stage and not
related to investment at the funding stage (b = -.392, p < .01; b = 3.152, p > .05, respectively).

Hypothesis 4 suggests that perceived passion mediates the relationships between displayed
passion (enthusiasm, preparedness, and commitment) and funding progress. Baron and Kenny
(1986) provide a framework using regression to test for mediation. Variable M is considered a
mediator if the following criteria are met: 1) X significantly predicts Y, 2) X significantly predicts
M, and 3) M significantly predicts Y when controlling for X (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Preacher &
Hayes, 2004). Following this framework, perceived passion does not appear to mediate the
relationships between types of displayed passion and progress in the funding process due to one or
more of these three criteria not being met (Tables 2, models 3 and 6; Table 3, model 2). However,
researchers argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects to overcome
the shortcomings inherent in the Baron and Kenny method (i.e. Holmbeck, 2002; MacKinnon,
Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002; Preacher & Hayes, 2004).
Evidence of mediation exists if the indirect effect of X on Y when M is present differs from the
direct effect of X on Y (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). Statistically testing if these two effects differ is
more robust than conducting a series of regression analyses (MacKinnon et al., 2002; Preacher &
Hayes, 2004). The Sobel test provides a more direct test of an indirect effect but assumes normal
distribution of errors (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). A more conservative approach is not to assume
normal distributions and use a bootstrap test (Lockwood & MacKinnon, 1998). Preacher and
Hayes (2004) provide the framework and necessary SPSS syntax to test for significance with the
Sobel test and a bootstrapping test.
Table 4 shows the results of the Preacher and Hayes (2004) Sobel and bootstrap test using the
unstandardized path coefficients. The Sobel test and the bootstrap indicate perceived passion has a
mediating effect on the relationships between the three types of displayed passion and interest at
the screening stage but not investment at the funding stage. Perceived passion appears to mediate
the relationship between displayed enthusiasm and interest as determined by the Sobel test (z =
4.73, p < .01), as well as the bootstrap test which indicates the indirect effect is different from zero
with 99% confidence. In other words, although displayed enthusiasm by itself does not lead to or
prevent angel interest at the screening stage (b = -.121, p > .05), there is a part of displayed
enthusiasm that is positively related to perceived passion (b = .264, p < .01) and is positively
related to interest at the screening stage (b = .735, p < .01). The part that is not related to
perceived passion is in fact negatively related to interest at the screening stage (b = -.320, p < .01).
With regards to displayed preparedness, the results indicate that displayed preparedness does
have an indirect effect on interest, with the effect occurring through perceived passion. Although,
the positive relationship between displayed preparedness and interest is not statistically significant
(b = .284, p > .05), the relationship is smaller after controlling for perceived passion (b = .083, p >
.05). The bootstrap output shows that the indirect effect is different from zero with 99%
confidence and the Sobel test also indicates a statistically significant indirect effect exists (z =
3.26, p < .01).
Finally, the mediating effect of perceived passion on the relationship between displayed
commitment and interest at the screening stage is similar to when examining displayed enthusiasm
with the exception of a statistically significant negative relationship between displayed
commitment and angel interest at the screening stage (b = -.363, p < .01). However, there is a part
of displayed commitment that is positively related to perceived passion (b = .156, p < .01) and is
positively related to interest at the screening stage (b = .728, p < .01). The part that is not related
to perceived passion is negatively related to interest at the screening stage (b = -.496, p < .01).

Therefore, we find support for hypothesis 4 when examining interest at the screening stage but not
investment at the funding stage.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Theoretical developments have argued that passion is a critical component of entrepreneurship.
This paper adds to the literature by providing an empirical assessment of the extent to which these
theoretical arguments hold true for angel investment decisions. This should help both angels and
entrepreneurs seeking their funding to better understand the dynamics of these investment
decisions. It also is one of the first empirical studies of the role of passion in entrepreneurship,
and the first to examine the impact of displayed passion on angel investor decision-making.
Research implications and areas for future research
As expected, displayed enthusiasm (affective passion) and displayed commitment (behavioral
passion) appear to lead to more perceived passion, as assessed by angel investors. However, these
two types of displayed passion were not expected to be negatively associated with interest at the
screening stage or investment at the funding stage. It appears that the relationship between
displayed passion and evaluations of funding potential angels make at both the screening and
investment stage of the funding process may be more complex than originally thought. Both
displayed enthusiasm and displayed commitment have aspects that lead to increased perceptions of
passion and also interest at the screening stage, but also have aspects that lead to decreased interest
at the screening stage. One possible explanation for these results could be related to literature
regarding individuals displaying emotions they do not feel in order to secure more positive
outcomes for themselves (Rafaeli and Sutton, 1987) or their organizations (Dashborough and
Ashkanasy, 2002). Angels may be weary of being influenced in this manner and therefore are
suspicious of some aspects of displayed passion. Future research can conduct a more fine-grained
examination of exactly what aspects of displayed enthusiasm and commitment are positively
associated with interest at the screening stage of the funding process, and which aspects have a
negative impact on interest.
The fact that perceived passion only had a mediating effect when predicting interest at the
screening stage of the funding process and not at the investment stage of the funding process
suggests that displayed enthusiasm (affective passion) and displayed commitment (behavioral
passion) will only get you only so far in the funding process. A strong opportunity appears to be
always important (as indicated in its statistical significance in all models), whereas the type of
displayed passion that matters changes as an entrepreneur progresses through the funding process.
This could be a result of temporary emotions elicited through the contagion process diminishing
over time (Bechara, et al., 2003). In the weeks or months between the presentation and the
investment decision, the passion the entrepreneur was able to convey to the angel, as well as the
angels recollection of displayed passion likely diminishes. However, displayed preparedness
(cognitive passion) does not seem to diminish over time. Although not directly related to either
perceived passion or interest at the screening stage, displayed preparedness is positively associated
with investment at the funding stage. Displayed preparedness may have a more lasting impact
than the other two types of displayed passion. This result is consistent with the findings of Chen
Yao, and Kotha (2009) who found that in evaluations of business plan presentations raters also
focused more on preparedness than on affective passion of the presenters. However, while those
authors propose three aspects of passion (affective, cognitive – preparedness, and behavioral –
commitment), they tested only the first two of these aspects, while we tested all three.

<-----Page 12----->Cardon et al.: IMPACT OF PERCEIVED ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION

While we focused on the mediating effect of perceived passion on the relationship between
displayed passion and important outcomes, there is a need for future research to continue to
explore how experienced passion differs from displayed passion and perceived passion in the
entrepreneurship context. Our somewhat surprising results concerning enthusiasm and
commitment may be due to angels sensing the entrepreneur is putting on an act and not displaying
authentic emotions. Therefore we need to use recently developed measures of the extent to which
entrepreneur really feel or experience passion (Cardon, 2008), as well as what this passion is
focused on (Cardon et al, 2009) in order to truly understand the nuanced relationships between
passion that is felt, displayed, and perceived, and how these factors influence angel funding
decisions. It may also be relevant to look at other characteristics of the entrepreneur (i.e.
personality, social skills, etc.) that might impact the level of displayed passion and perceived
passion. The amount of passion perceived by others likely is impacted by characteristics of the
entrepreneurs displaying such passion, as well as their skills such as social perception skills. We
hope that this study encourages future research to explore these types of relationships.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study that need to be noted. First, our measure of
displayed commitment (behavioral passion) had a low Cronbach’s alpha. We had only a three
item measure that reflected different possible manifestations of behavioral passion, and future
research is needed to examine what additional or alternative items could be used.
Second, since most new ventures at the screening stage of the funding process do not
ultimately receive funding, the number of cases at the funding stage was substantially smaller than
at the screening stage. 59 new ventures were screened by between 7 and 21 angels for a total of
860 observations. Of the 59 new ventures in the sample that reached the screening stage, 9
received funding, resulting in 109 observations involving both displayed passion data and data
regarding whether the angel invested. Most angels choose not to invest most of the time. This
results in a fairly low number of cases involving angels’ evaluations of the investment criteria who
subsequently invested in the new venture. Only ten of the 109 observations involve angels who
ultimately invested. This small sample size may explain the lack of support for some of the
hypotheses at the investment stage of the funding process.
Practical implications
The results suggest that entrepreneurs seeking funding from angel investors need to have a
good business idea and need to be able to display to potential investors that they are prepared,
meaning they have thought through the big picture and impact of their product or service and are
able to convey confidence and answer questions competently. In addition, their ability to convey
authentic enthusiasm and commitment to angels appears to be important in terms of increasing
angels’ initial interest in the venture. However, the relationships among the three aspects of
displayed passion, angels’ perceptions of perceived passion, and actual funding appear complex
and warrant further practical and academic study.
