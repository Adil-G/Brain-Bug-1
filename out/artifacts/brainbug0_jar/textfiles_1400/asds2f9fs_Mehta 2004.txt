BUILDING A BUSINESS

Paths to entrepreneurship in the life sciences
Shreefal Mehta
Many biotech companies are founded by scientists. But there is certainly a path, somewhat less trodden but
nonetheless viable, for the inspired entrepreneur who may not be a brilliant researcher.

Each year, over a million companies are
started in the US with about 5–10% (57,793
in 1998) of them classified as high technology companies1. Many nascent entrepreneurs
exist around us, and thinking about starting a
new venture is not an uncommon activity—in
fact at any given point in time, over 4% of the
working age population might be thinking of
an idea for a new venture2. Not surprisingly,
turning ideas into business ventures is tricky:
only about 10% of budding entrepreneurs have
a new firm in place within 12–18 months3; the
other 90% either fail to define a sound business model that can drive their business idea
forward to a new venture or realize their idea
was flawed.
A key ingredient in successful entrepreneurship is self-knowledge. If entrepreneurs know
their limitations and strengths, they may be
able to avoid some common pitfalls in starting
up a biotech company. In this article, I distinguish between two types of life sciences entrepreneurs and highlight the traits of each.
Turning science into business
Typically a new life science venture is started up
in the United States when a scientist, through
initial government or foundation grants, discovers a pathway or mechanism in biology
that is particularly interesting and appealing
for disease intervention or treatment. The
scientist then files a disclosure through the
university office and begins discussions with
the technology transfer or licensing officer at
the university about commercializing the discovery. She or he then writes a small business

innovation research grant to fund the startup
activities, rounds up some collaborators (other
scientists or business associates) and licenses
the discovery from the university.
The scientist-entrepreneur then has two
choices: either continue in the university
position while developing the company
on the side, or leave the academic position
(permanently or temporarily on a leave of
absence) to actively pursue the commercialization of his or her discovery. In the latter
case, funding comes from personal funds,
second mortgages on residences, loans,
friends, families and other angel investors and
venture capitalists. The venture is launched,
typically focused on products, with a business
model of forming a fully integrated company.
The steps in the venture creation process are
shown in Figure 1.
The opportunity-recognition step (Fig. 1) is
critical in new venture creation. This gestalt in
the entrepreneur’s perception of the relationship between the invention and final product3
is refined into a business model that describes
how the venture will make money or provide
an appropriate return to the potential investors. Over the years, entrepreneurs have shown
considerable ingenuity in inventing new business models to support life science ventures4.
The traditional entrepreneurial path
described above does not, however, appear to
be the exclusive route to life science venture
creation. On the basis of a survey of founders of biotech startups—comprising over 35
interviews with founders of biotechnology
firms carried out in 2003 as part of a larger
study5—it is clear there are alternative paths
to venture creation.
Less-trodden paths
Bioentrepreneurs have backgrounds as diverse
as individuals in any other walk of life. The
individual cases from the survey were chosen

because their experiences and entrepreneurial backgrounds are somewhat different from
the more typical scientific founders, the ‘technopreneurs,’ seen among the other company
founders in the survey. The entrepreneurs pro-

filed here who have followed a different path
to high-tech ventures have played no less of a
role in building biotech companies.
Case study no. 1. A large-pharma executive,
with no specific scientific or clinical training or experience, driven by a desire to be an
entrepreneur, met a scientist through a social
network contact and learned of his novel

1610

invention. This executive, wanting to break
off from his large company and be involved
in entrepreneurial activity, built a company
around this technology, which enables the
development and manufacture of biotherapeutic products. The core idea came from the
scientist, but the idea subsequently evolved
substantially around that core as the company
went through the early formation process.

Case study no. 2. A sales executive for a medical health care provider, trained as a physician,
came to understand the diagnostic industry
through conversations with his customers.
After identifying an unmet need, he used
internet research, publications and his social
network to assess the need for a new product.
Based on the positive feedback, he founded a
diagnostics company.
Case study no. 3. Working as a management
consultant in a noncapitalist economy, an
entrepreneur met a scientist who told him
about his ideas and research findings. The
consultant suggested founding a biotech
company based on the scientist’s ideas. They
made several attempts to start a biotech venture and found that there was a serious lack
of understanding of funding such startups in
their country. The entrepreneur and scientist
finally managed to come to the US and start
their own biotech business. They also set up
a subsidiary in their home country where the
bulk of research and development work is
being done. The company is now funded by
US venture capital and moving forward in
development.
Case study no. 4. A person with a bachelor’s
degree in biology took a technical training
course at a local medical research center that
was taught by a scientist who had been doing
R&D for diagnostic tests. The student realized
the opportunity for a business in providing
R&D diagnostic testing for drug development
and incorporated a company with technology
licensed from the medical research center.
The company has over a decade of successful
operation now.
Case study no. 5. An investment banker
started a medical device distribution business
and soon found that the main product line was
going to become obsolete. The company survived financially by continuing the distribution business while the banker and his partners
developed a new technology for a diagnostic
process service. Now they are marketing the
new technology and resulting products themselves.
Case study no. 6. Over 15 years ago, a scientifically minded businessperson read about
genetic testing in a magazine and thought that
the new technology would make a great business opportunity. His enthusiasm convinced
his spouse to get involved, too. He started a
business and it slowly evolved to a niche hightech service. After his death, his spouse took
over and has run the company successfully for
over 8 years now.

BUILDING A BUSINESS
Case study no. 7. A physician treating patients
with chronic diseases was not satisfied with
existing therapies and thought he would
venture out to form his own company and
develop a therapy for the clinical need he
had identified. He found a business-oriented
person to partner with and together they created a business plan, raised angel investment
and licensed in some key technologies from
universities that could address these diseases.
A partnership with another pharma/biotech
company has been established to bring in
applicable technologies, fund development
and to achieve rapid progress without investing heavily in basic R&D internally.
These examples illustrate that venture creation is not a linear process; rather, it is driven
by social networks, serendipitous meetings
and flashes of insight. The entrepreneurs
interviewed here vary in their previous experience from being skilled and technically adept
medical practitioners to businesspeople, none
with a specific technical background in the
technology around which they built their
companies.
Essentially, the case studies illustrate an
alternative to the more typical venture creation model in which a technopreneur is
the key driver and founder for the creation
of a new venture around his discovery or
invention. This second type of entrepreneur
(termed here as a ‘market perceiver’) recognizes a market need and builds a venture to
exploit that recognized opportunity. These
market perceivers typically have some exposure to the field, either through their association with scientists or their previous jobs in
the healthcare or pharmaceutical industry,
which allows them to recognize opportunities to start profitable ventures. However, they
are not the scientists who discover or invent
the technology. Unlike technopreneurs who
look for applications for their innovation, the
market perceivers identify a specific need in
the market and find or develop the right technology to address that need.
Technopreneurs and market perceivers
The technopreneur brings an internal
approach to the new venture (a technology
push), whereas the market perceiver uses an
external path (a market pull) to technological entrepreneurship. The former model can
be viewed as a hammer hunting for a nail (a
technology looking for an appropriate market
need), whereas the latter is akin to a nail sticking up. As distinct as these two approaches
are, there is clearly some mix of the two that
occurs in startup processes, as presented in the
case studies here and in other recent studies
of this phenomenon6, which can be summed

up as ‘hammer-nail codevelopment.’ For
example, in the typical life sciences venture, the technical founders usually bring
in outside management (with guidance
from venture capitalists and investors) to
add market perspective as the new venture
starts to grow7.
Most biotech entrepreneurs belong in
one of these two groups, each with its own
strengths and weaknesses, knowledge of
which can be useful when building a business. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the
venture creation process steps from each
perspective, with the strengths and weaknesses of each type of founder and some
recommendations and suggestions for
improving performance.
Summary
Most high-tech companies have founders with high levels of technical expertise.
Biological science is complex and rapidly changing and requires a specialized
knowledge to understand the value of the
innovation and its competitive position in
the industry8. Although life scientists are
typically the founders of biotech companies, studies have shown that the most successful high tech startups are founded by a

team of two to three individuals with mixed
backgrounds, substantial industry experience
and a very clear market and product focus at
founding5,9,10.
Although some studies have shown mixed
results when correlating founders’ backgrounds with the success of new ventures, a
recent survey of biotech and telecommunication firms shows that self-identified high
levels of technical expertise of founders are
negatively correlated with the financial performance of these firms11. Other reports analyzing high-tech ventures and their founders
have also accentuated the need for teams with
a diversity of skills. For example, Utterback
et al.12 observe that “having little diversity of
management skills... meaning only technical... skills, almost guarantees that the firm
will grow slowly”; Deeds et al.13 also conclude
that “overreliance on technical personnel in
the management of the organization detracts
from the product development process.”
In life sciences ventures, there are established
paths to venture creation—namely that of the
technopreneur—that have worked and continue to work successfully to give returns to
investors and other stakeholders in the market.
However, as described here, there is another
path, less-trodden in the public view, but

1611

equally viable for successful venture creation in
the life sciences, namely that of the market perceiver. A technopreneur might have difficulty in
taking on all of the positive aspects of a market
perceiver’s aptitude, skills and mental processes,
just as a market perceiver might find it difficult
to evaluate and determine technical milestones,
capabilities and limitations14. Clearly, a successful beginning for a life sciences startup would be
to build a team of people bringing all aspects of
these two distinct approaches together as soon
as possible so that all the stakeholders in the
new venture benefit from the best marriage of
business and technology.
