Abstract
Before technological change leads to new processes, products,
markets, or ways of organizing, entrepreneurs must discover
opportunities in which to exploit the new technology. To date,
research has not explained adequately why entrepreneursdiscover these opportunities, which creates several conceptual
problems in the entrepreneurshipliterature. Drawing on Austrian economics, I argue that opportunitydiscovery is a function
of the distribution of information in society (Hayek 1945).
Through in-depth case studies of eight sets of entrepreneurs
who exploit a single MIT invention, I show that entrepreneurs
discover opportunities related to the information that they already possess. I use these findings to draw several implications
that differ from those prevailing in the entrepreneurshipliterature, including: (1) entrepreneursdo not always select between
alternative market opportunities for new technologies; (2) the
source of entrepreneurship lies in differences in information
about opportunities; (3) the results of prior studies of entrepreneurial exploitation may suffer from bias; and (4) individual
differences influence the opportunities that people discover,
how their entrepreneurial efforts are organized, and how the
government can influence this process.

Introduction
Technological change provides the basis for the creation
of new processes, new products, new markets, and new

ways of organizing; and entrepreneurshipis central to this
process (Schumpeter 1934, p. 66). However, before technological change results in this process of entrepreneurial
exploitation, entrepreneursmust discover opportunitiesin
which to use the new technologies. Because opportunities
do not appear in a prepackaged form (Venkataraman
1997), this process of opportunity identification is far
from trivial. In any given new technology, entrepreneurs
could fail to identify any opportunities, or could identify
the wrong opportunities, making an explanation for the
discovery of opportunities an important part of the domain of entrepreneurshipresearch.
Unfortunately, most research on entrepreneurshipinvestigates the entrepreneurialprocess after opportunities
have been discovered (Fiet 1996). Researchers typically
adopt this approach because they draw on neoclassical
economic or psychological theories that assume people
will discover the same opportunities in a given technological change (Khilstrom and Laffont 1979), or discover
opportunities that are uncorrelated with the attributes of
the discoverers (Evans and Jovanovic 1989). Austrian
economics challenges the validity of these assumptions,
arguing that different people will discover different opportunities in a given technological change because they
possess different prior knowledge (Venkataraman1997).
Because the accuracy of these assumptions has important
implications for the development of entrepreneurshiptheory, I explore them in this article.
Through in-depth case studies of entrepreneurswho exploit a single MIT invention, I show results that challenge

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

the core assumptions of neoclassical economic and psychological approaches to entrepreneurship.In particular,
I show that (1) any given technological change will generate a range of entrepreneurialopportunities that are not
obvious to all potential entrepreneurs;(2) entrepreneurs
can and will discover these opportunities without searching for them; and (3) any given entrepreneurwill discover
only those opportunitiesrelated to his or her prior knowledge (Venkatarman 1997). This evidence supports the
Austrian argument that the discovery of entrepreneurial
opportunities depends, in part, on the distribution of information in society (Kirzner 1973) and provides important implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurship.
This article is organized as follows. In the next section,
I review extant perspectives on entrepreneurship and
identify important implications of the differences between them. In the third section, I develop specific propositions from Austrian economics about the discovery of
entrepreneurialopportunities. In the fourth section, I describe the methodology used to examine these propositions. In the fifth section, I review the empirical support
for these propositions. In the final section, I discuss the
implications of these results for entrepreneurshipresearch
and practice.

Entrepreneurship Theories
Explaining the discovery of entrepreneurialopportunities
requires assumptions about the nature of the entrepreneurial process. To date, research on entrepreneurship
falls into three schools of thought, each with different
assumptions about this process.
Neoclassical Equilibrium Theories
Neoclassical economists (e.g., Khilstrom and Laffont
1979) have proposed equilibrium theories of entrepreneurship. Equilibrium theories assume that markets are
composed of maximizing agents whose collective decisions about prices clear markets. In the equilibrium
framework, no one can discover a misalignment that
would generate an entrepreneurialprofit because, at any
point in time, all opportunities have been recognized and
all transactions perfectly coordinated. Because an equilibrium framework does not allow people to recognize
opportunities that others do not see, equilibrium theories
explain entrepreneurshipby identifying individuals who
prefer to become entrepreneurs.For example, Khilstrom
and Laffont's (1979) model proposes that people with a
greater taste for uncertainty will choose to become entrepreneurs, whereas people with a lesser taste for uncertainty will choose to become employees. In short, equi-

librium theories assume that (1) everyone can recognize
all entrepreneurialopportunities, and (2) fundamental attributes of people, rather than information about opportunities, determine who becomes an entrepreneur.
Psychological Theories
Psychologists (e.g., Begley and Boyd 1987, McClelland
1961) have proposed theories in which entrepreneurship
is a function of stable characteristics possessed by some
people and not others. According to this perspective, enduring human attributes-such as need for achievement
(McClelland 1961), willingness to bear risk (Brockhaus
and Horowitz 1986), self-efficacy (Chen et al. 1998) internal locus of control, and tolerance for ambiguity (Begley and Boyd 1987)-lead some people and not others
to choose entrepreneurship. The psychological framework generally focuses on the decision to exploit opportunities rather than on their discovery (Venkataraman
1997). However, when researchers from this perspective
explore opportunity discovery, they typically argue that
discovery depends on relative differences between people
in their willingness and/or ability to search for and identify opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman,2000). For
example, they argue that superior information processing
ability, search techniques, or scanning behavior make
some people more able or willing to discover opportunities (Shaver and Scott 1991). In short, psychological
theories explicitly or implicitly assume that (1) fundamental attributesof people, ratherthan information about
opportunities, determine who becomes an entrepreneur;
and (2) this process depends on people's ability and willingness to take action.
Austrian Theories
Austrian economists believe that equilibrium approaches
fail to offer a satisfying theoretical framework for understanding marketprocesses. They believe that a viable theory of a market system cannot assume equilibrium but
must explain how a market would achieve that equilibrium from nonequilibrium initial conditions (Kirzner
1997). The Austrians assume that markets are composed
of people who possess different information (Hayek
1945). The possession of idiosyncratic information allows people to see particular opportunities that others
cannot see, even if they are not actively searching for such
opportunities. Differences in information lead people to
see different value in a given good or service and offer
different prices to obtain it. By buying or selling goods
and services in response to the discovery of price misalignments, an individual can earn entrepreneurialprofits
or incur entrepreneuriallosses. Collectively, this process

449

<-----Page 3----->SCOTT SHANE

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

of decision making about prices moves an economy from
disequilibrium to equilibrium. In short, Austrian theories
assume that (1) people cannot recognize all entrepreneurial opportunities; (2) information about opportunities, rather than fundamental attributes of people, determine who becomes an entrepreneur;and (3) this process
depends on factors other than people's ability and willingness to take action.
The Implications of the Differences
Empirical investigation of the Austrianperspective on entrepreneurshipis important because the Austrian framework provides different explanations for the discovery,
exploitation, and organization of entrepreneurialopportunities from those provided by neoclassical economic
and psychological frameworks. First, unlike neoclassical
economic theory, Austrian economics does not view the
process of opportunity discovery as mechanical. Neoclassical economics' assumption of public knowledge
about opportunities means that all opportunities must be
equally "obvious" to everyone. Because any given entrepreneurcan discover the complete set of opportunities
that occur in response to a given technological change,
neoclassical economics argues that entrepreneurs select
between different opportunitiesthrough a process of maximization (Khilstrom and Laffont 1979, Evans and Jovanovic 1989). However, Kirzner (1973, p. 33) explains
that once the assumption of complete information is relaxed, the discovery of opportunity cannot be understood
through "mechanical computation" because any given
individual cannot identify all possible opportunities. If
any given entrepreneurcannot necessarily discover more
than one commercial application for any given technological change, then entrepreneurscannot actively select
(let alone maximize) between alternative opportunities
(Kirzner 1985).
Second, unlike both neoclassical economics and psychology, Austrian economics provides an explanation for
the entrepreneurialprocess that does not depend on the
identification of people who are more likely than other
people to become entrepreneurs. Because the Austrians
believe that the possession of information that is appropriate to a particularopportunityleads to opportunitydiscovery, they do not believe that anyone is more likely
than anyone else to become an entrepreneuracross all
opportunities. This distinction is important because the
episodic nature of entrepreneurshipmakes stable attributes an unlikely explanation for people's decision to become entrepreneurs (Carroll and Mosakowski 1987).
Moreover, no individual-level attributes or behaviors
have been found to generate significant differences be-

450

tween entrepreneurs and other members of society that
are robust, consistent across different samples, or explain
much variance (Busenitz and Barney 1997).1
Third, unlike both neoclassical economics and psychology, Austrian economics considers opportunity exploitation to be endogenous to opportunity discovery.
Much of the existing empirical evidence on opportunity
exploitation has assumed that the attributesof people who
discover opportunities are uncorrelatedwith the attributes
of the opportunities that they discover (Evans and
Jovanovic 1989). Researchers making this assumption
have studied how individual differences affect the way
people exploit opportunities while ignoring attributes of
the opportunities themselves. However, if human attributes are correlated with the opportunities that people discover, then these researchers have confounded attributes
of entrepreneurs and opportunities in empirical tests of
who is an entrepreneur (Venkataraman 1997). For instance, studies comparing entrepreneursto managers that
do not consider whether individual differences influence
the opportunities discovered (e.g., Kaish and Gilad 1991,
Chen et al. 1998) cannot tell whether entrepreneursdiffer
from managers because they possess different attributes
or because entrepreneursare responding to valuable opportunities and managers are not.
Fourth, the Austrian explanation for entrepreneurship
generates different implications from the other two
frameworks for who becomes an entrepreneur,how entrepreneurialefforts are organized in the economy, and
how the government can influence the entrepreneurial
process. For example, neoclassical economists have argued that general purpose technologies should be exploited by a single entrepreneuracross different market
applications because such centralization minimizes duplication of effort and contracting costs, and increases
economies of scale and scope (Bresnahanand Trajtenberg
1995). However, if people do not discover the same entrepreneurial opportunities in a given new technology,
then decentralized commercial exploitation of general
purpose technologies is advantageous. Centralization of
new technology development will lead to underidentification of opportunities because no central agent
can identify all possible entrepreneurialopportunitiesfor
a new technology (Nelson 1987).
Given the importance of explaining opportunity discovery to our understandingof the entrepreneurshipprocess, empirical evidence that supports or refutes the Austrian perspective on the discovery process is important.
In the next section, I generate specific propositions from
the Austrian framework, which I then examine empirically.

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

Conceptual Model and Propositions
InformationAsymmetry and the Nonobviousnessof
Opportunity
Entrepreneurialopportunities are opportunities to bring
into existence new goods, services, raw materials, and
organizing methods that allow outputs to be sold at more
than their cost of production (Casson 1982). These opportunities exist because different people possess different information (Kirzner 1997). Incomplete information
means that in any market transaction, people must guess
each other's beliefs about many things (Kirzner 1973).
Because these guesses can be incorrect, this process
sometimes leads to errors that misallocate resources. The
entrepreneurial process occurs when someone, alert to
this misallocation, recognizes that resources are not being
put to their "best use," obtains the resources, recombines
them, and sells them at more than they cost to obtain and
recombine (Casson 1982).2
People do not recognize the value of all opportunities,
thus allowing entrepreneursto obtain resources at below
their equilibrium price (Venkataraman1997). If resource
owners recognized the same opportunities that entrepreneurs discovered, they would want to appropriatethe entrepreneurialprofit by selling (or renting) their resources
to the entrepreneurat the price that would leave the entrepreneurwith just enough profit to act (Casson 1982).
Moreover, if all potential entrepreneurs recognized the
same opportunities, they would compete for the profit.
This competition would lower each entrepreneur's share
of the entrepreneurialprofit to the point at which it did
not provide potential entrepreneurswith an incentive to
act (Fiet 1996).
Given that information asymmetry is necessary for entrepreneurial opportunities to exist, everyone in society
must not be equally likely to recognize all opportunities.
Rather, only a subset of the population is able to recognize any particularopportunity at any particularpoint in
time (Kirzner 1973). The above argumentleads to the first
proposition.
1. All individuals are not equally likely
to recognize a given entrepreneurial opportunity.
PROPOSITION

search when the benefit of the information outweighs the
cost of obtaining it (Stigler 1961). Several empirical entrepreneurship researchers have incorporated this approach into their theories of entrepreneurship(see Baron,
forthcoming; Shaver and Scott 1991). They argue that
people discover opportunities because their superior information processing ability, search techniques, or scanning behavior make them more likely than other people
to discover opportunities (Shaver and Scott 1991).
Austrian economists have challenged this approach,arguing that people do not search for entrepreneurialopportunities because "opportunity, by definition, is unknown until discovered"; and one cannot search for
something that one does not know exists (Kaish and Gilad
1991, p. 38). Kirzner (1997, p. 71-2) explains that
An opportunity for pure profit cannot, by its nature be the object
of systematic search. Systematic search can be undertaken for
a piece of missing information but only because the searcher is
aware of what he does not know and is aware with greater or
lesser certainty of the way to find out the missing
information. .... But it is in the nature of an overlooked profit
opportunity that it has been utterly overlooked, i.e., that one is
not aware at all that one has missed the grasping of any
profit. . .. What distinguishes discovery (relevant to hitherto
unknown profit opportunities) from successful search (relevant
to the deliberate production of information which one knew one
had lacked) is that the former (unlike the latter) involves the
surprise that accompanies the realization that one had overlooked something in fact readily available.

The above argument suggests that people do not discover entrepreneurial opportunities through search, but
through recognition of the value of new information that
they happen to receive through other means. The discovery of opportunities in the absence of search is an importantpartof the Austrian frameworkbecause it explains
why entrepreneurshipis not solely a function of differences in human ability or willingness to take action (Kirzner 1997). The above argument leads to the second proposition.
PROPOSITION2. People can and will discover entrepreneurial opportunities without actively searching for
them.

The Discovery Process
Before an individual can earn an entrepreneurialprofit
from an opportunity, he or she must discover that it has
value. Two alternative explanations exist for this discovery process: search and recognition. Several authors (e.g.,
Stiglitz 1994) have argued that opportunitydiscovery depends on relative differences in search costs among potential entrepreneurs.The search model assumes that people know the outcomes for which they are searching and

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery Process
Why do people discover some entrepreneurialopportunities and not others? One answer is that people recognize
those opportunities related to information that they already possess (Venkataraman 1997). People have different stocks of information because information is generated through people's idiosyncratic life experiences.
Moreover, because information is often distributed

451

<-----Page 5----->SCOTT SHANE

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

through a stochastic process, some people possess information that others do not have throughblind luck (Nelson
and Winter 1982). As a result, at any given time only
some people, and not others, will know about particular
customer problems, market characteristics,or the ways to
create particular products or services (Venkataraman
1997).
Each person's idiosyncratic prior knowledge creates a
"knowledge corridor" that allows him/her to recognize
certain opportunities, but not others (Venkataraman
1997). Priiorinformation, whether developed from work
experience, education, or other means, influences the entrepreneur's ability to comprehend, extrapolate, interpret,
and apply new information in ways that those lacking that
prior information cannot replicate (Roberts 1991). Therefore, even if information about a technological change is
disseminated broadly-particularly if it is disclosed in a
patent, presented at a scientific conference, or known to
several individuals who might work in the same laboratory-only some subset of the population will possess
prior information that will trigger the discovery of a particular entrepreneurialopportunity. Three major dimensions of prior knowledge are important to the process of
entrepreneurial discovery: prior knowledge of markets,
prior knowledge of ways to serve markets, and prior
knowledge of customer problems.
New information about a technology might be complementary with prior information about how particularmarkets operate, leading the discovery of the entrepreneurial
opportunity to require prior information about those markets. Importantprior knowledge about markets might include information about supplier relationships, sales techniques, or capital equipment requirements that differ
across markets (Von Hippel 1988). For example, a person
who had previously worked in a market as a customer,
manufacturer, or supplier might already possess information that is not publicly available about how a new
technology might influence that market. This prior information enables him or her to discover an opportunity in
which to use the new technology (Roberts 1991). The
above argument suggests the following proposition:
PROPOSITION 3a. People's prior knowledge about
markets will influence their discovery of which markets
to enter to exploit a new technology.

New information about a technology might be complementary with information about ways to serve markets,
leading the discovery of the entrepreneurialopportunity
to require prior information about these processes. An
entrepreneur's ability to recognize an opportunity in a
new technology might be enhanced by prior knowledge
about how the new technology could be used to create a

452

product or service. A new technology might change a
production process, allow the creation of a new product,
provide a new method of distribution, permit new materials to be used, generate new sources of supply, or make
possible new ways of organizing (Schumpeter 1934, p.
66). These different dimensions of opportunity necessitate different organizational and production decisions
about how to serve a market (Von Hippel 1988).
Recognizing these alternatives is difficult absent some
prior knowledge of how they relate. Therefore, Aldrich
and Wiedenmayer (1993) explain that the forms of new
organizations and the product or service lines that entrepreneurs establish are related to the organizational units
in which they previously worked. In addition, Boeker
(1988) explains that the functional background of semiconductor manufacturersinfluences the strategy that entrepreneursadopt in their new firms. The above argument
suggests the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 3b. People's prior knowledge about
how to serve markets will influence their discovery of how
to use a new technology to serve a market.

New information about a technology might be complementary with prior information about a customer problem, such that discovery of the entrepreneurialopportunity might require prior information about customer
needs. The locus of innovation often lies with the user of
a new technology because users cannot articulate easily
their needs for not-yet-developed solutions to problems
(Von Hippel 1994). Unless the recipient of technical information already shares much of the same tacit knowledge as the transmitter,knowledge transmission is either
impossible or prohibitively costly (Cohen and Levinthal
1990). Individuals who lack familiarity with the customer's problem find it difficult to recognize solutions to
those needs when the solutions come along (Roberts
1991). This process leads entrepreneursto startnew companies to solve customer problems that they learned from
working with users in their previous employment (Von
Hippel 1988). The above argument suggests the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 3c. People's prior knowledge of customer problems will influence their discovery of products
and services to exploit a new technology.

The conceptual model described above is summarized
in Figure 1. The figure illustrates that prior knowledge
moderates the relationship between the attributes of a
technology and the recognition of entrepreneurialopportunities. It also illustrates that prior knowledge moderates
the relationship between the attributesof the opportunity

as recognized and how the entrepreneurchooses to exploit the opportunity.

Research Design
This article reports the results of a detailed field study of
eight actual business opportunitiesto exploit a single MIT
invention: the three-dimensional printing (3DPTM) process.
The Technology3
The three-dimensional printing (3DPTM) process is a patented manufacturing technology, invented in 1989 by
four MIT faculty and doctoral students under the lead of
Professor Ely Sachs. According to the abstractof the patent, the 3DPTM process is "a process for making a component by depositing a first layer of a fluent porous material, such as a powder, in a confined region and then
depositing a binder material to selected regions of the
layer of powder material to produce a layer of bonded
powder material at the selected regions. Such steps are
repeated a selected numberof times to produce successive
layers of selected regions of bonded powder material so
as to form the desired component. The unbonded powder
material is then removed. In some cases the component
may be further processed as, for example, by heating it
to further strengthen the bonding thereof."
Procedure
I used a case study design to examine the eight new venture opportunities to exploit the 3DPTM process. The case
study design allows investigation of how opportunitydiscovery operates in a real-world environment in which decisions actually take place, provides evidence in a situation in which all of the relevant behaviors cannot be
manipulated through experimental design, and allows the
incorporation of a variety of different sources of evidence, including both archival documents and interviews
(Yin 1984).
In late 1997 and early 1998, I conducted an in-depth

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCENVol. 11, No. 4, July-August

2000

field study of the eight entrepreneurial opportunities,
which involved a set of field interviews with the entrepreneurs, their investors, and others involved in the evaluation or exploitation of the opportunities.The interviews
were unstructuredand lasted from one-half hour to three
hours. The interviews typically began with an invitation
to describe how the entrepreneurlearned of the 3DPTM
process. With many respondents, I conducted follow-up
interviews and phone calls to clarify issues. For each interview, I tape-recorded the conversation and then
worked from the tape transcriptions.In total, I conducted
30 hours of interviews with 22 individuals.
In qualitative case study research, corroborationof interviews through the use of archival records is important
to validate information (Yin 1984). Therefore, the interview data were supplemented with information from
other sources. I had access to MIT Technology Licensing
Office (TLO) files on the entrepreneurs,which included
copies of business plans, press releases, contracts,product
information, and correspondence. I conducted Diolog,
Lexis-Nexis, and ABI Inform searches for articles about
the companies and entrepreneurs.I also obtained venture
capital and other financing records on the companies from
database providers. Finally, I conducted patent and article
citation searches on the companies and entrepreneurs.
An embedded case study design, in which the unit of
analysis was the entrepreneurialopportunity, was used to
analyze the data. Following Yin (1984), separate case
studies on each of the eight opportunities were developed
from the interviews, database information, and archival
records. Reliability was established through the development of a case study protocol and a case study database
(Yin 1984). The case study protocol included the use of
"table shells" to record data (Miles and Huberman
1984). These outlines ensured that the data collection was
focused on the process of opportunity discovery, verified
that the same information was being collected for all
cases, and aided in the data analysis. Construct validity
was established by using multiple sources of evidence,
the creation of a chain of evidence, and by having key
informants review drafts of the case study report (Yin
1984).
Pieces of information from the cases were compared to
the propositions to determine the degree to which they
were consistent, following the patternmatching logic recommended for case study design (Miles and Huberman
1984). The pieces of information were also compared to
rival, mutually exclusive propositions to determine the
degree to which they were inconsistent with alternative
explanations since case studies support a proposition if
the pieces of evidence uncovered are consistent with the

453

<-----Page 7----->SCOTT SHANE

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

proposition but inconsistent with alternativemutually exclusive explanations (Yin 1984).
Sample
Like all MIT inventions, the 3DPTMprocess was available
for commercialization throughlicense from the TLO. The
TLO grants three types of licenses: exclusive licenses to
use an invention in all fields of use, exclusive licenses to
use an invention in a particular field of use, and nonexclusive licenses to use the invention. The decision of
which type of license to establish is made during the process of evaluation by potential licensees and is a function
of several factors: the type of license requested, the types
of licenses that have already been granted, the amount of
money the licensee is willing to pay, the licensing officer's judgment about how the technology should be exploited, and any government or university policies that
would restrict the commercialization of the technology.
Licenses are typically granted after the entrepreneurs
have conducted preliminary investigation of the technology. During the preliminary investigation, the entrepreneurs are required to maintain confidentiality. For this
reason, the TLO maintains excellent records on all entrepreneurs who have investigated MIT inventions, whether
or not they ultimately license to them.
The TLO licensed the rights to use the 3DPTM process
to four teams of entrepreneurs who have created new
companies to exploit this technology in different fields of
use. The TLO also has records of four teams of entrepreneurs who discovered and investigated entrepreneurial
opportunities to exploit the 3DPTM process, but who
failed to start companies. Because all eight sets of entrepreneurs discovered entrepreneurialopportunities for the
same invention, comparison of these opportunitiesallows
me to explore the differences in business opportunities
discovered by different entrepreneursin response to the
same new technology. Table 1 shows the eight "companies," the entrepreneurs, and the opportunities that
they discovered. Astute readers will note that none of the
four inventors of the 3DPTM process chose to exploit this
technology by starting a new company.
Z Corp. Z Corp was founded by Marina Hatsopoulos,
Walter Bomhorst, Jim Bredt, and Tim Anderson to manufacture a fast, inexpensive, office-compatible machine
to make three-dimensional concept models for engineering and architecturaldesign. Design engineers and architects use concept models to review design changes early
in the design process and to present ideas to others who
cannot read CAD designs, but who are involved in the
design process. The Z Corp machine makes rapid prototypes 20 times faster than existing rapid prototyping processes and out of less expensive materials, reducing the

454

cost of prototyping, accelerating the process, and allowing for more design iterations.
Therics. Therics was founded by Walter Flamenbaum
to manufacturedrug delivery systems for the pharmaceutical industry. The 3DPTM process allows one to control
the amount, time, and sequence of drug delivery. This
allows drugs to be delivered in a way that ensures optimum blood drug levels, increasing drug efficacy and reducing side effects as compared to alternative drug manufacture processes.
Specific Surface Corporation. Specific Surface was
founded by Andrew Jeffery and Mark Parish to manufacture ceramic filters for the power generation market directly from computer drawings without tooling, dies, or
molds. The 3DPTM process allows Specific Surface to
manufacture filters with geometries and performance not
possible with alternative processes. This allows them to
provide customers with filters that more efficiently remove particulates from dirty hot flue gas streams, and
thereby provides customers with greater power generation efficiency.
Soligen. Soligen was founded by Yehorem Uziel to
provide foundries with the ability to postpone the design
and creativity of casting tooling until after the design is
proven thus eliminating the need to prototype tooling.
Soligen' s Direct Shell Production Casting (DSPC) is
based on the 3DPTM process and allows Soligen to make
a ceramic mold directly from a CAD model, using a powder and binder, without the need for wax forms or tooling.
This technology allows Soligen to develop cast metal
parts with a much shorter lead time and at a lower investment cost than is the case with existing technology,
allowing customers to speed product introduction.
3D Partners. Andrew Kelly proposed using the 3DPTM
process to a create a service bureau to provide architectural models. Currently,architecturalmodels are made by
hand in a time intensive manner that requires significant
craft experience. Using the 3DPT process, this business
would receive CAD drawings electronically and then
send back finished architectural models faster and at a
lower cost than existing alternatives.
3D Orthopedics. Stephen Campbell proposed using the
3DPTM process to provide custom-fitted orthopedic devices for the medical and dental market. Currently, diseased or injured bones must be replaced with cleaned cadaver bones, bone harvested from another part of the
body, or prefabricated artificial substitutes. The 3DPTM
process allows three-dimensional forming of a biologically compatible replacement bone that could be printed
out of any material and implanted.

3D Imaging. Lau Christianson and Todd Jackson proposed using three-dimensional printing to provide a modeling service for surgeons. Currently, surgeons must abstract from two-dimensional CAT scans and MRI images
when planning for surgery. The 3DPTM process would
allow the creation of multicolor, three-dimensional models of the human brain for surgical planning that would
reduce error and malpractice exposure.
Conferences. Michael Padnos proposed using the
3DPTM process to establish a chain of stores to make
three-dimensional heads and busts of people. Currently,
people purchase a large number of photographs of family
and friends. The 3DPTM process would create threedimensional sculptures for consumers from these photographs.

All Individuals Are Not Equally Likely to Recognize
a Given Opportunity: Examining Proposition 1
Although many people were exposed to information
about the invention of the 3DPTM process, very few entrepreneurialopportunitiesto exploit the technology have
been discovered. Since its invention in 1989, 3DPTM has
been described in patent applications, conference presentations, publications, a website, MIT technology licensing
office mailings, and industry consortium meetings. Several trade and popular publications-including Fortune,
the Financial Times, and the Economist-have written
stories about it. Yet only eight entrepreneurialopportunities for the 3DPTM process have been discovered.

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

The number of entrepreneurswho discovered entrepreneurial opportunities in the 3DPTM process was limited
because opportunities are not obvious from information
about the 3DPTM process alone. As Table 2 shows, in
none of the eight cases did the respondents indicate that
the opportunities were obvious from simple observation
of the 3DPTM process. For example, Walter Flamenbaum
(Therics) explains that MIT's 3DPTM process was far
from medically acceptable and not based on good manufacturing principles:
All of the 3DP lab's work was in one ceramic powder and one
fluid, and medical applications require multiple fluids and multiple powders, specifically polymers. You couldn't just look at
the 3DPTM process and know that you could use it for medical
purposes. To make use of 3DPTM process for drug delivery, you
had to know something about what drugs and drug delivery
systems are made from and how drug manufacture operates.

Moreover, none of the entrepreneursexamined any of
the other opportunities to use the 3DPTM process before

Table 2

The Nonobviousness

other entrepreneurshad disclosed them. As Marina Hatsopoulos (Z Corp) explains:
I absolutely could not have seen the business concepts that the
other licensees were doing. . .. I knew nothing about
casting. . .. Also, you could not make metal parts using the
3DPTM
process the way we use it .... You would have to think
of a different way to use the machine. What Specific Surface is
doing would never have occurred to me. And I don't think that
it would have ever have occurred to me in a thousand years that
you could print pills . .. like Therics does.

Consequently, none of the eight sets of entrepreneurs
discovered more than one opportunityin which to use the
3DPTM process, despite differences in the market size,
potential returns, or resulting outcomes of those opportunities. They also did not weigh the relative advantages
and disadvantages of using the technology to pursue different opportunities.
It is important to note that the evidence presented in
Table 2 and in the text above does not preclude the dissemination of new knowledge about inventions from influencing the discovery of opportunity. People who learn

"AllEly Sachs had was a small machine putting out something maybe every two days. This was not something that you
would think, we can use this for manufacturing. It wasn't clear that the binder MITwas using was compatible with
chemical binder systems to make ceramic filters, but we didn't think that the binder was limited to MIT'sbinder. Also,
to make filters you have to have to be able to produce something of very high quality. It has to have high building
integrity, cannot have any holes, and must hold together in a very hot environment. The MITprocess did not worry
about any of those things. In addition, the MITresearchers were not focusing on the creation of a finished product,
they were focusing on the creation of molds and prototypes that were intermediate steps. Moreover, they were
emphasizing accuracy and precision, which were not the exact areas of emphasis for our needs." Andrew Jeffrey

"They had a single jet printing machine, and the printer jet was something that MITmade from a syringe .... There
was no way to make a commercial machine with a single jet. To develop DSPC, one actually had to use a different

sequential layers of powder." Yehorem Uziel

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

about new knowledge before others may be more likely
to discover opportunities to make use of that new knowledge. In the interest of space, however, this paper held
the dissemination of new knowledge constant and explored only the influence of the distribution of prior
knowledge on the ability to recognize it. Therefore, this
study draws no conclusions about the effect of the dissemination of information on the discovery process.
The Process of Discovery: Examining Proposition 2
As Table 3 shows, the eight entrepreneursalso described
a discovery process which involved recognition, rather
than a search for information. In none of the cases did an
entrepreneurindicate that he or she was searching for the
opportunityprior to its discovery. For example, Mike Parrish (Specific Surface) explains, "When Mike Cima
showed me MIT's 3DP machine, I just thought that this
would make great filters. . . . The point is, we never
searched for this opportunity."
Moreover, none of the entrepreneurshad contacted the
TLO about a previous technology. Rather, each of the
entrepreneursheard about the technology from someone
directly involved in its development, and recognized the
opportunity immediately upon hearing about it. For example, Yehorem Uziel (SOLIGEN) explains, "When Ely
Sachs showed me MIT's 3DPT process, I just saw immediately that there was an opportunity to make functional metal parts directly from a computer."
When asked why they were able to discover opportunities when they were not searching for them, the respondents offered answers consistent with Austrian economics. In all eight cases, the respondents indicated that

Table 3

they simply recognized the opportunity, almost by accident, as if they were surprised by the discovery. For example, Walter Flamenbaum (Therics) explains:
If Bob Cohn, who has been responsible for drug delivery systems and product development at J&J had looked at it, it would
[H]e would have turned around and
have been different....
said, 'holy cow!' This is a platform that's wonderful for drug
delivery systems. If you had showed to someone who does tissue engineering, they would have said, 'holy cow!' This is wonderful for tissue healing matrices for our biological development
of tissues and organs. It's a matter of mind set and background.

The results also provide evidence that is inconsistent
with the argumentthat these entrepreneursdiscovered opportunities because they are better than others at searching for and discovering opportunities in general. If this
were the case, then the eight sets of entrepreneurs described here should have been more likely than other people but equally likely to each other to discover all the
opportunities. The empirical observation that each of
them was inferior at opportunity discovery for seven out
of the eight opportunities suggests that superiority at the
discovery process alone is not sufficient to explain the
discovery of opportunity. Rather, it suggests that such
superiority is situation-specific.
The Influence of Prior Knowledge on the Discovery
of the Market: Examining Proposition 3
Table 4 summarizes the relationship between different
dimensions of the entrepreneurs' prior knowledge and
their entrepreneurial efforts. As Table 4 indicates, all
eight sets of entrepreneurs used the 3DPTM process in
different markets, served the market in different ways,

and used the 3DPT process to provide solutions to different customer problems. In each case, the selection of
the market, the way to serve the market, and the solutions
to the customer problems were influenced by the entrepreneur's prior knowledge.
While the eight cases show that prior knowledge influences the discovery of opportunity, they also show that
many types of prior information influence this process.
As Venkataraman(1997) argued, the sources of the prior
knowledge that lead to opportunity discovery are idiosyncratic, resulting from work experience, personal
events, and education. Moreover, this prior knowledge
can be developed through a variety of roles, including
experience as a supplier, user, and manufacturer,and education on a variety of dimensions, such as productionprocesses, inputs, and user needs.
Identification of the Market. As Table 5 shows, all
eight sets of entrepreneurs discovered markets about
which they had prior knowledge. For example, Z Corp's
entrepreneursdiscovered the industrial design and architectural markets because Marina Hatsopoulos (Z Corp)
and Walter Bornhorst (Z Corp) had developed prior
knowledge of these markets through education and work
experience. Both Marina and Walter were trained at MIT

as mechanical engineers and had studied industrial design, which enabled them to see the industrialdesign market for the 3DPTM process.
Marina and Walter's previous experience in the architectural market also led them to see the applications of
the 3DPTM process in that market. Prior to founding Z
Corp, both Walter and Marina had undertakenmajor real
estate rehabilitations, in which they participated in the
architecturallayout and interior and exterior design. Because of their experience in both the industrialdesign and
architecture markets, Z Corp's entrepreneursdiscovered
a $100 million market for the 3DPTM process.
In contrast, the limited prior knowledge of the entrepreneurs who founded 3D Partnersled them to recognize
only the architecturalmarket in which to use the 3DPTM
process. Andrew Kelly (3D Partners)explains:
[The person who discovered the opportunity] was an
architect. ... We focused on ... the architectural market because it was the only market we knew anything about .... We
did not know anything about any other markets. . .. [But] the
architecturalmodel making industry nationwide is only $10 million, that's too small to build a company.

Yehorem Uziel's (Soligen) prior work experience also
led him to recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM process

The Selection of the Market

Examples of Respondents' Descriptions of the Selection of the Market, Not Quoted in the Text
"The value of the 3DPTM process to rapid prototyping inherently made sense to me because I've done design on a
computer screen and I know how difficult it is to visualize a three-dimensional model. For my thesis at MIT,I had to
do a very simple design. Even so, it was really a challenge doing all the drawings. Itwould have been easier to see
what the device would look like before I went ahead and actually built it. I also took this composites class and we
had to design a chair using composite materials. I thought it would be really neat to see what it would look like. So I
actually built a model out of foam core and string so I could understand my own design. I had this burning desire to
have that 3D model as I was doing the design .... It was natural to think of the architectural market because of my
personal experience. I've done a lot of architectural design. We've done renovations of buildings and in all those
cases there are certain views that get really tricky to visualize from a two-dimensional diagram. Architects are
designing very much in three dimensions and so for them, three-dimensional models are useful. Even more
importantly, architects are interacting with lay people who want to build a golf course or a house or whatever and
cannot read a CAD drawing at all."-Marina Hatsopoulos
"I immediately recognized how valuable it would be to have an object in front of me when I'm trying to sort out a threedimensional problem ... because I have struggled with trying to visualize three-dimensional things when I'm trying to
design something myself-"-Walter Bornhorst

Therics

"I had enough commercial experience in the pharmaceutical industry that I know what the markets are. I know about
drug delivery systems and thought about the percentage of that market that were for drugs that would benefit from
chronopharmacologic drug delivery. I knew that there were some huge markets like hypertension and angina that
you could clearly capture."-Walter Flamenbaum

Specific Surface

"The market was always filters for power plants. . . . I was working in gas filtrationwhen I saw the 3DPTM
process ... and I knew that large companies were looking for ways to improve the efficiency of ceramic filters. I
knew that people at ABB and Westinghouse were working on this issue."-Andrew Jeffrey

Soligen

"I was first introduced to the 3DPTM process when I was ... at 3D Systems and was working on rapid prototyping
machines for Ford .... Work with the automakers made me aware of the benefit of a machine that can make
functional metal parts .... For example, if you are Ford or GM and you are developing a new engine and [you have]
a lot of iterations at the beginning of the process . .. you gain by avoiding . . . temporary tooling to do the
casting .... If you can delay the creation of expensive artwork until after you know that there are no changes so you
can get the production tooling right the first time, that's a big thing .... So I was looking at undertaking a revolution
in the metal casting industry way before I even heard of Ely Sachs and Mike Cima."-Yehorem Uziel

3D Orthopedics

"I knew from the outset that there was a market to use the 3DPTM process to replace bones and teeth. My specialty is
prosthodontics, which means replacement of body parts with artificialsubstitutes. I was treating patients and running
an advanced education program at The Harvard School of Dental Medicine in this area at the time I learned about
the 3DPTM process. Before that I went to dental school at Virginia and then did a specialty training program in
prosthodontics at Harvard, with advanced materials training at MIT."-Stephen Campbell

"I have done a fair bit of work in health care economics and exploring different health care products. I was familiar with
health care markets and could speak about what goes on there. I knew that MRIand CAT scan came out in threedimensional form. I also knew about health care trends and that there was a market for things to improve surgery.
Finally, I knew that neurosurgeons are very technology friendly and would be interested in anything that could
possibly make their lives easier and make the surgery go more smoothly."-Lau Christianson

to a particular market. However, unlike Z Corp's founders, he developed this knowledge from his experience
as a supplier rather than as a user. Because he served as
vice president of engineering at 3D Systems, a rapid prototyping manufacturer, Yehorem recognized the useful-

460

ness of the 3DPTM process to the investment casting industry. As a supplier to Ford, General Motors, and
Chrysler, he learned that users of metal parts make hundreds of thousands of models and prototypes per year,
that they spend double the time on design tooling as they

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCENVol. 1 1, No. 4, July-August

<-----Page 14----->SCOTT SHANE

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

do on production tooling, and that they spend weeks on
making prototypes that the 3D process can make in a
matter of days.
Like Yehorem Uziel, the founders of Specific Surface
Corporation selected their market because of prior work
experience as a supplier to a market. Andrew Jeffery's
prior experience in product development as a supplier of
filtration media for coal burning power stations led him
to recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM process to the
power generation market. Because his previous job required him to identify new market opportunities for industrial filtration, Andrew became aware that ABB and
Westinghouse were searching for more durable and more
efficient ceramic filters to remove hot flue gas of particulates in response to recent environmental regulation.
Like the previous sets of entrepreneurs, Walter Flamenbaum's (Therics) selection of a market was influenced by his prior work experience. However, in Walter's
case, the prior knowledge was developed not as a user or
supplier, but as a manufacturer.Walter selected the pharmaceutical industry in which to use the 3DPTM process
because 25 years of experience in product development
and regulatory approval in that industry led him to see
the usefulness of the 3DPTM process to that market.
Stephen Campbell (3D Orthopedics) recognized the
usefulness of the 3DPTM process to a specific market because of his prior work experience and education. He
attributeshis discovery of the market to his advanced materials training at MIT and his work experience in prosthodontics. He explains:
I knew aboutthe new imagingtechnologiesthat were developing, as well as the materialsand the idea of providingthese
replacementbones just clicked. I saw that my little world of
dentalrestorationswas openingup to CAD/CAM.When the
3DPTMprocesscame along the whole idea of a serviceto provide replacementpartsjust clicked.

Lau Christianson and Todd Jackson (3D Imaging) also
selected the market in which to apply the 3DPTM process
because of their prior knowledge of the market.However,
in their case, the prior knowledge of the market appeared
far shallower than was the case with the other entrepreneurs. Lau Christianson was a Sloan student who had
worked in pharmo-economic and health care consulting
prior to attending Sloan.
Mike Padnos' (Conferences) selection of a market also
was influenced by prior knowledge of a market-in this
case consumer retail goods. However, Mike' s knowledge
was developed from work and personal experience. Mike
is in the art business and is a collector of sculpture. His
house is full of folk art, primarily sculptures of human
heads.

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 11, No. 4, July-August

2000

Identification of How to Serve the Market. As Table
6 shows, in all eight cases, the founders' prior knowledge
also influenced the choice of how to serve the markets.
Because Yehorem Uziel (Soligen) had previously
founded a manufacturerof capital equipment and had extensive experience in machine design and manufactureat
3D Systems, he recognized the opportunity to embody
the 3DPTM process in a machine rather than to provide a
service.
Z Corp also discovered an opportunityto serve markets
by selling a machine because of the prior knowledge of
the entrepreneurs. Marina Hatsopoulos' (Z Corp) mechanical engineering background allowed her to recognize the opportunity for a tangible electromechanical
physical product ratherthan a service; and Jim Bredt's (Z
Corp) experience in machine design allowed the Z Corp
team to recognize how to build low cost, office compatible machines that would serve the market in a better way
than an alternative service bureaubusiness model. Marina
Hatsopoulos (Z Corp) explains:
We envision the system as being placed right next to the designer in his office. The biggest advantage of using the 3DPTM
process for concept models is the speed and you lose that advantage if you have to wait to get a file from a customer, give
them a quote, get the file, do the backlog, print it out and send
it out .... You know that if the big advantage is that you can
print our part in an hour instead of ten hours, but you are going
to take 24 hours to get them the part, then what's the point?

In contrast to the founders of Z Corp, the founders of
3D Partnerswere unable to recognize a way to manufacture machines because of their lack of knowledge in the
area of machine design and manufacture. Andrew Kelly
(3D Partners)explains:
We could only discover the service market for architectural
models. To think of how to make machines that do concept
models, one would need a Ph.D. with expertise like Jim Bredt
(Z Corp) .... I was a second year master's student in Mechanical Engineering at MIT and had a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from NC State. I could run a Z Corp machine, but I couldn't create one. To make machines, you would
need to be familiar with things like infiltration kinetics. You
would need to know what you are doing with materials, what's
going on with powder and stuff like that. You would need to
know these things in grand detail. I mean down to the details
of how to capture droplets in space and infiltration time. The
list goes on and on, down to surface chemistry and fluid handling, delivery systems, general machine design, and a long list
of things that it takes to design a machine. These were not things
I knew.

Consequently, the entrepreneurs who founded 3D Partners recognized an opportunity which they later believed
to be inferior to the opportunity discovered by Z Corp.

Therics

"MITwas working with one binder solution and one powder and neither was a polymer nor a polyester. Drugs require
you to work with more than a single solution as well as with things like polymers and polyesters. My prior experience
in pharmaceuticals made it clear to me that they could do the same thing with these materials. Also MIThad a
bubble jet printer. I knew we had to change that. A bubble jet printer works by taking a liquid and making a bubble
by heating it and spitting it out the other end. You can't go to the Food and Drug Administration and convince them
that the liquid that went in is the same as the liquid that came out even though it went through a vapor phase. In
addition, if it's a liquid that is heat labile, you're screwed."-Walter Flamenbaum

Specific Surface

"Itwould have been impossible for us to engineer machines for the 3DPTM process. We are not mechanical engineers
like the people at Soligen. When we started Specific Surface Corporation we did not know how to make machines for
the 3DPTM process." -Mark Parrish
"The 3DPTM process seemed to answer a lot of the questions about what I was trying to do with other methods. I knew
a fair bit about rapid prototyping because I'd been exposed to it where I used to work .... The 3DPTM process offers
the possibility to eliminate a lot of manufacturing steps, down to really a handful of steps from design to finished
product. With this process, I can tip ceramic material into a machine, download a design, and make a ceramic filter
without any particular skill whatsoever. And that was what I saw as a really big advantage in making a functional
product."-Andrew Jeffrey

more value from this complexity. Informationfrom medical file data is one example of that."-Todd Jackson

Like founders of 3D Partners, the founders of 3D Imaging also discovered a service to exploit the 3DPTM process because they could not manufacturemachines. However, unlike 3D Partners, 3D Imaging's entrepreneurs
also had prior of knowledge of technology that would
generate greater value in the form of a service than in the
form of a machine. By exploiting a piece of complex
computer software, 3D Imaging could make direct use of
Todd's Ph.D. dissertation research on the processing of
composition information into machine instructions.
Andrew Jeffery and Mark Parrish (Specific Surface)
were similar to the founders of 3D Imaging in the influ-

462

ence of their prior knowledge on their discovery of how
to serve the market. Andrew Jeffery explains that their
lack of knowledge about machine design led them not to
discover an opportunity to manufacturemachines, but to
make filters using a modified Soligen machine.
Specific Surface's discovery of how to serve the market
was also influenced by anotherdimension of priorknowledge not present with any of the other entrepreneurs.Specific Surface Corporationuses the 3DPTMprocess to manufacture a final product through a one-stop manufacturing
process. Andrew saw the 3DPTMprocess as "a true manufacturing process right from the start" because he had

been looking at rapid prototyping as a way to reduce the
number of steps in the labor intensive process of making
filters in his previous product development job.
Similar to the other sets of entrepreneurs, Walter
Flamenbaum's (Therics) priorknowledge influenced how
Therics would serve the market. Unlike the cases of the
other entrepreneurs,however, the importantprior knowledge in Walter's case was an understanding of how one
serves a market that depends on government approval.
Because of his pharmaceutical experience, Walter recognized what materials could be substituted to make
drugs in place of the powders MIT was using and how to
change the MIT machine into one that would get FDA
approval.
Like the other entrepreneurs, Stephen Campbell (3D
Orthopedics) recognized a way to serve the market because of his prior work experience. However, unlike the
other entrepreneurs, Stephen recognized how to make
custom-fitted replacement bones from information
scanned from an MRI because his prior work experience
allowed him bring together the 3DPTM process and other
new technologies to which he was exposed.
Finally, Conference's discovery of how to serve the
market was also influenced by Mike Padnos' (Conferences) prior knowledge. Mike explained that Conferences
would establish retail establishments in malls because his
prior background in service businesses and personal experience led him to understand how to serve retail customers.
Identifying a Solution to the Customer's Problem. Table 7 shows that, in all eight cases, prior knowledge led the entrepreneurs to see the usefulness of the
3DPTM process in solving different customer problems.
The prior work experience of Z Corp's entrepreneursallowed them to see the 3DPTM process as a solution to the
customer problems of speed and cost. Because Jim
Bredt's (Z Corp) research often led him to use cannibalized computers and printers scavenged from junk piles,
he recognized the value of modifying a standard ink jet
print head to lower costs. Similarly, his education in materials science at MIT led him to notice that one could
use inexpensive starches as the powder for the system in
place of more expensive materials.
In contrast, Yehorem Uziel's (Soligen) prior experience as an inventor of a rival technology led him to recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM Process to solving a
set of customer problems that could not be solved by the
alternative of stereolithography. He explains:
In the future there will be no need for prototypes or mock-ups
because everything will be done in cyberspace. . .. One day
you'll be able to supplant most of the trial and error in engi-

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/VOl. 11, No. 4, July-August

2000

neering design with computer simulation. Moreover, rapid prototyping uses exotic fabrication processes that will never become production methods. For example, there is no way that
anyone will be able to drive a laser as fast as needed to create
something that will compete with the injection mold piece. So
rapid prototyping can never yield functional parts. Even if you
solidify a liquid which is exactly nylon, this is not the same
properties of nylon which is injection molding. The only way
to really address the concept of building parts from CAD is to
do something intermediary like make an expendable mold.
[Moreover,] plastic patterns are not durable enough and have
long-term dimensional instability (they may warp or distort as
time goes by and internal stresses are relieved.) For investment
casting, plastic patterns do not dissolve easily and may crack
the shells, and wax patterns made by laser sintering-which
involves joining wax powder particles into a wax object using
a laser beam-do not have the required accuracy and surface
finish. (Uziel, 1993: 3)

Andrew Jeffrey's (Specific Surface) prior knowledge
in product development at a filter manufacturerallowed
Specific Surface to recognize trends toward hot filtering
and smaller sized filters in power plants. In addition,
Mark Parrish's (Specific Surface) Ph.D. and extensive
work experience in ceramic engineering allowed him to
recognize the usefulness of the 3DPTM process in solving
a customer problem in different ceramics from those with
which MIT researchers had been working.
Like the other entrepreneurs, Walter Flamenbaum's
(Therics) prior knowledge led him to recognize the value
of the 3DPTM process to solving a customer's problem.
Because Walter had 25 years of experience in clinical
pharmacology and a research interest in cronopharmacology, he recognized how the 3DPTM process would
solve a problem with the treatment of hypertension.
Brad Vale, a venture capitalist at Johnson and Johnson
Development Corporationthat funded Therics, explained
why Walter Flamenbaum's backgroundled to the discovery of different solutions to customer problems than those
discovered by other entrepreneurs.He explains:
People always have a handful of unsolved medical industry
problems floating in the back of their heads. One of them is
artificial bone. People coming from that background went down
a particular path. On the other hand, people from a drug background start thinking what is the huge value added. That would
be complex drug delivery. They have the problem of drug delivery that matches up with daily cycles in the back of their
minds. This sends them down a different path from the medical
device people.

Unlike the other entrepreneurs, Stephen Campbell's
(3D Orthopedics) recognition of a solution to a customer
problem came from a combination of research, experience as a user, and prior education. At the time he learned

"Most of the people who looked at the technology were coming to it with a pretty specific need that was not quick and
dirty printing. Most of them wanted extreme accuracy and looked at three-dimensional printing from that point of
view. We saw. . . a quick and dirty way, almost a sloppy way to do what MITwas trying to do."-Walter Bornhorst

"There was a lot of evidence indicating that we were not appropriately treating high blood pressure because we
weren't appropriately taking into consideration the variations in blood pressure during the course of the day ....
Even when we give people drugs, there continues to be arterial sclerotic cardiovascular disease . . . because we
don't hit a morning rapid change in the rate of rise in blood pressure. If you can control the amount and time of drug
release to changes in blood pressure over a person's daily cycle, you can solve [these] problems .... If you are a
clinical pharmacologist . . . you look at something that you can control with microarchitecture and materials. I had
this 'chronopharmacological logic,' and intuitively looked at the technology and thought we could use it to
compartmentalize the release of drugs .... If you know this, seeing three-dimensional printing as a way to make
time release drugs is quite reasonable, intuitive reasoning."-Walter Flamenbaum

the 3DPTM process can make uniform porosity ceramics, which is an incredibly difficult thing to do .... I knew
about materials that were different than those that Ely and his people were using in the lab [and that] made it
possible to see how to make ceramic filters."-Mark Parrish

"There were two things that were happening. One, people didn't want to cool down gasses to filter them, everyone
wanted to filter hot at the source. Two, people want more compact filters .... To do that, you have to get more
surface area in the same volume or the same surface area in a smaller volume of filter. A trend was
emerging . . . with the rise of cartridge filter people getting into the industrial area. The same thing had started to
happen in hot gas filtrationand . . . I saw [that] the real benefit . .. was being able to get a lot of surface into a
smaller filter."-Andrew Jeffrey
3D Partners

"From experience, he knew that the architectural model making industry . . . hasn't changed a lot from exacto knives,
mylar, and foam. It is very time-intensive and takes a lot of crafts experience. By . . . setting up a service bureau to
use 3DPTM, you could get around that problem."-Andrew Kelly.

3D Orthopedics

"As a medical professional I was also aware of the shortcomings of existing surgical techniques. They're using cadaver
bones . . . or they're using pre-formed things that are either plastic or ceramic. The surgeon is literallyhand grinding
a big block of material during surgery. . . . They don't fit well and controlling and restoring normal form and contours
is difficult, if not impossible .... The 3DPTM process would allow you to provide an anatomically accurate form that
fit the defect so that it restored the area to normal contours. This avoids problems that affect patients aesthetically
and even functionally .... There were a few start-up companies involved in laser lithography. This allowed threedimensional forming of some polymer-based materials. This was very limiting because if you are going to make
replacement body parts, you have to be able to use all materials .... One thing that the 3DPTM process did is to
allow you to use the whole world of materials. . . . I was doing a lot of research in ceramics and I have an advanced
degree in materials science. I also do work on replacement teeth and bones. I know that there are certain
microstructures that are conducive to being replaced by bone. Biological applications require that you control the
microstructure and macrostructural aspects, and the 3DPTM process lets you do that .... I thought that the 3DPTM
process would allow us to make a scaffold matrix which would allow for the in growth and replacements with the
patient's own bone ...."-Stephen
Campbell

"I knew that the 3DPTM process could solve this problem and that stereolithography could not because of my technical
background. It was clear from that work that sterolithography could only print in two colors, but the 3DPTM process
could print in many."-Todd Jackson

of the 3DPTM process, Stephen was working on a program
at Brigham and Women's hospital to reconstruct images
from MRIs and CAT scans to construct 3-D models of

bones. His prior education in materials science allowed
him to understand how the 3DPT process would solve
the problem of creating artificial body parts in multiple

<-----Page 18----->SCOTT SHANE

materials;whereas his surgical experience led him to recognize how the 3DPTM process would make surgery to
replace body parts easier and more effective.
Prior knowledge also influenced Lau Christianson (3D
Imaging) and Todd Jackson's (3D Imaging) discovery of
a solution to particularcustomer problems. However, unlike many of the entrepreneurs,Lau and Todd recognized
this solution because of prior knowledge about technology. Todd Jackson knew how to use three-dimensional
printing to make objects out of multiple materials and in
multiple colors because he is pursuing a Ph.D. at MIT,
where he is designing a CAD interface programthat "will
take the image as constructed on the computer and allow
the 3D printerto put different materials next to each other.
This is the equivalent of color printing. You can go ahead
and put multiple materials together or two different colors
together." He explains that the customer problem that 3D
Imaging would solve is exactly the problem that he was
trying to solve in his thesis.
Mike Padnos' (Conferences) solution to a customer
problem also was influenced by his prior knowledge.
However, unlike the other entrepreneurs,who developed
this solution through prior work experience or education,
Mike developed his prior knowledge as a consumer. He
recognized that people go to malls to buy photographs of
themselves and their families so he decided to starta business in which he would make three-dimensional sculptures from photographs.
In contrast, 3D Partners recognized how to use the
3DPTM process to solve a customer problem because of
the founders' prior knowledge as users. 3DP Partners
would solve the problems of speed and cost in architectural model making by allowing less experienced and less
costly employees to produce models in one-tenth of the
time that they currently take. The team recognized the
solution to the customer problem of speed and cost because the architect on the team knew from prior experience how time consuming and skill-intensive the craft of
producing concept models was.

Discussion
Existing explanations for entrepreneurship are incomplete because they do not explain adequately the process
of opportunity discovery, an important part of the entrepreneurshipprocess (Kirzner 1997). This study proposed
that all people are not equally likely to recognize the same
entrepreneurialopportunities which result from technological change. It also proposed the entrepreneurscan and
will discover opportunities through recognition rather
than search. Moreover, it proposed that the prior distri-

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 11, No. 4, July-August

2000

bution of knowledge in society influences who discovers
these opportunities.

Limitations
This article is not without limitations. First, although the
study provides direct evidence that individuals will discover opportunities related to their prior knowledge, it
provides only indirect evidence about the ability of some
people and not others to discover opportunities. Second,
the sample is composed of highly educated people who
might have been trained to discover opportunities. Consequently, the results might not generalize to the overall
population. Third, the respondents provided self-reported
data, based on introspection and retrospection. They
might have rationalized a process that had either favorable or unfavorable outcomes for them. Fourth, the study
examined only entrepreneurs.Therefore, the results might
be subject to selection effects that would not be present
if nonentrepreneurshad been included. Nevertheless, the
strength of the results and their importance to entrepreneurship theory suggests that future researchers consider
the role of prior knowledge in the discovery of opportunity.

Contributionto Research
The results have several importantimplications for entrepreneurshiptheory. Priorresearch makes several assumptions that are inconsistent with the empirical results found
here. Technological change does not generate obvious entrepreneurial opportunities, which allow anyone to discover any given entrepreneurialopportunitywhich results
from that change. Cognitive limits and the specialization
of knowledge preclude entrepreneursfrom identifying the
complete set of entrepreneurialopportunities in a given
technology and comparing between alternatives to select
the best one in which to invest (Aldrich and Zimmer
1986). Moreover, the results show that the process of discovery can be driven by recognition of knowledge already possessed rather than by search for knowledge
needed (Kirzner 1997). Consequently, individuals who
have developed particular knowledge through education
and work experience will be more likely than other people
to discover particularentrepreneurialopportunities in response to a given technological change (Venkataraman
1997).
The results also provide evidence that individual differences influence the discovery of opportunities in a different way than that generally described in the literature.
This study suggests that entrepreneursdiscover opportunities, not because they have special attributes (e.g., unusual perceptive ability) that make them better able to
recognize opportunities(Schumpeter 1934, p. 79; Shackle

465

<-----Page 19----->SCOTT SHANE

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

1982), but because idiosyncratic prior knowledge makes
people better able to discover certain opportunities than
others (Venkatarman 1997, Fiet 1996). This finding is
important for two reasons. First, it provides a role for
individual-level attributesthat may be more likely to generate large, statistically significant, robust, and consistent
differences across samples than do explanations that depend on the superiority of entrepreneurson some dimension.
Second, the results reiterate the importance of individual differences to the entrepreneurshipprocess, and demonstrate that entrepreneurshipcan not be explained solely
by reference to factors external to individuals, like competition or prior firm foundings (e.g., Singh and Lumsden
1990). In fact, the results suggest that individual differences may imprint the development of new organizations
even before they are founded. This is importantbecause
previous research has shown only that new organizations
are programmed during firm infancy not before birth
(Stinchombe 1965).
The findings also have important implications for theories of economic growth. While Rosenberg (1994) and
others have provided numerous historical examples in
which inventors failed to recognize the commercial value
of their inventions, ranging from the telephone to the laser, theories of economic growth typically ignore the
question of opportunity discovery in the process of technological change. These theories generally assume that
the development of new technology leads to an immediate increase in economic output because entrepreneurs
immediately grasp the entrepreneurialopportunities that
result from technological change (Kirzner 1985). This
study shows that before technological change can influence output, an individual must perceive an entrepreneurial opportunity. Because not all entrepreneurs will
perceive the same opportunities, some desirable entrepreneurial opportunities may go unnoticed and unexploited.
Moreover, a small amount of technological change
might generate a large amount of economic output because entrepreneursdiscover a large number of opportunities in which to exploit the technology. Conversely, a
large amount of technological change might generate a
small amount of economic output because it generates
a small number of entrepreneurialopportunities. Furthermore, "at any given point in time output may be less than
is possible and desired, because of opportunitiesthat have
remained unnoticed" (Kirzner 1985, p. 74-75).

Future Directions
This study also suggests several avenues for future research. Scholars could examine how prior knowledge in-

466

fluences opportunity discovery outside of the context of
high technology. For example, would two potential entrepreneurs, one with a restaurant background and the
other with an apparelbackground,look at the same vacant
storefront and see restaurantand clothing store opportunities, respectively? While the results of this study would
suggest an affirmative answer, prior knowledge might interact with the complexity of discovering the opportunity.
Therefore, investigation of how prior knowledge influences the discovery of opportunities across different business settings would be valuable. Possible approaches to
researching this question include field studies of entrepreneurs who rent the same retail space, experimental
studies designed to manipulate the information about opportunities, or longitudinal observation of particularretail
locations.
In addition, the results suggest that future research on
the exploitation of opportunities should control for variation in the attributes of the opportunities that different
entrepreneursdiscover. Previous research has drawn conclusions about the effect of individual differences on the
decision to exploit entrepreneurialopportunity based on
the assumption of a zero correlation between individual
differences and opportunity discovery (Khilstrom and
Laffont 1979, Evans and Jovanovic 1989). Because individual differences influence the discovery of opportunity and the decision to exploit opportunity (Schumpeter
1934, p. 79), this assumption has led to results that overstate the effects of individual differences. The lack of controls for the value of opportunities has led researchers to
falsely attributethe variance belonging to the opportunity
to the individuals. To accurately explain the role of individual differences in the tendency to exploit opportunities, researchers must examine the variance in the individuals net of the variance in the opportunitiesthat they
discover. This could be done several ways. Crosssectional studies could include measures of the attributes
of the entrepreneurialopportunity as control variables in
a regression equation. Alternatively, longitudinal studies
could measure multiple opportunities for the same individual to partial out the portion of the decision influenced
by the opportunity.
Normative Implications
The finding that the discovery of entrepreneurialopportunities depends on prior knowledge has several implications for individuals seeking to become entrepreneurs.
People will be more likely to discover opportunities in
sectors that they know well than in sectors that are "hot,"
because the investment in the information necessary to
recognize opportunities is likely to occur long before a

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 11, No. 4, July-August

2000

<-----Page 20----->SCOTT SHANE

Prior Knowledge and the Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities

particularsector is popular. Therefore, potential entrepreneurs should look to discover opportunities in what they
know rather than in what is popular with other entrepreneurs.
In addition, opportunity evaluation involves a comparison between the discovered opportunity and other alternatives to entrepreneurshipthat the entrepreneur faces,
rather than between the value of the discovered opportunity and other entrepreneurialopportunities that the entrepreneuris unlikely to identify. Consequently, evaluation of opportunity involves comparing opportunities to
one's own opportunity cost and liquidity and uncertainty
premiums, not comparing one's own opportunityto those
of other entrepreneurs.
Furthermore,the effect of prior knowledge on opportunity discovery also creates interesting wrinkles in the
relationship between entrepreneurs and investors. To
raise money, entrepreneurshave to disclose their opportunities to potential investors. If investors are approached
by multiple entrepreneurs who have identified different
opportunities to exploit a given technology, the investors
may learn about the existence of more opportunities than
any given entrepreneurrecognizes. They may choose not
to fund an entrepreneur's opportunity because other entrepreneursproposed better ways to exploit the same technology. This structuraldifference in information suggests
that entrepreneursshould obtain control over the rights to
exploit new technology to improve their probability of
receiving funding. The patent system allows an entrepreneur to prevent future entrepreneurs from exploiting a
given technology even if the future entrepreneurdiscovers a more valuable use for the technology than the first
entrepreneur.
The field evidence provides at least one example of this
process. Subsequent to Walter Flamenbaum's discovery
of the opportunity to use the 3DPTM process to make
drugs, Lau Christianson and Todd Jackson discovered the
opportunity to use the 3DPTM process to make surgical
models. Even if Lau and Todd's opportunity were more
valuable than Walter's, Therics had already obtained
from MIT the rights to all medical applications for the
3DPTM process. Therefore, Therics was protected against
investor preference for Lau and Todd's application for
the 3DPTMprocess.
The results also provide several implications for public
policy. Government policies to promote entrepreneurship
generally provide disproportionate funding to disadvantaged groups to enhance the probability that people in
these groups will become entrepreneurs.However, if the
discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities is dependent
upon prior knowledge, disadvantaged groups might fail

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 11, No. 4, July-August 2000

to become entrepreneurs not because they lack the resources to do so but because they lack the prior knowledge necessary to discover valuable opportunities. Consequently, a public policy solution to lack of
entrepreneurshipamong certain groups may be to invest
in the development of knowledge in these disadvantaged
groups.
In addition, the findings suggest that unrecognized
costs to society are incurred where patent holders grant
world-wide exclusive licenses to their discoveries. By
granting an exclusive license, a patent holder precludes
the possibility that a future entrepreneur will exploit a
more valuable use for the technology than the one proposed by the exclusive licensee. While this cost of exclusive licensing might prove smaller than the benefits that
exclusivity provides, to date public policy has treatedthis
cost as nonexistent. Futureresearch would greatly inform
public policy if it weighed the costs and benefits of worldwide exclusivity to technical discoveries.
Finally, the results show that efforts to centralize opportunity discovery will meet with difficulty. Some researchers have argued that a decentralized economy will
have difficulty in fully exploiting the growth returns of
general purpose technologies. Exploitation by multiple
entrepreneursin different fields creates duplication of effort, reduces the economies of scale and scope from coordination, and creates contracting problems (Bresnahan
and Trajtenberg 1995). However, decentralization has
offsetting advantages in the discovery of opportunities.
Nelson (1987) argues that uncertaintycombined with differences in knowledge among experts makes the efforts
to plan and coordinate the development of new technology ineffective. Central agents, such as university technology licensing officers or government officials will be
unable to identify all of the entrepreneurialopportunities
to exploit a given new technology because they have prior
knowledge about some markets and technical fields, but
not others. Consequently, as Hayek (1945) argued, governments and organizations cannot successfully centralize the process of opportunity exploitation.

Conclusion
This paper showed that differences in prior information
influence who discovers entrepreneurialopportunities to
exploit new technology. This finding generates several
importantimplications for development of theory, public
policy, and the practice of entrepreneurship.Hopefully,
future researchers will use the concepts of limited information and entrepreneurial discovery presented here to
generate a robust explanation for entrepreneurship.
