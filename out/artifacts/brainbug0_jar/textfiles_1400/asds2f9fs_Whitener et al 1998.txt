In many approaches to interpersonal and organizational trust, researchers focus on
employees' perceptions that their managers are trustworthy. We turn the tables,
however, and examine the antecedents of managerial trustworthy behavior and the
challenge of initiating trust. Drawing on agency and social exchange theories, we
present an exchange relationship framework that identifies organizational, relational, and individual factors that encourage or constrain managerial trustworthy
behavior.

Imagine driving into work one day and hearing over the radio that your employer had
agreed to merge with a rival firm and that the
combined company would probably employ at
least 10 percent fewer workers. Ciba Geigy employees experienced this scenario in 1996, when
they were surprised to learn about their company's planned merger with Sandoz.

mental to cooperative relationships (Blau, 1964;
Deutsch, 1958).
In recent reviews scholars have summarized
common elements of the many different definitions of interpersonal trust (Hosmer, 1995; Mayer,
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Drawing on these
reviews and the work of others (Deutsch, 1962;
Gambetta, 1988; Zand, 1972), we use a definition
that reflects three facets. First, trust in another
party reflects an expectation or belief that the
other party will act benevolently. Second, one
cannot control or force the other party to fulfill
this expectation-that
is, trust involves a willingness to be vulnerable and risk that the other
party may not fulfill that expectation. Third,
trust involves some level of dependency on the
other party so that the outcomes of one individual are influenced by the actions of another.
With these components, trust can be viewed
as an attitude held by one individual-the
trustor-toward
another-the
trustee (Robinson,
1996). This attitude is derived from the trustor's
perceptions, beliefs, and attributions about the
trustee, based upon his or her observations of
the trustee's behavior. Not surprisingly, most re-

Good news or bad, employees could trust management to give it to them straight, to mean what

Management has lost credibility, employees are
scared, and organizational trust has hit rock bottom (Caudron, 1996:20).
At the same time that trust in organizations has
hit "rock bottom," researchers have shown that
interpersonal trust has significant relationships
with many organizational variables, such as the
quality of communication (e.g., Muchinsky, 1977;
Roberts & O'Reilly, 1974a,b; Yeager, 1978), performance (Earley, 1986), citizenship behavior
(McAllister, 1995), problem solving (Zand, 1972),
and cooperation (Axelrod, 1984; Deutsch, 1962).

search on the antecedents of trust has focused
on trustor perceptions and beliefs, such as trustors' perceptions of trustees' competence, benevolence, and integrity, that appear to be critical
conditions for trust (Butler, 1991; Mayer et al.,
1995). These insights into trustors' perceptions
help identify how trust arises and suggest that
managers can have considerable
impact on
building trust. Indeed, we will argue that managers' actions and behaviors provide the foundation for trust and that it is actually management's responsibility to take the first step and
initiate trusting relationships. However, little is
known about what causes managers to behave
in a trustworthy manner and, consequently,
what managers can do to build trust.
Our purpose in this article is to analyze the
types of behavior managers may engage in that
build trust, which we label "managerial trustworthy behavior," and to present a framework for understanding the antecedents of this behavior in
organizations. To complement existing research
on trustors' perceptions, we focus on trustees' behavior and the complex motivational context in
which it occurs. By focusing on behavior, we go
beyond factors that merely create the perception
or impression of trust to what supports or constrains actions that promote trust. We use an exchange theory lens to identify and analyze organizational, relational (exchange), and individual
factors that encourage or constrain trustworthy
behavior in organizations. In doing so, we provide
insight into how organizations can create an environment that supports trustworthy behavior. We
also place the concept of interpersonal trust in a
different context: trust is not merely an attitude
held by one party toward another but exists in the
parties' relationship.
The article consists of five sections. We begin
by briefly reviewing agency and social exchange theories and discussing implications for
trust formation. Second, we propose a taxonomy
of five dimensions of trustworthy behavior derived from research on antecedents of trust.
Third, we present our framework representing
the organizational, relational, and individual
antecedents of trustworthy behavior. Fourth, we
delve more deeply into the challenge of trust
initiation and discuss what organizations can
do to support managerial trustworthy behavior.
We conclude the article with a discussion of
implications and avenues for future research
and practice.

THEMANAGER-EMPLOYEE
EXCHANGE
RELATIONSHIP
Many theories of trust are grounded in social
exchange theory (Blau, 1964), which assumes
that trust emerges through the repeated exchange of benefits between two individuals. Because it addresses the process of initiating and
expanding social exchanges, this theory provides a useful lens for examining the motivational mechanisms underlying the initiation of
trustworthy behavior. However, managers and
employees are also involved in an economic
exchange relationship. Theories of economic exchange, like agency theory (Eisenhardt, 1989),
place little emphasis on trust, but they do offer
explanations for managerial behavior, such as
monitoring and control, that are commonplace
in organizations and that affect employees' perceptions of trust. They also capture the economic
context in which social exchange relationships
develop. Therefore, we use both theories to analyze the motivation to engage in trustworthy
behavior.

Agency Theory
Agency theorists describe the structuring of
economic exchange relationships between two
parties (Eisenhardt, 1989; Jensen & Meckling,
1976; Noorderhaven, 1992). A principal-agent relationship exists when one party-the principalcontracts with another party-the agent-to perform a task involving delegation of decision
making in exchange for compensation. Agency
theorists examine how principals and agents
attempt to structure the relationship to protect
their own interests. Applying agency theory to
manager-employee dyads, we can consider the
employee to be an agent and the manager to
represent the interests of the principal.'

' Agency theory typically has been applied to relationships in which the principal is an owner of the firm and the
employees are the agents of the owners. Because managers
are not necessarily owners, they may serve in the role of
agents relative to the owners of the company. Regardless of
their level of ownership, however, managers serve the role
of principal relative to the role of their subordinates in that
they hire or engage the subordinate "to perform some service on their behalf which involves delegating some decision making authority to the agent" (Jensen & Meckling,
1976: 308).

This perspective
assumes
self-interestmeaning that individuals strive to maximize individual utility and that both parties seek to
minimize risks associated with the relationship.
Agents bear risk as a function of how they are
compensated. To the extent that their compensation is based on outcomes that are beyond
their control, the risk to them is greater. In contrast, the principal faces the risk of opportunism
and incompetence on the part of agents. The risk
of opportunism is greater when the principal
lacks information about agents' actions (i.e., information asymmetry) and when competing incentives or goals (i.e., goal incongruence) for
agents motivate them to engage in actions other
than what was contracted by the principal. For
example, when employees are contracted to perform a job that the manager cannot directly observe, the manager faces the risk that the employees may shirk their duty. To minimize
agency risk, principals generally either monitor
agents' behavior to ensure contract compliance
or base agents' compensation on task outcomes
to align the agents' goals with the principals'.
Social Exchange Theory
Although the formal or contractual relationship in employment is economically driven, a
social element to such relationships typically
evolves. Social exchange theory (Blau, 1964)
helps to explain the dynamics of such exchanges. In a social exchange one individual
voluntarily provides a benefit to another, invoking an obligation of the other party to reciprocate by providing some benefit in return. Proving oneself trustworthy may be problematic
when one is initially forming such social exBlau argues, however,
change relationships.
that trust may be generated through two means:
(1) through the regular discharge of obligations
(i.e., by reciprocating for benefits received from
others) and (2) through the gradual expansion of
exchanges over time.
Social exchanges differ from economic ones in
several fundamental ways (Blau, 1964). First, social exchanges may involve extrinsic benefits
with economic value (e.g., information and advice) or intrinsic benefits without any direct objective economic utility (e.g., social support).
Further, extrinsic benefits often are expressions
of support and friendship and, thus, have intrinsic value as well. Therefore, exchanges that

515

have little or unclear economic benefit can have
a strong impact on the social dimension of a
relationship.
Second, whereas benefits in economic exchanges are formal and often contracted explicitly, such benefits are rarely specified a priori or
explicitly negotiated in social exchanges (Blau,
1964). Thus, providing benefits is a voluntary
action.
Finally, because such behavior is voluntary,
there is no guarantee that benefits will be reciprocated or that reciprocation will result in receipt of future benefits. The exchange of benefits
involves
uncertainty,
in early
particularly
stages of the relationship, when the risk of nonreciprocation is relatively high. Consequently,
relationships evolve slowly, starting with the
exchange of relatively low-value benefits and
escalating to higher-value benefits as the parties demonstrate their trustworthiness (Blau,
1964).
Taken together, agency theory and social exchange theory expand the picture of trust formation in organizations. An agency theory lens
highlights the formal economic context and selfinterest motive, as well as the behavioral consequences. It also delineates factors that contribute to the risk of opportunism and identifies
how the exchange relationship can be structured to minimize this risk. Although implying
how relationship context contributes to risk,
agency theory takes a relatively static view of
relationships.
A social exchange theory lens, however, highlights dynamic elements of the exchange relationship. It emphasizes the exchange process,
including its development over time, and indicates that successful social exchanges should
influence perceptions of risk of nonreciprocation
(i.e., opportunism) and trust. This lens also helps
us identify when, under conditions of agency
risk, an individual is likely to trust another
party, rather than impose greater controls. For
example, imagine two managers each working
with a subordinate who telecommutes. From an
agency theory perspective, information asymmetry is high in both cases and, therefore,
agency risk (i.e., risk of opportunism) is high.
However, the manager who forms a strong social bond with his or her subordinate through
the process of successful
social exchanges
should perceive less risk of opportunism, despite equal levels of information asymmetry.

<-----Page 4----->516

Academy of Management Review

In summary, our agency theory lens identifies
relatively static, contextual factors associated
with the risk of opportunism in economic exchanges. It is under these circumstances
of
agency risk that social exchange theory is particularly relevant, for it helps us examine when
one party is willing to trust another rather than
impose control on the other. Specifically, our
social exchange theory lens suggests that, by
habitually discharging one's obligations, trust
develops that may mitigate the risk of opportunism inherent in the organizational
context.
Therefore, managers may reduce the risk of opportunism by engaging in trustworthy behavior.
In the following section we define trustworthy
behavior and describe its dimensions.

DIMENSIONSOF TRUSTWORTHY
BEHAVIOR
Managerial behavior is an important influence on the development of trust in relationships between managers and employees. We
define managerial trustworthy behavior as volitional actions and interactions performed by
managers that are necessary though not sufficient to engender employees' trust in them. This
behavior occurs in a social and economic exchange context, in which managers initiate and
build relationships by engaging in trustworthy
behavior as a means of providing employees
with social rewards. Managers who engage in
this behavior will increase the likelihood that
employees will reciprocate and trust them, providing a necessary, but not sufficient, foundation for employees' "trust-in-supervisors."
Five categories of behavior capture the variety of factors that influence employees' perceptions of managerial trustworthiness:
1. behavioral consistency,
2. behavioral integrity,
3. sharing and delegation of control,
4. communication (e.g., accuracy, explanations, and openness), and
5. demonstration of concern.
These categories are similar to those proposed
by previous researchers (Butler, 1991; Clark &
Payne, 1997). For example, Butler (1991) describes ten conditions that lead individuals to
trust in another person, including consistency,
discreetness,
fairness, integrity, loyalty, and
openness. However, these conditions primarily
reflect qualities attributed to the trustee by the

July

trustor. Because we turn the tables and examine
trustees' behavior, our analysis provides a
unique perspective on the dimensions of trustworthy behavior.

Behavioral Consistency
Behavioral consistency (i.e., reliability or predictability) is an important aspect of trust (Butler, 1991; Gabarro, 1978; Jennings, 1971; JohnsonGeorge & Swap, 1982; Robinson & Rousseau,
1994). As we noted previously, trust reflects the
willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of
another party and the willingness to take risks
(Johnson-George & Swap, 1982; Mayer et al.,
1995). If managers behave consistently over time
and across situations, employees can better predict managers' future behavior, and their confidence in their ability to make such predictions
should increase. More important, employees become willing to take risks in their work or in
their relationship with their manager. Predictable, positive behavior reinforces the level of
trust in the relationship (Graen & Uhl-Bien,
1995).

Behavioral Integrity
Employees observe the consistency between
managers' words and deeds and make attributions about their integrity, honesty, and moral
character. Dasgupta (1988) has identified two behaviors-(1)
telling the truth and (2) keeping
promises-as
key behavioral antecedents to attributions of integrity: attributions that affect
employees' trust in their managers (e.g., Butler,
1991; Gabarro, 1978; Giffin, 1967; Larzelere &
Huston, 1980; Mayer et al., 1995; Ring & Van de
Ven, 1992).
Although behavioral consistency and behavioral integrity have some similarities, they are
distinct dimensions. Both reflect a consistency
that serves to reduce employees' perceived risk
in trusting their managers. However, on the one
hand, behavioral consistency reflects the reliability or predictability of managers' actions,
based on their past actions. Behavioral integrity, on the other hand, refers to the consistency
between what the manager says and what he or
she does.

Sharing and Delegation

Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, and Werner

of Control

Research on trust perceptions has indicated
that sharing control, including participation in
decision making and delegating control, are key
components of trustworthy behavior. Managers
vary in the extent to which they involve employees in decision making. Involvement may range
from having no employee input at all into decito the
sions to full discussion and input-even
point of everyone coming to a consensus
(Driscoll, 1978; Vroom & Yetton, 1973). The extent
to which managers involve employees influences the development of trust. Driscoll (1978),
for example, has found that employees' trust is
higher when they are satisfied with their level of
participation in decisions; it is also higher when
employees can determine their work roles (Deci,
Connell, & Ryan, 1989). Even when control is
limited to the process of decision making, such
as in having the opportunity to voice opinions, it
is positively associated with trust in managers
1987; Folger &
& Ruderman,
(Alexander
Konovsky, 1989; Korsgaard & Roberson, 1995).
Managerial sharing and delegation of control
may promote trust because of the interplay between economic and social factors. When managers involve employees in decision making,
employees have greater control over decisions
that affect them and, therefore, can protect their
own interests. In agency terms this control by
employees reduces the risk of opportunism on
the part of the manager and increases the likelihood of favorable outcomes for the employee.
Even more important to our understanding of
trust, however, is the symbolic value sharing
and delegation of control are likely to have for
employees. When managers share control, they
demonstrate significant trust in and respect for
their employees (Rosen & Jerdee, 1977). Employees value being involved in decision making,
because it affirms their standing and worth in
the organization (Tyler & Lind, 1992). In the language of social exchange theory, sharing and
delegation of control are social rewards, in the
form of approval or respect that the manager
grants to the subordinate. To the extent that this
reward represents an initiation or escalation of
exchange of social benefits between a manager
and employee, the employee's trust in the manager is likely to increase, especially when coupled with enhanced outcomes for the employee.

517

Communication
researchers identify three
Communication
factors that affect perceptions of trustworthiness: (1) accurate information, (2) explanations
for decisions, and (3) openness. In many studies
accuracy in information flow has had the strongest relationship with trust-in-supervisor when
compared with other variables (e.g., desire for
interaction, summarization, gatekeeping, and
overload; Mellinger, 1956; Muchinsky, 1977;
O'Reilly, 1977; O'Reilly & Roberts, 1974, 1977;
Roberts & O'Reilly, 1974a,b, 1979; Yeager, 1978).
Employees see managers as trustworthy when
their communication is accurate and forthcoming. In addition, adequate explanations and
timely feedback on decisions lead to higher levels of trust (Folger & Konovsky, 1989; Konovsky &
Cropanzano, 1991; Sapienza & Korsgaard, 1996).
Evidently, managers who take the time to explain their decisions thoroughly are likely to be
perceived as trustworthy. Finally, open communication, in which managers exchange thoughts
and ideas freely with employees, enhances perceptions of trust (Butler, 1991; Farris, Senner, &
Butterfield, 1973; Gabarro, 1978; Hart, Capps,
Cangemi, & Caillouet, 1986).
The emphasis in communication is on sharing
and exchanging ideas. This dimension is more
limited than the previous dimension that focontrol.
cuses on sharing and relinquishing
However, both dimensions build employees'
trust in their managers.

Demonstration of Concern
Benevolence (Mayer et al., 1995)-demonstrating concern for the welfare of others (McAllister,
1995; Mishra, 1996)-is part of trustworthy behavior and consists of three actions: (1) showing
consideration and sensitivity for employees'
needs and interests, (2) acting in a way that
protects employees' interests, and (3) refraining
from exploiting others for the benefit of one's
own interests. These actions on the part of managers may lead employees to perceive them as
loyal and benevolent. Researchers have shown
such evidence of managerial loyalty to be an
important condition that leads to trust between
mentors and prot6g6s (Butler, 1991; Jennings,
1971).
From the justice literature we know that managers can promote trust by showing concern for

<-----Page 6----->518

Academy of Management Review

employees' needs and interests (Lind, 1997), by
respecting others' rights, and by apologizing for
unpleasant
consequences
(Greenberg, 1993;
Konovsky & Pugh, 1994). Managers demonstrating concern also show that they "do good" for
their employees, apart from any egocentric or
opportunistic motives (Mayer et al., 1995; Mishra,
1996). That is, their behavior connotes a genuine
interest in an employee's welfare and may imply some attachment to the employee.
Finally, this dimension reflects behavioral restraint-that
is, managers who could take advantage of their employees' vulnerability "stay
their hand," choosing not to behave opportunistically (Bromiley & Cummings, 1995). For example, managers could use confidential or personal information about employees
to their
personal or organizational advantage, could
present an employee's innovative idea as their
own, or could engage in other similar "cunning"
(Pettit, 1995) or "dark-side" (Kramer, Brewer, &
Hanna, 1996) behavior that takes advantage of
employees' vulnerability. Employees may not
always observe managerial restraint, for it may
involve the absence of action. However, if they
are aware that their manager refrained from
exploiting them, they are more likely to perceive
their manager as trustworthy.

form of approval extended to the subordinate by
the manager. Social exchange theorists would
imply that the nature of work relationships influences managers' willingness to initiate and
escalate the exchange of such rewards.
These theoretical lenses lay the foundation for
our framework for organizing the antecedents of
managerial trustworthy behavior. As we show
in Figure 1, this framework identifies major sets
of variables at the organizational, relational
and individual level that we believe support or
encourage managerial trustworthy behavior.
We also suggest some general propositions for
future research.

Organizational

Factors

According to R. Hardin (1996), organizations
can be designed to enhance trustworthiness by
creating structures that make trusting successful; however, Hardin falls short in recommending specific structures to accomplish this goal.
From an agency theory perspective, the critical
issue seems to be the extent to which the organization requires high control and close monitoring of employees. Organizational

5. In the network form organizational members share control, recognize their mutual
dependence, and pursue common goals.
On the one end of the continuum, the control
imposed by an entrepreneur constrains the development of trustworthy behavior, and on the
other, the codependence required by network
organizations necessitates the development of
trustworthy behavior. Creed and Miles conclude
that high-control organizations, with a high degree of centralization and formalization and a
primary focus on efficiency, will constrain or
impede the development of trustworthy behavior, such as delegation and open communication. Low-control organizations, however, with

lower formalization,
and a focus on effectiveness, should make managers more likely to delegate decisions and

Human resource policies and procedures.
Creed and Miles (1996) also suggest that the
design of human resource (HR) policies and procedures should affect perceptions
of trust.
Therefore, such HR systems as reward, control,
and performance appraisal practices may facilitate or inhibit managerial trustworthy behavior. Research indicates that the extent to which
performance appraisal procedures follow principles of procedural justice has a positive impact on employees'
trust in their manager
(Folger & Konovsky, 1989; Korsgaard & Roberson,
1995).
Performance evaluation policies, then, may be
one way to encourage such behavior. For example, Taylor, Tracy, Renard, Harrison, and Carroll
(1995) found that when an appraisal system was
modeled on due-process principles, managers
communicated more openly and allowed more
employee participation than did managers following a traditional appraisal process. Thus, by
developing appraisal and reward procedures on
principles of due process, such as adequate notice, fair hearing, and judgment based on evidence (Folger, Konovsky, & Cropanzano, 1992), it
may be possible to stimulate trustworthy behavior. In addition to increasing communication,
the establishment of procedurally fair HR policies should encourage managers to behave consistently toward all subordinates.
Proposition 2: The more an organization's HR policies and procedures incorporate (procedural) justice principles into performance appraisal and
reward systems (e.g., regular and
timely feedback and mechanisms for
employee input into performance appraisal), the more likely it will be that

managerial trustworthy behavior, especially communication and behavioral consistency, will occur.
Organizational culture. Organizational culture is a unit- or organizational-level phenomenon derived from social interactions among
members of the unit or organization (Rousseau,
1990). It consists of "the set of shared, taken-forgranted implicit assumptions
that a group
holds" (Schein, 1996: 236) and influences how the
members of the group understand and respond
to their environment. The "content" of culturethe specific assumptions, norms, and values of
the culture-shapes
members' patterns of behavior (Rousseau, 1990) and creates an environment in which certain behaviors are encouraged
and receive support.
Through social learning processes, culture
may directly influence managerial trustworthy
behavior. Managers observe how their organizations respond to others and learn what behavior is rewarded and punished; moreover, they
experience social rewards when they behave in
a manner that is consistent with cultural values
and norms (O'Reilly & Caldwell, 1985; Thompson
& Luthans, 1990).
Also, culture may indirectly encourage (or discourage) managerial
trustworthy behavior
through the structuring of general patterns of
and decision
communication,
coordination,
making. That is, certain cultural values and
norms, more than others, are likely to engender
managerial trustworthy behavior. Rousseau's
(1990) taxonomy of cultural values and norms
helps us identify values that encourage trustworthy behavior. For example, cultures that
value risk taking (a task-related value) will reward and support managers who take such risks
as sharing or delegating control to a subordinate, regardless of the outcome. Similarly, cultures that share such interpersonal values as
inclusiveness, open communication, and valuing people will reward managers for collaborating, sharing information, explaining decisions,
discussing issues openly, and showing concern.
Hence, cultures that support these behaviors
will also encourage and reward trustworthy behavior.

Relational Factors
Research on leader-member exchange suggests that high-quality exchange relationships
between managers and their subordinates are
characterized by the very types of behavior we
have identified as engendering trust. Specifically, high-quality exchange relationships involve showing mutual respect and concern and
sharing of decision control (Dienesch & Liden,
1986; Liden & Maslyn, 1993). From a social exchange perspective, managers may exhibit such
behavior to provide social rewards to employees
and to elicit various prosocial or pro-organizational benefits from the employee, such as compliance and loyalty (Graen & Scandura, 1987;
Marcus & House, 1973). Managers' motivation to
engage in such behavior is thus related to the
value of the benefits received from the employee
and the costs of engaging in such behavior.
Research on leader-member exchange and related areas, such as social dilemmas, indicates
three exchange factors that influence this costbenefit analysis and, ultimately, its consequences for trustworthy behavior: (1) initial inand (3) costs of
teractions, (2) expectations,
exchanges.
Initial interactions. One of the factors that
contributes to establishing a strong relationship
is managers' impressions of new employees' capabilities, based on the employees' initial refor the job
sponses to the role expectations
(Graen & Scandura, 1987). Based on their impressions, managers then provide "negotiating latitude" to employees who fulfill expectations and
demonstrate their capability (Docker & Steiner,
1990; Graen & Scandura, 1987; Graen & Uhl-Bien,
1995). Negotiating latitude includes two-way
between manager and emcommunication
important dimenployee, and delegation-both
sions of trustworthy behavior. In addition, favorable initial interactions are likely to enhance
the quality of the relationship, which will lead
managers to show concern and respect. These
findings imply that employees' initial role performance will encourage trustworthy behavior.

521

Proposition 4: The more effective an
employee is in initially meeting role
requirements, the greater the likelihood will be that the manager will
engage in trustworthy behavior, particularly sharing control, communicating openly, and showing concern.
Expectations. The tenuous nature of reciprocation in social exchange puts the manager in a
sort of trust dilemma. When a manager initiates
trustworthy behavior, he or she runs the risk of
realizing no return on such overtures. Research
on social dilemmas indicates that expectations
of another party's willingness to cooperate are
positively correlated with an individual's decision to take risks and cooperate with the other
party (Dawes, 1980). This finding implies that a
manager's willingness to initiate or escalate
such exchanges will be predicated on his or her
expectations and beliefs about whether the employee will reciprocate.
Proposition 5: The greater a manager's
expectations are concerning an emto reciprocate,
ployee's willingness
the greater the likelihood will be that
the manager will engage in trustworsharing
thy behavior, particularly
control and communicating openly.
Costs of exchanges. Expectancy theorists (Porter & Lawler, 1968) tell us that both the expectancy that certain actions will lead to certain
outcomes and the valence of those outcomes
influence motivation. In Proposition 5 we examined managers' expectations about reciprocation; here, we examine the valence of outvalence
the negative
comes-specifically,
associated with an employee's failure to reciprocate or costs of exchanges.
The social dilemma paradigm suggests that a
related problem involving the initiation of exchanges is the potential for exploitation (Kramer
et al., 1996). That is, the employee may take
advantage of benefits provided by the manager
without reciprocating. Indeed, managers may
bear substantial cost by extending certain rewards associated with trustworthy behavior if
the employee does not reciprocate. For example,
delegating control of a highly visible project can
have substantial negative repercussions for the
manager if the employee does not reciprocate
with loyalty and compliance, because delega-

<-----Page 10----->522

Academy of Management

tion allows employees greater freedom to behave opportunistically. In contrast, delegation
of minor or less visible tasks poses far fewer
costs if the employee fails to reciprocate.
Proposition 6: The higher the costs associated
with unreciprocated
exchanges, the lower the likelihood will
be that managers will engage in trustworthy behavior, particularly sharing
control.
Individual Factors
As we discussed above, social exchange suggests that managers engage in exchanges of
rewards based, in part, on their expectation of
reciprocation and the perceived cost of nonreciprocation. Although the quality of the interpersonal relationship should factor strongly into
whether managers exchange rewards, characteristics of the manager may also influence
these expectations. We propose that three individual factors-(l)
propensity to trust, (2) selfefficacy, and (3) values-will
influence managers' beliefs and expectations
regarding the
likelihood of successful social exchange and,
hence, their propensity to engage in trustworthy
behavior.
Propensity to trust. Such researchers as Rotter
(1967), Farris et al. (1973), and Mayer et al. (1995)
have argued that some individuals are more
dispositionally trusting than others. In his scale,
for example, Rotter conceptualizes trust as a
trait that is stable over time and across situations. Individuals endorse statements like "Parents usually can be relied upon to keep their
promises," indicating a generalized belief that
others, as well as oneself, exhibit such trustworthy behavior as promise keeping and other indicators of behavioral integrity. In part, this propensity stems from one's expectations about
how others are likely to behave. Managers who
have a high propensity to trust expect their employees to reciprocate. According to our exchange framework, this expectation should influence
their motivation
to engage
in
trustworthy behavior.
Proposition 7: The greater a manager's
propensity or disposition to trust is, the
greater the manager's expectation of
reciprocation will be, and the greater
the likelihood will be that the man-

Review

July

ager will engage in trustworthy behavior, particularly behavioral integrity.
Self-efficacy. In addition to personality characteristics or traits, individual factors also include managers' self-efficacy regarding their
knowledge, skills, and ability (KSA; Gist &
Mitchell, 1992). For example, managers who
have low self-efficacy regarding their ability to
delegate control will find it difficult to use participative management processes. Similarly, individuals who have low self-efficacy in their
conflict management skills may be reluctant to
engage employees in two-way communication.
Mishra (1996) provides examples from the auto
industry, showing how competence or the lack
thereof could undermine one's best attempt at
acting in a trustworthy manner. If managers believed they lacked the basic knowledge, skills,
and ability, their low self-efficacy either hampered their motivation to initiate trust or led to
poor performance and unsuccessful attempts to
establish trusting relationships.
Proposition 8: Managers who lack efficacy regarding their knowledge,
skills, and abilities to perform trustworthy behavior (e.g., delegating control or communicating openly) will be
unlikely to engage in trustworthy behavior.
Values. Managers' values influence their motivation to display trustworthy behavior. Individual values consist of definable goals, varying in importance, that motivate and guide
people's choices, attitudes,
and behaviors
(Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992, 1994). Schwartz
(1992) found, for example, that values cluster
into distinct types that serve different motivational purposes, several of which may provide a
value-based foundation for trustworthy behavior. Most relevant is the distinction between values that reflect "self-transcendence," such as
universalism
and benevolence,
versus "selfenhancement," such as achievement, hedonism,
and power.
Managers with self-transcendent values may
be more likely to engage in trustworthy behavior. More specifically, managers with universalist values (understanding, appreciation, and
protection of the welfare of all people) may be
more likely to demonstrate concern for employ-

<-----Page 11----->1998

Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, and Werner

ees than might be managers with power values
(control or dominance over people). Similarly,
managers who value benevolence (the enhancement of the welfare of others) may be more likely
to keep promises and tell the truth (behave with
integrity) than might be managers who value
hedonism (self-gratification). In sum, the values
held by managers are likely to provide the primary "internal compass" that promotes several
dimensions of trustworthy behavior, including
demonstrating concern, behaving consistently,
and behaving with integrity.
Proposition 9: Managers whose values
will be more
are self-transcendent
likely to engage in trustworthy behavior, such as demonstration of concern and behavioral integrity, than
will those whose values are selfenhancing.

THE CHALLENGE OF TRUST INITIATION
Using agency theory and social exchange theory lenses and prior organizational research, we
have examined key antecedents of managerial
trustworthy behavior. Upon closer examination,
we believe these lenses also highlight unique
challenges to initiating the social exchanges
that ultimately build trust. To establish trust
through the reciprocal exchange of social benefits, someone must make the first move. From
the manager's perspective, initiating involves
engaging in trustworthy behavior preemptively,
perhaps before the subordinate has demonstrated his or her worthiness. Managers may be
reluctant to do so, preferring instead to impose
tight control or to monitor behavior. To reap the
organizational benefits of trust, however, managers must be encouraged to make the first
move. Initiating this process, then, is the challenge to, and arguably the responsibility of,
management.
Our purpose in this section is to discuss three
potential impediments to trust initiation-(1) the
motivational complexity of exchange relationships, (2) social dilemmas and the nature of interdependence, and (3) the role of cultural valto suggest ways of overcoming them.
ues-and
Suggestions come directly from our framework
and, as such, provide implications and extensions of our propositions.

523

Motivational Complexity
As we noted previously, agency theory and
social exchange theory create a complex motivational dynamic for managers. On the one
hand, agency theory highlights managers' motivation to minimize risk exposure-for example,
via the imposition of tight control mechanisms
and close behavioral monitoring (Eisenhardt,
1989). On the other hand, social exchange theory
suggests that if managers want to create relationships built on the voluntary discharge of
reciprocal obligations, this should lead them to
relax control and promote trust.
The juxtaposition of these lenses highlights a
fundamental tension between building a relationship based on trust and reducing the risk of
opportunism that could potentially preempt
trust initiation. As suggested by Proposition 1,
however, judicious design of organizational factors may mitigate this problem and encourage
trust initiation. For example, low-control organizations, with greater decentralization and lower
formalization, shoulder (or at least share) the
risk of opportunism by creating a context that
essentially requires managers to initiate trustworthy behavior, such as delegation of control
and open communication. The organization's
design supports delegation of control and encourages trust initiation.

Social Dilemmas
Social exchange theories contain inherent
conflicts related to trust initiation. For example,
similar to theories of economic exchange, theories of social exchange presume individual selfis, people are motivated to maxiinterest-that
mize their individual rewards (e.g., money,
status, or respect) and minimize their individual
or loss of selfcosts (e.g., embarrassment
esteem). Complicating the situation is the fact
that managers often find themselves in situations where the interdependence of individuals'
outcomes creates a conflict between selfinterest and the collective good.
These situations, called social dilemmas, occur when individuals' outcomes are maximized
as they act in their own self-interest, regardless
of what others do. But their actions actually create negative outcomes for everyone involved.
The classic example of such a dilemma is
G. Hardin's (1968) "The Tragedy of the Com-

<-----Page 12----->524

Academy of Management Review

mons," a study of how individual cow herders'
self-interested behavior (i.e., increasing the size
of one's herd) leads to overgrazing of the public
pasture, which undermines the collective good.
Two types of social dilemmas complicate trust
initiation for managers who find themselves in
these situations: the classic Prisoner's Dilemma
and the Volunteer Dilemma.
In the Prisoner's Dilemma (see Kormorita &
Parks, 1994, and Rapoport & Chammah, 1965)
individuals who cannot communicate with each
other face a conflict between maximizing individual interests, by not trusting each other (i.e.,
defecting), versus maximizing collective welfare, by trusting and cooperating. By initiating a
social exchange and not knowing whether it
will be reciprocated, a manager in this situation
runs the risk of being exploited and ending up
with a "sucker's payoff" (e.g., embarrassment or
poor leadership). Managers often face such dilemmas and exhibit this fear; concerns about
gullibility and embarrassment often underlie
managers' reluctance to trust (Rotter, 1980).
In the Volunteer Dilemma (Diekmann, 1985)
one person must make a sacrifice so that the
entire group benefits. Typically, the cost of selfsacrifice is uncertain or highly negative in the
short term. For example, a manager might be
asked to take a pay cut so that his or her group
will have additional resources to complete a
project-for which the entire group benefits. If
the manager fails to take this first step, the
group, including the manager, will not succeed.
This situation leads to potentially tragic outcomes for organizations wanting to encourage
volunteerism for the collective good; the call to
create a "trusting organization," for example,
may never be fulfilled because of the reluctance
on the part of managers, as well as employees,
to volunteer to initiate the process.
Drawing on our framework, especially Propositions 5 and 6, we see that from a relational
perspective, these dilemmas reflect the nature
of outcome interdependence between individuals (e.g., the payoffs for cooperating or not), the
expectations about others' behavior (e.g., expectation of cooperation), and the costs associated
with unreciprocated exchanges. To mitigate this
situation, our framework suggests that changing the nature of the interdependence will encourage managers in dilemma situations to initiate trust. For example, reward structures could
be changed to foster cooperation by making

July

greater use of equity-, team-, or organizationbased incentives. Such systemic changes would
provide greater alignment between employee
and organizational interests (Wilson, 1995).
As this example points out, such solutions are
often beyond the control of the managersubordinate dyad. Changing the nature of the
outcome interdependence
between managers
and their subordinates is ultimately an issue for
the organization as a whole. Our framework
also suggests that decreasing the perceived cost
associated with unreciprocated exchanges encourages managers to initiate trust.

Cultural Values
The variety of cultural values that exist
around the world influences individual behavior (Brodt & Seybolt, 1997; Hofstede, 1980; Lind,
Tyler, & Huo, 1997) and potentially complicates
managerial trust initiation. Cultural values reflect a social group's shared ways of understanding and behaving. Although reflecting a
group's understanding, we will conceptualize
cultural values at an individual level-that
is,
cultural values as represented in an individual
manager's beliefs and behavior.
Depending on the particular cultural values,
trust initiation may be helped or hindered. For
example, individualistic cultures that emphasize self-interest (e.g., the United States) may
make salient the dilemmas discussed above.
Managers in these cultures face a conflict between managing agency risk (risk of opportunism) and building a trusting relationship. As
suggested by our framework, particularly Proposition 7, these managers will perceive the possibility of unreciprocated trust to be too great
and the costs of unrequited trust to be too high to
justify initiating trust. In contrast, a manager
whose cultural values are less individualistic
and less focused on self-interest (e.g., a Japanese manager) may experience little or no conflict in an identical managerial situation. This
manager's cultural values (and practices) may
reflect a propensity to cooperate, which will encourage him or her to initiate trust and engage
in many trustworthy behaviors (e.g., behavioral
consistency, demonstrating concern, and behavioral integrity).

DISCUSSION
Vulnerability and risk are inherent in exchange relationships in organizations. Managers and employees may face different types of
risks and vulnerabilities, but risk is an issue for
all parties involved in a social or economic exchange. Individuals and organizations can, and
generally do, look for ways to manage these
risks. Managers, in particular, often use monitoring and control mechanisms, as depicted by
agency theory (see Horwitz, 1994, for an example
of electronic monitoring in an organization that
processes donations for charities). Such mechanisms minimize the need to trust employees to
act in organizationally desirable ways (Hosmer,
1995).
However, high levels of performance are less
likely when organizations rely on such "weak"
forms of trust (Barney & Hansen, 1994). Moreover,
mutual dyadic trust may be essential for organizational survival and growth. As Handy recently stated in discussing new organizational
forms, "Trust is the heart of the matter" (1995: 44).
We share Gambetta's (1988) concern, however,
that, even though trust is important, it has appeared nebulous and seemingly intractable for
study. For this reason we draw from diverse
bodies of literature to spell out major dimensions of managerial trustworthy behavior. We
also shift the research focus from the question,
"How can managers influence employees' perceptions of managerial trustworthiness?" to the
question, "What is trustworthy behavior, and
what can organizations do to support such behavior?" This shift from trustors' perceptions to
managerial
behavior is important, because
managers can exert the greatest degree of volitional control over their own actions.
Finally, our exchange relationship framework
of managerial trustworthy behavior embeds the
question of trust in the organizational context;
organizational, relational, and individual factors influence a manager's motivation to exhibit
behavior. Although similar to
trustworthy
leader-member exchange theory (e.g., Graen &
Uhl-Bien, 1995), our framework is distinct in several ways. First, we make trust the primary focus
of our framework, rather than positing trust as
one aspect of leader-member exchange. Second,
we analyze the dynamics of managerial trustworthy behavior using two different exchange
lenses: an economic exchange lens and a social

525

exchange lens. This broader exchange lens
makes it possible to describe more completely
the sets of variables, such as the role of organizational structure and policies that influence
trustworthy behavior. Finally, whereas Graen
and Uhl-Bien (1995) also argue that managers
should initiate exchange relationships,
our
framework provides considerably more detail
and direction concerning why and how this initiation process should take place. Overall, we
believe that our dimensions of trustworthy behavior, as well as the framework we have laid
out, make a unique contribution to our understanding of managerial trustworthy behavior
and advance both theory and practice concerning trust in exchange relationships.

Implications for Research
Our emphasis on managerial behavior serves
to complement the current emphasis in the interpersonal trust literature on trust perceptions.
Employee trust perceptions are clearly crucial
and have been emphasized heavily in recent
research. However, our fear is that an emphasis
on trust perceptions can lead researchers and
managers to focus exclusively on managing impressions of managerial trustworthiness. Such
an emphasis without a genuine display of trustworthy behavior can cultivate a belief that managers merely need to display the appearance of
trustworthiness (Greenberg, 1990) to create trusting relationships. In addition to possible ethical
difficulties, such tactics may be counterproductive, if they are perceived as insincere (Greenberg, 1990), and also may be difficult to sustain
over time.
However, impression management attempts
need not be manipulative or insincere (Goffman,
1959; Liden & Mitchell, 1988). Indeed, a focus on
behavior calls attention to what organizations
can do to initiate and manage trustworthy behavior and to engender and support trusting
and
relationships
that are self-perpetuating
sustainable. In the spirit of our change of focus,
future research is needed regarding our typology of managerial trustworthy behavior, as well
as elements of our framework and propositions
concerning the antecedents of such behavior.
Researchers might also investigate additional
dimensions of trustworthy behavior and possible other factors that affect trust initiation.

<-----Page 14----->526

A second avenue to pursue concerns the robustness of trustworthy behavior, including inabout the boundary conditions
formation
around these behaviors. We have proposed that
trustworthy behavior is necessary but not sufficient to influence employees' perceptions of
trust. Individual factors (e.g., perceived similarity, competence, and propensity to trust) and
situational factors (e.g., task interdependence)
may limit the extent to which managerial trustworthy behavior affects employees' perceptions
of trust.
First, as we depict in Figure 1, two cognitive
processes influence employees' perception of
managerial trustworthiness: (1) perceived similarity and (2) competence. Trust often builds between two people as they are attracted to each
other and perceive that they have similar characteristics (e.g., Creed & Miles, 1996; Giffin, 1967;
Larzelere & Huston, 1980; McAllister, 1995;
Zucker, 1986). In addition, perceived ability
(Cook & Wall, 1980; Mayer et al., 1995; Sitkin &
(Butler,
Roth, 1993) or its corollary-competence
1991; Mishra, 1996)-may be essential elements
of trust. Without the judgments that one's manager possesses the competence or ability to fulfill the managerial role, an employee is unlikely
to develop trust in that manager. Although neither of these judgments automatically engenders trust between managers and employees,
each lays a perceptual foundation that increases the likelihood that employees will react
positively to trustworthy behavior on the part of
the manager.
Second, employee characteristics may also influence reactions to managerial trustworthy behavior. Specifically, employees may observe
their managers' trustworthy behavior but may
be unlikely to trust if they lack a general predisposition to trust others (Luhmann, 1979; Mayer et
al., 1995). That is, the extent to which managers'
trustworthy actions lead to perceptions of trust
may perhaps be moderated by employees' propensity to trust. We argued earlier that managers' predispositions to trust will influence their
behavior; similarly, employees' propensity to
trust may influence their responsiveness
to
managers' trustworthy behavior.
Research is also needed on other contextual
factors that may influence managers' propensity
to engage in trustworthy behavior and employees' reactions to such behavior. For example, the
nature of the task-specifically,
the degree of

Review

interdependence-may
make trust more or less
relevant. Because performance on interdependent tasks requires cooperation, trust may be
critical to performing effectively on such tasks.
Thompson's (1967) conceptualization
of intensive technology, where goods and services flow
between various organizational members, as
well as team settings in which tasks, goals, and
rewards are highly interdependent (Campion,
Medsker, & Higgs, 1993), are good examples. Because there is a greater need to build trust on
interdependent tasks, managers may be willing
to initiate trustworthy behavior. However, dependency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trust (Hosmer, 1995).
Implications for Practice
Our analysis has several practical implications for managers. First, as indicated above, we
provide concrete guidance for managers and
organizations concerning how to "get the ball
rolling."
Second, we identify several ways to overcome
the potentially challenging conflicts and uncertainties in this process. For example, individuals should adopt a sophisticated understanding
of the coupling between their own fate and that
of the collective to reduce the conflict between
short-term individual gain and long-term benefit for the collective. In this way organizations
and individuals develop a "collective trust" that
is conceptually similar to other types of shared
resources (Kramer et al., 1996).
In addition, organizational systems can help
managers overcome the potential barriers to initiating trust. Such systems might include coordinating reward structures between managers
and employees, rewarding managers who initiate trust and employees who reciprocate, requiring certain managers to take the lead, and providing invisible "safety nets" and evidence that
the sucker's payoff is not as economically or
psychologically painful as one might expect.
Organizations also can provide training and
educational opportunities to enable and enhance managerial trustworthy behavior. Training and development opportunities can enhance
managers' competencies, skills, and capabilities, especially in the areas of leadership, participation in decision making, delegation, communication, and fairness. As managers increase
the specific skills associated with trustworthy

<-----Page 15----->1998

527

behavior through training and development opportunities, they are more likely to initiate and
exercise it (Caudron, 1996).
Finally, trustworthy behavior may provide a
source for competitive advantage (Barney &
Hansen, 1994). Evironmental and competitive
toward
pressures are pushing organizations
more fluid or network forms, and there has been
increased attention to process reengineeringthat is, dramatically redesigning the processes
used to achieve organizational objectives. Hammer and Champy (1993), for example, describe
organizations of the future as flat and teamoriented forms, in which workers will perfom
work with the autonomy to
multidimensional
make decisions. These changes will only come
abQut, however, with greater monitoring and
control, increased trust between employees and
management, or some combination of the two.
Given the limits of employee monitoring (Grant,
1992), high levels of mutual trust between managers and employees seem to be critical in order
for reengineering efforts to be successful. Organizations that successfully attain high levels of
managerial trustworthiness should be at a competitive advantge in the marketplace, compared
to those that do not (Barney & Hansen, 1994).
that anticipate
More important, companies
these changes, designing themselves and encouraging their managers to initiate and establish trusting relationships, will be well positioned for the future. The irony here is that trust
is often criticized by managers as a "soft" and
seemingly intractable concept, yet it may a necessary condition for attaining the competitive
advantage associated with strategic and structural innovations.
Conclusion
R. Hardin notes that "the best device for creating trust [may be] to establish and support
trustworthiness"
(1996: 29). We propose that
managers and organizations interested in establishing trust must take the first step. By designing organizations in ways that encourage
managers to initiate trusting relationships, and
by rewarding employees for reciprocating, management can establish a foundation for a trusting organization. In light of theorists' visions of
the future, such designs and management practices stand to enhance organizational effectiveness and viability.
