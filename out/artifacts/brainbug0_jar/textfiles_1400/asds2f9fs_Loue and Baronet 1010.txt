ABSTRACT
The paper presents a model of entrepreneurial competence based on 55 skills or abilities possessed
to varying degrees by entrepreneurs from three different countries, France, Canada and Algeria.
These 55 skills were classified in terms of start-up, management, human resources management,
marketing, finance, and behavioral abilities. To study the entrepreneurs’ competencies, we first
asked a qualitative sample of 29 entrepreneurs which skills relevant to their firm and their
entrepreneurial activities they believed they possessed. A list of 55 skills was generated and sent to
several thousand entrepreneurs. We received completed questionnaires from 402 entrepreneurs.
After a review of the literature on entrepreneurial skills, we present the results from our qualitative
and quantitative samples. We used exploratory factor analysis to determine the major dimensions
of entrepreneurial competence. We feel that our research could be significant in a number of
fields, including education programs and entrepreneurship assistance and incubation programs.
Key words: entrepreneur, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial skills, skills profile

<-----Page 1----->INTRODUCTION
In recent times there has been a renewed interest in entrepreneurial skills research. Over the course
of the last few decades a number of research focused on identifying the skills of the entrepreneur,
going so far as posit a link between the possession and implementation of certain competencies
and the efficiency of the firm. The research presented here, which includes the results of an
international survey of entrepreneurs in three French speaking countries – France, Canada and
Algeria – focuses on the identification of entrepreneurial skills.
After a review of the literature in the first part of the paper, we will outline the objectives and
results of the first phase of our research, which was built around a qualitative methodology for
gathering data. Twenty-nine entrepreneurs were questioned about their competencies and a list of
55 skills was drawn up. We will then move on to present the quantitative results of a study based
on a sample of 402 French, Canadian and Algerian entrepreneurs. Descriptions of the sample, the
research methodology and the results, will be followed by a discussion of the results and of
potential avenues for further research.

LITERATURE REVIEW
For over thirty years, the subject of the skills required to succeed in business has aroused a certain
amount of interest. Much work has been done in this field since the 1980’s. In the early part of that
decade, many researchers concentrated on isolating links between the performance of the firm and
the psychological qualities of its manager. Then, in the mid-1980s, after the relative failure of this
approach, North American scholars began to focus on the skills of the entrepreneur (Hambrick and
Crozier, 1985; Milton, 1989). By identifying those skills, they attempted to explain entrepreneurial
performance by means of what the entrepreneur does, rather than by means of what he or she is
(Gartner, 1988).
In the 1990’s, typological classifications describing entrepreneurial skills were developed by a
number of scholars (Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Herron & Robinson, 1993; Baum, 1995). Based on
a study of 134 owner-directors, Chandler and Jansen (1992) provided a list of skills divided into
three categories: entrepreneurial skills, managerial skills and technical-functional skills; Herron
and Robinson (1993) elaborated a list of seven “abilities” that can be regarded as meta-skills;
while Baum (1995) conducted a study on 363 entrepreneurs and identified a series of skills similar
to those isolated by Chandler and Jansen. Taking their inspiration from Chandler and Jansen,
Lorrain, Belley and Dussault (1998) sent a questionnaire to 300 Canadian entrepreneurs asking
them to comment on their skills. The results generated a list of 39 skills divided into twelve main
areas, including identifying opportunities, strategic vision, business network management, time
management, marketing management, managing operational aspects of the firm, managing
personnel, and business negotiation and decision-making. All these studies contributed to the
emergence of a paradigm which gradually became a central tenet of academic approaches to
entrepreneurship.
In the first decade of the new millennium, many researchers, in other countries and continents, also
attempted to establish links between a firm’s success and the skills and characteristics of its
directors.
In Quebec, Pettersen (2006) carried out a large scale survey, involving 142 entrepreneurs and 677
people in their entourage, of the skills regarded as vital for those considering setting up their own

<-----Page 2----->firm. The survey generated a list of 30 “desirable” skills divided into seven main categories:
strategic and general corporate management, operations management, problem-solving and
decision-making, human resources management, interpersonal relations and influence, and selfmanagement. In the same vein, Cadieux (2007) focused more specifically on entrepreneurial skills
in the context of family succession cases. Her qualitative analysis of a sample of 12 individuals
who had taken over family SMEs in the manufacturing sector in Canada led her to identify six
categories containing a total of 32 skills judged to be essential: strategic and general corporate
management, results-led day-to-day running of the firm, problem-solving and decision-making,
interpersonal relations and influence, self-management, and the management of family relations.
Another current in Quebecois research puts an emphasis on the “behavioral” content of
entrepreneurial skills. For researchers working in this area, the entrepreneur must display certain
specific qualities and implement a particular range of behaviors in order to succeed in business.
There is, in other words, a range of aptitudes, attitudes and qualities which a person must possess
if he or she wants a successful entrepreneurial career. Currently much is said about an
“entrepreneurial culture” instilled from a very young age (nursery school). Other factors possibly
contributing to the constitution of “entrepreneurial foundations” in the cultural sense of the phrase
are also analyzed (Gasse and d’Amours, 1993; Gasse, 2005; Pelletier, 2006; Gasse and Paracini,
2007). Antecedents are said to include family culture and life stories capable of explaining a taste
for entrepreneurship. Motivations cover the deep reasons prompting an individual to act –
achievement, success, challenges, autonomy, power and control, and recognition are central
aspects of this category. Aptitudes are the natural dispositions, abilities and capacities developed
by an individual (self-confidence/enthusiasm, perseverance/determination, tolerance of
ambiguity/stress management, intuition/flair, and creativity/ imagination. Lastly, Attitudes consist
of perceptions of and reactions to various situations, and the kind of judgments they elicit:
attitudes to risk/initiative; fate/chance, money/wealth; success/failure and action/time. The analysis
of these major characteristics serves as a basis for the development of tests evaluating
entrepreneurial potential and for elaborating specific pedagogical approaches frequently employed
in Quebec. The ICE test (a French acronym for “Entrepreneurial Characteristics List” drawn up by
Yvon Gasse) is the best example this type of assessment (http://www.entreprendre.ulaval.ca).
Lastly, in his guide “Invitation à la culture entrepreneuriale” (“Invitation to entrepreneurial
culture”), Pelletier (2006) largely focuses on the characteristics and qualities which supposedly
work in favor of entrepreneurship: self-confidence, motivation, a taste for effort, a sense of
responsibility, initiative, perseverance, solidarity, team spirit, resourcefulness and determination.
Research has also been carried out in this field by French scholars. For example, in describing the
skills of people setting up innovative firms in incubator situations, Charles-Pauvers, SchiebBienfait and Urbain (2004) introduced a tri-partite temporal dimension – the emergence of the
idea, the elaboration of the project, and the launch of the activity. Meanwhile, using an approach
focusing to a greater degree on operational aspects and mindful of the teaching profession,
Laviolette and Loué (2006) reviewed the entrepreneurial skills identified in the French and AngloSaxon literature. They later carried out a qualitative analysis of the entrepreneurial skills of eight
incubators managers (Loué, Laviolette and Bonnafous-Boucher, 2008). This initial research
generated a theoretical profile of both specifically entrepreneurial skills and technical
competencies (general management, HR management, commercial management, marketing and
financial management). Boughattas and Bayad (2008) focused on identifying the competencies of
directors of very small firms in the Lorraine region. Their work, which also emphasizes
operational aspects, involved the development of a self-diagnostic tool for entrepreneurs of such
companies and would-be entrepreneurs keen to form a more precise idea of their own potential.
The authors presented a list of skills sets for directors of very small firms: the capacity to develop

<-----Page 3----->a business start-up project, commercial skills, financial management skills, personnel
management, organizational skills, managing relations, and the ability to manage information
effectively.
In China, a qualitative study was recently conducted on a sample of 19 directors of SMEs in the
service sector with a view to evaluating entrepreneurial skills and behaviors and, at the same time,
comparing with various success factors. The results of the study generated a list of 45 skills and
behaviors divided into six main categories: conceptual skills, organizational skills, strategic skills,
commitment and responsibility, and support skills. An analysis was made of the assumed
relationship between those competencies and the levels of efficiency required for the success of
the firm (Man and Lau, 2000). Similarly, in a more recent qualitative study of a sample of 16
entrepreneurs, the same researchers focused on a comparative analysis of the skills of indigenous
inhabitants and immigrants in Hong Kong (Man, Lau and Chan, 2008). The study produced an
original perspective on the contribution of “external influences” on the ways in which such skills
were employed.
Our research should be viewed as part of this worldwide interest in the subject. This paper
discusses the results of research conducted on entrepreneurs from three countries: France, Canada
and Algeria. The research is divided into two phases. The first part presents a qualitative study of a
sample of 29 entrepreneurs, while the second part – a quantitative study of a sample of 402
entrepreneurs – is the methodological extension of the first.

METHODOLOGY OF THE QUALITATIVE PHASE AND RESULTS
In our previous work in the field, we were able to develop a “theoretical” list of entrepreneurial
skills. This skills profile prompted us to carry out an empirical, comparative analysis. This
qualitative study was carried out in France, Canada and Algeria with a sample of 29 entrepreneurs.

Methodology and Interview Guide
The entrepreneurs selected in each of the three countries were active in various sectors of the
economy, including services, industry, commerce and the new technologies. Only firms founded
over five years previously were retained. In such cases, it seemed to us that the firm had exited its
initial phase of existence and that the entrepreneur in question had become well established. The
29 entrepreneurs in the sample were questioned about the skills that they claimed to have
mastered. We first used a non-directive interview methodology in order to encourage the
respondents to provide a progressive, individual classification of their skills. We asked each of the
entrepreneurs a very general question, namely, “Which major skills sets have you mastered?”
Then we asked, “Can you name skills in each of these sets?” After this initial informationgathering phase, we presented each of the entrepreneurs with a list of the skills sets that we had
isolated in our previous research. While these skills sets provided a framework for the interview,
they in no manner represented ideal answers to the question being asked. This question was as
follows: “Which of the following skills sets do you think that you have mastered: entrepreneurial,
managerial, HR management, commercial and marketing, financial, and behavioral management?”
Respondents were then asked to position skills not previously mentioned within the model

<-----Page 4----->presented to them. Generally speaking, this approach considerably increased the number of skills
mentioned by respondents, thus increasing the value of the results.

Results from qualitative study
We then analyzed the skills mentioned by the respondents within the framework of the six skills
sets areas outlined above. This analysis enabled us to select a body of 55 skills as derived from a
consensus from the interviewees.
We then undertook an initial exploratory examination of the results with a view to comparing the
theoretical skills isolated in our previous work with those obtained in the interviews carried out
with the entrepreneurs. Adjustments were made in consequence: 70% of the theoretical skills were
confirmed and 16 skills were rejected. Similarly, 23 new skills mentioned by the respondents were
added to the final list and all skills mentioned less than two times were discarded on the grounds
that they were insufficiently representative. Lastly, the high degree of correlation between the
skills mentioned by entrepreneurs from three French-speaking, and thus culturally close, countries,
is worthy of mention. The results were largely homogeneous and represented a high degree of
consensus. Finally, the qualitative phase of the study generated a validated list of 55 skills, which
are listed in Table 1.

QUANTITATIVE PHASE: SAMPLE AND METHODOLOGY
For the quantitative phase, we sent the list of 55 skills within a 75-variable questionnaire to a large
sample of entrepreneurs. The other variables covered demographics such as the country of origin,
gender, age and level of education of the respondents and descriptions of the entrepreneur’s firm
such as number of employees, and turnover and the entrepreneur’s level of experience, number of
companies previously set up and number of companies currently managed. Lastly, variables
describing firm performance, such as percentage of export, innovation and growth, were also
added.
In order to examine the entrepreneurs’ mastery of the skills on the list, a 7 point Likert-type scale
was used. Respondents were given the following instruction: “Read the list of skills carefully. On
a scale of 1 through 7, please indicate the degree to which you master these skills, with 1 meaning
that’s not me at all and 7 meaning that’s me absolutely.”
The questionnaire was delivered in a number of different ways. Firstly, by telephone, especially in
Canada; secondly, via the Internet, using “interview” software, social websites, professional
networks, and a website specifically created for the study (http://www.competencesentrepreneuriales.net). Finally, face-to-face interviews were also conducted.

Description of quantitative sample
A total of 456 questionnaires were returned over a seven month period spanning March to
November 2009. Fifty-four questionnaires were rejected due to the firms not having been

<-----Page 5----->established long enough (less than five years). We thus used 402 completed questionnaires: 208
from France, 106 from Canada and 88 from Algeria.
Source of the questionnaires: Of the 402 entrepreneurs, 59 were interviewed by telephone
(14.7%), 140 were questioned via the Internet (34.8%), and 203 were interviewed face-to-face.
Gender of the respondents: 75 of the entrepreneurs were women (18.7%) and 327 were men
(81.3%).
Age of the respondents: 14.4% of the respondents were younger than 35, 65.2% were between the
ages of 35 and 54, and 20.4% were 55 years and older.
Education level: 55.7% of the respondents had undergraduate or graduate university degrees and
the others had high school or technical degrees.
Field of studies: Among university graduates, 46% had business degrees and 27% science or
engineering degrees.
Professional experience: The average work experience for our sample was 22.2 years (median: 20
years). The average experience in the industrial sector where the entrepreneurs work is 15.9 years
(median: 13 years). The average firm age is 11.2 years (median: 9 years).
Number of companies set up before the latest firm: Of the 402 entrepreneurs questioned, 208
(51.7%) had not previously set up a firm. The other respondents had set up at least one other
company.
Number of firm(s): 71.6% of the respondents owned only one firm, while 28.4% ran more than one
company.
Enterprise creation/Succession: 81.3% of the entrepreneurs questioned had set up their own
company. The other respondents had taken the firm over.
Type of ownership: 42.5% of respondents (171) were sole owners; 29.4% (118) owned a family
firm; and 28.1% (113) had one or more business partners.
Industrial sector: Almost half (48.2%) of entrepreneurs work in the service sector, 24.7% in retail,
and 20.5% in the manufacturing sector. Only 6.6% work in the technology sector.
Number of employees / Size of the firm: Firms were divided into four groups according to their
size: very small enterprises with five or fewer employees represent 53% of our sample; small
companies with 6-20 employees form 28.6% of our sample; medium-sized companies with 21-99
employees 12.9% of our sample, and large companies with 100 employees or more the remaining
5.5% of our sample.
Turnover: Most of the respondents generated a turnover of under 500,000 € (64%). Only 21.1% of
the firms in our sample had sales of 1 million or more Euros.
Export: 23% of the entrepreneurs questioned exported.
Average growth rate in the last three years: The average growth rate in our sample over the course
of the last three years was 22.8% (median: 10%).
Percentage of new products: The average percentage of sales due to new products or services
marketed by the firm was 23.6% (median = 10%).
Types of entrepreneur: 41.3% of the entrepreneurs in the sample were novice entrepreneurs, 30.8%
were serial entrepreneurs, and 27.9% were portfolio entrepreneurs.

<-----Page 6----->Statistical analysis
Of the 55 skills in the questionnaire, 47 were “know-how”-type skills, while 8 were behavioral
attributes. Insofar as entrepreneurs’ competence was concerned, the average response, on a scale
of 1-7, was between 4.25 and 5.75 for the 47 “know-how” skills. The average for the eight
behavioral attributes was slightly higher ranging from 5.21 to 6.03.
In order to examine the underlying structure among the 55 variables representing entrepreneurial
skills and behaviors or attributes, we first conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the 47 skill
variables and then of the 8 behavior or attribute variables. Exploratory factor analysis is a useful
technique since it reduces a large number of variables to a smaller, more manageable, number of
factors emerging from the data.
We used a principal components analysis with eigenvalues larger than 1 to find factors. We also
used a varimax rotation in order to simplify the actual factors existing in our data and to examine
them in relation to our qualitative findings. We saw earlier that the qualitative interviews revealed
a set of skills possessed by entrepreneurs and theoretically classified as start-up skills, managerial
skills, human resource management skills, commercial and marketing skills, financial management
skills, and behavioral skills.
With a sample 402 respondents, analyzing 47 variables gives us a ratio of 8.55 observations per
variable, more than the required ratio of 5 observations per variable prescribed by Hair et al., 2010
(p. 102).

Results
Table 3 presents the factor loadings for all 47 skills variables in the 7-factor solution from the
exploratory factor analysis. Hair et al. (2010) recommend for a sample of 350 or more a minimum
factor loading of .300. We used a more stringent minimum loading of .400. All loadings from our
analysis are above this minimum requirement. In fact, only four variables have factor loadings
below .500.
However, five variables have cross-loadings on two factors after rotation. Thus, the variable
“developing a training plan” loads significantly both on the Human resource management factor
and the Marketing – monitoring activities factor. The variable “writing contracts” also loads
significantly on these two factors. The variable “organizing work” loads significantly on the
Planning and organizing factor and the Marketing - commercial activities factor. Finally, the
variables “selling” and “developing a sales strategy” load both significantly on the Marketing –
commercial activities and Marketing – monitoring activities factors. In addition, one variable,
“attracting investors”, had communality less than .500 at .486.
Since this was an exploratory research and the variables with cross-loadings have communalities
above .500 (from .551 to .673) and those cross-loadings can be accounted for in organizational
reality, we decided to keep those variables with cross-loadings or with lower than .500
communality for the present study. In addition, the KMO measure at .940 and the Bartlett test of
sphericity were excellent and appear to provide us with a solid model of entrepreneurial skills.
We named the first factor Opportunity recognition and exploitation skills as the variables revolve
around those two sequential activities: first recognizing opportunities and sensing the market and
then creating partnerships, developing a business model, creating strategic vision, starting up a
venture, innovating, attracting investors, and formalizing a business plan. Two other variables also

<-----Page 7----->loaded on this first factor: leadership and finding good managerial talent which can be considered
as following recognizing and exploiting an opportunity. This first factor accounts for 36.3% of the
variance.
The second factor revolves around Human resources management skills and accounts for 6.7% of
the variance. Evaluation activities, such as evaluating employees’ skills, potential and
performance, are the first variables in the factor. They are followed by other HRM activities:
defining job descriptions, establishing compensation, developing a training plan, laying-off people,
interviewing, and writing contracts.
We labeled the third factor Financial management skills which accounts for 5.6% of the variance.
It includes skills in understanding financial results, managing cash and billings, identifying
financial needs, calculating costs, filling-up tax reports, and using ratios.
The fourth factor is Planning and organizing skills and accounts for 4.6% of the variance. It
includes skills such as listening, motivating, arousing support, delegating, instilling team spirit,
planning activities, following up on production, and organizing work.
The Marketing – commercial activities skills is our fifth factor and accounts for 4.4% of the
variance. Activities such as creating customer loyalty, managing the firm’s image, negotiating,
adapting products, building a sales argument, selling, and developing strategy are part of this
factor.
Factor 6 involves other marketing activities such as managing a sales team, doing market research,
and monitoring competition. We labeled this factor Marketing – monitoring activities skills. It
accounts for 3.6% of the variance.
Finally, the seventh factor was labeled Team management skills. It accounts for 2.2% of the
variance and is made up of two variables: managing teams and managing conflicts.
This factor solution seems to have good validity potential. In addition to its KMO measure and
Bartlett test of sphericity, all summated scales created from the variables in each factor have very
good Cronbach alphas (from .779 to .904) and thus show good reliability.
Table 2 presents the factor loadings for all 8 behavioral attribute variables in the 2-factor solution
from the exploratory factor analysis.
The first factor labeled “Vision and intuition” accounts for 50.6% of the variance. Variables such
as visionary, intuitive, open-minded, and working under pressure are part of this factor.
We labeled the second factor «Self-discipline» which accounts for 12.9% of the variance. It
includes attributes such as meticulous, rigorous, persevering, and creative.
The Cronbach alphas from the summated scales are also very good at .832 and .807 respectively
for the two factors.

Discussion
The model of entrepreneurial competence developed qualitatively and quantitatively by our
research presents a good skills profile for entrepreneurs. It was confirmed theoretically from the
literature on entrepreneurial skills and from the in-depth interviews with a qualitative sample of 29
entrepreneurs. In addition, an exploratory factor analysis of answers given by a relatively large
sample of 402 entrepreneurs from three countries seems to confirm even further our model.

<-----Page 8----->Indeed, the six domains revealed in the literature and in the qualitative interviews (Table 1)
correspond in greater details to the nine factors from our two factor analyses (Tables 2 and 3).
However, such an exploratory model requires further research to refine the model and make it
more useful for researchers and teachers of entrepreneurship. First, we need to understand what
creates entrepreneurial competence as defined by our skills profile. For example, what is the
impact of education, work and industry experience, entrepreneurial experience, etc. on the skills
profile? Second, understanding the kind of impact such a skills profile can have on firm
performance, profitability, growth, innovation, etc. also needs to be explored.
Our model was explored with a sample of French-speaking entrepreneurs from three countries.
Further research should explore if it can be corroborated in other cultural environments. It is
possible that different economic or cultural environments have an impact on how entrepreneurial
competence is defined.
Preliminary exploration of our data shows that logistic regression analyses run with the nine
summated scales (from the nine factors) as independent variables on export and firm growth show
that only the factor Opportunity recognition and exploitation skills have a positive significant
impact of these two dependent variables. A similar analysis on the dependent variable innovation
shows that only factors Opportunity recognition and exploitation skills and Vision and intuition
have a positive significant impact.
We are confident that the model of entrepreneurial competence we proposed will be confirmed
more and more in further researches and that it will prove useful to researchers, teachers and
entrepreneurs as well.
