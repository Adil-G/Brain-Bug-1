INTRODUCTION

THIS PAPER SUGGESTSmethods for evaluating investment performance. The

topic is not new. Important work has been done by Sharpe [21, 22], Treynor
[23], and Jensen [13, 14]. This past work has been concerned with measuring
performance in two dimensions, return and risk. That is, how do the returns
on the portfolios examined compare with the returns on other "naively
selected" portfolios with similar levels of risk?
This paper suggests somewhat finer breakdowns of performance. For example, methods are presented for distinguishingthe part of an observed return
that is due to ability to pick the best securities of a given level of risk
("selectivity") from the part that is due to predictions of general market price
movements ("timing"). The paper also suggests methods for measuring the
effects of foregone diversification when an investment manager decides to
concentrate his holdings in what he thinks are a few "winners."
Finally, most of the available work concentrates on single period evaluation
schemes. Since almost all of the relevant theoretical material can be presented
in this context, much of the analysis here is likewise concerned with the oneperiod case. Eventually, however, a multiperiod model that allows evaluations
both on a period-by-periodand on a cumulative basis is presented.
II.

FOUNDATIONS

The basic notion underlying the methods of performance evaluation to
be presented here is that the returns on managed portfolios can be judged
relative to those of "naively selected" portfolios with similar levels of risk.
For purposes of exposition, the definitions of a "naively selected" portfolio
and of "risk" are obtained from the two-parametermarket equilibrium model
of Sharpe [20], Lintner [15, 16], Mossin [18] and Fama [10, 11]. But it is
-wellto note that the two-parametermodel just provides a convenient and somewhat familiar set of naively selected or "benchmark"portfolios against which

the investment performance of managed portfolios can be evaluated. As indicated later, other risk-returnmodels could be used to obtain benchmark portfolios consistent with the same general methods of performance evaluation.
In the simplest one-period version of the two-parametermodel, the capital
market is assumed to be perfect-that is, there are no transactions costs or
taxes, and all available information is freely available to everybody-and
investors are assumed to be risk averse expected utility maximizerswho believe
that return distributions for all portfolios are normal. Risk aversion and
normally distributed portfolio returns imply that the expected utility maximizing portfolio for any given investor is mean-standarddeviation efficient.'
In addition, investors are assumed to have the same views about distributions
of one-periodreturns on all portfolios (an assumption usually called "homogeneous expectations"), and there is assumed to be a riskless asset f, with both
borrowingand lending available to all investors at a riskless rate of interest Rf.
It is then possible to show that in a market equilibrium all efficient portfolios are just combinations of the riskless asset f and one portfolio of risky
assets m, where m, called the "market portfolio," contains every asset in the
market, each weighted by the ratio of its total market value to the total market
value of all assets. That is, if Rm, E(Rm) and O(Rm.) are the one-period return,

expected return, and standard deviation of return for the market portfolio
m, and if x is the proportion of investment funds put into the riskless asset f,
then all efficient portfolios are formed according to2
Rx =xRf + (1 - x)Rm

x

1,

(1)

so that
E(Rx) = xRf + (1 - x)E(Rm)

(2)

c(Rx) = (1 - x)a(Rm).

(3)

Geometrically, the situation is somewhat as shown in Figure 1. The curve
b m d represents the boundary of the set of portfolios that only include risky
assets. But efficient portfolios are along the line from Rf through m. Points
below m (that is, x > 0) involve lending some funds at the riskless rate Rf
and putting the remainderin m, while points above m (that is, x < 0) involve
borrowing at the riskless rate with both the borrowed funds and the initial
investment funds put into m.

on the market portfolio m. In the two-parametermodel a(R.) is a measure of
the total risk in the return on the market portfolio m. Since the only risky
assets held by an investor are "shares"of m, it would seem that, from a portfolio viewpoint, the risk of an asset should be measured by its contribution to
(Y(Rm). In fact this contribution is just cov(Rj,Rm)/a(Ri,n). Specifically, if

In this light (4) is a relationship between expected return and risk which says
that the expected return on asset j is the riskless rate of interest Rf plus a risk
premium that is [E(Rnm)- Rf]/a(Rm), called the market price-per unit of
risk, times the risk of asset j, cov(Rj,m)/a(R"m.).
Equation (4) provides the relationship between expected return and risk
for portfolios as well as for individual assets. That is, if xj, is the proportion

But (4) and (6) are expected return-risk relations derived under the assumption that investors all have free access to available information and all
have the same views of distributions of returns on all portfolios. In short, the
market setting envisaged is a rather extreme version of the "efficientmarkets"
model in which prices at any time "fully reflect" available information. (See,
for example [7].) But in the real world a portfolio manager may feel that he
has access to special information or he may disagree with the evaluations of
available information that are implicit in market prices. In this case the
"homogeneous expectations" model underlying (4) provides "benchmarks"
for judging the manager's ability to make better evaluations than the market.
The benchmark or naively selected portfolios are just the combinations of
the riskless asset f and the market portfolio m obtained with different values
of x in (1). Given the ex post or realized return Rm for the market portfolio,
for the naively selected portfolios, ex post return is just

That is, for the benchmark portfolios risk and standard deviation of return
are equal. And the result is quite intuitive: In the homogeneous expectations
model these portfolios comnprisethe efficient set, and for efficient portfolios
risk and return dispersion are equivalent.
For the naively selected portfolios, (7) and (8) imply the following relationship between risk 1, and ex post return Rx:

(ex postmarketline).

(9)

That is, for the naively selected portfolios there is a linear relationshipbetween
risk and return that is of precisely the same form as (4) except that the expected returns that appear in (4) are replaced by realized returns in (9).
In the performance evaluation models to be presented, (9) provides the
benchmarks against which the returns on "managed" portfolios are judged.
These "benchmarks"are used in a sequence of successively inore complex suggested performanceevaluation settings. First we are concerned with one-period
models in which a portfolio is chosen by an investor at the beginning of the

period, its performanceis evaluated at the end of the period, and there are no
intermediate cash flows or portfolio decisions. Then we consider multiperiod
evaluation models that also allow for fund flows and portfolio decisions between evaluation dates. We find, though, that almost all of the important
theoretical concepts in performance evaluation can be treated in a one-period
context.
ISSUES
SOMEEMPIRICAL
PORTFOLIOS:
III. THE BENCHMARK
Before introducing the evaluation models, however, it is well to discuss some
of the empirical issues concerning the so-called "market lines" (4) and (9).
Since this paper is primarily theoretical, and since empirical problems are best
solved in the context of actual applications, the discussion of empirical issues
will be brief.
First of all, to use (9) as a benchmark for evaluating ex post portfolio returns requires estimates of the risk, P and dispersion, a(Rp), of the managed
portfolios as well as an estimate of a (R1), the dispersion of the return on the
market portfolio. If performance evaluation is to be objective, it must be
possible to obtain reliable estimates of these parameters from historical data.
Fortunately, Blume's evidence [3, 4, 5] suggests that at least for portfolios of
ten or more securities, Phiand ca(Rp) seem to be fairly stationary over long
periods of time (e.g., ten years), and likewise for

o(R1km).

But other empiricalevidence is less supportive.Thus throughoutthe analysis
here normal return distributions are assumed, though the data of Fama [6],
Blume [3], Roll [19] and others suggest that actual return distributions conform more closely to non-normaltwo-parameterstable distributions. It would
conceptually be a simple matter to allow for such distributions in the evaluation models (cf. Fama [11]). But since the goal here is just to suggest some
new approaches to performance evaluation, for simplicity attention will be
restricted to the normal model.
Finally, the available empirical evidence (e.g., Friend and Blume [12],
Miller and Scholes [17], and Black, Jensen and Scholes [2]) indicates that
the average returns over time on securities and portfolios deviate systematically
from the predictions of (4). Though the observed average return-risk relationships seem to be linear, the tradeoff of risk for return (the price of risk)
is in general less than would be predicted from (4) or (9). In short, the evidence suggests that (4) and (9) do not provide the best benchmarks for the
average return-risk tradeoffs available in the market from naively selected
portfolios.
Even these results do little damage to the performance evaluation models.
They indicate that other benchmark portfolios than those that lead to (9)
might be more appropriate, but given such alternative "naively selected"
portfolios, the analysis could proceed in exactly the manner to be suggested.
For example, Black, Jensen and Scholes [2] compute the risks (13's)for each
security on the New York Stock Exchange, rank these, and then form ten
portfolios, the first comprising the .iN securities with the highest risks and
the last comprising the .iN securities with the lowest risks, where N is the

<-----Page 6----->The Journal of Finance

556

total number of securities. They find that over various subperiods from
1931-65 the average monthly returns among these portfolios are highly correlated, and when plotted against risk the average returns on these portfolios
lie along a straight line with slope somewhat less than would be implied by the
"price of risk" in (4) or (9). As benchmarks for performance evaluation
models, their empirical risk-returnlines seem to be natural alternatives to (9).
And with these alternative benchmarks,performance evaluation could proceed
precisely as suggested here. But again, for simplicity, we continue on with the
more familiar benchmarksgiven by (9).
It would be misleading, however, to leave the impression that all important
empirical problems relevant in the application of performance evaluation
models have been solved. To a large extent the practical value of such models
depends on the empirical validity of the model of market equilibrium-that is,
the expected return-risk relationship-from which the benchmark or "naively
selected" portfolios are derived. And though much interesting work is in
progress, it would be rash to claim that all empirical issues concerning models
of market equilibriumhave been settled.
For example, an important (and unsolved) empirical issue in models of
market equilibriumis the time interval or "market horizon period" over which
the hypothetical expected return-risk relationship is presumed to hold. Does
the model hold continuously (instant by instant), or is the market horizon
period some discrete time interval? This is an important issue from the viewpoint of performanceevaluation since if the market horizon period is discrete,
evaluation periods should be chosen to coincide with horizon periods.
The evidence of Friend and Blume [12] and that of Black, Jensen, and
Scholes [2] suggests that meaningful relationships between average returns
and risk can be obtained from monthly data, while the evidence of Miller and
Scholes [17] indicates that this is not true for annual periods. Within these
broad bounds, however, the sensitivity of risk-return relations to the time
interval chosen remains an open issue.
But unsolved empirical questions are hardly a cause for disheartenment.It
is reasonable to expect that some of the empirical issues will be solved in the
process of applying the theory. And in any case, application of a theory invariably involves some empirical approximations. The available evidence on
performance evaluation, especially Jensen's [13, 14], suggests that the required approximations need not prevent even more complicated evaluation
models from yielding useful results.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN A ONE-PERIOD MODEL
WHEN THERE ARE No INTRAPERIOD FUND FLOWS

Let Vat and Vat+i be the total market values at t and t + 1 of the actual
(a = actual) portfolio chosen by an investment manager at t. With all portfolio activity occurring at t and t + 1, that is, assuming that there are no
intraperiod fund flows, the one-period percentage return on the portfolio is
Ra -Vat+

Vat

Vat

<-----Page 7----->Componentsof InvestmentPerformance

One benchmark against which the return Ra on the chosen portfolio can be
compared is provided by Rx(Pfa), which by definition is the return on the
combination of the riskless asset f and the market portfolio m that has risk P,.
equal to (ia, the risk of the chosen portfolio a. One measure of the performance
of the chosen portfolio a is then
(10)

Selectivity = Ra - Rx(Pa).

That is, Selectivity measures how well the chosen portfolio did relative to a
naively selected portfolio with the same level of risk.
Selectivity, or some slight variant thereof, is the sole measure of performance
in the work of Sharpe [21, 22], Treynor [23] and Jensen [13, 14]. But more
detailed breakdowns of performanceare possible. Thus consider
Overall
Performance
[RaRf]

Selectivity

= [Ra-Rx(f(a)1

Risk
+ [Rx((a)-Rf].

(11)

That is, the Overall Performance of the portfolio decision is the difference
between the return on the chosen portfolio and the return on the riskless
asset. The Overall Performance is in turn split into two parts, Selectivity (as
above) and Risk. The latter measures the return from the decision to take on
positive amounts of risk.4 It will be determined by the level of risk chosen
(the value of Pa) and, from (9), by the difference between the return on the
market portfolio, Rm,and the return on the riskless asset, Rf.
These performance measures are illustrated in Figure 2. The curly bracket
along the vertical axis shows OverallPerformancewhich in this case is positive.
The breakdownof performancegiven by (11) can be found along the vertical
line from p,,. In this example, Selectivity is positive: A portfolio was chosen
that produced a higher return than the corresponding "naively selected"
portfolio along the market line with the same level of risk. Risk is also positive,
as it is whenever a positive amount of risk is taken and the return on the
market portfolio turns out to be higher than the riskless rate.
A. Selectivity: A Closer Look
If the portfolio chosen represents the investor's total assets, in the meanvariance model the risk of the portfolio to him is measured by a (Rak),the
standard deviation of its return. And the risk of the portfolio to the investor,
a(Ra), will be greater than what might now be called its "market risk," f,a, as
long as the portfolio's return is less than perfectly correlated with the return
on the market portfolio. To see this, note that the correlation coefficient kam
between Ra and Rm is
4. For greaterdescriptiveaccuracy,we should, of course,say "returnfrom risk" or even "return
from bearing risk," rather than just Risk. Likewise, "return from selectivity," would be more
descriptivethan Selectivity. But (hopefully) the shorter names save space without much loss of
clarity.

[91 and the empiricalwork of Black, Jensen and Scholes [2] suggests that the return on any
well-diversifiedportfoliowill be very highly correlatedwith Rnm.

<-----Page 9----->559

that of the actual portfolio chosen. Thus Diversification measures the extra
portfolio return that the manager's winners have to produce in order to make
concentration of resources in them worthwhile. If Net Selectivity is not positive, the manager has taken on diversifiable risk that his winners have not
compensatedfor in terms of extra return.
Note that, as defined in (12), Diversification is always non-negative, so that
Net Selectivity is equal to or less than Selectivity. When R11> R5, Diversification measures the additional return that would just compensate the investor
for the diversifiable dispersion (that is, a(Ra)

-

Pa) taken on by the manager.

When R,1 < Rf (so that the market line is downwardsloping), Diversification
measures the lost return from taking on diversifiable dispersion rather than
choosing the naively selected portfolio with market risk and standard deviation
both equal to Pa,the market risk of the portfolio actually chosen.
The performance measures of (12) are illustrated in Figure 2 along the
dashed vertical line from (Ra). In the example shown, Selectivity is positive
but Net Selectivity is negative. Though the manager chose a portfolio that
outperformedthe naively selected portfolio with the same level of market risk,
his Selectivity was not sufficient to make up for the avoidable risk taken, so
that Net Selectivity was negative.
The breakdown of Selectivity given by (12) is the only one that is considered here. The rest of Section IV is concerned with successively closer
examinations of the other ingredient of Overall Performance, Risk. Before
moving on, though, we should note that (12) itself is only relevant when diversification is a goal of the investor. And this is the case only when the
portfolio being evaluated constitutes the investor's entire holdings, and the
investor is risk averse. For example, an investor might allocate his funds to
many managers,encouragingeach only to try to pick winners, with the investor
himself carrying out whatever diversification he desires on personal account.
In this case Selectivity is the relevant measure of the managers' performance,
and the breakdownof Selectivity of (12) is of no concern.
B. Risk: A Closer Look
If the investor has a target risk level PT for his portfolio, the part of
Overall Performance due to Risk can be allocated to the investor and to the
portfolio manager as follows:
Manager'sRisk

Risk
[Rx(Pa)-

Investor'sRisk
A-5

A

A

RfI

[Rx(pa)

RX(PT)] + [RX(PT)

-

Rf]

(13)

RX(PT)is the return on the naively selected portfolio with the target level of
market risk. Thus Manager's Risk is that part of Overall Performance and of
Risk that is due to the manager'sdecision to take on a level of risk Padifferent
from the investor's target level PT, while Investor's Risk is that part of Overall
Performance that results from the fact that the investor's target level of risk
is positive. These performance measures are illustrated in Figure 2 along the
dashed vertical line from PT.

<-----Page 10----->560

Manager'sRisk might in part result from a timing decision. That is, in part
at least the manager might have chosen a portfolio with a level of risk higher
or lower than the target level because he felt risky portfolios in general would
do abnormally well or abnormally poorly during the period under consideration. But if an estimate of E(Rm.) is available, a more precise measure of the
results of such a timing decision can be obtained, Specifically, making use of
the ex ante market line of (4)7 we can subdivide Risk as follows:
Risk
[Rx(pa)

= {[Rx(pa)- E(Rx(Pa))] [RX(PT)- E(RX(T))]}
TotalTiming

MarketConditions

+ [E(Rx(pa)) -E(Rx(PT))]

+ [Rx(PT) -Rf].

Manager'sExp.Risk

(14)

Investor'sRisk

The first three terms here sum to the Manager's Risk of (13). Manager's
Expected Risk is the incrementalexpected return from the managers decision
to take on a nontarget level of risk. Market Conditions is the difference between the return on the naively selected portfolio with the target level of risk
and the expected return of this portfolio. It answers the question: By how
much did the market deviate from expectations at the target level of risk?
Total Timing is the difference between the ex post return on the naively
selected portfolio with risk (3nand the ex ante expected return. It is positive
when Rm> E(Rm) (and then more positive the larger the value of Ps), and it
is negative when R.1 < E(R1.) (and then more negative the larger the value
of PIn).The differencebetween Total Timing and Market Conditions is Manager's Timing: it measuresthe excess of Total Timing over timing performance
that could have been generated by choosing the naively selected portfolio with
the target level of risk. Manager's Timing is only positive when the sign of
the difference between Paand P( is the same as the sign of the difference
between R1m.
and E(Rn1), that is, when the chosen level of market risk is above
6. E(,11) might be estimatedfrom past averagereturnson the marketportfolio m. Alternatively,
past data might be used to estimate the average differencebetween Rm and Rf. In any case, it
should becomeclearthat the expectedvaluesused must be naive or mechanicalestimates(or at least
somehow external to those being evaluated), otherwise the value of the timing measures is
destroyed.
Admittedly,given the currentstatus of empiricalwork on the behaviorthrough time of average
returnson risky assets,we can at most sepeculateabout the best way to estimateE(Rm). Hopefully
empiricalwork now in progresswill give more meaningfulguidelines.And perhapsthe development
of theoreticalmethods of performanceevaluation will itself stimulate better empiricalwork on
estimation procedures.In any case, the discussionin the text should help to emphasizethat one
cannot obtain precise measures of returns from timing decisions without mechanical or naive
estimatesof equilibriumexpectedreturns.

(below) the target level and Rl.Jis above (below) E (nR,). It is thus somewhat
more sensitive than Total Timing as a measure of the results of a timing
decision.
A target level of risk will not always be relevant in evaluating a manager's
performance. For example, an investor may allocate his funds to many managers, with the intention that each concentrates on selectivity and/or timing,
with the investor using borrowing or lending on personal account to attain his
desired level of market risk.
If a target level of risk is not relevant but the expected value or ex ante
market line is still available, a breakdown of Risk similar to (14) can be obtained by treating the market portfolio (or the appropriate proxy)8 as the
target portfolio. That is,

The idea here is that even in the absence of a target level of risk, the measure
of Manager's Timing must be standardized for the deviation of the market
return from the expected market return, that is, for the "average" spread
between the ex post and ex ante market lines.
Finally, the goal of this paper is mainly to suggest some ways in which
available theoretical and empirical results on portfolio and asset pricing models
can provide the basis of useful procedures for performance evaluation. But
the various breakdowns of performance suggested above are hardly unique..
Indeed any breakdown chosen should be tailored to the situation at hand. For
example, if a target level of risk is relevant but the subdivision of Risk given
by (14) is regarded as too complicated, then the approximate effects of the
timing decision might still be separated out as follows:

(16)

The one new term here is Investor's Expected Risk, which measures the expected contribution to Overall Performance of the investor's decision to have
a positive target level of risk. Alternatively if a target level of risk is not
8. For example,if one were faced with portfolio evaluationin a multiperiodcontext, one might
use the averageof past levels of market risk chosen by the manageras a proxy for the target risk
level when the latter is not explicitlyavailable.

FLOWS

In the one-period evaluation model presented above, (i) the time at which
performance is evaluated is assumed to correspond to the portfolio horizon
date, that is, the time when portfolio funds are withdrawn for consumption;
and (ii) there are assumed to be no portfolio transactions or inflows and outflows of funds between the initial investment and withdrawal dates, so that
there is no reinvestment problem. If in a multiperiod context we are likewise
willing to assume that: (i) though there are many of them, evaluation dates
nevertheless correspond to the dates when some funds are withdrawn for consumption, and (ii) all reinvestment decisions and other portfolio transactions
are also made at these same points in time, then generalization of the oneperiod model to the multiperiod case is straightforward.9Indeed the basic
procedure could be period-by-periodapplication of the performance measures
presented in the one-period model. The major embellishmentswould not be in
the nature of new theory, but rather would arise from the fact that multiperiod
performancehistories allow statistically more reliable estimates of the various
one-periodperformancemeasures.
But this pure case is unlikely to be met in any real world application. Often
performance evaluation would be carried out by someone with little or no
knowledge of the dates when funds are needed for consumption by the owner
of the portfolio, and often (e.g., in the case of a mutual fund or a pension
fund) the portfolio is owned by many different investors with different consumption dates. As a result evaluation dates, withdrawal dates, and reinvestment dates do not usually coincide.
The rest of this paper is concerned with how the concepts of the one-period
model must be adjusted to deal with such intraevaluation period (or more
simply, intraperiod) fund flows. The procedure is to first present detailed
definitions of variables of interest in models involving intraperiod fund flows,
and then to talk about actual measures of performance.And it is well to keep
in mind that though the analysis is carried out in a multiperiod context, the
problems to be dealt with arise from intraperiod fund flows. With such fund
flows, the same problems would arise in a one-period evaluation model.
A. Definitions
Suppose the investment performance of a portfolio is to be evaluated at
discrete points in time, but that there can be cash flows between evaluation

case see [8].

dates. That is, there can be intraperiod inflows in the form of either cash
receipts (dividends, interest) on existing portfolio holdings or net new contributions of capital by new or existing owners. And there can be intraperiod
outflows in the form of dividend payments to the portfolio's owner(s) (e.g., a
mutual fund declares dividends) or withdrawals of capital (e.g., by a mutual
fund's shareholders).
In simplest terms, the major problem with intraperiod cash flows is obtaining a measure of the return on the beginning of period market value of a
portfolio that abstracts from the effects of intraperiod new contributions and
withdrawals on the end of period value of the portfolio. One approach is what
might be called the mutual fund method. Specifically, when performance
evaluation is first contemplated,the market value of the portfolio is subdivided
into "shares." Subsequently, whenever there are contributions of new capital
or withdrawals of capital from the portfolio, the current market value of a
share is computed and the number of shares outstanding is adjusted to reflect
the effects of the cash flow.10
Thus let evaluation dates correspond to integer values of t and define
V'a,t = actual market value of the portfolio at time t. It thus includes the
effects of investment of new capital or reinvestment of any cash income received on securities held in the portfolio, and it is net of
any dividends paid out to owners or other withdrawals of funds prior
to t.
market value the portfolio would have had at t if no dividends were
Va,t
paid out to owners since the previous evaluation date. In computing
Va,t it is simply assumed that dividends paid to the portfolio's owners
were instead reinvested in the entire portfolio. At the beginning of
each evaluation period, however, Va,t is set equal to V',,t.
nt= number of shares outstanding in the portfolio at t. As indicated
above, this is adjusted when new capital comes into the portfolio
and when capital is withdrawn, but it is unaffected by reinvestment
of cash income received on securities held or by dividends paid to
the portfolio's owners.

P'a,t
Pa,t= Va,t/nt = value of a share at t under the assumption that dividends
paid to owners of the portfolio were instead reinvested in the entire
portfolio.
Ra,t= (Pa,t- Pa,t_-)/pa,t_-. Assuming t corresponds to an evaluation
date, this is the one-period return on a share with reinvestment of
all dividends paid on a share since the last evaluation date.
Ra,t is an unambiguous measure of the return from t - 1 to t on a dollar
invested in the portfolio at t - 1. This is not to say, however, that it is unaffected by intraperiod fund flows. Such fund flows are usually associated with
redistributions of portfolio holdings across securities and these affect the
10. This is in fact the method of accountingused by open end mutual funds. It is also closely
related to the "time-weightedrate of return"approachdevelopedby Professor LawrenceFisher.
On this point see [1, AppendixI and p. 2181.

returnon a share. Moreover, Rat as defined above is not the only unambiguous
measure of the return from t - 1 to t on funds invested in the portfolio at
t - 1. For example, one could define Rat = (P'a,t + dt - P'a,t-i)/P'a,t-1,
where dt is the dividend per share paid during the evaluation period to the
portfolio's owners. The more complicated definition, that is, with dividends
assumed to be reinvested, is '(purer" (especially for the purpose of interportfolio comparisons of performance) in the sense that funds invested at the
beginning of a period remain invested for the entire period, but it is less pure
in the sense that it assumes a reinvestment policy not actually followed in the
portfolio.
The next step is to define prices per share for the benchmark or naively
selected portfolios that also take account of intraperiod fund flows.
Pxt(PT) = price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio with the
target risk level. To avoid double-counting of past performance,
at the beginning of any evaluation period (for example, just after
an evaluation takes place at t - 1) this price is set equal to the
price per share of the actual portfolio. Then this amount is invested in the naively selected portfolio with the target risk level,
and the behavior of the market value of this portfolio during the
evaluation period determines the end-of-period price per share,
Pxt(PT). Any intraperiod cash income generated by the securities
of this naively selected portfolio is assumed to be reinvested in
this portfolio.
These conventions for the treatment of beginning-of-periodvalues and intraperiod cash income will be taken to apply in the definitionsof all the benchmark
portfolios. Thus
pt(Rf) =price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio obtained by
investing all funds available at t - 1 in the riskless asset.
The benchmarks provided by Pxt(PT)and pt(Rf) are unaffected by intraperiod fund flows in the actual portfolio. This is not true of the following
two benchmarks.
Pxt(Pa) = price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio with
market risk equal to that of the actual portfolio. At the
beginning of any evaluation period and after any transaction
in the actual portfolio during an evaluation period (that is,
after any cash flow or exchange of shares in the actual portfolio) the market risk of the actual portfolio is measured,and
the current price per share of this benchmark is shifted into
the naively selected portfolio with that level of market risk.
Thus the value of 15acould be shifting more or less continuously through time as a result of inflows and outflows of
funds and decisions to shift the holdings in the portfolio.'

=price at t per share of the naively selected portfolio with return dispersion equal to that of the actual portfolio. The
definition of Pxt('(R,)) is obtained by substituting O(Ra) for
Pa,in the definition of P.;t(Pa)above.
Thus p.t(f3) and pt(o(A)) take account of changes in P.,,and o(ia) that
result from intraperiodfund flows and portfolio shifts. Computationally,keeping tract of P(3n
and o(Ra) in the way required for these benchmarks is not a
difficult problem. At any point in time the market risk (3nof the chosen portfolio is just the weighted average of the market risks of the individual assets
in the portfolio, where the weights are the proportionsof total portfolio market
value representedby each asset. Thus if one has estimates of the market risks
of the assets from which portfolios are chosen, the value of P,,is updated by
combining these with current measures of the weights of individual assets in
the chosen portfolio. And a similar procedure can be followed with respect to
updating values of a (Rp) 12
Pxt(O(Ra))

B. Multiperiod Measures of Performance
Given the beginning and end-of-periodprices per share for these benchmark
portfolios, their one-period returns are obtained in the usual way. Then the
performance history of a portfolio can be built up (for example) through
period-by-periodapplication of the breakdowns given by (11)- (13). Alternatively, one can define performancemeasures in terms of profit per share rather
than return. Thus, in line with (13) and using end of evaluation period prices,
define

Pxt((a)]

(18)

This type of breakdown can of course be computed both period-by-periodand
cumulatively. And from such multiperiod histories one can get more reliable
measures of a portfolio manager's true abilities than can be obtained from a
one-period analysis. For example, one can determine whether his Selectivity
is systematically positive or simply randomly positive in some periods.
For some purposes one may wish to compare the multiperiod performance
histories of different portfolios. For example, an investment company may
be interested in the relative abilities of its different security analysts and
portfolio managers. Or an investor who has allocated his funds to more than
one managermay be interested in comparingtheir performances.On a periodby-period basis such performance comparisons can be carried out in terms of
percentage returns. Alternatively, if the prices of shares in different portfolios

the so-called "marketmodel." On this, and for additional computationalsuggestions,see Blume

The Journal of Finance

are set equal at the beginning of comparisonperiods, profit-basedperformance
measures such as (18) could be computed both on a period-by-period basis
and cumulatively.
One must not get the impression, however, that all the problems caused by
intraperiodfund flows have been solved. Though the performanceof a "share"
during any given evaluation period (or across many periods) gives an unambiguous picture of the investment history of funds invested in a given
portfolio at a given point in time, comparisons of the performances of shares
in different portfolios are not completely unambiguous.This is due to the fact
that even when things are done on a per share basis, intraperiod fund flows
necessitate portfolio decisions that usually have some effect on the performance
of a share. And when such fund flows occur at different times (and thus
during different market conditions) in different portfolios, the observed performances of shares in the portfolios may differ, even if the portfolios are
managed by the same person trying to follow the same policies in all of his
portfolio decisions. But though such ambiguities seem unavoidable and to
some extent unsolvable, their effects on performance comparisons should be
minor except in cases where portfolios experience large cash flows (relative to
their total market values) in short periods of time and/or when evaluation
periods are long.
Finally, if an ex ante market line is available to compute expected values
through time for the three benchmarks,pxt(P5), Pxt(Pa) and p.t(O(Ra)), then
the one-period performance breakdowns of (14)-(17) can be carried out
either in terms of returns or market values, and these can be used as the basis
of even more detailed multiperiodperformancehistories.
But we terminate the discussion at this point. We do this not because of a
lack of additional interesting problems, but because in the absence of actual
applications, suggested solutions become increasingly speculative and thus of
less likely usefulness.
VI. SUMMARY

Some rather detailed methods for evaluating portfolio performance have
been suggested, and some of the more important problems that would arise in
implementing these methods have also been discussed. In general terms, we
have suggested that the return on a portfolio can be subdivided into two parts:
the return from security selection (Selectivity) and the return from bearing
risk (Risk). Various finer subdivisions of both Selectivity and Risk have also
been presented.
To a large extent the suggested models can be viewed as attempts to combine concepts from modern theories of portfolio selection and capital market
equilibrium with more traditional concepts of what constitutes good portfolio
management.
For example, the return from Selectivity is defined as the difference between the return on the managedportfolio and the return on a naively selected
portfolio with the same level of market risk. Both the measure of risk and the
definition of a naively selected portfolio are obtained from modern capital
market theory, but the goal of the performance measure itself is just to test
how good the portfolio manager is at security analysis. That is, does he show

<-----Page 17----->Components of Investment Performance

any ability to uncover information about individual securities that is not
already implicit in their prices?
Likewise, traditional discussions of portfolio management distinguish between security analysis and market analysis, the latter being prediction of
general market price movements rather than just prediction of the special
factors in the returns on individual securities. The various timing measures
suggested in this paper provide estimates of the returns obtained from such
attempts to predict the market. And modern capital market theory again
plays a critical role in defining these estimates.
