WHEN BUREAUCRATS MEET ENTREPRENEURS:
THE DESIGN OF EFFECTIVE 'PUBLIC VENTURE
CAPITAL' PROGRAMMES*
Josh Lerner
Recently public efforts to finance small high-technology firms have proliferated. We review the
motivations for these efforts and make some preliminary observations about their design. We
explore the underlying challenges that the financing of young growth firms poses, the ways that
specialised financial intermediaries address them, and the rationales for public efforts to finance these companies. The final section makes a set of observations about the ways in which
the structure of these efforts can most effectively complement private sector activity.A frequent
fault in programme design is the presumption that technological criteria can be divorced from
business considerations when evaluating firms.

The federal government has played an active role in financing new firms, particularly in high-technology industries, since the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite. In recent years, European and Asian nations and many US states have
adopted similar initiatives. While these programmes' precise structures have differed, the efforts have been predicated on two shared assumptions: (i) that the
private sector provides insufficient capital to new firms, and (ii) that the government either can identify investments which will ultimately yield high social and/or
private returns or can encourage financial intermediaries to do so. In contrast to
other government interventions designed to boost economic growth, such as privatisation programmes, these claims have received little scrutiny by economists.
The neglect of these questions is unfortunate. While the sums of money involved
are modest relative to public expenditures on defence procurement or retiree
benefits, these programmes are very substantial when compared to contemporaneous private investments in new firms. Government programmes in this arena
have been divided between those efforts that directly fund entrepreneurial firms
and those that encourage or subsidise the development of outside investors. In this
paper, I will focus on 'public venture capital' initiatives: programmes that make
equity or equity-like investments in young firms, or encourage other intermediaries to make such investments. In some such programmes, such as the Advanced
Technology Program and the Small Business Innovation Research programmes
discussed below, the funds are provided as a contract or outright grant.
While these efforts have proliferated, a consensus as to how to structure these
programmes remains elusive. While the design of regulatory agencies has been
extensively studied from a theoretical and empirical perspective, little work has

been done as to how to structure these programmes to insure their greatest
effectiveness and to avoid political distortions. As we discuss below, a number of
these programmes appear predicated on a premise that is at odds with what we
know about the financing process: that technologies in entrepreneurial firms can
be evaluated in the absence of the consideration of the business prospects of the
firm.'

This article will provide an overview of the motivations for these public efforts, as
well as a brief consideration of design questions. In Section 1, the underlying
challenges that the financing of young growth firms poses are discussed, as well as
the ways that specialised financial intermediaries address them. The rationales for
public programmes are explored in Section 2. Section 3 concludes the paper and
raises a set of issues about the design of these efforts.

1. Venture Capitalists and the Financing Challenge
The initial reaction of a financial economist to the argument that the government
needs to invest in growth firms is likely to be scepticism. A lengthy literature has
highlighted the role of financial intermediaries in alleviating moral hazard and
information asymmetries. Young high-technology firms are often characterised by
considerable uncertainty and informational asymmetries, which permit opportunistic behaviour by entrepreneurs. Why one would want to encourage public
officials instead of specialised financial intermediaries (venture capital organisations) as a source of capital in this setting is not immediately obvious.
1.1. The Challengeof Financing YoungHigh-Technology
Firms
To review the types of conflicts that can emerge in these settings briefly, Jensen
and Meckling (1976) demonstrate that agency conflicts between managers and
investors can affect the willingness of both debt and equity holders to provide
capital. If the firm raises equity from outside investors, the manager has an incentive to engage in wasteful expenditures (eg, lavish offices) because he does not
bear their entire cost. Similarly, if the firm raises debt, the manager may increase
risk to undesirable levels. Because providers of capital recognise these problems,
outside investors demand a higher rate of return than would be the case if the
funds were internally generated.
Even if the manager is motivated to maximise shareholder value, informational
asymmetries may make raising external capital more expensive or even preclude it
entirely. Myers and Majluf (1984) and Greenwald et al. (1984) demonstrate that
equity offerings of firms may be associated with a (Akerlof, 1970) 'lemons' problem. If the manager is better informed about the investment opportunities of their
firms than the investors and acts in the interest of current shareholders, then the
manager issues new shares only when the company's stock is overvalued. Indeed,
1 Several limitations-necessitated by the limited available space-should be acknowledged up-front.
First, I will focus on the experience of the United States. Second, I will focus on government efforts to
finance young firms directly, rather than on those that subsidise venture capital organisations, as has
been done in the Israeli Yozma programme or the BioRegio effort in Germany.

numerous studies have documented that stock prices decline upon the announcement of equity issues, largely because of the negative signal sent to the
market.
These information problems have also been shown to exist in debt markets.
Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) show that if banks find it difficult to discriminate among
companies, raising interest rates can have perverse selection effects. In particular,
the high interest rates discourage all but the highest-risk borrowers, so the quality
of the loan pool declines markedly. To address this problem, banks may restrict
the amount of lending rather than increasing interest rates.
These problems in the debt and equity markets are a consequence of the information gaps between the entrepreneurs and investors. If the information
asymmetries could be eliminated, financing constraints would disappear. Financial
economists argue that specialised financial intermediaries can address these
problems. By intensively scrutinising firms before providing capital and then
monitoring them afterwards, they can alleviate some of the information gaps and
reduce capital constraints.
1.2. Responsesby VentureCapitalists
The financial intermediary that specialises in funding young high-technology firms
is the venture capital organisation. The first modern venture capital firm, American Research and Development (ARD), was formed in 1946 by MIT President Karl
Compton, Harvard Business School Professor Georges F. Doriot, and local business leaders. A small group of venture capitalists made high-risk investments in
emerging companies that were formed to commercialise technology developed for
World War II. The success of the investments ranged widely: almost half of ARD's
profits during its 26-year existence as an independent entity came from its $70,000
investment in Digital Equipment Company (DEC) in 1957, which grew in value to
$355 million. Because institutional investors were reluctant to invest, ARD was
structured as a publicly traded closed-end fund and marketed mostly to individuals
(Liles, 1977). The few other venture organisations begun in the decade after
ARD's formation were also structured as closed-end funds.
The first venture capital limited partnership, Draper, Gaither, and Anderson,
was formed in 1958. Imitators soon followed, but limited partnerships accounted
for a minority of the venture pool during the 1960s and 1970s. Most venture
organisations raised money either through closed-end funds or small business
investment companies (SBICs), federally guaranteed risk capital pools that proliferated during the 1960s. While investor demand for SBICs in the late 1960s and
early 1970s was strong, incentive problems ultimately led to the collapse of the
sector.2 The annual flow of money into venture capital during its first three decades never exceeded a few hundred million dollars and usually was substantially
less.
2
In particular, many SBICs made investments in ineffective or corrupt firms. Observers noted that
SBIC managers' incentives to screen or monitor portfolio firms was greatly reduced by the presence of
government guarantees that limited their exposures to unsuccessful investments.

The activityin the venture industry increased dramatically in late 1970s and early
1980s. Industry observers attributed much of the shift to the US Department of
Labor's clarification of ERISA's 'prudent man' rule in 1979: prior to that year, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) limited pension funds from
investing substantial amounts of money in venture capital or other high-risk asset
classes.
The subsequent years saw both very good and trying times for venture capitalists. On the one hand, venture capitalists have backed during the 1980s and
1990s many of the most successful high-technology companies, including Apple
Computer, Cisco Systems, Genentech, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems. A substantial number of service firms (including Staples, Starbucks, and TCBY) have
also received venture financing. At the same time, commitments to the venture
capital industry were very uneven. The annual flow of money into venture funds
increased by a factor of ten during the early 1980s, peaking at over six billion
2000 dollars. From 1987 to 1991, however, fund-raising steadily declined. Over
the past decade, the pattern has been reversed. 2000 represented a record fundraising year, in which nearly $70 billion was raised by venture capitalists. This
process of rapid growth and decline has created a great deal of instability in the
industry.
To address the information problems that preclude other investors in small
high-technology firms, the partners at venture capital organisations employ a variety of mechanisms. First, business plans are intensively scrutinised: of those firms
that submit business plans to venture capital organisations, historically only 1% has
been funded (Fenn et al., 1995).
In evaluating a high-technology company, the venture capitalists employ several
criteria. To be sure, the promise of the firm's technology is important. But this
evaluation is inexorably linked with the evaluation of the firm's management.
Venture capitalists are well aware that many promising technologies do not ultimately fill market needs. As a result, most place the greatest emphasis on the
experience and flexibility of the management team and the size of the potential
market. Even if the market does not evolve as predicted, with a sophisticated team
the firm may be able to find an attractive opportunity. The decision to invest is
frequently made conditional on the identification of a syndication partner who
agrees that this is an attractive investment (Lerner, 1994). In exchange for their
capital, the venture capital investors demand preferred stock with numerous
restrictive covenants and representation on the board of directors.
Once the decision to invest is made, the venture capitalists frequently disburse
funds in stages. Managers of these venture-backed firms are forced to return repeatedly to their financiers for additional capital in order to ensure that the money
is not squandered on unprofitable projects. In addition, venture capitalists intensively monitor managers, often contacting firms on a daily basis and holding
monthly board meetings during which extensive reviews of every aspect of the firm
are conducted. (Various aspects of the oversight role played by venture capitalists
are documented in Gompers and Lerner (1999b).)
It is important to note that, even with these many mechanisms, the most likely
primary outcome of a venture-backed investment is failure, or at best modest

success. Gompers (1995) documents that out of a sample of 794 venture capital
investments made over three decades, only 22.5% ultimately succeeded in going
public, the avenue through which venture capitalists typically exit their successful
investments. (A Venture Economics study (1988) finds that a $1 investment in a
firm that goes public provides an average cash return to venture capitalists of $1.95
in excess of the initial investment, with an average holding period of 4.2 years. The
next best alternative, a similar investment in an acquired firm, yields a cash return
of only 40 cents over a 3.7-year mean holding period.) Similar results emerge from
Huntsman and Hoban's (1980) analysis of the returns from 110 investments by
three venture capital organisations. About one in six investments was a complete
loss, while 45% were either losses or simply broke even. The elimination of the topperforming 9% of the investments was sufficient to turn a 19% gross rate of return
into a negative return.
In short, the environment in which venture organisations operate is extremely
difficult. Difficult conditions that have frequently deterred or defeated traditional
investors such as banks can be addressed by the mechanisms that are bundled with
the venture capitalists' funds. These tools have led to venture capital organisations
emerging as the dominant form of equity financing for privately held technologyintensive businesses.3

2. Rationales for Public Programmes
At the same time, there are reasons to believe that despite the presence of venture
capital funds, there still might be a role for public venture capital programmes. In
this section, I assess these claims. I highlight two arguments: that public venture
capital programmes may play an important role by certifying firms to outside
investors, and that these programmes may encourage technological spillovers.
2.1. The CertificationHypothesis
A growing body of empirical research suggests that new firms, especially technology-intensive ones, may receive insufficient capital to fund all positive net present
value projects due to the information problems discussed in the previous section.4
If public venture capital awards could certify that firms are of high quality, these
information problems could be overcome and investors could confidently invest in
these firms.
As discussed above, venture capitalists specialise in financing these types of
firms. They address these information problems through a variety of mechanisms.
Many of the studies that document capital-raising problems examine firms during
3 While evidence regarding the financing of these firms is imprecise, Freear and Wetzel's (1990)
survey suggests that venture capital accounts for about two-thirds of the external equity financing raised
by privately held technology-intensive businesses from private-sector sources.
4 The literature on capital constraints (reviewed in Hubbard (1998)) documents that an inability to
obtain external financing limits many forms of business investment. Particularly relevant are works by
Hall (1992), Hao and Jaffe (1993), and Himmelberg and Petersen (1994). These show that capital
constraints appear to limit research-and-development expenditures, especially in smaller firms, though
the limits may be less binding as those on capital expenditure.

JOURNAL

[FEBRUARY

the 1970s and early 1980s, when the venture capital pool was relatively modest in
size. Since the pool of venture capital funds has grown dramatically in recent years
(Gompers and Lerner, 1998), even if small high-technology firms had numerous
value-creating projects that they could not finance in the past, one might argue
that it is not clear this problem remains today.
A response to this argument emphasises the limitations of the venture capital
industry. Venture capitalists back only a tiny fraction of the technology-oriented
businesses begun each year. In 2000, a record year for venture disbursements, just
over 2,200 US companies received venture financing for the first time. Yet the
Small Business Administration estimates that in recent years about 1 million new
businesses have started up annually. Furthermore, private venture funds have
concentrated on a few industries: for instance, in 2000, fully 46% of the funding
went to internet-related companies. More generally, 92% of the funding went to
firms specialising in information technology and healthcare. Thus, many promising firms in other industries are not attracting venture capitalists' notice, perhaps
reflecting 'herding' by venture capitalists into particular areas, a problem that
finance theory suggests affects institutional investors (Devenow and Welch, 1996).
If government programmes can identify and support these neglected firms, they
might provide the 'stamp of approval' these high potential, underfunded firms
need to succeed.
But if government officials are going to address these problems, they will need to
be able overcome the many information asymmetries and identify the most
promising firms. Otherwise, as De Meza (2001) argues, these efforts are likely to be
counter-productive. Is it reasonable to assume that government officials can
overcome these problems while private sector financiers cannot? Certainly, this
possibility is not implausible. For instance, specialists at the National Institute of
Health or Department of Defense may have considerable insight into which biotechnology or advanced materials companies are the most promising, while the
traditional financial statement analysis undertaken by bankers would be of little
value. In general, the certification hypothesis suggests that these signals provided
by government awards are likely to be particularly valuable in technology-intensive
industries where traditional financial measures are of little use.
2.2. ThePresenceof R&D Spillovers
A second rationale emerges from the literature on R&D spillovers. Public finance
theory emphasises that subsidies are an appropriate response in the case of activities that generate positive externalities. Such investments as R&D expenditures
and pollution control equipment purchases may have positive spillovers that help
other firms or society as a whole. Because the firms making the investments are
unlikely to capture all the benefits, public subsidies may be appropriate.
An extensive literature (reviewed in Griliches (1992) and Jaffe (1996)) has
documented the presence of R&D spillovers. These spillovers take several forms.
For instance, the rents associated with innovations may accrue to competitors
who rapidly introduce imitations, developers of complementary products, or to
the consumers of these products. Whatever the mechanism of the spillover,
(? Royal Economic Society 2002

<-----Page 7----->2002]

WHEN

MEET ENTREPRENEURS

F79

however, the consequence is the same: the firm invests below the social optimum
in R&D.
After reviewing a wide variety of studies, Griliches estimates that the gap between
the private and social rate of return is substantial: the gap is probably equal to
between 50% and 100% of the private rate of return. While few studies have
examined how these gaps vary with firm characteristics, a number of case-based
analyses (Jewkes, 1958; Mansfield, et al., 1977) suggest that spillover problems are
particularly severe among small firms. These organisations may be particularly
unlikely to effectively defend their intellectual property positions or to extract
most of the rents in the product market.
2.3. Limitationsof 'PublicVentureCapital'Programmes
Even if spillover problems are substantial or government officials can successfully
identify promising small firms, these efforts may not solve these financing problems. An extensive political economy and public finance literature has emphasised
the distortions that may result from government subsidies as particular interest
groups or politicians seek to direct subsidies in a manner that benefits themselves.
As articulated by Olson (1965) and Stigler (1971), and formally modelled in works
such as Peltzman (1976) and Becker (1983), the theory of regulatory capture
suggests that direct and indirect subsidies will be captured by parties whose joint
political activity such as lobbying is not too difficult to arrange (ie, when 'freeriding' by coalition members is not too large a problem).
These distortions may manifest themselves in several ways. One possibility
(discussed, for instance, in Eisinger (1988)), is that firms may seek transfer payments that directly increase their profits. Politicians may acquiesce in such
transfers in the case of companies that are politically connected. A more subtle
distortion is discussed by Cohen and Noll (1991) and Wallsten (2000): officials
may seek to select firms based on their likely success, and fund them regardless of
whether the government funds are needed. In this case, they can claim credit for
the firms' ultimate success even if the marginal contribution of the public funds
was very low.
The presence of these distortions is likely to vary with programme design. In
particular, one of the reasons that has been suggested for why the SBIR programme is relatively effective (as documented in Lerner (1999)) is that the decision makers are highly dispersed. In particular, the federal programme managers
are scattered across many sub-agencies, and are responsible for many other tasks as
well. Thus, the costs of identifying and influencing these decision makers is high.
In programmes where a central group makes highly visible awards, the dangers of
political distortions are likely to be higher.

3. The Challenge of Programme Design
An immense literature in regulatory economics and industrial organisation has
considered the structure of regulatory bodies. The different ways in which regulators can monitor and shape industry behaviour - and Congress can in turn

THE ECONOMIC

monitor the regulators - has been explored in detail. (For an overview, see Laffont
and Tirole (1993).)
Other areas of interactions between government officials and firms, however,
have been much less well scrutinised. Not only is the theoretical foundation much
less well developed, but the empirical literature is at a much earlier stage. (Klette
et al. (2000) provide an overview of the current state of empirical research.) Thus,
our observations must be necessarily tentative in nature.
My colleague Paul Gompers and I recently (1999a) looked at the design of
efforts to assist high-technology entrepreneurs in one programme, the Advanced
Technology Program (ATP) run by the Department of Commerce. Between its
inception in 1990 and 1997, the programme awarded nearly one billion dollars in
research and development funding to approximately 300 technology-based projects conducted by American companies and industry-led joint ventures. From
1990 to 1997, 36% of ATP funding went to small businesses, with an additional
10% going to joint ventures led by small businesses.
In particular, we asked how the public sector could interact with the venture
community and other providers of capital to entrepreneurial firms in order to
most effectively advance the innovation process. Reflecting the early state of
knowledge and lack of a theoretical foundation, we did not analyse these
challenging questions through a large-sample analysis. Rather, we relied on
seven case studies of ATP firms, complemented by a review of the secondary
literature.
As part of this analysis, we highlighted four key recommendations, which are
likely to be more generally applicable to public venture capital programmes. In
this section, we will review each of these recommendations. I particularly highlight
our final recommendation, which emphasises the extent to which the premise that
technologies in entrepreneurial firms can be evaluated in the absence of the
consideration of the business prospects of the firm.
First, there is a strong need for public officials to invest in building relationships
with and an understanding of the US venture capital industry. Financing small
entrepreneurial firms is exceedingly challenging. The venture capital industry
employs a variety of important mechanisms to address these challenges, which
empirical evidence suggests are quite effective. Because of the magnitude and
success of venture capital financing, it is important that administrators view their
actions in the context of this financial institution.
A corollary to this first point is that public venture capital investments should
be made with an eye to the narrow technological focus and uneven levels of
independent investments. As noted above, venture investments tend to be very
focused into a few areas of technology that are perceived to have great potential.
Increases in venture fundraising - which are driven by factors such as shifts in
capital gains tax rates - appear more likely to lead to more intense price competition for transactions within an existing set of technologies than to greater
diversity in the types of companies funded. (These patterns are discussed in
Gompers and Lerner (2000).) Administrators may wish to respond to these industries conditions by (i) focusing on technologies which are not currently
popular among venture investors and (ii) providing follow-on capital to firms

already funded by venture capitalists during periods when venture inflows are
falling.
A third point is that federal officials must appreciate the need for flexibility that
is central to the venture capital investment process. Venture capitalists make investments into young firms in settings with tremendous technological, product
market, and management uncertainties. Rather than undertaking the (often impossible) task of addressing all the uncertainties in advance, they remain actively
involved after the investment, using their contractually specified control rights to
guide the firm. These changes - which often involve shifts in product market
strategy and the management team - are an integral part of the investment process. In our case studies, it appeared that ATP administrators too often view these
shifts as troubling indications that awardees are deviating from plan, rather than as
a natural part of their evolution.5
Fourth, just as the venture capital community carefully analyses the track record
of entrepreneurs they are considering funding, government officials should examine the track record of the firms receiving public venture awards. As it is now,
public venture capital programmes are often characterised by a considerable
number of underachieving firms. (The presence of 'SBIR mills' who have won
large numbers of awards by cultivating relationships with federal officials is a
manifestation of this phenomenon in another federal programme, as Lerner
(1999) discusses.) In particular, certain company characteristics - attributes that
may not be adequately considered in the selection process of these programmes appear to be highly correlated with a company's ability to achieve its research and
commercialisation goals. These include the experience of the management team,
the presence of a clear product market strategy, and a strong desire to seek private
financing. By devising new methods to search for such factors, government officials
would be better able to distinguish between high-performing and underachieving
firms.
Our research indicates that a prevalent characteristic among underachieving
companies is the existence of research grants from numerous government sources,
with few, if any, tangible results to show from previous R&D awards. Because a lack
of results can easily be attributed to the high-risk nature of technology development, many of these companies can avoid accountability indefinitely. These government grant-oriented research organisations are able to drift from one Federal
contract to the next. For such companies, it appeared that public venture capital
funds were treated in exactly the same manner as other government research
grants: it did not appear that ATP funding showed any notable returns or that the
unique programme goals were well-served.
Adding to the problem is the fact that companies with substantial government
grant experience appear to have several advantages over other firms when applying
for future public awards. Past grants, regardless of project outcomes, help a
5Of course, since the goal of the programme is to fund companies that are developing socially
beneficial technologies, there is a need for programme officers to be alert for firms who radically shift
their objectives. For instance, one supercomputer firm devoted considerable resources after receiving
an ATP award to developing an e-commerce programme, at a time when such technologies were
receiving extensive funding from independent venture capitalists.

company gain legitimacy in a particular area of research, as well as acquire the
equipment and personnel needed to do future work. There is also a tendency for
some government programmes to try to 'piggyback' on other government programmes, hoping to leverage their grant dollars. In addition, firms gain considerable insight on the grant application process with each proposal they submit.
These firms consequentially often have a greater chance of being awarded future
government grants than other firms. The end result can be a stream of government funding being awarded to companies that consistently underachieve.
To level the playing field, our research suggests that public venture capital
should more closely scrutinise the amount of funding a company has received
from prior government sources. A greater number of underachieving firms could
be weeded out if government officials conducted a more comprehensive evaluation of a company's past performance and examined the tangible progress attributable to each government grant the firm has received. Moreover, large inflows
of prior government funding without significant product development may indicate that a particular company is unlikely to generate significant commercialisation
of new technologies.
Another telltale characteristic of underachieving firms was the existence of
factors outside the scope of the publicly funded projects that undermined their
ability to complete successfully and later commercialise government-funded
technology. Legal troubles, for instance, can divert substantial amounts of human
and financial resources away from a company's R&D projects and even cause
dramatic changes in the size and structure of the company. And when a firm is
ready to commercialise its technology, the liability concerns associated with
pending legal battles will often drastically impair the company's ability to attract
venture capital investment dollars.
For early-stage companies, additional limiting factors frequently involve managers who lack experience in running small companies. Although some of these
managers may have accumulated business experience as consultants or as members of large organisations, the successful operation of early-stage companies can
demand very different management skills. It thus comes as no surprise that when
venture capitalists sink substantial funds in a company, they will often place their
own hand-picked manager in charge - typically an individual who has already been
successful in managing an early-stage company in a similar industry. Because much
of the skills needed for managing start-up companies comes through experience,
the existence of managers who do not have this background can significantly
undermine a company's ability to succeed.
In a broader context, each of these performance-undermining factors emphasises the need for the government officials to evaluate critically whether a particular company is a viable vehicle for accomplishing its commercialisation goals.
This goes far beyond a simple assessment of the feasibility of a business plan. In
fact, many of these potentially limiting factors will not even be discussed in a
company's written proposal to the government. It is tempting, of course, to
attribute the failures resulting from such factors to the high-risk nature of the
technology. But to a large extent, companies exhibiting a high potential for
underachievement could be more thoroughly weeded out by placing a greater

MEET ENTREPRENEURS

F83

emphasis on these factors during the selection process. The R&D project itself may
be high-risk, but the risks of turning the technology into a product should be
minimised. Regardless of how innovative or enabling a technology may be, or how
well a business plan is constructed, if these undermining factors are present, a
company will be hard pressed to succeed. In short, the claim that technological
projects can be assessed in entrepreneurial firms without consideration of business
issues is profoundly mistaken.
A broader implication is that administrators of public venture capital programmes must think carefully about the validity of the concept of 'pre-commercial
research' in an entrepreneurial setting. An extensive body of entrepreneurship
research has highlighted the unpredictability of the entrepreneurial process. Very
few entrepreneurs, whether in high- or low-technology settings, commercialise
what they initially set to develop in their original time-frame. Rather, successful
entrepreneurs gather signals from the marketplace in response to their initial
efforts, and adjust their plans accordingly. Once they identify an opportunity, they
move very rapidly to take advantage of it before major corporations can respond.
Yet many federal agencies, leery of being seen as 'picking winners', push entrepreneurs to devote funds to purely pre-commercial research. This may lead to
them ignoring an essential source of information: ie, feedback from customers.
Even more detrimental have been instances where companies - having identified
an attractive commercial opportunity - are afraid to pursue it rapidly, lest they
jeopardise their public funds (which they are relying on as a key source of financing) on the grounds that they are pursuing commercial research. While wellintentioned, such policies may have the perverse effect of punishing success. One
potential change would be to allow firms that rapidly commercialise publicly
funded projects to use the funds to pursue another project.
