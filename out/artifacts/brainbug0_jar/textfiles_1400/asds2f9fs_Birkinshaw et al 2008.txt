We define management innovation as the invention and implementation of a management practice, process, structure, or technique that is new to the state of the art
and is intended to further organizational goals. Adopting an intraorganizational
evolutionary perspective, we examine the roles of key change agents inside and
outside the organization in driving and shaping four processes—motivation, invention, implementation, and theorization and labeling—that collectively define a model
of how management innovation comes about.

research lab and GM’s invention of the M-form
organization structure), the amount of detailed
knowledge about how management innovation
is actually implemented is limited.
In its broadest sense, management innovation has, of course, received considerable research attention over the years. As we discuss
in the following section, there are four key
perspectives in the literature: (1) an institutional perspective that focuses on the socioeconomic conditions in which new management ideas and practices take shape (e.g.,
Guillén, 1994); (2) a fashion perspective that
focuses on the dynamic interplay between users and providers of management ideas (e.g.,
Abrahamson, 1996); (3) a cultural perspective
that focuses on how an organization reacts to
the introduction of a new management practice (e.g., Zbaracki, 1998); and (4) a rational
perspective that focuses on how management
innovations—and the individuals who drive
them— deliver improvements in organizational effectiveness (e.g., Chandler, 1962). There is
also a related body of literature concerned
with the subsequent diffusion of management
innovations across industries or countries
(e.g., Guler, Guillén, & MacPherson, 2002). But
useful as these bodies of literature are, they
have surprisingly little to say about the generative mechanisms by which new management ideas are first created and put into practice. To state the point slightly differently, our
understanding of the processes of management innovation is currently very limited and

Over the past half-century, scholars around
the world have produced a vast body of academic research and writing on innovation.
While most of this research has focused on various aspects of technological innovation (e.g.,
Henderson & Clark, 1990; Utterback, 1994), the
trend over the last fifteen years has been toward
exploring other forms of innovation, such as process innovation (e.g., Pisano, 1996), service innovation (e.g., Gallouj & Weinstein, 1997), and strategic innovation (Hamel, 1998; Markides, 1997),
with a view to understanding how they are managed and how they contribute to long-term firm
success.
The focus in this article is on a relatively underresearched form of innovation—management
innovation—and particularly the processes
through which it occurs. We apply a relatively
narrow definition of management innovation—
specifically, the invention and implementation
of a management practice, process, structure, or
technique that is new to the state of the art and
is intended to further organizational goals.
While many of the landmarks of management
innovation are familiar to every business

of Management.

is based largely on a few well-known examples, such as Chandler’s (1962) documentation
of the emergence of the M-form structure. What
is required—and what we provide a first step
toward in this article—is a systematic and
grounded process theory of how management
innovation transpires.
We focus on the specific actions individuals
inside or outside the firm might undertake that
lead to the emergence of a management innovation—what we might call “management innovating,” as a way of capturing the potentially critical role of human agency in the
process. We address two specific questions.
First, what is management innovation? How
can we define management innovation in a
useful and rigorous way that emphasizes its
distinctiveness? Second, and building on the
first question, what are the processes through
which management innovation comes about?
What does the literature tell us about the typical sequence of actions followed by individuals inside and outside the organization that
result in the creation of management innovation? And to what extent can we induce a
general set of arguments about the causal
mechanisms through which management innovation takes place? The article concludes
with some thoughts about the future research
agenda that might be pursued to further advance our understanding of management innovation.
WHAT IS MANAGEMENT INNOVATION?
Management innovation involves the introduction of novelty in an established organization, and as such it represents a particular form
of organizational change. In its broadest sense,
then, management innovation can be defined as
a difference in the form, quality, or state over
time of the management activities in an organization, where the change is a novel or unprecedented departure from the past (Hargrave & Van
de Ven, 2006; Van de Ven & Poole, 1995: 512). On
the basis of this high-level definition, we identified four distinct perspectives on management
innovation in the literature, as summarized in
Table 1. These four should be seen as the dominant perspectives around which research has
clustered in the past, rather than as theoretically comprehensive in terms of the domain that
they cover. Our approach draws to some degree

October

on insights from all four perspectives but relates
most closely to the rational perspective.
Four Perspectives on Management Innovation
Proponents of the institutional perspective
take a macrolevel and comparative approach to
make sense of the institutional and socioeconomic conditions in which particular management innovations emerge. For example, Guillén
(1994) examined the impact of seven sets of institutional factors on the introduction of new
managerial ideologies and techniques across
four countries; Cole (1985) focused on how the
balance between labor market incentives that
are mostly set by the state, the relative strength
of industry associations, and the predisposition
of organized labor influenced the introduction of
small-group activities in different countries; and
Kossek (1987) examined industry- and firm-level
influences on the emergence of human resource
management innovations. Normative beliefs
about what is progressive may drive management innovation, but those beliefs are also subject to long Kondratieff waves of economic
change in which new technologies occur and
create performance gaps that then necessitate
management innovation (Abrahamson, 1997;
Barley & Kunda, 1992). The institutional perspective measures innovation in terms of the discourse around particular ideologies and also at
the level of specific practices or techniques. It
gives no direct consideration to the role of human agency in shaping the process; instead, it
focuses on the preconditions in which an innovation first emerges and then the factors that
enable industries to adopt such innovations.
The fashion perspective focuses on how management innovations emerge through the dynamic interplay between the managers who use
new management ideas and the “fashion setters” who put forward those ideas (Abrahamson,
1991, 1996). This perspective provides a wealth of
insight into how management fashions take
shape, including a detailed understanding of
the typical attributes of managers who buy into
these fashions (Gill & Whittle, 1993; Huczynski,
1993; Jackson, 1986), as well as the ways in which
fashion setters shape incipient demand for their
ideas (Benders & van Veen, 2001; Clark, 2004;
Kieser, 1997; Mazza & Alvarez, 2000). However, it
has little to say about the true origins of management fashions, or why certain innovations

become fashions while others do not. The fashion perspective spans the macro and micro levels of analysis, with a concern both for the industry that supplies new management ideas
and for the behavioral reasons why individual
managers choose to buy into those ideas. Management fashions can exist as abstract ideas or
rhetorics, or as specific practices or techniques.
Proponents of the cultural perspective attempt
to understand how management innovation
shapes, and gets shaped by, the culture of the
organization in which it is being implemented. It
operates at the meso level of analysis by looking at how individual attitudes toward management innovation interact with the organization-

level introduction of the innovation. One strand
of this literature takes a critical perspective
(Knights & McCabe, 2000; McCabe, 2002) while
the other adopts an intraorganizational process
perspective (Stjernberg & Philips, 1993; Zbaracki,
1998), but both share some common themes: a
recognition that established organizations do
not change easily, that management innovation
has both rhetorical and technical components,
and that the outcome of the introduction of a
management innovation is rarely what was intended by the senior executives who introduced
it. Unlike the two previous perspectives, the cultural perspective provides some insight into
how management innovations are imple-

<-----Page 3----->828

Academy of Management Review

mented, though primarily from the point of view
of those who are being asked to participate in
the process, rather than those who are driving it.
The outcome of management innovation according to this perspective is typically a reinforcement of the status quo (McCabe, 2002). This perspective does not deny that changes can occur
as a result of management innovation, but the
forces at work in large organizations typically
dampen its impact.
The rational perspective builds on the
premise that management innovations are introduced by individuals with the goal of making
their organizations work more effectively. According to this perspective, an individual puts
forward an innovative solution to address a specific problem that the organization is facing, and
he or she then champions its implementation
and adoption (Burgelman, 1983; Howell & Higgins, 1990). Some studies from this perspective
have favored a case study methodology (e.g.,
Chandler, 1962; Tichy & Sandstrom, 1974),
whereas others have used large-sample quantitative approaches (Damanpour, 1987; Kimberly
& Evanisko, 1981), but all studies span the micromacro levels of analysis by focusing on the actions of key individuals within an organizational
and environmental context. There is also a subtheme within this perspective concerned with
the links between management and technological innovation, which suggests that they may
coevolve (Damanpour & Evan, 1984; Ettlie, 1988;
Georgantzas & Shapiro, 1993).
An Operational Definition of Management
Innovation
This review of the literature highlights the
very different approaches researchers have
used to make sense of the phenomenon of management innovation, and it helps us to focus on
three key questions that arise as we seek to
develop an operational definition.
First, what exactly is being innovated?
There is little consistency in the terminology
within or across the four perspectives, but we
believe it is useful to separate out two levels
of analysis. At the more abstract level are
management ideas, defined by Kramer as
“fairly stable bodies of knowledge about what
managers ought to do. . . . a system of assumptions, accepted principles and rules of procedure” (1975: 47). Examples of management

ideas are scientific management, total quality
management (TQM), and the learning organization. While not identical, this concept of a
management idea is comparable to Guillén’s
(1994) notion of an organizational ideology,
along with Barley and Kunda’s (1992), Abrahamson’s (1996), and Suddaby and Greenwood’s
(2005) notions of management rhetoric.1 At the
more operational level we can identify management practices, management processes,
management techniques, and organizational
structures2 (Alänge et al., 1998; Guillén, 1994)
as different facets of the rules and routines by
which work gets done inside organizations (for
the sake of readability, we use the term management practices throughout the remainder
of the article to cover this full range of activities). In definitional terms this article focuses
on management innovation at the operational
level—that is, in terms of the generation and
implementation of new practices, processes,
structures, or techniques— because this is the
level at which observable changes take place
in the way work is done and the management
innovation process can be witnessed. But, as
will become clear, there is an important interaction between the development of new management practices and new management
ideas, so our theoretical arguments will give
due consideration to both levels of analysis.
Second, how new does an innovation have to
be? There are two equally valid points of view
in the literature. Abrahamson (1996) and Kimberly (1981) define an innovation as “new to
the state of the art,” which essentially means

1
Guillén states that organizational ideologies “can serve
as cognitive tools that managers use to sort out the complexities of reality, frame the relevant issues, and choose among
alternative paths of action” (1994: 4). Abrahamson defines
rhetoric as “spoken or written discourse that justifies the use
of a set of techniques for managing organizations or their
employees” (1996: 259).
2
By bracketing these elements together, we end up with a
broad phenomenon. But the distinctions among practice,
process, structure, and techniques are not clean, either conceptually or empirically, so it would be difficult to define
management innovation in a way that excluded one or other
of them. Moreover, our analysis suggests that there are important similarities across the different forms of management innovation, especially with regard to how they are
generated. We therefore find it useful to bracket together
management innovations across these areas, “as if they
constitute a homogeneous entity” (Alänge, Jacobsson, &
Jarnehammar, 1998: 7).

<-----Page 4----->2008

Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol

without known precedent. But many other researchers implicitly see innovation as “new to
the organization” so that, for example, the initial introduction of a TQM program to an organization might be categorized as a management innovation (e.g., McCabe, 2002; Zbaracki,
1998). Our interest in this article is in new to
the state of the art innovations, for the primary
reason that this is the area where existing
knowledge is the most limited. But the boundary between the two definitions is blurred: if
one considers a spectrum of approaches to the
implementation of management practices, on
the left side an organization might buy an “off
the shelf” practice from a consultancy, and
on the right side it might come up with a
completely novel innovation of its own. Our
interest is on those innovations toward the
right side of the spectrum, where the level of
adaptation to the specific context of the innovating organization is high and where there is
a considerable level of uncertainty regarding
its outcome.
Third, what is the purpose of management
innovation? Proponents of both the fashion and
cultural perspectives see management innovation as having little lasting impact on the organization, whereas those of the institutional and
rational perspectives view management innovation as generating positive outcomes for the
innovating firm and/or for society as a whole. As
suggested earlier, our focus is aligned most directly with the rational perspective in that we
view management innovation as intending to
further the organization’s goals, which may include both traditional aspects of performance
(e.g., financial goals) and softer aspects (e.g.,
employee satisfaction). This is appropriate because it helps to explain why firms are prepared
to engage in the costly and somewhat risky process of management innovation in the first
place. This approach serves to underline the
important point that not all management innovations are ultimately successful. For example,
Volvo experimented for many years with cellular manufacturing, with the intention of delivering significant benefits, but the innovation was
ultimately discontinued (Berggren, 1992). Moreover, it should also be noted that goals are
rarely entirely exogenous to the organization;
indeed, the process of innovating can result in
the introduction of new practices or programs

829

that ultimately change the organization’s goals
(Selznick, 1957).
In sum, we define management innovation3 as
the generation and implementation of a management practice, process, structure, or technique that is new to the state of the art and is
intended to further organizational goals (see Table 2 for a list of examples). And while it is not a
necessary component of our definition, it is
worth reinforcing that our perspective on management innovation gives conscious attention to
the individuals who drive the process. Indeed,
one of the themes of this article is the need to
increase the emphasis on human agency in
management innovation while not losing sight
of the contextual dynamics that are the focus of
the institutional and fashion perspectives. As
McCabe puts it, “What is required is an understanding of innovation as part of a far more
complex social process: interrelated to the way
in which individuals interpret, act, and ascribe
meaning to the world” (2002: 509).
Management Innovation versus Related
Constructs
Having established an operational definition
of management innovation, we still need to
make a prima facie case that a theoretical discussion of the process of management innovation—in its own right—is necessary.
We propose three key factors that make management innovation distinctive. First, there are
important differences in the nature of the outputs
of management innovation and technological innovation that affect how the respective processes
unfold. Management innovations are typically
tacit in nature and “difficult if not impossible to
protect by patent” (Teece, 1980: 464); they are also
relatively “difficult to observe, define and to iden-

3

It should be noted that there are several related terms in
use: managerial innovation (Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981), administrative innovation (Damanpour & Evan, 1984), organizational innovation (Alänge et al., 1998; Damanpour & Evan,
1984; Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981), and management innovation (Abrahamson, 1991; Kossek, 1987; Stata, 1989). Organizational innovation is sometimes used to imply any type of
innovation generated by organizations, including new products. Administrative innovation typically refers to a narrow
range of innovations around organizational structure and
human resource policies and does not include innovations
in, for instance, marketing or operations management. We
therefore prefer the term management innovation.

Taken together, these attributes allow a higher
level of subjective interpretation on the part of the
potential user than is common with technological
innovations, which, in turn, increases the importance of the social and political processes followed by the proponents of the innovation.
Second, very few organizations have wellestablished and specialized expertise in the
area of management innovation. A typical large
organization might employ tens or hundreds of
scientists with technological innovation skills
but few, if any, with proven management innovation skills (the closest are organization development consultants, who seek systemic ways of
improving the overall effectiveness and health
of the organization). This lack of expertise both
heightens the uncertainty of management innovation for people across the organization and
increases the need for external support.
Third, the introduction of something new to
the state of the art creates ambiguity and uncertainty for the individuals in an organization.
Ambiguity arises because of a lack of understanding of the intended value of the innovation,

and uncertainty arises because of a fear that the
innovation will have negative consequences for
the individual and/or the organization. If an organizational change is proposed that has already been successfully implemented elsewhere (e.g., the installation of a new IT system),
its proponents can allay the concerns of individuals by referring back to those prior successes,
but if the change is new to the state of the art, then
the task of reducing ambiguity and uncertainty is
much harder. Of course, all types of innovation
generate uncertainty and ambiguity, but their impact in the case of management innovation is
likely to be more far-reaching because of the rest
of the attributes identified above.
Taken together, these attributes suggest that
the management innovation process can potentially require fundamental changes in the routines or DNA of the organization4 (Argyris &
Schön, 1978) that make it very difficult to undertake in an effective manner, and significantly

4
We are indebted to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this point.

<-----Page 6----->2008

Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol

harder than the generic process of organizational
change (where the change is just new to the
organization rather than the state of the art) or
the process of technological innovation (where
the innovation is relatively more tangible and
less system dependent). These factors, in turn,
highlight the need for management innovators
to seek out distinctive approaches to building
the legitimacy of the new practice to make it
acceptable to the various constituencies in the
organization (Ashforth & Gibbs, 1990; Greenwood, Hinings, & Suddaby, 2002; Suchman, 1995).
One such approach is likely to be a greater
degree of emphasis on independent validation
from external sources to establish the legitimacy
of the new practice than would be the case for a
generic organizational change activity (where
previous successful changes can be referred to)
or a technological innovation (which is more
likely to have objective benefits and/or a technical standard to which it subscribes). Such external sources can be useful providers of both
moral and cognitive legitimacy in the absence
of hard evidence that management innovation
will be valuable and can allow the innovators to
“manipulate the environmental structure by creating new audiences and new legitimating beliefs” (Suchman, 1995: 587).
A second approach is likely to be for the innovators to focus their efforts on organizations (or
specific units within organizations) with prior
experience in management innovation, on the
basis that these organizations/units understand
the challenge faced by the management innovators and are therefore likely to be more tolerant of the uncertainty and ambiguity it brings
(Kossek, 1989). In legitimacy-seeking terms, this
can be seen as a strategy to “select among multiple environments in pursuit of an audience
that will support current practices” (Suchman,
1995: 587).
It is also useful to briefly consider the difference between a management innovation and a
management fashion—a “relatively transitory
collective belief that a management technique
[or idea] leads to rational management
progress” (Abrahamson, 1996: 257). For the most
part, management innovations can be thought
of as potential management fashions: some,
such as Six Sigma and the balanced scorecard,
become management fashions when they get
taken up by a significant number of management fashion users; others either die out or re-

831

main in use in a relatively small number of
firms. But it is also possible for management
fashions that are expressed in highly abstract
terms to spur management innovations. For example, the knowledge management fashion of
the early 1990s led individuals and organizations to put in place specific practices, such as
communities of practice, that were management
innovations in their own right. We return to the
relationship between management innovation
and management fashion in the discussion.
THE PROCESSES OF MANAGEMENT
INNOVATION
The second part of this article addresses the
question “What are the processes through which
management innovations come about?” Building on our conception of what makes management innovation unique, we develop a framework that highlights the four interlinked phases
of the process and the roles played by two key
sets of stakeholders. This framework is then
fleshed out using theoretical arguments and examples from the management literature.
The framework, illustrated in Figure 1, has
two dimensions. The horizontal dimension consists of four phases of the innovation process: (1)
motivation is concerned with the facilitating
factors and precipitating circumstances that
lead individuals to consider developing their
own management innovation; (2) invention is an
initial act of experimentation out of which a new
hypothetical management practice emerges; (3)
implementation is the technical process of establishing the value of the new management
innovation in vivo (i.e., in a real setting); and (4)
theorization and labeling is a social process
whereby individuals inside and outside the organization make sense of and validate the management innovation to build its legitimacy.
This four-phase process builds on the intrafirm evolutionary perspective advanced by
Burgelman (1991) and Zbaracki (1998), whereby
changes perceived in the environment (motivation) lead to variations in management practices (invention), some of which are then subject
to internal selection (implementation) and retention (theorization and labeling). We expect the
process to be shaped in large part by the conscious and deliberate actions of key individuals,
but we also recognize there is a role for unintended actions by individuals and random

<-----Page 7----->832

FIGURE 1
Management Innovation Process Framework

changes inside the organization in affecting the
process of management innovation.
As per the vertical dimension in Figure 1, we
expect two groups of individuals to shape the
process: (1) internal change agents, who are the
employees of the innovating company proactive
in creating interest in, experimenting with, and
validating the management innovation in question (DiMaggio, 1988; Howell & Higgins, 1990),
and (2) external change agents, who, similar to
Guillén’s (1994) management intellectuals and
Abrahamson and Fairchild’s (2001) idea entrepreneurs, are independent consultants, academics, and gurus proactive in creating interest in,
influencing the development of, and legitimizing the effectiveness and retention of new management practices (DiMaggio, 1991). As suggested earlier, we expect external change
agents to play a major role in management innovation because they provide legitimacy and
expertise in many different phases of the process. They can give credibility to the original
idea that sparks off the experiment inside the
company, they can act as sounding boards or

action researchers alongside the internal team
during the implementation phase, and they can
play a role in theorizing about and labeling the
innovation (Chandler, 1962; Kaplan, 1998; Pezet,
1997; Stjernberg & Philips, 1993; Yorks & Whitsett, 1985).
A key feature of this framework is that it
does not assume a simple left-to-right sequence of activities. As Zbaracki observes, the
processes of innovation typically will be complex, recursive, and occurring “in nested and
repeated cycles of variation, selection and retention” (1998: 612). We address this point by
focusing our attention on how individuals iterate between the adjacent cells in the framework, identifying ten core activities.5 For example, the activity “problem-driven search”
involves internal change agents’ iterating
5

It is quite possible to propose activities that span nonadjacent boxes—for example, between boxes 1 and 6. Our
analysis, however, suggests that such activities are probably rare, so in the interests of keeping the framework relatively simple, we focus on the ten core activities.

<-----Page 8----->2008

back and forth between motivation and invention, whereas the activity “agenda setting”
involves interaction between internal and
external change agents (cf. Burgelman, 1983,
1991).
Figure 1 identifies the ten core activities (indicated by the double arrows and text spanning the
boxes) and the nature of the innovation or its constituent parts (indicated by the numbered text
within each box). Figure 1 also indicates the important role of context in shaping management
innovation. Organizational context is the administrative and social mechanisms that management can manipulate to shape the behaviors of actors in the organization (Bower, 1970;
Burgelman, 1983) and will have a direct impact
(positive or negative) on the ability of internal
change agents to pursue the core activities associated with management innovation. Environmental context is the broad set of stimuli— exogenous
to the focal organization—that shapes the management discourse (Guillén, 1994) and thereby influences the priorities and efforts of external
change agents as they engage with organizations.
While these two aspects of context potentially influence all activities associated with management innovation, we discuss them in detail only in
those places where their role is critical.
Motivation Phase
The motivation phase refers to the preconditions and facilitating factors that lead individuals in a company to be motivated to experiment
with a new management innovation. It addresses the question “Under what conditions, or
in what circumstances, do executives deem existing management practices to be inadequate
for their needs?” The answer to this question is
far from straightforward because it is necessary
not only to identify the conditions under which
executives search for new management innovations but also to specify the circumstances in
which they choose not to adopt one of the existing solutions that can be obtained in prefabricated form from the so-called management fashion-setting community (Abrahamson, 1996). For
management innovation to occur, in other
words, the market for management fashions has
to fail.
Internal change agents. Consider first those
on the “demand” side of the market. Established
theory suggests that the demand for new man-

833

agement practices is driven by the identification
of a novel problem—a perceived shortfall between the organization’s current and potential
performance6 (Barley & Kunda, 1992; Cyert &
March, 1963; Guillén, 1994). A perceived shortfall
can be caused by a problem that undermines
current performance but also by opportunities
that may exist and the anticipation of environmental changes (Cyert & March, 1963; Ocasio,
1997). In some instances individual managers in
an organization may attribute this shortfall simply to a failure to execute under existing arrangements, but in others they may identify a
specific problem or opportunity vis-à-vis their
existing management practices. They engage in
a problem-driven search process that begins
with existing and proximate contacts, and once
they find a satisfactory solution, they terminate
the search and implement the solution.
In cases where the individuals choose to look
outside their own organization for a solution,
they are confronted with a management fashion-setting community, which shapes the belief
systems of users as to what is rational and peddles its particular solutions to users’ problems
or perceived opportunities. Constrained both by
the pressure to conform to the norms of rationality of the organization’s institutional field and
by the costs of evaluating multiple competing
offers, managers will often choose to adopt the
solution that appears to be the most progressive
and legitimate (Abrahamson, 1996). This, of
course, is the process through which management fashions spread.
Sometimes, however, managers will choose to
experiment with developing their own solutions
to the problem or performance shortfall they are
addressing. In the language of institutional theory, such an act can potentially “appear irrational and retrogressive” (Abrahamson, 1996: 263),
but there are several conditions under which it
may transpire—when the pressure to try something new overcomes the pressure to conform to
externally arbitrated management norms. We
suggest two such conditions. The first is where

6

We acknowledge that the notion of a perceived shortfall
implies some cognitive process through which environmental changes are converted into action. In other words, some
individuals will be able to interpret changes, whereas others may not. These cognitive processes, however, are not our
central concern here, and, hence, we simply assume they
take place.

<-----Page 9----->834

Academy of Management Review

internal change agents are able, through an
agenda-setting activity, to frame the problem or
opportunity such that internal stakeholders
view it as genuinely new or as something that
cannot be resolved by buying an existing solution from the fashion-setting community. Consider, for example, the Danish hearing-aid manufacturer Oticon. Its CEO at the time, Lars
Kolind, was able to convince his employees and
board of directors that Oticon faced a significant
threat to its viability from large competitors,
such as Philips and Siemens, and this was sufficient for him to push through a radical innovation that he labeled the spaghetti organization
(Foss, 2003; Lovas & Ghoshal, 2000).
The second broad condition is when the organizational context is supportive of new thinking and thereby enhances the degree of freedom
for internal change agents to pursue novel
ideas. The notion of a supportive organizational
context has been conceived in two broad ways
in the literature, both of which are potentially
relevant here. One set of arguments focuses on
the role of management in creating an informal
context that encourages individuals to take initiative (Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1994). For example,
the more exposure managers have to different
industries and organizations, the more receptive
they are likely to be to ideas for new practices
(e.g., Oldham & Cummings, 1996). The other set
of arguments is more concerned with the formal
processes of the organization and the extent to
which they institutionalize the pursuit of new or
better ways of working. For example, we might
expect the rigor of the decision-making process
in the organization to have a positive influence
on internal change agent motivation because,
by clarifying the pros and cons, the uncertainty
and ambiguity associated with an idea are reduced.
In sum, internal change agents evaluate a
problem or opportunity through an agendasetting dialogue with external change agents
that helps to establish its novelty, and with reference back to the supportiveness of the current
organizational context. To the extent that the
problem or opportunity can be framed as novel
and the context is supportive, the preconditions
for management innovation exist.
External change agents. The role of external
change agents in motivating management innovation begins with their ability to identify new
threats and opportunities in the business envi-

October

ronment that require management attention.
But, as above, this is only part of the story because many external change agents see their
role as stimulating managers (through the agenda-setting process) to adopt an existing or fashionable practice, rather than to create a new
one. We suggest that the nature of the management knowledge that external change agents
share with their internal counterparts is an important factor in motivating management innovation. One can identify a spectrum of management knowledge, with new ideologies and ideas
at the more abstract end and new practices and
techniques at the more practical end. Those external agents who focus on the practical end of
the spectrum, with standardized or “off the
shelf” solutions to the problems facing managers, will encourage the adoption of management
fashions. In contrast, those external change
agents who focus on the more abstract end of
the spectrum will more likely provide a fertile
environment for management innovation because of the “interpretive viability” of their
ideas—that is, the extent to which these ideas
can be adapted to multiple agendas (Benders &
van Veen, 2001; Clark, 2004).
External change agents can interact both directly and indirectly with internal change
agents in agenda setting.7 They generate their
influential points of view by linking their interpretation of changes in the environmental context with agenda-setting conversations about
the practical issues executives face. They are
also influenced by prior cases of management
innovation they have been involved with; in Figure 1 this feedback loop is indicated by the three
horizontal processes (idea contextualizing, idea
refining, and reflective theorizing) that we discuss in greater detail below.
Invention Phase
Invention refers to either random or planned
variations in management practices, some of
7

An example of direct interaction is the U.K.-based “Beyond Budgeting Round Table” (Hope & Fraser, 2003), whose
founders worked actively with many organizations to help
them make sense of the limitations of their traditional budgeting systems. An example of indirect influence is Tom
Peter’s 1987 book, Thriving on Chaos, which was the inspiration for an innovative organization structure at Wellington, a Canadian insurance company (Birkinshaw & Mol,
2006).

<-----Page 10----->2008

Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol

which subsequently are selected and retained
by the organization (Burgelman, 1991; Campbell,
1965). It is the phase in which a hypothetical new
practice is first tried out in an experimental way.
Internal change agents. Figure 1 suggests
three ways in which internal change agents
might come up with a hypothetical new practice:
problem-driven search, trial and error, and idea
linking with external change agents. While
each of these subprocesses has value in its own
right, our expectation is that invention is more
likely when they are applied in combination,
just as new technologies typically arise through
novel combinations of existing ideas and practices (Hargadon, 2003: 65; Kogut & Zander, 1992;
Schumpeter, 1947).
Problem-driven search is a conscious and often planned activity in which individuals seek
to create a new practice in response to a specific
problem or opportunity (Cyert & March, 1963).
Chandler’s (1962) description of Alfred Sloan’s
introduction of the M-form structure suggests a
process of this type: Sloan’s proposed changes
in 1920 were a direct response to the complexity
that had been created by bringing together five
independent businesses. As Sloan himself
noted, “I wrote the ‘Organizational Study’ for
General Motors as a possible solution for the
specific problems created by the expansion of
the corporation after World War I” (Sloan, 1963:
32).
Idea linking is when individuals in the organization make connections between the new
ideas proposed by external change agents and
the experimental efforts underway inside the
organization. Such connections can be viewed
as a form of brokering between relatively disparate networks (Granovetter, 1973; Hargadon,
2003), and they can be nurtured by encouraging
individuals to read widely and to attend conferences and other networking events. For example, the concept of activity-based costing was
developed by Robert Kaplan, a business school
professor, through conversations at a conference
with executives at Scovill Corporation and John
Deere Component Works about new cost measurement approaches they were experimenting
with (Kaplan, 1998: 98). Kaplan had been developing his own ideas about ways of overcoming
the failure of existing cost measurement systems (idea contextualizing), and the Scovill and
Deere executives had been experimenting inside their own organizations (trial and error). But

835

the birth of activity-based costing per se came
when Kaplan and the corporate executives began to interact.
Finally, trial and error occurs when the feedback about a new idea comes from trying it out
in practice, rather than from how well it solves
an existing problem or how well it fits with the
ideas of an external change agent. We can expect trial and error to be an important part of
any effective management innovation (when undertaken in combination with other activities),
but it is also possible for trial and error to be an
unintended or ad hoc starting point for the
whole process. For example, furniture retailer
IKEA allowed its customers to pick up their own
flat-pack products from the warehouse because
of staffing shortages at a busy time, and this
practice proved so effective (though in ways that
were not foreseen when it was first tried out)
that it was rapidly implemented in other stores
(Bartlett & Nanda, 1990). New practices can
emerge through serendipitous events of this
type, and they can also occur when an existing
practice is adapted to fit different circumstances
(Czarniawska & Sevón, 2005; Mamman, 2002;
Sturdy, 2004).
External change agents. The role of external
change agents in the invention phase mirrors
that of internal change agents. In other words,
their ability to come up with a new idea for
management practices is a function of three often-linked activities: idea contextualizing, idea
refining, and idea linking. Idea contextualizing
involves speculating on new ways of working
that potentially address threats or opportunities
in the business environment. This is a common
activity among management thinkers, involving
a back-and-forth interaction between the myriad of issues faced by managers on the one side
and the set of possible solutions on the other.
For example, Davenport and Prusak (2003: 179)
describe how their initial ideas about knowledge management emerged through the research agenda of the Ernst & Young Centre for
Business Innovation.
Idea refining can be viewed as a form of disciplined imagination (Weick, 1989), in which the
external change agent works through the implications of a particular idea in terms of how it
might work in practice or in other contextual
settings. Campbell (1974) viewed this activity as
“ideational trial and error”; it is directly analogous to the process of trial and error that inter-

<-----Page 11----->836

Academy of Management Review

nal change agents go through, but it occurs in
the conceptual domain.
Idea linking, as discussed earlier, involves
reconciling the external change agent’s knowledge base (which is typically deep in terms of
academic discipline or functional expertise)
with the context-specific ideas of internal
change agents. For example, activity-based
costing emerged through a combination of dissatisfaction with existing accounting methods
and Kaplan’s perspectives on the changing
pressures on manufacturing companies, but it
then required an explicit link to Scovill and
Deere for the concept to be put into practice
(Kaplan, 1998).
Taken together, these three activities can be
viewed as alternative but complementary approaches to theory development: idea contextualizing is about developing new solutions to existing problems, idea refining is about working
through the consequences of an idea through a
series of “thought trials” (Weick, 1989), and idea
linking is an inductive-deductive loop through
which concepts are reconciled with empirical
evidence.
Implementation Phase
The implementation phase consists of all the
activity on the “technical” side of the innovation
after the initial experiment up to the point where
the new management innovation is first fully
operational. Like Zbaracki (1998), we distinguish
between the technical elements of the work and
the rhetorical elements that are concerned with
theorizing and labeling the innovation (discussed in the next section). Our description of
this phase involves making sense of the actions
of internal and external change agents in implementing an in vivo new practice, as well as
understanding the ways existing employees react to it and influence its implementation
(Lewin, 1951).
Internal change agents. Figure 1 indicates two
primary activities that internal change agents
engage in as they attempt to implement an in
vivo new practice. One is trial and error, in
which progress is achieved by monitoring and
making adjustments against the original concept. For example, to develop Procter & Gamble’s “Connect and Develop” innovation process, its originator, Larry Huston, observed that
he ran six years of experiments before he had a

October

proven methodology for tapping into external
sources of technology (Birkinshaw, Crainer, &
Mol, 2007). The other activity is reflective experimenting, in which internal change agents evaluate progress against their broader body of experience. For example, Stjernberg and Philips
made the following observation about how such
individuals can be most effective:
As the [innovation] attempt proceeds, he [the internal change agent] needs to be able to learn
from the consequences of his own actions and to
alter these actions accordingly. He will be more
capable of seeing and learning how to manage
the change and the learning dilemmas if he has a
well-developed capacity for reflection (1993: 1199).

Organizational context also plays an important role in facilitating or inhibiting the implementation of new ideas. Zbaracki (1998) observed that the reaction of employees to
implementing new management practices is
generally negative: they are likely to be intimidated by innovations, particularly if the innovations have a significant technical component
and the employees are mostly ignorant of their
potential benefits. But the cultural perspective
on management innovation suggests employees’ reactions will also vary according to their
personal circumstances and the immediate
work environment in which they are placed
(Knights & McCabe, 2000). The implementation
process is therefore likely to involve careful maneuvering by internal change agents as they
focus their efforts on those parts of the organization that are more amenable to change. As the
literature on technological innovation describes, such tactics include pursuing corridors
of indifference through the organization, building coalitions of senior executives to support
their ideas, framing innovation as an opportunity and not a threat, accessing resources beyond the individual’s control, and maintaining a
generally tenacious and persistent attitude
(Howell & Shea, 2001; Rothwell et al., 1974; Schön
1963; Wrapp, 1967).
Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that
implementation transpires through a dialectical
process (Van de Ven & Poole, 1995). Internal
change agents try out the proposed new practice, and they evaluate its progress against the
original idea (trial and error), its conceptual validity (reflective experimenting), and the reactions of other employees (i.e., the organizational
context). Some aspects of the new practice may

<-----Page 12----->2008

Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol

prove to be unworkable, and the reactions of
employees may in some cases be directly opposed to what is being pursued. But after several iterations, an outcome will often emerge
that is a synthesis of the opposing forces
(Knights & McCabe, 2000; Zbaracki, 1998). In
other cases the internal resistance generated by
various aspects of the organizational context
may be sufficiently strong that the experimental
new practice does not get taken forward at all.
External change agents. The role played by
external change agents in the implementation
phase is less clear-cut than in other phases.
External change agents lack deep contextual
knowledge of the focal organization, as well as
the accountability for results that most internal
change agents face, so they rarely play an active role in actually implementing new ideas in
vivo. However, we suggest they potentially play
a critical indirect role in making management
innovation happen.
The essence of the external change agent’s
role is to create a thought experiment (analogous to an in vitro experiment performed by a
biologist before a new molecule is tried out in
vivo in a live body). External change agents
draw from their prior experience (reflective theorizing) and their deep knowledge of a particular conceptual domain (e.g., an academic discipline or a functional competency) to sharpen
their new idea (idea refining), and on the basis
of the insights gained, they attempt to influence
and direct the implementation efforts of the internal change agents (idea testing). There is
some evidence of what this set of activities looks
like in practice. For example, Stjernberg and
Philips (1993) highlight the roles external
change agents play as facilitators and sounding
boards, and Kaplan provides a thoughtful account of his own experiences in this area:
During this process of intimate engagement with
implementation, the action researcher [i.e., the
external change agent] not only advances the
theory underlying the concept, but also becomes
a skilled practitioner. . . . Such skill also enables
the action researcher to distinguish between theory limitations vs. poor implementations when
companies experience difficulties applying the
innovation (1998: 106).

These activities can, as Kaplan suggests, be
thought of as a form of action research—where
the aim is to “build theories within the practice
context itself, and test them there through inter-

837

vention experiments” (Argyris & Schön, 1991: 86).
In terms of our framing, the external change
agent therefore plays a dual role, oscillating
back and forth between his or her thought experiment about what might make sense in the
world of management ideas and the in vivo implementation of what actually works in the
world of practice. This dual role potentially offers great insights to both worlds. Unfortunately,
though, the evidence suggests interventions of
this type are on the decline. While action research has an illustrious past (Emery & Trist,
1960; Lewin, 1946), it has lost ground in recent
decades to more passive forms of research, a
point we return to in the discussion.
Theorization and Labeling Phase
The fourth phase results in a theorized new
practice— one that is retained and institutionalized within the organization. While an effective
implementation, as described above, is clearly a
necessary part of the process, the intangible and
system-dependent nature of management innovation means that the results of the implementation are likely to be highly unclear for several
years (Teece, 1980). We therefore expect that
there will be an important rhetorical component
associated with a successful management innovation. Key change agents will seek to make the
case with constituencies inside and outside the
organization that the new practice is legitimate,
even though this new practice represents (by
definition) a departure from the tried-and-tested
offerings of the fashion-setting community
(Abrahamson, 1996; Suchman, 1995).
We view this phase as consisting of two interlinked elements: theorization and labeling. Theorization is increasing “the zone of acceptance
by creating perceptions of similarity among
adopters and by providing rationales for the
practices to be adopted” (Greenwood et al., 2002;
Strang & Meyer, 1993; Suddaby & Greenwood,
2005; Tolbert & Zucker, 1996). In the context of
this article, theorization is therefore first about
building a logical rationale for the link between
an organization’s opportunities and the innovative solution that is being put in place, and second about expressing that logic in terms that
resonate with key constituencies inside or outside the organization. Labeling refers to the selection of a name for the management innovation in question that reflects its theorization.

<-----Page 13----->838

Academy of Management Review

Labels have been shown to have a significant
effect on the acceptability of management practices to various constituencies (Eccles & Nohria,
1992; Kieser, 1997).
Internal change agents. The primary role of
internal change agents in this phase is to build
legitimacy for the innovation among employees
of the organization.8 As a means of defusing the
widespread skepticism toward management innovation that employees often exhibit (Knights
& McCabe, 2000), internal change agents will
often theorize about the value of the new practice and label it in such a way that employees
see its potential value, and also see it as consistent with the prevailing norms of the organization. The outcome, in other words, is a new
practice that has been theorized vis-à-vis the
immediate organizational context (whereas external change agents focus on theorizing beyond this immediate context).
It is useful to apply Suchman’s (1995) three
basic forms of legitimacy to help clarify the approaches used here. Pragmatic legitimacy (appealing to employees’ self-interested calculations) is pursued by showing early evidence of
the innovation’s value and by allaying employees’ concerns, but such evidence is likely to be
hard to come by in the early stages of implementation. Moral legitimacy (a positive normative
evaluation through consistency with the organization’s value system) is pursued by playing up
how the innovation builds on previous changes
the company has been through and/or that the
organization has a tradition of trying out new
ideas. Finally, cognitive legitimacy (the development of plausible explanations for the innovation that mesh with larger belief systems and
the experienced reality of the audience’s daily
life) is pursued by showing that management
innovation is a necessary solution to a specific
and novel challenge the organization is facing
(Tolbert & Zucker, 1986).
This form of internally focused theorization
and labeling is best performed by internal
change agents because of their existing credibility with employees (Stjernberg & Philips,
1993). It is achieved through a combination of
8

There is also potentially a role for internal change
agents in building legitimacy for external stakeholders, although external change agents typically do this rather more
effectively. We discuss this possibility in the following section.

October

reflective experimenting (whereby the new
practice is interpreted in light of the internal
change agents’ broader body of experience) and
theory linking with external change agents (by
talking to them directly, by reading their books,
or by listening to them speak).
External change agents. The role of external
change agents in the theorization and labeling
phase is twofold. First, they have an important
role to play in building cognitive legitimacy inside the organization, because their status as
independent experts means they are brought
in—for example, as speakers at company
events—to verify both the significance of the
challenge the organization is facing and the validity of the proposed innovation as a response
to that challenge. This form of input is referred
to in Figure 1 as theory linking.
External change agents also play a major role
in building legitimacy for the innovation beyond
the boundaries of the organization. This is often
deemed by the organization to be a worthwhile
activity, because most employees have some
level of awareness of how their organization is
viewed by external constituencies (through customers and outside partners, friends, or the media), so their opinion of the innovation is shaped
to some degree by what external constituencies
say about it. Influential media such as newspapers and magazines have been shown in other
contexts to play an important role in legitimating the actions of individual executives and organizations (Deephouse, 2000; Mazza & Alvarez,
2000; McQuail, 1985; Pollock & Rindova, 2003),
and we would expect them to play an important
role here as an indirect communication channel
through which employees’ attitudes toward the
innovation are shaped.
The externally focused theorization and labeling process involves a set of challenges
different from that of the internally focused
process. The external constituency is typically
management intellectuals, such as senior
leaders in other organizations, journalists,
consultants, and academics (Guillén, 1994).
These individuals operate at a more abstract
level than employees (i.e., they are likely to
focus on management ideas rather than practices), they are more positively disposed toward management innovation than employees
(because they run no personal risk of failure),
and they have a less detailed understanding
of the innovation than employees. As a result

<-----Page 14----->2008

Birkinshaw, Hamel, and Mol

of these differences, the approaches used to
build legitimacy for the innovation to external
audiences are likely to be somewhat different.
Pragmatic legitimacy can only be achieved
vis-à-vis external constituencies by demonstrating that the innovation is yielding valuable outputs. Procter & Gamble claimed, for
example, that the company increased the percentage of new products arising from external
ideas to 40 percent as a result of its Connect
and Develop innovation process (Huston &
Sakkab, 2006). However, such evidence is relatively hard to put together in the early stages
of a management innovation, for the reasons
we have discussed.
Moral legitimacy is pursued by seeking a
positive normative evaluation of the innovation among managerial intellectuals, which
may involve showing how the innovation is
procedurally consistent with existing management practice (e.g., Six Sigma was positioned
as a successor to total quality management;
Harry & Schroeder, 2000), or it may involve
demonstrating the credentials of the organization as a proven high performer with a track
record of innovation. Cognitive legitimacy, in
contrast, is typically pursued by framing the
innovation as a logical solution to one of the
generic challenges or problems that all large
organizations face. In Kieser’s words, “The implementation of the new principles is presented as unavoidable [by management gurus], because the old principles are bound to
fail in the face of the menacing dangers” (1997:
57). This approach is similar to the pursuit of
cognitive legitimacy with employees, except
here the arguments will be expressed in more
abstract or generic terms.
External change agents typically develop
their knowledge of a particular innovation
through prolonged interactions with internal
change agents (through idea-linking, ideatesting, and theory-linking activities) and
through their own reflective theorizing. External
change agents have the skills for contextualizing the innovation in terms of contemporary
business challenges, as well as the necessary
contacts with media organizations. It should be
observed that internal change agents can also
help to build legitimacy for management innovation with external constituencies by writing
articles or books and speaking at conferences.
Although they may lack the theorization skills

839

and personal networks of external change
agents, they have greater credibility through
their personal championing of the process,
which may help to establish the moral legitimacy of the innovation.

DISCUSSION AND AVENUES FOR
FUTURE RESEARCH
Here we have argued that management innovation is an important phenomenon in the
field of management and that the generative
mechanisms through which it occurs (i.e.,
management innovation processes) are theoretically interesting in their own right, and
also relatively poorly understood. We have developed a framework highlighting the important roles of internal and external change
agents in the process and the ways these two
sets of actors interact with one another. Our
framework suggests a number of important
insights, and it opens up some interesting angles for further research.

Sequencing of Management Innovation
Activities
We first observed that the process of management innovation does not always proceed as a
linear sequence of activities from motivation
through to theorization and labeling. For example, an organization that suffers from too much
“smart talk” (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000) may have
several initiatives that are well progressed in
terms of motivation and theorization and labeling, but with no commensurate investment in
invention and implementation. In such a case
the appropriate managerial intervention might
be to focus attention on implementation as a
means of establishing which initiatives are
worth pursuing, whereas other organizational
settings might require different interventions.
However, at the moment we know little about
the relative effectiveness of different sequences
of activities, which makes it difficult to offer any
coherent advice to managers about how to improve the quality of their interventions. Our
framework focuses on the “activities,” such as
trial and error, that take place between the adjacent cells in Table 1 as a means of highlighting that innovation is an iterative process. But
an important next step in making sense of the

<-----Page 15----->840

Academy of Management Review

overall process of management innovation
would be to examine the actual sequencing and
phasing of activities over time. While some innovations may follow a linear sequence of activities from left to right, others do not; for example, Procter & Gamble’s Connect and Develop
program was developed as a concept by its
champion, Larry Huston, long before the company’s CEO articulated the need for it (Birkinshaw
et al., 2007). Likewise, while we would expect
most management innovations to be initiated
primarily by internal change agents, it is possible to identify others, such as T-Groups (Benne,
1964; Blake, 1995), where many of the core activities were driven by external change agents.
Future research should attempt to map out and
make sense of the sequences that actually occur
in practice. The historical record is not particularly helpful in this regard, because writers will
typically impose their own structure on a process in order to make sense of it. Research will
therefore need to be done on contemporary
cases, and, where possible, these cases should
be followed in real time to avoid problems of
retrospective sensemaking bias.
The Role of Internal and External Change
Agents
Another core element of our framework is the
distinction between internal and external
change agents. As a matter of definition, internal change agents are employees of the focal
organization whereas external change agents
are not, which, in turn, implies that internal
change agents will typically have superior
knowledge and networks inside the organization and greater accountability for delivering
results than their external counterparts. However, it is important for future research to consider this distinction more carefully, since it
may not always be clear-cut in practice. Consultants, for example, are sometimes seconded
to their client companies during a change process, and ethnographic researchers will often
become employees in the organizations they are
studying for significant periods of time. In both
cases these external actors actually become internal actors on a temporary basis. Moreover,
there is evidence that some individuals are able
to switch back and forth between internal and
external change agent roles during a single
project (i.e., as action researchers), while others

October

oscillate between the two roles over the course
of their careers (Davenport & Prusak, 2003).
One avenue for further research, then, is to
take a closer look at the key change agents
involved in management innovation and the extent to which they are able to take on hybrid
internal/external roles. A second line of inquiry
might be to consider the extent to which internal
and external change agents are acting in harmony. Here we have assumed that both parties
have a more or less common objective—namely,
to implement a successful management innovation. However, future research might want to
relax this assumption and consider the extent to
which the two parties are truly aligned. For example, in attempting to build legitimacy for a
management innovation among internal and
external constituencies, internal change agents
may downplay the scale of change required to
their colleagues (perhaps by emphasizing consistency with prior norms or a low level of risk)
to make the change more palatable, while external change agents may exaggerate the scale
of the proposed innovation (perhaps by positioning it as the antidote to dramatic changes in the
industry) as a way of generating interest among
external audiences. These differences in positioning can potentially have deleterious consequences for the individuals involved, as well as
for the long-term success of the innovation.
A third avenue for future research that also
builds on the internal versus external distinction is to examine the locus of management innovation. Our framework assumes that it is
possible and meaningful to identify the organization in which a new management practice is
first implemented. While this approach is valid
vis-à-vis the existing cases we mentioned, there
may be cases where it is less valid in the future.
Increasingly, economic activity transpires
through nonfirm networks, such as open-source
software communities, so we can expect innovative ways of organizing to emerge that enable
nonfirm coordination of this type. It is also possible, although less likely, that more management innovations will emerge in vitro in the
future, perhaps through the efforts of academics
rather than the trial and error of practicing managers, in which case the locus of innovation,
again, would not be the organization. Future
studies should therefore give careful attention
to the unit of analysis at which management

<-----Page 16----->2008

innovation is studied, since there are several
possible models that could be followed.
Management Innovation and Management
Fashion
We have argued that the management innovation process is triggered when the market for
fashion fails—that is, when an organization pursues its own novel practice rather than one suggested by the fashion-setting community. However, this argument obscures the important
point that, in many ways, the management fashion process has important similarities to the
management innovation process: both involve
significant roles for internal change agents
(Abrahamson [1996] calls them “users” of management fashions) and external change agents
(“suppliers” of management fashions), as well
as complex interactions between the two. And
both can be framed in evolutionary language—in terms of the introduction of something new to the organization that subsequently
gets selected and retained, or not.
A useful direction for future research, then, will
be to look more closely at how the processes of
management innovation and management fashion interact. It may be possible, for example, to
identify ways in which external change agents,
such as consultants, influence the emergence of
management innovation, either by suppressing
the level of novelty in the focal organization’s chosen solution (e.g., by pushing their own off-theshelf solutions, regardless of the user’s agenda) or
by enhancing it (e.g., by encouraging users to develop their own agendas and by putting forward
ideas with interpretive viability). Another approach might be to examine the conditions under
which a management innovation gets picked up
by the fashion-setting community and turned into
a management fashion. At an abstract level such
practices are likely to have highly “progressive”
and contemporary labels (Abrahamson, 1996) and
are likely to exhibit high levels of external change
agent involvement, but there is room for a much
greater level of clarity on what these conditions
look like in detail.
Management Innovation and Firm Performance
While our focus in this article was primarily on
process issues, questions about why individuals
engage in management innovation and the extent

841

to which management innovation helps organizations to fulfill their goals are equally important. It
seems likely, for example, that certain management innovations will offer more potential for
competitive advantage than others, depending on
the extent to which they are valuable, rare, and
hard to imitate (Barney, 1991), but this argument
remains open to empirical testing.
The consequences of management innovation
are complex, because so many different stakeholders are potentially affected. It is necessary to
separate out at least three different sets of consequences: (1) the impact of management innovation
on various performance metrics inside the innovating firm; (2) the impact on the performance and
legitimacy of subsequent adopters of the innovation; and (3) the benefits of management innovation to society as a whole, in terms of improvements of such things as productivity or quality of
work life. As noted earlier, there has been some
research on the second of these (e.g., Staw & Epstein, 2000), but the first and third remain largely
unexplored. Future research might therefore examine why certain types of management innovation take longer to yield dividends than others,
whether some management innovations spur
waves of related innovation, and how often and
under what circumstances management innovation creates firm-specific competitive advantage.
The Role of Academia in Management
Innovation
Finally, this article offers some initial thoughts
on the role academics can play in the process of
management innovation. Like Abrahamson and
Fairchild (2001), we are concerned that academics
may be losing out to other members of the fashionsetting community, such as consultants and gurus, in terms of their ability to influence practice.
Our framework suggests some possible ways forward. One is for academics to become more creative in the development of new ideas and
thought experiments that organizations might put
into practice. Another is to become more engaged
in the activity we call “idea testing,” whereby the
academic engages closely with the focal organization and brings his or her insight to bear on the
particular problem the organization is grappling
with. This concept of engaged scholarship (Van de
Ven & Johnson, 2006) has a long history, but its
legitimacy as a valid form of scholarship has faltered in recent decades. Another alternative is a

<-----Page 17----->842

Academy of Management Review

management innovation laboratory, such as London Business Schools’ MLab, where researchers
and practitioners come together to develop new
practices in partnership.
These suggestions require further exploration,
both in terms of the nature of the interventions
they would require and in the outcomes they
would achieve. They also challenge many of the
traditional orthodoxies of the profession, in that
they are likely to involve new methodologies
that are unproven and hard to implement. But
we believe they are worth pursuing. A more
active role for management scholars in the process of management innovation would be of
value to innovating organizations, and it would
allow them to reclaim their previously influential role as creators of both new and useful management knowledge.
