Parent-Child Relationships in the First Years
of Immigration to Canada
Dessy Marinova
Research has shown that immigrant children
adapt more rapidly to the new culture than
their parents. In some children, the language
of the dominant culture may fully displace
their native language. In such families, immigrant parents, who have poor knowledge of
the host language, are likely to lose their ability to communicate effectively with their children. Most of the studies have explored acculturation processes in immigrant families with
adolescents, who have resided in North America for a longer time. Hence, studies of earlier
stages of acculturation are essential
because they will provide information on factors that affect parentchild relationships in immigrant
families with younger children.
The purpose of this study was to
examine the impact of the children's
and parents' levels of English proficiency, as well as children's use and
preference for using English at
home, on the dynamics of parent-child relationships in recent immigrant families from
East Asia and Eastern Europe.
We interviewed 183 children and parents from
64 East Asian and Eastern European immigrant families. Children's mean age was 8
years, with equal number of boys and girls in
each group. At the time of the interview, the
families had resided in Canada for three years.
The parents and children independently com-

pleted questionnaires on parent-child relations, the level of English knowledge of the
participating family members, and provided
diary reports of conflicts that occurred in
each parent-child dyad for 2 weeks.
We examined three important qualities of
parent-child relations: egalitarian and warm
relations, parental control and children's and
parents' cooperation in disagreements in each
parent-child dyad.
First, we compared children's and parents'
reports of their English knowledge and exposure. As expected, children's
weekly English exposure and
English proficiency was higher
than that of their parents. Mothers
and fathers did not differ with
respect to their English knowledge.
Second, we constructed models in
which the language measures
predicted different features of parent-child
relations. Here are our findings:
Egalitarian and Warm Relations. We found
that children whose English knowledge was
higher had more warm and egalitarian relations with their parents as per reports of both
children and parents.

Congratulations to Marjan!
Marjan has been a member of the Family Studies lab since 2000,
and successfully defended her Ph.D on October 13th, 2006. Her
dissertation involved investigating the association between the severity of Tourette Syndrome (TS) and overlapping problems such as
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD), and Rage. She also examined the
impact of mothers’ differential treatment of their children, the fairness evaluations of this differential treatment, and communication in
sibling and family relationships. Overall, Marjan found significant
relations among the severity of TS and OCD, ADHD and Rage. Her
study showed that communication about TS between the healthy
siblings and their parents played an important role with respect to sibling relationships, and
was able to confirm previous findings about mothers’ differential treatment and the role of
fairness evaluations in predicting sibling relationships. Please join us in wishing Marjan the
best of luck with her new career!

<-----Page 1----->Parent-Child Relationships ... (continued from page 1)
In mother-child dyads, children who used
and preferred to use English less often
had warmer, more egalitarian relationships with their parents.
Parental Controlling Behavior. Children
perceived their mothers as more controlling when children and mothers experienced less gap in their English knowledge (i.e., their English knowledge was
either high or low). However, when children's English knowledge was high and
their mothers' English knowledge was
low (as well as vice versa) they perceived
their mothers as less controlling. Children's reports about their fathers' controlling behavior did not yield any significant
effects.
Fathers whose English knowledge was
lower perceived themselves as more controlling when their children's proficiency
was high; conversely, fathers' controlling

behavior decreased at either high or
low levels of English proficiency of
both children and fathers.
Children's and Parents' Cooperation
in Disagreements with one another.
Children perceived their mothers as
more constructive negotiators when
their mothers' English proficiency was
high, and children themselves reported
less use and preference for using English at home. Children who tended to
show less use and preference for using
English at home were more cooperative
with their mothers during disagreements with them as per their mothers'
reports. According to the fathers, children who reported low use and preference for using English at home but had
higher levels of English proficiency
showed more cooperation in disagreements with them.

Conclusion. This study has shown that
the children's and parents' English
knowledge and children's use and preference for using English at home play an
important role in parent-child relations.
We hope that these findings will have
implications for designing programs to
help parents and children adjust better to
Canada.
In the upcoming year, we will analyze
the results from diaries of parent-child
conflict kept by our study families. We
would like to examine what qualities of
parent-child relations lead to successful
conflict resolution between parents and
children. In immigrant families, we
would like to further explore whether
concordant use of either English or their
native language plays a role in parentchild disagreements and their outcomes.

Cross-Cultural Sibling Negotiation
Katie Lam
Canadians often
have the privilege
to get a taste of a
variety of the
world’s cultures
without having to
travel too far.
Whether it is
attending a multicultural night in
the community,
or enjoying an authentic ethnic meal at a
restaurant, Canadians are known for their
celebration of multiculturalism. This
racial and ethnic diversity has also made
Canada an ideal place for cross-cultural
research, which has proliferated recently
as psychologists begin to acknowledge
the significant impact cultures have in
influencing the way individuals interpret
and react to their daily experiences.
In taking advantage of Canada’s diversity, over the past year I conducted a
study to examine the differences between
European-Canadian and Chinese young
sibling pairs (ages 3 to 9) in their negotiation behaviours when confronted with
Page 2

a conflict of interest. Specifically, I
asked the siblings to divide five toys
between themselves that they could
take home afterwards. Through this
process, I tried to determine whether
children differed in the ways they negotiate as well as the final solutions
that they achieved depending on their
cultural backgrounds. Several significant cultural differences were found:
• European-Canadian and Chinese
children did not differ in individualistic and collectivistic behaviours;
rather, older siblings from both cultures consistently demonstrated
greater consideration of their siblings’ preferences.
• Chinese children more often expressed their desires in indirect
ways such as offering specific toys
to their siblings or commenting on
the general interests of themselves
or of their siblings; EuropeanCanadian children more often expressed their preferences directly.
• Chinese children were more likely

to deal with multiple toys simultaneously; European-Canadian children
usually focused on one toy at a time.
• European-Canadian pairs most often
resolved to share one or more of the
toys.

<-----Page 2----->Supervised Access in Conflict Families
Courtney Tario
Supervised access is a safe setting that
allows interaction between children and
non-custodial parents. Supervised access programs have no contact policies
between the parents, thus
preventing overt conflict
between parents. This program is available in two
forms: exchanges and visits. The exchanges allow
the non-custodial parent a
set amount of time with the
child outside of the center.
The visits allow the noncustodial parent a set
amount of time in the center under the
supervision of a worker.
For my Honours Thesis last year under
the supervision of Dr. Hildy Ross, I
evaluated Child and Parent Place
(CAPP), a supervised access center that
is a part of Lutherwood-Coda in Waterloo, Cambridge and Guelph. The general aim was to examine 1) relationships among members of high conflict
divorcing or separated families, 2) how

these family members feel about using
supervised access, and 3) how family
relationships relate to feelings about
using supervised access.

CAPP and on average children reported
positive relationships with parents. The
following is a brief summary of the
factors that relate to liking CAPP.

Participants in this study
were 33 families using
Child and Parent Place; 29
custodial parents, 28 noncustodial parents, and 20
children. Parents were given
a questionnaire and children
were also interviewed using
a similar questionnaire.

1. The custodial parents report their
children like CAPP if
a) the children like the noncustodial parents and
b) the custodial parents are not
quarrelsome with their children.

The most common reason
for divorce from the custodial parents
was abuse and marital breakdown from
the non-custodial parents. On average,
the better the relationship between custodial parents and children, the worse
the relationship between non-custodial
parents and children. The less frustration between parents, the better the
relationship between children and noncustodial parents.

2. The non-custodial parents report the
children like CAPP if
a) the non-custodial parents like
CAPP and
b) the non-custodial parents do not
like the custodial parents.
3. The custodial parents like CAPP if
a) they report their children like
CAPP and
b) the children were quarrelsome
with their custodial parents.

Most children reported they liked

Study to Launch: Conflicts in ’Hard to Manage’ Children
Marci Gordeyko
My doctoral research will examine peer
conflict negotiations in typically developing and ‘hard to manage’ 7-year-old
children. ‘Hard to manage’ children are
reported to have more conduct problems by their parents and teachers.
‘Hard to manage’ children are also
more likely to experience problems
understanding the viewpoints or perspectives of others, and in their ability
to form positive peer relationships. If
‘hard to manage’ children are developmentally delayed in understanding others’ viewpoints, they may not be able
to use this ability when attempting to
resolve conflict with their peers.
To investigate this, we will use procedures that have been successful in our
own work with siblings. Children will
be shown a number of toys and told
that they may take a toy home, if they
can divide the toys between their peer

and themselves. Avigail Ram's study
showed that when siblings provide one
another with information
about the toys they most
desire, they are better able
to reach resolutions that
maximize positive outcomes. Children who are
better able to understand
what their peer wants may
also be more successful in
negotiating who will receive each toy. Children who are ‘hard
to manage’ are expected to resolve
their differences less often than typically developing children in part because they know less about the
perspectives of others.

portant socialization tool but ‘hard to
manage’ children tend to lack in their
ability to have close friendships. This could be because of a delay in perspective taking ability.
Additionally, ‘hard to manage’ children’s’ deficits in
interpersonal relations may
also be influenced by the
reactions of their peers to
their difficult behaviours.
If we can determine the specific underlying reasons for ‘hard to manage’ children’s problems with peer relationships, we may be able to better understand how to help them in their struggles with conflict resolution and social
interactions in general.

This research is important in order to
understand the conflict resolution abilities of ‘hard to manage’ children. Peer
relations have been found to be an imPage 3

Cross-Cultural…
(continued from page 2)
• Some Chinese pairs (and no European-Canadian pairs) were able to
take full advantage of the differences in their initial preferences and
divide the toys accordingly; however, in most cases, the Chinese
siblings simply divided the toys
without achieving this best possible
solution.

At the Family Studies Lab, we are
investigating the effects of parental
intervention on the resolution of sibling
conflicts. Parents have the opportunity
to have a short discussion with their
children about an ongoing problem.
Children answer questions about past
conflicts and good times with their sibling.

In all, this research substantiates that
cultural differences can appear by early
childhood as a result of parents’ socialization. Findings from crosscultural research have particular implications to the Canadians, as we often
interact and associate with others who
may not share the same culture. Toward this end, more research will be
needed in the future to further our understanding about the extent that culture can affect children’s behaviour.

Families Needed!
Do you know a family with 2 children
between the ages of 5 and 10?
The Family Studies Lab is currently conducting a study on sibling conflict. We
are still looking for families to participate
in the research.
As a token of our appreciation, the children will receive gifts and the family will
also be reimbursed with $50 for their
participation.
If you know a family that may be interested in participating, we would appreciate the referral. Consider the possibility,
and contact Kristi Baerg at the Family
Studies Lab for further information:
