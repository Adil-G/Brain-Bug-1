Abstract
The results of this study provide insight into why some universities generate more new companies to exploit their intellectual
property than do others. We compare four different explanations for cross-institutional variation in new firm formation rates
from university technology licensing offices (TLOs) over the 1994–1998 period—the availability of venture capital in the
university area; the commercial orientation of university research and development; intellectual eminence; and university
policies. The results show that intellectual eminence, and the policies of making equity investments in TLO start-ups and
maintaining a low inventor’s share of royalties increase new firm formation. The paper discusses the implications of these
results for university and public policy.

1. Introduction
New firms founded to exploit university-assigned
intellectual property (TLO start-ups) have become an
important economic phenomenon. Roughly 12% of
university-assigned inventions are transferred to the
private sector through the founding of new organizations (Association of University Technology Managers, 1998). TLO start-ups are also disproportionately
successful start-up firms. Of the 2578 technology licensing office (TLO) start-ups that have been founded
since 1980, 70% are still in operation (Association of
University Technology Managers, 1998). Moreover,

research on the TLO start-ups from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) indicates that roughly
20% of these companies experience an initial public
offering (Shane and Stuart, 2002). In fact, several major corporations had their origins as TLO start-ups,
including Genentech in biotechnology, Cirrus Logic
in semiconductors, and Lycos in Internet search engines. Thus, across universities, TLO start-ups are
both an important vehicle of technology transfer, and
an important mechanism for economic activity.
However, the frequency of TLO start-up activity
varies significantly across universities. Some universities, like MIT, routinely transfer their technology
through the formation of new firms, while other universities, like Columbia University, rarely generate
start-ups. Moreover, rates of start-up activity are not
a simple function of the magnitude of sponsored research funding or the quantity of inventions created.
For example, Stanford University, with sponsored research expenditures of US$ 391 million generated 25
TLO start-ups in 1997; whereas Duke University, with

sponsored research expenditures of US$ 361 million,
generated none. To date we have no systematic explanation for why some universities generate more new
companies to exploit their intellectual property than
do others.
Explaining cross-school variation in start-up activity is important for at least four reasons. First, university inventions are an important source of knowledge
spillovers (Jaffe, 1989), and understanding the different mechanisms by which knowledge from different
universities spills over is important to understanding
technology creation and economic growth. Second,
TLO start-ups tend to locate geographically close
to the institutions that spawn them,2 making them
valuable entities for local economic development
and agglomeration economies (Zucker et al., 1998).
Third, successful TLO start-ups generate significant
wealth through initial public offerings, and university inventors and provosts are interested in capturing
this wealth. Fourth, university entrepreneurs make
different decisions from non-entrepreneurs, leading
the creation of TLO start-ups to generate important
questions about university norms and policies toward
research, teaching, and knowledge disclosure (Cohen
et al., 1998; Brooks and Randazzese, 1998).
In this paper, we explore empirically why some
universities generate more TLO start-ups than do others. In specific, we examine the number of companies
founded to exploit university-assigned intellectual
property across 101 US universities over the 1994–
1998 period. We investigate four different arguments for cross-institution variation in start-up rates:
university policies, local venture capital activity,
the commercial orientation of university research,
and intellectual eminence. We find that two university policies—making equity investments in lieu of
patent and licensing costs, and the inventor share of
royalties—and the university’s intellectual eminence
influence TLO start-up rates. We find no effect of
local venture capital activity and only limited support for an effect of the commercial orientation of
university research on TLO start-up rates.
This article proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents
the four explanations for why some universities

reports that 79% of the 364 TLO start-ups in 1998 were founded
in the state in which the licensing institution is located.

generate more TLO start-ups than others do. Section 3
describes the methodology for the study. Section 4
presents the results. Section 5 presents a discussion
and conclusions.

2. The different explanations
TLO start-ups are created when the licensee of a
university-assigned invention creates a new company
to exploit it. Both micro and macro-level factors influence the decision to create a new company to exploit a
university invention. At the micro-level, research has
shown that the attributes of technological inventions
themselves (Shane, 2001a), inventors’ career experience (Levin and Stephan, 1991; Shane and Khurana,
2000), their psychological make-up (Roberts, 1991),
and their research skills (Zucker et al., 1998) influence this decision. At the macro-level, research has
shown that technology regimes (Shane, 2001b), the
strength of patent protection in a line of business
(Shane, 2002), and universities’ intellectual property
(Goldfarb et al., 2001) and human resource policies
(Kenney, 1986) influence this decision. Although both
micro- and macro-level factors influence the tendency
of people to start new firms to exploit university inventions, we do not discuss micro-level factors in this
study. The goal of the paper is to examine the effect
macro-level factors that vary across universities over
time on the rate at which new firms are created to
exploit university inventions rather than to develop an
overall behavioral model of the decision to found a
firm to exploit university inventions.
Prior research suggests four macro-level explanations for cross-university variation in TLO start-up
activity. First, universities located in geographic
areas rich in venture capital could be more likely
generate TLO start-ups because the abundance of
venture capital makes resource acquisition easier
for entrepreneurs. Second, universities that conduct
industry-funded research could be more likely to
generate TLO start-ups because they are more likely
than other universities to make commercially-oriented
discoveries. Third, universities that are more intellectually eminent could be more likely to generate
TLO start-ups because intellectual eminence allows
schools to produce new technologies of actual or perceived higher quality. Fourth, universities that adopt

<-----Page 2----->D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

certain policies could generate more TLO start-ups
because those policies provide greater incentives
for entrepreneurial activity. In Sections 2.1–2.4, we
develop each of these explanations.
2.1. Venture capital
The first argument for cross-university variation
in TLO start-up activity is the availability of venture
capital in the area. Venture capitalists play an important role in the innovation process by providing risk
capital and operating assistance to new high technology firms (Florida and Kenney, 1988). In fact, venture
capital plays a particularly important role in financing
university start-ups because it is a major source of
funds for new firms in fields in which universities are
a major source of new technology, like biotechnology
(Zucker et al., 1998).
Because formal venture capital is a major source
of equity financing for new technology companies,
its availability is important to overcoming capital
market barriers to the financing of new technology
firms. In addition, venture capitalists serve as “market
makers” in a “spot market” for business development
resources by connecting new technology companies
with potential suppliers, customers, lawyers, manufacturers, and employees (Florida and Kenney, 1988).
Finally, venture capitalists provide valuable operating
assistance to new technology companies that help
those companies to grow and compete.
Venture capital investments tend to be made locally.
Moral hazard problems pervade the financing of new
technology companies (Sahlman, 1990). Uncertainty
and information asymmetry make entrepreneurs privy
to information that investors do not have, so it is
important for venture capitalists to closely monitor
their investments in new companies. Because interpersonal interaction provides a central mechanism
for disseminating information, and this interaction
is enhanced by physical interaction and inspection
(Sorenson and Stuart, 2001), geographical proximity
lowers the cost of monitoring new ventures (Gompers
and Lerner, 1999; Gupta and Sapienza, 1992; Lerner,
1995; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001).
Second, to link new technology companies with
potential suppliers and customers, venture capitalists
rely on networks of contacts. These networks are
more easily developed and maintained in a localized

211

geographic area (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001). As a
result, efforts to provide new ventures with ties to important stakeholders are facilitated by geographically
localized investing.
Third, the provision of operational assistance to
new technology companies is enhanced by physical
proximity to investment targets (Gupta and Sapienza,
1992). Venture capitalists spend between 4 and 5 h
per month on the site of the companies in which they
invest, and activities with portfolio companies account for half of a venture capitalist’s time (Gorman
and Sahlman, 1989). Because travel time reduces the
number of ventures with which an investor can interact, geographically localized investing increases the
amount of operational assistance that a venture capital
firm can make. Moreover, the quality of assistance that
venture capitalists can offer start-ups decreases with
geographical distance (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001).
Several studies have provided empirical support
for the geographical localization of venture capital
investments (Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Gupta and
Sapienza, 1992; Lerner, 1995; Sorenson and Stuart,
2001). In particular, Sorenson and Stuart (2001) find
that the probability that a venture capital firm will
invest in a start-up decreases with the geographical
distance between the headquarters of the venture capital firm and the start-up firm—the rate of investment
in companies 10 miles from a venture capitalist’s
headquarters is double that in companies located
100 miles away. Similarly, Lerner (1995) finds that
geographic proximity influences the composition of
the boards of directors of venture capital-backed
start-ups—venture capital firms headquartered within
5 miles of a start-up’s location are twice as likely to
be on the company’s board of directors as venture
capital firms headquartered 500 miles away.
Evolutionary patterns of regional development,
combined with resource endowments, have created
different distributions of venture capital in different
geographical locations (Lerner, 1995). The vast majority of venture capital in the US is located in a small
number of locations like Silicon Valley and Route 128
(Florida and Kenney, 1988). If entrepreneurs use venture capital to found new high technology companies
to exploit university inventions, and venture capitalists make geographically constrained investments,
then the availability of venture capital in a locality
should influence the rate of TLO start-up activity. This

<-----Page 3----->212

D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

argument suggests that, ceteris paribus, the greater the
availability of venture capital in the university area,
the greater the rate of TLO start-up activity.

the university, the greater the rate of TLO start-up
activity.4,5
2.3. Intellectual eminence

2.2. Commercially-oriented research
The second argument for cross-university variation
in TLO start-up activity is the commercial orientation of university research. Universities differ on the
degree to which their researchers focus on industrial
problems. Some universities (perhaps because of their
state affiliations or their historical involvement with
agricultural or industry extension services) focus their
research more closely on the needs of industry than do
other universities. The commercial orientation of university research is reflected in the source of funding for
that research. Commercially-oriented universities receive more of their research budget from industry than
do other universities (Rosenberg and Nelson, 1994).
The tendency of a university to conduct industryfunded research and development should increase its
TLO start-up rate for three reasons. First, industry
tends to fund more commercially-oriented research
than the government, and a commercial orientation
should increase the likelihood of discovering technologies that have sufficient commercial value for people
to found companies.
Second, industry tends to fund less risky research
than the government funds (Arrow, 1962). More
risky research is more problematic for firm formation
because single technology new companies cannot
exploit the economies of scope in technology development that allow large firms to diversify these risks
(Nelson, 1959).
Third, being more basic, government-funded
research tends to suffer from greater information
asymmetry problems than does industry-funded research. Because entrepreneurs obtain money through
market-mediated transactions,3 information asymmetry problems result in failures in venture finance markets. Thus, information asymmetry problems make it
less likely that entrepreneurs will be able to finance
companies to commercialize government-funded
research than industry funded research. The above arguments suggest that, ceteris paribus, the greater the
amount of commercially-oriented research activity at

They lack positive cash flow from existing operations.

The third argument for cross-university variation
in TLO start-up activity is university eminence. Two
different variants of the eminence explanation have
been suggested in the literature. The first argument is
that better quality researchers are more likely to start
firms to exploit their inventions than lesser quality researchers; and, on average, higher quality researchers
are found in more eminent universities. In some fields,
university entrepreneurs found companies to capture
the rents to their intellectual capital (Zucker et al.,
1998). Because this intellectual capital is tacit, and
belongs to a small set of leading researchers, inventors
must become entrepreneurs to exploit it. More eminent schools are more likely to employ leading-edge
researchers than are less eminent schools. Therefore,
the founding of companies to capture rents to intellectual capital will be more common at more eminent
schools than at less eminent institutions.
The second argument is that the university’s prestige or reputation makes it easier for researchers from
more eminent universities to start companies to exploit
their inventions than researchers from less eminent
universities. Obtaining the resources necessary to establish a technology company requires entrepreneurs
to persuade resource providers to give them money
under conditions of information asymmetry and
4 Readers should note that an alternative argument could be
made—the rate of TLO start-ups is inversely proportional to the
commercial orientation of university research funding. When a
company contributes research funds, it sometimes obtains the right
of first refusal to license any discoveries that come from that research. As a result, more industry funding could lead to fewer
start-ups because it leads the university to license a greater proportion of its inventions back to the firms that fund the research.
5 In our regressions to predict the effect of the commercial orientation of university research on the rate of TLO start-up activity, we control for the number of inventions produced in the
university-year. This control is important because new firm formation might depend on the attributes of technological inventions
themselves (Shane, 2001), rather than on university orientation. As
a result, the number of commercially-oriented inventions, rather
than the university’s commercial orientation might drive the TLO
start-up rate. By partialling out the effect of the number of inventions in regression analysis, we can examine the effect of commercial orientation net of the effect of the number of inventions.

<-----Page 4----->D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

uncertainty. Because information problems preclude
investors from completely evaluating the technology
under question, investors often make their evaluation
of entrepreneurs and their ideas on the basis of perceived signals of quality. One signal that investors use
is the intellectual eminence of the researchers and the
institution spawning the venture (Podolny and Stuart,
1995). Investors believe, rightly or wrongly, that more
eminent universities produce technology that is more
worthy of funding than less eminent universities, and
therefore encourage greater firm formation from more
eminent institutions. Both variants of the intellectual
eminence argument suggest that, ceteris paribus, the
greater the intellectual eminence of the university, the
greater the rate of TLO start-up activity.
2.4. University policies
The fourth argument for cross-university variation
in TLO start-up activity is that universities differ in
their policies toward technology transfer and that
those policies shift activities at the margin toward or
away from start-up activity. In particular, previous
researchers have suggested the importance of four
different policies.
First, the distribution of royalty rates between inventors and the university could influence the propensity
of entrepreneurs to found firms to exploit university inventions. Universities typically earn profits from their
inventions through royalties on the gross sales from licensing that technology. Universities have policies that
divide these profits between inventors and the university. This arrangement means that inventors can earn
profits from their inventions either from royalties paid
by licensees, or from the profits (net of royalties) made
from commercializing the technology themselves.6
The dual nature of potential inventor compensation from invention creates an inverse relationship
between royalties and incentives for inventors to
found firms. Assuming constant licensing rates across
6 This argument assumes that the inventor’s royalty is not differentially affected by licensing negotiations between the university and the licensing firm, and that that the inventor’s income
is not differentially affected by the size of after-license consulting contracts, when the licensee is an inventor start-up and when
the licensee is an independent entity. Because the current research
project cannot examine this assumption, future research should
consider its veracity.

213

different licensees for particular types of technology,
the inventor’s earnings will increase with his or her
share of the royalties if the technology is licensed to
an existing firm. In contrast, if the inventor starts a
company, his or her earnings will not increase with his
or her share of the royalties. Therefore, the greater the
inventor’s share of the royalties, the greater the opportunity cost of starting a firm to exploit the technology, and the lower the incentive to seek profits from
an invention by founding a firm. Therefore, ceteris
paribus, the size of the inventor’s share of royalties
should be inversely related to the TLO start-up rate.
Second, the use of incubators could influence the
cost of start-up activity. Most university technologies
are embryonic and development on them is necessary
before they can be sold in the market place (Jensen
and Thursby, 2002). Incubators allow entrepreneurs to
“ripen” technologies in close proximity to inventors
whose inputs are useful for further development. In
addition, incubators reduce the cost of development
through subsidies and sharing of general administrative costs. Therefore, ceteris paribus, the use of incubators should increase the TLO start-up rate.
Third, the use of internal venture capital funds
could make the acquisition of capital easier for TLO
start-ups. Venture capitalists are more likely to invest
in companies that are referred to them by colleagues
or that are founded by people that they know because
these ties provide investors with information that mitigates the information asymmetry problems inherent
in financing new technology companies (Sorenson
and Stuart, 2001).
However, most university personnel are not members of the information networks of venture capitalists. Their focus on research and teaching does not
require interaction with venture capitalists, but instead requires interaction with other economic actors.
Because university administrators with whom university personnel interact administer university venture
capital funds, potential university entrepreneurs are
more likely to have direct or indirect connections to
the administrators of university venture capital funds
than to general venture capitalists. These connections
facilitate the flow of information about the potential
entrepreneurs and mitigate the information asymmetry problems in venture finance. Therefore, ceteris
paribus, the presence of internal venture capital funds
should increase the TLO start-up rate.

<-----Page 5----->214

Fourth, a university’s willingness to take an equity
stake in TLO start-ups in exchange for paying patenting, marketing, or other up-front costs could facilitate
the formation of start-up companies. Unlike established firms, new firms lack cash flow from existing
operations, making them cash constrained. University
equity investments made in lieu of paying patent costs
or up-front license fees reduce the cash expenditures
of new firms, facilitating firm formation (Hsu and
Bernstein, 1997). Therefore, ceteris paribus, the willingness of a university to make equity investments in
TLO start-ups should increase the TLO start-up rate.

3. Methodology
In this section, we describe the sample and variables
included in the analysis, and provide an overview of
the analytical methods we employed.
3.1. Sample
Universities regularly retain the right to intellectual property generated by faculty and staff, leading
university technology licensing offices to track the
life histories of the intellectual property that they
create. Because of the interest of universities in tracking their intellectual property, university technology
licensing offices are aware of virtually all start-up
firms that are created to exploit university intellectual
property.
The Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), a professional association governed
by and for TLO officers, annually surveys university
technology licensing offices to obtain information
pertaining to patenting, licensing, and start-up firm
activity, as well as information on funding, staffing,
and certain policies. AUTM has collected data pertaining to start-up activity since 1994. Because we
use panel data analysis techniques, we gathered data
on start-up activity from 1994 to 1998 for the 116
universities for which 2 or more years of TLO start-up
data are available from AUTM.
We seek to examine the effect of university policies on the start-up rates. We define a university in
our analysis as an entity that operates under a single set of policy rules. Therefore, we aggregated
data from multi-campus universities into a single

annual observation for the university,7 except when
the different campuses employed distinct policies and
procedures and maintained independent TLOs.8
Although the dependent variable of interest, TLO
start-up activity, was obtained from the AUTM survey, the data for predictor and control variables were
obtained from a variety of sources, including venture capital databases, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) database, and a survey
administered to TLO directors. To obtain information
regarding university policies from 1994 to 1998, we
surveyed the 116 universities in our sample by both
e-mail and telephone. We asked the TLO directors to
indicate their policies for each year from 1994 to 1998.
Of the universities surveyed, 101 responded, providing a response rate exceeding 87%. We compared
respondents to non-respondents in terms of patenting and start-up activity and found no statistically
significant differences at the P < 0.10 level. The
non-respondents provided a variety of idiosyncratic
reasons for not participating (e.g. some do not participate in surveys as a matter of policy, while others
had experienced turnover and were unable to provide
historical information regarding policies). Therefore,
we are confident that non-response to our policy
questions does not hinder our analysis.
The sample for our analysis is restricted to the
101 universities that are both in the AUTM database
and responded to our survey. Because some universities report start-up data for only some years, our
sample consists of 457 university-year observations.
However, the sample includes of 89 of the 100 top
US universities in R&D volume, and accounts for
approximately 85% of all US patents issued to universities, based on statistics maintained by the USPTO.
Although the exact number of TLO start-ups is unknown, the sample appears to account for the vast
majority of the population of such firms, and selection
bias does not hinder our analysis of the data.9
7 The AUTM licensing data is most often reported at the level
of the university system. It is not possible to examine campuses
of the same system separately.
8 Although most state medical schools share a single TLO with
the state university, we consider three state medical schools separate institutions due to their distinct policies and administration.
9 It is important to note that the sample represents the population
of universities that generate inventions. It does not represent the
population of US educational institutions.

<-----Page 6----->D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

To gather data on venture capital activities in
different locations, we examined the Venture Economics database, administered by Thomson Financial
Services. The Venture Economics database is the
leading source of data on venture capital activity in
the US (Gompers and Lerner, 1999).
To gather data on intellectual eminence, we utilized
the assessment score for overall graduate school quality reported in the Gourman Reports (Gourman, 1994,
1997), a widely used assessment of graduate and
professional degree programs. The Gourman Report
assessment incorporates the perceived and actual quality of a university’s graduate programs in medicine,
engineering, business, physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, and other fields into a single
measure of graduate school quality.10 The measure
is derived from an assessment of several factors that
are believed to influence graduate school quality, including the caliber of faculty, adequacy of facilities,
breadth of curriculum, funding levels, and research
productivity.
Lastly, we obtained patent data by searching
the on-line database of US patents maintained by
United States Patent and Trademark Office. For each
university-year, we performed a search of the name
of the university and/or foundation designated by the
university as the assignee for its intellectual property.
We then tabulated the total number of patents in each
university-year. The results of our search correlated
at 0.95 with the self-reported patent data provided by
the universities to AUTM.
3.2. Dependent variable
The dependent variable is a count of the number of
TLO start-ups from a given university in a given year.
3.3. Predictor variables
3.3.1. Venture capital availability
To measure the effects of venture capital availability
on the TLO start-up rate, we examined four measures
10 We also examined regressions that substituted the engineering
school ranking for the overall ranking. The results are substantively
the same as those with the overall rankings. We do not report the
analysis with the engineering school rankings because the sample
size is reduced by 21 universities that do not offer graduate degrees
in engineering.

215

of local venture capital: the number of local companies
receiving funding from venture capitalists in a given
year; the amount of venture capital funding received
by local firms in a given year; the number of local
venture capital funds in a given year; and the amount
of funding provided by local venture capital funds in a
given year.11,12,13 We defined local venture capital as
the amount of activity occurring in all telephone area
code zones within 60 miles of the each university.14
Area codes were used to delineate geographic areas in order to avoid errors of inclusion or omission
that would be likely to occur by defining regions by
state.
3.3.2. Commercially-oriented research
To measure if the commercial orientation of university research increased the TLO start-up rate, we
examined the proportion of each university’s sponsored research budget in a given year that was industry
funded.15 Because overall magnitude may be more
important than percentage allocation, in an alternative
specification, we measured commercial orientation as
the dollar value of industry funding, while controlling
for government funding. We gathered these data from
the AUTM licensing survey.
3.3.3. Intellectual eminence
To measure if university eminence increased the
TLO start-up rate, we examined the overall academic
rating score of graduate schools published in the
Gourman Reports (Gourman, 1994, 1997). Because
this survey is produced every 3 years, we update the
scores in 1994 and 1997. Three medical schools in the
11 We do not lag the independent variables because we expect
that the current year independent variables, rather than past year
independent variables, influence the start-up decision.
12 In our regression analysis, we use the number of local companies receiving venture capital funding in a given year as our primary measure and treat the other measures as tests of robustness
in other regressions.
13 Because the venture capital measures are non-normally distributed, we also examined natural log and square root transformations. The results for the transformed variables are qualitatively
the same as those for the untransformed variables. We report the
untransformed variables for ease of interpretation.
14 The area code was available for approximately 85% of the
data in the database.
15 Prior research shows that this proportion captures the university
tendency to conduct applied research (Henderson et al., 1998).

sample do not offer graduate degrees in fields outside
of health sciences, and therefore did not receive overall graduate school scores in the Gourman Report.
For these universities, we used the scores for their
medical schools in our regression analysis. In unreported regressions, we examined the data excluding
the three problematic institutions. We find that their
inclusion or exclusion does not qualitatively alter the
results.
3.3.4. University licensing policies: the inventor
share of royalties
To measure if royalty policies influenced the TLO
start-up rate, we examined the inventor’s share of
royalties from technology licensing. The inventors of
technologies licensed by universities receive royalties based on a rate that is virtually always explicitly
stated in published university policies. The percent of
royalties distributed to inventors may be constant, as
is the case in the majority of universities included in
our sample, or may be established on a sliding scale
that typically decreases according to the amount of
royalties received by the university. We contend the
distribution rate affects start-up activity by altering the
perceived opportunity cost of an inventor. Because the
inventor’s share of royalty rates sometimes forms a
range that is affected by the outcome of the license (i.e.
declining or increasing percentages as sales increase),
inventors cannot know ex ante the exact share of royalties that they will receive. Therefore, in our primary
analysis, we use the minimum percent of total royalties
distributed to inventors as an indicator of the perceived
opportunity cost. In alternative regressions, we measured the distribution of royalties by the amount of royalties an inventor would receive on a patent that yields
US$ 1 million in royalties for the university. While this
amount clearly exceeds the average amount of royalties received for university patents, inventors are most
likely to start a firm to exploit their technology when
they believe their invention has better-than-average
prospects.
3.3.5. University licensing policies: incubators
To measure if the presence of incubators influenced
the TLO start-up rate, we examined whether or not
TLO start-ups had access to technology incubators.
University officials often argue that they can enhance
the start-up rate out of their TLOs by using incubator

facilities to foster new companies. In some instances,
university incubators may be independently operated,
but work jointly with the university. In other cases,
the incubators may be units of the university.16 In our
survey, we asked the TLO directors whether or not
the university provided access to either type of incubator for TLO start-up firms during each year from
1994 to 1998. We included a dummy variable of one
for the university-year in our regression analysis if
the response was affirmative.
3.3.6. University licensing policies: equity policies
and practices
To measure if equity policies influenced the TLO
start-up rate, we examined whether or not the TLO
could make an equity investment in TLO start-ups.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that a university policy
of making an equity investment in lieu of requiring
reimbursement of patenting and licensing expenses
will enhance the university start-up rate by reducing
capital constraints on firm formation. We measured
this practice through the use of a dummy variable of
one in the university-year if the information provided
by each university to AUTM indicated that the university took an equity stake in at least one licensee in any
prior year.
We also tested an alternative measure of equity
policies derived from the surveys we sent to TLO
directors. We asked the TLO directors whether or
not their university was permitted to take an equity
stake in licensees of university intellectual property
for each of the years covered in the study. This indicator variable took a value of one if the university’s
policies did not explicitly prohibit the university
from taking an equity stake in a licensee in a given
year.
3.3.7. University licensing policies: venture capital
investment by universities
To measure if university venture capital funds influenced the TLO start-up rate, we asked TLO directors to
indicate whether or not their universities were permitted to make venture capital investments in licensees of
university technologies. We include a dummy variable
16 As an indicator variable, this measure does not account for
variation in size, funding, and quality of assistance among incubators.

<-----Page 8----->D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

of one if the university is permitted to make venture
capital investments in licensees in a given year.17
3.4. Control variables
3.4.1. Number of inventions
Because we expect that the number of TLO start-ups
would be related to the number of inventions produced by the university, we control for the production
of technology in three different ways. First, we examine the number of patents issued to the university in
the year under investigation. Second, we examine the
number of invention disclosures in the university-year.
Third, we examine the number of licenses and option agreements signed in the university-year.18 We
examine each of these measures of inventive output
(in different regressions) because each measure has
advantages and disadvantages. Invention disclosures
capture the overall inventive activity at a university,
whether or not those inventions are of interest to
firms. Invention disclosures are also less biased by the
patentability of inventions in different types of technology (e.g. software should generate fewer patents
per invention than will drugs), than patents. However,
universities have different rules about invention disclosures, making them more subject to institutional
variation in their measurement than patents, which
must meet the same federal requirements. In addition,
some universities pre-screen potential inventions and
encourage inventors to disclose only if they believe
that the inventions are patentable.19
Unlike invention disclosures and patents, licenses
and option agreements capture the production of tech17 The venture capital investment variable reflects the explicit
policies of universities. It is also correlated with the previous
variable, equity investment, because a university must first be
able to take an equity stake in a licensee (i.e. a passive form of
investment) in order to make a direct venture capital investment
in the licensee.
18 We also examined the number of patent applications in place
of the number of patents issued. The results are substantively the
same with patent applications as with patents issued.
19 We also explored whether lagging patent applications and invention disclosures changes the effects of these variables. The
results are substantively the same when we lag each of these variables by 2 years. Because we do not know the actual lag between
invention disclosure or patent application and start-up, the length
of the time lag we selected was arbitrary. Therefore, we report
the regression analyses with the unlagged variables.

217

nology that is of interest to the private sector. By controlling for licensing agreements, rather than invention
disclosures or patents, we can measure the frequency
of start-up activity, ruling out the possibility that we
are simply capturing the commercial value of different schools’ inventive output. As a result, using this
control for inventive output, we capture the idea that
there are many inventions that are not of interest to
the private sector, and that there are routes to commercialization other than start-ups.
The invention disclosure and licensing data were
derived from the AUTM surveys, while patent data
were obtained from the United States Patent and
Trademark Office database.
3.4.2. Number of technology licensing office staff
The assistance in technology transfer that entrepreneurs require may exceed that required by established companies. In addition, licensing contracts with
start-ups often involve exclusive licensing (Jensen
and Thursby, 2002), and the negotiations for such
contracts may be more time intensive. Therefore, we
control for the number of technology licensing office
staff, measured in full-time equivalencies (FTEs).
3.4.3. Sponsored research expenditures
Because the intellectual property exploited by TLO
start-ups is created through investment in research, the
amount of research inputs is likely related to start-up
rates. Therefore, we control for the amount of sponsored research expenditures in the university-year.
We control for total sponsored research funding, except in a model that includes industry funding (rather
than industry funding as a percent of total funding)
as a predictor variable. In the latter case, we control
for the total amount of government funding.20 We
gather these data from information reported by the
universities to AUTM.
3.4.4. Year dummy variables
Patenting and start-up activity is significantly higher
in 1997 and 1998 than in other years. To account for
annual variations in patenting and start-up activity, we
20 Because this variable is non-normally distributed, we also
examined the square root of this variable. The results are qualitatively the same with the transformed and non-transformed
variables. For ease of interpretation, we report the results with
the non-transformed variables.

<-----Page 9----->218

include indicator variables for all but the first year of
the sample period.
3.5. Estimation and model specification
We analyzed the 5-year panel compiled for this
study utilizing negative binomial models in generalized estimating equations (GEE), which are an
extension of generalized linear models applied to longitudinal data (Liang and Zeger, 1986). Our choice
of analytic technique depended on five factors: (1)
our dependent variable took the form of count data;
(2) the standard errors are likely to be auto correlated
over time; (3) the covariance structure itself was not
of central interest to us; (4) a significant portion of
our sample involved schools that generate no start-ups
during our observation period; and (5) unobserved
school-level heterogeneity likely influences start-up
activity.
We employed a negative binomial estimator because our data takes the form of count data with
large numbers of zeros. Consequently, ordinary least
squares regression is inappropriate. When we examined the distribution of the dependent variable as a
Poisson, a goodness-of-fit test rejected the Poisson
distribution assumption because of over-dispersion,
suggesting that negative binomial models are more
appropriate than Poisson models to analyze the data.
Therefore, we ran negative binomial models to predict
the number of start-ups for each school in each year.
The use of a generalized linear model for time series
data corrects for the problem of auto correlation that
results from unobserved factors influencing patterns in
particular schools over time (Greene, 1990). In particular, the generalized linear model we used corrects for
autocorrelation of residuals (Liang and Zeger, 1986).
GEE is also the most appropriate technique for the
analysis of non-Gaussian longitudinal data for which
the dependence of the outcome on the covariates requires estimation but the covariance structure across
time is not of central interest (Liang and Zeger, 1986).
Because we had multiple observations for each university and we wanted to account for the covariance
relationships over time, we specified the correlation between the error terms to be exchangeable—
correlated similarly across time for each school to
account for expected correlations between the errors
for each school over time. Alternatively, we could

have also justified assuming either an auto-regressive
(AR) or an unstructured correlation structure. Therefore, we also estimated AR1 and unstructured models
in order to assess the robustness of our results. In
both cases, assuming an alternative correlation structure had no meaningful impact on the significance or
magnitude of the results.
Of the 101 schools in the sample, 17 had no start-up
activity in any year. Typical fixed effects models for
estimating panel data cannot estimate effects for samples that include respondents for which there is no
variation in the dependent variable over time. However, we expect that universities for which we observe
no TLO start-up activity over the observation period
are systematically different from those in which there
was some start-up activity. Therefore, dropping those
observations would likely bias the estimates in the
regression analysis. Estimating our regressions using
GEE allowed for the inclusion of universities for which
no start-up activity was observed during the sample
period.
Initially, we also employed random-effects estimators clustered on schools to deal with the potential for
unobserved heterogeneity in explaining the start-up
rates across schools. However, a Hausman test indicated the assumptions upon which the random-effects
model is dependent were untenable. For purposes of
comparison, we also report a model without robust
clustering on university as well as a random-effects
negative binomial model. As is shown below, the
results of these models are not markedly different
from the core GEE model, lending confidence in the
robustness of our results to the choice of analytic
technique.21

that the results we present are artifacts of unobserved heterogeneity
in such things as the relative emphases of different schools on
different scientific fields and the presence or absence of engineering
and medical programs.

predictor and control variables. Models 10–13 provide
robustness checks by examining alternative estimation
techniques. Overall, the results provide substantial
evidence that universities’ intellectual eminence and
licensing policies have a significant impact on TLO
start-up activity, while providing little evidence that
venture capital availability and the commercial orientation of research influence TLO start-up activity.
The university’s intellectual eminence significantly
predicts TLO start-up activity. The estimated coefficient for this variable,22 shown in model 1, implies, ceteris paribus, that an improvement in graduate school
quality by one point is associated with a start-up rate
of 1.68 times the base rate. Put differently, an increase
in intellectual eminence by one standard deviation is
associated with approximately one additional start-up
firm per year. Thus, more eminent universities appear
not only to generate a greater amount of patentable
intellectual property, but also—since licenses, patents,
and invention disclosures are controlled for in the
models we have estimated—create more start-ups to
exploit that intellectual property.
Although the precise mechanism through which
this effect operates is not entirely clear, we have offered two explanations. First, researchers from more
prestigious universities are better researchers and thus
are more likely to create firms to capture the rents to
their rare and valuable intellectual property (Zucker
et al., 1998). Second, since investors use signals, such
as institutional reputation or prestige, to help assess
the commercial potential of university technologies,
inventors from more prestigious universities may be
better able to obtain the necessary capital to start their
own firms.
Our findings also indicate that two sets of university licensing policies—policies regarding the distribution of royalties to inventors and whether or not
the university is permitted to take an equity stake in
licensees—appear to influence start-up activity. As
in the case of intellectual eminence, these results are
robust to different estimation techniques, and are also
robust to different operationalizations of the predictor
variables. Ceteris paribus, the minimum percentage
of royalties distributed to inventors is inversely related to start-up activity such that an increase in the
22 In all of the models, we report the exponentiated coefficients
for ease of interpretation.

inventor’s share of royalties by 10% implies 0.40
fewer start-up firms per year, a decrease of 20% from
the mean. When royalties are measured by the amount
distributed to inventors on a patent yielding US$ 1
million in total royalties, rather than the minimum
distribution rate, the effect size is even greater. By
increasing the opportunity cost of starting up a new
venture, a high inventor share of royalties provides a
disincentive to potential inventor-entrepreneurs.
The other licensing policy that appears to influence
start-up activity is equity policy. Ceteris paribus, universities that have previously demonstrated a willingness to take an equity stake in licensees in exchange for
paying up-front patenting and licensing expenses have
a start-up rate that is 1.89 times that of universities that
have not demonstrated a willingness to take equity.
When equity practices are assessed by the universities’
explicit policies rather than their actual practice, the
effect size is slightly diminished. Universities that
are permitted to take an equity stake in licensees
report a start-up rate 1.69 times that of universities
that are not permitted to make equity arrangements.
Universities that retain the ability to accept an equity
stake in licensees instead of direct reimbursement for
patenting and licensing costs appear to foster greater
start-up activity by providing greater liquidity to
entrepreneurs.
The two additional policy variables that we tested—
the presence of a university-affiliated incubator and
whether or not the university is permitted to actively
make venture capital investments in licensees—do not
appear to have an impact on start-up activity. The coefficient on the incubator indicator variable is positive
as expected, but is not significant. The coefficient on
the venture capital investment indicator variable is actually negative, but is also not significant. Therefore,
we find no evidence that these practices influence
TLO start-up activity.
Our findings provide little support for the contention
that universities that conduct more commerciallyoriented research will experience greater TLO start-up
activity. When commercial orientation is measured
by the percentage of total sponsored research funding
that is derived from industry sources, the estimated
coefficient is positive but is not significant. However,
in an alternative specification in which commercial
orientation is measured by the dollar amount of industry funding (model 5), the coefficient for industry

<-----Page 14----->D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

223

<-----Page 15----->224

D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

funding is positive and significant. A US$ 10 million
increase in industry sponsored research funding is
associated with an increase in start-up activity of 0.13
firms (6.7%) per year, ceteris paribus.
Finally, our results provide no evidence that TLO
start-up activity is influenced by the local availability
of venture capital funding. We operationalized local venture capital availability in four different ways
(i.e. models 1 and 6–8), and the coefficients are not
significant in any of the models we estimated.
As a robustness check, we examined the predictive
validity of our main model on sub-samples of more
eminent and less eminent schools by dividing our sample in half at the median on the eminence score. We
show these results in Table 3. For the more eminent
schools, we find that our results are even stronger than
for the entire sample. Intellectual eminence and equity
policies have a positive effect and the inventor’s share
of royalties has a negative effect on the start-up rate.
Moreover, the magnitude of the coefficients is greater
than that for the overall sample. For this sub-sample,
we still find no effect for local venture capital. However, for more eminent universities, the industry share
of sponsored research has a positive effect on start-up
rates.
In contrast, our model holds less well for less eminent universities. For this sub-sample, we find that
only the policy of taking equity appears to influence
start-up rates. Overall, the examination of the subsamples supports our overall findings, but suggests
that start-up rates at less eminent universities are
driven by more idiosyncratic factors than start-up
rates at more eminent institutions.

5. Discussion
In this study, we compared four different explanations for cross-institutional variation in new firm
formation rates from TLO offices over the 1994–1998
period—the concentration of venture capital in the
area; the reliance of university research and development on industry funding; intellectual eminence; and
university policies. The results show that the intellectual eminence of the university, and the policies
of making equity investments in TLO start-ups and
maintaining a low inventor share of royalties increase
new firm formation activity.

We believe that one of the major strengths of this
study is that the sampled universities jointly account
for the vast majority of university patenting activity
in the US. By extension, they most likely account
for the vast majority of TLO start-ups. Another major strength of the study concerns the mitigation of
selection bias. By examining technology licensing office start-ups, we examine a documented source of
new companies, thereby minimizing the problems of
selection bias in accounting for start-up activity to
exploit other types of new technology developed in
universities.
However, our research design limits our sample to
the most active research universities, and is therefore
not a random sample of all higher education institutions. Moreover, our approach limits our analysis
to new firm formation to exploit university-assigned
technology. Therefore, our ability to generalize to colleges and universities that are not research-oriented,
or to generalize to start-up activity that is not designed
to exploit university-assigned intellectual property,
is limited. For instance, we have found that a commercial orientation, the availability of venture capital
funds, and TLO policies and practices such as the
presence of an incubator do not predict TLO start-up
activity among the sampled universities. We cannot
rule out the possibility that these practices may facilitate start-up activity among colleges and universities
that are not research-oriented or influence other types
of university start-up activity.
Nevertheless, our findings have four important
implications for research on and policy towards university technology transfer and start-up activity. First,
we find no evidence to support the argument that capital market constraints limit TLO start-up activity in
particular locations. Although other forms of private
equity (e.g. angel capital) might influence start-up
activity in ways that we cannot observe, we find that
the amount of formal venture capital available in a
particular location has no significant effect on start-up
activity out of TLOs once university technology production is measured. This result is consistent with
the work of Zucker et al. (1998) who found that venture capital availability did not significantly influence
start-up activity in biotechnology once the distribution of intellectual capital across time and space was
considered. Our findings, like Zucker et al. (1998),
suggest that capital markets distribute venture capital

<-----Page 16----->D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

efficiently over geographic space; and the availability
of local venture capital is not a constraint on TLO
start-up activity.
This result also suggests that venture capitalists
may be late stage investors in university technology.
Other sources of funds, such as angels, government
agencies, and universities themselves (through equity
investment in their own start-ups), may be more important in the early stages, and thus may be catalysts
for new firm formation and economic development.
Our findings direct further research efforts towards
investigating the relative importance of both different funding entities and funding constraints on firm
formation as a mode of exploitation of university
technology.
Second, although the effect of industry funding on
start-up activity may be lagged in ways we cannot
estimate, or influence start-up activity in a way that
we cannot observe, we fail to find adequate support
for the argument that industry funding of university
research makes TLO start-up activity more likely.
In fact, our results are consistent with anecdotal information on TLO start-ups that suggest that many
of these companies seek to exploit basic scientific
discoveries (Association of University Technology
Managers, 1996).
One reason why the commercial orientation of
a university does not predict its start-up rate could
be countervailing effects of commercial orientation.
Although a commercial research orientation might
generate a pool of university inventions that are more
appropriate for new firm formation than is generated
from a governmental research orientation, the funding
structure necessary to generate university inventions
might mitigate the benefits of this better pool of inventions. Because private firms might be very likely
to license commercially valuable inventions that are
generated from research that they fund, any increase
in the pool of commercially valuable inventions that
a commercial orientation creates may be siphoned off
by greater invention licensing by the private sector
providers of research funds. As a result, there is no
net effect on the TLO start-up rate of the university’s
commercial orientation.
Nevertheless, the observation that TLO start-ups
are as likely to occur when government funds university research as when the private sector does so raises
several interesting and important policy questions

225

that future researchers may wish to explore. For example, how should universities manage TLO start-up
activities given that taxpayer funds have been used
to fund that research? And what role will universities
play in technological development if basic research
is transferred to the private sector through proprietary
start-up ventures?
Third, we find evidence that several university
technology transfer policies enhance TLO start-up activity. In particular, a low inventors’ share of royalties
and a willingness to make equity investments in TLO
start-up companies increase start-up activity. These
findings suggest that universities can make policy decisions to generate greater numbers of TLO start-ups.
These policy tools are important because start-ups
and established firm licensees differ in several important ways, including their tendency to contribute
to local economic development, their tendency to
generate significant income for universities, and their
decisions toward knowledge disclosure and research
norms. Understanding the implications of these policy tools is also important because they may generate
conflicting incentives. In particular, many universities
distribute a high percentage of royalties to inventors
in order to encourage the reporting and exploitation
of inventions; however, our results suggest that high
distribution rates also serve as a disincentive to the
creation of start-up firms.
The results also show, however, that many policies
advocated as mechanisms to increase TLO start-up
activity appear to have little effect. In particular, the
effects of university-affiliated incubators and university venture capital funds are insignificant. One
reason why the presence of incubators has an insignificant effect on start-up rates may be that potential
entrepreneurs do not consider the use of incubators
when making the start-up decision. Consequently,
the existence of incubators merely shifts the location
of start-ups (to incubators from outside) rather than
increasing the amount of them. Although we can
conclude that having access to an incubator does not
influence the rate of TLO start-up activity; our analysis cannot determine if university-affiliated incubators
influence the success of TLO start-ups.
One reason why university venture capital funds
have an insignificant effect on start-up rates may
be that university entrepreneurs develop adequate
ties to external venture capitalists to provide the

<-----Page 17----->226

D. Di Gregorio, S. Shane / Research Policy 32 (2003) 209–227

investors with information about them through technical due diligence or other activity. As a result,
TLO entrepreneurs can obtain adequate amounts of
external venture capital. Therefore, university venture capital merely substitutes for, rather than adds
to, external venture capital in its effect on start-up
activity. Although we cannot be sure why these policies have no effect on start-up rates, we believe that
university officials, researchers, and policy makers
will find the evidence in support of some policies and
not in support of others useful in developing explanations for and procedures toward the management
of university technology transfer and TLO start-up
activity.
Fourth, our results show more eminent universities
have greater TLO start-up activity than other universities. This result is consistent with the argument that
leading researchers found companies to earn rents on
their intellectual capital (Zucker et al., 1998). It is also
consistent with the argument that gathering the necessary resources to found a company to exploit uncertain
new technology is easier when the university’s status
enhances the entrepreneur’s credibility.
The tendency for TLO start-ups to come disproportionately from eminent universities also generates
important implications for researchers seeking to explain the creation of new technology companies, as
well as policy makers interested in influencing the
mode of technology transfer out of universities. In particular, the results suggest that researchers and policy
makers consider the impact on university technology
transfer and industry evolution of the tendency for
new technology companies to emerge from eminent
universities.
In short, significant differences exist across universities in their generation of new firms to exploit
university inventions. Both university policies and
intellectual eminence influence this variation, generating important implications for research on and policy
towards university technology transfer. Although this
paper provides a survey of the effects of university
equity investment and royalty policies, intellectual
eminence, and funding sources on university TLO
start-up activity across a broad spectrum of universities, future research should examine each of these
factors in a more fine-grained manner. Hopefully,
other scholars will view this study as a springboard
for more refined research on these specific topics.
