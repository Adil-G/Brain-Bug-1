Abstract

Downloaded by Temple University At 11:15 10 October 2014 (PT)

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of the dimensions of organisational
trust on organisational innovativeness in a relatively large survey sample of the information and
communication technology (ICT) and paper and pulp industries in Finland.
Design/methodology/approach – Organisational trust is deemed to consist of both interpersonal
and impersonal types of trust. The empirical part of the study shows the relationship between various
types of trust and dimensions of organisational innovativeness. Quantitative empirical analysis is
based on a survey of 40 organisational units and 214 respondents within the ICT and paper and pulp
industries.
Findings – The impact of different types of organisational trust on dimensions of organisational
innovativeness was analyzed. The results imply that the impersonal form in particular, namely
institutional trust, has an important role in determining organisational innovativeness.
Research implications – This study contributes both to the literature on organisational
innovativeness, as well as to the emerging theory on trust, in its approach to trust as not only an
interpersonal issue, but also as something with impersonal aspects.
Practical implications – It is suggested that managers should pay special attention to impersonal
forms of trust, i.e. to the institutional dimension of organisational trust. Above all, institutional trust
and its development could be seen as a strategic question for companies.
Originality/value – This study makes a significant theoretical contribution by examining the
linkages between various dimensions of organisational trust and organisational innovativeness, which
have previously been studied only to a very minor extent. It thus provides a richer understanding of
the relationship between organisational trust and innovativeness.

Introduction
Innovation and innovativeness have become critical issues in sustaining competitive
advantage, especially in large and mature organisations (see, e.g. Dougherty and
Hardy, 1996). Firms cannot survive without being able continuously to renew and
innovate. Half of today’s revenues in the private sector, especially in high-technology
segments such as the ICT industry, flow from products and services that are less than
five years old. Furthermore, innovativeness has also become increasingly important in
traditional sectors such as the paper and pulp industry, as companies are trying to
retain their competitiveness in the global competitive climate. The importance of
innovativeness to competitiveness is therefore evident (Ruppel and Harrington, 2000;
see also Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Wang and Ahmed, 2004).
The critical role of organisational trust in promoting organisational efficiency and
effectiveness is expected to be accentuated in post-bureaucratic network organisations,

<-----Page 3----->Downloaded by Temple University At 11:15 10 October 2014 (PT)

in which idiosyncratic knowledge, and interpersonal and intra-organisational
collaboration are assuming increasing significance (see, e.g. Tyler, 2003). Trust
increases the efficiency and effectiveness of communication (Blomqvist, 2002), as well
as organisational cooperation and collaboration (Mayer et al., 1995; Tyler, 2003). It has
also been identified as a critical factor in leadership effectiveness (Tyler, 2003),
employee satisfaction (Shockley-Zalabak et al., 2000), commitment (Dirks and Ferrin,
2001) and performance (Barney and Hansen, 1994). Furthermore, intra-organisational
trust has become important in many firms in which labour conflicts and downsizing
might have resulted in decreased levels of trust both between employees and in
leader-employee relationships (Rankin, 1998).
Increased understanding of the role of trust, and of the impact of various types of
organisational trust, is expected to have both theoretical and managerial implications
for knowledge-intensive organisations. Above all, a comprehensive understanding of
the effect of different kinds of trust on innovativeness would be valuable. A study
promoting such understanding would shed light on how innovativeness could be
enhanced by building up trust. Managers could consider more carefully how the
different dimensions of interpersonal trust, i.e. based on competence, benevolence and
reliability, affect different dimensions of organisational innovativeness. For example, if
a company aspires to develop behavioural innovations, in which case the benevolence
component of vertical interpersonal trust would be critical, special emphasis should be
placed on managerial actions that affect perceived benevolence. On the other hand, the
impersonal type of organisational trust could be enhanced through the
institutionalisation of certain HRD processes and organisational structures. Thus a
combination of HRD and strategy could be used to develop this institutional and
impersonal dimension when its role in organisational innovativeness is known.
The objective of this study is to examine the effect of various types of organisational
trust on the different dimensions of organisational innovativeness. Despite the
importance of both phenomena, as demonstrated above, the role of trust in this context
has so far attracted very little interest in academic research. To the best of our
knowledge, the role and impact of different types of organisational trust on different
dimensions of organisational innovativeness has not been studied before, and this was
the question we addressed in our research. In our investigations we used quantitative
research methodology and a survey sample of 214 employees from 40 organisational
units within the information and communication technology (ICT) and paper and pulp
industries.
Theoretical framework
Organisational trust
The concept of organisational trust is discussed in the literature on economics (Sako,
1992), sociology (Luhmann, 1979) and social psychology (Blau, 1964), for example.
According to the meta- and content analysis conducted by Cruz and Costa-Silva (2004),
trust could be approached from numerous theoretical frameworks, such as transaction
cost theory (Williamson, 1975), social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), agency theory
(Eisenhardt, 1989), the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991), system theory
(Luhmann, 1979) and attribution theory (Kelley, 1967).
This study concerns both the interpersonal and impersonal types of organisational
trust. Interpersonal trust could be further broken down into two dimensions: lateral

trust, which refers to trust within employees, and vertical trust, which, on the other
hand, refers to trust between employees and leaders (Costigan et al., 1998). It may be
competence-, benevolence- or reliability- based (see, e.g. Mayer et al., 1995, 1999).
Organisational trust is thus defined as the positive expectations individuals have about
the competence, reliability and benevolence of organisational members, as well as the
institutional trust within the organisation (Mayer et al., 1995; McKnight et al., 1998).
Research on trust has identified an abundance of other dimensions of interpersonal
trust, such as ability, capability, integrity, truthfulness and goodwill. However, we
base our analysis on the study conducted by Mayer et al. (1995, 1999) since this is one
the most frequently applied set of trust dimensions.
We have called the impersonal type of organisational trust institutional trust.
Impersonal trust has been studied very little in the organisational context, with the
exceptions of McCauley and Kuhnert (1992), Atkinson and Butcher (2003), Costigan
et al. (1998) and McKnight et al. (1998, 2002), for example. Procedural justice, in the
form of fair HR processes for example, has been positively associated with employee
attitudes, such as commitment to the organisation (Pearce et al., 2000). This
institutional trust could be characterised as the trust of its members in the
organisation’s vision and strategy, its technological and commercial competence, its
fair processes and structures, as well as its HR policies.
Atkinson and Butcher (2003, pp. 290-1), too, contend that trust exists in both
impersonal and personal forms. Impersonal trust is based on the roles, systems and
reputations from which inferences are drawn about the trustworthiness of an
individual. The (inter)personal form, on the other hand, is based on the interaction with
a particular relationship. Institutional trust is, in most cases, determined by the
efficiency and the fairness of the organisation-wide systems, such as the HR policies, as
mentioned above (Costigan et al., 1998, p. 309). According to McKnight et al. (1998,
pp. 478-479), institutional trust means that one believes the necessary impersonal
structures are in place to enable one to act in anticipation of a successful future
endeavour. It appears to take two forms: situational normality; and structural
assurance. Belief in situational normality stems from the appearance that things are
normal and customary, or that everything seems to be in its proper order. It is therefore
defined as the belief that success is likely because the situation is normal. Structural
assurance, on the other hand, is defined as the belief that success is likely because
contextual conditions such as promises, contracts, regulations and guarantees
(structural safeguards) are in place. Thus, the institutional type of organisational trust
characterises organisational practices and processes that are not personalised to its
members, with the exception of top management, such as technological and
commercial competence, strategy and vision, HR practices and communication.
Figure 1 illustrates the concept of organisational trust applied in this paper.
Organisational innovativeness
An innovation may take many forms, such as product and process innovation, radical
and incremental innovation, and administrative and technological innovation. An
organisation’s ability to create such innovations, i.e. to innovate, has long been
recognised as one of the key determinants for it to survive and succeed (see, e.g. Wang
and Ahmed, 2004). As innovations exist in various forms, various dimensions of
organisational innovativeness have been distinguished, their number and nature

varying to a great extent depending on the author. According to Garcia and Calantone
(2002), innovativeness is most frequently used as a measure of the degree of newness of
an innovation, i.e. whether it is highly or marginally innovative. Johannessen et al.
(2001, pp. 20-2) suggest that in order to isolate a useful definition and measure of
innovation, three newness-related questions should be addressed:
(1) what is new;
(2) how new; and
(3) new to whom.
They therefore conducted a study in which they analysed six different types of
innovative activity:
(1) developing new products;
(2) new services;
(3) new methods of production;
(4) opening new markets;
(5) finding new sources of supply; and
(6) new ways of organising.
However, they came to the conclusion that innovation on the organisational level could
be defined and measured as a single construct, distinguished only by the degree of
radicalness. Subramanian and Nilakanta (1996), on the other hand, distinguish two
different types of organisational innovativeness: technical; and the administrative. As
opposed to Johannessen et al. (2001), they consider it evident that innovativeness is a
multidimensional construct.

<-----Page 6----->EJIM

We could thus say that the dimensions of innovativeness are still lacking in clarity.
We have used a multi-dimensional conceptualisation, and based our analysis on the
study conducted by Wang and Ahmed (2004). They identify five main areas that
determine an organisation’s overall innovativeness, which they define as “an
organisation’s overall innovative capability of introducing new products to the market,
or opening up new markets, through combining strategic orientation with innovative
behaviour and process” (Wang and Ahmed, 2004, p. 304). Their five dimensions,
product, market, process, behavioural and strategic innovativeness, are briefly
summarised in Table I.

The role of trust in organisational innovativeness
Empirical research on the role of trust in organisational innovativeness is rather scarce,
and its role in knowledge creation and innovativeness has been approached from
many, yet mainly distinct points-of-view. Some of the key empirical studies are
analysed in the following. First, according to Clegg et al. (2002), trust is implicated in
the innovation process such that expectancy that the organisation takes one’s ideas
seriously is positively related to idea implementation. On the other hand, the
expectancy that those managing the organisation have one’s interests at heart, and that
one will share in the benefits of any changes, is positively related to idea suggestion
(Clegg et al., 2002). Second, trust in a supervisor is also positively correlated with a

subordinate’s innovative behaviour (Tan and Tan, 2000). In addition, Chowdhury
(2005) found that both affect- and cognition-based trust have a positive influence on
complex knowledge sharing, and in a similar vein, Levin and Cross (2004) found that
benevolence- and competence- based trust mediated the link between strong ties and
perceived receipt of useful knowledge. According to Szulanski et al. (2004), the
perceived trustworthiness of the source contributes to the effectiveness of intrafirm
knowledge transfer. Finally, Mooradian et al. (2005) found trust to be positively related
to knowledge sharing both within and across teams.
It could be concluded from these various research results that there is substantial
support for the assumption that high levels of trust have a positive effect on the
effectiveness and quality of organisational knowledge sharing and innovation. However,
the contexts of the studies concerned varied to a great extent: some of them concerned new
product development, some innovative behaviour, and others complex knowledge
sharing. Similarly, the level of analysis also varied, from that of individual innovative
behaviour and new-product-development teams to social networks and partnerships.
These differences affect the possibilities of generalisation since each study contributes
only in terms of its own context and unit of analysis. It is partly as a result of these diverse
contexts and levels of analysis that the results of the studies are still very fragmented.
Hypothesis development and modelling
Despite the lack of research on the role of trust in organisational innovativeness, many
studies support the assumption that high levels of trust have a positive effect on the
effectiveness and quality of organisational knowledge sharing and innovativeness.
Previous research has mainly approached organisational trust from the perspective of
trust between individuals, both among employees (lateral trust) and in leader-employee
relationships (vertical trust). Therefore, in this study we first hypothesise that:
H1. Lateral trust is positively related to organisational innovativeness.
This first hypothesis assumes that the dimensions of lateral trust (trust between
employees) are positively related to the dimensions of organisational innovativeness.
Clegg et al. (2002) propose that people are more likely to make efforts to innovate (by
generating ideas and helping to implement them) when they have experiences of
reasonable and positive responses from others. This is related to trust among
employees. According to Ahmed (1998), trust is an important cultural norm that
enhances innovativeness. Both of these studies give support to the above hypothesis.
However, there are no studies that focus on the impact of different dimensions of lateral
trust on different dimensions of innovativeness.
H2. Vertical trust is positively related to organisational innovativeness.
The second hypothesis assumes that the dimensions of vertical trust (trust between
employees and leaders) are positively related to the dimensions of organisational
innovativeness. Accordingly, Tan and Tan (2000, p. 254) found that trust in a
supervisor is positively correlated with a subordinate’s innovative behaviour, and
Chandler et al. (2000, p. 62) argue that:
[. . .] the uncertainty and complexity inherent in innovation suggests that employee trust in
management is central to the development of an innovation-supportive culture because trust
enables people to take risks without fear of or undue penalty for failure.

H3. Institutional trust is positively related to organisational innovativeness.
The third hypothesis assumes that institutional trust is positively related to the
dimensions of organisational innovativeness. As mentioned, we add to the
understanding of organisational trust by bringing in the impersonal dimension,
which we call institutional trust. In our view, this aspect of trust may well assume
increasing significance given the fact that bureaucratic organisational structures no
longer support knowledge work demanding intrapreneurship, local decision-making
and speed of action (Miles et al., 2000). As bureaucracies fail, network types of
organisation become increasingly important. In a global and highly competitive
environment interpersonal and social trust, whether lateral or vertical, may also fail,
which could result in organisational inefficiency. Organisations in the future will not be
able to rely solely on interpersonal trust, and will require complementary mechanisms
that support knowledge creation and transfer. The focus will no longer be on the
particular and the social, but more on the universal, and the role of institutional trust is
therefore likely to be complementary to that of interpersonal organisational trust.
Research design
Data collection and basic information on the sample units
The empirical data for our study was collected by means of a standardised survey of 40
organisational units of three large Finnish multinational companies in May and June
2005. The companies represent different industries: companies A and B operate in the
ICT sector and company C in the paper and pulp industry. The units were not
randomly selected, and moreover, the companies were able to freely choose the
participating units. The questionnaire was distributed to a total of 457 people. The
contact person in the company or unit was asked to select ten employees (if there were
more than ten) randomly for the most part, but also to some extent by means of
convenience sampling.
The questionnaire was available both in paper format and in an online version via
the internet. Two different delivery options were given to the respondents in order to
increase the response rate. The researcher was not involved in the delivery, which was
taken care of by a contact person working in the company or the unit, such as the
development manager, the HR manager or the innovation manager. This type of
approach was chosen because it is generally assumed that respondents take research
more seriously if the questionnaires come from someone belonging to the organisation,
and not from an outside researcher.
The final response rate was 51.9 per cent (457 questionnaires sent out of which 237
were returned). In total there were 23 deficient responses that did not include adequate
information, and they were filtered out of the analysis. The effective response rate was
thus 46.8 per cent (214/457), which could be considered rather high in this type of
study.
There were, in total, 207 valid responses that were included in the analysis. The
respondents were employees (46 per cent), project managers (20 per cent), team leaders
(9 per cent), supervisors (10 per cent), heads of units (4 per cent), HR managers (0.5 per
cent), and development managers (1 per cent). The majority of the 40 participating
units were R&D (19, or 47.5 per cent) and manufacturing (eight, or 20 per cent) units.
Overall, seven of them belonged to the ICT company A, nine to the ICT company B,
and 24 to the paper and pulp company C. For this study we took a deeper look at the

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded by Temple University At 11:15 10 October 2014 (PT)

R&D and manufacturing units by including them in the analysis as independent
(dummy) variables.
Measurements
The questionnaire consisted mostly of multi-item measures that had been validated
and shown to be reliable in previous research. The items concerned interpersonal and
institutional organisational trust and organisational innovativeness. The questions
were answered on a five-point Likert-scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree, 5 ¼ strongly agree).
Some of the items were negatively worded and then reversed in order to avoid
social-desirability effects (see, e.g. Hair et al., 1998, pp. 130 and 472). The following
exploratory factor analyses were performed using principal component analysis and
Varimax rotation.
Interpersonal organisational trust. Both lateral and vertical types of interpersonal
trust were measured within the dimensions of competence, benevolence and
reliability. The items were adapted, with a few modifications, from Mayer and Davis
(1999) and McKnight et al. (2002). We conducted a principal component analysis, and
the Varimax-rotated factor loadings for each variable are presented in Tables II
and III.

The three-factor solution for lateral trust explained 65.3 per cent of the total variance,
and received an acceptable value on the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling
adequacy (KMO 0.901). All the variables received acceptable values of communality,
ranging from 0.460 to 0.773. The proposed three factors were named:
(1) trust in employee reliability (six items, alpha 0.894);
(2) trust in employee competence (five items, alpha 0.846); and
(3) trust in employee benevolence (four items, alpha 0.859)[1].
The factor analysis also yielded three components for vertical trust, explaining 74.8 per
cent of the total variance, and received an acceptable value on the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
measure of sampling adequacy (KMO 0.941). All of the variables received acceptable
values of communality, ranging from 0.524 to 0.846. The proposed three factors were
named:
(1) trust in the leaders’ reliability (six items, alpha 0.920);
(2) trust in the leaders’ competence (five items, alpha 0.935); and
(3) trust in the leaders’ benevolence (four items, alpha 0.896)[2].

No specific institutional trust, namely structural assurance and situational normality, items

The items that do measure it in this study are based on earlier very limited research
(McKnight et al., 2002; Lee, 2004; Daley and Vasu, 1998), as well as on our intuitive
thinking and observation. Institutional trust was also assessed by means of principal
component analysis, and the results are shown in Table IV.

However, institutional trust was considered a one-dimensional construct, and the final

Organisational innovativeness. Organisational innovativeness was measured on 20
items adapted from Wang and Ahmed (2004). Wang and Ahmed classified the items
into five factors in accordance with the following dimensions: product; market; process;
behavioural; and strategic innovativeness. Their original factor solution failed in this
study, but we developed a new Varimax-rotated solution, which is presented in Table V
(Wang and Ahmed’s original factors are given in parentheses).

The proposed four-factor solution explained 62.7 per cent of the total variance and
received an acceptable value on the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling
adequacy (KMO 0.867). All of the variables received acceptable values of communality,
ranging from 0.461 to 0.731. The proposed four factors were named:
(1) product innovativeness (five items, alpha 0.833);
(2) behavioural innovativeness (five items, alpha 0.825);
(3) strategic innovativeness (three items, alpha 0.712); and
(4) process innovativeness (three items, alpha 0.557)[3].
As can be seen, the final factor solution is not identical to the original solution of Wang
and Ahmed (2004), although the two are comparable. Because Wang and Ahmed (2004)
implied that dimensions of innovativeness could be correlated, we also ran the factor
analysis using oblique (Oblimin) rotation[4]. This also resulted in only four factors (the
dimensions of product and market innovativeness were combined into one factor),
explaining 62 per cent of the variance. The loading pattern was not very different from
the one with Varimax rotation: only the item “the most recent marketing programme is
revolutionary . . . ” now loaded better, together with other product- and
market-innovativeness items.
Results
Correlation analysis
Table VI presents the means, standard deviations and Cronbach’s alphas of the
variables, and provides a correlation matrix in which * * indicates statistically
significant correlation at the 0.01 level and * indicates statistically significant
correlation at the 0.05 level.
As the matrix shows, almost every dimension of innovativeness correlates
statistically significantly with the seven dimensions of organisational trust. This
indicates that organisational trust and innovativeness have interconnections. The
dimensions of organisational trust also correlate significantly with each other. The
strong positive correlation between institutional trust and dimensions of vertical trust
are particularly noteworthy, since this could be a problem in regression analyses
inducing problems of multicollinearity.
Regression analysis and hypothesis testing
We analysed the effects of the dimensions of organisational trust on the four types of
organisational innovativeness by means of multivariate linear regression analysis.
Figure 2 illustrates the model for the regression analysis. In addition to organisational
trust and innovativeness, we included two dummy variables representing the
classification of the nature of the organisational units, one indicating whether or not it
is an R&D unit, and the other whether or not it is a manufacturing unit.
As the regression models in Table VII show, the role of institutional trust in
organisational innovativeness seems to be the most important. In addition,
interpersonal trust is related to organisational innovativeness, although not all
dimensions are positively associated. There is a clear negative relationship between
trust in employee reliability and product innovativeness. We cannot explain this
logically, but conclude that it is due to strong multicollinearity in the variables.
Multicollinearity refers to a troublesome situation in which the correlations among the

Figure 2.
The research hypotheses
and measurement model

independent variables are strong, and Cohen et al. (2003, pp. 422-5) suggest the
following measures:
.
pairwise correlations among independent variables – the highest correlation in
the matrix presented in Table VI is 0.759, which is lower than the suggested
guideline for serious multicollinearity;
.
tolerance and VIF – the common cut-off thresholds are generally , 0.1 for
tolerance and . 10 for VIF (Hair et al., 1998), and since the tolerance values
range from 0.244 to 0.642, and the VIF values from 1.562 to 4.103, respectively,
the model should have no serious problems of multicollinearity; and
.
condition number, which should generally be , 30 – the condition index is
33.518, implying multicollinearity.
Cohen et al. (2003, pp. 422-5) suggest four potential remedies for multicollinearity:
model re-specification, increasing the sample size, ridge regression, and principal
components analysis. Evidence of the benefits of ridge regression is still
controversial: Zhang and Ibrahim (2005), for example, concluded in their
simulations that it did, in some cases of severe multicollinearity, perform even
worse than ordinary least squares estimation. As an alternative we attempted to
correct for multicollinearity by re-specifying the model so that the original seven
dimensions of organisational trust were replaced by three components. The results
are shown in Table VIII.
We found lateral trust to be significantly related to none of the dimensions of
innovativeness. Vertical trust is positively related to behavioural innovativeness but
negatively to product and process innovativeness, while institutional trust is positively
related to every dimension. The tolerance values are all above 0.288, and the VIF

values below 3.419. The condition index is 24.404, and thus multicollinearity should
not affect the interpretation of the regression coefficients.
Consequently, the first research hypothesis is rejected since the significant
relations between lateral trust and organisational innovativeness are both positive
and negative. A positive relationship exists between trust in employee competence
and product innovativeness, whereas the relationship between trust in employee
reliability and product innovativeness is negative. No other significant relations
between lateral trust and organisational innovativeness were identified, and the
robustness analysis indicates no significant effects when the dimensions of lateral
trust are combined.
The second hypothesis, on the other hand, is supported. The only significant
relation is between trust in the leaders’ reliability and behavioural innovativeness. This
could be understood to mean that the leader’s reliability supports employee efforts at
behavioural innovativeness, which measures receptivity to new ideas and innovation.
New ideas and innovation demand risk-taking rather than risk-avoidance from
employees and leaders (see, e.g. Tan and Tan, 2000). However, the robustness models
show significant negative relations between vertical trust and product and process
innovativeness, and positive relations between vertical trust and behavioural
innovativeness.
The third research hypothesis is also supported. Institutional trust is positively and
significantly related to each dimension of organisational innovativeness, and the
coefficient values are also relatively high, especially as far as product (0.598) and
process (0.584) innovativeness are concerned.
In sum, organisational trust with its various dimensions explained 24.6 per cent of the
variance in product innovativeness, 35.6 per cent of the variance in behavioural
innovativeness, 14.7 per cent of the variance in strategic innovativeness, and 15.2 per cent
of the variance in process innovativeness. However, there are problems of
multicollinearity, especially in the strong inter-correlations between vertical and
institutional trust.
Discussion and conclusion
In this paper we have analysed the effects of both interpersonal and institutional
organisational trust on various dimensions of organisational innovativeness. We found
the effect of institutional trust to be stronger than that of other types of trust in
determining the organisation’s innovativeness. We also found that organisational trust
explained a larger proportion of the variance in the behavioural dimension of
innovativeness, but only about 15 per cent in the strategic and process dimensions.
Theoretical conclusions
This study makes a significant theoretical contribution by examining the linkages
between various dimensions of organisational trust and organisational innovativeness,
which have previously been studied only to a very minor extent. It thus provides a richer
understanding of the relationship between organisational trust and innovativeness.
We found that behavioural innovativeness, defined as: “the overall internal
receptivity to new ideas and innovation that is demonstrated through individuals,
teams and management and that enables the formation of an innovative culture”
(Wang and Ahmed, 2004, p. 205) could be most effectively enhanced by building both
interpersonal and impersonal organisational trust, i.e. the institutional dimension.

<-----Page 19----->Downloaded by Temple University At 11:15 10 October 2014 (PT)

Vertical trust (trust in the leader’s reliability) was found to be critical in terms of
offering the support needed for the reception of new ideas and innovations. The
importance of leaders as role models and initiators of organisational innovativeness is
also confirmed, and is in line with earlier studies emphasising the critical role of middle
management in organisational innovativeness (see, e.g. Amabile, 1988; Kanter, 1988;
Dougherty and Hardy, 1996). The significance of the behavioural dimension is also
emphasised by Martins and Terblance (2003), for example, who argue that behaviour
that supports innovativeness, i.e. mistake-handling, idea-generating, risk-taking and
the encouragement of change, leads to overall organisational creativity and innovation.
The impact of impersonal and institutional trust on all dimensions of organisational
innovativeness was highlighted.
Our study questions the innovativeness dimensions presented by Wand and
Ahmed (2004). Our results indicate that product and market innovativeness could be
considered a single dimension, while Wang and Ahmed consider them to be separate.
The differences could be attributable to the different industry samples, for example;
this study was limited to the paper and pulp and ICT industries, whereas Wang and
Ahmed (2004) used a more extended set. In addition, we used the organisational unit as
the level of analysis in the questions.
Managerial conclusions
When hierarchies collapse and traditional incentives work poorly with knowledge
workers, different types of trust become increasingly critical. In contrast to social and
interpersonal trust, institutional trust could be understood as trust in organisational
structures, processes and policies supporting the organisational interaction, and thus also
social trust. This study indicates that managers should pay special attention to
impersonal forms of trust, i.e. to the institutional dimension of organisational trust.
Managerial actions supporting organisation-wide norms and policies, such as the
transparent and understandable communication of the strategy and fair (HR) processes,
could enhance experienced institutional trust. We feel that top management could also be
perceived as part of the organisational institution, and of the related institutional trust. It
should therefore also pay attention to the integrity of its words and actions, and actively
support the development and maintenance of institutional trust. Above all, institutional
trust and its development could be considered a strategic question for companies.
Limitations and suggestions for further research
The data applied in this study was collected only in the ICT and paper and pulp
industries, which we see as a limitation in terms of generalisation. In general, survey
studies suffer from common method bias, which is a problem that cannot be easily or
unambiguously controlled. The method of sampling (convenience as opposed to
random) is also worth remembering when the results are assessed. Moreover,
innovativeness or performance measures could also be gathered from external sources
(management assessment and objective measures), which would increase the reliability
of the analysis. However, this might be difficult on the unit level because
performance-measurement criteria vary to a great extent.
The institutional dimension of organisational trust seems to feature very little in the
extant research, yet it apparently has a major impact on organisational innovativeness.
In the future, a full-scale development and validation process for institutional trust
should be devised. There is also clearly a need for the in-depth conceptual and analytical

study of this impersonal type of organisational trust, as it is has attracted very little
research attention in the organisational context, and furthermore, our measures were
partly intuitive. With regard to institutional trust, we need to consider the unit of
analysis because at the unit level the measures for vertical and institutional trust may
partly collude. This raises the question of whether institutional trust is totally
impersonal, or whether the interpersonal aspects with regard to top management should
be included. It is therefore worth considering whether it should retain its impersonal
quality and be restricted to situational normality and structural assurance, and all items
referring to management removed, or whether the role of top management should be
clarified. On the other hand, an in-depth analysis of its role and nature may give a richer
understanding, and offer a more valid measurement. Both analytical and empirical
studies are needed in order to reveal more of the nature of institutional trust, as well as to
confirm its role in supporting organisational innovativeness.
Notes
1. One item taken from trust in employee benevolence was removed from the analysis since it
did not load correctly in accordance with the theory (The employees in this organisational
unit would not knowingly do anything to hurt me).
2. One item from trust in the leaders’ benevolence was removed from the analysis since it did
not load correctly in accordance with the theory (The leaders in this organisational unit
would not knowingly do anything to hurt me).
3. All the negatively worded items were removed from the analysis since they tended to load on
the same factor despite the fact that they were reversed (The new products and services of
this organisational unit contain only minor changes to the previous products and services; In
comparison with its competitors, this organisational unit has a lower success rate in
launching new products and services; This organisational unit’s R&D and
product-development resources are not adequate to meet the need of developing new
products and services; When new ways of doing things are found, this organisational unit is
among the last to adopt them).
