ABSTRACT
Building on past research on new venture failure this study asks: What are the
pathways, or the sequences of decisions, actions, and events, to failure among Internet
new ventures? And, how are they different from the pathways of non-failed Internet
ventures? Four failed ventures were closely matched with non-failed Internet new
ventures and their histories were compared. Results revealed that the pathways of
failed ventures in contrast to those of their non-failed counterparts showed greater
complexity, less orderliness in the pace of events, and a greater intensity in the level of
activity.
INTRODUCTION
Prior to the market shakeout in
year 2000, market value of Internet
companies was estimated to exceed $1
trillion (Barron’s Online, March 20,
2000), and it fell to $572 billion in
December 2000 (Morgan Stanley, Dean
Witter, 2000). Failure of new ventures
in Internet space destroyed a significant
portion of wealth and in a very short
period of time. A majority of the
ventures were newly minted public
ventures, i.e., completed their initial
public offerings (IPOs) within the last
few years.
While cross-sectional analyses
of large data point to several reasons
for the failures, e.g., high levels of noninvestment expenses and shift in
investor sentiment toward using more
conservative valuations, one question
that persists is: What are the most
frequent pathways, i.e., series of linked
decisions, actions, and events, to failure
of new Internet ventures? And, what
are the differences in pathways, if any,
between failed and non-failed Internet
ventures?
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

In this paper, we will examine
these and related questions by studying
the case histories of several Internet
ventures that have completed IPO
during 1995-2000. The pathways to
failure and their implications will be
discussed in the paper.
BACKGROUND
Failure rates are generally high
for new ventures: According to
Timmons and Spinelli (2004), roughly
one in five new ventures fail. Earlier
studies of new venture failures show
that two out of three new ventures die
within seven years.
From a broader perspective,
Stinchombe (1965) indicated that the
risk of failure of new ventures is
extremely high due to the “liability of
newness.” New ventures require the
development of new roles, standard
social and operational routines for
running the business, relationships with
stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, buyers) in
an effort to gain trust, and a dependable
customer base to utilize its products or
services. Since Stinchcombe’s (1965)
writing, multiple factors, some from the
 206

<-----Page 1----->external environment and some from
international environment have been
identified as causes of new venture
failure.
With regard to external factors,
Timmons (1999: pp.32) cites a Wall
Street Journal report on new venture
failures points that hostile economic
and market conditions account for 47
per cent of failures of new ventures.
Also, performance tends to be lower
(Covin and Slevin, 1990; Kunkel,
1991; Miller and Dess, 1996) for
ventures operating in the introductory
stage of an industry.
With internal factors, new
ventures are reported to have failed due
to internal a lack of management skills,
inappropriate strategy, poor vision, and
poor management of capital
(Zacharakis, Meyer, and DeCastro,
1999). According to Meyer and Dean
(1993), when new ventures reach
‘executive limits’ of the entrepreneurial
team, that is, when the top management
team can no longer cope with the
demands placed on the venture and the
team members are not replaced, the
ventures are likely to die.
It is generally acknowledged
that failure is not an event; it is a
process. Failure of firms, most notably
relatively old firms, seems to follow a
downward spiraling process. According
to Hambrick and D’Aveni (1990), who
studied the process by which relatively
established firms end up in bankruptcy,
the seeds of bankruptcy may be laid as
far back as ten years prior to actual
bankruptcy. Following a shock –
environmental or internal shock, firm’s
slack is impacted and depletes the
ability to withstand further shocks. The
downward spiral may be set off by top
management’s misperceptions of
events and erratic choices in adverse
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings

conditions that then further speed the
failure process.
A traditional approach to
understanding new venture failure is to
identify the relative importance of
various factors associated with failure,
and manage the risks appropriately.
The assumption underlying this
approach is that a few factors are
deemed as pivotal to venture survival
and that focusing on the factors would
be fruitful. Also, these factors, acting
independently, cause a new venture to
fail. For example, Wilbon (2002)
reported that enhancing core
technology resources, e.g., R&D
spending and recruiting executives with
technology experience, early in the life
of the venture raise the odds of survival
of the venture after IPO.
An alternative perspective that
we present in this paper is: a
“combination” of factors causes failure.
Process of failure is akin to the process
by which accidents occur. According to
Perrow (1999), failures are “normal”
events. Cook and O’Connor (2005), in
a review paper on “thinking about
accidents and systems” reviewed
several accidents in settings ranging
from nuclear power plants, space
agency, and hospitals. Cook and
O’Connor’s review and the stream of
literature on accidents (Perrow, 1999)
offer several useful leads for
understanding new venture failures.
1. Though new ventures are
formed with growth and value
creation in view, a number of
elements put in place, e.g.,
financing, corporate and
business strategy,
organizational structure,
management systems and
processes, in themselves may
have “holes” or develop holes
over time. The holes are
 207

<-----Page 2----->markers of impending failure of
new venture.
2. The holes serve as latent
conditions and “conspire” with
other conditions, e.g., economic
conditions, to result in a perfect
failure. The latent conditions
come to exist for a variety of
reasons:
Executives in new Internet
ventures often deal with new
and emerging technologies and
markets. In early stages of
industry, it is rather difficult to
see the holes and assess their
potential impact. In early stages
of industry evolution, e.g.,
Internet technology-based
industries back in late 1990s,
executives face the question:
what might work in this
industry? Therefore, executives
tend to engage in
experimentation to identify
strategies that might work. It is
often difficult to distinguish
“holes” from strategies that
might work.
As industry evolves, strategies
that work become clearer but a
different question comes to the
front: what will work for my
venture? And, strategies that
worked for other ventures in the
industry or a different industry
might prove to be “holes” for
certain ventures. Transition
from private venture to public
firm involves experimentation
and selection of a winning
strategy. But the presence of
certain latent conditions, e.g.,
founding team characteristics,
ownership structure, and
alliances, technological
resources, of the venture may
render experimentation and
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

subsequent selection of strategy
ineffectual.
New venture failure is often
preceded by a series of events and
responses on the part of the founding
team to the events. Tracing the events
along the way to failure of each new
venture describes the pathway to
failure. The differences, if any, between
the pathways of the failed and the nonfailed ventures would help
entrepreneurs avoid the pathways to
failure.
Transition from privately held
venture to publicly held firm presents
additional risks: At the juncture of IPO,
there are risks are associated with
strategic initiatives that new public
ventures initiate, e.g., acquisitions,
mergers, and alliances, and strategic
adaptations that new ventures attempt
to undertake. New ventures
contemplating IPO or ventures that
have just completed IPO face rather
unique challenges.
Successful transition of private
ventures in to publicly held firms
involves a series of restructurings
(Bowman and Singh, 1993; Marten,
2003). Those include:
• Financial restructuring – it
involves converting venture
capital, private placement,
preferred stock, debt, and other
forms of financing in to
publicly held stock
• Portfolio restructuring – it
involves acquisitions, mergers,
forming alliances, and sellingoff certain business lines to
sustain the growth and value of
the venture
• Organization restructuring – it
involves redesigning systems
and processes so that venture
strategies are executed
effectively and efficiently
 208

<-----Page 3----->•

Management restructuring – it
involves restructuring the board
of directors, top management
team, changing the form of
organization to reflect the
restructured portfolio of
businesses of the venture
Navigating these restructurings can
be risky and can raise the odds of
failure of the newly minted public
ventures.
In this paper we will examine the
following questions: What are the most
frequent pathways that lead new
ventures to fail? And, what are the
differences, if any, between failed and
non-failed ventures?
The Study Design
For the purposes of the study
reported in this paper, we focused on
Internet ventures. These are defined as
ventures that use “…Internet
technology in their business to re-form
markets for known products and
services as well as those that use the
Internet to pursue breakthrough market
opportunities” (adapted from Chaganti
et. al, 2008).
Also, we defined failed ventures
as ventures that exited their businesses
and closed doors permanently. The exit
might have occurred via bankruptcy or
voluntary liquidation of business by
selling some or all parts of their assets
to meet financial obligations of the
ventures.
Internet technology space is
comprised of a wide array of ventures
using a variety of business models –
portals and search engines, at one end,
and on-line banks, pharmacies and
retailers, at the other end, and
combinations of the two ends in
between. Day, Fein, and Ruppersberger
(2003), in their study on shakeouts in
digital markets, reported that odds of
failure Internet ventures depend on the
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

business model of the Internet ventures.
Accordingly, to identify the pathways
of failed and non-failed new ventures,
we followed the following steps in the
study design:
Step 1. From a list of 227 new
Internet ventures that were tracked by
Pegasus Research International, an
independent investment research firm,
and reported by Willoughby in
Barron’s magazine (Willoughby,
2000), we identified 28 ventures that
failed during 1995-2003. As
mentioned earlier, failure meant that
the business venture ceased to operate.
For example, ventures acquired by
another company were not included.
Step 2. Each failed venture
identified in Step 1 above, was matched
with a non-failed Internet venture by
selecting the non-failed venture on two
important yardsticks: 1) both failed and
non-failed ventures had same business
model, and 2) both types of ventures
completed initial public offering (IPO)
during the same calendar year. The
ventures were matched on the year of
IPO to ensure that the failed and nonfailed ventures experienced similar
economic conditions and financial
markets during the IPO. But the nonfailed venture was in existence by the
end of 2003.
Business models have been
distinguished on a number of
dimensions, such as, where the
business is located in the supply chain,
the type of market on which it focuses,
whether it sells directly on line, types
of revenue sources, types of resources
and assets used, and their cost
structures (Applegate 2001; Applegate
and Collura 2000). These dimensions
are important contextual factors that
influence venture performance and are
likely to be similar among new
 209

<-----Page 4----->ventures that are based upon a similar
business model. For matching the
venture pairs on the business model, we
followed the business model typology
suggested by Applegate and Collura
(2000). They identified four main
business models: commerce, content,
community, and infrastructure.
Commerce revenue is generated from
the sale of physical products, license of
information-based products (e.g.
software), or service and transaction
fees. Content revenue is realized from
subscription and registration fees.
Community revenue is collected from
advertising activities, referral fees, and
membership fees. Infrastructure
revenue is generated from the sale (or
license) of technology products,
installation or integration fees,
maintenance fees, hosting fees, and
access fees.
A matched-pair design is an
accepted method when examining why
similar subjects have different
outcomes (Schnatterly 2003). The
design is favored in studies where
confounding variables may have a very
strong effect. It is particularly useful in
contexts where the effects of a
particular variable are difficult to
untangle from other possible effects.
For each venture identified in
Steps 1 and 2, we tracked the events –
IPO-related events, portfolio-related
events, organization-related events, and
management-related events – that
occurred and time line of the events.
Data for the study were extracted from
FACTIVA – a news archival source
that continuously tracks news items and
reports from major print media,
including Wall Street Journal, New
York Times. It includes archives of
public and private ventures. For each
failed venture, we tracked
developments from the date on which
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

the venture announced its IPO to the
date on which it declared its liquidation
or bankruptcy. For each non-failed
venture we tracked the events from the
time of IPO to the three years (12
quarters) later. The grid used to trace
the events in each venture is presented
in Table 1.
While 28 Internet new ventures
that completed IPO during 1995-2003
were liquidated by 2003, detailed news
reports chronicling their histories have
been very difficult to find. At the time
writing of writing, we were able to
complete collection and analyses of
news ‘stories’ on three failed ventures
in Step 1 and four pairs of failed and
non-failed ventures in Step 2. Names of
the ventures analyzed in this paper are
listed in Table 2.
STUDY FINDINGS
Overall, the failed ventures that
we examined were founded in 1995 and
1996, announced IPO around 1999, and
completed multiple rounds of private
funding prior to IPO. Since the
announcement of IPO, failed ventures
received awards and recognitions,
formed alliances with technical,
marketing and promotional partners,
and made top management changes.
According to the statements of the
founders and the founding team
members of the failed ventures, scale of
operations is viewed as key to
profitability.
Further, our examination of
failed ventures suggests two specific
behavioral markers:
1. Founders and founding team
members expressed a strong sense
of optimism and confidence in their
business models and odds of their
success. Here are a few examples of
this sense of confidence:

are critical to achieving scale and
customer satisfaction.”

to weather the storm."

“We don't have serious

2.

Another behavioral marker of
failed ventures was: vacillation
around the IPO decision. The
series of events surrounding
IPO in the three failed ventures,
presented in Figure 1, show that
there was back and forth on the
decision to go public and its
timing.

Pathways to failure
Turning to the pathways that
distinguish failed and non-failed
ventures, trace events that occurred in
the failed and non-failed ventures over
twelve consecutive quarters are
presented in Figures 2 A and 2B
Based on an examination of the
sequence of events, the pathway to
failure of new ventures is as follows:
1. Complexity. Pathways of new
ventures that failed included the
complete suite of events –
finance-related, organizationrelated, and portfolio-related
events, followed by
management-related events. In
contrast to the above, pathways
of the non-failed ventures were
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

relatively simple. They included
primarily portfolio-related
events and, to a lesser extent,
organization-related events. As
such, pathways of the failed
ventures were more complex
than the pathways of the nonfailed ventures.
2. Pace of events. Along the
pathways to failure
entrepreneurs were engaged in a
wide array. In contrast to the
above, traffic on the pathways
of the non-failing ventures was
relatively light: entrepreneurs in
the non-failing ventures were
dealing with one set of events at
a time, e.g., portfolio-related
events followed by
organization-related events.
3. Level of activity. Failed new
ventures were engaged in
relatively high number of
events whereas non-failed
ventures were engaged in
relatively low number of events.
We are unable to make any
comments on statistical significance of
the differences between the pathways
of the failed and the non-failed
ventures, as the number of cases
reported on in the paper is rather low.
Implications and Concluding Remarks
Going public involves a series
of changes – finance-related, portfoliorelated, organization-related, and
management-related. Some of the
changes may prepare the venture to
successfully complete its IPO. Some
other changes, notably the changes
made after the IPO, may be aimed at
maintaining or enhancing the
performance of the new venture as a
public entity. In this paper we focused
on the changes that entrepreneurs make
shortly after completing IPO.
 212

<-----Page 7----->Specifically, we explored the markers
of failed ventures and differences
between the pathways of failed and
non-failed ventures.
Based on the case studies
examined in the paper, we found two
markers that distinguish the failed and
the non-failed ventures:
1. Degree of optimism and
confidence in the business
model. The exaggerated sense
of optimism as a marker of
failed ventures is consistent
with earlier research writings:
Kahneman and Lavallo (1994),
writing on timid choices and
bold forecasts, suggest that
entrepreneurs tend to have
“cognitive blind spot” and
overestimate their prospects
based on their own ambitious
plans rather than on their own
or others’ past experience. A
possible result of such
exaggerated sense of optimism
and self-confidence is that the
founders and their ventures land
in trouble. In a similar vein,
Krueger and Dickson (1994),
writing on the risks of
“believing in ourselves”,
showed that executives who are
led to believe that they are
“competent” tend to engage in
risk behavior and vice versa.
Awards and recognitions that
the newly minted IPOs receive
can contribute to the perverse
effects.
2. Degree of hesitancy on the
decision to go public and timing
of the decision to go public.
This finding was consistent
with the Hambrick and
D’Aveni’s (1988) findings that
firms that are under stress, e.g.,
new ventures and ventures that
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

are about to go public, vacillate
between action vs. no action,
and even engage in certain
initiatives that may be rather
extreme. Such vacillation is a
marker of stress and likely
impending failure.
With respect to the pathways to
failure, we found that pathways
of failed ventures and nonfailed ventures were different:
pathways of the failed ventures
were relatively complex, and
both pace of events and level of
activity along the pathways
were relatively high. In contrast
to the failed-ventures, the nonfailed ventures seemed to
maintain a very simple agenda,
attend to one change at a time
and keep the change activity
level low.
What might explain the
differences in the pathways of the
failed and the non-failed ventures? One
plausible explanation is: Entrepreneurs
who are contemplating an IPO engage
in a wide array of changes – financerelated, portfolio-related, organizationrelated, and management-related
changes. However, in a rush to seize
the opportunities presented by the
capital markets and to be the first to go
public the entrepreneurs may choose to
just do the minimal preparation for an
IPO event and hold-off on the other
changes until after the IPO is
completed. The pathways of failed
ventures, compared to the pathways of
the non-failed ventures, imply that
failed ventures may have had more
‘unfinished’ business; or their
preparations were still “in progress.”
Even with strategic changes
initiated prior to the IPO event,
entrepreneurs often find it necessary to
engage in a series of post-IPO rounds
 213

<-----Page 8----->of changes for a variety of reasons: the
changes made prior to IPO were not
appropriate to the post-IPO situation or
the changes were executed rather
poorly.
Based on the case studies
examined in this paper we cannot
pinpoint as to whether the failed
ventures were not ready in first place,
i.e., the preparations were not
complete, the initiatives were not
appropriate, or the situation warranted a
second round of initiatives.
Further, the array of events
faced by the newly minted public
ventures was rather risky: Relatively
high complexity along the pathways
gives entrepreneurs opportunities to
engage in initiatives that would raise
the odds of failure. The rapid pace of
events along the pathways is relevant to
the way entrepreneurs allocate their
time and attention to the events.
Managing a wide array of events in a
concurrent fashion stresses
entrepreneurs of the newly minted
public ventures and seems to risk the
very survival of the ventures. And,
elevated level of activities along the
pathways suggests that the ventures are
under stress. As reported by Hambrick
and D’Aveni (1988) firms that are
under “stress” tend to launch many
more initiatives than their counter parts
that are under less stress. Again, the
rapid pace of events that occurred
among failed ventures suggests that
hyperactivity comes at a cost.
One implication of these early
findings seems to be that organizations
that carry out pre-IPO scrutiny of new
ventures need to be vigilant regarding
the level of preparation among venture
candidates. As we conduct additional
collection of news reports on failed and
non-failed new Internet ventures and
complete the analysis, we hope to
Small Business Institute® National Proceedings 
Vol. 33, No. 1   Winter, 2009 

verify these findings and arrive at
conclusions that are generalizable to
the larger population of failed vis a vis
non-failed ventures.
