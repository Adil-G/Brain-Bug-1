FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS AS A MODERATOR IN THE CURVILINEAR
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN JOB DEMANDS, AND JOB
PERFORMANCE AND JOB SATISFACTION
ONNE JANSSEN
University of Groningen
Activation theory suggests that intermediate rather than low or high levels of quantitative job demands benefit job performance and job satisfaction among managers.
Using an equity theory framework, I hypothesize that perceptions of effort-reward
fairness moderate these inverted U-shaped demand-response relationships. In support
of this hypothesis, survey results demonstrate that managers who perceive effortreward fairness perform better and feel more satisfied in response to intermediate
levels of job demands than managers who perceive "underreward unfairness."
lationships. Recent research has only started exploring how curvilinear relationships between
variations in job design and job performer responses are shaped by work context conditions
such as pay and supervisory satisfaction (Champoux, 1992) and demands-ability fit (Xie & Johns,
1995). Champoux (1992) found several different
moderating effects, especially of pay satisfaction, at
low and high levels of job scope. Examples of these
moderating effects are a negative enhancement effect (people doing low-scope jobs provided lower
affective responses when pay satisfaction was also
low); a compensatory effect (people doing lowscope jobs provided higher affective responses
when pay satisfaction was high; and a positive
enhancement effect (people doing high-scope jobs
provided higher affective responses when pay satisfaction was also high). The context of?pay satisfaction had little effect in the middle range of job
scope. Xie and Johns (1995) found that a job holder's perceptions of the fit between job demands and
his or her ability (demands-ability fit) moderated
the U-shaped curvilinear relationship between job
scope and stress. That is, people with high-scope
jobs who perceived demands-ability fit experienced less exhaustion and anxiety than those perceiving misfit.
The purpose of this study was to contribute to the
literature on moderating job-contextual influences
by examining the effect of perceptions of fairness
on curvilinear demand-response
relationships.
More specifically, taking an equity theory perspective (Adams, 1963, 1965), I propose that the inverted U-shaped relationships between job demands and job performance and job satisfaction are
contingent upon perceptions of the ratio between
the effort spent and the rewards received at work.
Managers who perceive job effort and rewards to be

Job demands on management employees typically constitute a broad variety of role obligations.
Yukl, Wall, and Lepsinger (1990) identified no
fewer than 14 categories of management behaviors:
informing, consulting, planning and organizing,
problem solving, clarifying, monitoring, motivating, recognizing, supporting, conflict management
and team building, networking, delegating, rewarding, and mentoring. All these actions are assumed
to be required of managers ranging from first-line
supervisors to CEOs, although their relative importance differs by organizational level (Hogan, Curphy, & Hogan, 1994).
An intriguing question is how the amount of job
demands imposed on managers affects their behavioral and affective responses. According to activation theory, there will be inverted U-shaped relationships between job demands and both job
performance and job satisfaction (Gardner, 1986;
Gardner & Cummings, 1988; Scott, 1966). That is,
an increase in job demands is assumed to be beneficial for job performance and job satisfaction to,
but not beyond, a certain level; after attainment of
that optimum level of job demands, job performance and job satisfaction should start to decline.
Activation theory has been modified to account for
empirical findings that individual differences in
extraversion and electrodermal lability moderate
the curvilinear effects of job design on physiological, behavioral, and affective responses of job performers (Gardner, 1986; Gardner & Cummings,
1988). Unfortunately, little is known about the
job-contextual factors that moderate curvilinear re-

fairly balanced (job effort-reward fairness) are argued to perform better and feel more satisfied in
response to intermediate levels of job demands
than managers who perceive an imbalance (underreward unfairness).
Job demands is a multifaceted construct consisting of quantitative and qualitative role obligations.
Quantitative job demands refer to the degree to
which employees are required to work fast and
hard and have much work to do in a short time, or
permanently have a great deal of work to do; qualitative job demands refer to having to deal with role
ambiguity and/or with conflicting role demands,
such as those that have been labeled "person-role
conflict," "intrasender conflict," and "intersender
conflict" (cf. Ganster & Fusilier, 1989; Karasek,
1979; Katz & Kahn, 1966; Rabinowitz & Stumpf,
1987). Using broad definitions and measurements
that mix up quantitative and qualitative aspects
may produce unclear theory on the nature and consequences of job demands or may blur relationships between separate facets of job demands with
specific responses. To avoid such conceptual problems, in this study I exclusively concentrated on
quantitative job demands, leaving role ambiguity
and role conflict out of further consideration.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Curvilinear Demand-Response Relationships
Activation theory has been used to explain the
effects of variations in job design on physiological,
behavioral, and affective responses (Gardner, 1986;
Gardner & Cummings, 1988; Scott, 1966). Central to
the theory is the concept of activation level, defined as "the degree of neural activity in the reticular activation system, a major part of the central
nervous system" (Gardner, 1986: 411). The idea
that demand-response relationships are curvilinear
borrows from two important propositions about activation level. First, each individual is assumed to
have a characteristic level of activation, which is
the level of activation that allows the central nervous system to function most efficiently, resulting
in enhanced cerebral and behavioral performance
and positive affect. As the experienced activation
level deviates negatively or positively from the
characteristic activation level, central nervous system efficiency is diminished, causing decreases in
performance and positive affect (Gardner, 1986;
Gardner & Cummings, 1988).
Second, job demands "differ in terms of the resulting experienced level of activation of the job
performer" (Gardner & Cummings, 1988: 87). Jobs
with low demands provide low activation levels,

and jobs with high demands provide high activation levels. Given that job demands result in different activation levels, the prediction of curvilinear
demand-response relationship is straightforward.
That is, job performance and job satisfaction are
predicted to decline in proportion to the degree to
which a job performer's experienced activation
level negatively or positively deviates from the
characteristic activation level owing to job underload and job overload, respectively (cf. Gardner &
Cummings, 1988).
As mentioned above, managerial jobs constitute a
complex set of role obligations with high information-processing requirements. Gardner and Cummings (1988) suggested that the predicted invertedU-shaped demand-performance relationships are
more likely to be found for complex jobs than for
simple or easy jobs. The justification for this impact
of job content is that "high and low activation levels impair the ability to process information, by
lowering information processing capacity" (Gardner & Cummings, 1988: 89). In the case of simple
jobs in which little information needs to be processed, extremes in activation level due to job underload or overload are not likely to have much
impact on performance because little informationprocessing capacity is needed. However, in complex managerial jobs with high informationprocessing requirements, extremes in activation
level do cause performance decrements by lowering information-processing capacity when it is especially necessary.
Applied to the area of job design, activation theory has been supported by empirical research
demonstrating a linear relationship between task
difficulty and activation level, and an inverted-Ushaped relationship between activation level and
task satisfaction (Baschera & Grandjean, 1979).
Moreover, inverted U-shaped relationships have
been found between job stimulation and job performance (Gardner, 1986) and between job complexity
and affective outcomes (Champoux, 1980, 1992).
Following this line of research, the present study
applies activation theory to assume inverted-Ushaped relationships of job demands with job performance and job satisfaction among managers. Departing from this assumption, this study examines
the possibility that these curvilinear relationships
are influenced by perceptions of job effort-reward
fairness.
Fairness Perceptions as a Moderator of
Curvilinear Demand-Response Relationships
Equity theory (Adams, 1963, 1965; Mowday,
1991) suggests that perceptions of fairness are a

<-----Page 3----->2001

job-related motivational base that can influence the
behavioral and affective responses of job performers. According to equity theory, employees evaluate the exchange relationships with the organizations they are affiliated with in terms of a ratio
between effort spent and rewards recieved at work.
Job efforts include comprehensive investments,
such as intelligence, experience, training, skill, and
seniority, and specific work actions needed for task
fulfilment. Job rewards, on the other hand, refer to
inducements an employee may receive from an organization, including money, desired job-related
responsibilities, esteem, status, and social identity
(Adams, 1965). Perceived inequity resulting from
job effort-reward discrepancies provides an unpleasant emotional state requiring the worker to
reduce this tension. To diminish perceived inequity, a worker may actually alter efforts or rewards,
may cognitively reframe efforts and rewards, may
withdraw from the job, or may change comparison
dimensions (Adams, 1965; Dittrich & Carrell, 1979;
Mowday, 1991). Inequity can reflect underreward
or overreward unfairness. In employee-employer
exchange relationships, employees are more likely
to perceive underreward unfairness than overreward unfairness. Moreover, the reactions of workers to the former appear to be much more intense
than their reactions to the latter (Mowday, 1991).
Therefore, this study focuses on equity perceptions
regarding the difference between effort-reward fairness and underreward unfairness and does not deal
with overreward unfairness.
On the basis of activation theory, I argue that
intermediate rather than low or high levels of job
demands result in higher levels of job performance
among managers. However, the extent to which a
manager actually performs better in response to
intermediate levels of job demands might be regulated by fairness perceptions of the ratio between
effort spent and reward received at work. Responding to job demands with good performance implies
job investments such as intelligence, experience,
energy, and time expended on appropriate work
actions. A manager who judges that effort does pay
will be driven to perform well in response to job
demands. However, when job efforts are perceived
as not being proportional to job rewards, management employees will be inclined to restrict job investments. In such an unfair situation, the performance enhancement effect that occurs in the case
of intermediate job demands is expected to be impaired by the tension of restricting job efforts in
order to reduce underreward unfairness. In other
words, a manager is assumed to have different options for performing her or his side of the exchange
process to which the organization contributes re-

wards. In this exchange process, managers who feel
fairly treated are likely to perform better in response to intermediate job demands than managers
who are underrewarded by their organization.
Fairness perceptions might also affect the curvilinear demand-satisfaction relationship. Although
characteristic activation level differs across individuals, in general, intermediate rather than extreme job demands are likely to cause experienced
activation levels that are closer to the characteristic
activation levels of job performers, and, therefore,
result in higher levels of job satisfaction (cf. Champoux, 1992; Gardner & Cummings, 1988). This satisfaction enhancement effect in the case of intermediate job demands might be moderated by
perceptions of effort-reward fairness. Perceptions
of a fairly balanced reciprocity of efforts and rewards reinforce a manager's self-regulatory functions, his or her sense of mastery, efficiacy, and
esteem, and will therefore serve as a beneficial condition for affective job responses (cf. Siegrist, 1996).
As a consequence, the interaction of perceptions of
a fair effort-reward ratio with intermediate job demands can be expected to provide high levels of job
satisfaction, since managers are pleased to be doing
a properly active job for which they are fairly rewarded. This balanced job situation enhances feelings of control over occupational life, producing
job satisfaction (cf. Adams, 1963, 1965; Dittrich &
Carrell, 1979; Mowday, 1991; Siegrist, 1996). However, perceptions of underreward unfairness are
expected to impair the positive effect of intermediate levels of job demands on job satisfaction. In
terms of equity theory, managers will be less satisfied if they perceive their efforts as being disproportionate to their rewards. A context they evaluate
negatively in terms of rewards is likely to distract
them from the positive qualities of intermediate job
demands. The unbalanced effort-reward ratio undermines feelings of control over the job situation,
causing a decrease in job dissatisfaction (cf. Siegrist, 1996).
In sum, perceptions of fairness conceivably moderate the curvilinear relationships between job demands and job performance and job satisfaction
among managers. To test this moderator effect, I
formulated the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. Fairness perceptions moderate
inverted U-shaped demand-response relationships in such a way that managers who perceive effort-rewardfairness produce higher levels of job performance and job satisfaction in
response to intermediate job demands than
managers who perceive underreward unfairness.

METHODS
Sample and Procedures
A sample of 134 low-level and midlevel management employees from a Dutch industrial organization in the food sector received a questionnaire
through regular mail. This sample of management
employees was randomly selected from diverse
units representing all functions and departments of
the company. Ninety-nine completed questionnaires were returned, representing a response rate
of 74 percent. The respondents were all men and
had an average age of 45.33 years (s.d. = 7.71) and
a mean company tenure of 6.98 years (s.d. = 5.87).
Eleven percent of the respondents had at the most a
primary education; 46 percent, an initial vocational
education; 21 percent, a higher vocational education (at a level equivalent to college); and 22 percent, postgraduate degrees.
As Warr (1990) noted, to test theoretical expectations of nonlinear relationships, a wide range of
different jobs is needed so that job demands ranging from low to high are included. So, to ensure
variety of job demands, I surveyed low- and
midlevel management employees from a variety of
departments, including purchasing, logistics, order
processing, production, maintenance, quality control, research, marketing, engineering, and administration. The respondents provided self-reports of
job demands, fairness perceptions, and job satisfaction. Since supervisors play a pivotal part in appraisal and reward systems, a manager's job performance might be best rated by his or her supervisor.
Therefore, respondents delivered a second questionnaire for measuring individual job performance
to their immediate supervisors. The latter filled out
the questionnaire and sent it back to me by regular
mail. Supervisor ratings were obtained from 60 of
the 99 management employees in the sample. Additionally, respondents provided self-reports for
the particular aspect of innovative job performance
(see Measures). Exploratory analyses revealed that
the group of respondents for whom supervisor ratings were obtained (n = 60) did not significantly
differ from the group of respondents without supervisor ratings (n = 39) with respect to age (t = -0.94,
n.s.), company tenure (t = 1.45, n.s.), education (t =
-0.35, n.s.), job demands (t = -0.83, n.s.), perceived effort-reward fairness (t = -1.38, n.s.), work
satisfaction (t = -0.45, n.s.), and supervisory satisfaction (t = -0.23, n.s.).
Measures
Job demands. Perceived quantitative job demands were assessed by eight items from a Dutch

October

scale developed and validated by Van Veldhoven
and Meijman (1994). The items were: (1) "Do you
have to work fast?" (2) "Do you have too much
work to do?" (3) "Do you have to work extra hard to
finish a task?" (4) "Do you work under time pressure?" (5) "Can you do your work in comfort?" (6)
"Do you have to deal with a backlog at work?" (7)
"Do you have problems with the pace of work?"
and (8) "Do you have problems with the workload?" Item 5 is reverse-coded. Items were rated on
a four-point Likert scale ranging from "never" (1) to
"always" (4). The Cronbach's alpha of the summative scale was .79.
Fairness perceptions. Perceptions of job effortreward fairness were measured by six statements
(cf. VanYperen, 1996), each of which was followed
by a seven-point response scale ranging from "totally disagree" (1) to "totally agree" (7). The items
were: (1) "I work too hard considering my outcomes"; (2) "I give a great deal of time and attention
to the organization, but do not feel appreciated"; (3)
"I invest more in my job than I receive in return";
(4) "The rewards I receive are not proportional to
my investments"; (5) "I put more energy into my
job than it is worth"; (6) "I feel unfairly treated in
my job." All responses were reverse-coded, so that
higher ratings indicated more perceived effortreward fairness. Scale reliability was .90.
Job perfomnance. Given the diverse jobs represented in the sample, no common objective assessments of job performance were available, or even
possible. Therefore, a two-dimensional scale was
created for the assessment of standard and innovative job performance. Standard job performance refers to the extent to which a management employee
fulfills organizationally prescribed work role expectations (Katz & Kahn, 1966). However, "an organization which depends solely upon its blueprints of prescribed behavior is a very fragile social
system" (Katz, 1964: 132). To cope with global
competition and environmental uncertainty, an organization needs managers who exceed their standard work behaviors by generating, promoting, and
realizing new ideas for organizational change. Innovative job performance in the workplace is
widely claimed to be crucial for the effective functioning of organizations (Kanter, 1988; Katz &
Kahn, 1966; Woodman, Sawyer, & Griffin, 1993).
Standard job performance was measured by a
Dutch translation (Van Yperen & De Jong, 1997) of
Podsakoff and MacKenzie's (1989) five-item scale
for in-role job performance. Respondents' immediate supervisors indicated the extent to which they
agreed or disagreed with the following five statements: (1) "This worker always completes the duties specified in his/her job description," (2) "This

<-----Page 5----->2001

worker fulfills all responsibilities required by his/
her job," (3) "This worker often fails to perform
essential duties," (4) "This worker never neglects
aspects of the job that he/she is obligated to perform," and (5) "This worker meets all the formal
performance requirements of the job." Item 3 is
reversed. The response format ranged from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly agree" (7).
Innovative job performance was assessed by nine
items based on Scott and Bruce's (1994) scale for
individual innovative behavior in the workplace,
which draws on Kanter's (1988) work on the stages
of innovation. Three items refer to idea generation
("creating new ideas for improvements," "searching out new working methods, techniques, or instruments," and "generating original solutions to
problems"); three items refer to idea promotion
("mobilizing support for innovative ideas," "acquiring approval for innovative ideas," and "making important organizational members enthusiastic
for innovative ideas"); and three items refer to idea
realization ("transforming innovative ideas into
useful applications," "introducing innovative ideas
into the work environment in a systemic way," and
"evaluating the utility of innovate ideas"). Immediate supervisors rated how often respondents performed the nine innovative work behaviors in the
workplace. The response format ranged from
"never" (1) to "always" (7).
A principal axis factor analysis using oblique
rotation of the items revealed the expected twofactor structure, which accounted for 77 percent of
the variance. The two factors appropriately represented the standard job performance and innovative job performance items. Primary loadings exceeded .76, and cross-loadings were lower than .11.
Adequate reliabilities were achieved for both standard job performance (a = .85, after deletion of
item 4) and innovative job performance (a = .96).
The management employees were asked to provide self-reports on the nine-item innovative job
performance scale in addition to their supervisors'
ratings for three reasons. First, the assessment of
discretionary innovative performance is much like
many forms of subjective performance appraisal,
highly susceptible to idiosyncratic interpretations
and thus likely to vary across different raters (Organ & Konovsky, 1989). Second, a management employee's cognitive representation and reports of his
or her own innovative performance may be more
subtle than those of his or her supervisor, since a
manager has much more information about the historical, contextual, intentional, and other backgrounds of his or her own work activities (cf. Jones
& Nisbett, 1971). Finally, the supervisor measure
may miss genuine innovative activities of the man-

Janssen

1043

agement employee involved, and may capture only
those gestures intended to impress the supervisor
(Organ & Konovsky, 1989). So, although the supervisor scores provide a performance assessment that
is procedurally independent of the respondents
scores on job demands and fairness perceptions,
the self-reports might be more subtle than the supervisor scores. The Cronbach's alpha of the selfreport scale of innovative job performance was .92.
Below, the self-reports and supervisor scores are
labeled "self-rated" and "leader-rated," respectively.
Job satisfaction. As a managerial job constitutes
sets of work actions, a manager's affective responses to the substance and results of those work
activities are assumed to be a critical part of job
satisfaction (cf. Smith, Kendall, & Hulin, 1969).
Additionally, a manager's immediate supervisor is
likely to be the most important representative of the
organization she or he has to deal with concerning
a variety of job-related issues, including the determination of job demands (Smith et al., 1969).
Therefore, satisfaction with work and the immediate supervisor were assessed as features of job satisfaction. The question "How satisfied or dissatisfied are your with . . ?" was followed by four items
on work satisfaction ("your work performance,"
"the quality of your work performance," "the way
you perform your work," "the way you carry out
your work activities") and three items on supervisory satisfaction ("your collaboration with your
supervisor," "the support you get from your supervisor," and "the support you give to your supervisor"). Items were rated from "very dissatisfied" (1)
to "very satisfied" (7). A factor analysis using principal components extraction and oblique rotation
yielded the expected two-factor solution, accounting for 76 percent of the variance. The two factors
constituted the appropriate items, with primary
loadings higher than .71 and cross-loadings lower
than .20. Reliabilities for work and supervisory satisfaction were .85 and .91, respectively.
Covariates. To control for the possibility that
sociodemographic differences in the predictor and
outcome variables might lead to spurious relationships, age (in years), organization tenure (in years),
and education (1 = "primary education," 2 = "initial vocational education," 3 = "higher vocational
education," and 4 = "postgraduate degree") were
entered as covariates in the analysis. Older managers who have been affiliated with an organization a
long time can be plateaued, which could influence
the allocation and perceptions of job demands, perceptions of effort-reward fairness, job performance,
and job satisfaction. Moreover, level of education
can be critical for enhancing job performance, es-

linear X2Z term was added to test the hypothesis
that the curvilinear relationships of job demands
with job performance and job satisfaction vary as a
function of perceptions of job effort-reward fairness.

Data Analysis
Since the independent variables were continuous, I conducted hierarchical multiple regression
analyses to test the hypothesis of quadratic-jobdemands-by-linear-fairness-perceptions interaction
effects on the dependent variables of job performance and job satisfaction (cf. Aiken & West, 1991;
Cohen & Cohen, 1983). To facilitate testing of quadratic and interaction effects, standardized independent variables were used.
To test the hypothesized quadratic-by-linear interaction between job demands (X) and fairness
perceptions (Z) the following equation should be
used: Y= b1X + b2X2 + b3Z + b4XZ + b5X2Z + co
(cf. Aiken & West, 1991). The predictors were entered into the regression equation in six successive
steps. In the first step, I entered age, company tenure, and level of education to control for possible
confounding effects. In the second and third steps,
the linear (X) and quadratic (X2) terms of job demands were successively added to detect linear
and quadratic main effects. In the fourth and fifth
steps, fairness perceptions as a linear moderator (Z)
and the linear interaction between job demands
and fairness perceptions (XZ) were entered, respectively. In the sixth and final step, the quadratic-by-

RESULTS
Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and
zero-order Pearson correlations among all variables. Job demands were not linearly related to the
measures of job performance and job satisfaction,
with the exception of a significantly negative association between job demands and work satisfaction
(r = -.21, p < .05). There were no significant
correlations between fairness perceptions and the
scales of job performance, but fairness perceptions
appeared to be positively related to supervisory
satisfaction (r = .20, p < .05). Furthermore, standard job performance correlated only modestly
with leader-rated innovative job performance (r =
.33, p < .01), indicating that these variables reflect
different elements of observed job performance.
The moderate correlation between leader-rated and
self-rated innovative job performance (r = .27, p <
.05) is consistent with earlier research findings concerning self-reports and supervisor judgments of
employee work behavior (Harris & Schaubroeck,
1988).

Test of the Demand-Fairness Hypothesis
I conducted hierarchical multiple regression
analyses to test the quadratic-by-linear interaction
of job demands and fairness perceptions with the
job response variables of job performance and job
satisfaction separately dependent (see Table 2). All
regressions met the major model assumptions; that
is, no serious violations were found in the plots of
standardized residuals as compared to the predicted values, in the normal probability plots of
standardized residuals, and with regard to the independence of error terms (the Durbin-Watson statistic ranged from 1.77 for job satisfaction to 2.02
for supervisor-rated innovative job performance).
Job performance. Entering the control variables
of age, company tenure, and education into
the regression yielded significant equations for
standard job performance (AR2 = .20, p < .01),
leader-rated innovative job performance (AR2 =
.22, p < .01), and self-rated innovative job performance (AR2 = .13, p < .01). Company tenure appeared to be negatively related to standard job performance (b = -0.38, p < .05), and education was
positively associated with leader-rated innovative
job performance (b = 0.63, p < .001) and self-rated
innovative job performance (b = 0.33, p < .01). In
step 2, the main effect of job demands was entered,
which was predictive for none of the measures of
job performance. The quadratic term of job demands was entered in step 3. This block was not
predictive for standard job performance and selfrated innovative job performance, but it reached
significance for leader-rated innovative job performance (AR2 = .09, p < .05). In steps 4 and 5,
fairness perceptions and the demands-fairness interaction were successively entered. These blocks
were not predictive. Finally, in step 6, the quadratic-by-linear interaction of job demands and fairness perceptions was entered. This interaction was
significant for standard job performance (AR2 = .07,
p < .05), leader-rated innovative job performance
(AR2 = .09, p < .05), and self-rated innovative job
performance (AR2 = .07, p < .01).
To further analyze this quadratic-by-linear interaction effect, I tested simple slopes of the regression curves corresponding to all possible combinations of low (one standard deviation below the
mean), medium (mean), and high (one standard
deviation over the mean) levels of job demands
with perceptions of effort-reward fairness and underreward unfairness (cf. Aiken & West, 1991). In
the case of effort-reward fairness, the simple slope
of the regression curve had a positive value at low
levels of job demands for standard job performance
(b = 1.09, t = 2.22, p K .05), leader-rated innovative

job performance (b = 2.17, t = 3.33, p < .01), and
self-rated innovative job performance (b = 1.12, t =
3.59, p < .001) and did not significantly differ from
zero at medium levels of job demands for standard
job performance (b = 0.18, t = 0.88, n.s.), leaderrated innovative job performance (b = 0.18, t =
0.66, n.s.), and self-rated innovative job performance (b = 0.30, t = 1.75, n.s.). At high levels of job
demands, the simple slope had a significantly negative value for leader-rated innovative job performance (b = -1.82, t = -3.05, p < .01), and a
negative but nonsignificant value for standard job
performance (b = -0.74, t = -1.64, p = .11) and
self-rated innovative job performance (b = -0.52,
t = -1.46, p = .14). Additional analyses revealed
that for very highly demanding jobs (two standard
deviations over the mean), the simple slope of the
regression curve had a nearly significant negative
value for standard job performance (b = -1.65, t =
-1.94, p = .06) and a significant, negative value for
self-rated innovative job performance (b = -1.34,
t = -2.16, p < .05).
In the case of underreward unfairness, the simple
slope of the regression line did not significantly
differ from zero at low, medium, and high values of
job demands for standard job performance, leaderrated innovative job performance, and self-rated
innovative job performance. To facilitate interpretation of the quadratic-by-linear interaction effect,
Figure 1 illustrates how the relationships of job
demands with the measures of job performance do
indeed follow the inverted U-shaped function in
the case of effort-reward fairness, whereas this curvilinearity does not emerge for underreward unfairness. These findings provide support for Hypothesis 1.
Job satisfaction. Entering the control variables of
age, company tenure, and education into the regression yielded a significant equation for work satisfaction (R2 = .10, F = 3.33, p < .05), whereas this
block was not predictive for supervisory satisfaction. Better-educated managers reported themselves to be less satisfied with work (b = -0.19, p <
.05). None of the steps (2-5) in which job demands,
quadratic job demands, fairness perceptions, and
the interaction between job demands and fairness
perceptions were successively entered approached
significance. However, adding the quadratic-bylinear interaction of job demands and fairness perceptions was significant for both work satisfaction
(AR2 = .12, AF = 14.91, p < .001) and supervisory
satisfaction (AR2 = .09, AF = 10.54, p < .01).
In addition, simple slopes of the regression
curves were tested corresponding to all possible
combinations of low, medium, and high levels of
job demands with perceptions of effort-reward fair-

for either work satisfaction (b = -0.21, t = -1.98,
n.s.) or supervisory satisfaction (b = -0.18, t =
-0.91, n.s.). At high levels of job demands, the
regression curve significantly declined for both
work satisfaction (b = -0.98, t = -4.40, p < .001)
and supervisory satisfaction (b = -1.31, t = -3.29,
p < .01). In terms of underreward fairness, the
simple slopes of the regression line did not significantly differ from zero at low, medium, and highvalues of job demands for both measures of job
satisfaction. As can be clearly seen in Figure 1, the
relationships of job demands with work and supervisory satisfaction vary in form according to fairness perceptions. More specifically, if there is a
fair balance between efforts and rewards, the relationships follow an inverted U-shaped function, with the most work and supervisory satisfaction found at intermediate
levels of job
demands and satisfaction decrements occurring
at lower and higher levels of job demands. However, with underreward unfairness, intermediate
job demands did not provide increments in work
or supervisory satisfaction. These findings also
support the hypothesis.

DISCUSSION
This study's proposal is that perceptions of fairness moderate the inverted U-shaped relationships
between amounts of quantitative job demands and
job responses among management employees. As
expected, survey results demonstrate that managers
who perceive effort-reward fairness perform better
and feel more satisfied in response to intermediate
levels of job demands than managers who perceive
underreward unfairness.
As delineated in the theoretical section, application of activation theory to the area of job design
(e.g., Champoux, 1980, 1992; Gardner, 1986; Gardner & Cummings, 1988; Scott, 1966; Xie & Johns,
1995) provides an explanation for the curvilinear
effect of variations in job characteristics on behavioral and affective responses of job performers.
Champoux (1992) started to examine how jobcontextual factors such as pay satisfaction and supervisory satisfaction influence the curvilinear relationships between job complexity and affective
outcomes. Drawing on an equity theory framework,
this study shows how perceptions of job effort-

<-----Page 10----->1048

Academy of Management Journal

reward fairness as a job-contextual factor moderate
inverted U-shaped relationships between quantitative job demands and both job performance and job
satisfaction among managers. That is, managers
who are fairly rewarded for their efforts appear to
respond more positively to intermediate demand
levels than managers who are underrewarded by
their organization. Thus, this study contributes to
the literature on how demand-response relationships are affected by other job-contextual factors.
A growing stream of research shows workplace
fairness perceptions to be an important determinant of the behavioral and affective responses of job
performers (e.g., Konovsky & Pugh, 1994; Moorman, 1991; Mowday, 1991; Organ & Moroman,
1993). However, there has been scant attention paid
to the issue of how perceptions of fairness interact
with other job incumbent cognitions in their effect
on job responses. The moderator effect examined in
this study suggests that perceptions of effortreward fairness influence managers in their behavioral and affective responses to quantitative job demands.
In the last two decades, Karasek's (1979) linear
demand-control model has provided the underlying theoretical basis for most studies on the effects
of job demands on job holder responses (e.g.,
Fletcher & Jones, 1993; Ganster & Fusilier, 1989).
This model is based on the central notion that job
control moderates the relationship between job demands and job responses. It is thus assumed in the
model that increasing job demands in interaction
with decreasing job control produce psychological
and physiological strain and job dissatisfaction and
that increasing levels of both job demands and job
control provide active learning that enables individuals to develop new patterns of behavior
(Karasek & Theorell, 1990). Unfortunately, empirical support for the linear demand-control interaction has been inconclusive, in the sense that researchers have frequently found additional effects
of job demands and job control without evidence of
the interactive effects that are central to the model
(Fletcher & Jones, 1993). This inconclusive evidence for Karasek's job demands-control model
challenges scientists to shift their emphasis to psychological factors other than control that might
shape the relationship between job demands and
job holder responses (cf. Fletcher & Jones, 1993).
The present study shows perceptions of job effortreward fairness to be a moderator of curvilinear
relationships between job demands and job performance and job satisfaction among management employees. These findings may stimulate researchers
to draw attention to the possibilities that (1) job
demands are curvilinearly rather than linearly as-

October

sociated with job holder responses and (2) that
curvilinear demand-response relationships are
contingent upon conditional values of other job
features.
Like all research, the present study has some
limitations that need to be considered. First, drawing on activation theory, I assumed that job demands are curvilinearly related to job performance
and job satisfaction and subsequently argue and
demonstrate how perceptions of fairness moderate
these curvilinear relationships. In line with activation theory, the present results indeed demonstrate
inverted-U-shaped demand-response links contingent upon perceptions of effort-reward fairness.
However, neural activation was not measured and,
as a result, any inferences about the mediating process of activation that may clarify the curvilinear
demand-response links remain speculative. So, following recent research on job characteristics(Champoux,
employee response relationships
1992; Xie & Johns, 1995), this study applies rather
than tests activation theory to assume inverted
U-shaped links between job demands and job performance and job satisfaction among managers.
Second, the correlational evidence found does
not necessarily reflect the causality proposed. The
direction of the relationship between job demands
and job responses is unclear and may well be bidirectional. Providing higher levels of job performance obviously implies extra work activities. This
quantitative increase in workload might clarify the
increasing part of the inverted U-shaped relation
between job demands and job performance. However, for the decreasing part of the curvilinear relationship, it is hard to imagine how decrements in
job performance can cause more and more intensified job demands. This argument shades the caveat
of a bidirectional curvilinear relationship between
job demands and job performance. Nonetheless, the
demand-fairness model proposed in this study
needs further examination to figure out causality
issues. Concerns here are the study's crosssectional data and possible common method variance in the effect of the interaction between job
demands and fairness perceptions on job satisfaction, given the self-report measures used for both
the predictor and criterion variables. However, it is
hard to imagine that the respondents in this study
would have artifactually caused the complicated
quadratic-by-linear interaction effect of job demands and perceptions of fairness. Moreover, this
complicated interaction effect on job satisfaction
was identical to the effects on the measures of
standard job performance and innovative job performance rated by the immediate supervisors of the
respondents. These considerations suggest that

<-----Page 11----->Janssen

2001

common method variance cannot be a serious problem in this study.
A third limitation concerns the generalizability
of results. The sample consisted of only male participants from an industrial organization in the
food sector. Gender and particular organizational
factors might vary with job demands and perceptions of fairness and thus explain their effects.
Moreover, by focusing on quantitative rather than
qualitative job demands, this study left unanswered the question of how fairness perceptions
influence relationships between conflicting job demands (that is, person-role conflict, intrasender
conflict, and intersender conflict) and job performance and job satisfaction. Therefore, generalization of the present results to women, to other types
of organizations, and to qualitative job demands
awaits further examination.
The present results also have implications on an
applied level. An important advantage of this study
is that job demands and perceptions of job effortreward fairness are at least partly within the control
of organizations. In particular, organizations do
have control over the amount of work imposed on
and allocated across individual management positions and over the way individual managers are
rewarded for their efforts. This study proposes that
intermediate rather than extreme levels of job demands in combination with a fair fit between effort
spent and reward received at work provide beneficial conditions for job performance and job satisfaction. Thus, in terms of job design, creating a fit
between reasonable demands and fair rewards will
be particularly effective and valued.
