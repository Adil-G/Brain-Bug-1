Abstract
Angel financing is one of the most common, but least studied methods, to finance new
ventures. In this paper, I propose a model to explain angel behavior. I use a unique dataset of
angel-backed firms to test the predictions of the model and examine the characteristics of angel
financing. Although they are exposed to greater uncertainty by investing earlier in the life of
a firm compared to venture capital, angel investors do not rely on traditional control mechanisms such as board control, staging, or contractual provisions to protect against expropriation.
Instead, angels reduce expected agency costs by forcing entrepreneurs to hold a larger stake
in the firm, thereby aligning the interests of the entrepreneur with the outcome of the firm. In
addition, angels use more informal methods such as investing in close geographic proximity
and syndicating investments with other angels to mitigate risks.

<-----Page 1----->1 Introduction
With the recent rise (and fall) in the returns and prominence of new entrepreneurial ventures, much
attention has focused on the genesis of new firms. One of the most important considerations these
new entities face in the transformation from entrepreneurial ideas to revenue generating companies
is the procurement of capital. Because traditional avenues of finance such as debt are often not
available, entrepreneurs must seek risk capital by offering equity. While some companies may
be able to generate capital by forming alliances1 , most new ventures must rely on two sources of
outside equity: venture capital and angel financing.
Institutional venture capital has been glamorized in the press and academic research as the
primary source of outside equity finance. However, many studies estimate institutional venture
capital contributes less than half of the total equity financing for new firms. The less-scrutinized,
yet equally important, source of start-up capital is the informal venture capital market, known as
angel financing. While it is difficult to precisely quantify the size of the angel market due to its
informal nature, some studies estimate the size of the angel investments to be twice that of the
institutional venture capital market.2 The National Venture Capital Association assesses the size
of the angel market to be $100 billion in the United States while the institutional venture capital
market is less than half this size at $48.3 billion.3 The Small Business Association estimates that
250,000 angels commit $20 billion each year to over 30,000 private companies.4 Freear et al.
(1992) suggest angels provide the largest amount of capital among early stage financiers and fund

and Harrison (1990) find angel investors finance at least five times as many small firms as venture
capitalists.
Despite the importance of angel funding, much of what is known about angels is incomplete
and not well understood. Very few academic studies have examined angels, in part because data
on angel investment is difficult to obtain. The lack of research leaves many questions unanswered.
Specifically, why do two types of equity based start-up financing exist and do these investors operate in the same manner with respect to control? Asymmetric information and uncertainty problems
in new firms makes corporate governance very important. If angel financiers are similar to institutional venture capital, they should maintain a comparable degree of control over their investments.
Previous research has found the implementation of control mechanisms with venture capital investments to be more important as expected agency costs or uncertainty increase. Alternatively, if
angels do not behave similarly to venture capitalists with regard to the use of traditional control
rights, what mechanisms (if any) do angels use to protect themselves from expropriation?
Using a unique dataset of angel financed firms, I examine the role of angels in funding, monitoring and providing assistance to their investments. While many of my results are different from
conclusions that other researchers have found with institutional venture capital, some similarities
exist. Many of the findings are consistent with the model that I propose in the appendix. Angel
financed firms typically receive their first outside funding when the firm is less than a year old,
suggesting the degree of uncertainty is great and the need for control important. However, angel
investors do not employ the same control mechanism as venture capitalists. For example, I find
that angels seldom receive board seats in the firm the invest in. When board seats are allocated, the
founders usually retain board control, indicating board control is not the primary control mecha2

<-----Page 3----->nism utilized by angels. The allocation of board seats is not sensitive to measures of agency costs
or greater uncertainty. Gompers(1995) finds venture capitalist use staged capital infusions as a
mechanism to control agency costs. In contrast, I find little support for the use of staging in angel
investments. While some investors follow-on their initial investments, the majority of angels do
not stage their investments. The use of staging does not increase in response to higher degrees
of uncertainty or expected agency costs in the firm. Lastly, Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) report
venture capitalists employ many contractual clauses as protection. Unlike venture capitalists, I
find angels do not appear to use contractual design to safeguard their investment. Angels usually
take common equity claims, which do not afford them a higher degree of protection in the event of
bankruptcy or liquidation. The majority of contracts between firms and angels also do not contain
clauses for anti-dilution or contingent equity claims.
Angels may use alternative mechanisms of control. On average, less than a quarter of the
firm is sold to outsiders in each round. Potential moral hazard problems are mitigated because
the entrepreneur retains a large share of the equity. While their funding levels are not sensitive
to measures of investment uncertainty or expected agency costs, angels receive a higher level of
equity ownership to compensate for investing in earlier rounds. The average contribution per angel
decreases as the amount of uncertainty increases. Additionally, many investors syndicate risky
investments to share the risk and minimize the losses for any single investor. However, venture
capitalists also use syndication and incentive alignment in their investments, yet they maintain
strong traditional control rights as well.
An important facet of angel investing materializes by investigating the geographical proximity
of the investors. Geographic proximity is a substitute for many of the formal control mechanisms
and a compliment to other mechanisms such as syndication. Taken together, these results suggest
3

<-----Page 4----->that the entrepreneur appeals to sociological networks and uses local ties to generate initial funding
for the venture. The angels rely on trust in lieu of formal control. As the need for more capital
arises, the entrepreneur exhausts local funding sources. The entrepreneur must appeal to more professional and remote funders, such as venture capitalists, for assistance. Because the new funders
are not as familiar with the entrepreneur as the local investors, more formal control mechanisms
need to be implemented to protect their investment. This finding provides some insight into the
extensive control mechanisms used by institutional venture capital and the relative lack of formal
control with angels.
While much empirical and theoretical research has been conducted on venture capital, there
are few empirical studies of angel investing. Much of what is known is based on anecdotal evidence or small, regional surveys of angel investors (see Van Osnabrugge and Robinson(2000) for
an overview of survey results). These papers tend to focus mainly on descriptive statistics of investment size while my paper focuses on the control aspects of angel investment. Wetzel(1983)
provides one of the earliest profiles of angel investment in his survey of New England area angels.
Lerner(1998) analyzes the plausibility of public efforts to fund new firms via angels. Prowse(1998)
describes the characteristics of angel investors in the Dallas area. Ehrlich et al. (1994) publish survey results comparing the level of investor involvement of venture capitals and angels. Freear
and Wetzel (1990), Freear et al. (1992), and Sohl, Van Osnabrugge, and Robinson(2000) provide
survey evidence on the investment behavior of angels within certain industries.
The study that is most similar to this is Kaplan and Strömberg(2001), one of the first papers
to formally study the details of venture capital contracting. In their paper, Kaplan and Strömberg
provide detailed empirical evidence on the degree of board control, cash flow, liquidation and
voting rights in venture capital financings. They find that the control rights are held mostly by the
4

<-----Page 5----->venture capitalists, particularly when the performance of the firm is poor.
Casamatta(2000) develops a model that captures some of the differences between angel investment and venture capital. She finds the optimal choice of security is a function of the size of
investment. She finds that smaller investments (typically by angels) should use common equity
and straight preferred while larger investments (typically by venture capitalists) should use more
complicated securities. The empirical results from this paper support her predictions.
In additional to Kaplan and Strömberg(2001), a related line of literature examines investor
control in venture capital literature. Sahlman(1990) and Gompers and Lerner(1996) examine venture capital contracts and reports some typical stipulations in the contracts. Gompers(1995) finds
staged capital infusions to be more prevalent in situations of higher agency costs. Lerner(1995)
and Baker and Gompers(2000) investigate the degree of board control of venture capitalists in their
investments. Both papers find venture capitalists maintain active board participation.
Many theoretical papers examine the control aspects of venture capital. Berglöf(1994), Cornelli
and Yosha(2001), Repullo and Suarez(1999), and Hellmann(2001) investigate the role of convertible debt in venture financings. Admati and Pfleiderer(1994) and Garmaise(2000) investigate how
venture capital investors contract in asymmetric information environments. Hellmann(1998) looks
at how the allocation of control rights is affected by quality of replacement help. Kirilenko(2001)
argues that venture capitalists should get more control rights to compensate for information problems. Papers such as Hart and Moore(1994), Bergemann and Hege(1998), and Neher(1999) stress
the role of staging in their theoretical models.
My results are at odds with some theoretical findings, in large part because much of this research does not explicitly distinguish between angel investors and venture capital. As is the case
with much of the literature, it is possible the authors did not consider angel finance as a viable
5

<-----Page 6----->source of start-up capital since very little is known about angels. For example, Admati and Pfleiderer(1994) argue investors should hold a fixed fraction of equity through each investment stages.
However, my results show angels do not follow-on, meaning the the fraction of equity held by
angels decreases. Trester(1998) suggests investors should only use common equity in later stages;
I find common equity is most frequently used in the earliest stages of investment. Gompers(1997)
argues control rights should be assigned to investors in periods of highest asymmetric information, such as the early in the life of the project. I find that control rights are actually retained by
entrepreneurs even though investment occurs when the firms are young. My results also do not
support the results of Neher(1999), Bergemann and Hege(1998), and Cornelli and Yosha(2001)
who advocate the staging of capital and the optimality of convertible securities. The results of
many of these models rely on assumptions based on the stylized facts of venture capital investing
and did not consider angel investors as a financing alternative.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 is a brief background on angels and angel investments. Section 3 details the sample and the data collection process. A brief summary of the
model is described in section 4. The empirical tests and results are described section 5. Section 6
concludes. In the appendix, details of the model are provided.

2 Angel background
The term ’angel investor’ originates from funders for Broadway shows. Today, an angel investor
refers to a high-net worth individual who typically invests in small, private firms on their own
account. Formally, angel investors are ‘accredited investors’ according to the SEC. SEC Rule 501
of Regulation D states an accredited investor is an individual who has a net worth of more than $1

6

<-----Page 7----->million or an expected individual (household) yearly income of more than $200,000 ($300,000).
While the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances estimates that over 6 million household
qualify to be accredited investors, many studies estimate of the number of active angel investors in
the United States to be between 250,000 to 400,000.5
Sohl (1999) reports that angels are usually cashed-out entrepreneurs who continue to yearn
for the next high-growth venture. Because angels have to perform their own due diligence, they
typically invest in ventures in the familiar industries. Prowse (1998) reports that angels are diverse
in background, with some being financially sophisticated and others relatively inexperienced. In
addition to making a financial investment, some angels actively participate in the firm’s operations;
however, such participation varies by angel. He reports that angels usually invest close to home.
Using information collected from interviews with angels, Linde and Prasad(1999) finds the average
angel has a total of $335,000 invested in 4 different companies. As individual investors, angels
exhibit great heterogeneity in personal characteristics such as age, experience, and investment
preferences.

3 Sample Description
3.1 Data Gathering
To investigate the hypotheses of the model, I need a sample of angel-backed firms. The task is
complicated by the fact that no commercial database exists that systematically records angel transactions. The angel market involves private transactions which are not subject to public disclosure

7

<-----Page 8----->with very little institutional infrastructure supporting the market. Additionally, much of the market
is fragmented and unorganized. These factors make data difficult to obtain.
To conduct this study, I collect data through surveys and interviews with entrepreneurial firms.
Over 800 angel-backed firms were identified via newswires, periodicals (such as Angel Investor,
press releases, angel networks, and websites (such as Red Herring’s Herringtown and Localbusiness.com). Firms were asked if they had received any outside funding. Angel backed firms were
contacted for information regarding all financing received since firm initiation. In addition to financial information, the firms were asked to provide descriptive information on their firm such as
the number of employees, revenues (if any), and background information on the founders. Due
to issues of confidentiality and competition, some respondents only provided partial responses.
Whenever possible, a founder or person responsible for investor relations was contacted for information. The final sample consists of 215 investment rounds made by angel investors in 143
companies from 1994 to 2001.
All funding rounds consisted of some financial participation by angels, whether it was angels
only or co-investing with venture capitalists, strategic investors, or other investors such as friends
and family. For my purposes, any funding conducted by ’angel venture’ funds or limited-liability
organizations acting as ’early-stage-angel’ funds are considered venture capital funds because I
only wanted investments by individuals. For example, entities such as Angel Investors LLP and
the Band of Angels Fund are considered a venture fund. However, investments from individual
Band of Angels members are classified as angel investments.
The sample of firms has many advantages. Since entrepreneurial firms were asked for information (instead of angels), the sample is free from the bias caused by investors only reporting
information from only the successful ventures. Although surveys are imperfect for the usual rea8

<-----Page 9----->sons, the approach allowed for subjective answers from entrepreneurs on questions such as the
quality of help from outside investors. While it is impossible to obtain information on every completed angel financing due to the very nature of the transactions, every effort has been made to
make the sample as unbiased and representative as possible. The 215 financings are a large enough
sample to draw representative conclusions.

3.2 Sample Selection Issues
In this section, I discuss potential selection issues concerning my sample. The financings are not a
completely random sample in that the data is from firms that were willing to respond to inquiries
and provide confidential information.
I contacted 801 companies for information and received information from 143 companies.
Of the 143 companies in the sample, 56 companies are identified via newswires, 48 companies
from Red Herring’s Herringtown website,6 33 from angels or angel networks and 6 from other
miscellaneous sources.7 It is possible that the companies surveyed were more successful, having
released some information publicly. However, many of the companies surveyed have since been
acquired, ceased operations, or continued to operate successfully. As of November 2001, 102 of
the companies are still operating, 9 have been acquired, 22 have ceased operations. No companies
have gone public in the time. I am not able to verify the status of 10 companies.
The average age of the companies when surveyed is 24.5 months (with a median of 19 months),
relatively close to the age of the companies at funding in table 1. The proximity between the survey
age and the funding age should reduce selection bias problems.

include companies personally referred by angels.

9

<-----Page 10----->Despite the possibilities of modest selection bias existing in the sample, the biases should not
be of great concern since I am not attempting to measure performance. Instead, I am trying to
detail the specifics of angel investments and the role of angel investors. In this respect, the sample
is likely to be similar to typical angel investments.

3.3 Summary Statistics
Table 1 presents summary information for the sample. Panel A of table 1 reports the geographical
distribution of the dataset.8 In comparison to venture capital investments, the dataset has fewer
observations in California and New England, although the sample remains heavily weighted toward California. For the time period of 1995-2000, Venture Economics reports slightly more than
22% of venture-capital-backed companies are located in California. A major difference between
Venture Economics and my data is the high representation of firms in the southeast and an underrepresentation of firms from New England. Venture Economics reports between 12% of venture
backed companies are located in New England whereas less than six percent of my sample comes
from New England. If angel activity is concentrated in the highest areas of venture capital activity,
then the sample has minor geographical differences. However, the data geographic breakdown
falls roughly in line with AngelSociety’s Survey of angel group activity.9
Panel B shows the date of company formation. Most of the companies are founded between
1998 and 2000. While it is easy to state the founding date of the company as the date of legal
incorporation, many firms had other significant events occur, such as the hiring an employee or
the beginning of business operations, before legal incorporation. I take the founding date as the

<-----Page 11----->earliest date that I have for any significant firm activity. Most of the angel rounds were completed
in 1998-2000, with over half of my sample financing rounds from 2000. While the young age
of the companies does not allow for long term panel studies, the relative youth of our companies
and the freshness of the funding is positive for many aspects. First, the findings in this paper will
not suffer from survivorship bias caused by analyzing data from older companies. Secondly, the
companies reflect the current state and trends in angel financing.
Panel C divides the sample into different industries as defined by Venture Economics. Most
of the sample are from the ’Computer Related’ industry, reflecting the technology boom in the
late 1990s. ’Computer Related’ firms include are internet services, internet content and design
firms, and business-to-business/consumer companies. This may be oversampling of one industry,
or it may represent the trend in the late 1990s to invest heavily in computer related companies, an
industry which experienced rapid growth during this time. Data from venture capital disbursements
seem to support this idea. Gompers and Lerner(2001) find 60% of all venture capital disbursements
went to information technology industries.
As Panel D indicates, the majority of the rounds in my sample are pre-revenue. 69% (99 of 143
companies) of the firms are pre-revenue for all funding rounds. This is significantly different than
the sample of firms in most venture capital research. For example, less than 40% of the firms in
Kaplan and Strömberg’s (2001) sample are pre-revenue firms. If revenue generation is an indicator
of development, my analysis focuses on firms who are earlier in their life-cycle than analysis on
venture capital financed firms. Panel E indicates the age of the firms in the sample at first funding.
The average age of first funding is 10.5 months. Most firms that receive funding are less than 12
months old. In comparison, the average age at first funding for venture-backed firms is greater than
one year (Gompers (1995)). If information quality is linked to age, then the uncertainty should be
11

<-----Page 12----->much greater in angel-financed than in venture capital financed firms. Panel D and E of table 1
support the idea that angels typically finance earlier stage companies.
Panel A of Table 2 shows that most of my sample (157 rounds) is financed entirely by angels.
Co-investment by angels and venture capitalists accounts for less than twenty percent of all funding
rounds. This indicates that angels are a different type of venture investor, not merely co-investors
with institutional venture capital.
Panel B of Table 2 describes the funding amounts for the financing rounds. The median investment per investment round is $1 million. Not surprisingly, firms with positive revenue or are
in later stages of financing receive greater amounts financing, suggesting as asymmetric information decreases in later rounds or with observable revenue streams, financing increases. In rounds
having only angel participation, the mean investment is 1.28M (median of 850,000). Compared
to the results in Kaplan and Strömberg(2001), the average amount of financing provided by venture capitalists is twice the size of amount of financing provided by angels only for companies at
comparable stages.
Comparing the results from table 2 with data from institutional venture capital data from Venture Economics yields many differences between angels and venture capital. In rounds closed
between 1998 and 2000, the average round of venture capital investment is 17.95M per round.
Considering only venture capital funded seed and start-up rounds, the size of average venture capital investment remains larger than angel contributions. From 1998 to 2000, an average of 4.77M
was received from venture capitalists by companies in these startup/seed stages. The average angel
funding is 2.17M across all rounds. Panel D and E of table 2 reports angel financing is smaller
than venture capital fundings in comparable industries.
The difference in funding size provides some evidence that angels play a complementary role
12

<-----Page 13----->to venture capital. Instead of competing with venture capitalists for firms at similar stages of
development, angels provide a smaller amount of funding to younger firms.

4 Model Implications
The model in the appendix predicts entrepreneurs will retain control rights in their investments
even with the ability to renegotiate contracts. However, certain investments may not be feasible if
the entrepreneur does not relinquish control to the outside investor. In particular, if a project requires a large investment, the only way that the investor will fund a project is if he receives control.
Additionally, control rights shift to the outside investor as the value of liquidation increases. Moreover, if the entrepreneur retains controls rights (as is the case with smaller investments), straight
equity will be the preferred security. Larger investments which require the ceding of control rights
will use a more complicated security similar to convertible debt.
Within the context of angel investors, the model predicts that smaller investments will use
straight equity. As long as the outside investors only own a small fraction of the firm, the entrepreneur will retain the control rights. As the ownership of the angels increase, more control will
be ceded.
The model has predictions regarding the variation in contracts between angel and venture capital investments. As the information in the summary statistics indicate, angel investors typically
provide small amounts of capital,10 typically with less than 20% of the equity exchanged for investment, while venture capitalists typically provide larger amounts of capital for larger ownership
shares.11 According to the model, venture capitalists should receive more control provisions in
10 See
11 See

table 1
Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) for details on venture capital ownership levels.

13

<-----Page 14----->their deals. Additionally, venture capitalists often have a better ability to liquidate the firm because
of their larger network of contacts compared to angel investors. Because of this, control rights are
more likely to be held by venture capitalists rather than angels. Lastly, the model predicts a more
complicated security with larger investment; therefore, venture capitalists should use a convertible
claim, while angels should use an equity-like claim.

5 Empirical Tests and Results
In this section, I use my sample to provide detailed evidence on the predictions of the model. Inferences regarding the differences in the allocation of control rights between venture capital and
angel investors are drawn by comparing existing results on venture capital to my findings. Subsequently, I investigate the variation of the distribution of control rights within angel investments. In
addition to the model’s predictions, I test for other determinants that may determine distribution of
control rights. These factors are culled from existing literature on venture capital. In addition to
funding, venture capitalists often provide professionalization assistance. I examine whether angels
can provide the same non-monetary benefits to the new enterprise.

5.1 Control Rights
Many investors seek to protect their investment from expropriation through the use of control
rights. I consider three common controls mechanisms used by institutional venture capital. The
first measure is representation on the board of directors. Receiving board rights is an indication that
investors maintain a degree of authority over the manager. Secondly, the control of investments
through staging has been documented in the venture capital literature (see Gompers(1995)) as a
14

<-----Page 15----->control mechanism. Staging an investment can effectively halt the progress of a wayward venture
as capital is no longer available for the new firm. Lastly, as Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) demonstrate in venture capital contracts, contracting mechanisms such as security choice and contractual
provisions can be effective methods of control. If angels are identical to venture capitalists, they
should maintain similar protections, particularly in ventures where the threat of expropriation is
the highest.
Many theories emphasize the role that capital providers such as venture capital provide after the investment is made. Lerner(1995) finds venture capitalists exercise control through board
representation and the active recruitment and dismissal CEOs. Kaplan and Strömberg(2000) find
many venture capitalists anticipate having an active role in management and the hiring of new
management. If angel investors are similar to venture capital organizations, angels should actively
participate in the lives of the firms.

5.1.1

Board Rights

Board seats give outside investors the ability to affect corporate decisions. Board rights are particularly important in environments with greater uncertainty since it is not feasible to specify all
possible contingencies in the ex ante contract. Sahlman(1990) finds board seats are typically allocated to venture capitalists as part of a financing rounds. Panel A of table 3 shows this is not the
case with angel investments. Board seats are granted only in 42.5% of all funding rounds. The
likelihood of providing a board seat does not change much when considering pre- and post-revenue
funding rounds. The initial round of angel financing tends to have a slightly higher (though not
statistically significant) probability of board seat allocation, although fewer than half of all first
rounds relinquish board seats to outside investors.
15

<-----Page 16----->Lerner(1995) reports an average of 1.12 board seats are added in each venture capital round.
In panel C of table 3, an average of only 0.59 board seats are added to the board of directors in a
typical angel financed investment round. The board size in the angel-financed ventures are much
smaller than public companies12 or venture-backed firms.13 Panel C shows that the average board
size of the firms is 3.71 members with a median of 4 members. Panel D reports, on average,
angels only represent 18% of the board of directors. Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) find venture
capitalists control between 37 to 47 % of the board seats in the firms they invest in. In my sample,
insiders have the majority of board seats on 100 boards (out of 116 where I have information on
board composition subsequent to funding) which is consistent with Kaplan and Strömberg’s (2001)
finding that outside board control is less common for early-stage companies. However, in venture
capital funded firms, insiders comprise the majority in only 13.9% of the boards. From table 3,
angels take a much smaller degree of control through board representation than venture capitalists.
The results on boards of directors are consistent with other theories which suggest a passive role
for angels. Fama and Jensen(1983) hypothesize that the composition of board should be shaped
by the need for monitoring. If the threat of managerial expropriation is high, then the board will
bear a greater responsibility for oversight. Additionally, at the early age of the firm, much of the
value of venture is embodied in the human capital of the entrepreneurs, so the replacement of the
founders would not seem to increase the value of the company.
Similarly, the need for a board seat may be determined by the need for oversight within each
company. Larger investments (and equity stakes) by outsiders will increase the need for oversight.
Ventures with larger potential agency costs should be monitored more often. Firms in industries

13 See

16

<-----Page 17----->with higher market-to-book ratios may need more monitoring as agency costs are often associated
with growth options. Tangible assets lower expected the agency costs in inefficient continuation,
decreasing the need for board seats. Industry volatility should increase the need for a board seat
if the volatility is a measure of the uncertainty in the project. Firms with intensive R&D may
need more oversight since it is likely that these firms will have more specific assets that can be
expropriated. Entrepreneurs with previous entrepreneurial history may not need as much oversight
because their reputations have already been established. Finally, early rounds, when uncertainty is
the highest, should have more board seats allocated.
Table 4 reports results from the probit regressions on the factors determining the allocation
of board seats. Panel A examines the results for all funding rounds and panel B only considers
funding rounds composed entirely of angel funders. The coefficient on industry volatility has the
opposite sign as predicted and different from Kaplan and Strömberg’s (2001) finding that outsider
board control is positively related to industry volatility. Though the coefficients on R&D are economically large, they are not always statistically significant. However, the coefficient on the ratio
of fixed assets has the opposite sign from expectation. In total, the regression provides mixed results on the predictions of the models and other theories. It appears that angels do not increase
the use of board representation as a control mechanism in projects with higher agency costs or
uncertainty.

5.1.2

Staging

Empirical and theoretical works have emphasized the importance of staging as a control mechanism for venture capitalists. Instead of providing all the needed capital in a lump sum, the investment is provided in stages, preserving the investor’s option to abandon. Models such as Hart and
17

<-----Page 18----->Moore(1994), Bergemann and Hege(1998), and Neher(1999) stress the importance of staging as
a control mechanism. Gompers(1995) finds that venture capitalists use staging as an important
method to control agency costs.
Panel A of table 5 provides mixed results for the use of staging. Consecutive rounds funded
by angels only do tend to have follow on investors. However, if the subsequent financing round
involves venture capital participation, angels do not follow on. This finding supports the complementary nature of angel and venture capital investment. Once the firm has been nurtured to
success, with success being venture capital investment, the angels step aside to more professional
investors.14 Panel B shows that even when angels follow on, only an average of 40% of investors
from previous rounds participate in the subsequent rounds.
I investigate the factors that affect the probability of staging investment in the probit regressions in panels C and D of table 5. Similar to the predictions on board seats, investors in ventures
with high degrees of agency costs and uncertainty should have a higher probability of staging their
investments. The predictions for the coefficients of the independent variables are similar to the
predictions for board rights. However, the results indicate that many of the variables do not significantly affect whether angels stage investment. Most of the variables are not statistically significant.
Investigating only angel financed rounds, none of the independent variables are statistically significant although the coefficient on research and development is economically large. Angels may
want to wait for the product to be closer to development before committing additional funds. In
summary, staging is not a frequently used control mechanism by angels. Staging does not appear
to be used to control agency costs or relieve uncertainty in investment decisions.
14 Alternatively, venture capitalists may not want to co-invest with angels, thereby forcing angels aside. Evidence
for this idea is provided in panel C of table 11. The number of angels is significantly lower in rounds with venture
capital co-investment.

Contractual Provisions

Angel investors may use contractual provisions as protection from expropriation. More complex securities may provide investors stronger protections in the event of liquidation. Contractual
clauses may give the investor additional protection from expropriation. Common protections in
venture contracts include ratcheting and anti-dilution agreements.
Panel A of table 6 reports the types of security used in each round. Common equity is the
most prevalent security, used in 34% of all rounds and 39.5% of angel-only rounds. In contrast,
Sahlman(1990), Gompers(1998) and Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) report that convertible preferred
is the dominant security in venture capital financing. The high usage of preferred and common
equity is consistent with the theoretical predictions of Casamatta (2000). In her model, Casamatta
finds common equity is better suited to smaller investments (such as those made by angels) while
larger investments should use preferred or convertible preferred securities. Equity may be used
more often with angel investments because of the higher costs of writing a complex securities with
a small investment outweigh the benefits.
Panels B and C of table 6 reports regression results from probit regressions where the dependent
variable is equal to one if the security used is equity and 0 otherwise. Smaller investments may not
justify the use of complex securities because of the higher costs of implementing a more complex
security. Complex securities should be used the threat of expropriation is greater. Thus, a negative
coefficient is expected for the market-to-book ratio, R & D and industry volatility. Firms that have
an identifiable revenue stream and entrepreneur with prior entrepreneurial experience may not need
as strong a security than other firms.
The results in table 6 support the relation between funding and security choice. Large invest-

19

<-----Page 20----->ment rounds use more complex securities, providing some support for the model. However, if the
size of the investment is measured by equity stake, the coefficient is not statistically significant,
lending support to the fixed costs of security choice. The other independent variables do not affect the choice of security, indicating that the cross sectional variation in security choice is not
influenced by concerns with reducing agency costs or expropriation.
In addition to security choice, many investment contracts have provisions that protect and empower the investor. Panel D contains information on many of these contractual clauses. Many
contracts contain a follow-on right of first refusal provision that allows angels to participate in future rounds to capture the potential upside in successful ventures. However, as table 5 shows, many
angels do not exercise this right. 26% of financing rounds contain weighted ratchet closes for protection against future rounds at decreased valuations. Full ratcheting protection was not given in
any investment round. In comparison, Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) find 21.9% of their sample use
full-ratcheting and 78.1% of their sample use weighted-ratcheting. Kaplan and Strömberg(2001)
find contingent equity ownership prevalent in venture capital contracts. However, very few angel
contracts contain provisions for contingent equity stakes.
Contractual protection from expropriation is not one-sided. Panel E indicates 38 financing
rounds contain provisions that allow the firm to repurchase the stake of the angel, similar to the
call provisions explained in Sahlman(1990). Many entrepreneurs cite this clause as a way to rid
themselves of ’bad apples’ or investors whose vision does not coincide with that of the founders.

20

<-----Page 21----->5.2 Alternative Mechanisms
In contrast to previous results on the control mechanisms adopted by venture capitalists, I find angels do not implement the same methods of managerial oversight. In particular, angels typically do
not receive board seats, stage investments, or use particularly strong contractual claims to protect
their claims. The use of the conventional control mechanisms is not very sensitive to commonly
used measures of agency costs and uncertainty. Little support is found that increases in potential
agency costs and uncertainty lead to increased use of protections. The puzzle remains: how do
angel investors mitigate the increased risks of investing at early stages?

5.2.1

Funding

This section investigates the factors affecting the amount of funding. If investors are concerned
with large degrees of uncertainty, then the average contribution per investor, total funding amounts,
and number of investors will be sensitive to industry proxies for uncertainty, characteristics of the
entrepreneur and management team, and the presence of a revenue stream. Intangibles factors such
as entrepreneur’s prior experience may provide signals to alleviate investor uncertainty. Funders
may feel more secure investing with entrepreneurs who have a previous track record. More mature
firms and larger firms also should have more existing information, decreasing the uncertainty with
investment. Having a management team or a revenue stream signals to investors that the firm has
completed the initial research and development phases. Hellmann and Puri(2000) find the hiring of
a marketing and sales vice president to be an indicator for product development. Another method
to protect against large potential losses it to invest smaller amounts in greater uncertainty and to
syndicate riskier investments. Lerner(1994) finds venture capitalists syndicate early rounds as a

21

<-----Page 22----->method to verify their decision making processes.
Table 7 provides evidence on the factors influence the amount of funding in a round. The
results on the total funds raised in the round are displayed in panel A, and the funds in angel-only
investment rounds are shown panel B. Focusing on the angels-only results in panel B, post-revenue
firms actually receive less funding. High growth firms, as measured by the industry market-tobook ratio, receive more funding in each round. However, there is little support that any other
measures of uncertainty strongly influence the amount of funding as most of the coefficients are
not statistically significant.
As evidenced by the statistics on cash flow rights in table 8, the majority of residual claims
belong to management. Outside investors typically own less than a quarter of the new firm. Angels
may not need a high degree of control because the threat of expropriation is minimized by the large
residual claim held by the founders. The incentives of the founders are aligned with the prospects
of the firm. In comparison, Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) find venture capitalists hold a slightly
larger proportion of cash flow rights (on average 40%) in the investments that they make. Because
the incentives of the entrepreneur are not as strongly aligned with the outside investors, the need
for formal control may be greater. However, it is questionable whether such a small decrease in
managerial ownership drastically increases the need for formal controls.
Table 9 presents estimates from two stage least squares regressions where the dependent variable is the equity ownership allocated to the outside investors in each round. Angels receive a
higher equity stake to compensate for the extra risk of investing under greater uncertainty. The
statistically significant and positive coefficient on the first round dummy indicates angels receive
a premium for investing early. Having a management team in place, an indication that the firm
has progressed passed the initial development stages, decreases the equity ownership purchased
22

<-----Page 23----->by outsiders. Investors in firms with more uncertainty, as measured by industry volatility, receive
more cash flow rights. Greater research and development intensity leads to a decreased equity
stake for angels. These results agree with the results from Kaplan and Strömberg(2001).

5.2.2

Syndication

Another method of reducing risk is to syndicate investment with other investors. By syndicating investments, the investors may be able to share the risks and share in the monitoring of the
firm. Additionally, more angels investing may signify that firm has passed the evaluations of more
screeners. Syndication may act as a verification mechanism, thus it is expected that earlier funding
rounds will have more investors.
Table 10 shows the average number of angels participating in each round. On average, twelve
angels co-invest in a round. In comparison, Kaplan and Strömberg(2001) find venture rounds
are normally syndicated with two to nine funds co-investing. While the increase in syndication
may increase the monitoring capacities of the angel investment group,15 venture capitalists also
syndicate their investments while maintaining more formal control mechanisms.
Panel A of table 10 shows that the number of angels in each round is higher in earlier rounds.
As firms develop, later rounds and post-revenue firms receive larger average contributions per
angel. On average each angel owns between three to five percent of the firm.
I run regressions to further examine the factors that influence the variation of contribution
amounts. Panels A and B of table 11 shows the average contribution per angel is only affected by
early rounds, although the coefficient is not statistically significant in panel B. In panel B, angels
have a higher average contribution when a management team is in place at the firm.
15 The

increased syndication may lead to free-rider problems as well

23

<-----Page 24----->Panel C and D of table 11 provides results on the factors that determine the number of angels
investing in a round. The model is an instrumental variables estimate of a poisson model, following
the 2SQML method detailed in Mullahy(1997). Using this procedure, the estimates are consistent,
but the standard errors may be positively biased using this procedure. The results in panel D for
angels-only rounds indicate more investors in firms in higher market-to-book industries, suggesting
that more investors want to invest in ventures with the higher growth. Entrepreneurial experience
seems to attract more investors.

5.3 Geographic Proximity
The results on geographical proximity deserve further elaboration and may provide insight into
the investing behavior of angels. Entrepreneurs may begin their search for capital by exploring
local resources. A localized bond of trust may exist between the entrepreneur and investor, making
formal control mechanisms unnecessary. Because of the strong trust and familiarity many local
investors may have with each other, syndication is greater among local investors. Subsequent
larger fundings may exhaust the resources of the local investors and need to be funded by more
professional investors. Additionally, as a firm progresses, the need to professionalization services
is greater, leading the entrepreneur to turn to more professional investors who require more formal
control because of their lack of familiarity with the founders.
If investment size is related to the degree of uncertainty and the cost of information dissemination is related to geography, the amount of investment should increase as the angels are closer.
Alternatively, investments made by investors at a distance can be most costly (either to monitor,
to negotiate, etc.). The results in table 7 show the total funding and the angels’ contribution to the

24

<-----Page 25----->round decrease when the nearest angel is less than fifty miles away, supporting the second idea.
Panel B of table 11 shows the average contribution per angel also decreases as the angels
are closer, suggesting that local investors may not be as wealthy as more professional investors.
However, this is offset by the increase in the number of angels who invest if they are located
closer to the entrepreneur. Lastly, from table 12 local investors provide more help given their local
proximity. However, geographical proximity may delay venture capital investment. A possible
explanation is local angels do not have as large as a contact network as more professional investors.
Some additional validation for this idea is provided by examining the results on the formal
control mechanisms: board seats, staging and security choice. In contrast to Lerner’s (1995) finding that close geographical proximity increases the likelihood of board representation, I find geographical proximity has a negative effect on the probability of board representation in angel funded
rounds (table 4), albeit the results not highly significant. The need for contractual monitoring (via
a board seat) may be reduced because of the geographic proximity of investors. Although not statistically significant, geographic proximity also decreases the use of staging and increases the use
of equity, consistent with the localized investor hypothesis.
Taken together, these results suggest many entrepreneurs begin their search for capital with
local resources, relying on local ties to encourage investment. Local angel investors may not be as
sophisticated as more professional investors, but may be more trusting.

5.4 Other Post-Investment Activities
In this section, I consider the role angels have in the success of the firm. Gorman and Sahlman(1989),
Sahlman(1990), and Ehrlich et al. find that venture capitalist actively participate in their invest-

25

<-----Page 26----->ments after funding. In addition to funding, angel investors may play an active role in professionalizing the firm or bringing a product to market, similar to some activities that venture capitalists
provide (Hellmann and Puri(2001)). Since many angels are former entrepreneurs or industry executives, many angels may derive some private benefits from assisting in the development of a new
firm.
Building the management team is an important responsibility of the founders. In table 7, a
complete management team leads to larger funding amounts. Hellmann and Puri(2001) find that
venture capitalists help form the management team. In panel A of table 12, 23.5% of respondents
said that angel investors assisted in identifying and recruiting members of the management team.
Kaplan and Strömberg(2000) find that 50% of venture capitalists expect to replace the CEO or
help recruit the management team. I find that angels tend to provide less assistance than venture
capitalist in recruiting top management.
Angels can provide assistance in another important area, helping to locate and secure subsequent financing from venture capital. Gorman and Sahlman(1989) report venture capitalists
consider raising additional funds the most important activity. If angels are helpful in securing additional funding from venture capital, the time until venture funding should decrease as the number
of angels increases because of a larger network of contacts. Panel B of table 12 presents hazard
rate duration regressions on the time until venture capital financing assuming that the hazard rate
follows the Weibull distribution. There are 57 financing rounds where the subsequent round is
financed by venture capital. I find that more angel investors leads to a faster time to venture financing. This is evidence that angels can play a networking role; a larger number of angels leads to a
larger network of contacts and faster venture capital financing.
Panel C of table 12 presents results from ordered logit regressions where the dependent variable
26

<-----Page 27----->is the amount of help that angel investors provided the firm. The amount of help is a subjective
response from the founders, so it is tainted by the usual problems with subjective responses. The
variable is separated into 5 categories with the lowest category representing ’little or no help’
and the highest category corresponding to ’a lot of beneficial help from angel investors.’ In all
the regressions, geography is statistically significant at the 5% level. Angels who are in closer
proximity tend to provide better assistance. Familiarity with issues confronting new ventures may
require more interaction, therefore geographical proximity may encourage more assistance. Other
variables do not appear to affect the degree of assistance.

6 Conclusion
This paper presents an examination of angel investing. Using a hand-collected dataset, I detail the
characteristics of angel finance, from the implemented control mechanisms to the determinants of
funding levels. I find that angels are not given the traditional control rights that venture capitalists
typically use. Rather, one of the primary mechanisms to control agency costs is the alignment of the
entrepreneur’s interests with those of the firm through the large ownership positions. Additionally,
angels make smaller investments and increase syndication when investing in the riskier ventures.
The results suggest a difference between venture capital investors and angel investors. The
summary statistics show angels fund smaller amounts than venture capital. Firms that require larger
amounts will seek venture capital investment, while angels may be preferred for small capital.
Closer examination reveals that venture capitals may not like to co-invest with angels. Angel
investors appear to nurture younger firms until the company is established enough for venture
capital consideration.

27

<-----Page 28----->A puzzle still remains as to why angels provide capital in highly uncertain operations without much formal protection from expropriation. I suggest a geographic based explanation. Geographical proximity plays a large role in determining the funding amount, control, and degree
of post-investment assistance from angels. These results are similar to the networking effects for
venture capital found by Sorenson and Stuart(forthcoming). Sorenson and Stuart find close geographic proximity increases the likelihood of funding and the ease of monitoring. Additionally,
some support is found that investors may receive private benefits from investing. O
ther theories cannot be excluded. It is entirely possible that the returns from investing at early
stages may be commensurate to the risk involved. Table 9 shows first round investments receive a
significantly higher equity claim, enhancing the possible return for early investors. To address this
hypothesis, reliable estimates on private equity returns need to be obtained. As Cochrane(2001)
shows, private equity returns are problematic to measure.
Another explanation may be that angels have specialized information and have a high ability to
screen for higher quality projects. Many investors have made their fortunes in the same industries
that they subsequently invest in. Industry knowledge is difficult to measure and examine since the
identities of the investors need to be known. In such a confidential environment, the screening
ability of angels would be difficult to examine.
Lastly, issues of liquidity and exit strategy are not addressed. Since the investor seeks to make
a high return from his investment, the time to and method of exit may affect the funding and
contractual status between parties. These issues are left for future work.

e Not exerting effort results in an expected payoff of θM.

making the final payoff θM.
The entrepreneur has the exclusive rights (monopoly rights or specific human capital) to develop this project, but is wealth constrained, and needs to raise funds from outside resources. The
entrepreneur is risk-neutral; her utility is only affected by her final wealth. Risk-neutral financiers
have funds to finance the project. In exchange for the the investment, the financier receives a share
of the project’s outcome, α.

Assumption 1 Equity is the only security in this economy.

The financier and entrepreneur share the same beliefs regarding the probabilities, payoffs, and
cost of effort in this economy. There are three dates in the model. At the initial date 0, the
entrepreneur negotiates with outside investors and the investment is made if the contracting is
successful. At date 1, a liquidation opportunity, L is available. The party that holds the control
rights makes the liquidation decision. At date 2, the project is revealed a success or failure and the
payoffs are distributed to the contracting parties. All payoffs are in date 0 present values.
In addition to the payoffs from the project, the entrepreneur enjoys private benefits from managing the project. The private benefits accumulate to the entrepreneur only if the project is not liquidated. Private benefits may be on-the-job consumption, recognition for leading an entrepreneurial

29

<-----Page 30----->venture or any other similar benefit. B denotes the monetary equivalent of the entrepreneur’s private benefits.
The contract agreed upon at date zero specifies the allocation of control rights, γ, the share of
the liquidation value, β, and the share of the final payoff, given to the investors in exchange for the
required investment I. Let αγ denote the share retained by the entrepreneur and 1 − αγ equal the
share given to the outside financier. If the project is liquidated, the entrepreneur will receive βL
and the financier will receive (1 − β)L. The contract cannot be made contingent on the effort of
the entrepreneur. Denote entrepreneurial control of liquidation by γ = 0, and outsider control by
γ = 1.
In the first best scenario, effort is provided by the entrepreneur if

(A-1)

If the entrepreneur must go to the outside financier for capital, she must decide the share to
offer and whether or not to allocate the control rights to the outsiders. In this section, the initial
contract agreed upon at date zero cannot be renegotiated at intermediate dates. Later sections will
investigate the ramifications of renegotiation.
Consider the regime where γ = 0. With control rights, the entrepreneur will not liquidate the
firm if the private benefits are large enough. The entrepreneur will exert effort if

Assumption 2 M
With this assumption, effort is more likely to be provided if β = 0.
Lemma 1 If β = 0, the entrepreneur is more likely to exert effort.
Proof.
Consider the IC constraint of the entrepreneur. If the IC constraint is more likely to hold if
β = 0, then the lemma is true.
Equation A-5 can be rewritten as:

e − βL) − Pr(C|NE)(α1 θM
e − βL) − k
Pr(C|E)(α1 θM
e has a convex cdf, the expression is decreasing in beta.
Since Pr(C|E) ≥ Pr(C|NE) and M
Hence, the expression is maximized with β = 0.
β may be considered the bargaining power of the investor in liquidation. The lemma shows
that effort is provided more often if the investor retains all the payoff in liquidation, making the
entrepreneur work harder to avoid liquidation. From a security design standpoint, the claim that
the investor holds is no longer a straight equity claim, but it resembles a convertible security that
is fixed in low states and converted to equity in high states.

If γ = 1 and L > I, the investor recoups extra

Consider the difference in the entrepreneur’s utility between the control regimes:

(A-8)

The proof is analogous if the entrepreneur decides to expend no effort. Clearly, if the entrepreneur expends effort with γ = 1, then she will also expend effort with γ = 0. If expending effort
with γ = 0 is rational, this will dominate any choice with γ = 1.
Without renegotiation of the contract, the entrepreneur is better off by retaining the control
rights. If γ = 0, the entrepreneur will work more often, but many projects are not feasible if γ = 0.
If the project requires a large investment, retaining control may require that α ≥ 1. The set of
feasible projects with γ = 1 is larger (although not as large as the first best) since the outside
33

<-----Page 34----->investor does not require as large of a share. In the next section, I outline the characteristics of
project feasibility.

A.1

Project Feasibility

More projects will be contracted under the first best optimum than if the entrepreneur is forced to
seek outside investment. If effort is required for the project to be successful, many projects are
not completed because the required effort is not provided as the entrepreneur bears the cost of this
effort while receiving only part of the gains.
If γ = 0, the feasibility of the project depends on the NPV. Denote

NPVeffort =

e −I
θM

(A-9a)

NPVno effort =

e −I
θM

(A-9b)

If NPVno effort ≥ 0 then any project that is funded in the first best will also be funded. If
NPVeffort > 0 then the project will be funded only if equation A-2 is satisfied. However, consider a
project where
NPVeffort ≥ 0 > NPVno effort
but equation A-2 is not satisfied. These projects will not be funded, despite being positive net
present value.
From proposition 1, the entrepreneur will prefer to retain control rights whenever it is feasible. However, some projects are only feasible by ceding the control rights to the outside investor.
Projects that require more capital are more likely to be feasible with outside control because the in-

34

<-----Page 35----->vestor benefits from the downside protection of liquidation. In these situations, α0 < 0 but α1 > 0.
Another situation where project feasibility matters involves the costs of effort. Consider a
project where equation A-2 is violated:


α0 θ − θ < k

but NPVno effort < 0. With entrepreneurial control, this project is not feasible. However if L > I,
the project is able to be financed if

α1
θ−θ
>
α0 P(C|E)θ − P(C|NE)θ

The ratio

α1
α0

(A-10)

is affected by the liquidation value. Larger values of liquidation and lower prob-

abilities of continuation, P(C|E), increase the ratio

α1
α0 ,

enhancing the likelihood of equation A-10

being satisfied. There is a tradeoff with the increase in effort provision when control rights are
retained and the decrease in effort because a larger share needs to be given to the outside investors.

A.2

With Renegotiation

If the entrepreneur and investor can renegotiate the contract when the liquidation opportunity arises
at at date 1, the contractual decision may change. Renegotiation will eliminate some situations of
inefficient continuation or liquidation.
e + B < L (or θM
e + B < L if effort is not provided)
If γ = 0, renegotiation will only occur if θM
since β = 0 and the entrepreneur does not receive any payoff in liquidation. The case where
the liquidation value is greater than the total value of the project is uninteresting and will not be

35

<-----Page 36----->considered here. If γ = 0, the payoffs will be the same as above.
e > L > (1 − α1 )θM.
e
Renegotiation with γ = 1 is more interesting. Renegotiation occurs if θM
While it is efficient to continue the project, the investor, who has the control rights, would like to
liquidate the project and obtain the higher payoff, L. To avoid liquidation, the entrepreneur must
bribe the investor to continue. Without loss of generality, I assume a take-it-or-leave it bargaining
game where the outside investor has all the bargaining power, allowing him to usurp all the surplus.
Therefore, in the bargaining state, the investor actually has a higher payoff.
With renegotiation, the entrepreneur’s utility with effort is:

e ≥ L)(α1 θM
e + B) + Pr(θM
e > L > (1 − α1 )θM)B
e −k
Pr((1 − α1 )θM

(A-11)

e ≥ L) and Pr(B|E) = Pr(θM
e > L > (1 − α1 )θM).
e Pr(C|NE) and
Let Pr(C|E) = Pr((1 − α)θM
Pr(B|NE) are defined similarly. The entrepreneur will exert effort if

α1 M(Pr(C|E)θ − Pr(C|NE)θ) + B(Pr(B|E) − Pr(B|NE)) ≥ k
If γ = 1 the entrepreneur will be more likely to exert effort because of the potential gain in the
e is convex.
bargaining state, B(Pr(B|E) − Pr(B|NE)) since the cdf of M
Proposition 2 With bargaining, the entrepreneur still prefers to retain control if γ = 0 is feasible.

36

<-----Page 37----->Proof. Consider the entrepreneur’s utility under the two regimes, γ = 0 and γ = 1

Uγ=0 −Uγ=1 =

(A-12)

e 0 − P(C|E)α1 ) + (1 − P(C|E) − P(B|E))B
= θM(α
e − I − ((θM(P(C|E)
e

+ P(B|E)) − I + (1 − P(B|E) − P(C|E))L + P(B|E)B)
e − L) > 0
≥ (1 − P(B|E) − P(C|E))(θM
(A-13)

Although the entrepreneur prefers to retain control, many projects may not be feasible with
γ = 0. With renegotiation, the same problems with project feasibility under the γ = 0 regime
still exist. However, renegotiation allows for greater efficiency as more projects are funded with
renegotiation.

<-----Page 47----->Table 4: Determinants of Board Seats
This table presents two stage instrumented probit regressions using the approach of Newey(1987).
Panel A uses all funding rounds and panel B only examines rounds entirely funded by angels. The
dependent variable is equal to 1 if a board seat was assigned to an angel investor in the financing
round. The logarithm of funds is instrumented with the number of angels and the number of
employees at funding. The percentage ownership is instrumented with the number of employees
and the financing round. First round is equal to one if this is the firm’s first round of outside
financing. Round is the number of outside financing rounds. Age of firm at financing refers
to the number of months since founding. Geography equals one if the closest angel investor is
less than fifty miles away. Previous Entrepreneur equals one if the founders have been previous
R&D
entrepreneurs. Industry Market
Book is the mean 3-digit SIC market to book ratio. Industry Assets is the
aggregate R & D expense to total assets for public firms in the company’s 3-digit SIC industry
Assets
according to COMPUSTAT. Industry Fixed
Total Assets is the median fixed total assets for all (public as
well as closely held) firms with sales less than one million in the company’s 4-digit SIC industry
according to OneSource. Industry Volatility is the volatility of the value weighted industry portfolio
return from months t-61 to t-1 where t is the date of funding, where industries are defined according
to the Fama & French (1997) industry classification. Previous Entrepreneur equals one if the
founders had previously started another venture. The absolute values of z-statistics are reported in
parentheses beneath the coefficients.

This table presents results on the follow on investment behavior of angel investors. Panel A provides frequency data on the number of follow-on investments. Panel B provides information on the percentage of
angels who have funded previous rounds. Panels C and D present probit regressions where the dependent
variable is equal to 1 if a funding round contained investors from previous investment rounds. The independent variables are described in table 4. Industry dummies are included in columns 1-7. All financing rounds
are included in the regressions in panel C. Panel D examines rounds funded by only angels. The absolute
values of White (1980) t-statistics are reported in parentheses beneath the coefficients.

This table presents information on security issuance and other contractual terms. Panel A lists the type of security
used in each round. Panel B reports regression results from probit regressions where the dependent variable equals 1 if
equity is issued and 0 otherwise using all rounds of funding. Panel C reports results using only angel financed rounds.
Columns 1 to 7 of panels B and C include industry dummy variables. Panel D presents the types of dilution protection
for angel investors. The ’Other’ category includes dilution protection such as verbal agreements in the event of a down
round. Panel E provides data on the number of rounds where repurchase agreements are in the contract. A repurchase
option gives the entrepreneur the right to repurchase an angel’s stake in the firm.

<-----Page 60----->Table 11: Syndication and Average Contribution
Panels A and B presents estimates from OLS regressions on average angel contribution. In panel A, the dependent
variable is the logarithm of the average contribution per angel in all financing rounds. Panel B reports results for only
angel financed rounds. Panel C and D reports the results from a instrumental variable regression Poisson regression
as specified in Mullahy(1997). The dependent variable is the number of angel investors. Panel D only uses rounds
entirely financed by angels. The natural logarithm of funds is instrumented by the number of employees and the
presence of venture capital. The other independent variables are defined in table 4. The regressions in columns 1-6
of panels A and B and columns 1-6 of panel C and D have industry dummy variables. The absolute values of White
(1980) t-statistics are reported in parentheses below the coefficients in panels A and B.

<-----Page 64----->Table 12: Post-Investment Assistance
This table presents evidence on the amount of assistance angel financiers provide. Panel A gives
the number of rounds where the angel investors helped form the management team. Panel B
presents results on the determinants of funding duration leading up to venture capital financing.
The dependent variable is the number of months from completion of one funding round until
the completion of the next funding round from venture capital. The distribution of the hazard
duration is assumed to be Weibull. Panel C presents results from ordered logit regressions where
the dependent variable is the amount of help that angel investors provide. Responses are 1 (for very
little or no help) to 5 (the angel provided a great deal of help). The other independent variables are
defined in table 4.
