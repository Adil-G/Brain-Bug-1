Canada’s Venture Capital Industry in Q4 2006
The CVCA – Canada’s Venture Capital and Private Equity Association is pleased to provide the following overview of activity in
the Canadian venture capital market through the full year 2006, including current data for the fourth quarter.
Venture capital investment across Canada in 2006 amounted to $1.69 billion, matching the total of $1.68 billion invested in
2005. In the fourth quarter, total investment amounted to $489 million, just below the $502 million of Q4 2005 but representing a
42% increase over the Q3 2006 level of $344 million.
In spite of these generally flat results across the market as a whole, three significant underlying trends are clearly visible:
•A substantial regional shift away from Ontario and into Quebec and British Columbia,
•A major increase in Canadian investment by foreign (principally U.S.) venture funds, and
•A decline in the number of companies funded, with a corresponding increase in the amount of capital invested per company.
In the broader North American context, the relatively flat Canadian venture capital sector is not participating in the steady growth
of major U.S. markets, and is therefore declining in the regional rankings.
Regional Shift
Quebec performed very strongly in Q4 2006, leading all Canadian provinces with $247 million in venture investments compared
to $104 million in Q3 2006. For the full year, Quebec saw $603 million invested in 179 companies, up 9% from the $552 million
of 2005. British Columbia experienced even stronger growth for the full year 2006, where 52 companies received $298 million
($44 million in Q4), up 30% from the $230 million of 2005.
Growth in these markets contrasted with the decline in Ontario, which attracted $165 million in Q4 2006, consistent with $163
million in Q3 2006 and down 16% from the $197 million of Q4 2005. For the full year 2006, 118 Ontario companies received
investment of $686 million, a decline of 9% from the $755 million reported in 2005.
For the full year 2006, Ontario remained the largest venture capital market in Canada with a 40% share (down from 45% in
2005), followed by Quebec with 36% (up from 33%) and British Columbia at 18% (up from 14%).

Canada’s Venture Capital Industry in Q4 2006…cont’d
Investor Type
For the full year 2006, venture capital investment in Canadian companies from foreign (principally U.S.) VC funds amounted to
$549 million, an increase of 19% from the $460 million they invested in 2005. Foreign VC funds provided 32% of all venture
capital invested in Canadian companies in 2006, up significantly from their historical level in the 25% range (27% in 2005).
Investment by LSVCC’s amounted to $379 million in 2006, down 11% from the $427 million invested by this group in 2005, and
accounting for 22% of all venture investment in Canada in 2006 (from 25% in 2005). Private independent venture funds
invested $334 million in 2006, consistent with the $337 million of 2005 for a repeat 20% market share.
Companies Funded and Deal Sizes
157 Canadian companies were funded by VC firms in Q4 2006, down 25% from the 209 firms of Q4 2005 (up 23% from the 128
firm in Q3 2006). For the full year 2006, a total of 404 Canadian companies received venture funding, the lowest number since
1995 and 28% below the 560 companies funded in 2005.
The decline in the number of companies funded – but not the total capital invested – led to a substantial increase in the average
amount invested per company, a positive trend. The average Canadian VC investment in 2006 was $4.2 million, up 40% from
the $3.0 million average in 2005.
North American Context
The CVCA has released data showing where the major Canadian markets rank in reported venture capital investment relative to
activity in individual U.S. states. Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia finished 2006 in 9th, 10th and 17th place, respectively,
compared to 2005 standings of 7th, 9th and 20th place.
The relative decline of Canada’s major markets arises from their overall flat performance compared to the steady growth in the
U.S. venture capital market, which invested US$25.5 billion in 2006, up 12% from the US$22.8 billion of 2005. U.S. venture
funds continue to invest substantially larger amounts than their Canadian counterparts in each of their portfolio companies with
an average level of $10.1 million per company, or 2.4 times the Canadian average (although this differential is narrowing).

Canada’s Venture Capital Industry in Q4 2006…cont’d
Investment by Sector
Activity in the Information Technology sectors continued to drive industry investment in 2006, with $882 million placed into 183
companies representing 52% of all disbursements (compared to $914 million in 2005). Within the IT sector, software led with
$311 million (compared to $300 million in 2005), followed by communications and networking with $238 million (compared to
$333 million in 2005), and electronics and semiconductors at $205 million (compared to $161 million in 2005).
Biopharmaceutical and other life science investments increased in 2006 with 78 companies receiving $493 million (compared to
$438 million in 2005). Venture investment in environmental “clean” technologies amounted to $119 million in 2006, an increase
of 83% from 2005 and the highest amount invested on record.
VC industry fundraising
Fund-raising by the Canadian VC industry dropped substantially in 2006 after experiencing a strong growth year in 2005. New
funding raised by venture capital funds amounted to $1.6 billion in 2006, a drop of 26% from the total of $2.2 billion raised in
2005.
LSVCC’s raised $907 million in 2006 down 25% from the $1.2 billion raised in 2005. The new LSVCC capital was
overwhelmingly concentrated in Quebec, which received 85% of the national total.
Canadian private independent funds raised $666 million in new commitments in 2006, essentially matching the $672 million
raised in 2005.
