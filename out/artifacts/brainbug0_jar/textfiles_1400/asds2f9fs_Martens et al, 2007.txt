DO THE STORIES THEY TELL GET THEM THE MONEY THEY
NEED? THE ROLE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL NARRATIVES IN
RESOURCE ACQUISITION

Adopting a narrative approach to resource acquisition research, we examine the
effects of storytelling on a firm’s ability to secure capital. We argue that narratives help
leverage resources by conveying a comprehensible identity for an entrepreneurial
firm, elaborating the logic behind proposed means of exploiting opportunities and
embedding entrepreneurial endeavors within broader discourses. Qualitative analyses
of all 1996–2000 initial public offering prospectuses in three high-tech industries
reveal how identity constructions, story elaboration, and contextual embedding are
invoked within narratives. Our quantitative findings show how these aspects of an
entrepreneurial narrative impact resource acquisition net of previously emphasized
factors.

exists on the relationship between entrepreneurial
storytelling and external resource acquisition. One
important exception is O’Connor’s (2004) pioneering work, which documented how the founders of a
new venture deliberately and successively reshaped their company story to enhance the likelihood of securing investment capital. Although offering a provocative behind-the-scenes glimpse
into the story-crafting process, her single-case design limits the conclusions that can be drawn about
the effects of storytelling on resource acquisition in
entrepreneurial firms. As a result, it is not known
whether the stories that entrepreneurs tell help
them garner the resources they need to pursue
identified entrepreneurial opportunities.
To our knowledge, this paper offers the first systematic, large-sample test of the overarching claim
that effective storytelling can facilitate external resource acquisition. Integrating theory and research
on the resource acquisition process with work by
narrative scholars, we develop and test three arguments about how narratives (stories) help entrepreneurs attract capital. Our first argument is that stories help potential resource providers comprehend
an entrepreneurial firm’s identity by packaging factual information about the firm’s stock of tangible
and intangible capital into a simpler, more coherent and meaningful whole. The second is that stories help prospective investors understand the nature and potential value of a firm’s proposed means
of exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities by elab-

Although the “linguistic turn” may have taken
longer to reach the entrepreneurship literature than
other areas of organizational research (Hjorth &
Steyaert, 2004: 3), there is increasing recognition
that storytelling is an essential component of an
entrepreneur’s toolkit. Successful entrepreneurs often possess reputations as effective “raconteurs”
(Smith & Anderson, 2004: 126), with some of the
most successful themselves professing that “every
entrepreneur is a great storyteller” (Roddick, 2000:
40). Accordingly, a growing number of researchers
have called attention to the role that stories play in
the entrepreneurial process—particularly for the
critical yet challenging task of attracting resources
from external sources (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; O’Connor, 2004; Porac,
Mishina, & Pollock, 2002).
As of yet, however, very little empirical research

orating the reasoning behind its intended strategic
initiatives. The third is that stories help generate
interest and commitment among potential resource
providers by connecting to broader contextual narratives in such a way that the proposed endeavor
appears original and distinctive—yet not so farfetched that its soundness is questionable. Combined, these arguments suggest that effective storytelling not only reduces the perceived uncertainty
and risk associated with the exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (cf. Cohen & Dean, 2005;
Pollock & Rindova, 2003; Shane, 2003; Stuart, Hoang, & Hybels, 1999), but also motivates and mobilizes potential resource providers into committing
capital to an entrepreneurial enterprise.
We use a mixed-methodology design to explore
these arguments, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques in our approach (Lee, 1999: 14).
Our sample for both types of analyses consisted of
all semiconductor (n ⫽ 53), biotechnology (n ⫽ 56),
and Internet content provider (n ⫽ 59) firms that
issued initial public offerings (IPOs) on one of the
major U.S. stock exchanges from 1996 to 2000. We
considered IPO firms to be a valuable initial focus
for research on the relationship between entrepreneurial storytelling and resource acquisition for
two reasons. First, the written prospectus that each
firm must file contains required sections that not
only facilitate risk assessments (Bhabra & Pettway,
2003; MacCrimmon & Martens, 2001) but also allow for systematic and comparative textual analysis. Second, although IPOs may be issued for reasons other than resource acquisition, those that are
successful nevertheless infuse firms with large
amounts of externally provided capital. As such,
the issuance of an IPO represents a significant milestone in the life of an entrepreneurial venture
(Shane, 2003: 6).
THE USE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL
NARRATIVES IN RESOURCE ACQUISITION:
THEORY, QUALITATIVE FINDINGS, AND
EMERGENT HYPOTHESES
Resource acquisition features prominently in the
entrepreneurship literature. Regardless of whether
entrepreneurship itself is conceptualized as the
discovery and exploitation of opportunities, or as
the creation of a new venture, the process of acquiring resources such as financial, physical, human,
and intangible capital from others is commonly
acknowledged to be a vital entrepreneurial task
(Shane, 2003; Starr & MacMillan, 1990). Obtaining
adequate capital not only enables an entrepreneurial firm to pursue identified opportunities, but also
facilitates its ability to survive, grow, and generate

October

profits (Brush, Greene, & Hart, 2001; Shane, 2003).
Building a resource base, however, is widely recognized as a complex and challenging undertaking—perhaps even “the greatest challenge faced by
entrepreneurs” (Brush et al., 2001: 71). The challenge stems from information asymmetry and from
uncertainty about the value of entrepreneurial opportunities and a firm’s ability to exploit them.
That is, resource providers tend to possess less
information than entrepreneurs about certain opportunities and their proposed means of exploiting
these opportunities; moreover, the value of those
opportunities is largely unknown prior to their exploitation (Shane, 2003: 165–166; see also Stuart et
al., 1999).
To date, much resource acquisition research has
focused on two means by which entrepreneurs attempt to cope with the above-noted challenges: relying on social ties and signaling quality. The social
tie approach emphasizes the facilitative role played
by an entrepreneur’s direct or indirect connections
to potential capital providers (e.g., Hall & Hofer,
1993; Steier & Greenwood, 1995, 2000). This approach has been criticized, however, for failing to
satisfactorily explain either the processes by which
entrepreneurs leverage their existing relationships
to secure additional capital (Baron & Markman,
2003; Starr & MacMillan, 1990) or the ability of
many entrepreneurs without prior connections to
prospective investors to acquire external resources
(Shane, 2003; see also Bhide, 2000). The quality
signaling approach emphasizes the facilitative role
played by signals of an entrepreneurial firm’s quality, such as its “track record,” top management
team characteristics, certifications and endorsements, and affiliations with high-status third parties (e.g., Shane & Cable, 2002; Shane & Stuart,
2002; Stuart et al., 1999). This approach too has
been criticized for not yet providing a full understanding of the mechanisms by which these indicators of a firm’s existing capital stock are leveraged to attract additional, externally provided
resources (Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001).
One way of addressing these shortcomings is to
focus instead on the behaviors that entrepreneurs
engage in when attempting to convince resource
providers to commit capital to their endeavors
(Shane, 2003). Although some scholars have called
attention to the use of impression management and
influence strategies more generally (e.g., Baron &
Markman, 2000; 2003; Brush et al., 2001; Starr &
MacMillan, 1990), others have called attention to
the roles played by language, communication, and
storytelling more specifically (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;
Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; O’Connor, 2004; Porac et
al., 2002). Stories, or narratives, are temporally se-

<-----Page 2----->2007

Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

quenced accounts of interrelated events or actions
undertaken by characters (Barry & Elmes, 1997;
Czarniawska, 1998; Gabriel, 2004). Entrepreneurial
narratives are the stories that are told about entrepreneurs and/or their firms.
Like stories more generally, entrepreneurial narratives can be shared through a variety of modes,
chiefly the oral and the written (Alvesson & Karreman, 2000; Barry & Elmes, 1997; Grant, Hardy,
Oswick, & Putnam, 2004). One example of the oral
mode is the extemporaneous stories, or “small narratives” (Hjorth & Steyaert, 2004: 4), that entrepreneurs share in their everyday conversations with
employees, customers, and suppliers. Another example is the more scripted narratives told within
formal presentations to such audiences as bankers,

1109

venture capitalists, and media representatives. Examples of the written mode include the story segments, or “minimal narratives” (Czarniawska,
1998: 17), that appear on promotional materials
such as company brochures, Web sites, and product packages, as well as the fuller narratives that
appear in documents such as annual reports, business plans, and IPO prospectuses.
Table 1 illustrates the use of the narrative form
within the IPO prospectuses analyzed for this
study. According to Fiol (1989), narratives contain
three essential elements: a narrative subject, an object or ultimate goal that the subject is in search of,
and a set of forces that enable or impede the subject
from attaining the desired object or goal. According
to other organizational narrativists, stories also pos-

sess an implicit or explicit temporal sequencing
that provides a sense of plot (Barry & Elmes, 1997;
Czarniawska, 1998; Gabriel, 2004). These fundamental aspects of the narrative form were easily
discernable within the business section of each
prospectus. As illustrated in Table 1, each contained a clearly identified subject (e.g., “We are a
leading provider of epitaxial equipment and related
components”), an explicitly stated goal (e.g., “Our
objective is to be an industry leader in the discovery and optimization of new drug candidates”), and
a set of specific enabling forces (e.g., “We believe
creating brand recognition will be critical”). Moreover, each contained an implicit temporal sequence. The semiconductor excerpts, for example,
described what a firm had done in the past (“For 14
years, we have offered products and services. . .”),
what it was in the present (“We are [now] a leading
provider of epitaxial equipment. . .”), and what it
would be in the future (“Our goal is to become the
leading supplier. . .”; emphasis added).
Organizational narrativists believe that stories
are a fundamental, preferred, and particularly effective means of communicating, “sense-making,”
and “sense-giving” (e.g., Boje, 1991; Weick, 1995).
Building on this premise, we suggest that storytelling helps entrepreneurs leverage their existing resource endowments so as to secure additional investment capital. We propose three ways in which
entrepreneurial narratives can act as resource levers: (1) by conveying a comprehensible identity
for an entrepreneurial firm, (2) by elaborating the
logic behind proposed means of exploiting opportunities, and (3) by embedding entrepreneurial endeavors in broader contextual discourses. We develop each of these arguments below, providing
rich illustrative data from the qualitative component of our analysis.
Conveying Comprehensible Identities for
Entrepreneurial Firms
Theoretical arguments. Our first point is that
narratives play a critical role in conveying an entrepreneurial firm’s identity (O’Connor, 2002,
2004). The narrative form represents “an essential
logic used by human beings for self-presentation”
(O’Connor, 2004: 109). Stories help individuals understand and describe who they are. By telling stories in which they play leading roles, individuals
“construct” themselves as “characters” whose attributes can be revealed and communicated (Gergen, 1999). Thus, narratives shape not only how
individuals view themselves, but also how others
view them. This function of narratives in general
also applies to entrepreneurial narratives, which

October

are primarily designed to create as comprehensible
an identity as possible for an entrepreneurial firm
(Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001;
O’Connor, 2004; Santos & Eisenhardt, 2004).
But why do narrative theorists consider stories to
be a particularly effective means of constructing
and conveying a social entity’s identity? The main
argument is that stories configure “apparently independent and disconnected elements of existence” into “related parts of a whole” (Barry &
Elmes, 1997: 431). Stories do more than just present
“facts as information” (Gabriel, 2004: 64); they “represent” facts in an elegant way (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 127). By presenting facts as part of a
complex whole, organizational stories are more
easily learned and remembered by others (Shaw,
Brown, & Bromiley, 1998: 42). Likewise, we expect
that entrepreneurial narratives help convey a more
comprehensible and memorable identity for firms
seeking external capital by encoding and ordering
facts about their existing resource endowments
within an overarching framework. As with stories
more generally, this overarching framework likely
involves temporal sequencing (Gabriel, 2004). In
the case of entrepreneurial narratives, temporal sequencing does more than just provide a logic to link
facts about a firm’s resource stocks together—it also
makes those facts appear more certain by recasting
the firm’s history as a natural progression.
As such, information about an entrepreneurial
firm’s identity that is presented within a narrative
format can help entrepreneurs overcome the two
key challenges that hinder external resource acquisition: information asymmetry and uncertainty (cf.
Shane, 2003: 165). More specifically, by packaging
information about a firm’s existing resource endowments into an appealing format, narratives can
help decrease information asymmetry between prospective investors and entrepreneurs regarding the
latter’s ability to exploit identified opportunities.
In turn, this should make it easier for potential
resource providers to evaluate the likelihood that
the entrepreneurs will be able to realize the profit
potential of their proposed initiatives, thereby also
reducing perceived uncertainty. Identities that are
effectively constructed and conveyed within entrepreneurial narratives can thus facilitate resource
acquisition.
Qualitative analysis, findings, and emergent
hypothesis. Our qualitative analysis offers rich descriptive insights into how the entrepreneurial
firms in our sample constructed their identities
through the narratives in their IPO prospectuses.
One of our first observations was that these entrepreneurial narratives did, in fact, encode specific
information about firms’ existing stocks of tangible

<-----Page 4----->2007

Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

and intangible capital within themselves, thereby
providing signals of the ventures’ quality (as emphasized by Lounsbury and Glynn [2001]). The excerpts from the semiconductor company presented
in Table 1, for example, draw attention to the company’s affiliations with high-status third parties
(“We have established close working relationships
with leading compound semiconductor manufacturers”), track record (“We have a history of innovations”), and intellectual capital (“We also intend
to expand our intellectual property portfolio”).
We also noticed that the prospectuses appeared
to construct and convey a common set of overarching identities for the entrepreneurial firms. To explore this impression more systematically, we conducted a latent content analysis—that is, “an
interpretive reading of the symbolism underlying
the physical data [of a text]” in which we focused
on the “deep structural meaning conveyed by the
message” (Berg, 2004: 269). To do this, one of the
authors carefully read the business section of each
prospectus in its entirety, noting the essence of the
narrative’s story line and underlying “pitch” to the
intended audience of potential investors. The second and third authors then examined these notes,
looking for common story lines and underlying
pitches. Convergence was attained quickly, resulting in six latent identity constructions. We then
classified each narrative into one of these six categories, using the forced-choice method adopted by
Suddaby and Greenwood (2005). This step was
completed by two independent coders: an author
and a student majoring in finance who was familiar
with IPO prospectuses and trained on the coding
protocol we used. The initial level of interrater
agreement was 79 percent; we discuss the reason
for this percentage below. Table 2 summarizes the
results of the identity construction classification.
As indicated in Table 2, a sizeable proportion of
the entrepreneurial firms (29 percent) portrayed
themselves as established leaders. These firms’
prospectuses touted them as the original pioneers
and current leaders of an industry and thus as “safe
bets” for potential investors. An even higher proportion (40 percent) were portrayed as aspiring
leaders, but their narratives differed in noticeable
ways: some emphasized a firm’s track record (6
percent); others focused primarily on the firm’s
strategic plans (11 percent); and the remainder
stressed its social ties (23 percent). A much smaller
proportion of the entrepreneurial firms’ prospectuses (9 percent) portrayed the firms as potential
contenders—that is, as innovators on the brink of
commercialization. The representation of these
firms as potentially lucrative “long shots” for potential investors came closest to reflecting the

1111

premise that “emerging organizations are elaborate
fictions of proposed possible future states of existence” (Gartner, Bird, & Starr, 1992: 17). An even
smaller proportion of the firms (1 percent) were
portrayed in almost the converse manner, as potential noncontenders that would likely cease to exist
if outside investors did not rescue them. In sum,
these identity constructions not only conveyed signals about a firm’s market leadership position (as
noted by Santos and Eisenhardt [2004]), but also
conveyed varying degrees of credibility (as implied
by Lounsbury and Glynn [2001]), with the established leaders and potential noncontenders appearing most and least credible, respectively.
The remaining entrepreneurial firms (21 percent)
appeared to possess ambiguous identity constructions. These were the cases in which the categories
assigned by the two independent coders did not
match. We considered them to be ambiguous because, when the coders met to discuss their decisions, it became apparent that the discrepancies
weren’t attributable to misapplications of the coding protocol, but rather to ambiguity within the
narratives themselves. That is, each of the coders
could see how the narrative could be classified into
the category assigned by the other. Although it is
possible that the ambiguity was unintentional in
most instances, it is also plausible that some of
these narratives were deliberately crafted in this
manner. Research on ambiguity in organizations
has shown that ambiguously presented information
can have a more favorable impact on recipients
than explicitly and unambiguously presented negative information (Eisenberg, 1984). It is possible
that the ambiguity inherent in some of the entrepreneurial narratives was deliberately used to conceal a less-than-appealing entrepreneurial firm
identity. Such an interpretation seems consistent
with Lounsbury and Glynn’s intriguing speculation
that “entrepreneurial accounts about their stock of
capital may be inaccurate or even intentionally
misleading” (2001: 561; see also Santos & Eisenhardt, 2004).
Following on the above point, another impression that we formed upon reading the IPO narratives was that the information provided about an
entrepreneurial firm’s existing resource endowments seemed to be selectively presented so as to
convey a certain identity for it. In some instances,
for example, the narratives contained phrases suggesting that a firm was an established leader even
though, in our opinion, insufficient factual information was presented to support such a claim. A
comparison of the characteristics of Axcelis, as presented in Table 3, with those of Integrated Circuits
illustrates this observation. Their IPO prospectuses

portrayed both of these semiconductor firms as established leaders, yet they differed considerably in
actual resource stocks. Axcelis had the highest
overall resource factor score in our sample,
whereas Integrated Circuits had only an average
score.1 Moreover, Integrated Circuits’ score was
close to that for Intrinsic, which portrayed itself as
an aspiring leader rather than as an established
leader. Thus, it seemed to us that some firms were
being represented somewhat inauthentically—as
something more than they were in reality.
In other instances, we noted that the IPO narratives emphasized certain facts while downplaying
or virtually suppressing others, thereby conveying
a particular identity for a firm (e.g., an aspiring
leader with a track record) when another could
have justifiably been portrayed (e.g., an aspiring
leader with social ties). A comparison of Intrinsic
and RF Micro Devices in Table 3 illustrates this
impression. Both of these firms had similar overall
resource factor scores and comparable constituent
stocks of tangible and intangible capital. Yet the
narrative for Intrinsic emphasized its track record,
whereas that for RF Micro Devices emphasized its
ties to other organizations. Thus, the identities conveyed for these two firms were noticeably different— even though their resource stocks were very
similar.
We also noted that some narratives conveyed a
less credible identity for an entrepreneurial firm
than that suggested by other sources of information
about its resource endowments. Firm E (ZiLOG),
for example, possessed a very high overall resource
factor score and specific resource stocks comparable to those of Axcelis. Yet ZiLOG’s IPO prospectus
represented the firm’s identity in an ambiguous
manner, whereas Axcelis was represented as an
established leader. Thus, it seemed to us that some
prospecutses did not portray their focal firms in the
most adept manner possible.
To further explore the relationship between
firms’ extant resources and the identities portrayed
in their entrepreneurial narratives, we cross-tabulated each firm’s resource factor score (coded as
“low,” “moderate,” or “high”) with its identity construction (coded as “an established leader” or “not
an established leader”). Although firms with low

We derived firms’ resource factor scores from a principal components analysis (with a forced single factor
and varimax rotation) of four resource stock facts: (1)
logged prior revenues (in US$ millions), (2) total number
of patents owned and pending, (3) total years of industry
tenure for the top management team, and (4) the existence of any strategic alliances.

resource factor scores were much less likely than
those with high resource factor scores to portray
themselves as established leaders, two of the lowresource firms (9 percent) were described in this
manner. Moreover, almost equivalent proportions
of the high-resource firms (36 percent) and the
moderate-resource firms (31 percent) possessed established-leader identity constructions. Thus, the
resultant chi-square value for the cross-tabulation
was only marginally significant (␹2 ⫽ 5.43, p ⫽ .07).
This additional analysis provides further evidence
to suggest that entrepreneurial storytellers have at
least some latitude when it comes to “re-presenting” the facts about their extant capital stocks.
In sum, then, the qualitative findings presented
thus far reveal that the narratives told within IPO
prospectuses constitute more than just lists or chronologies of factual information about an entrepreneurial firm’s existing resource endowments.
Rather, the authors of such documents, like storytellers more generally, appear to have at least some
freedom to “mould material for effect . . . while
[claiming] to be representing reality” (Gabriel,
2004: 64). This observation is noteworthy given
that IPO prospectuses are legal documents that are
supposed to contain truthful and complete information (Lowry & Shu, 2002). The question, however, is whether the identities that prospectuses
convey influence potential resource providers
when the effects of the factual information about
stocks of capital that the providers could attain
elsewhere are controlled for. Drawing on the work
of organizational narrative scholars summarized at
the outset of this section, we hypothesize that identity constructions will have an additive effect:
Hypothesis 1. The identity constructed for a
firm in an entrepreneurial narrative has an
influence on resource acquisition that is net of
the influence of factual information about the
firm’s existing resource endowments.
Making Sense of Proposed Means of Exploiting
Identified Opportunities
Theoretical arguments. Thus far, we have focused on narratives as a powerful means to convey
an entrepreneurial firm’s identity (i.e., what the
firm is). But narratives are also an effective means
of communicating an entrepreneurial firm’s actions
(i.e., what it is doing or will do—its current or
intended actions). As with identity, however, a potential investor’s assessment of an entrepreneurial
firm’s intended actions is likely to be fraught with
information asymmetry and uncertainty. This is
because resource providers typically possess less

<-----Page 8----->2007

Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

knowledge than entrepreneurs about the potential
value of proposed entrepreneurial initiatives, the
profitability of which is fundamentally unknown
(Shane, 2003: 165). We suggest that effectively
crafted narratives can help firms overcome these
additional resource acquisition challenges.
Our starting point here is that narratives represent an excellent forum through which entrepreneurs can articulate why their proposed means of
exploiting identified opportunities are sensible,
given the circumstances faced by their firms. Narrative theorists suggest that stories, in general, are a
fundamental tool by which humans make sense of
ambiguous situations and communicate their insights to others (Bruner, 1986; Gioia & Chittipeddi,
1995; O’Connor, 2004; Weick, 1995). Stories act as
sense-making and sense-giving devices by linking
causes and effects, both within and between different parts of the narratives (Gabriel, 2004). As such,
they are often used to explain a social entity’s actions (past, present, or future), making those actions appear justified and/or plausible within a
given context (Barry & Elmes, 1997; Smith & Anderson, 2004).
Referring to organizational actions more specifically, Shaw and colleagues (1998) argued that strategic plans presented in a narrative format create a
richer picture for audience members. A narrative
logic “forces to the surface the writer’s buried assumptions about cause and effect” (Shaw et al.,
1998: 46). Thus, stories allow for the author’s
“thinking about the relationships between concepts
to come through,” which enables readers to more
easily grasp the connections contributing to the
writer’s insight (Shaw et al., 1998: 47). When such
thought processes are made explicit, they can be
held up against the reader’s own mental models,
thereby placing “audience members in a better position to evaluate the plan critically” (Shaw et al.,
1998: 47). If the resulting critical assessment is
positive, audience members will be more receptive
to the proposed initiatives.
Likewise, narratives have been touted as an ideal
forum through which entrepreneurs can explicate
their “personal theories of managerial action” (Porac et al., 2002: 117), thereby providing “a rationale
for the arguably irrational risks of enterprising”
(Smith & Anderson, 2004: 127). If understood and
accepted by potential resource providers, the theories or rationales presented in an entrepreneurial
narrative can decrease information asymmetry,
thereby facilitating resource acquisition. To be
even more effective as a resource acquisition tool,
however, these theories or rationales must also reduce uncertainty. One way of doing so is to “frame
risk in a way that is more acceptable to investors”

1115

(Shane, 2003: 185; see also Bhidé, 2000; Roberts,
1991). This can by accomplished by elaborating
how the proposed means of exploiting identified
opportunities help attenuate the risks that an entrepreneurial firm is facing. As illustrated below,
however, the content of entrepreneurial narratives
can vary considerably in this regard— even when
such explanations are a mandated component, as is
the case for the accounts presented within IPO
prospectuses (Beatty & Welch, 1996; Lowry & Shu,
2002).
Qualitative analysis, findings, and emergent
hypothesis. Upon reading the rationales provided
for the IPO firms’ intended strategic actions, we
were struck by the variation among the prospectuses. Some elaborated numerous, often interrelated, ways in which a firm’s proposed means of
exploiting identified opportunities would reduce
the risks that it was facing, yet others offered only a
few such causal connections. To explore this impression more systematically, we created a “story
map” for each prospectus, examples of which appear in Figure 1. As illustrated, each map represents a network-like array of the risks and intended
strategic actions listed in a prospectus. Each risk
and strategy is a node, and each pair of nodes is
connected if the proposed strategy was explicitly
described as a means of attenuating an identified
risk factor.
To identify the risks and strategies, we conducted a manifest content analysis. In contrast to
the latent content analysis described earlier, this
component of our qualitative analysis involved
coding “those elements that are physically present
and countable [in a text]” (Berg, 2004: 269). In our
case, the focal elements were the intended strategic
actions identified by the headers in the strategy
section of a prospectus as well as the identified risk
factors listed in the risk factor section. For each
prospectus, two research assistants separately
coded each intended strategic action into 1 of 17
categories, such as “product diversity strategy” or
“technological leadership,” and each identified
risk factor into 1 of 76 categories, such as “dependence on a key supplier” or “lengthy sales cycle”
(for a more detailed description of the typology
developed to code the risk-strategy maps, see Martens [2002]). Initial interrater agreement was very
high—95 percent for the strategic actions and 86
percent for the risk factors—and the remaining differences were discussed until complete agreement
was reached. The two coders then identified the
links among the risk-strategy nodes; once a consensus had been reached, they constructed a story map
using Decision Explorer (Banxia Software, 2001).
The two story maps presented in Figure 1 differ

markedly in the density of their risk-strategy links,
and hence in the degree to which the entrepreneurial narratives elaborated how the proposed initiatives would attenuate the risks the firms were facing. As illustrated, the story map for the firm
Go2Net is considerably denser, containing 103
links in comparison to Commonwealth Biotechnologies’ 27. Looking at the density of Go2Net’s story
map, however, we wonder if such an elaborate
narrative might be too complex for readers to follow. Although some degree of elaboration is undoubtedly necessary for potential investors to comprehend an entrepreneurial firm’s proposed
initiatives and deem them sensible, it is also likely
that explicating a very large number of risk-strategy
links will confuse investors about the firm’s direction and cause them to question the entrepreneurs’
understanding of core success factors—which
would heighten rather than reduce the investors’
skepticism. This scenario seems especially plausible, given that one of the key objectives of narratives about entrepreneurial firms is to “simplify the
complex” (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 130; see also
Aldrich & Fiol, 1994: 651).
Such reasoning is consistent with research on the
psychology of persuasion. According to both the
heuristic-systematic model (Chaiken, 1980) and the
elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Wegener,
1999), people tend to focus on the central features
of a message—such as the strength of the argument—when their capacity and motivation to process information is high. These conditions are
likely to exist for readers of IPO prospectuses, most
of whom are institutional investors who are potentially committing substantial resources to an entrepreneurial venture (Bhabra & Pettway, 2003;
Ljungqvist & Wilhelm, 2002). Under such conditions, the prediction based on the heuristic-systematic and elaboration likelihood models is that readers will attend closely to the merits of the argument
being presented; such conditions, however, also
provoke readers to find faults in the argument’s
logic and to give those faults more weight (Killeya
& Johnson, 1998; Rucker & Petty, 2006). As a result,
“stronger claims may . . . encourage unwanted
counterarguments” and thus backfire, leading to
negative attitudes and behaviors (Cline & Kellaris,
1999: 72). Falbe and Yukl (1992), for example, demonstrated that rational persuasion (i.e., providing
logical arguments) is as likely to generate resistance
to an influence attempt as it is likely to foster compliance or commitment. Moreover, Elsbach and
Elofson (2000) showed that difficult-to-understand
rationales, in particular, lower assessments of a
“sender’s” trustworthiness, which may decrease
willingness to comply. In light of the extant theory

1117

and research on the psychology of persuasion, we
therefore hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2. Elaborating the rationale behind
a firm’s intended actions in an entrepreneurial
narrative has a positive, but diminishing, effect
on the firm’s resource acquisition ability.
Generating Interest and Commitment through
Contextual Embedding
Theoretical arguments. In addition to conveying
comprehensible identities for entrepreneurial firms
and sensible rationales for their proposed initiatives, effectively constructed entrepreneurial narratives must also pique the interest of potential resource providers. As Smith and Anderson put it,
stories about entrepreneurial firms aren’t meant
just to “legitimize entrepreneurial actions”; they
are also meant to “provoke us, challenge us, and
transform us” (2004: 131). In other words, influential entrepreneurial narratives answer the proverbial “So what?” question effectively. Similarly, organizational narrative scholars argue that
successful stories don’t just inform readers; they
generate interest and commitment, thereby motivating audience members to act in a manner consistent with the author’s intended outcomes (Shaw
et al., 1998; see also Boje, Oswick, & Ford, 2004;
Rindova, Becerra, & Contardo, 2004). To generate
interest and commitment, narratives must resonate
with their intended audiences (Hardy, Palmer, &
Phillips, 2000; Hjorth & Steyaert, 2004; Lounsbury
& Glynn, 2001). A primary means by which storytellers achieve resonance is by attending closely to
the sociocultural context in which they are crafting
their stories (Barry & Elmes, 1997). Being embedded in a larger discursive context gives a story
greater meaning for the individuals to whom it is
directed (Hardy et al., 2000). Likewise, cultural entrepreneurship scholars suggest that the stories told
by entrepreneurs need to invoke symbolic devices
that connect their ideas to “pre-existing, ongoing
and encompassing conversations” (O’Connor,
2004: 105), thereby “anchor[ing] their reality in
context” (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 128; see also
Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001;
Suddaby & Greenwood, 2005).
The challenge for storytellers is to ensure that
their narratives are appropriately positioned vis-àvis established cultural accounts. To accomplish
this, effective narrativists borrow familiar symbols,
so that their stories are understandable within a
given discursive context and deliver verisimilitude—yet they also invoke original symbols, so that
their stories stand out from others and deliver a

<-----Page 11----->1118

Academy of Management Journal

different way of viewing the established order
(Barry & Elmes, 1997; Gabriel, 2004; Hardy et al.,
2000). Effective entrepreneurial storytellers are
likely to do the same, incorporating both familiar
and unfamiliar contextual elements into their narratives, so that their proposed endeavors appear
less risky yet also highly intriguing.
Qualitative analysis, findings, and emergent
hypothesis. Our qualitative analysis offers descriptive insights into how entrepreneurial storytellers
embed both contextually familiar and contextually
unfamiliar elements within their narratives. In
reading the IPO prospectuses and creating the story
maps described earlier, we noticed that pursuing a
mix of common and less common strategic initiatives was frequently portrayed as an intention. To
explore this impression more systematically, we
compared the strategies articulated in a focal entrepreneurial narrative against the entire set of strategies mentioned in all prospectuses issued by firms
in the same industry during the 12 months prior to
our analysis. Table 4 contains illustrative data.
As indicated in Table 4, the prospectus for Applied Micro Circuits stated the intention of pursuing four strategic initiatives, two of which (“niche
marketing” and “technological leadership”) were
commonly articulated by other semiconductor
firms that had recently issued IPOs, and two of
which (“leverage client base” and “product devel-

October

opment”) were infrequently articulated by the others. In contrast, Commonwealth Biotechnologies
claimed to be pursuing only one strategy frequently
mentioned in the biotech industry at the time of its
IPO (“product diversity”) and two rarely mentioned initiatives (“build market awareness” and
“expand market share”). The Internet content provider Go2Net was more like the semiconductor
firm Applied Micro Circuits, claiming intent to
pursue a more balanced combination of commonly
articulated strategies (“niche marketing” and “strategic alliances”) and less frequently mentioned
ones (“acquiring market acceptance” and “product
development”).
These qualitative findings suggest that the entrepreneurial firms in our sample tended to be described as pursuing a mix of strategies that were
either widely articulated or infrequently articulated by others within their various industries. As a
result, their entrepreneurial narratives appeared to
incorporate both familiar symbols from the broader
contextual discourse and unfamiliar symbols that
would likely appear distinctive within the encompassing industry-level conversation. Although it is
likely that the storytellers unwittingly invoked
these two forms of contextual embedding, it is also
plausible that some of the narratives were deliberately crafted to contain both familiar and unfamiliar elements. As Aldrich and Fiol surmised, “En-

trepreneurs need to disguise the truly radical
nature of their new activity and the challenge it
may pose to established organizations, while simultaneously making a case that they are different
enough to hold a comparative advantage” (1994:
652). This conjecture accords with the more general
principle of optimal distinctiveness, according to
which individuals are most comfortable with social
representations that balance needs for similarity
and uniqueness (Brewer, 1991).
We wonder, however, about the effectiveness of
entrepreneurial narratives that combine a very large
number of both commonly articulated and infrequently articulated strategic initiatives within
them. Social cognition research indicates that
when an unknown entity is depicted in a way that
taps many categories of social identification, evaluators are likely to experience “recognition confusion” (Brewer, Weber, & Carini, 1995). This cognitive burden is particularly pronounced when an
evaluator has no prior experience with the social
categories being tapped (Chen & Chaiken, 1999), as
would be the case for prospective investors reading
an entrepreneurial narrative containing a large
number of unfamiliar strategic initiatives. Under
such conditions, research has shown that individuals tend to exhibit more discrepant assessments of
the entity under evaluation (Brewer & Feinstein,
1999). As such, although it is possible that some
potential resource providers may respond positively to an entrepreneurial narrative containing a
large number of familiar and unfamiliar strategies,
it is also plausible that others will react negatively
to such accounts. The implication, then, is:
Hypothesis 3. Embedding both contextually familiar and contextually unfamiliar elements in
an entrepreneurial narrative has a positive, but
diminishing, effect on resource acquisition
ability.

THE EFECTIVENESS OF NARRATIVES AS A
RESOURCE ACQUISITION TOOL:
QUANTITATIVE METHODS AND FINDINGS
Data
Our sample for testing the above hypotheses consisted of the entire population of 169 semiconductor, biotechnology, and Internet content provider
firms that filed an intent to issue an IPO on the
NYSE, NASDAQ, or AMEX stock exchanges between mid 1996 and the fall of 2000, as recorded in
the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) in the U.S. Securities and

1119

Exchange Commission Web site.2 One firm, ASE
Semiconductors, was eliminated from our analyses
because of its extreme size. Eighteen firms were
eliminated from some analyses because they withdrew from the IPO process after filing their intent to
go public. Checks revealed that these firms did not
differ significantly from those that completed the
IPO process in terms of both their existing resource
stocks and the nature of their entrepreneurial narratives. Moreover, the inclusion of the withdrawn
firms in our analyses of preliminary resource acquisition revealed a pattern of effects similar to
those for the issuing firms. Thus, our “surviving”
group of IPO firms did not appear to be systematically biased.
Dependent Variables
In our analyses, we utilized three dependent
variables to capture a firm’s ability to acquire externally provided capital at different stages of the
IPO process and its overall effectiveness in doing
so. The first was the issue valuation premium, calculated as the difference between the pre-IPO book
value per share and the IPO issue price, multiplied
by the number of shares issued to subscribers, all
transformed to logarithms (Stuart et al., 1999). This
variable captured the net dollars raised by an IPO
firm that it could directly use as its own capital.
Similar variables, especially issue price premium
adjusted for share numbers, have been used to measure the value added by entrepreneurs at this stage
(Nelson, 2003; Rasheed, Datta, & Chinta, 1997; Welbourne & Andrews, 1996). Data on the pre-IPO book
value, issue pricing, and shares issued were obtained from the Securities Data Corporation database and verified by the 424B filing on EDGAR.
Our second dependent variable was the retail
market valuation premium, which was calculated
as the difference between the first-day market closing price and the IPO issue price, multiplied by the
number of shares outstanding, all logged. This variable captured the net change in a firm’s valuation at
the end of first-day trading relative to its IPO issue
price. Although a firm does not have direct access
to these resources, this dependent variable was useful for two reasons. First, it should have been sensitive to the stories told about firms because the
broader market uses IPO prospectuses, along with
other information sources, to assess candidates for
investment purposes (Bhabra & Pettway, 2003).
Second, this variable might have captured some of

2

html.

<-----Page 13----->1120

Academy of Management Journal

the value added by the stories that the entrepreneurial ventures should have earned but did not,
owing to underpricing (Loughran & Ritter, 2004;
Pollock & Rindova, 2003; Tiniç, 1988).
Our third dependent variable, total valuation
premium, was calculated as the difference between
a firm’s first-day stock closing price and its book
value prior to its IPO, multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding, all logged. This variable
captured the total change in stock value from the
time of the “road show” (see Martens [2004] for a
detailed explanation of IPO road shows) through
the end of the first day of market trading; investors
often refer to this value as “total valuation.” The
total valuation premium was not simply a linear
combination of the issue and retail market valuation premiums, however. For any given firm, there
may be a positive or negative trade-off between
these components of total valuation (Loughran &
Ritter, 2004). We therefore considered it prudent to
examine the total valuation premium in order to
assess the full impact of entrepreneurial narratives
on resource acquisition at IPO.
We recognize that finance scholars are generally
more interested in the change in a firm’s market
value as represented by price differentials for
shares—particularly underpricing (Loughran & Ritter, 2004; Tiniç, 1988). Although our variables incorporated price and share differentials simultaneously, we ran separate models for underpricing
and shares sold on the first day of trading. As
indicated in the supplementary table presented in
Appendix A, these variables were both sensitive to
entrepreneurial narratives, with underpricing being slightly more so. In addition, our supplemental
analyses showed that the pattern of narratives’ effects on underpricing was quite similar to that for
the total valuation premium. Nevertheless, given
that our central theoretical outcome of interest was
the resources acquired during the IPO process, and
not the increase in firm value, we thought it was
more appropriate to use various forms of net valuation, rather than underpricing, in the analyses reported below.
Independent Variables
Type of identity constructed for an entrepreneurial firm. All of the entrepreneurial narratives
were classified into one of the seven identity constructions presented in Table 2: (1) established
leader, (2) aspiring leader with track record, (3)
aspiring leader with logical plans, (4) aspiring
leader with social ties, (5) potential contender, (6)
potential noncontender, and (7) ambiguous identity. We then dummy-coded these categories, com-

October

bining the potential contender and the potential
noncontender categories as the omitted baseline in
the analyses. These omitted categories contained a
much smaller proportion of the narratives than the
others and seemed relatively less likely to attenuate
investor uncertainty and skepticism.
Degree of elaboration evident in the rationales
for intended initiatives. To calculate this measure,
we first transformed each firm’s story map into a
93 ⫻ 93 symmetric matrix. This matrix contained
values of either 1 or 0, depending on whether or not
a link existed between a particular risk-strategy
pair. Theoretically, each firm in any time period
could have experienced the 76 risks and most of the
17 strategies used in the study, because these risks
are well established through case law (MacCrimmon & Martens, 2001) and many of the strategies,
though not used routinely in each industry of interest here, were based on standard corporate or
business-level forms of strategy (Porter, 1980). Ignoring directionality (Bonacich & Lloyd, 2001), we
summed all links in the lower half of the matrix,
excluding the diagonal, to create an overall measure of the elaboration evident in the rationales
provided for an entrepreneurial firm’s intended initiatives. Similar measures have been used to capture the complexity of knowledge structures more
generally (Fransella & Bannister, 1977; Spender &
Eden, 1998).
Use of familiar and unfamiliar symbols from
broader contextual discourses. To code the degree
to which familiar contextual symbols were invoked
in an entrepreneurial narrative, we focused on the
intended strategic actions articulated in a firm’s
prospectus that other IPO firms in the same industry commonly mentioned (as discussed for Table
4). We then calculated an overall measure of familiarity (F) as follows:

冘 P for P ⬎ 0.50,

where P is the proportion of IPO firms in the same
industry that had mentioned the same strategy (s)

listed by more than 50 percent of the prior year’s
IPO firms in the industry.3 This cutoff point en-

In the case of the IPOs issued in the first year of our
study’s time frame (n ⫽ 15), for which the EDGAR database offered no prior IPO information from which to form
a baseline referent, we used the cases in the 12 months
after a focal IPO. The results obtained without these 15
cases included in the analyses were quite similar for

<-----Page 14----->2007

Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

sured that familiar strategies were articulated in the
majority of previous prospectuses circulated by
IPO firms in an industry; as such, the strategies
should have been recognizable to most readers.
Similarly, we calculated an overall measure of
unfamiliarity (U) as follows:

冘 (1 ⫺ P ) for P ⱕ 0.50,
n

Uf ⫽

s

s

(2)

s⫽1

where P once again represents the proportion of
IPO firms in the same industry that had listed the
same strategy, s, as focal firm f in their prospectuses
during the previous year. In the unfamiliarity measure, however, n is the number of strategies listed
by 50 percent or less of the prior year’s IPO firms in
that industry. Thus, unfamiliar strategies were
those articulated in the minority of previous prospectuses circulated by IPO firms in the industry;
as such, these strategies should have been less recognizable to readers.
IPO prospectuses from the year prior to a focal
firm’s initial filing date were the referent for both
measures because the familiarity and unfamiliarity
of any particular narrative are essentially temporal
(Barry & Elmes, 1997). That is, what is considered
unfamiliar one year may well be familiar by the
next. Moreover, investigations of the IPO process
have shown that when authors craft IPO prospectuses, they typically rely on several well-known
prospectuses that have recently circulated within a
given industry (Bhabra & Pettway, 2003; Martens,
2004).
Control Variables
Three temporal and two heterogeneity controls
were used in our analyses. First, we controlled for
the different founding periods of the entrepreneurial ventures using firm age. Firms with longer track
records are known to have a higher chance of IPO
success (Chang, 2004; Stuart et al., 1999). Second,
we controlled for hot IPO time period, which was
measured by the number of IPOs issued within the
same week as a focal firm’s (Jenkinson &
Ljungqvist, 2001). Third, we controlled for whether
an IPO was issued before or during the “dot.bomb
period” (Economist, 2000) which was coded 0 for
any IPO issued before March 31, 2000, and 1 otherwise (Ritter & Welch, 2002). In the case of heterogeneity, we controlled for the level of ex ante risk

most variables, if slightly weaker owing to reduction of
observations.

each firm appeared to face. This variable, a count of
ten risk factor categories, captured the essence of
firm-level risk (MacCrimmon & Martens, 2001;
Welbourne & Andrews, 1996). Given that industry
differences, even within the high-tech sector, are
known to influence IPO success (Certo, Covin,
Daily, & Dalton, 2001; Nelson, 2003; Stuart et al.,
1999), we also included dummy variables for industry, with the most stable and mature industry
(semiconductors) being the omitted category.
We also included a substantially different group
of controls to capture the main alternative theoretical explanations, those outside our narrative perspective on resource acquisition. Our controls for
the social tie approach included the average prestige of the underwriter group involved in an IPO,
calculated with Loughran and Ritter’s (2004) updated underwriter prestige measure, and the percentage of an IPO firm’s top management team that
was placed by venture capital firms (Higgins &
Gulati, 2006). Our controls for the quality signaling
approach included four commonly utilized variables capturing a firm’s existing stock of tangible
and intangible resources: (1) logged prior revenues
(in US$ millions), (2) total number of patents
owned and pending, (3) total years of top management team industry tenure, and (4) existence of
strategic alliances (e.g., Cohen & Dean, 2005; Das,
Sen, & Sengupta 1998; Pollock & Rindova, 2003).
To avoid potential common method bias, we took
the data for these control variables from sections of
the IPO prospectus that were not used for coding
the narratives, such as the financial tables and management team section.

Methods of Analysis
As have other researchers examining IPO proceeds and pricing (e.g., Cohen & Dean, 2005; Lester,
Certo, Dalton, Dalton, & Cannella, 2006; Tiniç,
1988), we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to assess the impact of the narrative constructs
net of the controls. Our main concern in using OLS
was with the autocorrelation that might exist in a
sector-based sample over four years (Greene, 1993).
Although we did not pool observations for the same
firm over time, there was likely to be some serial
correlation that could affect the residuals and error
terms, thus biasing our estimates. Without the inclusion of the temporal controls described above,
the Durbin-Watson values were sometimes in the
grey range, between 1.75 and 1.90. With the inclusion of the controls, the majority of the values

<-----Page 15----->1122

Academy of Management Journal

were between 1.90 and 2.05, indicating low
autocorrelation.4
Given the large number of resource-related variables in our analyses, a second concern was with
multicollinearity. The correlation matrix presented
in Appendix B indicates that the vast majority of
the correlations were below .40. Although the
squared elaboration term and the familiarity by unfamiliarity interaction terms are highly correlated
with their constituent variables, this form of multicollinearity only influences the efficiency of a
t-test (via inflated standard errors) and not the interpretation of the joint effects (Jaccard, Turrisi, &
Wan, 1990). Thus, we were confident that autocorrelation and multicollinearity were not problematic
for our analyses.

Results
The effects of identity constructions. The first
hypothesis derived from our qualitative findings is
that the identity constructed for a firm within an
entrepreneurial narrative has an influence on external resource providers that goes above and beyond
the influence of other means by which they could
obtain information about the firm’s existing resource stock. Table 5 contains our quantitative
findings. The first three models show the effects of
specific facts about a firm’s tangible and intangible
capital without the identity narratives included. As
predicted by the social tie and quality signaling
perspectives, several of these indicators exerted a
significant impact on a firm’s ability to acquire
additional capital. Moreover, the variance explained (R2) for each model is significantly different from that for the baseline model containing
only the temporal and heterogeneity controls. The
second three models show the effects of the various
identity constructions without the resource-related
factors. In keeping with a narrative approach to

We also computed the number of months that had
elapsed between 1996 and each IPO issue date, but the
inclusion of this variable did not affect the DurbinWatson statistic any more than our existing temporal
controls; hence, it was not used in the final analyses.

resource acquisition, several of these also exerted a
significant impact on a firm’s ability to obtain external capital. As revealed by the R2-values, each of
these models is also significantly different from the
baseline model of controls.
The final three models in Table 5 show the effects of the different identity narratives net of the
resource-related controls. Although the changes in
R2-values for these models are only marginally significant, several of the identity constructions continued to exert a significant impact on a firm’s
resource acquisition ability. Narratives that portrayed an entrepreneurial firm as an aspiring leader
with a track record had a positive impact on the
issue valuation premium. Conversely, narratives
that portrayed an entrepreneurial firm as an aspiring leader with social ties had a negative impact on
the total valuation premium. Interestingly, the
strongest effects were for the ambiguous identity
narratives, which, counter to existing research on
organizational ambiguity (e.g., Eisenberg, 1984), exerted a negative effect on two of the three resource
acquisition measures.
In sum, then, as predicted by Hypothesis 1, we
found some evidence that the identity conveyed for
an entrepreneurial firm within a narrative format
does influence external resource providers above
and beyond more purely factual information about
the firm’s resource stock. We note, however, that
this was not the case for narratives portraying an
entrepreneurial firm as an established leader,
which had exerted positive effects without the resource-related controls. Similarly, we note that the
positive impact of narratives portraying an entrepreneurial firm as an aspiring leader with a track
record also decreased in strength when the resource-related controls were entered into the models. Supporting Lounsbury and Glynn’s speculation, these two entrepreneurial stories in particular
do not appear to be completely “independent from
the stock of capital to which an entrepreneur has
access” (2001: 561).
The effects of elaborating the rationales behind intended initiatives. According to the second
hypothesis derived from our qualitative findings,
returns to elaborate justifications of a firm’s proposed means of exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities would be positive, but diminishing. Table
6 contains our quantitative results. The first three
models report the findings when a linear term for
elaboration was added to the full models from the
previous table. This variable exerted a positive and
significant effect on two of the three resource acquisition measures: issue and total valuation
premiums.
To test the notion of diminishing returns, we

1123

then added a squared elaboration term to each
model. Because of the table’s size, we do not report
all three columns of estimates. The squared term
was negative and statistically significant (at p ⱕ
.05) in one of the models—that for total valuation
premium— but not in the other two models. Thus,
we found only marginal support for the argument
about diminishing returns. Overall, then, Hypothesis 2 was partially supported. Although increasingly elaborate justifications of proposed entrepreneurial initiatives appear to facilitate the
acquisition of externally provided resources,
highly complex rationales sometimes hinder a
firm’s ability to influence potential investors.
The effects of embedding contextually familiar
and unfamiliar symbols. The third hypothesis derived from our qualitative findings was that entrepreneurial narratives that embed contextually familiar and contextually unfamiliar elements within
them will be more effective as a resource acquisition tool, but that such narratives will also experience diminishing effectiveness beyond a certain
point. Our initial step for exploring this hypothesis
involved examining the main effects of familiarity
and unfamiliarity. As reported in models 4 through
6 of Table 6, we found that familiarity exerted a
significant and positive impact on two of the three
dependent variables (issue and total valuation premiums). Unfamiliarity exerted a positive effect on
issue premiums, but not on the other two forms of
resource acquisition. In unreported models in
which each variable was entered separately, we
found the same pattern of positive effects for familiarity but nonsignificant effects for unfamiliarity.
These findings support the argument that familiar
elements provide an essential contextual grounding for the successful inclusion of unfamiliar elements; in other words, effective entrepreneurial
narratives “[place] stories about the exotic in a familiar context” (Smith & Anderson, 2004: 130).
To examine the notion of diminishing returns for
very large numbers of familiar and unfamiliar elements, we added a familiarity by unfamiliarity interaction term, as reported in models 7 through 9 of
Table 6. Although this term is negative in all three
models, the coefficients were not significant. Thus,
we did not find statistically defensible support for
the argument that narratives containing high levels
of both familiar and unfamiliar elements might lead
some prospective investors to evaluate an entrepreneurial firm negatively, thereby decreasing their
willingness to commit investment capital. Overall,
then, Hypothesis 3 was only partially supported.
Relative effect sizes and substantive importance of the narrative constructs. Combined, the
preceding analyses demonstrate that certain as-

pects of entrepreneurial narratives are statistically
significant predictors of resource acquisition
among IPO firms. But what is the relative and substantive importance of these variables? In the interests of both clarity and brevity, we address this
question by focusing on the final models for issue
and total valuation premiums reported in Table 6.
When we calculated the standardized coefficients
for the statistically significant predictors in these
models, we discovered that none of the beta
weights for the narrative constructs were as high as
those for lead underwriter prestige, which was the
most significant of our controls for alternative theoretical explanations.5 However, when we assessed

their substantive impact, by calculating the effects
of a one-unit increase in each variable, we discovered that our focal narrative constructs exerted effects similar to that for lead underwriter prestige. In
the case of issue valuation premiums, the substantive impact of the statistically significant narrative
constructs ranged from $1.01M to $1.50M (versus
$1.19M for underwriter prestige); in the case of
total valuation premiums, the absolute values
ranged from $0.58M to $1.59M (versus $1.41M for
underwriter prestige). These clearly represent very
large dollar values in absolute terms.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
5
The beta weights for lead underwriter prestige were
.38 and .47 in the models for issue and total valuation
premiums, respectively, whereas the absolute values of
the beta weights for the statistically significant narrative
constructs ranged from .14 to .31.

Integrating work on the resource acquisition process with narrative theory and research, we examined the belief that successful entrepreneurs are
effective storytellers (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; O’Connor, 2004; Porac et al.,

<-----Page 18----->2007

Martens, Jennings, and Jennings

2002; Smith & Anderson, 2004). Our findings support this view, revealing that effectively constructed stories do help entrepreneurs acquire the
money they need to exploit identified opportunities. More specifically, our results suggest that particularly influential narratives: (1) construct unambiguous identities for entrepreneurial firms, (2)
elaborate how the proposed means of exploitation
will attenuate risk (without providing overly complex explanations), and (3) invoke familiar elements to contextually ground those that are less
familiar. Moreover, we found that narratives constructed in this manner influence resource providers in a way that goes above and beyond the effects
of more purely factual information about a firm’s
resource endowments. Our findings thus support
the underlying premise that storytelling is a key
mechanism through which entrepreneurs can leverage their existing capital to acquire additional
resources.
Our spin on the linguistic turn in entrepreneurship research offers a number of important insights
to the field. First, by borrowing concepts from narrative theory and research, we extend theory about
the resource acquisition process to illuminate how
a firm’s extant resource stocks can be leveraged to
attract more capital. Second, we offer rich qualitative data that illustrate how entrepreneurial narratives are constructed in practice, as well as robust
quantitative data that demonstrate how such stories
can make a difference that goes above and beyond
the factors emphasized in existing resource acquisition research. Third, we created several measures
that may help future researchers capture the nature
and effects of both the interpretative and structural
features of entrepreneurial narratives. We thus
view our study as contributing to the broader work
on cultural entrepreneurship (e.g., Aldrich & Fiol,
1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001; Pollock & Rindova, 2003) in which successful entrepreneurs are
viewed as “skilled users of cultural tool kits” (Rao,
1994: 41).
Our empirical findings, however, point to a more
complex relationship between entrepreneurial narratives, resource stocks, and resource acquisition
than has been previously thought to exist. For example, although we found that narratives about an
entrepreneurial firm’s identity tended to encode
information about its extant resources within them,
as suggested by Lounsbury and Glynn (2001), we
did not find complete correspondence between a
firm’s objective resource level and its socially construed identity: those with the lowest and highest
resource factor scores were not invariably portrayed as potential contenders and established
leaders, respectively. It thus appears that the au-

1125

thors of entrepreneurial narratives have at least
some freedom to “re-present” the facts. It also appears that certain identity constructions, in turn,
influence resource acquisition more than others.
We found that established leader identities, in particular, no longer exerted effects after we controlled
for objective data on a firm’s existing capital. It
seems that this type of identity acted more as a
substitute for, rather than a supplement to, other
ways of conveying information about a firm’s existing resource stock. The implication is that stories
emphasizing a venture’s track record, connections,
and/or other signals of its credibility may not always be more influential—an interpretation that
seems counter to one of Lounsbury and Glynn’s
(2001) key propositions about entrepreneurial storytelling. Similarly, we did not find much evidence
of a diminishing effect for story elaboration or contextual familiarity and unfamiliarity. Instead, the
primarily positive and linear effects that we found
for these variables seem to contradict the presumed
importance of simplifying the complex in entrepreneurial accounts (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Smith &
Anderson, 2004).
Limitations
The mixed-methodology approach that we
adopted in this study increases our confidence in
the inferences that can drawn from its findings
(Lee, 1999), yet certain limitations suggest that we
should portray the above interpretations as provocative insights rather than as conclusive claims.
Some may question, for instance, whether the IPO
prospectuses contained complete stories of the sort
typically studied by narrative theorists. We agree,
but would counter that they are certainly much
more developed than the “minimal narratives”
identified by Czarniawska (1998: 17). We also note
that other researchers have recently used IPO prospectuses as a data source for examining the stories
disseminated by entrepreneurs (e.g., Santos &
Eisenhardt, 2004).
Our focus on IPO firms may also bring into question the generalizability of our findings. We agree
that our sample makes our findings most applicable
to this form of resource acquisition, but we believe
that our research design increases the generalizability of our results. For instance, we selected industries that were established (semiconductors), growing (biotechnology), and emerging (Internet content
providers). We also selected both stable and volatile periods in the stock and IPO markets. Moreover, as Lounsbury and Glynn advised, we were
“cautious of the potential correlation between observed stories and entrepreneurial resources”

<-----Page 19----->1126

Academy of Management Journal

(2001: 560), and obtained measures of a firm’s existing capital stock from nonnarrative sections of its
IPO prospectus. Finally, to capture the amount of
capital raised at various points in the IPO process,
we used multiple dependent variables. All of these
design decisions help establish the robustness of
our findings and their generalizability to similar
forms of resource acquisition, such as the processes
involved in obtaining capital from venture capitalists and other financial institutions.
From an entrepreneurship theory perspective,
less information asymmetry and uncertainty is
likely to exist about IPO firms than about de novo
start-ups, thereby potentially attenuating the effect
of entrepreneurial storytelling at this stage of resource acquisition. Some IPO firms are already very
well known before going public, especially those
that are well established. Thus, potential investors
may be able to easily find a lot of credible information about these firms from many other sources,
thereby reducing the impact of the stories told in
their IPO prospectuses. This reasoning may help
explain why established-leader identities did not
exert a net effect on IPO valuations in our analyses.
Information asymmetry and uncertainty, however,
are unlikely to be completely absent in the case of
IPO firms. By definition, such firms will be managed for the very first time as publicly rather than
privately owned organizations. Moreover, many
will operate on a much larger scale—and often
under different top management—than they did
prior to going public. This situation may help explain why several of the other narrative constructs
did exert net effects on IPO valuation premiums. In
sum, although we recognize that the issuance of an
IPO represents a unique form of resource acquisition (Shane, 2003), we nevertheless expect that
many of our findings will hold during earlier stages
in the process.
In addition to questioning our focus on the IPO
stage of resource acquisition, some may question
the conceptualization and operationalization of our
narrative constructs. We focused on concepts that
not only have been espoused in the narrative literature, but also were most apparent to us in the
prospectuses themselves: identity constructions,
story elaboration, and the incorporation of contextually familiar and unfamiliar elements. Other narrative devices, such as analogies, metaphors, and
genres (Barry & Elmes, 1997), may be more salient
and influential in other forms of entrepreneurial
storytelling—an intriguing question worthy of future research. The measurement of our focal constructs may also appear rather unequal, or asymmetric, to some readers. For instance, we
developed a typology to characterize the different

October

stories told about the IPO firms’ identities, but we
only characterized the stories told about their strategic initiatives according to their degrees of elaboration, familiarity, and unfamiliarity. We believe
there is room for other studies with typologies characterizing the various stories told about firms’ proposed initiatives, perhaps typologies that capture
differences in the quality of intended strategic actions. Alternatively, it may be useful for future researchers to create a single scale for identity constructions, perhaps one measuring the degree of
congruence between a firm’s actual resource stock
and its socially construed identity.
Future Directions
With respect to future research, we can envision
a host of other intriguing directions for further
work adopting a narrative approach to entrepreneurial phenomena. One of the most obvious is
triggered by the dot.com scandals (Lowenstein,
2004): the need to investigate the nature, prevalence, and effects of inauthentic entrepreneurial
narratives. Narrative theorists believe that stories
often represent “poetic elaborations on facts” that
allow a storyteller “to exaggerate, to omit, to draw
connections where none are apparent [and] to silence events that interfere with the storyline” (Gabriel, 2004: 75). To what extent do entrepreneurs
engage in these and other forms of poetic elaboration when telling stories about their endeavors? Do
recipients accept inauthentic narratives “as prerogatives of poetic license” or deem them to be “misrepresentations, untruths and lies” (Gabriel, 2004:
75)? And even if investors do not wholly believe
certain narratives, does that prevent them from
committing capital— or do they suspend their disbelief in the hope that the story will come true?
Implicit in the above discussion is the notion that
entrepreneurs and capital providers are equally important in the resource acquisition process. Focusing on the role of the entrepreneur, it would be
interesting to examine the additive and interactive
effects of both the content and the source of entrepreneurial narratives, as has recent work on the
psychology of persuasion (e.g., Rucker & Petty,
2006). We suspect that in certain situations, especially face-to-face interactions, qualities of the entrepreneurial storytellers themselves, such as their
demographic characteristics and/or social skills
(Baron & Markman, 2000, 2003), might be just as
influential as the stories they tell, or maybe even
more influential. Testing Lounsbury and Glynn’s
(2001) argument that storytelling may be particularly critical for entrepreneurs heading firms with
lower resource endowments represents another in-

<-----Page 20----->2007

teresting and important next step. A related line of
inquiry would be to investigate whether those
heading firms with certain resource levels possess
more or less latitude for storytelling—for example,
whether the entrepreneurs in resource-scarce versus resource-rich firms vary in their ability to tell
stories.
Turning to the providers of resource capital, we
note that it would be worthwhile to investigate
when, why, and how entrepreneurial narratives
produce different outcomes depending upon the
audiences to which the stories are being told. Our
quantitative analysis revealed that the effects of our
narrative constructs differed somewhat over our
measures of resource acquisition. These outcome
measures reflected a firm’s value as perceived by
different groups of potential capital providers, notably institutional versus retail market investors.
Other recipients of entrepreneurial stories—such as
prospective employees, suppliers, and customers—
might also respond differently to different narrative
constructs. Work on the psychology of persuasion,
particularly in the heuristic-systematic and elaboration likelihood models (e.g., Chaiken, 1980; Chen
& Chaiken, 1999; Petty & Wegener, 1999) will likely
prove useful in theory development for this line of
inquiry.
The context surrounding the stories entrepreneurs tell resource providers also needs to be incorporated more systematically into future theorizing and empirical research. The work of Boje (1995:
1018) and Czarniawska and Joerges (1996: 46) suggests that entrepreneurial stories do not travel well
across different cultural contexts without substantial modification. Lounsbury and Glynn (2001)
noted that entrepreneurial storytelling matters
more in certain institutional environments than in
others. We wonder about the content of the stories
that are told about entrepreneurs in different settings. Are entrepreneurs glorified in some regions
yet portrayed in less flattering terms in others and,
if so, can this distinction help explain the regional
variation evident in the prevalence of entrepreneurship? Addressing questions like these will
help establish the contextual boundaries of a narrative approach to entrepreneurship research.
Our final suggestion for furthering such an approach is to emphasize the importance of supplementing rich case studies of the stories told by and
about entrepreneurs, such as those conducted by
Foss (2004) and O’Connor (2004), with rigorous
quantitative studies capable of systematically testing the effects of entrepreneurial storytelling. Researchers can accomplish this dual purpose by examining the provocative insights first gleaned
through qualitative work in later quantitative stud-

1127

ies. Or a single (but complex) mixed-methodology
study, such as the one we have presented here, can
be used. Regardless of the route adopted, it is only
by supplementing qualitative work with quantitative analyses that narrative researchers will best be
able to demonstrate that entrepreneurial storytelling is not “mere rhetoric” but is, instead, a practice
that plays a “substantial role in organizational outcomes” (Suddaby & Greenwood, 2005: 62).
