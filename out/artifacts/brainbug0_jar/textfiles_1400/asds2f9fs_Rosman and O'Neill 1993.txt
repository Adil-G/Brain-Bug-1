in new ventures prefer using internal

sources of capital as much as possible because they are uncertain about

how to obtain external financing and how the involvement of others will
impact their ventures. Because undercapitalization andjinancial problems
are at the center of nearly all business failures, it would appear useful for
owners and Jinancial planners to reduce the uncertainty surrounding
external financing. Obtaining information about one source of this uncertainty, a lack of understanding
of the decision processes followed by venture capitalists, is the focus of research in this paper and a
growing body of literature.
To further this line of study, we investigate the differences in decision behavior of venture
capitalists, using bankers as a benchmark for comparison in cases in which debt and debt-related
financing are sought. To the extent that venture capitalists have unique decision processes, owners and
financial planners might improve their ability to obtain financing through knowledge of the unique
features of venture capitalists’ decision processes. In addition, venture capitalists might improve their
decision effectiveness if made aware of systemic biases in their decision procedures.
Using a computer softiare package to trace information acquisition processes, we found that
venture capitalists acquired less information and followed a pattern of acquisition that was deeper
within categories of information than bankers. In addition, venture capitalists showed a stronger
preference for strategic data and less interest in historical financial data. Both groups minimized the use
offinancial forecasts and followed decision processes persistently across different types of companies
(start-up and well-established).

The implications of this study for practice are two-fold. First, if the owners or financial planners of
a new or relatively new venture are seeking financing from external sources, they should package the
business plan and request in a manner that is consistent with the source of financing. For example,
requests from venture capitalists should highlight strategic information, such as descriptions of the
product or process, patentability prospects, product market, and management team. Less emphasis
should be placed on financial information, particularly jinancial projections. In contrast, requests for
financing by banks should highlight historical financial information. Such differences between venture
and bankfinancing may lead individuals who are seeking financing to conclude that because historical
fmancial information is of primary importance to bankers, bank financing should be sought after the
business has developed a positive financial history and trend. This would confirm intuition and research
findings that venture financing is the primary source of external financing in the early stages of a new
venture.
Second, bankers and venture capitalists, like all decision-makers who have developed a degree of
expertise in a particular speciahy,should attempt to gain some insight into their decision processes. The
goal of obtaining this information would be to provide feedback on processes, such as information
acquisition, which tend to become automatic over time. With this knowledge, bankers and venture
capitalists could examine any biases in their behavior with the ultimate goal of improving performance.
This paper also has important implications for researchers. In particular, we have demonstrated
that computer-based
approaches for studying decision behavior offer promise for interesting
explorations into important issues such as how venture capitalists make decisions. The computer
minimizes researcher intrusion in the decision task and permits the collection of process data from
samples large enough to permit statistical analyses. In addition, the subjects determine the length of the
task and the direction of the search much as they would in practice, which increases the external
validity of the research method.

INTRODUCTION
One line of research on new business formation and financing that is receiving increased
attention in the literature is the examination of characteristics that underlie the decisionmaking processes of venture capitalists. This research is intended to provide venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs
with insight into how the former decide whether or not to
provide capital to the latter. Early studies used surveys and questionnaires to help researchers
make inferences
about the characteristics
of decision processes followed by venture
capitalists, such as the stages of decision-making
and the types of information used at each
stage (e.g., Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan,
Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha
1985;
MacMillan,
Zemann, and SubbaNarasimha
1987). With an emphasis on more direct
observation, recent studies have used techniques such as verbal protocol analysis to study
venture capitalists’
acquisition,
evaluation,
and integration
processes (e.g., Sandberg,
Schweiger, and Hofer 1988; Hall forthcoming).
In the present study, we propose that additional insight into the decision behavior of
venture capitalists can be achieved by modifying extant research designs in two ways. First,
we study venture capitalists in their loan-making
capacity in comparison
to bankers
(commercial lenders), both of whom are required to make similar judgments about the
financial stability of prospective borrowers. I By using a comparative approach, we study
whether or not there are unique characteristics of decision behavior associated with venture

‘Whereas venture capitalists are traditionally associated with equity investments, many do provide capital in
the form of debt financing as a way of reducing the risk associated with their portfolio of investments (Cooper and
Carleton 1979; Gladstone
1982; Golder 1992). For example, “mezzanine”
fmancing, which is a form of
subordinated debt that carries stipulated interest and principal payments, is commonly used to provide a venture
capitalist with the ability to select to “cash out” if necessary or to commit to an equity interest (Owens 1990; Remey

capitalists, rather than a general approach common to providers of debt and debt-related
capital. Determining whether or not venture capitalists and commercial lenders follow similar
or different decision processes is important to the lending community
because many
institutions that have typically dealt only with mature businesses, such as banks and financial
service operations, now provide significant amounts of capital to start-up businesses.
Differences in process may suggest that commercial lending institutions will not be as
successful in selecting new ventures as are typical venture capital operations. Furthermore, it
would suggest that en~epreneu~
should be sensitive to these differences when seeking funds
from banks or venture capitalists in order to have a better chance of obtaining the desired
financing (e.g., whether to provide venture capitalists or bankers with business plans that
emphasize strategic, rather than financial, information).
Second, we use a computer process-tracing technique that differs from verbal protocol
analysis, which is a commonly used method for directly studying the processes followed by
decision-makers,
such as bankers (e.g., Biggs et al. 1985) and venture capitalists (e.g.,
Sandberg et al. 1988). Computer search enables researchers to collect and analyze data from
a larger sample of subjects because it is less labor intensive than verbal protocol analysis. In
addition, computer search avoids the subjectivity that sometimes enters into coding verbal
protocols (Biggs, Rosman, and Sergenian forthcoming).
Finally, with respect to the
information acquisition component of decision-making,
computer search provides a more
complete trace of data than concurrent verbal protocols (Biggs et al. forthcoming).
The remainder of the study is presented in three parts. First, we review relevant literature.
Second, we present hypotheses and describe the analysis. Finally, we present the results and
discuss their implications for both researchers and practitioners.

LITERATURE

REVIEW

Loan decisions of venture capitalists and commercial lenders have been studied separately.
For example, Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) surveyed venture capitalists and found that they base
their decisions on market attractiveness, product differentiation, and managerial capabilities.
Sandberg and Hofer (1987), based on a literature review and interviews with venture
capitalists, simil~ly found that venture capitalists base decisions on industry structure and
firm strategy. Buttner and Rosen (1989) used simulated applications to study potential bias in
commercial bank lending processes. Rodgers (1991) used decision modeling to analyze the
impact of perceptual biases in commercial lending.
Each of these studies examines the outcomes of decisions (approval or disapproval), and
attempts to relate the outcome to specific characteristics
of either the decision-maker
(Rodgers 1991), the loan applicant (Buttner and Rosen 1989), or the venture seeking funding
(Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; Sandberg and Hofer 1987; Roure and Keeley 1990). These studies,
however, do not directly investigate how lenders process information. Rather, the researchers
draw inferences about process by observing the relationship between performance and the
characteristics
of the funded firms. These studies do not directly compare the decision
processes used by venture capitalists with other resource providers, such as commercial
lenders, to determine whether or not the characteristics of their decision processes are unique.

H. M. O’NEILL

One research team has separately studied venture capitalists (Hisrich and Jankowicz
1990) and commercial lenders (Jankowicz and Hisrich 1987), and inferred that venture
capitalists use fewer criteria than commercial lenders to make decisions. In contrast, we
directly investigate and compare how venture capitalists and commercial lenders (lending to
either new or mature businesses) acquire information for use in decision-making.2
Commercial lenders and venture capitalists are experts at addressing problems that arise
in business financing situations. Their expertise, however, differs in one important regard.
Commercial lenders are experts about mature (well-established)
companies, the majority of
which are viable going concerns, whereas venture capitalists are experts about start-ups, many
of which typically are not viable businesses. Thus, each type of lender has experience relevant
to either the specific problem of lending to mature (the commercial lender) or start-up
businesses (the venture capitalist).
Loan decisions present lenders with a complex problem. According to Simon’s model of
decision-making
(1991), complex problems fail to provide the decision-maker
with a unique
link among stimuli, cues, information chunks, and decisions. A stimulus can prompt several
cues; the cues can prompt several information sets; the information can prompt several
decisions. To identify appropriate behavior, the decision-maker
searches for more stimuli,
cues, and information
sets to be able to generalize from similar relationships,
which
ultimately builds confidence in the resulting decision. This model is consistent with the
limited capacity notion expressed by many who have studied human information processing
(e.g., Lord and Maher 1990). Experts are characterized by a high ratio of information content
relevant to a specific set of problems within their domain of specialization. No one is expert
at all problems, though many individuals are expert at some. To the extent that expertise
varies across commercial
lenders and venture capitalists, their information
acquisition
strategies should differ to accommodate the special characteristics unique to each domain.
That is, if venture capitalists and commercial lenders have different experience, then the skill
and knowledge associated with their expertise should differ. Consequently, venture capitalists
and commercial lenders should evidence different information acquisition strategies, even
when faced with the same type of decision.

Background

Experience and Decision Behavior

Theoretical and empirical work suggest that shared background experiences foster similarities
in decision behavior. For example, managers who share functional backgrounds demonstrate
strong preferences for the same strategies (Dearborn and Simon 1958; Hambrick and Mason
1984). In contrast, managers who vary by background show a variety of strategic preferences.
In a like fashion, mid-level managers respond differently than executive level managers to the
same set of stimuli (Ireland et al. 1984). Similar differences have been found between
physicians (Joseph and Pate1 1990) and auditors (Bedard and Biggs 1991).
The differences between managers from varied functional backgrounds or dissimilar
hierarchical ranks are easily observed, and perhaps obvious. The differences between
commercial lenders and venture capitalists are less obvious, given the similarities in their

decision-making
has the potential to influence other stages (Einhom and Hogarth 1981). Second, computer search
provides a relatively unambiguous trace of information acquisition that is complete with respect to information from
external sources. In contrast, other methods of process tracing, such as verbal protocols, may introduce researcher
subjectivity and do not provide a complete trace of process (Biggs et al. forthcoming).

requisite tasks. However, there are at least four dimensions on which their experiences differ:
and
“information reliability, ” “orientation towards past and future,” “service multiplicity,”
“degree of documentation.”
Each is addressed in turn in the remainder of this section to
provide a basis for developing hypotheses about differences in information
acquisition
strategies between venture capitalists and bankers in making lending judgments.3
Information reliability refers to the quality of information available to lenders. Although
both commercial and venture lenders make judgments about a firm’s future prospects, they
base their conclusions on different informational signals. For commercial lenders, financial
information generally is readily available and reliable. Thus, these lenders focus on financial
ratios, flow of funds analysis, and bankruptcy model scores as they make decisions (Altman
1985; Cohen, Gilmore, and Singer 1966; Foster 1986). In contrast, venture capital lenders
complete their tasks without readily available or reliable financial information.
As a
consequence, venture capital lenders make decisions based on strategic information such as
market attractiveness,
product differentiation,
and managerial capabilities
(Tyebjee and
Bruno 1984). Said more colloquially, commercial lenders put their faith in the financials
whereas venture capitalists put their faith in the size of the problem, the elegance of the
solution, and the mettle of the entrepreneur.
Orientation towards past and future, a concept related to information reliability, refers to
the time perspective adopted by lenders as they evaluate loan applicants. Venture capital
lenders build their experience assessing companies that have limited historical track records.
Thus, venture capitalists make judgments based on forecasts of future events, or based on
present conditions that portend future states. In contrast, commercial lenders most often build
their experience assessing established companies. Commercial lenders, then, make judgments
based on historical events.
Service multiplicity
refers to the ancillary services that may be linked to loans.
Commercial lenders typically offer a portfolio of income-generating
services, of which one is
the loan. These ancillary services include leasing analysis, insurance advice, letters of credit,
security guarantees, cash management, and investment banking (Cohen et al. 1966). In contrast,
the product relationships between a particular venture capitalist and entrepreneur typically
involve fewer products. Whereas the personal relationships that may grow between venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs are more intensive than those between bankers and their clients,
there typically is less linkage of a current project with future or concurrent activities for the
former. In short, whereas the lending decision for the commercial lender may be contingent on
other activities with the client, the venturer’s decision relies only on the proposed project at
hand. Thus, the commercial lender (venture capitalist) has high (low) service multiplicity.
Finally, degree of documentation
is a measure of the regulatory scope faced by each
lender type. The commercial lender faces external and internal review. Both forms of review

3Although venture capital often is associated with investment (equity) financing, venture capital also is a major
source of loan financing provided by independent private venture capital companies, small business investment
companies (SBICs), and venture capital subsidiaries of large financial institutions or industrial companies (Pratt
1992). Of the $5.8 billion of venture capital provided in 1981, approximately
45% was from private venture
capitalists and the remaining 55% was split almost evenly between SBlCs and venture capital subsidiaries (Pratt
1982). SBICs that are owned by banks are extensions of the loan department and may handle loans that may not
qualify for traditional bank financing. A bank, therefore, can invest in ventures through convertible loans without
risking more than its initial capital infusion, handle the business accounts of the new customer, and expand its own
product line (Chase and Every 1985). Non-SBIC venturers may invest in preferred stocks that have more features of
loans than of investments. Loan financing is one way to reduce economic risk because it allows the venturer to get
a return on investment in the form of interest rather than as capita1 appreciation (Cooper and Carleton 1979; Golder
1992).

<-----Page 5----->448

require substantial documentation.
In contrast, the venture capitalist generally faces only a
low degree of documentation. The venture industry is less regulated, and venture firms tend
to be smaller and less formal than commercial lending firms.
The lending environments
in which commercial and venture capital lenders operate
differ across each of these four dimensions. As lenders gain experience in a domain that is
associated with a particular type of lending task, it becomes the domain at which they are
expert. In terms of Simon’s model, the lender acquires a high level of information content
relative to solving problems presented by loans in a particular domain. Lenders whose
experience is contingent on a particular domain (i.e., mature vs. start-up company) may value
information differently as a function of prior experience. The same cue or stimulus, a loan
request, may prompt a different decision process by each type of lender. In short, different
lenders are expected to have different information acquisition strategies. With respect to loan
approval decisions, the salience of information will vary by lender type.
In sum, two broad categories of information accessed during investment evaluations
include financial and strategic information (management, firm strategy, and the environment).
Given their different professional experiences, commercial leaders and venture lenders are
expected to acquire information differently, consistent with Simon’s model.

HYPOTHESES

AND PROPOSED

ANALYSIS

Hypotheses are presented for three types of information and three measures of information
acquisition activity. The types of information mirror the types of information found salient in
the aforementioned
studies. Information about management, product differentiation,
market
attractiveness and business environment
are defined in this study as strategic information.
Information
about financial status and trends is separated into historical and projected
categories because of the focus by lenders on the dimension of orientation towards past and
future. In sum, the three types of information are strategic, historical financial, and projected
financial. The specific data points present in each type of information are listed in Table 1.
The three measures of information
acquisition
activity are: scope of information
acquisition, depth of information acquisition, and total information. Scope of information is
a measure of the specific categories of data points (e.g., projected liquidity) acquired during
an information search, regardless of the number of data points within each category that are
acquired. Depth of information is a measure of the proportion of data points acquired within
each information type (projected, financial, and strategic).4 Total information is a measure of
information acquisition across all data points, regardless of information category and type.
The first two hypotheses are based on the differences that emerge across the two types
of lenders based on their different experience with respect to information reliability and
orientation towards past and future. Venture capital lenders lack reliable historical financial
data. Furthermore, whatever exists probably is not indicative of future performance. Thus,
they tend to rely on strategic information. In contrast, commercial lenders operate in an
environment that is rich with respect to past financial data, which are expected to be related
to future trends. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis:
Hl (Scope): Venture capital lenders (VCs) will acquire information from fewer historical

4Because it is based on the proportion of information acquired, depth of information is intended to capture the
relative importance of information to each lender type. Therefore, expectations for depth of information do not
necessarily correspond to the scope or amount of information acquired.

and projected financial categories than commercial

lenders (CLs). VCs will acquire more

information from strategic categories than CLs.
Because venture capitalists typically lack reliable historical financial data, they tend to be
future-oriented.
Thus, information (financial and strategic) that forecasts future events is
expected to be more salient to venture capitalists than it is to commercial lenders. Thus, we
expect the following relationship to hold:
H2 (Depth): VCs will acquire proportionately
information

and proportionately

more projected financial and strategic
less historical financial information than CLs.

The third hypothesis is based on differences in multiplicity
of service and degree of
documentation across the lender types. Commercial lenders seek to sell services, prompting
them to acquire information that may help them identify and justify the sale of such services.

<-----Page 7----->450

A. J. ROSMAN AND H. M. O’NEILL

Commercial lenders also work in formal organizations that require justification for decisions.
Multiplicity
of services and required degree of documentation
combine to suggest that
commercial lenders engage in a more far-reaching information acquisition strategy compared
to venture capital lenders. The extent of the total information acquisition may manifest itself
in the amount of information acquired, the time spent acquiring information, and the pattern
of acquisition.
While it would seem intuitive that amount and time would be positively correlated,
Biggs et al. (forthcoming) find that although time associated with information acquisition
differed across treatments, amount of information acquired did not. Thus, reasons other than
intuition must be found to predict effects for time. Prior research finds that venture capitalists
tend to be very efficient in the use of their time (Hall forthcoming). Perhaps their efficiency
results from the need to evaluate a high volume of business plans every year or because they
are very focused (i.e., they have the very specific task of judging the quality of the project,
rather than the quality of a portfolio of potential services). Regardless of the reason for their
efficiency, venture capital leaders are expected to acquire fewer pieces of information overall,
to spend less time on the task, and to acquire information with less effort5
H3 (Total Information, Time, and Pattern): VCs will acquire less information overall
than CLs, spend less time on the task, and expend less effort in information
acquisition.
The final hypothesis provides an opportunity to investigate the persistence of information
acquisition strategies across problem types. Information acquisition strategies are products of
experience. As experience accumulates over time, the influence of that experience should not
vary widely across similar situations. In other words, when lenders face a number of problems
that are similar in terms of the four dimensions of interest described earlier (information
reliability, orientation towards past and future, degree of documentation,
and multiplicity of
services), their information
acquisition
strategies are expected to be consistent. When
confronted with new situations, these strategies also are expected to persist, even if the
characteristics of the situations vary on important dimensions, because the lenders will try to
apply the rich repertoire of strategies developed in their familiar domain to novel domains.
Such persistence is consistent with findings in a significant body of research that has
addressed problems of selective perception (Dearborn and Simon 1958), perceptual screens
(Cyert and March 1963), tunnel vision (Mason and Mitroff 1981), functional fixedness (Katz
1982), and strategic myopia (Lorsch 1985). The persistence of decision processes across
familiar and new settings is a subject of inquiry among decision theorists, who are interested
in the relationship between persistence and effectiveness in different types of tasks (Rosman
1988; Rosman, Lubatkin, and O’Neill 1992). Here, our interest is solely on documenting
whether or not persistence exists, as the mere presence of persistence in information
acquisition will have direct consequences for the entrepreneur. For example, if a venture
capitalist prefers a particular format for the business plan, creativity in presentation may not
be advisable because the novel business plan would be more difficult for the venture capitalist
to evaluate.

% is generally agreed that processing by attribute (intradimensionally)
requires less effort than processing by
alternative (interdimensionally)
because. the former is a comparison of information
having the same unit of
measurement whereas the latter is a comparison of information that is likely to have different units of measurement
(Tversky 1969; Bettman 1979; Russo and Dosher 1983; Rosman and Bedard 1992). Intradimensional
processing in
this study would lx evident in acquisition that is more concentrated within categories, such as liquidity, than across
categories.

H4 (Persistence): For both VCs and CLs, the pattern of information acquisition will
persist across problems, even though the characteristics of the problem might vary.

EXPERIMENT

Subjects
Nineteen venture capital lenders (VCs) and 23 commercial lenders (CLs) participated in the
study, They completed the experiment in their offices in major cities across three states. The
lender groups were not statistically different in years of experience (VC: 5.9, CL: 7.9). Thus,
the participants had sufficient experience to develop fixed information acquisition patterns
within their task domains. A similar proportion of each group had business degrees (VC:
89.5%, CL: 91.3%).
The groups, however, were different in key respects, which confirms the intended
experimental manipulation. Venture capital lenders had more prior business experience than
commercial lenders. In addition, venture capita1 lenders typically dealt with: (1) younger
businesses (VC: 3 years old, CL: 16.3 years old), (2) fewer secured loans (VC: 25.8%, CL:
63.5%), (3) more high-technology
clients (VC: 32.6%, CL: 10.2%). and (4) loan portfolios
concentrated less on short-term loans and lines of credit and more on loans greater than five
years and convertible debt.6 Each of these differences, statistically significant at the 1% level,
offer specific evidence that the task domains of the two types of lenders were different.

Method and Task
Subjects interacted with a computer to select information they deemed relevant to making
separate judgments about four prospective loan candidates. They were instructed to select any
amount of information, in any order they deemed appropriate, for the purpose of deciding
whether or not to recommend for approval the amount requested by each prospective
borrower.
Computer search process-tracing techniques generally provide a sequential trace of data
requested by subjects and a record of the time expended on each cue. The software used in this
study, “Search Monitor,” uses a menu-driven format (i.e., menus are linked through a logical
decision-tree network). Menus displayed on the screen list available categories or dimensions
of information from which cues are selected (Brucks 1988). For example, a menu may include
the names of information cues (“projected current ratio” and “projected quick ratio”) in a
particular category (“liquidity
measures”)
that are available to subjects. The values
corresponding to an item on a menu remain hidden until subjects press appropriate keys on
the computer keyboard. To continue the previous example, once “projected current ratio” is
selected by a subject, the next screen will reveal the appropriate values.
Subjects analyzed the cases, each of which began with a narrative about the company.
The initial description included a brief biography of the business, a request for a specific

6The extent to which the venture capitalists and the commercial lenders who participated in this study have
dealt with convertible debt was 60% and 3.7% of their total lending activity, respectively. An important observation
that is contrary 10 popular belief is that a significant portion of the loans typically made by the venture capitalists in
our study was not convertible into equity (40%). but consisted of term loans similar to the type of financing requested
in the scenarios in this study.

amount of money, and the general time frame for financing. One start-up company was four
years old and was developing robotic equipment. The other start-up company was three years
old and was developing laser equipment for use in surgical procedures. The mature businesses
were in chemicals and precision engineered metal components
(38 and 22 years old,
respectively). For each case, the software prompted the subject to pick one of the ten source
category titles presented in Table 1; these source category titles represent “chunks”
of
information. Once the subject chose a category, the computer provided a list of titles of
available measures within the category (the data points). The computer then instructed the
subject to choose a data element. Once the computer provided the data element, the subject
would prompt the computer to return to the category menu. The order of items on that menu
varied randomly after each choice, to minimize the possibility of an order effect.7 Thus, the
subject’s information acquisition strategy emerged as the computer recorded the subject’s
strokes within and across categories of information. For financial information, the computer
prompted the subject to select other historical measures (years -2 to 0) or projected measures
(years +l and +2).
Subjects terminated the search, at their option, by making a final loan decision (that is,
by assessing the likelihood of timely repayment and the likelihood of approval). The subjects
then proceeded to the next case. The order in which cases were presented to the subjects was
varied, to minimize a case order effect. A practice case preceded the experiment to enable the
subjects to become familiar with the task and the software.
The experimental
cases were designed to be similar to minimize the variance in
information acquisition procedures that might occur due to the idiosyncratic features within
each case. Each case surpassed a minimal level of quality (e.g., good profitability and low
leverage). Each company exhibited similar profiles for financial information trends, reliability
of management forecasts, risk characteristics, and debt coverage.
The companies, however, did vary in one important way. The experiment included two
types of companies: start-up companies and well-established
companies. This difference in
company type reflected the different experience base of the subjects. Venture capitalists
would find the start-up (well-established)
cases (dis)similar to their experience base. For
commercial lenders, the reverse situation would hold.
Expert judges from practice assessed both the validity of the start-up companies and the
well-established
companies, and the consistency of information across the cases. This was
done to ensure the external validity of the experiment. Following the administration
of the
experiment, subjects assessed the level of similarity across three pairings of companies on a
seven-point

‘Hall (1992) describes the process that is followed by venture capitalists to evaluate ventures as “sequential.”
It is possible that in experiments in which subjects are required to read through the instrument, processes appear to
be sequential purely as an artifact of the experiment. To minimize such demand or order effects, “Search Monitor”
randomizes the order of lists. Thus, selections of items from a list that changes each time it is visited should be based
on importance to the subject rather than on some temporal or sequential basis that is associated with the presentation
of materials. This is not to say that the processes followed by venture capitalists or bankers are not sequential. Rather,
if they are sequential, the randomization of lists by the software allows the researcher to identify this feature of
processing, rather than the experiment driving such a process. Although it is possible that the sequencing of the
description in the case narrative in this study could introduce some degree of sequential processing, the narrative was
brief to try to minimize this effect. In addition, the order of case presentation was randomized to subjects, and a test
of case order found no significant effect.

and purpose, and debt coverage ability). The three pairings included a comparison of both
well-established companies, a comparison of both start-up companies, and a comparison of a
start-up company to a well-established company. Although the cases were in fact similar on
all five dimensions, the participants generally perceived differences between start-up and
well-established companies on each dimension (p < .Ol). These perceived differences provide
a preliminary hint that categorical differences across cases, rather than specific case facts,
drove decision processes and conclusions. The categories evidently prompted some form of
stereotyping. No statistical differences were noted for the other two pairings at the 5% level,
except for reliability (i.e., start-up companies were perceived to be more dissimilar than were
well-established
companies).
Because the research design is based on the premise that venture capitalists and
commercial lenders use different information acquisition strategies for lending decisions, the
fact that the venture capitalists in this study had lending experience similar to commercial
lenders is crucial (see footnote 6). Moreover, the experiment had to be crafted in a manner that
would cue the venture capitalists to view the potential investment as a typical nonconvertible
loan. Four cues were provided in the experimental materials to accomplish this goal. First, the
loans were described as being a package of short-term (less than one year) and medium-term
(four-five years) financing. Second, the loans were stated to be for specific needs, such as
inventory financing and equipment purchases. Third, the size of the loan relative to the
holdings of the venture capital or commercial banking institution was described as small.
Finally, the experimental cases advised that there were no institutional restrictions pertaining
to the loan or loan purpose.

Hypothesis
1, scope of information
repeated-measures
ANOVA models for each type of information
(historical financial,
projected financial, and strategic). VCs were predicted to acquire information from fewer
historical and projected financial categories, but more information from strategic categories,
than CLs.
The dependent variable, scope, was the number of separate categories of information
from which at least one data point was acquired, divided by the number of categories
available for that type of information. Because there are six categories of historical financial
information (see Table l), the metric would be l/6 if an individual acquired information
from only one historical financial category. The same calculation would have been made for
projected financial information because there are also six categories of projected financial
information. In contrast, there are four categories of information in the strategic category.
Here, the acquisition of information from only one category produces a metric of l/4.
Each repeated-measures
ANOVA model included one between-subjects
variable (lender
type: VC or CL), two within-subject
variables (case type: start-up or well-established
company; order within case type: case 1 or case 2 within each case type), and related
interactions (lender type * case type and lender type * order). Expressed differently, each
ANOVA tested the following relationship.
Scope of search = LT, CT, Order, LT * CT, LT * Order,
where LT is lender type and CT is case type.

Hypothesis 2, the depth of information acquisition, was tested using a one-way ANOVA
on the proportions of information acquired by the lender group. VCs were predicted to acquire

more projected financial and strategic information

financial information than CLs. The results are summarized in Figure 1. As expected, venture
capital lenders gathered a smaller proportion of historical financial information and a larger
proportion of strategic information
than commercial
lenders. With regard to projected
financial information, the groups did not differ. For each group, the projections represented
the smallest proportion of the information gathered.
Hypothesis 3, total information acquisition, was tested using MANOVA. The analysis
tested the overall effect of lender type on the total amount of information acquired, the time
spent on the task, and the overall pattern of acquisition. The total amount of information

acquired was the sum of the data points requested by the subject. The time spent on the task
was the number of seconds subjects took to process information and make a judgment. The
pattern of acquisition was a measure of the number of switches across categories compared to
the number of switches within categories. A higher number of switches across categories
would mean a broader search while a higher number of switches within categories would
mean an intense but focused search. The pattern index used here was similar to the search
metric developed by Payne (1976) for choice tasks. Scores, computed as the ratio of
intercategory switches less intracategory switches to total switches, ranged from -1 (focused
within a category) to +I (widespread across categories).
The MANOVA using Wilks’ Lambda indicated a significant difference between lender
types (F = 8.13, p = .0001).Univariate r-tests showed that the lenders differed with respect to
amount (p = .0006) and pattern (p = .0006) in the direction predicted. Commercial lenders
gathered more pieces of information (19 vs. 15) and engaged in a broader search (pattern index
of .27 vs. .03) than venture capital lenders. However, differences between lender types in the
time spent on the task was not statistically significant (p = .7970). Commercial lenders on
average spent 253 seconds with each case compared to 249 seconds for venture capital lenders.
Hypothesis 4 predicted that the strategies for information acquisition would persist
across case types. The three repeated-measures
ANOVA models, formerly described under
Hypothesis 1 and presented in Table 2, support the prediction of persistence. The means
across case types are nearly identical for two means: historical financial information (.584 vs.

<-----Page 13----->456

S87) and projected financial information
(.496 vs. .490). For the third mean, strategic
information,
there is a discernible
but still insignificant
difference
(.729 vs. .658).
Consequently,
the variable for case type is not statistically significant. In addition to the
nonsignificant
variance introduced by case type, there are no significant interactions between
case type and lender type, or case order and lender type, providing further support for the
persistence hypothesis. Finally, again from Table 2, order within case type (ORDER) was not
statistically significant. Subjects did not vary their responses due to maturation effects in a
particular case type (start-up or well-established)
within the experiment.

DISCUSSION
The results provide interesting

insights in three areas. First, the principal results provide
independent evidence that venture capital lenders find unique value in strategic information,
and use that information more directly than bankers. The general finding that commercial
lenders differ from venture capital lenders, and the specific findings that commercial lenders
look at more factors in their decisions and expend more effort to acquire information, support
Hisrich and Jankowicz’s
(1990) suggestion that venture capitalists attempt to reduce
cognitive complexity (effort) when compared to bankers. Hisrich and Jankowicz attributed
their finding to the strategic level of thinking that venture capitalists bring to the task. They
assert that venture capital lenders look at the whole picture. We might add that bankers look
at more details not because they are less interested in the whole picture but because they are
driven by their environment
to search for other business
opportunities
and added
documentation.
In fact, in a post-experimental
survey mailed to participants that asked them
to complete the sentence, “hi general, I search through information
to . . .,” with the
response being a seven-point Likert scale anchored by “find reasons to accept a client’s
financing request” (1) and “find reasons to reject a client’s financing request” (7), the mean
scores were 2.09 and 4.26 for CLs and VCs, respectively (p < .OOl).
The finding that venture capital lenders value strategic information is consistent with the
findings reported by Sandberg and Hofer (1987), Sandberg et al. (1988), and Tyebjee and
Bruno (1984). The results reported here are for more direct tests of the information acquisition
process than the retrospective and introspective approaches used in previous studies. This
study’s confirmation
of earlier results speaks to the skill of the previous researchers in
designing their studies, and provides indirect support for the continued use of well-designed
stimulations, verbal protocol analyses, and case analyses for the study of venture capitalists’
decision-making
processes.
Second, the limited search attention granted to the projected financial information by
both commercial
and venture capital lenders suggests that projections
are routinely
discounted. Apparently, the strategic factors that guide the projections (market attractiveness,
differentiation, the business environment) are presumed more credible than the projections for
both types of lenders. Two different explanations for this phenomenon are available. First, the
lenders could be responding to the belief that the borrowers are engaged in impression
management. Second, lenders could be responding to the belief that future returns represent
random variables. Each explanation is plausible, and worthy of further inquiry. In the case of
commercial lenders, a third explanation is possible. These lenders search for information that
the loan can be covered, and that information is in the financials (leverage, liquidity, etc.).
Once it is known that the loan can be covered, then further information about finances is
redundant in the commercial
lender’s search. This explanation
is consistent with the
behavioral economists’ notion of “satisficing”
(Cyert and March 1963).

Third, persistence of search strategies across case types suggests that information
acquisition strategies are stable despite changes in the objective situation. In organizational
theory, the persistence of inappropriate routines is called entropy. For seekers of capital,
persistence leads to the suggestion that applicants should respond to the natural search style
of their audience. Historical financial information is more important in the case of commercial
lending, whereas strategic information
is more valued in the case of venture lending.
Extending study of the phenomenon of persistence to decisions about capital leads to the
suggestion that we need to know more about both the cost and strength of persistence in this
and other decision contexts. Information acquisition strategies formed in one domain may be
harmful in another domain. Expertise, the formation of an information acquisition strategy
that is successful in one domain, may lower adaptability across domains.
Like all research, this study has strengths and weaknesses. This study investigates
information acquisition strategies across two groups of lenders, which allows us to use one
group as a benchmark for the other. However, we do not directly consider the variance in
information acquisition strategies within each group. As Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990) note,
venture capitalists appear to vary widely in their approach to decision-making.
A natural
extension of their observation would be a study of the variety of information acquisition
strategies among venture capitalists, and a test of the impact of varied strategies on decision
outcomes. Do venturers who pay more attention to strategic details, and/or less attention to
of information
financial details, make “better” decisions? Studies of the relationship
acquisition strategies and decision outcomes would be a logical outgrowth of the present paper.
Computer-based research methods offer promise for interesting explorations into these and
other important topics about the venture capital decision-making
processes. The computer
minimizes researcher intrusion in the decision task and permits the collection of process data
from samples large enough to permit statistical analyses. The subject exclusively determines the
length of the task, the direction of the search, etc. In contrast to concurrent verbal protocol
analysis, computer search is in many respects less labor intensive. For example, whereas verbal
protocol analysis involves developing and refining coding rules, transcribing verbal reports,
multiple coding of verbal protocol phrases, and reconciliation of differences among the coders,
the labor intensive component of computer search is limited to preparing the experimental
materials for use on the computer. Once collected, computer data in many of the software
packages can be directly transferred to an output file for use in statistical analysis. Thus, it is
more practical to collect data from a large number of subjects using computer search, which in
turn permits statistical analysis that may not be appropriate for concurrent verbal protocol data
because of sample size limitations (Biggs et al. forthcoming).
Computer-based experiments are not perfect methods of inquiry. In the present case, the
lack of differences in time spent may be an artifact of the experiment. In their attempt to finish
four cases, the respondents may have divided their time equally (although no time limits were
announced for the overall experiment). In addition, the efficiency of the computer method
might be obtained at the expense of the richness of the data. For example, venture capitalists
studying a single plan have ample opportunity to reflect on subtle signals and may have more
complete data sets. However, similar limitations exist in most experimental research. Finally,
observational methods, participant recall, and verbal protocols might best capture dimensions
of processing other than information acquisition, such as evaluation and integration of
information.9

9 We are grateful to a blind reviewer for making more clear to us these limitations of computer search.

Of course, researcher judgment determines the categories of information
and the
description of the case situations, both of which could be a source of bias when using computer
search. Throughout, we tried to minimize that bias and to measure whether or not it occurred
through process checks for validity. Despite the care, some bias may persist. For example, we
model decisions as a rational process, although mimetic or social processes might provide a more
useful explanation. However, these particular biases would persist regardless of whether
computer search or another research method, such as verbal protocol analysis, was used.
Research insights on data collection methods will accrue as scholars use a variety of methods to
investigate alternative decision behavior. We hope that computer-based experimentation will
prove to be a useful complement to other methods of inquiry.
