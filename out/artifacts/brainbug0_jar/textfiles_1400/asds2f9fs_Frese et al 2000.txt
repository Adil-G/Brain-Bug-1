Abstract
A theoretical analysis of individual level planning and action strategy by small business
owners/managers distinguishes five different processes: Complete (top-down) Planning, Critical
Point, Opportunistic, Reactive and Routine/Habit. Research on 80 small, start-up owners in the
Netherlands showed that as hypothesized, a Reactive Strategy was negatively related to firm
success, while a Critical Point Strategy was positively related. The combination of Critical Point
and Opportunistic Strategy was most and the combination of Opportunistic and Reactive was least
successful.

Strategies and Success

Introduction

This study takes a psychological point of view to look at process characteristics of action
strategies of small scale business owners; these strategy characteristics are then related to the firms’
success. We want to provide an answer to the question, how strategies are used and how strategyrelevant behavior by the owner/manager is related to success in the small business.
Regardless of the degree of rationality and explicitness, founders of new ventures follow a
strategy to reach their goals. Frequently, strategies have been differentiated into content and process
characteristics (Austin and Vancouver, 1997; Dess, Lumpkin and Covin, 1997; Hart, 1992; Olson
and Bokor, 1995; Rajagopolan, Rasheed and Datta, 1993; Rauch & Frese, in press). The strategy
content specifies which kind of strategy is used, for example low costs, differentiation, or
focus/niche strategies (Porter, 1980). The strategy process on the other hand refers to how one
formulates and implements the strategy content (Olson and Bokor, 1995). In this study, we will
focus on the action strategy process. In contrast to most strategy process literature which focuses on
the firm level, we will do so by regarding the action strategy process as a characteristic of the
founder and manager of the firm (Rajagopolan et al., 1993). We regard the strategy process on the
individual level because of a particular feature of small start-up firms. The pervasive influence of
founders on their firms, and their dominance in making decisions, makes it possible to assume a
high degree of equivalence between the individual and the organizational levels of analysis.
Strategies have been researched in psychology under the topic of thinking and problem
solving. Strategy is defined by a plan of action, that is a sequence of means to achieve a goal
(Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960). Thus, the concept of strategy emphasizes, how to reach a
goal, while the goal development itself is outside the concept of strategy. The function of a
strategy is to deal with uncertain situations because a strategy presents a template that can be
applied in various situations. Thus, it helps to deal with the limited processing capacity of the
human mind (Frese and Zapf, 1994; Hacker, 1989; Kahneman, 1973).

3

<-----Page 3----->Cognitive and action theories have differentiated the following process characteristics of
strategies (Hacker, 1986; Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth, 1979; Zempel, 1994): Complete Planning,
Critical Point, Opportunistic, and Reactive Strategies. A person using a Complete Planning
Strategy plans ahead and actively structures the situation. Complete Planning Strategy implies a
more comprehensive representation of the work process, a longer time frame to plan ahead, and a
larger inventory of signals, a better knowledge and anticipation of error situations, and a more
proactive orientation (Frese and Zapf, 1994; Hacker, 1986). The Critical Point Strategy (Zempel,
1994) starts out with the most difficult, most unclear, and most important point and works on this
one first. Only after solving the first critical point, further steps may be planned; it constitutes an
iterative problem solving strategy. Thus, one has a clear goal in mind and one concentrates on it
and on the main issues of one's tasks - it is a sort of main-issue-planning. In contrast, an
Opportunistic Strategy starts out with some form of rudimentary planning, but the person using an
opportunistic strategy deviates from these plans easily when opportunities arise (Hayes-Roth and
Hayes-Roth, 1979). Thus, this strategy is not top-down and systematic. While, there is a certain
amount of local planning in the Opportunistic Strategy, one may loose sight of one's goals or let
one's goals be determined by the opportunities. On the other hand, Opportunistic Strategy is not
completely driven by the situation as the Reactive Strategy; the Opportunistic Strategy is much
more proactive. A Reactive Strategy implies that one reacts to the situation; one does not plan, one
is not goal oriented, one is driven by the immediate situational demands without influencing them
because the Reactive Strategy is not proactive.
Our first pilot interviews and action theory (Frese and Zapf, 1994) convinced us that we
needed a fifth category. In contrast to the strategies discussed up to this point, people sometimes
just use their routines without any explicit decision for a strategy. For this reason, we added
routine/habit as a fifth variable. This is a standardized approach which has once been developed in
redundant environments. It is not a considered strategy for this particular situation. When using
this approach, there is little planning, proactivity, but people know their environment well. There
is also little learning, because one essentially does things the same way as always.
The four strategies - Reactive, Opportunistic, Complete Planning and Critical Point – and
Routine/Habit can be differentiated according to orientation to the goal, how long term one plans,
situational responsiveness, proactiveness, and the overlap between planning and action. Table 1
4

<-----Page 4----->describes the strategy characteristics on these dimensions. One can have a high or low goal
orientation. One prerequisite of a Complete Planning Strategy with its top-down approach and the
Critical Point Strategy is that they are highly focussed on a goal and take the goal very serious.
This goal orientation is rather low if one uses an Opportunistic or Reactive Strategy.
Routines/Habits have been developed for redundant environments; therefore, there is no
considered goal orientation and it is, therefore, assumed to be low.
Planning takes resources, primarily because it implies that one thinks about future steps. In
the Planning Strategy, there is planning before one actually starts acting; therefore, long term
planning is done to a high degree. In the Critical Point Strategy, there is a certain amount of a
priori planning. In the Opportunistic Strategy, there is no long term planning beforehand but there
is a small amount of planning, while one is acting. The Reactive Strategy is characterized by the
absence of planning. Routine/Habit is characterized by a low degree of conscious a priori planning
because it is a routine application of a plan devised some time before.
Situational responsiveness is in many ways the opposite of goal orientation and long-term
planning. We assume that Complete Planning is lowest in situational responsiveness because
developing a plan sometimes leads to a certain rigidity towards environmental demands (Rauch &
Frese, 1998). Since there are lower investments into planning in the Critical Point Strategy, there
should be a middle degree of situational responsiveness. One can be highly responsive to the
situation by just reacting to the situation (Reactive Strategy) or by having multidirectional plans
with an emphasis on using environmental opportunities that are proactively searched for
(Opportunistic Strategy). Routine/Habit is characterized by a low responsiveness to the situation
because the once-developed plan of action just unfolds without thinking about the situation again.
Routines are sometimes continued inappropriately even if environments change (Frese & Zapf,
1994).
Proactiveness implies that one actively structures the situation, thinks of future problems
and adjusts one’s plans accordingly and searches for opportunities. Proactiveness is high in
Complete Planning and Critical Point Planning because in both cases, one thinks of future
problems and develops plans to change the situation. The Opportunistic Strategy is active
precisely because it actively scans the environment for potential opportunities. In contrast,
proactiveness is absent in the Reactive Strategy and in Routine/Habit.
5

<-----Page 5----->Planning and action overlap implies that planning is not done a priori but during the action
itself. From a psychological point of view, it is well possible that we have not developed any plan
before we start an action but that the plan is developed while we continue our actions. Complete
planning is defined by a priori planning; therefore, there is little overlap between planning and
action because the action follows the planning. Critical point planning only plans out the critical
point a priori; therefore this strategy is in a middle position. Opportunistic Strategy implies that
one changes one’s plans if opportunities arise; this necessitates a certain amount of planning while
continuing with the action. This is in contrast to the reactive strategy which is characterized by no
conscious planning; the same is also true of Routine/Habit.

Table 1 about here

Our categorization of action strategies shows some resemblance to Miles and Snow's
(1978) typology with the Reactor using a Reactive Strategy, the Prospector using an Opportunistic
Strategy, and the Analyzer using a Complete Planning Strategy (cf. also Doty, Glick and Huber,
1993). Their concept of Defender has no equivalence in our cognitive and action theory derived
categorization. There are also some similarities to a typology suggested by Mintzberg (1978) with
the Rational Mode being similar to our Complete Planning and the Entreprenerial Mode being
similar to our Opportunistic Strategy. The third Mode - Bargaining - only pertains to large
companies and, therefore, has no equivalence in our categorizations. Finally, there is some
resemblance to Miller and Friesen's (1982) differentiation between innovation in conservative and
entrepreneurial firms (compare also Chell, Haworth, and Brearley, 1991). The conservative firm
uses a reactive strategy while the entrepreneurial firm uses an opportunistic strategy.
These strategies should be differentially related to success of small scale business owners.
Small scale business owners are successful, if they achieve their goals The Reactive Strategy
should be counterproductive because not choosing a plan of action, not having clear cut plans lets
the owner to be at the mercy of situational influences without anticipating them. Employees using
this strategy have been shown to be less effective (Hacker, 1992).
All other strategies can be effective depending upon the situation. The situation for the
start-up firms is usually fraught with a high degree of uncertainty and the necessity to make quick
6

<-----Page 6----->decisions (Bhide, 1994). The necessity to make quick decisions under a high degree of uncertainty
suggests that a pure Complete Planning Strategy is probably not very effective for start-up
owners/managers because it takes too much time and effort to plan for all sorts of eventualities
(Bhide, 1994). On the other hand, this strategy has been shown to be advantageous in various
contexts (Hacker, 1986; Rauch and Frese, 1997). However, Complete Planning costs time, money,
and effort and it may lead to a certain rigidity because one tends to stick to a plan once one has
developed it. Once one has planned a strategy in detail, one tends to adhere to the plan and
therefore one develops a certain amount of rigidity (because of the investment in the plan, one
does not want to give up the plan too quickly). The Complete Planning Strategy as used here is not
the same as developing a formal business plan. Rather, it consists of a methodical top down
approach to everyday situations, such as telling the personnel what to do or planning a marketing
effort for this month.
If only one strategy is used, we think that the Critical Point Strategy is probably the best
one for start-up firms. It makes it necessary to do some amount of planning because the business
owner has to decide which issues are most important and should be tackled first. In contrast to the
Complete Planning Strategy, it does not lead to a rigid adherence to an overall plan, although
Critical Point gives a clear structure of what is important and what is not. Moreover, business
owners are constantly working at a high level of load of their processing capacity because they
have to make constant decisions in a highly uncertain situation. When focusing only on the main
points, one needs less cognitive resources than when developing a full top down plan. Lumpkin
and Dess (1995) argue similarly for the superiority of a simple strategy for young firms. Critical
Point allows people to be action oriented.
An Opportunistic Strategy may be advantageous in an uncertain environment. Its positive
points are that one proactively searches for opportunities and acts on them. However, in contrast to
Critical Point, it may have too little structure. One may loose sight of what is really important.
Strategies can be used in combination. Any combination with a Reactive Strategy should
be ineffective, particularly when there is no further clear plan, as when Opportunistic and Reactive
Strategies are combined. The best combination should be to use both Critical Point and
Opportunistic Strategies. The Critical Point Strategy makes it possible to establish what is

7

<-----Page 7----->important, and the Opportunistic Strategy orients the business owner to important information
from the environment.
The cognitive and action theoretic approach used in our theory is oriented towards
individual actions and their preparation through strategies. Any simple analogy of individual
actions with organizational actions is problematic. Organizations do not act in the same sense as
individuals. However, in the case of small scale starters, individual actions are exceedingly
important because the owners/managers have a high degree of influence on their small
organization. Their personal action strategies will determine the outcomes to a high degree
because organizational procedures have not yet been formalized, because new situations arise
constantly and have to be dealt with by the most dominant figure who is usually the founder.
Personal action strategies are not the same as personality variables nor are they completely
situationally determined. Action strategies can be changed at will, do not have to be temporally
stable, and are changeable depending upon the situation. However, there are limits to the
changeability of strategies; people cannot develop new ways of doing things in each situation.
Were people to do that, they would have no sense of coherence and self and their processing
capacity would be constantly overloaded (Kahneman, 1973). Thus, ready made strategies allow
the person to deal with those situations.
Our conceptualization of process characteristics of action strategies leads to the following
hypotheses:
1) Reactive Strategy is negatively related to success.
2) Critical Point Strategy is positively related to success of start-up firms and is the best strategy.
3) The combination of Critical Point Strategy and Opportunistic Strategy is the best strategy
combination.
No specific hypotheses were advanced with regard to Routine/Habit, Opportunistic and
Planning Strategy. Opportunistic and Planning Strategy have both positive and negative features
for start-up firms and we are not able to differentiate these effects with our research design.
Routine/Habit is not really a conscious strategy, and, therefore, not the primary interest of this
paper.

<-----Page 8----->Method
Sample
Our sample consists of 80 small scale business founders who were owners and managers at the
same time in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We chose to select starters for several reasons: First,
start-up firms are usually small and the influence of the owners is very high. Since our study
concentrated on the owners' strategies, we wanted to get those owners who had a high impact on
their firm. For this reason we excluded all businesses with more than 50 employees. Second,
success is more varied in small start-up firms because with time there is a selection process that
weeds out unsuccessful firms (Bruederl, Preisendoerfer and Ziegler, 1992). We did not
differentiate between entrepreneurs and small scale business owners (Carland, Hoy, Boulton, and
Carland, 1984) because our subjects were too new in their business as to be able to make this
differentiation. Further, we wanted to be deliberately broad and have business owners from
various industries because the founder's strategy characteristics may also determine in which
industry a business is founded. However, we excluded retail, repair shops, bars, and restaurants
because we wanted to choose industries that allowed a high degree of freedom to maneuver and
that were of moderate to high complexity.
Our sample is representative of small scale business founders in Amsterdam. The chamber
of commerce provided us with a random sample of addresses of firms that were founded between
1990 and 1995 and had at least 1 and at most 50 employees. This provided us with a good data
base because all business owners are required to register with the chamber of commerce. This list
was compared with the yellow pages and other telephone guides to check whether their addresses
were still correct. Because we concentrated on start-ups, we also included one center for small
scale start-up firms.
In all, 236 were contacted. Of these, 60 did not fall into our sample description (for
example , they only had a change in legal status of an older firm, or were free lancers). Of those
who fit our criteria, 76 declined to participate. Thus, 100 small scale business owners participated
in the study. We additionally excluded 7 who turned out in the interview not to be the founders of
their business, 7 whose companies had been so recently established that it was not possible to get a
good success measure, 1 whose company went out of business, and 5 who turned out to have no
employees. This gives us a sample of 80 business owners for this study. Table 2 presents the
9

<-----Page 9----->characteristics of this sample. As one can see, most of them were male, highly educated, not
technologically innovative, and had a small amount of start-up capital; the business owners were
evenly divided across the different industries.
On average the company was 4 years old; while companies of this age are not exactly in
the first start-up phase any more, they are usually not yet completely established in the market.
--------------------------Table 2 about here:
---------------------------Operationalization of the Variables
Both structured interviews and questionnaires were used. The interviews were structured as
we asked all subjects the same starting questions and had a numerical coding scheme to rate the
interviews. However, we used additional prepared prompts that varied from person to person if the
interviewers thought that they needed additional information. All interview responses were coded
by two coders. Structured interviews often have very good validity as meta-analyses show (for
example, Wiesner and Cronshaw, 1988). The strategy characteristics and some of the success
measures could be better ascertained in an interview than in a questionnaire because the interviews
allowed us to probe into the answers. Moreover action strategies are better described in stories told
by the interviewees than in sole use of questionnaire items. When interview responses are coded,
there is a single anchor point and, thus, one source of error that is common in questionnaire studies
is reduced. The interviews were tape recorded and were later coded by two authors of this paper.
Some variables were ascertained in a questionnaire. The questionnaire was filled out before the
interview but with the interviewers present. After this, the interview started. The interview took
around 20 - 30 minutes, the questionnaire took about 20 minutes. All the inter-rater reliabilities,
Cronbach's Alphas, the Means and the Standard Deviations of the scales are included in Table 3.
By and large the alphas and inter-rater reliabilities are adequate (Nunnally, 1978). A procedure of
mean substitution of items in scales was used to reduce the problem of missing data.

Table 3 about here

10

<-----Page 10----->Success Variables. Both personal and economic success measures were used 1 .
Entrepreneurship research should use multiple measures of success because any one measure is
prone to errors which may be due to the tax structure, to memory problems, and reporting biases
(for example, social desirability). Economic success includes growth or decline of sales, profit,
investments, personnel, and personal income since the start of the company. The firm owners gave
figures for the growth or decline of the amount of personal income and the number of employees
which were rated on a five point scale. Additionally, changes in sales, profit and investment were
measured by asking the business owners to draw these changes from the start of the company to
the present time into a graph (this measure was modelled after a measure used by Bruederl et al.,
1992). These curves were rated on a scale from 1-5. (Since the interrater reliability was very high
with an r=.96, we did not use the mean of the two coders for economic success). Personal success
asked on the extent of start-up goals realized. In addition, 9 questions on success were asked (for
example, "I can offer my personnel a steady/secure job"). All success items were scored on a five
point answer scale and the total scale score was divided by the number of items. We combined the
personal and economic success into a total success score because they were correlated and to make
the presentation of the results more transparent.
Action strategy characteristics . We used a behavior event procedure (Spencer and
Spencer, 1993) to analyze the strategy characteristics in the interview. The business owners were
asked to report their way of dealing with common aspects of running a business, like getting
customers, dealing with personnel, product development and they were asked to give concrete
examples of what they were actually doing. For each one of these areas the interviewers
ascertained what strategy characteristics were used. The interviewers asked several questions to
force the interviewees to become more and more concrete and to make it possible to decide on a
differential diagnosis of the strategies.
The coding procedure was the following: After the interview each interviewer gave
separately his first impression on how the interviewee was doing things in general (across the
situations asked in the interview). This judgment was expressed as a percentage for each of the 5
strategies. After this, the interviewers would listen to the interview tapes and would read the
1

The coding scheme for the success measures and for the process characteristics (the strategies) can be
received from the authors.

11

<-----Page 11----->questionnaire responses on the judgment of action strategies done by the interviewees. From this,
they would correct their first judgment and come to a final judgment, again each interviewer
separately. Inter-rater reliabilities for the five strategies were on average .66 (between .61 and .72)
for the first impression and .75 (between .63 and .90) for the final judgment. These are adequate
reliabilities. To increase the reliability of the final measure, the mean of both interviewers'
estimates were taken.
Our measurement approach is ipsative (forced choice) as the interviewers were supposed to
add up all the action strategies to a total of 100 per cent (in Bertram's 1996 terminology, we used
semi-ipsative measures). This means, that by design, there is a negative correlation between the
different strategies (since giving a high score on one, automatically, reduces the possibility of
giving a high score on another strategy). There is a lively debate on ipsative measures in work and
organizational psychology that has not been completely resolved (Bartram, 1996; Baron, 1996;
Cornwall and Dunlop, 1994; Saville and Willson, 1991). An ipsative measurement has
advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that the interviewers are forced to make deliberate
comparisons and that the scaling of the strategies is done on the same dimension with the same
meaning (percentage of time used). It also makes intuitive sense because it mimics the practical
situation that one has to make (sometimes hard) decisions between alternative approaches (Baron,
1996). The disadvantage is based on the fact that the answers are not independent of each other.
For this reason, the intercorrelations amongst the strategies were nearly all negative (if one adopts
one strategy very strongly, others were getting a lower percentage automatically). This means that
regression weights in a regression analysis that includes all strategies cannot be interpreted.
Therefore, we calculated several regression analyses, including only one of the strategies at a time.
Control variables. Research on small scale business owners has customarily demanded that
certain controls should be included in the studies (Dess, Ireland and Hitt, 1990). For this reason
we have asked single questions on the age of the company, on industry experience of the owner,
on industry type (with manufacturing, trade, service), and the amount of start-up capital.

Results
Table 3 describes the intercorrelations of the variables. The intercorrelations of the action
strategies were mainly negative because of the ipsative nature of measurement. The means for the
12

<-----Page 12----->three strategies Planning, Critical Point, and Opportunistic were of equal size. Only Reactive
Strategy and Routine/Habit were used infrequently.
The relationships between the strategies and the success measures were rather clear cut and
in line with our hypotheses 1 and 2: Both Critical Point and Reactive Strategies were significantly
correlated with Success in the predicted direction (Critical Point Strategy being positively and
Reactive Strategy being negatively related to success). When all the strategies were taken together
in a multiple correlation, 19 percent of the variance of the overall success measure could be
explained by the strategies. Since strategies are by necessity only one part of a full explanation of
firms’ and owners’ success, this is quite a substantial multiple correlation.

Tables 3 and 4 about here

Table 4 presents the relationships of the strategy characteristics with success in hierarchical
multiple regression analyses with various controls included in the first step that might have an
impact on success as well (age of company, industry experience of owner, two dummy variables
describing the three industries involved, and the start-up capital). In the second step a strategy was
included (note, we could not include all of the strategies in one regression analysis because of their
ipsative nature of their measurement). The results confirmed the results of the zero order
correlations. Critical Point showed a significantly positive and Reactive Strategy showed a
significantly negative relationships with success after controlling for the control variables in step
1. The only significant Beta for the control variables was for age of company, which replicates the
customary "liability of newness" problem (Bruederl et al., 1992).

Table 5 about here

The left column of Table 5 presents the dominant strategy, that is the one most frequently
used (15 people with a tie did not have a dominant strategy and were, therefore, excluded from this
analysis). Planned contrasts showed that the worst strategy was the Reactive one (t=3.25, p<.01
comparing Reactive vs. all other dominant strategies) and that there was a tendency for the best
one to be the Critical Point Strategy (t=1.51, p<.10, one-tailed for Critical Point vs. all other
13

<-----Page 13----->strategies). While Routine/Habit is not really a strategy (and was not often mentioned), it is a sort
of fall back system, in case one does not develop a conscious strategy. The high scores may have
been a function of the experience of the business owners who used this frequently.
People used strategies in combination, of course, and the respective results are displayed in
the right part of Table 5. Since the n is partly very low, these are suggestive data only (15 people
with a tie and cells with frequencies of n < 4 were excluded from this analysis). There were overall
ANOVA significant differences. Planned contrasts showed that the best combination was to use
both Critical Point and Opportunistic Strategies (t=2.42, p<.01 for this combination against all
other ones). The worst combination was Opportunistic and Reactive Strategies (t=6.40, p<.01 for
this combination versus all others). These results are in line with our hypothesis 3 which stated
that Critical Point and Opportunistic Strategies should be the best combination.
It is interesting to note that the most successful combination (Critical Point- Opportunistic)
was also the most frequently used one (with 38 per cent of the business owners using this
combination).

Discussion
Our results showed that process characteristics of action strategies are related to of owners'
success. Process characteristics of strategies are related to the owner/managers’ actions. Therefore,
it is not surprising that 19 per cent of the total success measure is predicted by these strategies. The
results were the same for the more economic measure of success (growth in sales, profit, etc.) and
the more personal success (reaching one’s goals)
The most important positive strategy characteristic is Critical Point. This means that people
who only concentrate on the most important or difficult part of a situation, will do best in their
business. This is an important finding, both for psychology in general and for entrepreneurship
research in particular. Cognitive Psychology has not yet discussed the concept of Critical Point
Strategy. It was introduced by Zempel (1994) in an as yet unpublished master's thesis who also
found the Critical Point Strategy to be particularly useful in her study of German craft masters
(Meister). Obviously, it is an important addition to the study of strategies.
In terms of combinations, the best combination of strategies was Critical Point and
Opportunistic Strategies, the worst one combining Opportunistic and Reactive Strategies. This
14

<-----Page 14----->shows that localized planning combined with a quick reaction to environmental opportunities and
with a clear concept of what is important is the best way to run a start-up firm – at least during the
first years.
For entrepreneurship research, the differentiation of different forms of planning used in this
article may be of importance. As Schwenk and Shrader (1993) pointed out, the relationship
between strategic planning (as customarily defined by management science) and success is not as
high as one would expect. Often, only formal planning (usually conceptualized as having a formal
business plan) is considered in research (Matthews and Scott, 1995; Olson and Bokor, 1995).
Maybe a more differentiated conceptualization of what planning means is helpful. In our study,
there are three strategies related to planning for everyday problems in some way: Complete
Planning Strategy which attempts to use a top down approach and is not related to success.
Opportunistic Strategy which interjects periods of planning into acting on opportunities. It has
been deemed to be an important strategy in cognitive science (Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth,
1979), but does not seem to be so clearly related to business ownership success, although its
combination with Critical Point was successful. The best strategy - Critical Point - also implies
some degree of planning, albeit a rudimentary form. Using a different approach and a different
population, Sonnentag (1997) has also shown that a Complete Planning Strategy process is not as
useful as a strategy she calls "local planning" (cf. also Sonnentag, 1996). Local planning is quite
similar to our concept of Critical Point. The opposite of any planning is the Reactive Strategy and
it is clearly the worst strategy in our study. This is in line with Miles and Snow's (1978)
hypothesis that reactors are least successful in the market (Doty, Glick and Huber, 1993). Our
results reinforce the argument that some restricted form of planning is necessary for success.
The major contribution of our study was to develop a process concept of action strategies
by differentiating various forms of planning and proactivity of individual business owners.
However, as any study our research also has limitations. The most important limitation is that we
have not looked at interactions between strategies and environmental factors. Miles and Snow
(1978) and Mintzberg (1979) have suggested that certain strategies are only useful given a certain
environment. Theoretically and empirically, it makes sense that planning is of reduced use in a
chaotic and unpredictable environment in which a person has only very little control (Frese,
Albrecht, Kreuscher, von Papstein, Pruemper, and Schulte-Goecking, 1995; Matthews and Scott,
15

<-----Page 15----->1995). However, if planning involves back-up plans if something goes wrong, it may work well in
such a situation as well. This short discussion implies that one has to look in quite some detail into
the planning process vis-a-vis a situation before one can actually test the interaction of strategies
and the environment. This probably requires an experimental or laboratory observational study
which has the disadvantage that no realistic success variable can be ascertained.
Nevertheless, environmental factors should be incorporated into studies of strategies in the
future. However, one should not assume that the environmental conditions for small scale business
owners show extreme differences. In some sense being a start-up firm is already a situational
characteristic. Nearly all small start-up firms have to operate in an uncertain environment.
Moreover, most start-up firms use a simple structure in Mintzberg's terminology.
Our process model of strategy could also reasonably interact with the content of a strategic.
Olson and Bokor (1995) provide an example of the interaction between formal planning and
innovation. It is a reasonable hypothesis that, for example, a niche strategy should be planned
formally (using a Complete Planning Strategy or Critical Point), while individualized customer
orientation may work better within the framework of an opportunistic process.
Another limiting factor is culture. While some studies do not find interaction between
strategies and national environments (Shane and Kolvereid, 1995), a study by Rauch and Frese
(1997) has shown that in Ireland, a culture with a low degree of uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede,
1991), detailed planning was actually counterproductive while there was a high positive
relationship between detailed planning and success in Germany, a country with a somewhat higher
degree of uncertainty avoidance. The Netherlands shows a similar uncertainty avoidance score to
Germany. Thus, one can assume that our results would not necessarily be reproduced in low
uncertainty avoidance countries, such as Jamaica or Singapore.
Another limitation is related to our methodology. Since we used a cross sectional
approach, we had to rely on the owners' memory for strategy use. It is a plausible alternative
hypothesis that non-successful owners attribute their failures to the environment and emphasize
that they were forced by the environment to do certain kinds of things (fundamental attributional
error, Ross, 1977). In our scheme this would show up as a reactive strategy.
A problem of many business ownership studies is the survivor bias. All business in our
sample was successful in the sense that they had survived thus far. We attempted to control for this
16

<-----Page 16----->problem, in restricting our sample to new start-ups who were on the market for less than 6 years.
This restriction to study only start-up firms and their owners, also solves to a certain extent the
usual problem of how to define the sample.
This study relied on success variables that were based on the interview. Of course,
interviews start out with the information provided by the study participant. However, well
designed interviews can use prompts to ascertain what the interviewee really meant and to check
on their answers by asking for concrete examples, and they avoid the scale anchor problem of
questionnaires because the trained coders use the same scale anchors throughout. Our
measurement concept of using interview responses of strategies and success, that were later coded
by two coders, avoided some of the single source problems. One could argue, however, that we
ascertained both strategies and success from the same source (the owner) and that this leads to a
common method variance problem. We think that common method variance is unlikely because
strategies have little social desirability implications. Even reactive strategies were seen by the
owners as quite agreeable because they showed that they were responsive to the situation.
Moreover, the way we ascertained the strategy characteristcs was that we asked them to tell us
stories of how they proceed and we prompted them in detail on how they did things. Generally,
structured interviews of this type have been shown to show good reliability in selection research
and, therefore, we think that the likelihood of social desirability in the measurement of strategies is
low. In contrast, we believe that social desirability does play a role in success measures. However,
here the problem is that it is practically impossible to get other measures (for example archival
ones) from small scale business starters. For example, a measure like archival profit rate cannot be
used because most owners try to reduce profit as much as possible to pay little tax (and are able to
do that). Similar problems appear with nearly all other archival data (Boyd, Dess, and Rasheed,
1993). On the other hand, we have included in our success measure items on growth of turnover
and personnel which are unlikely to be heavily biased and which show high correlations with the
overall success measure.
Practically, our results may have implications for banks and advisors. It is often argued that
top down planning is the preferred strategy characteristic. There is some truth to this idea: The
direct opposite of planning - Reactive Strategy - turns out to be bad in our study, because it
combines little goal orientation, little planning, and little proactivity. Nevertheless, there other
17

<-----Page 17----->forms of planning, such as critical point planning and the opportunistic strategy which may
sometimes better contribute to the firms’ success than top down planning. Obviously, the
relationships between strategies and success found in this study are not static. In certain situations
(for example, a major recession - Holland was in a boom situation at the time that the participating
businesses were in existence) and at different stages in the business life cycle, different forms of
planning may be differentially successful. For example, it may be more useful to use a planning
strategy when the firms become larger and when the owners have a better grasp of the exact
conditions under which they do business.
Thus, this study has shown that a paradigm – strategy characteristics – that is highly related
to the actions of the owner/managers is lawfully related to the success of the firms and the owners.
This may be one step to develop a fuller picture of the psychology of business success.
