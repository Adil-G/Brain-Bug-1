<-----Page 0----->Angel investors’ and entrepreneurs’ intentions to exit their ventures: A conflict perspective

ABSTRACT

This study examines the relationship between angel investor-entrepreneur relationship conflicts,
task conflicts and goal conflicts on the one hand and their intentions to exit on the other hand. We
evaluate our hypotheses with survey data from 65 angel investors and 72 entrepreneurs,
belonging to 54 ventures located in either California or Belgium. Regression analyses indicate
that entrepreneurial intentions to exit are higher for those entrepreneurs who face more task and
goal conflicts. Angel investors‟ intentions to exit are only increased when faced with more goal
conflicts. Together, these results indicate the importance of taking into account investorentrepreneur relations when studying their respective exit processes.

INTRODUCTION

For decades, scholars have argued that exit represents one of the key events in the
relationship between external investors and entrepreneurs (Black and Gilson, 1998; Mason,
2006). In line with the broader literature on the investor-investee dyad (Lockett et al., 2006), exit
studies have generally investigated the topic from either the investor‟s (e.g. Mason and Harrison,
2002; Parhankangas and Landström, 2006; Van Osnabrugge, 2000) or the entrepreneur‟s
standpoint (e.g. DeTienne and Cardon, 2010; Wennberg et al., 2010). With regard to investor
exit, scholars have advanced our understanding of investor preferences in terms of how (e.g. IPO,
acquisition, trade sale) and when to exit, determinants of these exit preferences and the role of
contracts in the exit decision (Cumming and MacIntosh, 2003; Freear et al., 2002; Hellmann,
2006; Mason and Harrison, 2002). Similarly, entrepreneurial exit research has provided some
insight into the influence of venture performance and entrepreneurs‟/founders‟ characteristics on
the decision why and how to exit ventures (Boeker and Karichalil, 2002; DeTienne and Cardon,
2010; Ucbasaran et al., 2003a; Wennberg et al., 2010).
1

<-----Page 1----->What both streams of literature have in common is that they have generally depicted
entrepreneurs and investors as independent actors. In doing so, the context in which these parties
are embedded has been neglected. Previous research has indicated though that investigating the
nature and social aspects of exchange relationships, including investor-entrepreneur relationships
(De Clercq and Sapienza, 2006; Lockett et al., 2006), is crucial in gaining a better understanding
of their effectiveness (Granovetter, 1985). The relationship between investors and entrepreneurs
may be especially important for one specific class of equity investors, namely angel investors,
considering their concern for agency risk and resulting emphasis on post-investment involvement
(Fiet, 1995; Van Osnabrugge, 2000). Some have even argued that it is the primary means through
which angel investors add value (Freear et al., 1995; Politis, 2008).

Addressing this gap in the exit literature, we focus on one specific aspect of the angel
investor-entrepreneur partnership; their relationship, task and goal conflicts. A growing body of
research has recognized that the angel investor-entrepreneur relationship is not always rosy
(Brettel, 2003; Mason and Harrison, 1996). To our knowledge, no empirical work has examined
angel investor-entrepreneur conflicts and very little work has been done even as it relates to
conflicts between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs (see Higashide and Birley (2002),
Parhankangas and Landström (2006) and Yitshaki (2008) for some of this work). Given that
conflict is a clear stressor (Bayazit and Mannix, 2003), looking at individual investor or
entrepreneurial exit through the perspective of conflict theory should prove useful.

Task and relationship conflicts are commonly used in studies on intragroup conflict (De
Dreu and Weingart, 2003; Jehn and Bendersky, 2003) and, as such, have also found their way to
the entrepreneurship literature (e.g. Ensley et al., 2002; Forbes et al., 2010; Higashide and Birley,
2

<-----Page 2----->2002). We additionally study the impact of goal conflicts as these reflect actual (goal)
incompatibilities, contrary to task and relationship conflicts which pertain to perceived
incompatibilities. Early conflict scholars note that perceived and actual incompatibilities do not
necessarily coincide and that both have an important role to play in the conflict process (Cosier
and Rose, 1977; Deutsch, 1973; Thomas, 1976).

Building on recent advances in the exit literature (e.g. Brigham et al., 2007; DeTienne and
Cardon, 2010), we examine the effect of these three types of conflict on entrepreneurs‟ and angel
investors‟ exit intentions. These intentions have been shown to be reliable predictors of actual
exit (Brigham et al., 2007), which we corroborate by presenting empirical evidence based on a
follow-up study conducted one year after the initial round of data collection. As a result this
paper provides insight into the drivers of entrepreneurial and angel investor exit.

Taken together, we contribute to the entrepreneurship literature in two ways. First, this
study extends the theoretical understanding of entrepreneurial and investor exit by incorporating
the relationships in which they are embedded. By examining the effects of conflicts, it also
provides insight into the processes leading up to entrepreneurial (and investor) exit, as called for
by Ucbasaran, Lockett, Wright and Westhead (2003a). Second, this study is the first to examine
drivers of angel investor exit, a uniquely important issue as the ventures in which they tend to
invest are very early stage and sensitive to the consequences of angel investor exit. In doing so,
we provide a more textured understanding of the angel investment process as a whole.

The paper proceeds as follows. First, we discuss the literature on angel investor and
entrepreneurial exit and develop hypotheses relating conflict and intentions to exit (see figure 1
3

<-----Page 3----->for the conceptual model). Next, we describe the method used, followed by a presentation of the
findings. We then conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings and their
consequences to potential future research.

ANGEL INVESTOR AND ENTREPRENEURIAL EXIT: A SUMMARY

Entrepreneurial and investor exit is defined as “the process whereby founders
[/entrepreneurs] of [or investors in] privately-held firms . . . remove themselves from the primary
ownership and decision-making structures of the firm” (DeTienne, 2010, p.204).1 As these have
been the subject of separate streams of literature, we provide a summary of both.

Angel investor exit
For angel investors, their exit is part of the job with return maximization being one of the
objectives to achieve (Mason, 2006; Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007). Being a liquidity event, it
implies relinquishing financial ownership of the firm (Mason, 2006). While representing a crucial
event in their partnership with entrepreneurs, extant research on angel investor exit is scarce
(Mason, 2006; Mason and Harrison, 2002). What we do know, is limited to descriptive facts and
figures regarding how, when and with what return these investors exit.

Excluding failures, angel investors generally liquidate their investments through trade
sales or selling their shares to existing shareholders; initial public offerings (IPOs) on the other
1

In both cases we refer to exit from a particular deal, not from entrepreneurship or angel investing in general.
4

<-----Page 4----->hand are rare (Mason and Harrison, 2002; Mayer, 2002). Angel investor exit is often unplanned
and many angels do not have a clear exit route preference (Brettel, 2003; De Clercq et al., 2006).
On average, angel investors prefer to exit their portfolio companies between 4 to 7 years after
their initial investment, with about half of their investments resulting in break-even or losses and
one quarter in high returns (Freear et al., 2002; Mason and Harrison, 2002).

A potential explanation for the lack of research attention to angel investor exit in general
and its antecedents in specific is that older studies emphasized angel investors being much less
concerned about exiting than venture capitalists (e.g. Mayer, 2002; Van Osnabrugge, 2000),
making it less relevant to study in an angel investor setting. Recent developments in the angel
market, such as increased syndication and professionalization, have, however, made this claim
less applicable (Harrison and Mason, 2000; Sudek, 2004).

Angel investor exit also warrants more scholarly attention because it has profound
implications for portfolio companies, industry and economy as a whole. On a company level,
investor exit will likely have a bearing on the entrepreneur as he or she stands to regain or lose
control over the venture (Duxbury et al., 1996). Further, it may alter the gamut of resources
available to entrepreneurs and their ventures (Mason and Harrison, 2002). As angel investments
represent injections of human, social and financial resources into the respective ventures (Mason,
2006), their departure will likely amount to a drain of those same resources. Conversely, angel
investor departure can equal venture capitalist entry (Harrison and Mason, 2000), resulting in a
replenishment of resources. On a higher level, investor exits through acquisitions or IPOs can
affect competition and other dynamics of the industry in which the portfolio company operates
(e.g. Akhigbe et al., 2006). Finally, exits can free up time and financial resources which the angel
5

<-----Page 5----->investor can reinvest in other entrepreneurial ventures (Van Osnabrugge, 1998), thereby
continuing to contribute to the economy.

Entrepreneurial exit
For entrepreneurs, exit requires relinquishing psychological in addition to financial
ownership of the firm (DeTienne, 2010). Although much younger in tradition, research on
entrepreneurial exit is similar to investor exit literature in terms of the variety of perspectives
adopted, levels of analysis studied and the multidimensionality of the phenomenon itself.
Whereas early research had generally equated entrepreneurial exit with firm exit, DeTienne
(2010) argues for entrepreneurial exit warranting a separate research approach as each individual
entrepreneur is characterized by his or her own, unique intentions (Bird, 1988). Hence, while exit
of the individual entrepreneur or founder might coincide with exit of the firm at large, e.g. in case
of one-man-companies, one needs to disentangle firm from entrepreneurial exit.

Entrepreneurs, much like their investors, can leave their ventures through a wide variety
of mechanisms. They can leave their ventures voluntarily or involuntarily, they can disband the
venture or sell it to third parties, employees or family members, or their ventures can fail (Bates,
2005; Birley and Westhead, 1993; Petty, 1997). When narrowing down the literature to the
likelihood and intentions of entrepreneurs to exit their ventures (in terms of when and how),
scholars have revealed the impact of the rate of technological change (Crifo and Sami, 2008),
income tax rates (Gurley-Calvez and Bruce, 2008), company performance and capital flows into
the company (Bates, 2005; Gimeno et al. 1997; Headd, 2003; Wennberg et al., 2010), the
entrepreneurial team‟s heterogeneity (Ucbasaran et al., 2003a) and the entrepreneur‟s human

6

<-----Page 6----->capital (Bates, 2005; DeTienne and Cardon, 2010; Gimeno et al., 1997; Headd, 2003; Wennberg
et al., 2010).

While for some entrepreneurs exit marks the end of their entrepreneurial careers (Dyer,
1994), for others, called habitual or serial entrepreneurs, it is merely the beginning of a new
adventure (Ucbasaran et al., 2003b). Not only does exit hence have huge implications for the
entrepreneur concerned, it also has important implications on company, industry and economy
level. On a company level, entrepreneurial exit may lead to an increase in resources and skills
available, while also potentially resulting in decreased employee morale and performance.
Industry effects are similar to those of investor exits as they pertain to the exit mechanism rather
than the position of the exiting individual. Finally, entrepreneurial exit may affect the overarching
economy through entrepreneurial recycling (for a more comprehensive discussion of these
effects, see DeTienne, 2010).

Angel investor and entrepreneurial exit: the importance of relationships
In summary, both entrepreneurial and angel investor exits are important and deserving of
our research attention. For both types of exit though the literature has been largely negligent of
the relationship with key stakeholders. For angel investors, who tend to be personally involved
with the ventures in which they invest and who bring their own unique motivations, intentions,
experience and personality to the table (Freear et al., 2002; Mason, 2006), taking into account the
interpersonal dynamics with entrepreneurs seems crucial. Similarly, from an entrepreneur‟s
perspective, taking into account conflict with key stakeholders, like angel investors, should
provide insight into their intention to exit.

7

<-----Page 7----->HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT

In an average angel-backed company, angel investors and entrepreneurs are dependent on
each other in that they make a deal to trade the angel investor‟s human, social and financial
capital for the opportunity or potential to make financial gains (Mason, 2006; Yitshaki, 2008).
This partnership hence requires exchanges among investors and entrepreneurs that facilitate a
deeper understanding of each other‟s goals, needs, values and viewpoints and endorse a
cooperative working relationship (Cable and Shane, 1997; Harrison et al., 1997; Politis, 2008).
As with similar types of exchange relationships (e.g. Amason and Schweiger, 1997; De Clercq et
al., 2009), conflict is unavoidable in such settings (Mason and Harrison, 1996). Conflict is
generally defined as “perceived incompatibilities or discrepant views among the parties involved”
(Jehn and Bendersky, 2003, p. 189), with a distinction traditionally made between relationship
and task conflicts (De Dreu and Weingart, 2003; Jehn, 1995). In the setting of angel-financed
ventures, relationship conflicts pertain to perceived interpersonal incompatibilities or personality
clashes between angel investors and entrepreneurs. Task conflicts, on the other hand, refer to
perceived disagreements between angel investors and entrepreneurs about what should be done.
Although task and relationship conflicts often occur together, empirical evidence does
corroborate them both representing distinct dimensions of intragroup conflict (De Dreu and
Weingart, 2003; Jehn and Bendersky, 2003).

In organizational behaviour literature it is widely accepted that relationship conflicts
among team members are important predictors of their individual intentions to leave their teams
and their subsequent turnover behaviour (Jehn and Bendersky, 2003). Studies focusing on
relationship conflicts have consistently supported it to be detrimental to morale (Bayazit and
8

<-----Page 8----->Mannix, 2003; Jehn, 1995; Jehn et al., 1999; Medina et al., 2005). Its personal nature causes
feelings of anger, stress, anxiety, avoidance, suspicion, cynicism and animosity with the parties
involved (Amason, 1996; Jehn, 1995; Pelled, 1996). A substantive amount of literature has
further shown that individuals do not generally enjoy the experience of personal attacks,
criticisms and the along-going bad feelings. As such, relationship conflicts will lead to a general
feeling of dissatisfaction and thus increase individuals‟ intentions to leave the team or company
(Bayazit and Mannix, 2003; Jehn, 1995; Medina et al., 2005). A similar effect is expected for
relationship conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs.

Upon investment angel investors and entrepreneurs enter their partnership with certain
expectations and assumptions. One of those is a good fit between investors and entrepreneurs, as
this is one of the most important investment criteria for angel investors, more so than for venture
capitalists (Mason, 2006; Mason and Stark, 2004). Even in the latter setting though, fit has also
been shown to matter as investors prefer entrepreneurs who are like them, both in terms of
surface-level attributes such as professional background (Franke et al., 2006) and deeper-lying
attributes such as cognitive reasoning processes (Murnieks et al., 2007). Further, entrepreneurs
expect their angel investors to deliver several services once the investment has been made, such
as serving as a sounding board (Mason, 2006; Sudek, 2004). For this reason, they are often
advised to think twice about whom to bring on board (Duxbury et al., 1996; Mason and Harrison,
1996). Angel investors‟ more active involvement in the venture post-investment combined with
their desire to help fellow entrepreneurs generally results in a relationship of a more personal
nature than is the case for the average VC partnership (Landström, 1998; Sudek, 2004). This
makes investor-entrepreneur fit an even more crucial requirement for a successful, cooperative
relationship between angel investors and entrepreneurs.
9

<-----Page 9----->Hence, when post-investment investors and entrepreneurs become aware of their
(unanticipated) differences in personalities, political norms, values and taste, disappointment will
result. Interpersonal dislikes and associated feelings of resentment and animosity will not only
make entrepreneurs and angel investors disillusioned about their perfect marriage, it will also
undermine their cooperation by hindering their capability to gather and process information from
each other – crucial for the success of their exchange relationship – and by focusing on the
emotional problems rather than on the tasks at hand (Amason, 1996; Bayazit and Mannix, 2003;
Jehn, 1995). As typical responses to interpersonal problems include “psychological and physical
withdrawal” (Jehn, 1995, p. 258), these conflicts should increase investors‟ and entrepreneurs‟
intentions to exit their ventures. Considering the importance of interpersonal fit between investors
and entrepreneurs to enable active and valuable post-investment interaction between them, we
expect this effect to hold for both angel investors and entrepreneurs. Thus,

H1a: Higher levels of relationship conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs will
increase entrepreneurs’ intention to exit their ventures.
H1b: Higher levels of relationship conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs will
increase angel investors’ intention to exit their portfolio companies.

Previous empirical studies on the relationship between task conflict and intentions to exit
have suggested that it should have no effect in settings where tasks embody a certain degree of
complexity, such as strategic decision making, as this would be inherent to the task and hence to
be expected (Bayazit and Mannix, 2003; Jehn, 1995; Jehn et al., 1999). Since angel investors and
entrepreneurs are key strategic decision agents, one could expect the same effect for their task

10

<-----Page 10----->conflicts. While we follow this line of reasoning for task conflicts‟ lack of effect on angel
investors‟ intentions to exit, we expect a positive effect on entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit.

Entrepreneurs have a strong sense of psychological ownership over and emotional
attachment to their ventures (Pierce et al., 2001), even after receiving external equity funding
(Arthurs and Busenitz, 2003). They have generally invested substantial amounts of sweat equity
into their ventures, have nurtured and developed it from idea inception onwards and have a firm
idea of where to take it next (Arthurs and Busenitz, 2003; Forbes et al., 2010). As such, they
generally prefer investors whom they suspect will help them in guiding their venture towards
achieving those ultimate goals (Boot et al., 2006). They tend to welcome and are receptive to
investor advice on how to achieve their vision, although the degree to which varies among
entrepreneurs (Barney et al., 1996). However, being confronted with a lot of task conflicts might
create the opposite impression, making entrepreneurs believe investors are working against rather
than with them. Entrepreneurs will be more likely to no longer see the investor‟s input as wellintentioned advice and perceive their conflicts, considering their strategic importance to the
venture and its future, as threatening (Avey et al., 2009). In addition, they could interpret these
disagreements as investors questioning their ability, judgment and contributions to the venture.
Feeling pressured by external constituents, such as investors, entrepreneurs are likely to become
less committed to their ventures (Dobrev and Barnett, 2005). Taken together, this should make
entrepreneurs more susceptible to feelings of fear and distrust, making them less satisfied with
their investor relationship and leading to detachment and withdrawal.

Angel investors, on the other hand, will frame these disagreements rather differently.
„Suffering‟ less from emotional bonds to the venture, they will likely see these discussions as part
11

<-----Page 11----->of normal business (Mason and Harrison, 1996; Politis, 2008). Angel investors see it as their job
to probe entrepreneurs to help them find and formalize a vision, without realising the effects this
might have on the entrepreneur‟s self-confidence and commitment. To this end, some have even
developed formal planning tools, such as questionnaires (see, for instance, Berkus, 2006). As
such, debate is innate to their task or job of being an advisor and investor, cancelling out task
conflict‟s potential negative effects (Bayazit and Mannix, 2003). Taken together, we hypothesize:

H2a: Higher levels of task conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs will increase
entrepreneurs’ intention to exit their ventures.
H2b: Task conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs will have no effect on angel
investors’ intention to exit their portfolio companies.

Thus far, we have focused on conflicts as perceived incompatibilities (Jehn and
Bendersky, 2003). A common assumption made when investigating the effect of such perceived
incompatibilities is that team members have common goals (Jehn, 1995). However, this
assumption does not necessarily hold for angel investors and entrepreneurs. Even though they are
united by an overarching goal of value creation, angel investors and entrepreneurs can namely
have quite different subgoals (Fiet, 1995; Mason, 2006; Politis, 2008). For example, angel
investors who want to maximize financial gains (Mason, 2006; Sudek, 2004) are likely to be
more focused on short-term growth and development than their respective entrepreneurs (De
Clercq and Manigart, 2007).

Goal incompatibilities, also labelled goal conflicts (Bourgeois, 1985; Cosier and Rose,
1977; Eisenhardt and Bourgeois, 1988), are related to task conflicts. Even stronger, goal conflicts
12

<-----Page 12----->were taken as a starting point to Jehn‟s definition of team task conflict (Jehn, 1997, p. 532).
While related, these conflict types differ in two important respects. First, whereas goal conflicts
pertain to actual goal incompatibilities, task conflicts include, but are not limited to, perceived
goal incompatibilities (Jehn, 1997). Being key strategic decision agents, task conflicts between
angel investors and entrepreneurs refer to strategic decisions to be taken, which is broader than
setting objectives (Eisenhardt and Bourgeois, 1988). Second and more importantly, conflict
scholars acknowledge that perceptions can be misguiding in that perceived incompatibilities will
not necessarily reflect actual incompatibilities, nor will actual incompatibilities necessarily be
perceived as such (Deutsch, 1973; Fisher, 1998; Thomas, 1976). Even entrepreneurship scholars
recognize that perceived goal incompatibilities do not necessarily correspond with actual goal
incompatibilities (Arthurs and Busenitz, 2003). Given these differences and the key role goal
incompatibilities play in investor-entrepreneur settings, we included goal conflicts in this study. 2

Previous research indicated that goal conflicts increase the likelihood of using competitive
tactics and will make problem-solving more difficult (Deutsch, 1973; Eisenhardt and Bourgeois,
1988; Fisher, 1998; Tjosvold, 1998). When angel investors and entrepreneurs truly and
substantially differ in terms of the actual objectives they want to achieve, the probability of
finding a compromise and forging a cooperative relationship will thus significantly decrease
(Apfelbaum, 1974; Cable and Shane, 1997). This could lead investors and entrepreneurs to no

2

Distinguishing this approach from the cooperative and competitive goal approach adopted by Tjosvold and his
colleagues, is the fact that they define cooperative and competitive goals as the perception thereof. In other words,
when team members perceive their goals to be positively or cooperatively linked, conflicts can be constructive to
team effectiveness through increased mutual trust, positive attitudes towards other team members and open-minded
debate (Deutsch, 1973; Tjosvold, 1998). Perceptions of competitively or negatively linked goals on the other hand
will lead to the opposite. Furthermore, this approach is also distinct from goal conflict as referred to by Higashide
and Birley (2002) as they do not conceptualize, nor measure this concept as actual goal incompatibilities.
13

<-----Page 13----->longer seeing any mutual gain from continuing their partnership, thereby making it less desirable
and useful for them to remain with their companies (Christensen et al., 2009).

We expect this positive effect of goal conflicts on intentions to exit to hold for both angel
investors and entrepreneurs. Even though mixed goals are inherent to their partnership, a certain
degree of goal alignment is a conditio sine qua non for both parties to enter into and achieve a
successful cooperation (Brettel, 2003; Politis, 2008). Angel investors, being particularly
concerned with agency risk (Fiet, 1995), will not invest unless they are convinced a minimum
threshold of goal alignment is present. In other words, whereas some discussion concerning
actions to be taken, resources to be committed (Mintzberg, 1976, p. 246) and other crucial,
strategic discussions is to be expected, investors do not expect their underlying goals to be very
different from the entrepreneurs‟. Similarly, entrepreneurs, not being very experienced with the
process of gathering financing, often do not have a clear view on investors‟ requirements,
characteristics and objectives (Van Auken, 2001). It is hence likely that they will also, at least
initially, expect a certain degree of goal alignment to be present. As for both angel investors and
entrepreneurs highly incongruent goals are undesirable and unexpected, the hypotheses are:

H3a: Higher levels of goal conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs will increase
entrepreneur’s intention to exit their ventures.
H3b: Higher levels of goal conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs will increase
angel investor’s intention to exit their portfolio companies.

<-----Page 14----->METHODS

Sample and data collection
Data for this study were gathered in two locations, Continental Europe (Belgium) and
USA (California). For the Belgian sample, 20 different data sources were used including a
random directory of start-ups, deal lists of angel networks, GEM data3, directories of hightechnology companies, media articles, incubators and snowballing. This way a list of 305 Belgian
potential angel-backed companies was constructed, who were telephoned during the summer of
2007 in order to identify whether or not they fulfilled the conditions of the research. These
conditions were (1) at least one angel investor needed to be a member of the Board of Directors
or actively involved in strategic decision-making in their portfolio company and (2) the company
had to have received angel financing between January 2003 and August 2006. The latter
condition was imposed in order to avoid the exit period because conflict‟s effects can change as
teams approach the end of their relationship (Jehn and Mannix, 2001). In addition, focusing on
young angel investments should avoid recall and survival bias (Farrell et al., 2008; Paul et al.,
2007). This resulted in 64 (potentially) eligible companies.4 For the Californian sample, the data
sources included Zephyr, VentureXpert, Growthink and the members‟ or participants‟ lists from
the Angel Capital Association, C21 BioVentures and the California Clean Tech Open
competition. This resulted in a list of 1265 Californian potential angel-backed companies, who
were contacted through e-mails containing a link to a YouTube video in which the research
project and the above-mentioned conditions were explained by the lead researcher. Companies

During the data collection process for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in Belgium, an additional question was
asked to respondents as to whether or not they had made investments that were not family- or friend-related.
4
This includes companies that we were not able to contact and hence whose angel-backed nature could not be
verified.
15

<-----Page 15----->were asked to inform us of whether or not they fulfilled the research conditions, which resulted in
588 (potentially) eligible companies.

Responses were sought from all entrepreneurial team members and angel investors who
had a seat on the Board of Directors or were actively involved in the company. The
entrepreneurial team was defined as those individuals who, at the time of the study, had an equity
stake and were actively involved or played a key role in strategic decision making (Forbes et al.,
2006; Ucbasaran et al., 2003a). The definition used for angel investors was external individual
investors who invest some of their own wealth in unlisted companies in exchange for shares and
who have no family or friend connection to the entrepreneurs (Mason, 2006). When parties
agreed to participate, questionnaires were e-mailed either directly to the team members concerned
or, in some cases, through the CEO when angel investors preferred to remain anonymous. This
method of distributing surveys is consistent with previous team research (e.g. Simons et al., 1999;
Srivastava et al., 2006). When necessary, follow-up phone calls were performed. Using a team
member response rate criterion of 50% (e.g. Ensley et al., 2002; Mooney et al., 2007) and the
condition that at least one response was needed from the angel investor side and one from the
entrepreneurs‟ side, a final sample was obtained of 28 Belgian teams (representing 35 angel
investors and 40 entrepreneurs) and 26 Californian teams (representing 30 angel investors and 32
entrepreneurs).

Analyses revealed no significant differences between Belgian respondents and nonrespondents in terms of company age in 2007, age at time of investment and industry distribution.
The Californian respondents and non-respondents did not significantly differ in terms of
company age at time of investment and industry distribution, but ventures of non-respondents
16

<-----Page 16----->were older at the time of the research project. The latter is not surprising in that this research was
targeted towards younger angel investments. As angel investors often tend to invest in the earlier
stages of development (Mason, 2006), older, more mature companies would probably not have
fulfilled the second condition of this study and were hence more likely to not respond to the
survey request (547 out of 562 non-respondents could namely not be contacted). Finally, there
were no substantial differences between early and late respondents in both samples regarding the
primary variables of interest. Taken together, this indicates that non-response bias should be
limited (Armstrong and Overton, 1977).

As the number of respondents was rather small in both locations separately it was deemed
desirable to combine them into one larger sample. In order to do so a multigroup confirmatory
factor analysis was run to check for measurement invariance (Steenkamp and Baumgartner,
1998). The goodness-of-fit indices suggested by Hu and Bentler (1998) were all above the
minimum values (CFI= 0.96, TLI=0.95, SRMR=0.06). As such, this provided support for
combining the Belgian and Californian samples into one larger sample, consisting of 54 teams
and 137 individuals, of which 72 entrepreneurs and 65 angel investors.

Variables
Dependent variable. Intention to exit was measured using two items based on O‟Reilly et
al. (1991) and Brigham et al. (2007). The questions were “How long do you intend to remain
with Venture X?” and “If you have your own way, will you be working for this organization
three years from now?”. Both questions were slightly adapted for the angel investors (for the first
item “remain invested in” was added and “working for this organization” in the second item was
changed into “still be a shareholder”). As in Brigham et al. (2007), the two items were measured
17

<-----Page 17----->on a 7-point scale ranging from less than 1 year to more than 5 years for the first item and from
definitely yes to definitely no for the second item. The first item was reverse scored such that
higher scores indicated a higher intent to exit. For the final score the two items were averaged.
The mean value was 2.31 (st.dev. 1.36) for entrepreneurs and slightly higher, i.e. 3.02 (st.dev.
1.57) for angel investors. Both indicate a positive skew (for further details see section on
robustness checks). The Cronbach‟s alpha value was satisfactory (0.74). In order to validate this
measure, angel investors were also asked to explicitly formulate the number of years in which
they wanted to exit. The correlation coefficient with the intention to exit measure was negative
and statistically significant (-.61, p < .001), indicating construct validity. 5

Independent variables. Task conflict and relationship conflict were measured using three
items for each based on the revised version by Pearson et al. (2002) of Jehn‟s intragroup conflict
scale (Jehn, 1995). For task conflict, respondents were asked to rate how many disagreements
over different ideas, differences about the content of decisions and differences of opinion there
had been between the angel investors and entrepreneurs on a scale from 1 (= none) to 5 (= a great
deal). For relationship conflict, they were asked how much tension, personal friction and anger
there had been between the angel investors and the entrepreneurs. The mean value for task
conflict was 2.24 (st.dev. 0.72) and 1.80 (st.dev. 0.89) for relationship conflict. Both Cronbach‟s
alpha values indicated excellent reliability (0.92 and 0.93 respectively). In order to check whether
aggregation was appropriate, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-group
agreement index were calculated (James et al., 1984; Klein and Kozlowski, 2000). Both ICCs are
significant (p < .001) and the median Rwg(J) values for both constructs exceed the 0.7 threshold
(0.94 for both task and relationship conflict). This indicates that, per company, there is adequate

variation between companies. Together this justifies aggregation.6

Goal conflict was measured as the degree of goal incongruence based on Sapienza and
Gupta (1994). First, respondents were asked to allocate 200 points across 11 objectives (6
financial and 5 non-financial criteria) and this according to these criteria‟s importance to the
achievement of the short-term financial goals of Venture X. Second, they were asked how much
emphasis should be given to financial and non-financial goals respectively (percentage). For each
criterion a weighted score was then calculated. Illustration: new product development (NPD) is a
non-financial criterion. Assume the respondent allocated 20 out of 100 non-financial points to
this criterion and, in general, thinks that non-financial goals should be given 80% emphasis, then
the weighted score for NPD would equal 20x0.80. After this, the average of the weighted scores
per criterion was calculated for the two subgroups (i.e. angel investors and the entrepreneurs)
separately. Only then the absolute differences of the average weighted scores of the angel
investors and entrepreneurs within the same company were taken and summed across criteria.
The mean value was 76.57 (st.dev. 26.29). As a point of comparison, the average degree of goal
incongruence between VCs and CEOs in the study by Sapienza and Gupta (1994) was somewhat
higher, i.e. 93.92 (st.dev. 31.61).

Control variables. Besides relationship-specific factors such as conflicts, several other
aspects pertaining to angel investors, entrepreneurs or their ventures can influence exit in terms of
6

Median Rwg(J) values were also calculated based on triangular and moderately skewed distributions instead of the
generally used uniform null distribution (LeBreton and Senter, 2008). These values also all exceeded the 0.7
threshold, thus confirming adequate within-group agreement for aggregation. Since angel investors and
entrepreneurs could be argued to form subgroups within their overarching teams, aggregation statistics were
additionally calculated at the subgroup level. ICCs and Rwg(J) values all exceeded threshold values.
19

<-----Page 19----->its type, success and timing and hence potentially affect angel investors‟ and entrepreneurs‟
intentions to exit. Therefore, several controls were added for the entrepreneur and angel investor
models respectively.

For the entrepreneurs‟ intention to exit model, we added controls for industry, company
age, team size, the entrepreneur‟s age and his/her entrepreneurial and consulting experience. As
industries might vary in terms of competitive and technological environment, average
performance and exit opportunities (Bates, 2005; Gimeno et al., 1997), two industry dummy
variables were added. Specifically, one dummy variable was added for software (50%) and one
for high-tech manufacturing (17% of the sample), which together represented the two most
common industries in our sample. Based on other entrepreneurial exit studies (DeTienne and
Cardon, 2010; Wennberg et al., 2010), entrepreneurs were asked to indicate the founding year of
their venture so that company age at time of questioning could be calculated and controlled for.
Team size might also affect intragroup dynamics (Jehn, 1995; Simons et al., 1999) and the
probability of entrepreneurial exit (Boeker and Karichalil, 2002). Therefore, a variable was
included to control for team size, measured as the total number of entrepreneurs and angel
investors.7 In addition to being influenced by company- and team-level characteristics (Gimeno et
al., 1997; Ucbasaran et al., 2003a), entrepreneurial exit is also influenced by individual-level
features (DeTienne, 2010). An entrepreneur‟s human capital has been shown to influence exit
type or success (Bates, 2005; Headd, 2003; Wennberg et al., 2010), intended exit strategy
(DeTienne and Cardon, 2010) and exit likelihood in general (Gimeno et al., 1997; Headd, 2003).
Hence, we controlled for the entrepreneur‟s age (number of years) and his/her entrepreneurial
and consulting experience, all at time of questioning. Entrepreneurial experience was measured
7

As defined in accordance with sample requirements.
20

<-----Page 20----->by asking entrepreneurs the number of years working experience as founder or entrepreneur.
Additionally, we used number of years consulting experience as it adds to skills such as problem
detection, knowledge generation and dissemination as well as learning how to take advantage of
opportunities (Dimov and Shepherd, 2005; Walske and Zacharakis, 2009). Similar to the
traditionally studied human capital variables, such skills are valuable in business management
and help in making strategic business decisions, thereby increasing the probability of achieving
successful exits (Walske and Zacharakis, 2009; Zarutskie, 2010).

For the angel investors‟ intention to exit model, controls for industry, portfolio company
age, angel investor age, time since investment and perceived venture performance were added.
As industry dummies and portfolio company age have been shown to impact investor exit they
were included and measured in the same way as in the entrepreneur‟s model (Chahine et al.,
2007). Angel investor’s age was also added as a control variable because of its effect on turnover
likelihood (Bayazit and Mannix, 2003; Jehn, 1995). In addition, time since investment was
included as it could be related to exit success and likelihood (Mason and Harrison, 2002). Finally,
perceived firm performance (range 1-5) was also controlled for by asking respondents to rate the
current performance of the venture relative to its competitors (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994).
Considering angel investors‟ financial motives for investment making (Mason, 2006; Sudek,
2004), perceived venture performance could positively influence the nature of their relationship
with entrepreneurs as well as their intention to keep on investing in the company, just like for
venture capitalists (De Clercq and Sapienza, 2006). As this study aims to explain conflict‟s
effects on angel investors‟ intentions to exit their ventures over and above the venture‟s
performance, it was therefore deemed necessary to include it as a control variable. A quadratic
effect of perceived performance was also added, because one could argue that investors might
21

<-----Page 21----->have a higher intention to exit low- and high-performing ventures than moderately performing
ones (hence, a U-shaped relationship).

Data quality: common method bias
Since most of the variables used in the analyses were gathered through the same
questionnaire, concerns around common method variance might arise. Several aspects were taken
into account in designing the questionnaire as to reduce the risk of this potential bias, e.g. reverse
scoring of items, use of variation in wording of items, use of different scaling anchors for the key
variables and guaranteeing absolute anonymity to respondents (Lindell and Whitney, 2001;
Podsakoff et al., 2003). Further, all variables were measured using scales which had been
previously validated and shown to have good psychometric properties (see above). In addition to
the design of this study, the Harman‟s single factor test also suggests common method bias may
be limited (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). The exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 3-factor
solution, with the first factor accounting for only 34% of the total variance (and 31% and 13% for
the second and third factor respectively).

Further, intentions to exit should positively predict subsequent exit behaviour (Brigham et
al., 2007). In order to corroborate this, all entrepreneurs and angel investors from the original
sample were contacted again after one year. Excluding exits due to deaths (2 angel investors, 2
entrepreneurs), 16 individuals (7 angel investors and 9 entrepreneurs) had left their ventures.
Logistic regressions were run with the dependent variable taking the value 1 in case of
entrepreneur or angel investor exit and 0 for continuation.

*** Insert Table 1 about here ***
22

<-----Page 22----->Table 1 reveals that intentions to exit have a statistically significant, positive effect on
both investor (p < .05) and entrepreneur exit (p < .01). In unreported results, analyses were rerun
on specific exit types in order to account for exit multidimensionality (Wennberg et al., 2010).
High- versus low-performing exits was defined as exits where the pre-exit performance as
perceived by the CEO was above versus below the (sample) mean. The results indicate that
intentions to exit are also statistically significant predictors of sales exits, i.e. distress and harvest
sales, and high-performing exits, i.e. harvest sales as the sample did not include harvest
liquidations.8 Taken together, this suggests that the risk of common method bias is limited.

Data analysis
As angel investor and entrepreneurial exit might be driven by different factors, reflected
by the different control variables included in the respective models, separate OLS regressions
were run for the entrepreneur subsample (N=72) and the angel investor subsample (N=65).
Because we investigate the intentions to exit of investors and entrepreneurs belonging to the same
set of ventures, we employ the seemingly unrelated estimation procedure (SuEst in STATA
10.0). Similar to seemingly unrelated regression, this technique allows for correlated errors across
estimated equations or models by combining the estimation results into a single, simultaneous
covariance matrix (Weesie, 1999; StataCorp, 2007). Additionally, this procedure allows for
clustered standard errors per company (Weesie, 1999), a necessary correction as observations of
investors and entrepreneurs in our sample are non-independent. Finally, this estimation procedure
has the advantage of being statistically more efficient compared to running two separate OLS
regressions.
8

The number of low-performing, i.e. distress, exits was too low for the model to be able to run. However, statistical
results were stronger in the overall exit model than in the high-performing exit model (angel investor: p < .10;
entrepreneur: p < .05), which would suggest that intentions to exit are also reliable predictors of low-performing exit.
23

<-----Page 23----->RESULTS

Descriptive statistics
Table 2 provides an overview of the means, standard deviations and correlations between
company-, entrepreneur- and angel investor-specific variables. Variables with shared meaning
and values for angel investors and entrepreneurs, such as company age, industry and conflicts,
were labeled company-level variables and were based on the company-level sample size (N=54).
All entrepreneur- and investor-specific variables were measured at the individual level (based on
respective sample sizes of 72 and 65).

*** Insert Table 2 about here ***

While no statistically significant correlations are found between entrepreneurs‟ intentions
to exit and conflict, we do find statistically significant and positive correlations between angel
investors‟ intentions to exit and all conflict constructs. The correlation between task and goal
conflict is trivial and its 95% confidence interval ranges from -.28 to .26, corroborating that these
are indeed distinct concepts (MacKenzie et al., 2005). Further, the correlation between task and
relationship conflict is very high (.84) and statistically significant. Therefore, a confirmatory
factor analysis was conducted based on the entire sample (N=137) as task and relationship
conflicts are shared, team-level constructs. The two-factor model had a significant better fit than
the one-factor model (one-factor model: CFI = 0.85, GFI = 0.73, RMR = 0.07 compared to the
two-factor model: CFI = 0.98, GFI = 0.94, RMR = 0.04) and the Chi-square difference of 95.20
was significant at p < .001. Consistent with previous conflict studies (De Clercq et al., 2009;
Forbes et al., 2010), this confirms task and relationship conflict‟s discriminant validity. Variance
24

<-----Page 24----->inflation factors further corroborate the limited threat of multicollinearity (maximum values of
4.41 and 4.19 in the entrepreneur‟s and angel investor‟s models respectively).

Hypotheses testing
The results of the regression analyses with seemingly unrelated estimation for both
entrepreneurs‟ and angel investors‟ intentions to exit are reported in Table 3.

*** Insert Table 3 about here ***

In both models, we first entered the control variables (base model). For entrepreneurs‟
intention to exit, this reveals a statistically significant and positive effect of consulting
experience. For angel investors‟ intentions to exit, a strong, negative linear effect is revealed for
perceived performance. While the curvilinear term is also statistically significant, its significance
is weaker and does not hold in the full model. Furthermore, the turning point for the curvilinear
term is out-of-range (1.98 for the mean-centered perceived performance variable), corroborating
a linear effect. As ventures are better performing, angel investors thus have lower intentions to
exit. The results further indicate that angel investors whose portfolio companies operate in hightech manufacturing have a statistically significant higher intention to exit. Both base models were
statistically significant (for the entrepreneurs: R² = .22, p < .05; for the angel investors: R² = .50,
p < .001).

With regard to entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit, relationship conflicts (H1a), task conflicts
(H2a) and goal conflicts (H3a) were hypothesized to have a positive effect above and beyond the
impact of the control variables. The full model in table 3 reveals statistically significant and
25

<-----Page 25----->positive effects for task (p < .01) and goal conflict (p < .05), but not for relationship conflict. This
provides support for hypotheses H2a and H3a, but not for H1a. Adding these conflict predictors
made a significant contribution over and above the base model (Δ R² = .07, p < .05).

For angel investors, a positive effect on intentions to exit was hypothesized for
relationship (H1b) and goal conflicts (H3b), while task conflicts were expected to have no effect
(H2b). Similar to entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit, we found no statistically significant effect of
relationship conflicts on angel investors‟ intentions to exit. Hence, hypothesis 1b could not be
supported. Further, the results reveal a statistically significant and positive effect of goal conflict
(p < .01) and no statistically significant effect for task conflict, which supports hypotheses H2b
and H3b. The addition of the predictor variables to the base model adds significant explanatory
power to the angel investor‟s intention to exit model (Δ R² = .09, p < .01).

Robustness checks
Several additional analyses were performed to check the robustness of these results. First,
based on previous research (Gimeno et al., 1997), one could argue that perceived venture
performance will also influence entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit. Therefore, models were rerun
adding perceived performance as a control variable to the entrepreneurial model (both in linear
and linear plus quadratic form). In both cases, the previous results remained robust, perceived
performance did not have a statistically significant effect on entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit and
model fit did not significantly improve. Second, controls were added to both angel investor and
entrepreneur models for location of data collection (Belgium or California), investment stage and
industry-specific experience (measured as the number of years working experience in the same
industry as the current venture/portfolio company). Adding a country dummy would not only
26

<-----Page 26----->control for any potential cultural differences in conflict-intention to exit relationships, it would
also serve as a proxy for potential differences in the development of the respective risk capital
markets and the availability of exit options. Similar to industry, investment stage might be related
to different exit types (Mason and Harrison, 2002; Wiltbank, 2005). Finally, industry-specific
experience has been shown to affect intended exit strategy (DeTienne and Cardon, 2010) and exit
type (Wennberg et al., 2010; Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007). However, none of these additional
control variables had a statistically significant effect nor did they improve model fit. Results
remained robust. Further, models were also run on a transformed, i.e. squared, version of the
intention to exit variable as this was highly skewed. Again this did not alter the results. Finally,
having no information on exit agreements made between angel investors and entrepreneurs at the
time of investment, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of having included conflicts
about exit. To address this concern, we reran the main analyses excluding all ventures (11) from
which respondents subsequently, i.e. one year later, left. Results were slightly stronger for both
investor and entrepreneur models, indicating that the risk of inflated findings as a consequence of
having included such conflicts should be limited.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present study, we set out to explain how conflicts between angel investors and
entrepreneurs affect both parties‟ intentions to exit. Building on conflict literature, we argued and
found that task conflicts between angel investors and entrepreneurs positively affect
entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit their ventures and goal conflicts positively affect both
entrepreneurs‟ and angel investors‟ intentions to exit. Their relationship conflicts, however, do
not affect intentions to exit. These findings are of interest for several reasons.
27

<-----Page 27----->First, this paper is among the first to integrate relational dynamics among venture partners
into the study of entrepreneurial and investor exits. Extant research on entrepreneurial exit has
revealed the impact of individual-, team-, company- and industry-level attributes on intended exit
strategy, exit likelihood and exit type. Research on antecedents of angel investor exit is lacking
altogether. What both streams of literature have in common is that they cannot provide an answer
to the question what processes lead up to entrepreneurial and investor exit nor how stakeholders
affect entrepreneurs and investors desiring to leave their ventures. By providing evidence of
entrepreneur-investor conflicts positively affecting intentions to exit, we uncover the impact of
behavioral processes at play between entrepreneurs (or investors) and one of their key
stakeholders, i.e. their financiers (or investees). In doing so, we contribute to the literature that
seeks to understand the driving forces of entrepreneurial and angel investor exit.

Second, this study addresses a call for opening up the investor-investee dyad (Lockett et
al., 2006). Thus far, research studying the post-investment relationship between angel investors
and entrepreneurs has focused on both parties‟ expectations regarding their partnership and the
roles angel investors take on in their portfolio companies (e.g. Brettel, 2003; Mason and
Harrison, 1996). Little to no research, however, has studied the working relationship of active
entrepreneur-angel investor „pairs‟. Considering angel investors and entrepreneurs generally
work together for a time period ranging between four and seven years, this lack of research
attention is surprising. While research on investment decision-making processes of angel
investors is certainly valuable and rewarding, it provides little insight into what happens once the
investment decision has been made. Our findings suggest that conflicts between angel investors
and entrepreneurs can substantially increase the likelihood of either one exiting prematurely. This

28

<-----Page 28----->indicates that if scholars want to thoroughly understand the angel investment process, from start
to end, one cannot overlook the relational aspects of the angel investor-entrepreneur partnership.

In addition, entrepreneurial finance research has generally adopted an exclusive investor
or entrepreneur perspective. By integrating both perspectives, we add to this literature in two
ways. While gathering data from just one side of investor-investee dyads is often considered a
limitation of the study concerned (e.g. Parhankangas and Landström, 2006), our findings suggest
that the distortion of doing so might be more limited than previously thought. Evidence regarding
aggregation statistics namely indicates that angel investors and entrepreneurs strongly agree in
terms of the degree of conflict present in their partnership. Thus, if one‟s worry regarding
collecting data on behavioral processes within the investor-investee dyad from only one side of
that dyad is that it might not provide a reliable view of what is really going on, our findings
suggest that this is uncalled for. However, gathering both partners‟ perceptions of their relational
dynamics does allow for a more comprehensive view on their partnership. By providing specific
evidence of how shared goal conflicts affect both angel investors‟ and entrepreneurs‟ intentions
to exit, while task conflicts only affect entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit, this research provides a
finer-grained insight into the specificity and unique nature of each of these parties involved.

Third, our study also informs conflict literature. While task and relationship conflict are
commonly studied in intragroup conflict research (De Dreu and Weingart, 2003), including in
entrepreneurship settings (e.g. Ensley et al., 2002; Higashide and Birley, 2002), goal conflicts are
not. By examining these three types of conflicts, this study ties into a debate that has gained
momentum in the intragroup conflict literature, namely that of how to define conflict (Tjosvold,
2007). Our results support the view that both perceived and actual incompatibilities (as in task
29

<-----Page 29----->and goal conflicts) should be considered important as both have a unique, significant role to play
in the conflict process. Theorizing conflict to consist of both a perceptual and an actual
component could provide an alternative lens on why conflict studies have produced so many
mixed findings (De Dreu and Weingart, 2003; Jehn and Bendersky, 2003). While early conflict
theorists defined conflict to include both perceived and actual incompatibilities (Deutsch, 1973),
conflict studies over the years have neglected this distinction, hence potentially confounding their
results. Incorporating both elements into future research should allow us to gain a better insight
into the complex relationship between conflict and team effectiveness and could reunite
researchers debating on whether conflict in teams and organizations should be stimulated or
avoided all together (Tjosvold, 2007).

Limitations, future research and implications
This study is not without its limitations, which provide opportunities for future research.
First, data were collected in two geographic locations (California and Belgium) and pooled based
on the results from the multigroup CFA. An argument could be made that differences in degree of
development of their respective risk capital markets could have an impact on the degree of
professionalization of angel investors and entrepreneurs as well as on their exit opportunities. As
such, it could influence the relationship under study. Although the USA and Western-European
countries are both known to have rather individualistic cultures, it would be interesting to see
whether there are cross-cultural differences in conflict‟s impact in the angel investor-entrepreneur
relationship. This was however beyond the scope of this paper. Furthermore, additional controls
for country were insignificant and did not change the results, indicating that this bias should not
be large.

30

<-----Page 30----->Second, one might argue that desiring to leave a venture does not necessarily equate being
able or willing to do so due to financial or legal restrictions. With regard to the former, angel
investors may only exit if it is financially attractive to do so through, for instance, an IPO or by
selling their shares to an interested party (Mason and Harrison, 2002; Birley and Westhead,
1993). Exit likelihood or desirability is, however, not an exclusive function of the potential
financial return achieved as angel investors are driven by a wide range of motivations and
objectives, including non-financial ones (Mason, 2006). Even if angel investors would be willing
to sell their shares at zero dollar value, one could argue that there might also be contractual
covenants limiting their ability to do so. Research has however indicated that angel investor
contracts generally do not include exit provisions (Kelly and Hay, 2003). In other words, while
potentially suboptimal from a financial point of view, angel investors should be able to exit if
they really want to. The statement that they generally will in case of high intentions to exit is
corroborated by the fact that these intentions are a form of psychological detachment from the
venture, increasing the likelihood of individuals actually leaving (Bayazit and Mannix, 2003;
Burris et al., 2008). To accurately reflect this on an empirical level, wording of the intention to
exit measure was altered to emphasize the voluntary aspect of the question and perceived venture
performance was taken into account. In addition, intentions to exit were significantly and
positively related to turnover, both for entrepreneurs and angel investors, indicating that the
problem of them not being able to exit should be limited.

One could also argue that our intention to exit measure does not take into account the
multidimensionality of entrepreneurial, and hence potentially, angel investor exit (Wennberg et
al., 2010; DeTienne, 2010). As we do not have data on intended exit strategy or on exit
agreements made prior to investment, this is indeed a limitation of our study. We tried to reduce
31

<-----Page 31----->this bias by controlling for factors that have been to shown to influence type of investor or
entrepreneurial exit or intended exit strategy. In addition, analyses indicated that angel investors‟
and entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit were statistically significant predictors of actual exit and this
for the overall sample of exits (distress liquidations, distress sales and harvest sales), for sales
exits only and for all high-performing exits only. Further, previous research has also indicated
that angel investors often do not have a clear exit strategy preference (e.g. Brettel, 2003).
Together, this should provide more confidence in our results holding regardless the type of exit
strategy, planned or unplanned.

On a similar note, by sampling active angel investors and entrepreneurs, we could be
missing the worst-case scenarios, those where angel investors and/or entrepreneurs have already
voluntarily left. While we acknowledge this limitation, we believe that, based on our theoretical
arguments, incorporating these companies into our sample would have only served to strengthen
the negative results found in this study.

Finally, one could criticize adopting a conflict theory approach to investor exit as angel
investors are assumed to invest with an intention to exit. Whereas exit should be a desirable
outcome for them to achieve, implying it to be a choice (excluding bankruptcies), organizational
behaviour literature frames it as an undesirable one, with conflict implying a push towards and
hence an obligation to exit. Nonetheless, we argue that our approach is appropriate for two
reasons. First, by focusing on young angel investments (maximum four years old) for whom exit
should not be an issue yet, the exits included in our sample should mainly be premature. Second,
if exits were desirable, one would expect a positive correlation between conflict and angel
investor satisfaction. Based on unreported results, in our sample, this was not the case for any of
32

<-----Page 32----->the conflict constructs under examination. Taken together, we believe this corroborates viewing
conflict leading up to angel investor exit as a push-relationship.

Based on the results and limitations of this study, there are several avenues for future
research. First, the main explanation provided for the results found for task and goal conflicts is
linked to the entrepreneur‟s psychological ownership over the venture, combined with
expectations concerning the angel investor-entrepreneur partnership (task conflicts being
expected from an investor‟s perspective, but not so for goal conflicts). Whereas the results are in
line with the hypothesized relationships, more research is needed in order to confirm its
underlying mechanisms. Future research is also needed to explain the lack of effect for
relationship conflicts. Considering the importance of fit in the angel investor-entrepreneur
relationship, we expected this to play a huge role in their intentions to exit, but the results did not
confirm this. Do they not care whether or not they get along? Is there only a minimum of fit
needed for this partnership to work? Second, this study should serve as a first step to further
extend investor and entrepreneurial exit frameworks to include the context or setting that
surrounds them. While this study revealed the importance of conflict dynamics, important factors
to be included in future studies could be other behavioral processes such as cohesion, potency
and efficacy as well as power distribution, communication processes or the degree of fit or match
between investors and entrepreneurs. Finally, while the focus of this paper was on angel
investors, it would be interesting to see to what extent the findings of this study apply to other
stakeholders, such as family members and venture capitalists. The latter are generally considered
to be more rational (professional) than their angel investing counterparts. Therefore, one would
implicitly assume that relational aspects would matter less in their exit decision-making process.
In contrast, several studies have already indicated that even VCs are not always the rational
33

<-----Page 33----->decision-making agents we make them out to be (e.g. Franke et al., 2006) and are hence also
subject to „flaws‟ inherent to humans such as biases and interpersonal dynamics.

Finally, this paper also has several practical implications. These findings suggest that both
entrepreneurs and angel investors should pay careful attention to conflicts that might arise
between them. Most important in this regard is when the objectives of the angel investors and
entrepreneurs diverge too much. This might result in the exit of one or both parties, which, if
prematurely, is less than desirable for both. Having highly aligned goals from the very start,
being clear about these goals and upholding goal alignment throughout their entire relationship
should substantially reduce the likelihood of goal conflicts arising subsequently. Further, it is
important for both investors and entrepreneurs to recognize that, while their relationship
represents a business partnership, they are still dealing with human beings, not robots or moneydispensing machines. Angel investors, who tend to rely heavily on their entrepreneurs to bring
the venture to a good end (Fiet, 1995), should carefully craft their post-investment venture
involvement as to not intimidate entrepreneurs. While it might be well-intentioned advice,
entrepreneurs could perceive it as meddling, making them feel threatened. To avoid these
potentially deleterious effects, entrepreneurs and angel investors might want to consider the
importance of crafting a setting where debate is open-minded and welcomed (Jehn and
Bendersky, 2003).

Conclusion
Representing the end of their partnership, exiting from their ventures is a key event for
both angel investors and entrepreneurs. While generally treated separately, this paper votes for
integrating these literatures by focusing on the angel investor-investee dyad and its potentially
34

<-----Page 34----->dysfunctional dynamics, i.e. conflict. We show that goal conflicts between angel investors and
entrepreneurs positively affect both parties‟ intentions to exit their ventures and task conflicts
additionally increase entrepreneurs‟ intentions to exit. Thus, this study extends the
entrepreneurial and investor exit literature by addressing three neglected areas: (1) by integrating
and corroborating the importance of the relationships entrepreneurs and angel investors develop
with each other, i.e. their key partners or stakeholders, (2) by shedding more light on the
behavioral processes that lead up to entrepreneurial and investor exit and (3) by examining the
effect of shared group processes on entrepreneurial and angel investor intentions to exit
separately, thereby providing a view on the unique character of both.

Exit events include harvest sales, distress sales and distress liquidations (as defined by Wennberg et al., 2010) and
exclude exits due to deaths. Our sample did not include harvest liquidations. Regression coefficients reported as well
as their respective significance levels are based on seemingly unrelated post-estimation analyses of the entrepreneur
and investor logit models, with standard errors being clustered at the company level (52 clusters).

As the high-tech variable predicts failure perfectly Stata dropped 10 observations.

a
The correlations between the company- and individual-level variables were calculated using N=72 for the entrepreneur-specific variables (variables 8 through
11) and using N=65 for the angel investor-specific variables (variables 12 through 15). To do so, the company-level scores were assigned down to the individuals
within those companies. As the company-level variables are common for the entrepreneur and investor subsamples, these were mentioned only once and were
calculated based on all companies or N=54.
b
Correlation coefficients between team size (variable 4) and angel investor-specific variables are not included in the investor part of the correlation matrix as this
variable will not be included in the final investor model (see Table 3).
