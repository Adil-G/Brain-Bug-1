firms andfirms totally dependent on manufacturing provide

more than 50% of the jobs in the United States and other industrialized

nations. In spite of the belief that the United States has become an
“information economy, ” it has recently been recognized by researchers,
politicians and industry experts that the loss of America’s leadership
position in manufacturing threatens the American industrial position. In
addition, small firms provided most of the job growth in the decade of the 80s and the most innovation
and new products.
The impact of these factors indicates the importance of determining what it takes to be successful
as a manufacturing entrepreneur. Beyond the importance to the national economy of understanding the
success-related factors in manufacturing entrepreneurship, several stakeholder categories have a
vested interest in this information as well. Job creation, job growth and economic development become
major agem!a items in the 1992 presidential campaign. Also, investors would like to have a model of
small firm growth on which to base their investments in start-up jirms. Finally, political units are
looking for mechanisms to create much-needed new jobs to provide tax revenue.
The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine the relationship between eight literature-based
predictor variables and employment growth in entrepreneurial manufacturing firms and (2) attempt to
develop a meaningful linear model, incorporating as many significant variables as possible from the
original eight that would explain variance in3rm performance.

The focus of this study was 327 manufacturing entrepreneurs located in the Tulsa Metropolitan
Statistical Area and 13 contiguous counties in East Te~as.~anufacturi~~ entrepreneurs were defined as
the founders of the~r~r~. The firms included in the study were aft less than ten years ofd, ~~epe~ent
(nat a division ofsome other firm) and had primary SIC codes between 2000 and3999. Usable responses
to a mail survey were 103, a 3iS%response
rate.
Results of this study suggest that age {of the entrepreneur) at founding, entrepreneurial
management experience, industry experience and environmental scanning practices are significantly
correlated with firm performance as measured by employment growth.

INTRODUCTION
The vitality of our domestic manufacturing

firms is of critical importance to the future
well-being of the U.S. economy (Dertouzos, Lester and Solow 1989; Hayes and Wheelwright
1984). Small, entrepreneurial
manufactu~ng
firms in particular have contributed disproportionately to economic growth but have received scant research attention. These firms have
historically evidenced greater employment growth and technological advancement than their
large, established counterparts (Birch 1987). The imperative, therefore, is to understand what
factors are associated with the growth and development of these firms.
Given the concern over employment and the strident demands for job creation, the
related issue of percentage increases in empIoyment at entrepreneurial manufacturing
firms
becomes an important popular issue as well. Political entities are, almost unifo~ly,
more
interested in job creation than in typical accounting measures of success for individual firms
(Miner, Smith and Bracker 1989). In response to this interest, this study determines the
correlates
of performance
(as measured
by employment
growth) for a sample of
entrepreneurial
manufacturing tirms.
In spite of the interest, relatively few recent empirical studies have used entrepreneu~al
manufactu~ng
firms as the target frame (Box 1991). Although several conceptual models of
small firm growth (Carsrud, Olm and Eddy 1985; Greenberger and Sexton 1987) exist, there
is no definitive model of entrepreneurial firm performance based on empirical observations
(Keats and Bracker 1988). This study begins the process of building a model of firm
performance by testing relationships between manufacturing
entrepreneurs’
personalities,
experience and environmental
scanning practices and the performance of their firms.

BACKGROUND
Although there is some confusion with respect to the question, “What is an entrepreneur?”
(Carland, Hoy and Carland 1988), there seems to be a growing awareness of the economic
importance of entrepreneurship
(U.S. Small Business Adminis~ation
1988). Historically,
many possible predictors of entrepreneurial performance have been proffered in the literature.
Among them are the background of the entrepreneur (age at founding, years of education,
start-up and industrial experience), psychological differences (Need for Achievement and
Locus of Control), and environmental
scanning practices. Age and education have been
positively related to firm performance (Birley and Norburn 1987; Hisrich and Brush 1984;
Hoad and Rosko 1964; Neisw~der and Dollinger 1986) and venture capitalists reportedly use
age as a screening criteria (Sandberg 1984; Vesper 1990). In general, the literature suggests
that entrepreneurs in early middle age (35-45 years old at founding) with several years of
college perform better than others. Industry experience has particular intuitive appeal as a
precursor to entrepreneurial
manufacturing
firm performance.
With the proliferation
of
automation, the demands of computerized control systems and the growing intensity of

263

competition in the manufacturing
sector, substantial industry experience should contribute
positively to firm performance. Several prior studies seem to suggest the importance of
industry experience (Collins and Moore 1970; Hoad and Rosko 1964, Neiswander and
Dollinger 1986). In addition to industry experience, it has been shown that total years of
entrepreneurial experience and number of previous start-ups contribute to future success as an
entrepreneur (Lamont 1972; Ronstadt 1988).
One of the psychological characteristics-McClelland’s
nAch (1961 )---has been used in
prior entrepreneurial studies as a predictor variable (Brockhaus 1982; Homaday and Aboud
1971; Homaday and Bunker 1970). However, it is not yet determined that nAch distinguishes
between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs
(Brockhaus 1982). Despite some conflicting
evidence,
several studies suggest that nAch is positively
related to entrepreneurial
performance (McClelland and Winter 1969; Miner, Smith and Bracker 1989; Sineath and
Hand 1987). In addition, Rotter’s (1966) Locus of Control (LOC) research suggests that those
with an internal orientation (who score “low” on the LOC instrument) attribute success more
to their own efforts than to external influences and luck. While prior research indicates that a
low LOC score on the part of CEOs is correlated with higher firm performance (Govindarajan
1988; Miller and Toulouse 1986; Miller, Kets de Vries and Toulouse 1982), other research
has shown that an internal LOC is related to proactiveness in small firms (Miller, Kets de
Vries and Toulouse 1982). For small firms, those that are often “locked in” to a generic focus
strategy (Porter 1980), proactiveness would seem to be an attribute of some importance in
today’s turbulent environment.
Finally, environmental
scanning behavior has been shown to differ between large and
small firms (Aguilar 1967). In successful small firms, top management is actively involved in
collecting, analyzing and disseminating
environmental
information
for the purpose of
strategy formulation and implementation.
One study demonstrated that high performance
manufacturin.g firms in Texas engage in more and broader environmental
scanning than their
lower perfonning competitors (Daft, Sormunen and Park 1988). Another study of 83 small
independent1.y owned and operated banks (Watts and Ormsby 1990) found that comprehensively attending to identifying changes in the market and industry, sources or conditions of
supply, actions of competitors, and environmental
trends was positively and significantly
related to both organizational effectiveness and efficiency. Khan and Manopitchetwattana
small manufacturing
firms employ significantly
more
(1989) found that innovative,
environmental scanning than the less innovative firms.
This literature suggests that the performance of entrepreneurial firms may be related to
these three drstinct groups of factors: background (age, years of formal education, years of
industry experience, years of entrepreneurial experience and number of previous start-ups),
psychological
characteristics
(nAch and LOC) and environmental
scanning behavior.
Therefore the following hypotheses were formulated to serve as the basis for this study. The
first five hypotheses (Hl through H5) deal with the entrepreneur’s background. Hypotheses
6 and 7 consider the entrepreneur’s psychological characteristics and hypothesis 8 deals with
the entrepreneur’s environmental scanning practices.
Hl:

The entrepreneur’s
number of previous start-ups is positively correlated with firm
performance.
H2: The entrepreneur’s number of years as an entrepreneur (or member of the management
team of an entrepreneurial firm) is positively correlated with firm performance.
H3: The entrepreneur’s
years of formal education are positively correlated with firm
performance.
H4: The entrepreneur’s age at founding is inversely correlated with firm performance.

<-----Page 3----->264

H5: The entrepreneur’s years of industry experience prior to founding is positively correlated
with firm performance.
H6: The entrepreneur’s nAch is positively correlated with firm performance.
H7: The entrepreneur’s LOC is negatively correlated with firm performance when LOC is
measured such that an internal orientation is “low.”
H8: The comprehensiveness
of the entrepreneur’s
environmental
scanning is positively
correlated with firm performance.

Sample
The target population for this study included all manufacturing entrepreneurs (MEs) in the
Tulsa Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and 13 contiguous East Texas counties. MEs were
defined as founders of manufacturing firms in business fewer than 10 years and independently
owned. This rather broad definition of entrepreneurs parallels that used in some previous
research (McDougall and Robinson 1987).
Names, addresses, approximate employment levels and SIC codes were obtained from
various state directories. A mail survey (with follow-up to non-respondents)
was deemed the
only feasible data collection method due to the geographic dispersion of respondents. The Tulsa
MSA is 5,007 square miles while the East Texas counties are 11,002 square miles in area. The
population of firms was 276 in Tulsa and 51 firms in the Texas counties. Usable responses
obtained were 79 in Tulsa and 24 in Texas yielding an overall response rate of 31.5%.

Variables
The dependent variable for firm performance was average annual employment
increase
(EMPGRO).
The reasons for selecting EMPGRO
were (1) small business
owners
(entrepreneurs)
are extremely reluctant to supply accurate accounting
information
to
researchers (Fiorito and La Forge 1986), (2) being privately held the firms in this study do not
publish financial results for public consumption, and (3) previous entrepreneurial
research
suggests average annual employment growth as an appropriate outcome measure (Davidson
1989; Miner, Smith and Bracker 1989). EMPGRO was calculated by dividing total
employment (in 1991) by the number of years the firm had been in business. This calculation
yielded a simplified measure of employment growth rate, which assumes equal growth in
each year of the firm’s existence. Interestingly, small firms starting out did not exhibit higher
EMPGRO rates than firms that began with larger initial employment.
The independent
variables were number of previous start-ups (STARTS), years of
entrepreneurial experience (ENTYRS)-the
number of years of experience as part of the top
management team in an entrepreneurial
firm, years of formal education (EDUC), age of
founding (AGE), years of industry experience (INDEXP), the entrepreneur’s nAch (NACH),
the entrepreneur’s LOC (LOC) and the comprehensiveness
of the entrepreneur’s environmental scanning behavior (SCAN).
All of the background variables (STARTS, ENTYRS, AGE, EDUC and INDEXP) were
self-report measures. NACH was determined with five seven-point Likert scale questions

representing the achievement subscale on the Steers and Braunstein (1976) Manifest Needs
Questionnaire.
This instrument has demonstrated
reasonable levels of convergent and
discriminant validity. Test-retest reliabilities have been 0.75 to 0.86 and Cronbach’s alpha has
ranged from 0.56 to 0.83 (Steers and Braunstein 1976). LOC was measured using Lumpkin’s
(1985) abbreviated six question instrument. This instrument has a reported Cronbach alpha of
0.68 and performs as well in the area of predictive validity as the original LOC Scale
(Lumpkin 1985). SCAN was measured with Miller, Kets de Vries and Toulouse’s (1982) four
question instrument.

Analysis
The first ste:p in the analysis tested Hypotheses 1 through 8 using Pearson product moment
correlation. The second step in the analysis used backward step-wise regression to build a
linear model of entrepreneurial
manufacturing
firm performance. The use of backward
step-wise regression is appropriate in exploratory research (Younger 1979). The rationale for
the regression approach, in Step 2, is that it allows appropriate consideration of a group of
potential predictors as opposed to the consideration of individual predictors as was done in the
first step.
The use of step-wise regression to build a linear model of firm performance is a first step
in an attempt to address the need for such models as expressed by Keats and Bracker (1988).

RESULTS
Respondents were compared to non-respondents
on the basis of SIC code category and firm
size. No significant differences were found. Additionally, the Tulsa sample was compared to
the Texas sample on the basis of variable means and no significant differences were apparent.
It was concluded that non-respondent
bias and differences between the two geographic
regions were not cause for concern. However, it should be noted that firms in this sample do
not perfectI!/ mirror manufacturing
on a national basis with regard to SIC codes. Durable
goods, particularly lumber and wood products, fabricated metal products and non-electrical
machinery, are much more common in this sample (and the underlying population) than they
are on a nabonal basis. We speculate that this reflects the unique nature of the “new firm”
population in Tulsa and East Texas and suggests that one should be cautious in attempting to
generalize th.e results of this study.
It shoul’d also be noted that the average percentage growth rate of the firms in this sample
was well above the national average for 1980-1988 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1991).
Nationally,
employment
in manufacturing
declined 0.6%. With an average initial
employment of 7.4 employees and an average annual employment increase of 4.6 employees,
the firms in this sample were growing at 62%, annually. Reported and computed values for
the dependent and independent variables are shown in Table 1.
The results of the tests of the hypotheses involving computation of the bivariate Pearson
product moment correlations are shown in Table 2. STARTS (r=.200, p<.O5), ENTYRS
(r=.357, pc.OOl), INDEXP (r=.313, p<.Ol) and SCAN (r=.325, pc.001) are significantly
correlated with EMPGRO. AGE, EDUC, NACH and LOC are not significantly correlated
with EMPGRO although all signs (with the exception of AGE) are in the predicted direction.
Hypotheses 1,2,5, and 8 are accepted and hypotheses 3,4,6, and 7 are rejected. It should be
noted that as an individual predictor of performance, STARTS is significant and AGE is not.
However, in the step-wise regression model, AGE is a predictor and STARTS is not. It is

possible that the various background
factors (STARTS, ENTYRS, EDUC, AGE and
INDEXP) are really observable measures of an underlying latent variable+xpertise
(Bull
and Thomas 1993).
The second step in the analysis was an attempt to develop a preliminary model of firm
performance. Using EMPGRO as the dependent variable, a backward, step-wise regression
analysis was run with all eight potential predictors. The full eight variables model reduced to
a simplified model containing four variables after four steps. These were age at founding
(AGE), years of entrepreneurial experience (ENTYRS), industry experience (INDEXP) and
scanning intensity (SCAN). This model explained significant variance in growth (r=.275,
p4Kll).
The resulting regression equation is shown in Table 3. It should be noted that all
signs are in the predicted direction in the regression equation.

Conclusions
Several interesting findings emerged from this study of manufacturing entrepreneurial firms.
First, although a few prior studies (Collins and Moore 1970; Hoad and Roski 1964;
Neiswander
and Drollinger
1986) suggested that INDEXP might be related to firm
performance, other studies have shown mixed results (Cooper and Gascoh 1992). In this
study, INDEXP was correlated at 0.313 (p=.OO2) with one measure of firm performanceaverage annual employment growth (EMPGRO). Since INDEXP is defined as occurring prior

to the founding of the firm, it is seen that some evidence exists that a causal ordering may be
in place. If so, this is a potentially important finding.
Another interesting and potentially important finding was that SCAN was significantly
correlated (r==.325, p-.001) with EMPGRO. Only one previous study was identified that
treated environmental scanning as a predictor of entrepreneurial firm performance (Khan and
Manopitchetwattana
1989) so this is essentially a new finding. Although there has been a
small, but consistent stream of research in the area of environmental
scanning, many of the
studies were descriptive or conceptual and environmental
scanning has only been used
infrequently in empirical studies in recent years.
Disappointingly,
neither LOC nor NACH was significantly correlated with EMPGRO
although both1 signs were in the predicted direction. This lack of support for hypotheses 6 and
the psychological
7 tends to emphasize,
once again, the difficulty of determining
characteristic:< of successful entrepreneurs (Brockhaus 1982; Gartner 1985). It should be
noted (in Table 1) that the standard deviations of NACH and LOC are relatively small. It is
possible that restriction of range causes the two psychological variables to fail a test for
significant correlation. Additional work should be done in this area.
Finally, as shown by Table 3, a “reasonable” multiple regression equation, combining
a number of potential predictors of entrepreneurial
manufacturing
firm performance was
developed in an exploratory fashion utilizing step-wise regression analysis. The overall
r-squared for the regression equation is .275 (p=c.OOl). Utilizing the regression equation, it
is possible to develop a conceptual model of entrepreneurial firm performance as shown in
Figure 1.
There seem to be two categories of factors that contribute to firm performance
(entrepreneur’s background-AGE,
ENTYRS, INDEXP; and entrepreneur’s environmental
scanning practices-SCAN).
This model supports, in modest fashion, the conceptual model
proposed by Keats and Bracker (1988). Taken in the aggregate, the regression equation (Table
3) suggests that younger entrepreneurs
with significant
entrepreneurial
and industry
experience who routinely scan their environments with some intensity would be expected to
perform better than their peers in manufacturing.

firm performance.

The results of the bivariate correlation (i.e., Hypotheses 1 through 8) support, in some
cases, previous research in the field of entrepreneurship.
In particular, the significance of
STARTS, ENTYRS and INDEXP all seem to support the “expertise” requirement of Bull
and Thomas’s (1993) tentative theory of entrepreneurship.
However, individual correlations
between potential predictors and an outcome variable provide limited information with regard
to a multifaceted construct like entrepreneurial
performance. We believe that the primary
utility of this study is in the aggregation of literature-based potential predictors in a linear
model of performance as is shown in Figure 1.
In that this is an exploratory study, it is overly ambitious to propose specific uses for the
research results other than as an initial study in an area that has received only modest attention
recently--entrepreneurial
manufacturing
firm performance. However, if additional research
did tend to confirm the findings of this study, several potential uses are suggested.
Given that there is an increased awareness of the importance of the manufacturing sector
(Dertouzos, Lester and Solow 1989) and a growing awareness of the importance
of
entrepreneurial
manufacturing
firms (Howard 1990), investors and policy-makers
need
improved tools to screen new investments in manufacturing and to develop rational policies
to enhance development in the manufacturing
sector. In the case of the investor, this study
suggests that it might be appropriate to review entrepreneurial experience (ENTRYS), year of
industry experience (INDEXP) and scanning practices (SCAN) while evaluating proposals
for new manufacturing
firms. Although there is some indication that investors do utilize
experience as a screening mechanism (Sandberg 1984; Vesper 1990), it is not clear that
specific types of experience are uniformly used as screening devices. This research suggests
that the specific kind of experience a potential manufacturing entrepreneur has may be linked
to later firm performance. Additionally, scanning practices appear to be linked to performance
and are easily assessed using the Miller, Kets de Vries and Toulous instrument (1982).
From the policy perspective,
federal, state and local programs
to encourage
entrepreneurship are proliferating. Funds are routinely provided for both training and start-up.
Under the Clinton administration it is likely that these programs can expect increased federal
support. However, existing programs frequently focus more on perceived need than on
expectations of successful firm start-up. It appears obvious that the same type of screening
for
criteria that should apply to investors might need to be “built in” to qualifications
government support of entrepreneurship.
Clearly, much additional work needs to be done with this model. It is likely that industry
effects could play an important role in the performance of entrepreneurial
manufacturing

firms. Studies should be conducted within specific industries. Additionally,
despite the
obvious and well-documented
problems of utilizing accounting data as an outcome variable
in small firm research (Fioritto and LaForge 1986), other outcome measures should be used
in future studies. It should be noted that this study focused entirely on attributes of the

a larger population, structural equation testing offers considerable promise in the areas of
uncovering relationships between variables and “uncovering”
