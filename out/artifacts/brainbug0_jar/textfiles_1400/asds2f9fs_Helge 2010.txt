There has not been much discussion of how ﬁrms may assess the value of service innovation projects ex-ante in the extant research literature. This paper theoretically derives a
value assessment tool for service innovation ideas called QSI (tool for pre-Qualiﬁcation of
Service Innovation projects). Thereafter QSI is implemented in three ﬁrms and it is
explored to what degree the implementation improved managerial decision making on
service innovation projects and investments. The ﬁndings indicated that the implementation of QSI had effects both in a portfolio management and a project management
perspective. From a portfolio management point of view deployment of QSI improved the
participating managers’ decision basis for prioritizing and selection of projects. From a
project management point of view implementation of QSI enabled the participating
managers to deﬁne more relevant, realistic and ambitious targets for service innovation
projects than they were able to deﬁne without deploying the tool.
Keywords: Service innovation; innovation management; management control; ex-ante
value assessment.

Introduction
It has been argued that service innovation is a complex and resource-demanding
activity that may have potential long-term beneﬁts for ﬁrms in the service and
manufacturing industries (e.g., Matear, Gray and Garrett, 2004; Miles, 2005; Tidd
and Hull, 2003). Despite this, research speciﬁcally discussing how innovation
creates value and how value assessment of innovation projects may be carried out,
has often focused on other types of innovation, like for example product innovation
(e.g., Cooper, Edgett and Kleinschmidt, 1999; Gofman, Bevolo and Moskowitz,
2009) or sustainability innovation (e.g., Hansen, Grosse-Dunker and Reichwald,
2009), than service innovation. However, ﬁndings from these research streams may
not be directly transferable to service innovation activities, since the effects of
1149

service innovations are arguably more difﬁcult to evaluate than the effects of more
traditional process- and product innovations (e.g., Aas and Pedersen, 2010;
De Jong et al., 2003).
From a management perspective the lack of research on how the value of service
innovation projects may be assessed may be considered concerning. The literature
stresses the importance of controlling resource-demanding and strategically
important activities, like innovation activities, in ﬁrms to avoid ﬁnancial losses,
reputation damage or organizational failure (e.g., Merchant and Van der Stede,
2007). It is particularly worrying that management lacks guidance on how to assess
the value of their service innovation projects ex-ante, since ex-ante value assessment
of innovation projects has been argued to be a fundamental management task both in
a portfolio management perspective (e.g., Cooper, Edgett and Kleinschmidt, 2001),
and in a project management perspective (e.g., Irani and Love, 2002).
By combining insights from different research streams (e.g., Merchant and Van
der Stede, 2007; Simons, 2000; Haka, 2007; Tidd and Bessant, 2009; Conway, 2008;
Droege, Hildebrand and Forcada, 2009; Aas and Pedersen, 2010), this paper suggests
how an ex-ante value assessment tool for service innovation projects may be
designed. Hereinafter we refer to this theoretically derived ex-ante value assessment
tool adapted to service innovation projects as QSI (tool for pre-Qualiﬁcation of
Service innovation projects).
The paper then aims to explore to what degree the implementation of QSI
improves managerial decision making on service innovation projects and investments. The following research questions are raised: What are the effects of
implementing QSI on managers’ ability to: (i) assess the value of service innovation ideas, (ii) manage service innovation projects, (iii) manage the portfolio of
service innovation projects, and (iv) manage innovation activities in general?
The paper is structured in the following way: In the next section, we derive QSI
from theory. Thereafter, we describe the method chosen to answer the research
questions. The ﬁndings are reported in the following section. Then QSI is compared with existing alternatives and the study’s limitations and the needs for
further research are discussed. Finally, some implications and concluding remarks
are provided.

Deriving QSI from Theory
By combining general insights about value assessment from different research
streams we were able to derive requirements that QSI should fulﬁl. The capital
budgeting literature (e.g., Haka, 2007) provide a general list of factors, including
cost, beneﬁt, risk, and time value of money, that should be taken into consideration

when investments are to be valuated. Both the management control literature
(e.g., Merchant and Van der Stede, 2007; Simons, 2000) and the innovation
management literature (e.g., Cooper, Edgett and Kleinschmidt, 2001; Tidd and
Bessant, 2009) warn that using solely ﬁnancial indicators to valuate investments
may cause managers to act myopically. This problem may be especially relevant for
service innovations, since Aas and Pedersen’s (2010) review of the service innovation literature revealed a number of potential direct and indirect non-ﬁnancial
effects of service innovation, including business process, capability, external and
relationship effects. The innovation management literature (Cooper, Edgett and
Kleinschmidt, 2001) also suggests that ex-ante value assessment tools should
preferably consist of a combination of top-down (strategic approaches) and bottomup (scoring models) elements. Furthermore, the foresight literature (Conway, 2008;
Schoemaker, 1995) suggests in general that managers should seek to develop a view
of alternative futures for a ﬁrm before taking strategically important decisions.
To summarize, based on the literature we may propose that QSI should enable
assessment of the value in different prospective commercial situations and should
consist of both bottom-up and top-down valuation methods where ﬁnancial
measures are complemented with measures of non-ﬁnancial effects relevant for
service innovation (see Aas, 2009).
Next, to avoid de novo development of QSI, we evaluated the degree to which
available ex-ante value assessment tools complied with the requirements
suggested. While no tools speciﬁcally designed for service innovation were found
in the extant research literature, we identiﬁed several tools suggested for product
innovation activities. We learned that the product innovation literature (Cooper,
Edgett and Kleinschmidt, 1997, 1999) commonly groups ex-ante value assessment
tools into four large categories; (1) ﬁnancial methods, (2) business strategy
methods, (3) bubble diagrams, (4) scoring models and (5) checklists. None of
these tool categories were found to comply with all requirements suggested for
QSI. However, all the QSI requirements could be met by combining existing
product innovation tools, in particular ﬁnancial methods, business strategy
methods, scoring models and checklists, with foresight tools, and by adapting
these tools to the characteristics of service innovation (e.g., Aas and Pedersen,
2010).
Consequently, we suggest that QSI may consist of three modules: (1) a
business strategy module designed to assess whether the service innovation idea
complies with the business strategy, (2) a scenario assessment module designed to
deﬁne potential scenarios related to the prospective commercial situation for the
new service, and (3) a value assessment module, using a combination of ﬁnancial
methods and scoring models, designed to derive the value of a service innovation
idea for the different scenarios. The modules are illustrated in Fig. 1.

We suggest that a ﬁrm’s business strategy may provide a basis to create
company-speciﬁc checklists that can be used in Module 1. In Module 2, we
suggest that Schoemaker’s (1995) method for scenario construction may be used.
For the most comprehensive module, Module 3, we suggest that the categorization of service innovation effects suggested by Aas and Pedersen (2010) may
serve as a framework. Aas and Pedersen (2010) reviewed the service innovation
literature and suggested that the potential effects of service innovation may be
categorized into ﬁve broad categories: (1) business process effects, (2) capability
effects, (3) relationship effects, (4) ﬁnancial performance effects, and (5) competitiveness effects.
According to Aas and Pedersen’s (2010) ﬁndings, business process effects
embrace changes in the ﬁrm’s business processes, and may be observed, for
example, by changes in service delivery capacity (Lievens and Moenaert, 2000),
productivity (e.g., Hipp, Tether and Miles, 2000; Schulz, 2005) or ﬂexibility
(Hipp, Tether and Miles, 2000; Wong and He, 2005). Capability effects, like for
example learning effects (Blazevic and Lievens, 2004), and employee satisfaction
effects (Van Riel, Lemmink and Ouwersloot, 2004), change the internal capability
of the innovating ﬁrms. Relationship effects refer to the proposition that service
innovation may have effects on the innovator’s relationship with other stakeholders. Examples of relationship effects include effects on the customer’s value
(Sigala, 2006; van Riel and Lievens, 2004), customer satisfaction (Lyons, Chatman
and Joyce, 2007; Matear, Gray and Garrett, 2004) and customer loyalty (Blazevic,
Lievens and Klein, 2003; Ching-Chow, 2007). Competitiveness effects may be
observed as an increased ability to survive (Cowell, 1988). Financial performance
effects may be observed as effects on market share (de Brentani, 1991) or sales
(e.g., Avlonitis, Papastathopoulou and Gounaris, 2001). Aas and Pedersen (2010)
suggested an additional category called external effects. These effects refer to the
effects that service innovation may have on stakeholders other than the innovating
ﬁrm. Examples of external effects are environmental effects (Wong and He, 2005)
and industry structure effects (e.g., Xu, Sharma and Hackney, 2005).
An overview of the service innovation effect categories, and sub-effect categories, suggested by Aas and Pedersen (2010) is indicated in Table 1.
Furthermore, based on their review, Aas and Pedersen (2010) suggested that
business process effects, relationship effects, capability effects and external effects

may be perceived as direct effects of service innovation, and that these direct
effects may lead to the more indirect results of service innovation, that is ﬁnancial
and competitiveness effects.
While these dimensions constitute the potential upside of investments in service
innovation activities, the downsides of investments, that is costs and risks, should

also be taken into account during the assessment of new ideas (e.g., Haka, 2007).
Investment and future operational costs evidently affect the ﬁnancial value
dimension, and should be incorporated therein (e.g., Haka, 2007). Risks may be
related to the external market, addressed in Module 2 of the QSI, and to the
internal development process, addressed in Module 3. While internal risks may
affect both ﬁnancial and competitiveness value, we suggest that they are expressed
as a separate value dimension given the complexity of these relationships. The
value of a service innovation idea may thus be expressed in three dimensions: (1)
ﬁnancial performance; (2) competitiveness; and (3) risk. The service innovation
value dimensions are illustrated in Fig. 2, and are used as a framework for QSI’s
Module 3 (see Aas, 2009).
Based on Aas and Pedersen’s (2010) detailed list of potential effects of service
innovation (see Table 1) it is possible to construct scoreboards for the value
dimensions in Fig. 2. These scoreboards may guide the value assessment in
Module 3. The suggested scoreboards are listed in the appendix of this paper. For
more information about the QSI design, we refer to its web application.a

Method
To ﬁnd the managerial effects of implementing QSI, and answer the research
questions, we applied an interventionist research approach (see Jönsson and
Lukka, 2007), in the form of ﬁeld experiments, where the researcher worked
together with the management in three case organizations. In this research, process
a

<-----Page 6----->Implementing a Value Assessment Tool for Service Innovation Ideas

active participant observation was used as a research method. Thus, the research
design may be characterized as a multiple case study with strong intervention.
The three case organizations were for-proﬁt ﬁrms and were selected because they
had an exceptional focus on service innovation and because their motivation to
participate in the study was very high. It was also an advantage that the three ﬁrms,
prior to the initialisation of the research project, did not use any formal method or
tool to ﬁnd the value of their service innovation ideas. Consequently, our ﬁndings
were not inﬂuenced by the managerial effects of other value assessment tools.
The three ﬁrms were all members of the graphic arts industry. The business areas
of Firm A and B were graphic design, web-design and graphic production for both
digital and printed channels, whereas the business area of Firm C was web-based
media services. An implementation- and test-team consisting of between one and
four managers and a researcher was appointed in each ﬁrm. Some characteristics of
the participating ﬁrms and implementation- and test-teams are presented in Table 2.
QSI was implemented to assess the value of one real service innovation idea in
each ﬁrm. In Firm A QSI was used to assess the value of a project idea called
“TIMLI”. Here the idea was to develop a new service where preparation of
information for different channels would be less complex than how this preparation is done today. In Firm B QSI was used to assess the value of a project idea
called “kindergarten-calendar”. This project idea was to develop a web-based
service where customers, in this case kindergartens, could design their own
calendar and then place a printing order on this calendar to Firm B. In Firm C QSI
was used to assess the value of a project idea called “OnDesign”. Here the idea
was to develop a new web-based service to assist customers in designing documents for printing or digital publication on their own.
All three modules of QSI were used to assess the value of “TIMLI” and “OnDesign”. To assess the value of “kindergarten-calendar”, however, we only deployed
Module 1 and 3 of QSI. This was done because the development of a “kindergartencalendar” service would require a relatively small investment sum, and for this reason

the management of Firm B wanted to use a small amount of resources on the value
assessment. Thus, the implementation of this simpliﬁed QSI version for the
“kindergarten-calendar” idea constitutes a good test of QSI’s scalability.
During the implementation process the usefulness of QSI was continuously
evaluated by the implementation- and test-teams. In addition, the teams were
continuously searching for potential improvements of the tool.

Findings
Experiences
To assess the value of the project ideas called “TIMLI” in Firm A and “OnDesign”
in Firm C all three modules of QSI were deployed. To concretize and exemplify
the experiences with deployment of the full version of QSI we report the value
assessment results for the project idea called “OnDesign” in Firm C here. The
value assessment results for “TIMLI” had a similar character.
The implementation and test teams started the assessment of “OnDesign” by
deriving a checklist to be used in QSI’s Module 1. This checklist consisted of six
questions derived from Firm C’s strategy. Some questions were related to whether
the new service could be based on the technological platform that the ﬁrm had
chosen, and some were related to whether the new service was relevant for the type
of customers the ﬁrm was addressing. By using this checklist it was found that
“OnDesign” complied with Firm C’s strategy.
To derive scenarios for “OnDesign”, in QSI’s Module 2, the two greatest uncertainties related to the prospective commercial situation for the service were identiﬁed.
The ﬁrst uncertainty was related to customers’ future needs and the second was
related to technology. Based on these uncertainties four scenarios for “OnDesign”
were derived. Scenario 1, called “idyll”, was recognized by few competing technological solutions and a high degree of fulﬁlment of customers’ needs. Scenario 2,
called “techno”, was recognised by many competing technological solutions and a
low degree of fulﬁlment of customers’ needs. Scenario 3, called “right track”, was
recognized by few competing technological solutions and a low degree of fulﬁlment
of customers’ needs. Scenario 4, called “blunder”, was recognized by many competing technological solutions and a low degree of fulﬁlment of customers’ needs.
The scenarios derived for “OnDesign” is illustrated in Fig. 3.
In Module 3 of QSI, the value of “OnDesign” in these four scenarios were
assessed. By using the scoreboards (see the Appendix), the implementation- and
test-teams found that business process effects, capability effects, relationship
effects and external effects were relevant in all scenarios. However, to what
degree these effects had potential to inﬂuence on the ﬁnancial performance and

competitiveness varied in the different scenarios. The output from QSI’s Module 3
for “OnDesign” is illustrated in Fig. 4.
To assess the value of the project idea called “kindergarten-calendar”, a simpliﬁed version of QSI, without Module 2, was used. Consequently, this assessment
gave a less complex result. In Module 1 it was found that the idea was in compliance with Firm B’s strategy and by using the scoreboards in Module 3 a three
dimensional value expression was derived. Since scenarios were not developed for
“kindergarten-calendar”, however, the value expression found had a large uncertainty. This was reﬂected by estimating worst-case and best-case values in addition
to the most likely value.
Managerial effects
Prior to the initialisation of the research project, the management of the three
participating ﬁrms expressed that they were struggling to assess the value of their
service innovation ideas. None of them used a formal method or tool to ﬁnd the
value of such ideas, and value assessment was done in a rather occasional manner,
different from idea to idea, and with a focus on short term ﬁnancial beneﬁts.
The participating managers stated that deployment of QSI gave them a much
broader insight in the real value of their ideas. It was argued that QSI enabled them
to identify and valuate a number of potential qualitative service innovation effects,

<-----Page 9----->1158

T. H. Aas

like for example learning effects, culture effects, employee satisfaction effects and
image effects that they were not able to identify and valuate earlier. Before the
implementation of QSI, qualitative effects like this had often been disregarded by
the ﬁrms. The following statement of Firm B’s CEO illustrates this:
“Deployment of QSI has given me a much deeper knowledge of
the value of the kindergarten-calendar idea than I would have
been able to derive without the tool. Without using the tool I
would have been able to give rough estimations of the potential
income and expenditure related to this idea. Deployment of QSI
has not only improved these ﬁnancial estimations, but in addition
raised my consciousness by telling me that accomplishment of the
kindergarten-calendar project may give learning effects that will
have the potential to improve our competitiveness.”
The managers of Firm A and C also appreciated that by combining scenario
construction with value assessment they were given new insight about the
relationship between the prospective commercial situation for the new service and
its value. The following statement of Firm A’s R&D director illustrates this:
“I have often reﬂected on that the value of a particular service
innovation idea, like TIMLI, is very dependent on a number of
factors outside our control. Earlier I have, however, not been able
to describe this in a precise manner. By introducing scenario
analysis in the value assessment process I have been given a tool
to display this vague understanding I had before in a much more
precise and explicit manner.”
We found that the improved insight into the value of service innovation ideas had
effects both in a project management and portfolio management perspective. The
participating ﬁrms had more service innovation ideas than they had resources to
carry out. Therefore, portfolio management, including prioritizing service innovation ideas and selecting what projects to invest in, was an important task for the
management in these ﬁrms. The managers argued that the output from Module 1 of
QSI enabled them to reject ideas that were not in compliance with the business
strategy, or an alternative desired strategy, quicker, and with a higher degree of
certainty, than they were able to do before. The following statement from the R&D
director in Firm A illustrates this:
“Module 1 of QSI gives a very quick and orderly assessment of
the strategic ﬁt of the idea. We did corresponding assessments of
strategic ﬁt also before, but they were done in a more unstructured
and unconscious manner, and they often gave ambiguous results.”

<-----Page 10----->Implementing a Value Assessment Tool for Service Innovation Ideas

1159

It was also argued that the insight about scenarios provided by QSI’s Module 2
contributed in a portfolio management perspective. Although decisions to invest in
a particular project generally are based on a belief that a speciﬁc scenario is likely
to occur, the output from Module 2 enables the management to monitor if the
expected scenario really appears. Consequently, if it, after a while, turns out that a
different scenario is more likely to occur, the management is given an opportunity
to reconsider the investment decision.
The participating managers argued that the detailed project value derived by
deployment of QSI’s Modules 2 and 3 improved the basis for investment
decisions. The following statement of Firm C’s CEO illustrates this:
“We have a relative limited amount of available funds to invest in
innovation projects. Thus, it is important for us to ensure that an
idea is valuable before we decide to invest. In this respect the
output from QSI improves our decision basis considerably, and
enables us to prioritize and select the most valuable ideas.”
From a project management point of view, the participating managers argued that the
improved insight about value provided by QSI’s Module 3 enabled them to deﬁne
more relevant, realistic and ambitious targets for selected service innovation projects
than they were able to deﬁne without deploying the tool. It was also argued that these
improvements laid the foundation for an earlier identiﬁcation of necessary corrective
actions in the subsequent service development stage. These effects on project
management may be illustrated by the following statement from the CEO of Firm B:
“I often have a feeling that we are not able to realize all the
potentials of service innovation projects, but it is very difﬁcult for
me to pinpoint exactly what we are missing. By using the insights
provided by QSI we will be able to derive more precise project
targets before we start, and this will enable us to manage the
projects according to these potentials and realize the potentials.”
The following statement from the CTO of Firm C also illustrates that the output from
QSI is important to be able to manage and control service innovation projects:
“It is not only important to evaluate new service ideas before
development. It is likewise important to evaluate during and after
development, and also after a period in operation. Therefore I
appreciate that the output from QSI prepares us for such evaluations
by telling us what to measure and what the targets should be.”
It was also argued that the scenario assessment accomplished in Module 2 of QSI,
gave an important contribution to project management. Although targets for a

<-----Page 11----->1160

T. H. Aas

particular project generally are based on an expected scenario, the constructed
scenarios give the management an opportunity to monitor if the expected scenario
really appears, and if it does not, the targets should be reconsidered.
In the simpliﬁed version of QSI, implemented in Firm B, Module 2 was
skipped. Consequently, some important managerial effects caused by the scenario
construction were not realized by Firm B. The implementation- and test-teams
argued that accomplishment of Module 2 involved relatively little extra work, and
they therefore suggested that a QSI implementation should include all modules.
In addition to the effects related to portfolio and project management, the CEO
of Firm C stated that implementation of the tool had effects on the ﬁrm’s strategic
management process:
“For us implemenation of QSI has had some important side effects
related to strategic management. Module 1 of the tool has raised
our consciousness about our own strategy, and forced us to deﬁne
a speciﬁc innovation strategy and to think more strategically about
our innovation decisions.”
Furthermore, the implementation and test teams identiﬁed some antecedents
related to the realization of QSI’s managerial effects. For example, the marketing
director of Firm A stated:
“Here in this ﬁrm we have well established routines for how we
handle development projects funded by customers. Unfortunately
our procedures for how we handle internally funded development
projects are not deﬁned that clearly. It is, for example, not clear
who has the authority to make an investment decision. We have to
put such procedures into place, and use QSI as an integrated tool
to realize all its potentials.”
Thus, we suggest that an antecedent for realizing managerial effects is that QSI is
implemented as an integrated part of a larger set of innovation management
procedures. In addition the CEO of Firm B suggested that to ensure equal treatment of different ideas, QSI should preferably be used by a pre-deﬁned “value
assessment team” that was disconnected from the project team.
Suggested improvements of QSI
Although all participating managers agreed that QSI had a positive inﬂuence on
portfolio management, some argued that it was relatively difﬁcult to prioritize
projects based on the rather complex multi-dimensional value expression
provided by the tool. Therefore, based on the experiences, the implementation- and

<-----Page 12----->Implementing a Value Assessment Tool for Service Innovation Ideas

1161

test-teams suggested some improvements. In particular, the suggested improvements were related to how value may be visualized in a more appropriate way for
project prioritizing and selection. It was for example suggested that by plotting the
value of each idea in a three-dimensional co-ordinate system, and by including
symbols for resource need and time frames in the diagram, the decision basis for
project selection would be improved. For more information about these suggested
improvements, we refer to QSI’s web application. We also expect that further
deployment of QSI will result in additional improvements and expansions of the
tool.

Discussion
QSI compared with existing alternatives
The novelty of QSI is twofold: First, the three modules of QSI represent a new
combination of available product innovation value assessment tools. This new
combination facilitates a more comprehensive value assessment than the use of a
single tool provide. Second, QSI is adapted to the speciﬁc characteristics of service
innovation effects. Since service innovation effects are arguably different from the
effects of traditional process and product innovation (e.g., de Jong et al., 2003),
this adaptation was necessary to make the tool relevant for value assessment of
service innovation activities.
Alternative value assessment tools adapted to the speciﬁc characteristics of
service innovation effects, and developed to enable a comprehensive assessment of
the value of service innovation ideas, like QSI, were difﬁcult to ﬁnd in the extant
research literature. Nevertheless, we identiﬁed two tools, SERVQUAL (e.g.,
Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, 1998) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
(e.g., Yang, 2005), that to some degree were related. These tools do not focus on
value assessment of service innovation ideas in the broad sense, but have a narrow
in depth focus on assessment of service quality. Service quality is included in
Module 3 of QSI as one potential relationship effect (effect C7 in Table 1). The
service quality effect is also included in the QSI scoreboard (see the Appendix)
and expected to inﬂuence both ﬁnancial performance and competitive position.
However, since QSI has a broad perspective and is aiming to capture all potential
service innovation effects to enable assessment of value, detailed suggestions on
how each effect may be measured are not included. SERVQUAL and QFD, that
focus exclusively on service quality effects, provide much more details related to
possible measurement and assessment of potential service quality effects. However, SERVQUAL and QFD do not establish a link between service quality and
ﬁrm performance, while QSI does. Nevertheless, deployment of SERVQUAL or

QFD in combination with QSI has the potential to improve the assessment of how
the innovation will inﬂuence on service quality since these tools are more thorough
in that speciﬁc ﬁeld.
Limitations and further research
We believe that by deploying a qualitative interventionist approach, we were able
to identify the true managerial effects of QSI in the studied ﬁrms. It is, however, a
threat to the internal validity that the test period was relatively short, and the
number of ideas assessed was relatively low. We therefore suggest that further
research should evaluate the managerial effects of QSI over a longer period, where
it for example is evaluated whether the value estimated by QSI ex-ante reﬂects the
real value of the project ex-post.
The fact that QSI is tested on relatively few service innovation ideas that all
have a technological aspect, and in relatively few ﬁrms from one industry, may
also be a threat to the external validity. However, since QSI is based on theory
applicable for for-proﬁt ﬁrms in general, we ﬁnd no reason why the ﬁndings
should not be generalizable to all for-proﬁt ﬁrms. Nevertheless, further research
should investigate this in more detail empirically by implementing QSI in ﬁrms
belonging to various industries and by testing the tool on different types of service
innovation projects.
Another limitation with the study is the fact that QSI is the only tool that is
tested. QSI was intentionally implemented in ﬁrms that did not have a formal value
assessment tool implemented before participation in the research study. For this
reason, we were only able to conclude on what managerial effects QSI had,
whereas we were not able to say anything about the managerial effects of other
value assessment tools. Thus, further research should suggest alternative designs
of service innovation value assessment tools and implement them and compare the
managerial effects of these tools with the managerial effects of QSI.

Implications and Concluding Remarks
By deriving, implementing and testing a value assessment tool, called QSI, in three
ﬁrms, the paper contributes to our knowledge on how ex-ante value assessment
may be accomplished for service innovation projects. It was found that the
implementation of QSI had effects both in a project management and a portfolio
management perspective. Thus, the practical experiences reported in the paper
provide considerable assistance and guidance to managers searching for ways to
assess the value of their service innovation ideas.
