<-----Page 2----->Abstract

Dementia and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) are considered as
major health problems in aging population but have rarely been studied
together. The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) is a nationwide
study of Canadian seniors by the University of Ottawa and Health Canada
designed to study the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for dementia.
Analysis has been done only for dementia on data from the first wave (19911996) of this study. In this paper, we present our analysis for both dementia
and cognitive impairment no dementia on a subset of the data, namely those
who were cognitively normal in 1991, and alive in 1996 and also those who
alive in 2001. The adjusted odds ratios for the various risk factors calculated
using logistic regression models and comparisons made between results from
the CSHA-1 ~ CSHA-2 (1991-1996) and CSHA-2 ~ CSHA-3 (1996-2001) are
included.

Introduction

1.1

Motivation and Organization of paper

Dementia and Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (CIND) are considered as
major health problems in aging population but have rarely been studied
together. In collaboration with Dr. Vladimir Hachinski, of the Lawson Health
Research Institute, and Dr. Truls Ostbye, of Duke University, we luckily have
access to the data from the Canadian Study on Health and Aging (CSHA).
Our goals here are to understand the structure of the data at hand, and to
generate hypotheses about some of the possible risk factors for dementia and
CIND in an elderly population and try to examine if stroke poses a risk for
dementia and CIND. Hypotheses generated in this project can be tested and
explored on other data set, such as the data from the Framingham Heart
Study, the clinical data supplied by Dr. David Spence’s project and the data
from Dr. Cechetto’s animal models in order to produce significantly useful
tools for stroke prevention. In terms of the methods, traditional statistical
tools, namely logistic regression and odds ratios calculated from logistic

1

<-----Page 6----->regression models are used in detecting the possible risk factors and their
effects to dementia and CIND.
In terms of the organization of this paper, the first chapter provides a
description of the Canadian Study on Health and Aging and its data sets and
the work we have done on data pre-processing is also included in this chapter.
In addition, we briefly introduce logistic regression model, odds ratios and a
few other relevant statistical concepts that we use in the analysis in this
chapter as well. The statistical analysis of 13 factors on subsets of the data is
included in the second chapter, which includes the models fitted on the data
and results of test of significance and odds ratios. The third chapter provides
the investigation on correlation between stroke and dementia, and also
between stroke and CIND, i.e. whether stroke poses a risk for dementia, using
the same statistical methods as above. Chapter 4 gives the conclusions and
future extensions.

1.2 Introduction to the CSHA

1.2.1

Structure of the CSHA

Nowadays, people are living longer, but unfortunately diseases of aging are
also becoming more common. Among such diseases, many different forms of
dementia pose major threats. Dementia involves a progressive decline in
2

<-----Page 7----->person’s memory followed by other aspects of cognitive functioning due to
brain dysfunction. These patients will eventually become incapable of caring
for themselves and even unable to recognize close family members at the end.
The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA, www.csha.ca) is
conducted as a multidisciplinary, nationwide, multi-center, population-based,
longitudinal study of Canadian seniors which coordinated jointly by the
University of Ottawa and Health Canada. In the CSHA official website shown
above, its objectives were divided into four categories as the following:
1. “Core objectives addressed the prevalence, incidence and risk factors
for dementia, and the impact of dementia on family caregivers”.
2. “Secondary objectives covered other health topics (such as disability,
frailty or healthy aging) that could readily be addressed in the context
of the study”.
3. “In addition, participating investigators were encouraged to add
supplementary “add-on” studies of personal interest to them, and for
which they could obtain separate funding”.
4. “Finally, it was anticipated that the CSHA results would generate
“spin-off” studies that could be undertaken by the same team members
under separate funding arrangements”.
The Canadian Study of Health and Aging has followed a nationally
representative sample of 10,263 elderly Canadians over 10 years and has
3

<-----Page 8----->collected a wide range of information on their changing health status over
that time. Participants were aged 65 and above, and include both community
living and institutionalized elderly from urban and rural areas within Canada.
The CSHA also involves a team of over 60 investigators (clinicians,
epidemiologists, social scientists, psychologists and others) collaborated in 18
study centers across Canada. Data were collected at 5-yearly intervals:
CSHA-1 in 1991, CSHA-2 in 1996, and CSHA-3 in 2001. Limited data were
also collected in 1993.

Figure 1: Flow of Participants over 3 waves of CSHA

In 1991 - 1992, representative samples of men and women aged 65 years
or older were drawn from 36 urban and rural areas over all 10 Canadian
provinces. Within each of the above sampling areas, separate samples were
drawn for community and for institutional people. Of the 10,263 participants,
4

<-----Page 9----->9008 lived in the community while 1255 resided in institutions. However, not
everybody selected in the sample participated all the way through the CSHA.
Residents of the province of Newfoundland (395) were excluded from the
prospective analysis because a legal interpretation of the province’s advance
directive legislation prohibited the use of proxy consent for persons unable to
give full, informed consent to participate in research studies in 1996. In
addition, 2380 participants were considered as being in the situation of either
lost contact, not agree to participate or not selected for further study. In
addition of 1846 death, there were 4680 participants who had to be omitted
after the CSHA-1. In 1996 – 1997, the study continued on all subjects (5642)
who could be contacted and who agreed to participate as the second wave of
the study. The third wave of the study took place on all those who did not
have dementia at CSHA-2 in 2001. 2308 subjects had left the study by that
time.

1.2.2

Study Instruments and data files

Each wave of the study can be described as a diagnostic process, which
contained the cognitive screening test and clinical assessment, combined with
caregiver & risk factor questionnaires and other questionnaires regarding to
additional information such as decedent information or institutionalization

Figure 2: General follow of participants in CSHA

First of all, those in community were invited to the cognitive screening
test for psychometrically testing of cognitive impairment. Participants were
interviewed for 25 – 30 minutes about their health, presence of specific
disorders and limitations in performing basic and instrumental activities of
daily living based on an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. All
participants were tested for dementia by using the Modified Mini-Mental
State (3MS) Examination. People who screened positive (i.e. 3MS < 78), a

6

<-----Page 11----->random sample of those who screened negative (i.e. 3MS ≥ 78) and all
institutional subjects were sent for an extensive clinical evaluation. Within the
clinical evaluation, there were 3 main components. A nurse first re-examed
the 3MS score and collected information on the participant’s medical and
family history. Then every participant needed to take a standardized physical
and neurological exam conducted by a formal physician. After that, all
subjects with a 3MS score of 50 or above continued to neuropsychological
testing. Finally, preliminary diagnoses were made by formal physician based
on the results from the standardized physical and neurological exam, and
followed by case conference where a consensus diagnosis was produced
according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The
clinical exam permitted confirmation of the classification of cognitive
impairment, the diagnosis of dementia, and the differential diagnosis of the
type of dementia. Further more, participants who found to be cognitively
normal based on either the screening test or clinical exam results were asked
to complete the risk factor questionnaire by themselves. Proxies for around a
half of these participants were asked to re-answered the risk factor questions
in order to either ensure the accuracy of provided information about the
subjects or use proxy as a representative for the participant.
In addition to above processes, laboratory tests were undertaken in the
follow-up study. For example, CT scans were brought into the study in
7

<-----Page 12----->CSHA-2, and blood samples were collected in CSHA-3 for genetic and other
analysis. Given the interrelationship between dementia/cognition and
vascular disease, detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and
vascular outcomes were also collected. Finally, abstracted information from
death certificates and provincial health care utilization records were collected
for the study period.
Regarding to the data set holding most of the information we described
above, there are 31 data files in total we have on hand. The following table
describes the correspondence between instruments performed and data files.

As described in previous session, numerous information have been collected
on the participants regarding to their health, history, daily life, hobbies, jobs
etc. all most everything related to or may have effect on their health status
over 10 years were recorded. After going through every data file we have on
hand, in excess of 6000 demographic, psychological, social, clinical and risk
factor variables are available in the data set. It is apparent that all 6000
variable can’t be analyzed at once. They need to be logically grouped into
different categories such that each category will contain factors that may have
similar effect on the prediction of Dementia and CIND. Using such grouping
strategy, we are hoping to eliminate most of the factor variables from the true
potential risk factors within the same group.
Base on nature of the variables we have, there are five categories that we
think is appropriate to distribute variable factors into:
•

Sociodemographic factors:
Participant’s age, sex, institutional/commoditized status, years of
education, rural/urban status, region, race and language are included.

•

General medical factors:
This category includes subject’s medical status and history, such as

9

<-----Page 14----->cholesterol, blood pressure, ApoE4 (i.e. ApoE4 is indicating the
presence of apolipoprotein E4 which is proposed to be a genetic risk
factor for dementia and other diseases), history of diabetes, history of
cerebral disease, history of cerebro-vascular events such as strokes,
history of cardiovascular events, current medication etc.
•

Physical factors:
In this category, we consider variables regarding to subject’s behavior
and ability of daily living. For example, smoking, alcohol consumption,
social support, mood, family etc.

•

Psychological factors:
Psychological factors are the variables regarding short and long term
memory, ability of abstract thinking and executive functioning and so
on. CT scans and 3MS scores are also considered in this category.

•

Environmental factor:
Environmental factors are variables describing the outside factor that
the subject is/was interacting with. Things like jobs, hobbies, living
standard etc are considered.
There may be overlapping of variables across different groups which is

not much of a problem here, because grouping variables is not the way to
eliminate factors. For the purpose of our analysis, we choose to analyze the
socio-demographic factors and other factors which are proposed by other
10

<-----Page 15----->study as possible risk factors such as arthritis, wine consumption, coffee
consumption, regular physical activity and ApoE4.
Since we are at the preliminary stage of the analysis, we want to start
with a sample set that is simple but would lead the investigation to a
meaningful stage. In this case, we choose to start with the 921 participants
who were clearly diagnosed as cognitively normal in CSHA-1 (1991). 300, 152
and 86 of them were cognitively normal, CIND and demented respectively in
CSHA-2 (1996). By the time of the third wave, 107, 85 and 52 of them were
cognitively normal, CIND and demented respectively.

Figure 3: Number of test samples at each status.

The reason to choose subjects that were clearly diagnosed as cognitively
normal instead of subject whose screening result was negative is that we try
to avoid any possible false negative cases. However, there is one limitation
about this strategy, which is the size of the data set will be relatively small.

11

<-----Page 16----->1.4 Methods

1.4.1

Logistic regression model

Logistic regression, which is part of a category of statistical models called
generalized linear models, is chosen since it aims at predicting a discrete class
response variable based on a set of explanatory variables or features.
Moreover, logistic regression allows variables to be continuous, discrete,
dichotomous, or a mix of any of these, which is a particular important
characteristic of the data set.
In logistic regression model, we have a response variable y that
indexes an object’s class. In our case here, we only have 2 classes, y = 1
represents that the subject has dementia or CIND and y = 0 represents that
the subject is cognitively normal. We also have d explanatory variables,

X = ( x1 ,..., xd )T ,
describing each object or case, also in our case here, we have max(d ) = 13 .
In logistic regression, we model the probabilities of belonging to the
various classes given explanatory variable information. A binary-valued
random Y is representing the distribution of the possible values (0 and 1) of y .
Y is Bernoulli random variable, which is jest a special case of a binomial
random variable with one trial. Thus, we will be modeling the conditional
probability
12

<-----Page 17----->p( X ) ≡ p(Y = 1| X ) .
Specifically, a logistic regression model has the form

⎛ p( X ) ⎞
log ⎜
⎟ =η(X ) .
⎝ 1 − p( X ) ⎠
Oftenη ( X ) is a linear predictor. For example, η ( X ) = β 0 + β1 x1 + ... + β d xd .
Now we can rewrite the logistic model as
p ( X ) = p(Y = 1| X ) =

exp[η ( X )]
.
1 + exp[η ( X )]

In more general form, we can write the logistic model as
exp[η ( X )] y
1
p (Y = y | X ) = (
) (
)1− y
1 + exp[η ( X )] 1 + exp[η ( X )]

( y = 0,1)

For each case i in the data set, we know their class Yi = yi and their
explanatory variables X i . As we described above, we are modeling

p( X i ) = p(Yi = yi | X i ) =

exp[η ( X i )]
.
1 + exp[η ( X i )]

The unknown parameters inη ( X ) , e.g., β 0 , β1 ,...β d are estimated via maximum
likelihood with the assumption of Yi are independent. The maximization may
be carried out by least square algorithm which is not included here.

1.4.2

Residual deviance

The residual deviance is a measure of fit of a logistic regression model or a
generalized linear model that is similar to the residual sum of squares in
linear models. The deviance for the fitted model is defined to be
13

<-----Page 18----->∧

∧

D( y; β ) = 2[lmax − l ( y; β )] ,
∧

where l ( y; β ) denote the log likelihood for a fitted model with maximum
∧

likelihood estimates β , and lmax denote the maximum possible log likelihood.
McCullagh and Nelder suggested that the deviance is most useful for
comparing nested models. Suppose model A is nested within model B and let
m denote the change in number of fitted parameters between two models, the
change in deviance
∧

∧

D ( y; β A ) − D ( y; β B )

is a likelihood ratio statistics for testing whether the m extra parameters are
zero. In another word, we can use this to test the significance of the m extra
terms to the model.

1.4.3 Odds ratio from logistic regression model
The odds of the outcome being present among individuals with x present (i.e.
x=1) is defined as

p(Y | x = 1)
.
1 − P(Y | x = 1)
Then the odds ratio is defined as

Odds ratio =

p (Y | x = 1) /1 − P(Y | x = 1) p (Y | x = 1)[1 − P (Y | x = 0)]
=
p(Y | x = 0) /1 − P(Y | x = 0) p (Y | x = 0)[1 − P(Y | x = 1)]

14

<-----Page 19----->The odds ratio is often used to assess the risk of a particular outcome if a
certain factor is present, and it can be derived from a logistic regression model.
If we recall from the previous page that in logistic regression model, the
dependent variable is a logit, which is the log of the odds. Odds ratio can be
derived from this relationship as the following:

⎛ p(Y | x = 1) ⎞
log(Odds ( x)) = log ⎜
⎟ = η ( x)
⎝ 1 − p (Y | x = 1) ⎠
→ log(Odds ( x)) = β 0 + β x
→ Odds ( x) = exp( β 0 + β x )
→ Odds ratio( x) =

exp( β 0 + β x )
exp( β 0 )

→ Odds ratio( x) = exp( β x )
This is correct when the independent variable has been coded as 0 or 1 to
indicate its presence. A confidence interval estimate for the odds ratio is
obtained by calculating the endpoints of a confidence interval for β x and then
exponentiating the two values. In general, the endpoints are given by
∧

∧

∧

exp( β x ± z1−α × se( β x )) .
2

When x is a continuous variable, the odds ratio can be estimated as

Odds ratio( x) = exp(a β x )
where a is the difference between 25% and 75% quantiles of the continuous
variable. And the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio is given by
∧

∧

∧

exp(a β x ± z1−α × a× se( β x )) .

Results of analysis on risk factors for
Dementia and CIND

2.1 Results for Dementia

2.1.1

From CSHA-1 to CSHA-2

We first look at those people who were cognitively normal in CSHA-1(1991)
and alive but also cognitively normal or demented in CSHA-2(1996). As we
described in Chapter 1, we are analyzing 13 factors which are age, sex,
institutional/commoditized status, years of education, rural/urban status,
region, race, language, arthritis, wine consumption, coffee consumption,
regular physical activity and ApoE4. Due to missing values in the dataset, we
have 263 subjects (Dementia: 42, Normal: 221) left with complete information
on 13 factors.
All 13 factors are firstly sent to the stepAIC process to choose the best
logistic regression model according to its Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
value. Test of significance and odds ratios will be calculated for those
variables contained in this model. For this dataset, the chosen variables are

16

<-----Page 21----->age, years of education, coffee consumption and ApoE4. Most of the
socio-demographic factors are eliminated by stepAIC process. In order to
verify the influence of sex, arthritis, wine consumption and regular physical
activity on risk of dementia since they are proposed by other researchers, they
will also be included in further analysis.
Table 2 shows the significance of all 8 variables described above. The
smaller the value is, the more significant the variable is. We can see that age,
years of education, coffee consumption and ApoE4 are highly significant
whereas other variables don’t demonstrate their significance in the model.

Table 3 shows the odds ratios of each of the 8 variables. We can see that
coffee consumption shows statistically significant association with a reduced
risk of dementia whereas ApoE4 shows statistically significant association
with an increase risk of dementia. Moreover, regular physical activity, wine
17

<-----Page 22----->consumption and arthritis present the benefit of reducing risk of dementia
and being female increases the chance of having dementia. However the
effects from these four factors are not found to be statistically significant here.
Age and years of education continue to show statistical significant influence
on risk of dementia here as they do in Table 2.

<-----Page 23----->Some of the hypotheses generated from above analysis are matching with
the results from other studies. In the prospective analysis of CSHA data done
by Joan Lindsay, increasing age, low educational level and ApoE4 are also
found to be significantly associated with increased risks of Alzheimer’s
disease (one particular type of dementia) and coffee consumption was
significantly associated with reduced risk. Moreover, they identified that the
benefit of regular physical activity and wine consumption were statistically
significant which our analysis did not find. One major difference between two
analyses is the starting point. We start with people who were clearly
diagnosed as cognitively normal in CSHA-1 whereas they also include people
who were screened negative but didn’t have the clinical assessment. Within
those who were screened negative and did get the clinical assessment, we find
that around 1/5 of them are actually demented or CIND. In this case,
including those who were only screened negative would give a larger data set
but also would have the risk of false negative.

2.1.2

From CSHA-1 to CSHA-3

After the analysis on the period from CSHA-1 to CSHA-2, we look at those
people who were cognitively normal in CSHA-1(1991) and alive as well as
cognitively normal or demented in CSHA-3(2001). The same 13 factors were

19

<-----Page 24----->considered as well. Due to the missing values in the dataset, we have 123
subjects (Dementia: 36, Normal: 87) left with information of all 13 factors
present.
Same as before, the stepAIC process is used to choose the best logistic
regression model. Only age and years of education are chosen at this time.
Most of the factors are eliminated. In order to verify the influence of sex,
arthritis, coffee consumption, ApoE4, wine consumption and regular physical
activity on risk of dementia and make comparison with their effect from
CSHA-2, they will also be included in further analysis.
Table 5 shows the significance of all 8 variables described above. We can
see that age and years of education are still highly significant whereas coffee
consumption and ApoE4 have lost its significance and other variables remain
insignificance to the data.

statistically significant association with risk of dementia. ApoE4 shows an
association with an increase risk of dementia but the effect is not found to be
significant. Moreover, regular physical activity, coffee consumption, wine
consumption and arthritis have the same effect as before on the risk of
dementia and being female increases the chance of having dementia.
However the effects from these five factors are not shown statistically
significant here, even though coffee consumption was significantly associated
with a decrease risk of dementia previously. Age and years of education
continue to show statistically significant and strong influence on risk of
dementia.

§ Adjusted for age, sex, and education

In Table 7, we can observe that both groups of years of education show
that lower education increases the chance of being demented and both groups
21

<-----Page 26----->of age show the trend that higher age group has a high probability of being
demented as before. However, the group of age more than 85 is not
significant anymore. The reason is that there are only 4 elderly subjects made
to CSHA-3 with age more than 95 in 2001, so that the percentage of people
being in the ≥ 85 age group is very small. In fact, among 4 of these subjects, 2
of them are demented and 2 of them are cognitively normal. Therefore, the
ability of identifying the influence of such age group on dementia is limited.

Among 13 selected variables, only age and years of education have

both of the two phases of the study. Coffee consumption and ApoE4 showed
their significant relationship with the risk of dementia for the period of
CSHA-2, but lost their significance by the time of CSHA-3. The rest of the
variable show different impact on risk of dementia, but the relationship is not
found to be statistically significant.

2.2.1

From CSHA-1 to CSHA-2

For the analysis of CIND, we look at those people who were cognitively
normal in CSHA-1(1991) and alive and also CIND in CSHA-2(1996). In this
case, we model the probability of having CIND instead of being demented
now. The same analysis strategy and tools are used here as well. The same set
of 13 factors is selected and to be analyzed. Due to the missing values in the
dataset, we have 306 subjects (CIND: 85, Normal: 221) left with information of
all 13 factors present.
The stepAIC process is used again. For this dataset, the chosen variables
are age, years of education and sex. Most of the socio-demographic factors are
eliminated. In order to verify the influence of arthritis, wine consumption,
coffee consumption, ApoE4 and regular physical activity on risk of CIND and
to compare with the results for dementia, they will also be included in further
analysis.
Table 8 shows the significance of all 8 variables. We observe that age,
years of education are the only two factors which are highly significant
whereas other variables don’t demonstrate their significance to the data.

here. Age and years of education continue to show statistical significant

survived through the third wave of the study, namely who were cognitively
normal in CSHA-1(1991) and alive and also cognitively normal or CIND in
CSHA-3(2001). The same 13 factors were considered as well. Due to the

included in further analysis.
Table 11 shows the significance of all 8 variables. We can say that age is

<-----Page 32----->In conclusion, younger age and more years of education seem to be
protective to CIND always. Regular physical activity, coffee consumption,
wine consumption and arthritis keep having the same effect on the risk of
CIND regardless of the time. However, the risk of CIND shifts from female to
male at the end of the second study. The ApoE4 shows negative impact on
protecting CIND. However the findings on ApoE4, sex, regular physical
activity, coffee consumption, wine consumption and arthritis do not pass the
statistical significance test.
To compare the risk factors’ influence on dementia and CIND, we find
that age and years of education are common risk factors for both, and have
the same effects to the risk of both disease. Coffee consumption has a
significant association with reduced risk of dementia in the early phase of the
study, but it doesn’t appear to be significantly beneficial for CIND. Similarly,
ApoE4 is significantly associated with an increase risk of dementia but it is
not the case for CIND. The rest of the risk factors are all associated with
dementia and CIND in the same way, and none of these relationships appear
to be statistically significant.

In this analysis, since we are focusing on relationship between stroke and
dementia or CIND, we only model the probability of dementia or CIND using
age, sex, years of education and history of stroke as predictors in the logistic
regression model.
We first look at those people who were cognitively normal in
CSHA-1(1991) and alive and also cognitively normal or demented in
CSHA-2(1996). Without any cases with incomplete information, we have 364
subjects left to work with.

described above. Age and years of education are highly significant whereas
sex and history of stroke do not demonstrate their significance to in the
model.

§ Adjusted for age, sex, and education

Combining the results from two phases of the study, stroke does show
an association with an increase risk of dementia and CIND, and the
association is getting stronger over time which can be seen through the odds
33

<-----Page 38----->ratios. However, the confident intervals of the odds ratios do not confirm the
association is significant. At the same time, we confirm the strong association
of age and years of education with the risk of dementia and CIND once again.

34

<-----Page 39----->Chapter 4
Conclusion & Extension

In conclusion, through our analysis, we find that age and years of education
have a strong significant effect on the risk of dementia and CIND. Younger
age and more years of education seem to be protective for Dementia and
CIND. Coffee consumption may reduce the risk of dementia whereas the
presence of ApoE4 genes may increase the risk of dementia at CSHA-2. The
influence of other factors on the risk of dementia and CIND as described in
previous 2 chapters isn’t found to be significant. History of stroke does show
an association with an increase risk of dementia and CIND, but not
statistically significant enough to be considered. All finding in our analysis
may be considered as hypothesis and to be further investigated through other
methods or on other dataset. Because of our way of choosing subsets of data
in order to avoid any false negative cases, our sample sets have relative small
size. Therefore, the distribution of values for some variables may be largely

35

<-----Page 40----->uneven. In this case, some of the relationships between factors and disease
may only indicate themselves but could not form any statistical significance.
Regarding to the extension of this project, there are a lot more things can
be done with the data from CSHA. On one hand, a lot of other factors within
the dataset have not been analyzed yet, and any hypothesis generated from
this dataset can be evaluated on other studies. On the other hand, due to the
rich texture of the data from CSHA, such as image data, genetic data,
numerical data, text etc., new algorithm can be developed particular for this
kind of dataset and the dataset would also be good for testing any existing
analytical methods as well. A long term goal for the mathematical research
would be to show that the data mining methods of important interest to
dementia prevention research could be proved to be statistically valid when
generating a hypothesis from a single data set. Our analysis here is only
trying to fulfill the immediate term goals which are to understand the
structure of the data at hand, and to generate hypotheses about dementia and
CIND prevention based on that understanding. This analysis should be just a
beginning of a series of analysis. Further research is definitely needed.
