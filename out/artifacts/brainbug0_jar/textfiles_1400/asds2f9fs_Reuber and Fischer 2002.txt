Foreign Sales and Small
Firm Growth: The
Moderating Role of the
Management Team
A. Rebecca Reuber
Eileen Fischer

The premise of this article is that the management team of a small firm plays a key role in
internationalization outcomes. Specifically, it is hypothesized that a greater degree of behavioral integration within a small firm’s management team enables it to manage the complexity of foreign sales growth more effectively, leading to greater overall firm growth. Findings,
based on data collected from two different industries (software products, food processing),
support the hypothesis and indicate that the behavioral integration of the management team
moderates the relationship between foreign sales growth and overall firm growth.

Introduction
What enables small firms to manage foreign sales effectively? Although business
owners enter foreign markets to serve growth objectives (Jones, 1999; McDougall, Shane,
& Oviatt, 1994), often encouraged by their advisors and governments, it is not necessarily the case that selling in foreign markets contributes positively to overall firm growth.
Managing growth itself is difficult for small firms (Hambrick & Crozier, 1985), and managing growth through foreign sales can be even more difficult due to the “liability of
foreignness” (cf. Zaheer, 1995). There are likely to be cultural and linguistic differences
to become accustomed to, increased regulatory constraints and paperwork to deal with,
and higher product-market costs to fund.
The establishment of a direct relationship between small firm internationalization and
small firm performance has been notably absent from previous research. This is partially
because much of the research on small firms tends to focus on firms’ internationalization
itself as the dependent variable of interest (Leonidou, 1998), rather than attending to the
impact of internationalization on firm performance. Moreover, those studies which do
focus specifically on this relationship conclude that we cannot assume a direct relationship between foreign sales and firm growth. For example, Bloodgood, Sapienza, and
Almeida (1996) found that the extent of internationalization at the time of IPO was only
marginally related to income, and not at all related to sales growth. McDougall and Oviatt
(1996) found that foreign sales as a proportion of total sales was significantly related
to relative market share, but not to overall firm profitability. In a large-scale study of
small- and medium-sized enterprises, Westhead, Wright, and Ucbasaran (2001) found that
exporting was not significantly related to sales growth, employment growth, or even firm

The article addresses this gap in our understanding of small firm internationalization.
Specifically, the article examines the role of the firm’s management team in moderating
the relationship between foreign sales growth and firm growth. Following Sanders and
Carpenter (1998), growing foreign sales is seen as increasing the complexity of, and therefore the information processing demands on, small firms. We hypothesize that management teams with a higher degree of behavioral integration will be better able to manage
these demands, and hence, that the behavioral integration of the management team will
positively moderate the relationship between foreign sales growth and firm growth.
After the development of the hypothesis in the following section, our research design
is described and the empirical results are presented. The results are based on a sample of
small firms from two different industries, the Canadian software products industry and
the Canadian food processing industry. The article concludes with a discussion of the
implications and limitations of the research and suggested avenues for further research.

Theory and Hypothesis Development
Previous research on the internationalization of small firms indicates that the outcomes of a foreign market entry are affected by a range of factors related to the entry
decision, such as entry mode, entry timing, product/service adaptation, and network partners (e.g., Autio, Sapienza, & Almeida, 2000; Cavusgil & Zou, 1994; Lu & Beamish,
2001; Zahra, Ireland, & Hitt, 2000), as well as contextual factors, such as the environment and firm-specific resources and capabilities (McDougall, Shane, & Oviatt, 1994;
Reuber & Fischer, 1999; Shrader, Oviatt, & McDougall, 2000). A small firm that is
growing foreign sales therefore operates in a decision context with a multitude of decision parameters. Moreover, because the process of growing foreign sales in small firms
is often opportunistic (cf. Coviello & Munro, 1997; Crick & Jones, 2000), management
frequently needs to respond quickly to a narrow window of opportunity, and so a firm’s
ability to consider all of these decision parameters simultaneously will frequently be
constrained.
A greater quantity and heterogeneity of decision factors to consider results in greater
environmental complexity, and, in turn, in greater uncertainty and greater information
processing demands to be managed (Dess & Beard, 1984; Duncan, 1972; Pfeffer &
Salancik, 1978). Hence, growing sales in foreign markets is expected to increase the
information processing demands placed on small firms (Sanders & Carpenter, 1998).
We argue that the “behavioral integration” (Hambrick, 1994) of a firm’s management
team is expected to be consequential to how small firms deal with these information
processing demands.
Hambrick (1994) defines behavioral integration as “the degree to which the group
engages in mutual and collective interaction” (1994, p. 188), which involves interaction
and joint decision making. It is expected that teams with greater behavioral integration
will manage foreign sales growth in a more coordinated fashion, leading to greater overall
firm growth. Conversely, teams with lower behavioral integration will manage foreign
sales growth in a more fragmented fashion, leading to lower overall firm growth. There
are four reasons for this conclusion, as outlined below.
First, research on the internationalization processes of small firms indicates that
foreign sales growth in small firms results from a combination of planned direction, strategy formulation and implementation, and creeping incrementalism, numerous day-to-day
30

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->inquiries, meetings, and actions (Kutschker & Bäurle, 1997). Thus, one-time, short-term
decisions can be sticky and can impact longer-term plans; for example, increased exports
could make up for a decline in domestic sales without addressing the reason for the
decline. Along these lines, Bonaccorsi (1992) has argued that some small firms might
favor increased exporting because it is the path of least resistance to growth, rather than
the best path, compared with horizontal growth or product diversification. In order for
international activities to be beneficial to the firm as a whole, therefore, it is necessary
to share information and coordinate activities, on both a day-to-day and a longer-term
basis. Indeed, research on multinational corporations indicates that the degree of internationalization of the firm is related to the need for management team members to elicit
advice from each other (Athanassiou & Nigh, 1999, 2000) and to coordinate activities
(Boter & Holmquist, 1996; Roth, Schweiger, & Morrison, 1991).
The second reason that the behavioral integration of the management team is
expected to impact the relationship between foreign sales growth and overall firm growth
is that previous studies of the internationalization processes of both small and large firms
emphasize the importance to internationalization outcomes of experientially acquired
tacit knowledge, at both the individual and firm level (Athanassiou & Nigh, 1999, 2000;
Eriksson et al., 1997; Johanson & Vahlne, 1977, 1990). This occurs through a variety of
mechanisms, such as changes in attitude (for example, a stronger commitment to foreign
markets), changes in perceptions (for example, assessments of obstacles and risks), and
changes in competencies (for example, knowledge of foreign business practices or new
technologies (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977, 1990; Shrader, Oviatt, & McDougall, 2000;
Zahra, Ireland, & Hitt, 2000). At the individual level of analysis, tacit knowledge is
transmitted through direct participation in relevant decisions and actions (Lave & Wenger,
1991; Sternberg & Caruso, 1985), and so it is expected that teams with greater behavioral integration will have a greater capacity for utilizing the tacit knowledge that individual team members have acquired. At the firm level, tacit knowledge is transmitted
through the organizational processes developed through evolutionary paths. Again, more
integrated teams will have a greater capacity to utilize the organization’s tacit knowledge
effectively (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).
The third reason that the behavioral integration of the management team is expected
to be consequential to the transformation of foreign sales growth into overall firm growth
has to do with the importance of timing. This is partially an issue of speed: greater behavioral integration allows management teams to react more quickly (Hambrick, 1994),
which is important in decisions about foreign markets when the window of opportunity
is narrow or when there are first mover advantages (cf. Mascarenhas, 1997; Pan, Li, &
Tse, 1999). Speed may even be particularly beneficial to small firms compared with large
firms: because of their greater agility and flexibility (cf. Acs, Morck, & Yeung, 1999;
Chen & Hambrick, 1995), they can benefit from early foreign market entry even in the
absence of a large foreign market resource commitment (Mascarenhas, 1997). Timing,
however, is also an issue of temporal management. Research on small firms indicates that
the active management of shared time frames is associated with growth (Gersick, 1994;
Slevin & Covin, 1998). It is important that these time frames be shared among managers
to allow decision options to be considered simultaneously as much as possible, and to
ensure that members of the management team both select and shape time frames with a
congruent vision of the desired future and the rate at which it will be achieved (cf. Fischer
et al., 1997). Shared time frames are apt to be more present in management teams with
greater behavioral integration, in turn suggesting that greater behavioral integration is
likely to be associated with a better ability to manage foreign sales growth in a way that
contributes effectively to overall firm growth.

<-----Page 3----->Finally, behavioral integration is also likely to mitigate any negative effects of belief
diversity within the management team. Miller, Burke, and Glick (1998) point out that
while a diversity of beliefs among top management team members can lead to more
extensive consideration of issues facing the firm, and can reduce “groupthink” (Janis,
1972), the negative consequences can outweigh the positive consequences, because
diversity is often accompanied by communication, integration, and political problems.
A team with high behavioral integration is less likely to experience these difficulties.
Indeed, social interaction is likely to influence beliefs among top management team
members (Chattopadhyay et al., 1999) and the social integration of the top management
team has been found to be related to firm growth in technology-based firms (Smith et al.,
1994). Therefore, a management team with greater behavioral integration is expected
to be able to take differing opinions into account and yet move forward in a coordinated
manner to a greater extent than a management team with a lower level of behavioral
integration.
Thus, for the reasons outlined above, it is expected that more behaviorally integrated
teams will enable small firms to grow foreign sales in a manner that leads to overall firm
growth, leading to the hypothesis to be tested in this article:
H1: The behavioral integration of the management team positively moderates the
relationship between foreign sales growth and overall sales growth for small
firms. Foreign sales growth will have a stronger positive impact on overall sales
growth when a management team exhibits a higher degree of behavioral integration than when a management team exhibits a lower degree of behavioral
integration.

Research Method
Sample and Survey Administration
Industry Selection. In order to explore the generalizability of the results, we tested the
hypothesis with data collected from two different industries. A classification that has been
widely used to describe internationalization patterns, and that is related to the nature of
the underlying environmental complexity, is the distinction between global industries and
multidomestic industries (Kobrin, 1991; Porter, 1986). In global industries, competition
is on a worldwide basis; in multidomestic industries, competition is on a country-bycountry basis. Global industries can be contrasted with multidomestic industries by their
higher technological intensity and their lower market barriers, such as less pressure to
conform to local preferences, practices, and regulations (Kobrin, 1991; Porter, 1986;
Rosenzwieg & Singh, 1991). In global industries, the environmental complexity of internationalization for small firms stems from the need to sell in multiple markets because
of high R&D costs, while managing continued innovation. In multidomestic industries,
the environmental complexity of internationalization for small firms stems from high
market barriers and a greater liability of foreignness (cf. Zaheer, 1995). Given the
complexity of both types of industries, and the corresponding information processing
demands on the management teams, it is expected that the hypothesis will hold for them
both.
We drew samples from the Canadian software products industry (global industry)
and the Canadian food processing industry (multidomestic industry). Using the index
developed by Kobrin on the basis of intrafirm trade (1991), software products are among
32

<-----Page 4----->the most globally integrated industries, while food processing industries are among the
least globally integrated. This is consistent with Canadian exports in these sectors. In
1995, the export intensity of the software products and food processing industries were
52 percent and 19 percent, respectively, and although more than 70 percent of Canadian
software product firms exported, fewer than 50 percent of food processing firms
did (Baldwin, Sabourin, & West, 1999; Kormylo, 1998).1
Sampling Procedures and Data Collection. Firms were selected in order to obtain a
sample that varied in size and age, but that were considered small and independent. Firm
size has traditionally been a primary sampling criterion in research on the internationalization of emerging firms (Leonidou & Katsikeas, 1996). With recent scholarly interest
in international new ventures (McDougall, Shane, & Oviatt, 1994; Oviatt & McDougall,
1994), firm age is being used more often (for example, McDougall & Oviatt, 1996;
Shrader, Oviatt, & McDougall, 2000; Zahra, Ireland, & Hitt, 2000). Firm size was the
primary sampling criterion used here because the theoretical focus is small firms. In addition, it is expected that firms in multidomestic industries internationalize at an older age
than do firms in global industries, and so sampling on firm age would systematically
exclude from the study food processing firms that effectively internationalize, but at an
older age. The focus on small firms is consistent with the population of the two industries because the majority of the firms are small.
Firms that had 200 or fewer employees, that were not subsidiaries of other firms, and
that were headquartered in Canada were eligible for inclusion. In the software products
industry, only firms deriving 50 percent or more of their revenue from software products
(versus hardware or computing services) were eligible. In the food processing industry,
all agricultural producers and all pure distributors were excluded, ensuring that the firms
derived some portion of their revenue from processing raw materials. The majority of the
firms in both samples were located in the Toronto region, which has the largest concentration of both households and businesses in the country, in order to reduce any systematic variation due to the size of local markets or differing economic conditions.
Several sources were used to identify firms in both industries. The primary sources
for identifying software product firms were the Branham 400 database (version 2.4) of
software firms, developed for Industry Canada and the Canadian government’s BOSS
Directory of Computer Software and Services. The primary sources for identifying food
and beverage firms were the Ontario Agri-Food Source Guide and the Canadian government’s Canadian Food and Beverage Exporters Directory. Although it is unlikely that
these directories contain the entire population of firms in the two industries, since entries
and exits are ongoing, they are the most comprehensive directories available, compiled
from many diverse sources throughout Canada. They are also updated on a continual
basis, and so they contain firms that are very small and very new, as well as established
firms.
Of the 612 firms that were contacted and that conformed to the screening criteria,
217 agreed to participate and provided usable data, for a response rate of 35 percent. The
most common reason given for not participating was being too busy to schedule a personal interview. There were no other discernible patterns between the firms that agreed
to participate and those that declined. Since the management team was a primary explanatory construct in the theoretical perspective developed, we excluded very small firms

isolating “management team” characteristics and processes in such firms might be meaningless. This excluded an additional 30 firms, leaving a final sample of 187 firms: 90 in
the software products industry and 97 in the food processing industry.
The questionnaire was administered by trained research assistants to the firms’ CEO
or (if the CEO was not available) to a member of the firms’ top management team, in his
or her office. The research assistants were trained to clarify the nature of the questions
and to explain their rationale, in order to enhance the completeness and accuracy of the
data collected. They also noted any difficulties in answering the questions, and these were
followed up and clarified through subsequent communication with the respondent. Data
were collected between June of 1996 and August of 1999.
Sample Representativeness. The representativeness of the sample is difficult to assess
because, due to the heterogeneity of the industries (Baldwin, Sabourin, & West, 1999;
Kormylo, 1998), it is hard to specify exactly what a representative sample would be. In
1995, 91 percent of the roughly 5,300 software product firms in Canada had fewer than
10 employees and revenues less than $250,000 (Kormylo, 1998). The sample firms are
larger than those of the population (sample mean number of employees = 37 vs. population mean number of employees = 5), and have a higher growth rate (sample two-year
growth rate of total sales of 65 percent vs. population two-year growth rate of total sales
of roughly 57 percent). It should be noted, however, that population figures are based on
1995 data and the industry has been experiencing growth since 1995, and so it is expected
that population statistics for firm size and growth would have been closer to sample statistics at the time of data collection. The export intensity of the software products sample
is lower than that of the population, but is of the same magnitude (46 percent for the
sample, 52 percent for the population). Thus, although the difficulties of determining
representativeness need to be kept in mind, the software product firms in the sample
appear to be reasonably comparable to the population with respect to firm growth and
the importance of international sales in contributing to firm growth.
The Canadian food processing industry, consisting of roughly 3,000 firms in Canada
in 1995, is also heterogeneous due to considerable variation among subsectors. Looking
at sample and population means, the sample firms are somewhat smaller than those of
the population (sample mean number of employees = 51 vs. population mean number
of employees = 64), but have a much higher growth rate (sample two-year growth rate
of total sales of 30 percent vs. population two-year growth rate of total sales of 12
percent). These population figures are also based on 1995 data: this industry has been
relatively stagnant and so the population mean firm size might have decreased at the time
of data collection to be closer to the sample mean, but it is unlikely that the population
mean for sales growth would have increased. The export intensity of the sample is greater
than that of the population, but is of the same magnitude (22 percent for the sample, 19
percent for the population). Thus, although the difficulties of determining representativeness need to be kept in mind again, the food processing firms in the sample appear
to be somewhat more growth oriented than the population.

Dependent Variable: Total Sales Growth. Percentage change in sales is a key indicator
of performance for small and new firms (Brush & Vanderwerf, 1992). Self-reported return
measures, such as return on income (ROI) and return on assets (ROA), can have low
reliability for a small business (Chandler & Hanks, 1993), and, because of the tax incentives to keep income low, income-based performance measures are not considered
accurate for new and small Canadian firms. Income-based measures related to the
foreign sales of small firms are particularly noisy given variation in the way firms account
for foreign currency ex-change and monetary trade barriers such as customs duties and
tariffs.
To measure total sales growth, respondents were asked by what percentage their total
annual sales had changed over the past two fiscal years. A two-year time period was
chosen as a period long enough to smooth periodic fluctuations in sales, revealing a
longer-term trend, but short enough to avoid major changes in product-market characteristics. Because the variable is positively skewed, a logarithmic transformation was used
in subsequent analyses.

35

<-----Page 7----->Independent Variable: Foreign Sales Growth. Growth in foreign sales was measured
as the percentage change in total foreign sales over the past two years, which is the same
time period used for measuring the dependent variable, growth in total sales. Respondents were asked by what percentage their total annual foreign sales had changed over
the past two years. Because the variable is positively skewed, a logarithmic transformation was used in subsequent analyses.
As expected, the independent and dependent variables are significantly correlated,
because foreign sales growth is a component of overall sales growth. However, also as
expected, a relatively small percentage of the variance in total sales growth is associated
with the variance in foreign sales growth (r2 = .12 for the software product firms; r2 = .15
for the food processing firms). This supports the notion that it is important to understand
the factors that increase or suppress the tendency for foreign sales growth to contribute
to total sales growth.
Moderating variable: Behavioral Integration. Behavioral integration is measured as a
variable reflecting two interrelated indicators of behavioral integration: interaction and
joint decision making among management team members. Interaction was measured by
asking respondents how often, per year, the management team meets together as a whole.
Joint decision making was measured by asking respondents how many top management team members had an influence on three types of decisions: entering or exiting a
new geographic market, adding or dropping a major product, and adding or dropping a
distribution channel. Each response was then divided by the number of people on the top
management team so that it was not biased by team size, and the three values were
summed together to form the variable measuring joint decision making. The measure
exhibits high reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of .93 for each sample.
These two indicators of behavioral integration are significantly correlated (r = .194,
p = .04 for the software product firms; r = .297, p = .002 for the food processing firms),
and so it is not only logical but also justifiable to combine them into one measure. So
that each element constitutes the same proportion of the composite variable, the measure
of behavioral integration is calculated as the sum of the two z-scores.
Control Variable: Firm Age. Firm age is measured as the age of the firm in years. It is
expected that older, more established firms will outperform new firms, due to the liabilities associated with newness (Stinchcombe, 1965). On the other hand, once firms survive
the liabilities of newness, there are expected to be inertial forces associated with age,
which inhibit firms’ ability to grow (Baum, 1989), and so from this point firm age is
expected to be negatively related to total sales growth. Since sampling was based on firm
size, the sample exhibits a wide range of age, with 79 percent of the firms being over six
years old. Liabilities of age are therefore expected to dominate liabilities of newness, and,
as shown in Table 1, firm age is significantly and negatively related to total sales growth.
However, because of the expected curvilinear relationship, both firm age and the square
of firm age were included in the regression equations.2
2. Firm size was also considered for inclusion as a control variable. However, in both samples, it was not
significantly correlated with the dependent variable and was significantly correlated with two independent
variables, resulting in multicollinearity. Accordingly, a better model resulted from its exclusion. Its inclusion
or exclusion makes no material difference to the results of the analyses: for both samples, all F values and
regression coefficients remain at the same level of significance, and there is less than .01 impact on the
adjusted R2 of Equation 4.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->Analysis and Empirical Results
The hypothesis specifies that the form of the relationship between foreign sales
growth and overall firm sales growth is moderated by the behavioral integration of the
firm’s management team, in that firm growth is posited to be a joint function of foreign
sales growth and behavioral integration (cf. Arnold, 1982; Sharma, Durand, & Gur-Arie,
1981). The hypothesis is tested with four hierarchical regression equations for each industry, as shown in Table 2.3
The first equation regresses the dependent variable, total sales growth, on the control
variable, firm age; the second adds the independent variable, foreign sales growth; the
third adds the moderator variable, behavioral integration; and the fourth adds the interaction term (foreign sales growth ¥ behavioral integration).
For both samples, the coefficient of the moderator variable is not significant in
Equation 3, while the coefficient of the interaction term is significant in Equation 4, indicating that the variable is a pure moderator (cf. Sharma, Durand, & Gur-Arie, 1981;
Zedeck, 1971). For both samples, the addition of the interaction term in Equation 4
significantly increases the R2 over that of the additive model in Equation 3, and there is
a positive coefficient on the interaction term, indicating that larger values of behavioral
integration increase the slope of the relationship between foreign sales growth and total
sales growth. These findings support the hypothesis.
An examination of the partial derivative of Equation 4 over foreign sales growth with
respect to the z-transformed behavioral integration variable explores the findings further.
The inflection point is within the range of observed values of the standardized behavioral
integration variable, which means there is a nonmonotonic effect: the contribution of
foreign sales growth to overall firm growth increases for most of the range of behavioral
integration (behavioral integration >0.48 for the software product firms; behavioral
integration >0.20 for the food processing firms), but has a negative effect on overall
firm growth for lower values of behavioral integration (cf. Schoonhoven, 1981). Thus,
the greater the degree of behavioral integration among management team members, the
greater the positive impact of foreign sales growth on firm growth, as hypothesized.
However, these findings also indicate that a minimal level of behavioral integration
is required: below this level, foreign sales growth has a negative impact on firm
growth.
This effect is depicted graphically in Figure 1, which shows, for each industry,
the change in the log of total sales growth, given a change in the log of foreign
sales growth, over the observed values of the standardized behavioral integration
variable. Furthermore, the graphs in Figure 1 also indicate that the line for the food
processing firms is steeper than that for the software product firms: for food processing
firms, a unit increase in behavioral integration results in a greater positive impact
of foreign sales growth on total sales growth, while, conversely, a unit decrease in behavioral integration results in a greater negative impact of foreign sales growth on total sales
growth.

3. This same analysis was also performed on the combined sample (the two industries), both with and without
a control variable for industry, and the results of these analyses do not differ materially from the separate
industry analyses presented here. The separate analyses are preferable because they illustrate the industry
differences in the slope of the partial derivative.

Discussion
Research aimed at providing a better understanding of the internationalization of
small firms is important. Most firms are small firms, and with increasing technological
advances and globalization, they are facing greater economic pressures to sell outside
their domestic markets. These pressures are exacerbated by public sector entities that
recognize the opportunities for firm growth and community economic development that
successful internationalization can generate (OECD, 1997; UNCTAD, 1994). However,
small firms are inherently vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the market and typically lack
the excess resources needed to withstand setbacks. Foreign market opportunities often

present themselves in a piecemeal fashion and require fast decisions about whether and
how the firm will respond. Thus, it is difficult for small firms to effectively sell in foreign
markets and extant research provides little understanding of the relationship between
foreign sales growth and overall firm growth.
This study presents and tests a model of small firm growth, where the relationship
between foreign sales growth and overall firm growth is moderated by the behavioral integration of the management team. The underlying assumption of the model is that increased
activity in foreign markets increases the environmental complexity faced by small firms,
which, in turn, increases the information processing demands placed on them. Because of
(1) the ad hoc way in which foreign market opportunities often come to the attention of
small firms, (2) the importance of experientially acquired tacit knowledge and timing in
effective internationalization for small firms, and (3) the need for coordination of internationalization activity within small firms, it was hypothesized that these firms’ ability to
make and to implement successful decisions about foreign market opportunities is affected
by the behavioral integration of their management team. Findings support the model.
The generalizability of the findings is increased by the fact that the model was tested
in both a global industry and a multidomestic industry, which are characterized by very
different internationalization requirements and patterns. In general, the model predicts
that because foreign markets are more uncertain and require greater information processing, the behavioral integration of the top management team will have a moderating
effect. Although the behavioral integration of the top management team significantly
moderates the relationship between foreign sales growth and total sales growth for both
the software product and the food processing industries, its effect appears to be more consequential for the food processing firms. This suggests that a behaviorally integrated team
is more consequential for ensuring the contribution of foreign sales growth to overall firm
growth when the environmental complexity of internationalization stems from high
market barriers and a greater liability of foreignness (multidomestic industries) than when

(global industries). This may be due to the fact that firms in multidomestic industries
have a greater potential for piecemeal decisions and actions, given the greater adaptation
that is needed for individual markets.
As always, the study’s limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting
the results. Data were collected from only two industries, and only from firms based in
a single country. It is possible that the behavioral integration of the management team
may be less consequential for Canadian firms (given the Canada/U.S. free trade agreement and the fact that the U.S. is a large, close, “psychically similar” market) than for
firms in countries that face greater uncertainty and larger information processing demands
when internationalizing because they must deal with more numerous and disparate export
markets. This would be particularly likely in the case of multidomestic industries. Furthermore, the sample firms appear to be somewhat more growth oriented than their
populations. The samples are drawn from the best sampling frames available, but are
not perfectly random since no population inventory exists of small firms in either
industry. Therefore, despite the testing in two very different samples, limitations to generalizability may exist, and results should be interpreted with due caution.
The study contributes to the growing body of literature on small firm internationalization. One research stream in this area has emphasized the importance of characteristics of individual owner-managers to the internationalization of their firms, due to their
knowledge, attitudes, contacts, and motives (see, for example, Bloodgood, Sapienza, &
Almeida, 1996; Brush, 1993; McDougall, Shane, & Oviatt, 1994; Preece, Miles, & Baetz,
1998). A second research stream has emphasized the importance of firm-level characteristics, such as organizational processes and networks, to the internationalization of small
firms (see, for example, Autio, Sapienza, & Almeida, 2000; Johanson & Vahlne, 1977,
1990; Reuber & Fischer, 1997; Wiedersheim-Paul, Olson, & Welch, 1978). This study
integrates these two research streams by suggesting that small firms that are able to harness
the resources and capabilities of individual managers in an integrated and coordinated
manner at the firm level are better able to achieve firm growth through foreign sales.
This suggests that future research should pay greater attention to how foreign market
activities are managed in small firms. While foreign market entries have been well studied
(Coviello & McAuley, 1999; Leonidou, 1998) much less attention has been paid to subsequent decisions, and management of cross-border activities on an ongoing basis (cf.
Jones, 1999). The results of this article indicate that these subsequent decisions and
activities are likely to be at least as consequential for firm outcomes as the initial entry
decision. Future research can extend these findings by examining the consequences of
behavioral integration beyond the top management level, to the operational level, where
behavioral integration may be more difficult to maintain as firms become larger and more
complex. A second area of future research is suggested by the nonmonotonic nature of
the moderated relationship, indicating that without an adequate level of top management
team behavioral integration, increased foreign sales can affect firm growth negatively.
Given that coordination and interaction are costly, future research can also examine how
successful firms are able to achieve the required levels in a cost-effective manner. A third
area of future research lies in examining how these findings are affected by the other
component of total sales, domestic sales. If, as has been suggested (Bonaccorsi, 1992),
foreign sales growth is an easier, but not necessarily more effective, means to better
overall performance, then the size and stability of the domestic market might impact the
extent to which small firms can sell effectively in foreign markets.
From a policy perspective, an additional contribution of the study is the attention paid
to small firms in multidomestic industries. A sizable portion of recent research on small
40

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->firm internationalization has focused on high-tech firms in global industries and on the
antecedents and consequences of early foreign market entry (for example, Autio,
Sapienza, & Almeida, 2000; McDougall, Shane, & Oviatt, 1994; Oviatt & McDougall,
1994). In contrast, this study focuses on the ongoing management of foreign sales,
includes both new and established small firms, and studies both a global and a multidomestic industry. Although small firms in a multidomestic industry are likely to enter
foreign markets at an older age than are small firms in a global market (Reuber & Fischer,
1999), their foreign market activities can be equally consequential to firm growth and to
the achievement of the public policy objective of economic development. Indeed, given
the greater number of multidomestic firms in an economy, it could be argued that, in
aggregate, they are likely to yield economic benefits that at least match those of hightech firms if these “lower-tech” firms internationalize effectively.
From a practical perspective, the study provides encouragement for owners and
managers of small firms who are either currently selling in foreign markets, or who are
considering doing so. The findings are consistent with recent studies indicating that
small firms in both global and multidomestic industries are able to overcome liabilities
associated with their size and undertake the often complex, uncertain, and costly activities associated with successful internationalization (McDougall, Shane, & Oviatt, 1994;
Oviatt & McDougall, 1994; Reuber & Fischer, 1997). More important, however, the
study points out the critical role of the management team in managing foreign sales in
an integrated and coordinated manner so that they contribute positively to the overall
growth of the firm. Unlike many of the national and industry level factors affecting the
destinies of small firms (Aldrich, 1999; Venkataraman et al., 1990; Woo, Daellenbach, &
Nicholls-Nixon, 1994), the behavioral integration of the management team is a factor
that is largely under the control of the firm itself. CEOs of small firms can increase the
behavioral integration of the management team by ensuring that managers responsible
for foreign sales interact regularly with other top managers, despite their usually hectic
travel schedules, by establishing frequent and regular forums where the management
team as a whole discusses substantively both ongoing and forthcoming market, product,
and channel issues, and by implementing a reward system that is based on overall firm
performance (cf. Hambrick, 1994). Accordingly, our finding that foreign sales growth
will make more of a contribution to firm growth if there is greater interaction among
management team members and a higher degree of joint decision making constitutes
good news for owners and managers of small firms. It is a message they can act upon.
The nonmonotonic nature of the moderated relationship is of particular practical interest, as it suggests a peril of having managers “outside the loop” when key decisions
are made and actions with enduring implications are taken. In practical terms, for small
firms in both global and multidomestic industries, the message of this study is that
internationalization can be “bad for business” if top managers don’t work effectively
together.
