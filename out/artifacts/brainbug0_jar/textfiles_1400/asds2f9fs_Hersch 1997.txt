I. Introduction
IllinoisInstantRiches, a televised set of three different games of chance, provides a naturalexperimentfor assessing the risk taking behaviorof individuals.Recently,there have been a limited
numberof other studies that have also used game shows as naturalexperiments,including Card
Sharks [6], Jeopardy![11]and The Price Is Right [1]. An advantageof using game shows over
most laboratoryexperiments is the ability to see how individualsrespond to wagers involving
relatively large sums. InstantRiches is particularlyinterestingin this regardbecause it involves
very high stakes. Across the three games played, the potential winnings from wagers offered to
contestantsrangedfrom $2000 to $100,000, losses from $3000 to $35,000, and expected values
from -$10,938 to $15,000.
Given our data,ourprimaryresearchobjectiveis to provideadditionalevidence on the degree
of risk aversionunderhigh stakes wagering. To date, that evidence is mixed. Gertnerconcludes
that CardSharkscontestantsare, on average,risk averse. Metrickcould not reject the hypothesis
that Jeopardy!contestantsare risk neutral.In respective experimentalstudies using Indianpeasant farmersand Chinese universitystudents,Binswanger[2; 3] and Kachelmeierand Shehata [9]
employed small nominal stakes that were nonetheless large relative to their subjects' monthly
incomes (e.g., 20 percent to just over 100 percent of income). Both reporteda shift towardrisk
aversion, as stakes were increased, but in the Kachelmeierstudy the subjects remained largely
risk neutral.In anotherexperimentalstudy, this time involving modest stakes (e.g., hundredsof
dollars) Goodman et al. [7] found expected value to be the best predictorof Las Vegas casino
patrons'certaintyequivalents,a resultimplyingrisk neutrality.In all these studiesthe stakeswere
lower than for InstantRiches.

We take two approachesto assessingrisk aversion.Firstwe regressa contestant'swillingness
to accept an offeredwager on the wager'sexpected value and a proxy for householdincome. That
income is found to be insignificantis consistentwith risk neutrality.It is, however, also consistent
with individualshavinga constantrisk aversionutility function,andwith KahnemanandTversky's
[8; 12] prospect theory of risk taking. In the latter, individualsrespond to changes in income,
ratherthan levels. We are also able to interpretthe expected value coefficients as providingsome
evidence of sensitivity to the magnitudeof gambles.
Our second approachis to directlyestimatethe Pratt-Arrowcoefficient of absoluterisk aversion by assuming alternativespecifications of the utility function. Under both constant absolute
risk aversionand quadraticutility specifications,the results again supporta finding of risk neutrality.We begin the paper with descriptionsof our sample and the games of InstantRiches.

II. Contestant and Game Descriptions
Each week three contestants were chosen randomly from a group of fifteen who had become
eligible to play InstantRiches by scratchingoff three "TV Sets" from a scratch-and-winlottery
ticket.' While not presented, the demographicsof the contestants match favorablywith lottery
players generally and in some regardsare not too differentfrom the overall population.2For example, medianhousehold income for the sample is nearlyidenticalto that of the State of Illinois,
a result consistent with survey data showing that income levels are not correlatedwith lottery
participation.3The sample does differ from the general populationin that it is drawnfrom persons who accepted risk in purchasinglottery tickets. Because of this possible sample selection
bias, caution should be used in generalizing our results to the populationat large.4The sample
does, however, avoid biases that may contaminateother game show studies, where producers
select contestantson the basis of personalityand other subjectiveelements intended to improve
entertainmentcontent.
Each contestant competed individually in one of three games of chance with a specified
wagerand probabilityof winning.Withinand across games, the stakesand/or probabilitiesvaried
from contestantto contestant.Periodically the format of InstantRiches is changed. Our sample
covers games played underthe formatbroadcastbetween 9 July 1994 and 12 August 1995.' The
games are detailed below:

1. In several instances a contestanton stage was playing for a nonspousalrelative or friend. If this person was a
close family member who was present in the audience (e.g., mother) they were kept in the sample. It was also evident
that many contestantswere making their decisions (both positive and negative) in conjunctionwith spouses and other
family membersin the audience.Consequently,the results could be interpretedas household decision makingratherthan
individual decision making.
2. For a comprehensiveanalysis of lottery participationrates see Clotfelter and Cook [4].
3. Ibid.
4. The risk involved in purchasinga single ticket is obviously small ($1), but the more tickets purchasedthe greater
the likelihood of qualifyingfor InstantRiches. A few contestants,however, did mention on the show that they won with
the purchaseof only one ticket or that the ticket was a gift.
5. Priorto 9 July 1994, the formatdid not involve decision making under uncertainty.After 12 August 1995, decision making became more complex as contestantshad to factor in winnings of other contestants.After August 12, the
night's top money winner returnedat the end of the show for a chance to win additionalmonies and returnin future
weeks.

Double Dollars
In this game a contestantpulls a lever, launchinga ping pong ball througha series of bumpers
until it falls randomlyinto one of eight slots. Eachtime a ball falls into an empty slot the contestant
wins $5000. If the slot alreadycontains a ball the contestantreceives a strike.Once the contestant
has two strikes, he must make a choice: either take the money alreadyaccumulated(the stakes)
or take another turn. If upon taking another turn the ball enters an empty slot, his dollars are
doubled;if previously filled, he loses half his stake. For example, if six balls fell into four slots
(four slots empty), he would have a 50 percent chance of winning an additional$20,000 and a
50 percent chance of losing $10,000. Alternatively,if three balls fell into one slot (seven empty)
he would have an 87.5 percent chance of winning an additional$5000 and a 12.5 percent chance
of losing $2,500. As long as the contestantis successful, he can continue to attemptto double his
dollars (and risk losing 50 percent) by taking additionalturns.
We limit our analysis of Double Dollars to a contestant'sfirst decision upon receiving two
strikes, since inclusion of subsequentdecisions by the same contestant would bias the sample
towardless risk-averseand possibly risk-seekingindividuals.For example, suppose there are two
contestantswho both receive their second strike with three slots open and an accumulatedstake
of $25,000. One accepts the wager, the other does not. If the one accepting the wager were
successful, he would continue in the sample and face additionaldecisions. This is not true of the
presumablymore risk averse contestant, who has chosen not to continue.6
The prospect of subsequentrounds does add one additionalcomplexity.If a player is completely rational,his decision to accept a given wager would also be a function of what he would
be willing to do in subsequentroundsif successful. For simplicity,however, we assume bounded
rationalityin the sense thatcontestantsare assumedto ignore possible subsequentattempts.Table
I provides some summarystatistics for this game and the two others described below.

6. Excluding subsequentattemptsalso avoids the problem of repeatedobservationson the same individualsnot
being independent.Correctionof this latter problem would requireestimatinga fixed effects model, which because of
the limited numberof repeated observationswithin the sample is not feasible.

Mismatch
In Mismatch,the contestantblindly reachesinto a bin containingthree balls--a red, a yellow and
a green. Upon selecting a ball, the contestantis given $5000. The object of the game on subsequenttries (withreplacement)is to pick a ball differingin color from the one initiallychosen. For
each successful "mismatch"the contestantearns another$5000. After three attempts,the contestantis given the choice of stoppingand keeping the accumulatedwinnings or playing one final
time. In this attempt,an additionalball matchingthe original color is placed in the bin, making
the odds of winning 50 percent. If the player obtains a mismatch,his winnings are tripled;if he
loses, half of his stake is surrendered.In other words, if successful on each earlierattempt(accumulating$20,000), the contestantwould risk losing $10,000 for a chance of earningan additional
$40,000. Mismatchwas inauguratedin February1995; consequentlythe numberof observations
is limited.7
Force Field
In this game a magnet attachedto a cord is suspendedover a circle analogousto a roulettewheel.
The circumferenceof the circle has ten slots correspondingto the amounts:one, two, three,four,
five, eight, ten, twelve, fifteen and twenty thousand dollars. Each slot also has a magnet. The
contestantshoots the suspendedmagnet over the circle, where by magneticforces (repulsionand
attraction)it is pushed and pulled, until eventually settling randomlyover one of the slots. The
contestantwins the associateddollaramount.The contestantis then requiredto take anotherturn,
but the slot with the dollaramountjust earnedis replacedby a "wipe-out."If the magnetlandson
wipe-out the contestantloses his entire stake. In a thirdand final try, he is faced with three wipeouts: two from dollarreplacementsfrom where the magnetlandedon the previoustwo turns,and
additionallythe lowest dollar amount remainingon the board is replaced by a wipe-out. As an
incentive to take the thirdtry, the highest amountremainingis multipliedby five. Thatis, if in the
firsttwo roundsthe magnet landedon $5,000 and $10,000, then in the thirdroundthe contestant
would have a thirty percent chance of losing $15,000 and a 10 percent chance each of winning
two, three, four, eight, twelve, fifteen and one-hundredthousanddollars.
At the end of the show, the three contestants were brought back to play a fourth game,
Thunderbolt,where one of them would win an amount ranging from $10,000 to $100,000.
Although a game of chance, Thunderboltinvolved no wagering on the part of the players.8

III. The Decision to Accept a Wager
We model a contestant'sdecision to accept an offeredwager as a functionof the wager'sexpected
value and a proxy for contestanthousehold income.9Income was obtained by mappingcontestants' addresses (suppliedby officials of the Illinois Lottery) into Census block groups to obtain
7. Priorto Mismatcha third game existed, but it did not involve decision making underuncertainty.
8. Priorto February1995, a differentfourthgame was played. It too did not involve wagering,but it was possible
for more than one player to receive additionalmonies.
9. In some specifications(notreported)we also includeddummyvariablesfor othercontestantcharacteristics(e.g.,
sex, urban/rural,race, and senior/nonsenior). The coefficients were predominantlyinsignificantand their inclusion does
not alter the reportedresults.These results are consistent with Binswanger[2] who found risk aversionto be independent
of socio-economic characteristics.

Withinthe sample, median
1989 median household income for each contestant'sneighborhood."0
household income (in 1995 dollars) ranged from $10,000 to $181,800. Despite the narrowness
of the geographic area chosen, there can still be considerablevariationin income levels within
a block group. That is, low income neighborhoodscan have high income households and vice
versa. Consequently,some sampling error could be present.
In expected utility theory, under the assumptionof diminishing marginalutility of income
(wealth), contestantsare risk averse and the expected sign of income in the regressionspecification is positive. Underrisk neutrality,the coefficientof income shouldbe zero. Recall that several
previous studies [7; 9; 11], involving relatively moderate to high stakes, found risk neutraltendencies. Within our sample, 32 percent of contestantsthat were offered a wager with a positive
expected gamble rejectedthem, while 17 percent offered a wager with a negative expected value
accepted them. These numberswould not contradicta presumptionof risk neutralityon the part
of the average contestant.
A zero income coefficient does not necessarilyimply risk neutrality,however.For example,
if individualshave a constant risk aversion utility function, the level of income will not matter,
regardlessof whetheror not individualsare risk neutral.Anotherpossibility lies outside expected
utility theory. Kahnemanand Tversky's[8; 12] prospect theory assumes decisions under risk are
based primarilyon changes in income (wealth) ratherthan on its level, a propertyreferredto as
an absence of income integration.Consequently,large differences in initial income levels could
have minimalbearingon wageringdecisions, resultingin the coefficienton income being zero.
The other explanatoryvariable,expected value, is a function of both the probabilityof winning and a game's stakes. In Mismatchand Force Field, probabilityof winning is fixed at 50 and
70 percent, respectively.In Mismatch,the structureof the game is such that accumulatedstake
and expected value have perfect positive correlation."Contrarily,in Force Field, expected value
and accumulatedstake have near perfect negative correlation(p = -0.99).12 Althoughin Double
Dollars both probabilityand stakes are variable,the structureof the game is such that when subsequent rounds are excluded (to avoid sample selection bias), expected value and stakes have a
high negative correlationof -0.85. We make use of these three high correlationsin interpreting
our results.
Table II reportsprobit equationsfor all three games, with the dependentvariableequaling
one for accepted wagers. Equationswere estimated with and without income. When income is
included, its coefficient varies in sign across the games but is insignificantthroughout.As noted
above this resultis consistentwith either 1) the averagecontestantbeing risk neutral,2) a constant
risk aversion utility function or 3) a lack of income integrationin decision making."3
The coefficients of expected value, in the Double Dollars and Force Field equations,are all
10. In fifteen cases, it was not possible to locate the block group area that coincided with the contestant'sstreet
address. In twelve of these cases, township (or village) median income was substituted.In the other three cases it was
necessary to use the more populous zip code area. Three contestants who did not provide a residential address were
dropped from the sample.
11. Let S equal stake. If a contestant wins, the stake is tripled (i.e., the contestant wins an additional2S); if he
loses, he surrenders.5S with equal probability.Therefore,EV = .5(2S) - .5(.5S) = .75S.
12. The reason for the negative correlationis that the more that has been accumulatedon the first two plays, the
less that can be won on the wageredattempt.For example, if in priorroundsthe magnetlandedon $20,000, the most that
could be gained on the wagered round is $75,000. Had the magnet not landed on $20,000, the player would be eligible
to win an additional$100,000.
13. A fourth possibility is that income is correlatedwith educationand more highly educatedindividualsare less
likely to wager. Binswanger[3], however, found no relationshipbetween risk aversion and educationlevels.

positive and statisticallysignificantat p = .01. They are insignificantand of negative sign in Mismatch. Ceterisparibus,contestantsare presumedto be more willing to accept a wager the higher
the expected value, but expected value is not independentof stakesin any of the games. Underexpected utility theory,if playersare risk averse, the likelihood of acceptinga wager should decline
as the magnitudeof the risk (the stakes) increases. Although the income results imply general
risk neutrality,there may be some movement towardrisk aversion as potential losses increase.
If so, for Force Field and Double Dollars, the positive impact of expected value on accepting a
wager is reinforcedby the negative correlationbetween expected value and stakes. In Mismatch,
however, because of the positive correlationbetween stakes and expected value, playersconfront
opposing incentives. The regressionresults suggest that these two forces effectively cancel out,
yielding the insignificantcoefficienton expected value. This interpretationshould be treatedcautiously, however, because of the small Mismatchsample (N = 26) and the asymptoticproperties
of the probit estimators.14
A comparisonof Double Dollars and Mismatchdoes raise one interestinganomaly.At a fundamentallevel the two games are similar-the contestantrisks losing half his stake in accepting
the wager. The difference is that in Mismatchthe contestantcan triple his stake comparedwith
just doubling it in Double Dollars. Consequently,holding probabilityof winning constant (Prob
= .50), one would expect contestantsto be more willing to wager underMismatch.Surprisingly,
the opposite holds. In Double Dollars, twelve contestantsfaced a 50 percent win prospect and
all chose to accept the wager. In Mismatch,only 19 of the 26 contestants(73 percent) accepted
the wager. The lower acceptancerate underMismatchholds even when stakes are held constant.
Underthe statedcriteria,each of the twelve Double Dollars contestantshad accumulateda stake
of $20,000. Of the seven Mismatchcontestantswith $20,000, five acceptedthe wager.One explanation for these results is that contestantscannot correctly calculatethe odds of winning. Given
the very simple nature of these games we discount this possibility. Instead it seems that even
in simple games context mattersand purely psychological factors become importantin deciding
whether or not to accept risk.15
14. It shouldalso be noted thatthe 73.1 percentcorrectpredictionrate for the firstMismatchequationis misleading.
The equationpredicts that all 26 players accepted the wager, and 73.1 percent actually did.
15. For instance,one could speculatethatin these two games the contestantfeels a differentdegree of responsibility

IV. Measuring Risk Aversion
The income results of the preceding section can be used to infer that InstantRiches contestants
are risk neutral when stakes are unarguablylarge. In this section, we adopt the frameworkof
expected utility to directly measurethe Pratt-Arrowcoefficient of absoluterisk aversion,r. With
U representingutility, r = - U"/ U'. It is possible, however, that the assumptionsunderlyingthe
expected utility approachmay be violated. If so, our estimatesof the Pratt-Arrowcoefficientcould
then be taken simply as a "convenientand easily interpretableway to summarizethe average
willingness to accept risk" [6, 510].
Two previous studies using game show data have provided estimates of r. In Card Sharks,
underthe assumptionof constantabsoluterisk aversionand using two differentapproaches,Gertner [6] calculatedthe lower boundon r to be either .000310 or .0000711. Metrick [11],also assuming constantabsoluterisk aversion,could not reject the null hypothesisthatJeopardy!contestants
are risk neutral(r = 0).'6 In Gertner'sand Metrick'sanalysescontestantshad to select the percentage of their stakes they were willing to wager. In InstantRiches, a player must choose between
the alternativesof keeping the accumulatedstake or taking the offered wager. Consequently,we
adopt a discrete choice framework,wherein a player chooses the alternativethat provides the
highest expected utility.17
Utility is assumedto be a function of income, Y, which is initially defined to include outside
income (Yo) plus the gamble's stake (S). For example, in Double Dollars the ith player chooses
between the offered wager with an expected utility of
Uiw = pU(Yo + 2S) + (1 - p)U(Yo + .5S) + Eiw = Viw + Eiw

and the utility of the certain prospect:
Uic = U(Yo

+ S) + Eic =

Vic + Eic,

where p is the probabilityof success and eij is an errorterm for unobservedcharacteristicspertaining to the ith player for the jth choice. The probabilityof this player choosing the wager
is then:
Piw = Prob(Eic - Eiw < Viw - Vic),

which can be estimated once a utility function is specified.
If choice is independentof initial income, a constant risk aversionutility function may be
appropriate.Letting V = -e-rY, then for Double Dollars, Viw- Vicis given by:
-

pe-2rS

-

(1 - p)e-5rS + e-rS

for the wager outcome. Double Dollars is akin to a slot machine, where the player has no control and the machine
determines the outcome. In Mismatch the player reaches into a bin, gropes around, and pulls out a ball. If he (not a
machine) picks a wrong ball, he loses. To avoid being "atfault," the wager is less likely to be taken. The evidence from
psychological experimentsindicates that context does matter.For example, see Ford [5] for a discussion.
16. Metrick speculatedthat Jeopardy!contestantsare wealthierthanthose on CardSharks,reducingtheir risk aversion. The results presented here tend to discount the role of wealth.
17. Train [13]provides a good discussion of discrete choice utility models.

to being risk neutral. Upon substitution,it is straightforwardto show that for Double Dollars
Viw - Vic becomes:19

3(1.5pS- .5S) + -(3.75pS2 -.75S2 + 3pYoS- YoS) = 3Z1+ yZ2.
Since the expression is linear in Z1 and Z2, the coefficients 3 and -y can be estimated using a
standardprobit model absent a constant term.
Unfortunately,to calculate Z2 it is necessary to have a measure of outside income. One
approachis to again use block-groupmedian household income as a proxy for the contestant's
own income. This may, of course, potentiallyintroducea large samplingerrorinto Z2 Ofunknown
bias. Another possibility is that outside income does not matter.That is, outside income is not
integratedinto the decision calculus and decisions are made on the basis of stakes at hand. Given
the insignificance of household income in the regressions of Table II, we cannot dismiss this
possibility. Then Yoshould then be entered as zero in calculatingZ2. We estimate 0 and -Yusing
both approaches.Analogously,expressionsfor Viw - Vic for both the constant risk aversionand
quadraticutility cases can be created for Mismatch and Force Field.20
Results are presentedin TableIII. Under constant absoluterisk aversion (CARA), r is estimated directly.For quadraticutility, r varies across observationsand is a function of contestant
income (Yo+ S or simply S, dependingon the integrationof income). Consequently,the estimates
of 3 and -y are used to calculate an r for each contestantand the mean value is reportedin the
table. Underthe CARA specification(columns1, 4 and 7), the estimatedr coefficientsin all three
games are not significantlydifferentfrom zero at conventionallevels, supportingthe contention
of risk neutralityat high stakes.
In the quadraticutility framework,a positive sign on 0 and negative sign on -y would be
consistent with utility increasingin income but at a diminishingrate. Under the non-integration
of income assumption(columns2, 5 and 8), these are the signs found for all the games. However,
the 0 coefficient is only significantfor Double Dollars and Force Field, at the 1 and 5 percent
levels, respectively,and -yis only significantfor Force Field at the 10 percentlevel. Consequently,
the resultsagain supportthe presence of risk neutrality,except for the weak case from Force Field
pointing to risk aversion.There, estimatedr is .0000168, a value of the same orderof magnitude
as the lower bound estimates reportedby Gertner [6].
Significance levels drop when stake is integratedwith income (columns 2, 6, and 9), with
only 0 in the Double Dollars equation achieving significance at the 5 percent level. If one is
willing to accept our proxy for initial income, the relativelypoor performanceof these equations
calls into question the assumptionof income integration.
18. Quadraticutility functions (or their use as approximations)have been used as the basis for mean-varianceanalysis in financial models. See Markowitz [10] for a discussion.
19. If the player wins, Y = Yo+ 2S. If he loses, Y = Yo+ .5S, and if he does not accept the wager, Y = Yo+ S.
Under quadraticutility, Viw - Vic becomes p[a + 3(Yo+ 2S) + y(Yo + 2S)2] + (1 - p) [a + 3(Yo+.5S) + y(Yo +.5S)2] [a + 3(Yo+ S) + y(Yo + S)2], which simplifies to the expressionin the text.
20. CalculatingViw - Vic for Force Field is straightforward,but the expressionsare a bit unwieldy. This is because
expected utility is based on eight possible outcomes: "wipe-out" with a 30 percent probability,and landing on one of
seven dollar amounts, each with a 10 percent probability.

V. Summaryand Conclusions
Following recent studies in the literature,we have used data from a television game show, Illinois
InstantRiches, as a setting for a naturalexperiment in decision making under uncertainty.An
advantageof using InstantRichesis thatit comprises several simple games of chance, with easily
determinedodds, and very high stakes (up to $100,000). Because we had access to contestant
home addresses,we were able to proxy contestants'householdincomes with Censusblock group
datafrom the contestants'neighborhoods.This in turnenabledus to model the decision to accept
an offered wager as a function of the wager's expected value and contestantincome.
The finding that income was insignificantwas taken as evidence of risk neutralityon the
partof the averagecontestant.The lack of significanceof income is also consistent with prospect
theory developed by Kahnemanand Tversky [8; 12], which also predictsthat income levels will
have minimal effect on risk taking choices. In another set of regressions, by making specific
assumptionson the form of the utility function (constantabsoluterisk aversionor quadraticutility)
we were able to estimatethe Pratt-Arrowcoefficient of absoluterisk aversion.These findingsalso
supportedthe notion of relative risk neutralityunder high stakes. While the weight of evidence
is consistentwith risk neutrality,resultsfrom one game suggest a movementtowardrisk aversion
as the level of risk (stakes) increases.
Because the contestantson InstantRichesare drawnfrom a pool of individualsthatpurchase
"scratchand win" lottery tickets, the conclusions may or may not generalize to the public at
large. It is likely thatthe sampleis less risk averse thanthe generalpopulation.Narrowlyfocused,
however, the results may provide insights into the behaviorof the lottery playing segment of the
population.
