Abstract
Recently, Barron & Erev (2003) demonstrated that individuals making experience-based choices
underweight small probabilities, in contrast to the overweighting observed during decisions in a
typical descriptive paradigm. Here we tested whether the reception of trial by trial feedback in a
repeated descriptive paradigm would engender choices more correspondent with the experiential
or descriptive paradigms. The results of a repeated gambling task indicated that individuals
receiving feedback underweighted small probabilities, relative to their no feedback counterparts,
implicating feedback as a critical component during the decision making process, even in the
presence of fully specified descriptive information. A model comparison at the individual
subject level suggested that feedback drove individuals‟ decision weights towards objective
probability weighting.

Feedback Produces Divergence from Prospect Theory in Descriptive Choice
On June 19th, 1986, a college student died in his dorm room from cocaine intoxication.
This was no ordinary student: it was Len Bias, who two days earlier was drafted second overall
by the Boston Celtics basketball team. Bias – whose talent was sometimes compared to Michael
Jordan‟s– was about to sign a contract worth more than imaginable while growing up;
unfortunately, a poor decision cut short all of his opportunities.
Even though it was well established by this time that cocaine use, in rare circumstances,
could result in death, it might be said that Bias “underweighted” the small probability of this
most terrible outcome. He had observed the repeated choices of his friends who consistently
obtained the pleasant outcome of drug use as opposed to the fatal outcome (The New York Times,
1987). This is a real-world example of the important difference between descriptive and
experiential choice. Although Bias almost certainly knew descriptively that cocaine use had as a
possible outcome the rare event of death, he also experienced (through his friends and his own
use) that this tragic outcome was rare. Recent laboratory experiments confirm that people make
different decisions based on experiential versus descriptive information (Barron & Erev, 2003).
We are interested in 1) what makes people choose differently across these two paradigms and 2)
what theoretical component of the decision process incorporates the dynamics causing this
difference.
Descriptive choice paradigms are the basis of most models of decision making. In the
descriptive paradigm, participants choose between options, with possible outcomes and
probabilities of each outcome fully described1. For many years, economists assumed that

<-----Page 3----->Feedback Produces

4

individuals behaved according to a rational theory called expected utility theory (EUT;
Bernoulli, 1738/1954; von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944); Kahneman and Tversky later
proposed prospect theory (PT; 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) to account for many
systematic violations of EUT observed in descriptive choice. PT incorporated into EUT, among
others, three new concepts: overweighting of small probabilities (where small probability events
are considered more likely to occur than in reality), the risk reflection effect (where people avoid
risk when choosing between gains but seek risk when choosing between losses), and loss
aversion (where losses have more impact than gains of equal magnitude). The first two concepts
allow PT to account for an interesting pattern of preferences for risky choices. To illustrate,
consider the following option pairs:
A1: 3 for sure
B1: 4 with probability .8; else 0
A2: 3 for sure
B2: 32 with probability .1; else 0
When all outcomes are positive, A1 is preferred over B1, whereas B2 is preferred over A2; but
when all outcomes are negative, B1 is preferred over A1 whereas A2 is preferred over B2. Thus,
the following four-fold pattern is observed in descriptive choice: risk aversion when the risky
gamble has a high probability to win or low probability to lose, and risk seeking when the risky
gamble has a low probability to win or a high probability to lose.
Because humans can understand and work with symbols representing probabilities and
values, descriptive choice is possible; but, non-humans are unable to choose descriptively;
therefore, choices by animals represent experiential choice. In contrast to the predictions of PT,

<-----Page 4----->Feedback Produces

5

the choices of bees (Real, 1987) are best described as underweighting of small probabilities, a
behavioral pattern also observed in human experiential choice (Benartzi & Thaler, 1995; Thaler,
Tversky, Kahneman, & Schwartz, 1997; Weber, Shafir, & Blais, 2004; Newell & Rakow, in
press)
To gain a better understanding of the difference between experiential and descriptive
choice, Barron & Erev (2003) examined several core concepts of PT using an experiential choice
paradigm. Specifically, participants learned about the distribution of outcomes through repeated
choice and subsequent feedback; no descriptive information about possible outcomes and their
likelihoods of occurring were given beyond the post-choice feedback. Remarkably, they
observed that in all but one of the cases they tested the patterns of preference were the opposite
of what PT predicted. For example, underweighting of small probabilities was observed in
experiential choice rather than the overweighting posited by PT. In other words, the converse of
PT best predicted the results!
Naturally, several possible explanations exist for this discrepant behavior between
descriptive and experiential paradigms. First, the experiential paradigm requires individuals to
learn about payoff distributions whereas the descriptive paradigm informs individuals about
payoff distributions; thus, learning represents a key component of the experiential choice
paradigm. As a result, learning is typically not included in theories derived from descriptive
choice; in contrast, theories derived from experiential choice include learning mechanisms,
typically reinforcement learning (e.g., Sutton & Barton, 1998; Erev & Barron, 2005; Busemeyer
& Stout, 2002).

<-----Page 5----->Feedback Produces

6

Second, the experiential paradigm requires repeated choice whereas the descriptive
paradigm is often conducted using a single choice. Hertwig, Barron, Weber, and Erev (2004)
sought to eliminate this methodological difference as an explanation by allowing participants in
the experiential condition to “sample” from the options in order to learn about the distribution of
payoffs, but the observed samples were not considered choices. After sampling to their
satisfaction, participants made a single choice for which they would receive payment. Thus,
participants in both the descriptive and experiential conditions made one relevant choice; again,
participants in the experiential condition behaved conversely to PT (Hertwig et al., 2004).
It‟s possible that the underweighting of rare events in this paradigm may simply result
from sampling bias (Fox & Hadar, 2006; Hertwig et al., 2004; Rakow, Demes, & Newell, 2007).
That is, in the experiential condition, participants do not know the true payoff distribution: they
only observe a small sample. With small samples, rare events are likely to be underrepresented,
and so resultant behavior would correspond with small probability underweighting. For
example, when a sample of N=7 draws is taken from a distribution paying 64 with a probability
of .05, otherwise nothing, the 64 outcome will rarely occur, effectively rendering the expected
payoff equal to 0. However, even in experiments with relatively large samples (e.g., Barron &
Erev, 2003, used >100 trials), small probabilities are underweighted. Consequently, the
sampling bias explanation cannot account for the entire paradigmatic difference.
Third, the experiential paradigm requires feedback whereas the descriptive paradigm
does not. Yechiam and Busemeyer (2006) observed that when given descriptive information and
feedback about the outcome of their choice, individuals reverse preference with experience.

<-----Page 6----->Feedback Produces

Specifically, individuals were given an endowment and then chose repeatedly between the
following two risky gambles:
A3: Lose 8 with probability .005; else lose 2
B3: Lose 300 with probability .005; else lose 1
Individuals initially preferred the riskier option (B3), but after feedback eventually came
to prefer the safer option (A3)2. However, some unique features of this task prevent strong
conclusions about PT-convergent versus divergent behavior: 1) the payoff structure involved
only risky gambles as opposed to completely safe alternatives, 2) individuals were guaranteed to
lose money on each trial, and 3) the probabilities involved were extreme and very rarely
experienced. These features preclude this work from being considered a strong test of PT
assumptions.
On the basis of the above results, we hypothesized that feedback is the crucial arbiter
dictating whether participants underweight or overweight small probabilities. To test this
feedback hypothesis in isolation, we held constant the repeated nature of the two methods and
eliminated the necessity of learning about payoff distributions, allowing only the feedback
component to vary. Further, we wanted to specifically focus on the observation that when
outcomes are positive, small probabilities are overweighted in descriptive choice but are
underweighted in experiential choice. Consequently, we tested both the upper and lower
portions of the probability spectrum insuring that any observed underweighting was not
attributable to expected value adherence with repeated choice.
We predicted that when outcome feedback was not given, individuals would conform to
PT and overweight small probabilities, thus preferring a small certain win over a risky high

<-----Page 7----->Feedback Produces

8

probability gamble, but preferring a risky low probability gamble over the same small certain
win. Conversely, when given feedback, we predicted individuals would underweight small
probabilities and show the opposite choice pattern.
Additionally, we were interested in discerning which theoretical component of the
decision process incorporated the dynamics producing such behavioral disparities between the
two paradigms. In correspondence with our prediction that people would overweight small
probabilities when not receiving feedback but underweight them when receiving feedback, we
predicted that the theoretical analysis would reveal that the feedback manipulation affected a
probability weighting parameter.
The model used for this theoretical analysis was a modified version of decision field
theory (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993). Decision field theory is a dynamic and stochastic
model of choice accounting for a wide variety of empirical findings within both the descriptive
and experiential choice paradigms (Busemeyer & Diederich, 2002; Busemeyer, Johnson, &
Jessup, 2006). In decision field theory, attention switches between outcomes with the amount of
attention applied to each outcome a function of the probability of receiving that outcome. This
attention-switching activity results in a relative preference for each outcome at each moment and
these preferences change over time until preference for one option surpasses a threshold, at
which point that option is chosen. Other probabilistic choice models could have been applied to
this data set; consequently, our model analysis was not a test of decision field theory but rather a
tool for examining which parameters changed because of the feedback manipulation.
To address the prediction concerning the weighting of small probabilities, a probability
weighting function modified the attention-switching activity of decision field theory (Prelec,

<-----Page 8----->Feedback Produces

9

1998). In this model, small probabilities can be overweighted (probability weighting parameter
λ<1), underweighted (λ>1) or objectively weighted (λ=1). The exact computation for decision
field theory and the probability weighting function can be found in the Appendix.
Methods
Twenty nine participants were recruited from Indiana University and completed 120 trials
for both conditions (counterbalanced) of a repeated measures design experiment. The High
Probability (HP) condition consisted of a choice between the following two options:
Option HP_S: win 3 cents for sure
Option HP_R: win 4 cents with probability .8; else 0
The Low Probability (LP) condition consisted of these choices:
Option LP_S: win 3 cents for sure
Option LP_R: win 64 cents with probability .05; else 0
Participants were randomly assigned to No Feedback (NFB; n = 15) and Feedback (FB; n
= 14) groups. Both groups received all descriptive information about the gambles and made
repeated choices. The only difference was that the FB group received feedback indicating their
winnings on the previous trial whereas the NFB group did not.
Because we anticipated that individuals would experience boredom when confronted with
the exact same decision repeatedly, especially when not receiving feedback, the win amount for
the risky gamble varied slightly on each trial, with the minimum expected value for the risky
gamble equated with the sure thing option. A total of five different expected values were shown

<-----Page 9----->Feedback Produces

10

for the risky gamble (range(EV) = [3, 3.4]) for both conditions, and the five different expected
values were equated across both conditions. The risky gamble with an expected value of 3.2 was
shown twice as often as the other four gambles. Furthermore, a post-task item assessed the
extent to which participants were bored by the task on a 1-5 Likert scale, ranging from „Very
slightly or not at all‟ to „Extremely‟.
Participants received instruction and training and completed several practice trials before
beginning the procedure. Further, they learned that the amount of money they would earn
depended on their choices. On each trial, they observed pie charts indicating the amount of
money that could be won with the size of the pie pieces indicating the probability of winning the
displayed amounts. At the end of the experimental session, they were paid $7 for their time as
well as the amount of their cumulative winnings.
Note that four patterns of responding were possible: 1) individuals could adhere to
expected value and consequently prefer the risky gamble in each pair (HP_R and LP_R), 2);
individuals could be risk-averse and choose the sure thing in each pair (HP_S and LP_S), 3);
individuals could choose in accordance with PT and thus overweight small probabilities
(choosing HP_S and LP_R), 4); or they could choose in opposition to PT and underweight small
probabilities (choosing HP_R and LP_S).
Results
Statistical Analyses
Figure 1 shows the preference for the sure thing option relative to the risky gamble (LP
condition in the upper portion, HP condition below) for the FB and NFB groups, plotted as a

<-----Page 10----->Feedback Produces

11

function of blocks of ten trials. We hypothesized that descriptive choice with no feedback would
result in overweighting of small probabilities whereas descriptive choice with feedback would
result in underweighting of small probability events. This prediction was supported by the data.
The probability of choosing the sure thing was analyzed with a mixed ANOVA, using Condition
(LP or HP) and Block (12 blocks of ten trials each) as within subjects factors, and Group (NFB
or FB) as a between subjects factor. There was a significant Group x Condition interaction (F1,27
= 4.76, p < .05, Cohen‟s f =.41) . No other comparison was significant at the .05 level.
[Insert Figure 1]
Whereas the NFB group behavior generally conformed to theories derived from a
descriptive paradigm (e.g., PT), participants in the FB condition behaved otherwise,
underweighting the small probabilities relative to their NFB counterparts. Consequently,
feedback alone was enough to drive participants to underweight small probability events. It is
possible that the NFB group experienced more boredom in the task than the FB group and that
this boredom accounts for any observed behavioral difference. However, responses to the
boredom assessment item did not significantly differ across groups (t24 = 1.25, p = .22).
Theoretical Analyses: Which Parameter did Feedback Alter
The FB group may have appeared to underweight small probabilities relative to those in
the NFB group, but which theoretical component in decision field theory varied between groups
to produce the differential behavior? There are several possibilities including changes to the (a)
weight or attention given to probabilities, (b) utility function capturing risk seeking and risk
aversion tendencies, or (c) threshold controlling the tendency to maximize utility or choose
randomly; these concepts are represented by the free parameters λ, α, and θ, respectively.

Decision field theory was fit to the choice probabilities for each individual‟s data. Table
1 shows the medians of the best fitting parameters that maximized the likelihood of each
subject‟s choices. The decision field theory likelihoods were compared to the likelihoods of a
fully saturated baseline model, a model which perfectly reproduced the choice probabilities for
each gamble pair. This comparison used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz,
1978, which penalizes models for each additional parameter; thus, adding extra parameters will
not necessarily improve the BIC (see the Appendix for information concerning the estimation
procedure, baseline model, and computation of the BIC). The BIC indicated that decision field
theory provided a superior fit on 13 out of 15 NFB participants and 11 out of 14 FB participants
and consequently fit the data quite well3. Figure 2 presents the observed choice behavior and
model predictions. The plots were generated by obtaining the predictions from the best fitting
parameter values at the individual level and using the mean of these predictions.
Insert Figure 2
We then compared the obtained best fitting parameters across the two conditions. As a
reminder, we predicted that the probability weighting parameter λ would account for the different
choice behavior across groups. As predicted, the λ parameter was higher in the FB group than
the NFB group, indicating that individuals who received feedback underweighted small
probabilities relative to their NFB counterparts. A Mann Whitney U test of the three free
parameters revealed that only the probability weighting parameter λ differed significantly
between groups, z=2.25, p<.05. However, as Table 1 demonstrates, λ≈1 for the FB group, and
thus does not reflect underweighting, but rather objective weighting of small probabilities.
Insert Table 1

To summarize, the data conformed to our predictions of PT-convergent behavior when
feedback was not provided (as indicated by overweighting of small probabilities) but PTdivergent behavior when feedback was provided (as indicated by relative underweighting of
small probabilities). A theoretical analysis supported the above finding, showing that feedback
specifically altered the probability weighting parameter. But, this analysis also revealed that
feedback coupled with description drives subjective probabilities towards their objective values.
Discussion
The results of this study implicate feedback as the crucial arbiter between experiential
and descriptive choice. Apparently, feedback overwhelms descriptive information and drives
individuals toward the objective probabilities (as indicated by λ≈1 in FB group). Due to the task
design, the difference cannot be attributed to sampling bias.
The findings are interesting for a variety of reasons. First, that feedback alone drives
individuals to the objective probabilities bears relevance to many current studies. For example,
in most studies testing behavioral models of choice, feedback is often not provided. However,
neuroimaging studies concerned with substrates and networks of reward and decision
mechanisms typically provide feedback after each trial. Consequently, the observed neural
substrates of choice may not correspond with the neural mechanisms actually used in the
behavioral studies that inspired them!
Second, these results suggest that previous observations of small probability
underweighting in experience-based tasks might possibly be described as objective probability
weighting coupled with risk aversion. In several of the cases reporting underweighting of
unlikely events, a utility parameter was not applied to the outcomes; the failure to do so could

<-----Page 13----->Feedback Produces

14

produce the appearance of underweighting. However, these other cases (e.g., Barron & Erev,
2003; Hertwig et al., 2004) also differed from our experiment by not including descriptions in
the experiential condition. Thus, feedback coupled with description might be needed for
approximately objective weighting.
These results do not implicate feedback as the sole factor determining whether or not
small probability events are overweighted, as several other factors could still be involved; the
fact that the median best fitting probability weighting parameter across NFB individuals was
higher than usual attests to this. This mildly atypical finding could have been driven by the small
outcomes, parametric modulation of the risky outcomes, or repeated nature of the task.
However, this does not minimize the observation of significantly different behavior based only
on the reception of feedback.
Though a particular model analysis (decision field theory) was reported here, we actually
considered multiple models, as our objective was to use a model applicable both when feedback
was and was not given (and thus no learning occurred). For the FB participants, we compared 11
other models, including models with delta and Bayesian learning rules, and also a softmax choice
rule (Sutton & Barto, 1998). However, these models produced inferior BIC scores relative to the
no learning implementation of decision field theory; the inferiority of the learning models was
likely due to the swiftness of learning. Possibly, the feedback coupled with the descriptions
combined to produce rapid learning (c.f. Stout, Rock, Campbell, Busemeyer, & Finn, 2005).
To conclude, these results indicate that individuals respond differently depending upon
whether they receive feedback after their choices, even when provided with complete descriptive
information. Further, this suggests that feedback plays a crucial role in differentiating between

<-----Page 14----->Feedback Produces

15

experiential and descriptive choice behavior. The observed behavioral difference has
implications for behavioral choice theories in economics and psychology as well as
neurophysiological studies seeking to uncover the neural substrates underlying choice behavior.

Appendix
Decision Field Theory
In decision field theory, preference for an option accumulates at each time step in
accordance with a diffusion process until preference for an option exceeds a preset threshold.
This particular implementation of decision field theory corresponds with a Wiener process (see
Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993, Appendix):

(1)

where the term on the left denotes the probability of choosing option i out of the set of all options
X. The drift rate d is the difference between the mean valences of the two options, the diffusion
rate σ is the square root of the sum of the variance of the two options, and the threshold θ
represents the absorbing boundary to which preference accumulates. The drift rate d is
computed as follows:

(2)

Vi represents the mean valence for option i and is derived according to:

<-----Page 19----->Feedback Produces

20

(3)

In the above equation, wij represents the attention weight given to outcome j when considering
option i, and xijα represents the utility of outcome j produced by option i. The parameter α is a
utility parameter; α<1 denotes decreasing sensitivity to differences in outcome magnitude as
magnitude increases. The attention weights were computed from a formula proposed by Prelec
(1998) which takes the following form:

(4)

Here, p is the objective probability of an outcome and λ is the probability weighting parameter.
The diffusion rate σ was computed as follows:

(5)

Consequently, the parameters d and σ were derived from the stimuli and the parameters λ
and α were free to vary. The third free parameter was the standardized threshold, θ/σ.

<-----Page 20----->Feedback Produces

21

Maximum Likelihood Estimation
The parameter values which maximized the likelihood of the data were estimated
according to:

(A1)

where LL is the log likelihood of the data given the model parameter values, yi is the
number of times option i was chosen, ŷM represents the predicted choice proportion for the model
M ; N=10 different gamble pairs, five in each condition. C is a constant that cancels out and is
thus ignored. Maximum likelihood estimation was performed in Matlab using the robust
combination of a simplex search (Nelder & Mead, 1965) and multiple random starting points.
Saturated Baseline Model
The baseline model used here experiment assumed that a multinomial process generates
choices (see Busemeyer & Stout, 2002). This baseline model perfectly reproduces the actual
choice probabilities for each of the gamble pairs and consequently has a likelihood of 1.
However, the model has one free parameter for each of the gamble pairs and is thus punished by
the BIC due to the large number of free parameters.
Model Comparison
The BIC was used to compare the performances of the baseline model and decision field
theory. The formula for the BIC is:

<-----Page 21----->Feedback Produces

22

(A2)

Here, k represents the difference in the number of degrees of freedom for the two models
being compared (7) and N is the number of data points (i.e., 240 trials, since the models are
compared at the individual level). In this formulation, positive BIC values indicate better model
performance for decision field theory than the saturated model.

Descriptive choice is distinct from descriptive theories of choice that seek to describe how

people choose, in contrast with normative theories which explain what people should choose.
2

At first glance these results seem to contradict other work using completely described gambles

with a similar payoff structure, using groups making a single descriptive choice (to be played
100 times) or 100 choices with feedback after every trial (Yechiam, Barron, & Erev, 2005). In
that work, individuals choosing descriptively preferred the safe option but those choosing
experientially preferred the risky option. However, that experiment consisted of 100 trials
whereas the Yechiam and Busemeyer (2006) task consisted of 400 trials, analyzed in blocks of
50. Consequently, it‟s possible that on the first trial individuals preferred the safe option, then
quickly moved towards the risky option and only after 100 trials began the approach towards
expected value maximization, favoring the safe option.

Median R2 values were .91 and .84 for the NFB and FB groups, respectively. It is possible that

these values could be improved upon because we 1) maximized the likelihood rather than R2 and
fit the individual as opposed to the group data. We also tested the nested models within this
decision field theory implementation and found that the three parameter version produced
superior BIC scores.

Note. All data was fit at the individual level. BIC is positive where decision field theory
outperformed the baseline model. Parameters: λ is a decision weight parameter from Prelec
(1998); θ controls the extent to which a participant behaves deterministically; α is a utility
parameter. NFB = No Feedback; FB = Feedback; BIC = Bayesian Information Criteria.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Choice probability for the sure thing for the feedback (dashed lines) and no feedback
(solid lines) groups, in 12 blocks of 10 choices. The upper portion shows choice probability
from the low probability gamble pair. The plots on the far right indicate the overall mean choice
behavior collapsed across blocks. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
Figure 2. Aggregate model fits for feedback (dashed lines) and no feedback groups (solid lines).
These were obtained by fitting the model to the observed individual data („X‟ for feedback and
„O‟ for no feedback) and averaging the predictions across participants. There were five different
risky gambles in each condition and the sure thing was always 3 cents. The vertical axis gives
the choice probability for the sure thing and the horizontal axis gives the value of the risky
gamble. The probability of winning the risky amount in the LP gamble (left) was 0.05 and 0.80
in the HP gamble. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean for the observed
choice probabilities.
