Measurement of Specific Interpersonal Trust:
Construction and Validation of a Scale to Assess
Trust in a Specific Other

Scales were developed for the assessment of one individual's trust in another in
meaningful interpersonal relationships. For male subjects, the scale includes factors of reliableness, emotional trust, and general trust. For female subjects, similar, but not identical, reliableness and emotional trust factors emerged. The scales
demonstrate adequate reliability and are discriminable from the related constructs
of liking and love. The scales were empirically validated in two experiments. In
Experiment 1, subjects' responses on the Reliableness subscale varied appropriately as a function of the reliable or nonreliable behavior of the target person.
In Experiment 2, subjects' responses on the Emotional Trust subscale varied
appropriately when the target person either betrayed or did not betray a confidence. In both experiments, the appropriate subscale was more sensitive to experimental manipulations than were the other trust subscales, attesting to the
discriminant validity of the trust factors.

Interpersonal trust is a basic feature of all
social situations that demand cooperation
and interdependence. Whether loaning
money, forming a car pool, or visiting a physician, one must decide whether the risk of
becoming vulnerable or dependent is worth
the possibility of a shared positive outcome.
It is this element of risk—that is, despite a
careful assessment of the other person's intentions, capabilities, ^and motives, one can
never be certain of a satisfactory outcome—
that gives the trust dilemma its basic character. Within an interpersonal bargaining relationship, trust has been described as involving
two parties who are to a certain extent interdependent
with respect to the outcomes denned by their joint
choices, and one of the parties (P) is confronted with the
choice between trusting or not trusting the other (O).
. . . It is important to note that both P and O are cognizant of the risk to which P exposes himself in his decision to trust O.. . . That is, P knows that O can betray
him and O knows that P has extended his (P's) trust
even in the face of that risk. (Kee & Knox, 1970, pp.
358-359)

Risk is also implicit in Carl Rogers's (1961)

description of the client's initial feeling:
I'm afraid of him, I want help, but I don't know whether
to trust him. He might see things which I don't know
in myself—frightening and bad elements. He seems not
to be judging me, but I'm sure he is. I can't tell him
what really concerns me, but I can tell him about some
past experiences which are related to my concern.
(P. 67)

While willingness to take risks may be one
of the few characteristics common to all trust
situations, willingness to exhibit trust in any
given situation will be determined by a variety of more specific factors. For example,
the individual you trust to feed your cat while
you are on vacation may not be trusted to
repair your car, and your trusted mechanic
may not be your chosen target for intimate
self-disclosures. The present research explicitly acknowledges the situation- and targetspecific nature of interpersonal trust as well
as the variety of connotations the word trust
possesses. This emphasis contrasts with research focusing on general predispositions to
trust.
The Interpersonal Trust Scale (Rotter,
1967, 1971, 1980) and the Philosophies of
Human Nature Scale (Wrightsman, 1966)
were both developed to measure the general
tendency of an individual to trust others.

<-----Page 1----->INTERPERSONAL TRUST

High trusters emerge as independent and
trustworthy (Rotter, 1971), honest (Steinke,
1975), and open to seeking psychological
help (Fisher & Turner, 1970). But to relate
trust only to positive personal attributes is a
disservice to those who, for very good reasons, refuse to trust a specific other person.
To blindly trust the seller of a used car, the
leader of a cult, or even the president of one's
country is at best naive and potentially dangerous. Further, the capacity of these scales
to predict trust in others is restricted to conditions of very limited intimacy (Chun &
Campbell, 1974; Kaplan, 1973). Finally, because such scales predict a willingness to trust
across target persons and situations, they do
not accurately determine an individual's
trust in another under particular circumstances. Rotter (1971) theorizes that trust,
assessed by his scale, is most accurate in
highly ambiguous, novel, or unstructured situations, where one's generalized expectancy
is all one can rely on. This observation is
consistent with Mischel's (1973) acknowledgement of the limited usefulness of trait
measures when the individual is experiencing
"powerful treatments."
Mixed-motive games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma (Deutsch, 1958, 1960)have
been used to study both individual difference
measures which correlate with cooperative
behavior and situational factors which promote cooperation. Thus, high authoritarians
(Deutsch, 1960) and those who are basically
competitively oriented (Kelley & Stahelski,
1970) tend not to cooperate. The power of
situational variables (competitive, cooperative, or individualistic orientation) and communication format in influencing cooperation (Rubin & Brown, 1975) has been documented. But despite modifications of the
game paradigms to approximate real-world
situations (Brickman, Becker, & Castle, 1979;
Rapoport & Chammah, 1965) and attempts
to explicate cognitive analogs of behavioral
cooperation (Kimmel, Pruitt, Magenau,
Konar-Goldband, & Carnevale, 1980; Messe
& Sivacek, 1979; Ross, Green, & House,
1977), game research still has limited applicability. Individuals bring to the experiment
implicit notions about game playing and face
a partner who is, at best, a stranger and, at
worst, an experimenter's programmed strat-

1307

egy. In these rare cases where the Prisoner's
Dilemma game is played between friends
(Oskamp & Perlman 1966), greater cooperation results. Thus, most bargaining research
does little to extend notions about trust to
personally meaningful others.
Intimate interpersonal relationships have
both a history and a future. They are not
static laboratory still frames nor can they be
explained purely in terms of each individual's personal characteristics, dynamics, or
style. If John is involved in a relationship
with Marsha, whether he trusts her to keep
a secret is apt to be based on beliefs about
her personality, her past history of betrayal
of confidences, and the current climate of
their association. John's general trust in people and whether he is usually willing to trust
his Congressman or insurance agent or even
whether he trusts Marsha to remember appointments may be only marginally relevant.
To understand trusting relationships,
therefore, we need to deal with specific trust:
both trust in a specific other person and a
specific type of trust. There is a clear analog
between this research and that of Rubin
(1970), whose interest in positive interpersonal affect resulted in the development of
scales assessing degrees of both liking and
loving between particular individuals rather
than general levels of warmth toward humanity.
Systematic investigation of specific interpersonal trust and its relationship to other
variables such as love, liking, and self-disclosure has been hampered by the lack of a valid
instrument of measurement. This article reports on the construction and validation of
a scale for use in interpersonal relationship
research. In particular, the scale is geared toward measurement of the varieties of interpersonal trust held by one individual for a
specific other person. Details of scale construction are followed by reports of two experiments designed to validate the scale and
demonstrate its usefulness.

Through discussions with others and reviews of the theoretical literature dealing with

interpersonal trust, 50 items describing hypothetical situations thought to involve trust
in another were generated. Items generally
fell into one of four a priori categories: trusting another with one's material possessions,
a belief in the other's dependability or reliability, trusting another with personal confidences, and trusting another with one's
physical safety. A few items did not fall into
any of these categories, and a few seemed to
span more than one.
The 50 items, half keyed in the negative
direction, were presented to 15 judges with
instructions to rate each item for its importance as a determinant of trust. The 43 items
with the highest interjudge agreement were
retained. To assess discriminant validity,
these 43 items were randomly interspersed
with Rubin's (1970) 13-item Liking and Loving scales, which shared the same format with
the trust items.
Method
Subjects. A total of 180 male and 255 female undergraduates in introductory psychology courses at Tufts
University completed the inventory during class time.
Procedure. Subjects were instructed to think of a specific other person the same sex as themselves in whom
they had a great deal of trust (as defined by the subject).
Responses on 9-point scales, anchored by "strongly
agree" and "strongly disagree," were subjected to a principal-components factor analysis, followed by both orthogonal (varimax) and oblique rotations using the
BMDP-08M factor analysis program (Dixon, 1975).

Results
Questionnaire responses were analyzed in
two stages. First, responses to the full 69-item
questionnaire were factor analyzed to determine if trust, love, and liking are discriminable concepts. Second, a factor analysis of
the 43 trust item responses was conducted.
For male respondents, orthogonal and
oblique rotations yielded essentially identical
factors. A general trust factor emerged, with
12 trust items having substantial loadings
(denned here as at least ±.40 on one rotation
and ±.25 on the other, both ps < .01). No
Loving or Liking scale item loaded significantly on this factor. An 8-item factor comprising only Loving scale items, and a 9-item
factor comprising 8 Liking scale items and
one trust item also emerged. A fourth factor

comprised 8 trust and one Liking scale item,
and a fifth factor consisted of 7 trust items.
For female respondents, orthogonal and
oblique rotations also yielded similar identifiable factors. However, these female factors
were quite distinct in composition from the
male factors. Factor 1 consisted of 8 trust
items, all related to dependability. Factor 2
consisted of 10 items, all from Rubin's Loving scale. A third factor comprised 7 items,
6 of which were Liking scale items. Factor
4 consisted of 4 Liking scale and 3 trust
items; Factor 5, 5 trust items; and Factor 6,
7 trust and one Loving scale item.
Since the loving, liking, and trust items
tended to form separate factors, clear-cut evidence for discriminant validity was demonstrated. Their function fulfilled, the Loving and Liking scales were therefore eliminated, and responses to the 43 trust items
were factor analyzed to determine the factor
structure of the trust construct itself.
Components of trust: Male sample. For
male subjects, four interpretable factors
emerged. Orthogonal and oblique rotations
yielded essentially identical solutions. Table
1 summarizes the results of the orthogonal
rotation. Factor 1 appears to be a general
trust factor, with items spanning a wide variety of interpersonal situations and a priori
categories. Factor 2 was labeled Emotional
Trust, since these items refer to situations
involving confiding, freedom from criticism
and embarrassment, and other emotion-laden
situations. Factor 3 (Reliableness) deals with
keeping promises and commitments, and
Factor 4 (Dependability) is characterized by
a confidence in the other's help or assistance
when needed and in the other's sense of responsibility.
Components of trust: Female sample. For
female subjects, three factors emerged, which
were similar for both rotations. As Table 1
indicates, Factor 1 is an amalgam of the male
Factors 3 and 4 and is called Reliableness.
Factor 2 closely resembles the male Factor
2 and is also called Emotional Trust. However, this factor, unlike the male Factor 2,
includes an element of the other's credibility
or honesty. Factor 3 (Physical Trust) concerns one's physical safety and well-being.
That this factor did not emerge for males
may reflect societal norms dictating that

their physical dependence upon others. It is
also noteworthy that no general trust factor
was found for females to parallel the male

females to make fine discriminations when
rating another's trustworthiness, responding
instead with a more global perception.

another as reliable or unreliable. Specifically,
subjects were paired with a partner who behaved in either a reliable or unreliable manner toward them and were then asked their
impressions of their partner on the SITS. It
was hypothesized, first, that reliable rather
than unreliable partners would receive higher
trust ratings on all subscales and, second, that
there would be a greater difference between
ratings of reliable and unreliable partners on
the Reliableness subscale than on the other
subscales. Such a finding would provide evidence of discriminant validity.

munication. First, subject pairs would be asked to solve
a series of coordination problems without direct communication. Second, they would be working directly
with their partners to solve additional problems. They
were further told that they would receive feedback about
their joint performance after each part and that they
would be asked to answer questions about their partners
at various times. After 5 min., the experimenter returned
to answer questions. She then explained that there would
be a delay before the experiment could begin. In the
high-trust condition, the experimenter explained:

Method

At the end of 10 min., the experimenter returned, apologized for the delay, and handed the subject a copy of
the eight coordination problems, adopted from Schelling
(1960). Subjects were told they would have 10 min. to
answer the problems. In the low-trust condition, the experimenter explained:

Subjects. Twenty male and 20 female undergraduates
enrolled in lower level psychology courses at Tufts University volunteered to fulfill a course requirement. Fifty
subjects were scheduled for the experiment, but 5 did
not keep their appointments and, due to the nature of
the experimental manipulation, could not be rescheduled. Five others revealed suspicions about the manipulations and were excluded from the analyses. All remaining subjects arrived on time for the experiment,
which was vital for the effectiveness of the manipulation.
Design and overview. Ten males and 10 females were
randomly assigned to the reliable and the unreliable partner conditions. Subjects were told that they would be
participating in an interpersonal coordination experiment with another person. The reliableness of the partner was manipulated by portraying the partner as arriving either on time or 10 minutes late after all subjects
were specifically asked to be prompt for the appointment. After the manipulation, subjects solved the coordination problems,, filled out the SITS for their partner, and were debriefed and dismissed.
Procedure, Subjects were contacted individually by
telephone to arrange appointments for the experiment.
The experimenter explained that the study involved interpersonal coordination between pairs of subjects and
added:
I just want to emphasize one more thing. It's really
important that you keep this appointment if you tell
me that you can make it. Since I'm scheduling two
of you at that time, the other person will be inconvenienced if you don't show up or don't come on
time. If you find you can't make it, please call me at
[number]. Remember, you are making a commitment
to your partner to come and come on time.
Upon arrival, each subject was seated in a soundproof
cubicle equipped with a desk and two chairs and asked
to read the instructions. High-trust condition subjects
were told the partner had arrived and was seated in the
adjoining cubicle and that the experiment could begin
shortly. Low-trust condition subjects were told that the
partner had riot yet arrived and that the experiment
would begin as soon as he or she did so.
Printed instructions introduced a study of interpersonal coordination under various conditions of com-

I just discovered that I don't have all of the materials
that we need for the experiment. Evidently, the secretary didn't make as many copies as I asked for. I'll
have to go make more copies before we can start. We
can begin as soon as I get back.

We can't begin yet because your partner still isn't here.
By the way, this same guy [girl] signed up last week
and didn't show up at all, but he [she] promised to
be here this time. If it's okay with you, let's wait a few
more minutes.
After 5 min., the experimenter returned to ask if the
subject would mind waiting a few more minutes, adding
that unless the other arrived shortly there would not be
enough time to run the experiment anyway. After 5
more min., the experimenter returned to announce that
the partner had finally arrived and the experiment could
begin. Thus, in both conditions subjects waited an unexpected 10 min. for the experiment to begin, but only
those in the low-trust condition could attribute their inconvenience to the partner. As in the high-trust condition, subjects were given the coordination problems and
told they had 10 min. to answer them. The remainder
of the session was identical for all subjects.
After collecting subjects' answers, the experimenter
returned with a feedback sheet informing them that they
had coordinated on four of the eight problems. Successful coordination was indicated on those four problems for which, in fact, the subject had given the most
common response, according to Schelling's (1960) data.
Subjects were asked to study the feedback sheet and then
to complete the SITS. The SITS instructions asked subjects to form "as accurate an impression as possible" of
the partner and to respond to each item of the scale with
the partner in mind.
After collecting the SITS, subjects were informed that
there would be no second part of the experiment. A
manipulation check questionnaire was administered.
Finally, subjects were debriefed and probed about their
suspicions during the experiment and about their
impressions of the partner.

inconvenienced waiting for the experiment
to begin and (b) they saw their partner as
responsible for this inconvenience. There
were no differences between trust conditions
on the first item, F(\, 36) = 1.22. However,
subjects in the low-trust condition were
much more likely to perceive their partners
as responsible for the inconvenience they did
experience than were subjects in the hightrust condition (Ms = 36.4 and 8.8, respectively), F(l, 36) = 54.0, p < .001. These data
suggest that the reliableness manipulation
was successful.
The SITS data were analyzed in the following manner: Since the composition of the
trust subscales was different for males and
females, their data were analyzed separately.

In addition, sex of subject was included in
the analysis of those items that were common
to the subscales of both sexes. Since subscales
varied in number of items, the unit of analysis was the mean score per item on each
subscale. Thus, a subject's score on any subscale could theoretically vary from 1 (low
trust) to 9 (high trust).
For male subjects, a 2 X 3 (Trust X Subscale) analysis of variance with repeated measures on the second factor revealed, as predicted, a main effect for trust, F( 1,18) = 17.8,
p < .001, with high-trust subjects expressing
more trust in partners (M = 6.10) than subjects in the low-trust condition (M - 4.57).
The subscale factor did not reach significance, F(2, 36) = 1.99. However, the Trust X
Subscale interaction did reach significance,
F(2, 36) = 8.86, p < .01. Inspection of the
means in Table 2 indicates that the Reliableness subscale was particularly sensitive
to the manipulation of trust, whereas the
Emotional Trust subscale was relatively unaffected. Not surprisingly, means on the
Overall Trust subscale were more consistent
with those on the Reliableness subscale, as
would be expected if it truly measures overall, generalized trust. The Emotional Trust
subscale results suggest that subjects were
unwilling to use the information provided by
the trust manipulation to generalize about
another's trustworthiness in qualitatively different situations. These results provide rather
strong support for the discriminant validity
of the subscales.
A parallel analysis of variance was conducted for females' responses. As Table 2
reveals, means for the two trust conditions
were only trivially different (Ms = 6.06 for
high-trust and 6.10 for low-trust subjects).
There was a significant subscale main effect,
with subjects in both conditions expressing
more trust in partners on the Reliableness
subscale (M = 6.35) than on the Emotional
Trust Subscale (M = 5.81), F(l, 18) = 8.61,
p < .01. There was also a significant Trust X
Subscale interaction, F(l, 18) = 4.52, p <
.05. Compared with low-trust subjects, hightrust subjects were more trusting of their
partners on the Reliableness subscale and less
trusting on the Emotional Trust scale. These
results are clearly more ambiguous than
those for males, although it is encouraging

<-----Page 7----->INTERPERSONAL TRUST

that subjects responded appropriately to the
Reliableness scale.
An analysis of responses to items common
to male and female subscales was conducted
to partially explicate the preceding sex differences. Mean scores on common items of
the Reliableness subscale and the Emotional
Trust subscale were analyzed in a 2 X 2 X 2
(Trust Condition X Sex X Subscale) analysis
of variance, with repeated measures on the
third factor. The effect for trust condition was
significant, F(l, 36) = 4.78, p < .05, with
means in the expected direction (see Table
2). Overall, females were more trusting than
males, F(l, 36) = 6.06, p < .05. Subscale was
also significant, F(l, 36) = 9.70, /?<.001,
with subjects rating partners as more trustworthy on the Reliableness subscale than on
the Emotional Trust subscale. The Trust X
Subscale interaction was highly significant,
F(l, 36) = 12,43, p < .001, indicating that
the Reliableness subscale was more affected
by the trust manipulation than was the
Emotional Trust subscale. Again, this finding
is important in establishing discriminant validity. As Table 2 indicates, the Emotional
Trust subscale was insensitive to the manipulation (Ms = 5.28 for high-trust and 5.20
for low-trust subjects), whereas the three
common Reliableness subscale items discriminated the high-trust from the low-trust
subjects (Ms = 6.36 and 5.13, respectively).
Experiment 2: Emotional Trust
In this experiment, subjects' impressions
of another as trustworthy in a personal,
emotional sense were manipulated. Subjects
were exposed to another who either fulfilled
or did not fulfill a promise to keep confidential the personal information disclosed1 to
him or her. Hypotheses parallel those made
for Experiment 1. First, a person portrayed
as emotionally trustworthy was expected to
receive higher ratings of trust on all subscales.
Second, it was expected that subjects would
make more disparate ratings of trustworthy
and untrustworthy others on the Emotional
Trust subscale than on the other subscales.
Method
Subjects. Eighty-four students enrolled in personality
and developmental psychology classes at Tufts Univer-

1313

sity completed the experimental questionnaire. Fifteen
males and 27 females were run in each of the two trust
conditions.
Design and overview. Each subject received one form
of an alleged interview transcript involving a therapist,
a client, and the therapist's supervisor, all the same sex
as the subject. In the course of the interview, the therapist
either betrayed a confidence of the client's to the supervisor or did not betray a confidence. After reading
the transcript, subjects completed the SITS.
Interview transcript. The seven-page handout included the following sections:
1. Introduction. The dialogues were described as actual interviews conducted at the counseling center of a
nearby university. The participants were identified as a
therapist, described as a 21-year-old senior undergraduate majoring in mental health studies; a client, an undergraduate who had contacted the center for help with
certain personal problems; and a supervisor, a PhD psychologist who supervised the clinical work of the therapist. Subjects were told that they would be reading transcripts of two conversations, one a clinical interview
between client and therapist and the other a training
interview between therapist and supervisor. Subjects
were urged to try to form "as accurate an impression as
possible of the therapist as a person."
2. Client interview. The conversation between therapist and client focused on the client's description of
personal difficulties and the reasons for contacting the
counseling center. The dialogue was written to approximate a Rogerian-style interview, thus portraying the
therapist in a neutral, noncommittal fashion throughout.
The high-trust and low-trust forms of the questionnaire
differed only in two sentences spoken by the therapist
near the end of the conversation. In response to the
client's obvious hesitancy about sharing information of
a personal nature, the therapist in the high-trust condition said:
But things we talk about here will be completely confidential, completely between you and me and the
person who supervises my work here. I share all my
interviews with my supervisor in weekly meetings,
since I'm still in training. Other than that, though, I'm
not going to discuss this with anyone, and of course
you would have to give permission before anyone else
could use the tape for research purposes or anything
like that.
In the low-trust condition, the therapist merely stated:
But things we talk about here will be completely confidential, completely between you and me. I'm not
even going to discuss this with anyone, and of course
you would have to give permission before anyone else
could use the tapes for research purposes or anything
like that.
3. Training interview. This interview between therapist and supervisor was portrayed as having taken place
several days after the initial interview with the client.
The training interview was identical for all subjects, except for appropriate gender references. During the interview the therapist revealed most of the personal information discussed by the client. The therapist did not
indicate that there had been a discussion of the confi-

<-----Page 8----->1314

dentiality of the interview or caution the supervisor of
the client's concern that the personal nature of the interview might be revealed to someone else. The training
interview therefore represented a violation of the client's
trust in the low-trust condition but not in the high-trust
condition, where disclosure to the therapist was explicitly mentioned.
The SITS was presented on a separate page following
the training interview. Subjects were instructed to imagine themselves "in a position of someone who shares a
relationship with the therapist, someone who is a friend
of hers [his]" and then to complete the scale. Since the
scale was constructed on the basis of trust ratings of
same-age peers, the therapist was portrayed as an undergraduate and presumably of relatively equal status.
Procedure. The transcripts and questionnaires were
distributed during class time. The experimenter asked
that they be completed anonymously. Subjects were debriefed in class and were assured that undergraduate students would not, in all likelihood, conduct such interviews at a university counseling center.

Results
As in Experiment 1, the SITS data were
first analyzed independently for males and

females. A subsequent analysis was carried
out for items common to the subscales for
both sexes, including sex as a factor. Again,
the unit of analysis was the mean score (1.09.0) per item ori each subscale.
For male subjects, a 2 X 3 (Trust X Subscale) analysis of variance with repeated measures on the subscale factor revealed that
high-trust subjects expressed more trust in
their partners (Af = 6.17 vs. 5.57), F(l, 28) =
3.25, p<.10. All subjects expressed most
trust on the Reliableness subscale (M = 6.30)
and least on the Emotional Trust subscale
(M = 5.47), F(l, 28) = 11.35,;? < .001. The
Trust X Subscale interaction was not significant, F(2, 56) = 1.83, p < .25, but means
were in the predicted direction, suggesting
that the Emotional Trust subscale was most
sensitive to the manipulation of trust and
reaffirming the discriminant validity of the
subscales (see Table 3).
A 2 X 2 (Trust X Subscale) analysis of
variance for female respondents revealed a
highly significant main effect for trust, F(l,
52) = 12.78, p < .001, with high-trust subjects scoring the highest on both subscales.
Again, there was a significant subscale main
effect, with higher ratings on the Reliableness
subscale, F(l, 52) = 4.97, p < .01. The significant Trust X Subscale interaction, F(1,
52) = 5.3, p < .05, reveals, as hypothesized,
the differential sensitivity of subscales to the
trust manipulation (see Table 3).
Analysis of combined male and female
responses on common items (Trust X Sex X
Subscale) revealed no significant effect for sex
of subject, nor any significant interactions
involving sex. As in the preceding analyses,
however, there was a significant effect for
trust, F(l, 80) = 8.62, p < .01; scale, F(l,
80) = 32.63, p < .001; and Trust X Subscale,
F(l, 80) = 6.08, p< .05.
In general, results of Experiment 2 confirmed all hypotheses. Compared to subjects
in the low-trust condition, subjects assigned
to the high-trust condition rated the therapist
as more trustworthy, particularly on the
Emotional Trust subscale.
General Discussion
The development of a psychological construct that is meaningful and measurable by

<-----Page 9----->INTERPERSONAL TRUST

a given instrument requires evidence of construct uniqueness and discriminability
(Campbell & Fiske, 1959). Discriminant validity of specific interpersonal trust was established in two ways. First, factor analyses
of subjects' responses to items of the Rubin
(1970) Loving and Liking Scales and items
of the SITS provide evidence that trust can
be measured separately from other positive
interpersonal attitudes. Trust items clustered
in interpretable groups that did not include
items previously demonstrated to tap liking
and love. Of course, real-life experiences of
trust are undoubtedly associated with such
feelings as love, liking, respect, and mutuality. However, specific interpersonal trust is
psychologically meaningful and nonredundant.
Second, evidence for discriminant validity
of individual subscales of the SITS comes
from two experiments. It was predicted in
both that subjects confronting someone who
was portrayed as trustworthy in some particular sense would make trusting ratings on the
SITS compared with subjects faced with an
untrustworthy other. This hypothesis received support in both experiments. More
relevant to the issue of discriminant validity,
however, are the Trust X Subscale interaction effects, which were predicted and obtained. In Experiment 1, subjects confronted
a partner who was specifically requested to
be punctual so as not to inconvenience the
subject, and this partner seemingly either did
or did not comply. As expected, for both
males and females, trust ratings on the Reliableness subscale were differentially influenced by this manipulation to a greater extent than were the other subscales. The only
jarring note in the otherwise consistent pattern of supportive results was the tendency
of low-trust females to rate their unreliable
partners as more emotionally trustworthy.
We offer no interpretation for this anomaly.
In general, however, impressions of another's
reliableness did not extend to the areas of
emotional trust or overall trust, thus affirming the uniqueness of the dimension tapped
by the Reliableness subscale.
In Experiment 2, subjects were asked to
rate another's trustworthy or untrustworthy
behavior in an emotionally laden, interpersonal situation. Although all subscales were

1315

somewhat sensitive to this manipulation,
trust ratings on the Emotional Trust subscale
demonstrated the most pronounced effect for
all subjects. The fact that one was deemed
untrustworthy with personal confidences did
not contaminate the impression of reliableness. Emotional trustworthiness was thereby
affirmed as unique and independent.
The moderate responsivity of the Overall
Trust subscale shows that it measures general, nondiscriminant trust in another. Its
sensitivity to condition differences in Experiment 1 suggests that it may tap a dimension
of trust more similar to reliableness than
emotional trust. Possibly this particular measure would be useful in situations where the
exact kind of trust under consideration is
unknown.
Sex Differences and Trust
There is substantial evidence from this investigation that males and females think
about trust quite differently. Sex differences
in construct definition, with females utilizing
more differentiated dimensions, emerged in
the factor analyses. Further, the particular
content of these factors was sufficiently different for the two sexes to make separate
scales a necessity. Finally, results of Experiment 1 revealed females consistently making
more trusting ratings of partners, even on
items common to the two scales. Examination of some comments made by female subjects during the postexperimental interview
might illuminate this finding. Several lowtrust females spontaneously reported that
they avoided making a hasty judgment,
wanted to give the other a second chance, or
otherwise expressed unwillingness to make
a low rating despite a recognition that it was
deserved. Since these same women did not
report feeling less inconvenienced by the tardiness or less certain that tardiness signaled
unreliability, this finding suggests that women
may be more hesitant to label another as
untrustworthy on limited information, instead moving slowly and collecting additional data before solidifying such an opinion. Evidence that females score higher on
measures of generalized trust in others has
been obtained by others (Chun & Campbell,
1974; Rosenberg, 1957; Wrightsman, 1964).

<-----Page 10----->1316

Reliableness and Emotional Trust
One consistent yet unexpected finding was
the tendency for subjects to rate stimulus
persons as significantly more reliable then
emotionally trustworthy. Ratings made by
female subjects in Experiment 1 and by subjects of both sexes in Experiment 2 conformed to this pattern. It seems unlikely that
the higher Reliableness ratings are simply the
product of an item difficulty artifact; subjects
in the original sample did not display such
a tendency toward higher ratings on the Reliableness items; if anything, they were lower
(see Table 1). Rather, the effect is most likely
due to implicit characteristics of the dimensions themselves, as they interact with the
level of intimacy of the relationship. Reliableness is a quality that seems more superficial and less special than emotional trustworthiness. Behaving in a reliable manner is
a norm of everyday social interaction and
perhaps can be assumed to exist in the absence of contrary information. Subjects in
the experiments could readily attribute reliableness to another, since they were in the
early stages of trust formation. However, unlike subjects in the original sample, who were
responding to intimate friends, experimental
subjects could not so easily assume that the
other would be emotionally trustworthy.
Usefulness of the SITS and Future
Directions
Interpersonal trust has been shown to involve various components that can be measured independently and fluctuate as a function of the precise nature and meaning of the
target person's behavior. These results suggest a number of useful applications of the
SITS in experimental and clinical research.
Trust toward a specific individual might mediate certain frequently investigated behaviors, such as self-disclosure and cooperativeness. In clinical settings, the SITS could be
used to determine levels of trust in people
who are typically viewed as trustworthy (e.g.,
parents, spouse) or who ought to be viewed
as trustworthy (e.g., the therapist). Scores
that diverge substantially from those of the
normative sample might suggest efforts on
the part of the therapist and client to discover

reasons for the mistrust and to work toward
a more trusting relationship. Similar assessments of specific interpersonal trust would
have value in group work where mistrust
among group members could inhibit the
communication of feelings and information.
Despite the encouraging results, considerable research remains if we are to develop
a thorough understanding of interpersonal
trust and its measurement. One vital next
step is to collect information bearing on the
ecological validity of the subscales. Will a
trusting score on the Reliableness subscale,
for instance, predict trusting behavior toward
the target in real-life situations? Future investigations also might focus on dimensions
other than those presently represented in the
SITS, providing evidence for the validity of
subscales measuring dependability or physical trust. Ultimately, it is hoped that refinement of such an instrument as the SITS will
provide a means for studying the development of trust over time. The process of trusting another, if it is to be truly understood,
must be investigated in the context of an
evolving, shared association between individuals.
