Letter from the Editor:

Best Global Practices in Internal Organization
Development
by Thiet (Ted) K. Nguyen, Johnson & Johnson

I recently returned from a business trip to the Asia Pacific Region where I visited Japan, China, India, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Several weeks prior to this trip, I was in Europe visiting Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the UK
supporting the Emea region talent management team with strategic projects. During my global business travels in the
last several years, whether to emerging markets like Russia, Turkey, China, India and Vietnam or to established markets
like the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Japan, I have come to appreciate the value our profession brings to drive change
while enhancing organizational growth and vitality.
From my perspective, I believe our profession is becoming localized in this global market place. Today, Western consultants are traveling to the East. Tomorrow, we may see Eastern consultants traveling West as the need for Western consultants traveling East diminishes. Today, we may export knowledge and talent from developed markets to help grow
developing markets. Tomorrow, we may import talents from the emerging markets to help turnaround established
markets. The global marketplace is changing rapidly, and I believe we need to continually upgrade our skills and reinvent our knowledge to remain vital as a profession.
By publishing this global Special Edition, we expect to achieve our goal to help drive change and grow our profession.
This Special Edition will benefit the HR/OD community in several ways:
•	 Academic community – The academic community will find the content of these contributions of value to raise the
awareness of current best internal practices. Program directors can be informed and encouraged to strengthen their
curriculums and research directions. Graduate students may use this edition to leverage their classroom experience,
as they prepare to enter the OD profession and compete for opportunities in the global marketplace.
•	 Current practitioners – Both internal and external practitioners can use this knowledge to guide and grow their practice areas, enhance their skills, and strengthen their core competencies, by learning from other OD professionals.
•	 Our clients and business partners – Potential and existing clients can be better informed of the capabilities OD
professional can bring to enhance employee engagement and organizational growth and vitality.
Since the May 2007 publication of the first of a three-volume set of the global Special Edition, we have received a
number of congratulatory phone calls and emails from academics and practitioners. We have also received requests for
copies from colleagues worldwide. Given the overwhelming interest level to the premier global Special Edition, our
printer agreed to a second printing within two weeks of the initial publication. We appreciate your warm thoughts
and forgiveness of any errors or omissions you may have found while reading the last edition.
Content like this has never been captured or disseminated because internal practitioners tend not to have the luxury of
time to write. This is the first time many of these authors took the time to document their work, secure the support of

J o u r n a l

their company to release the information, and share their internal efforts with all who are interested. We applaud all
our authors for their trust in us, and their willingness to provide working papers without the benefit of professional
editors. What readers will experience in this global Special Edition is truly the authentic voices of internal practitioners
worldwide who share their stories from a place of caring and eagerness to advance the field of organization
development.
While this series is titled a best internal OD practice edition, no one associated with its production has judged or evaluated “a best global practice”. Rather, authors were encouraged to share what they perceived to be a best practice within their organization, whether that organization is a start-up company in India, a non-profit organization in the USA,
an energy company in Africa, or a hi-tech company in China. We also chose not to judge whether an article fits the
definition of organization development, since there are variations among the definitions of OD We recognized, too,
that OD is practiced differently across geographies, countries, sectors, industries, organizations, groups and contexts.
To share additional insights into their workplaces, many authors have generously provided a one-page reflection outlining their working environment, the benefits of the intervention as described in their paper, and finally, to share their
take on the experience. In some articles, the reflection page includes one or two brief testimonials from their business
partners, internal clients, and/or others who were directly affected by the interventions.
This second global Special Edition is the collaborative labor of love of 20+ authors/co-authors and an all-volunteer
team of 105 practitioners worldwide who have invested thousands of hours during the last year to bring this publication from concept to reality. Together, we have become actively engaged because of our passion and commitment to
enhance the capabilities and reputation of our profession. Collectively, we share the common goal of advancing the
field of organization development by strengthening the internal body of practice literature.
We hope you will enjoy reading this global Special Edition. Look for the final volume in November 2007 when we
will bring you the remaining 25 articles. As always, we welcome your feedback to help us continually improve.

Thank you.

A Structured, Facilitated Team Approach
to Innovation
Drew Boyd, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., A Johnson & Johnson Company

Abstract
Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., division) has used a method of systematic inventive thinking
to create new organic growth opportunities and efficiencies. The outcomes of fifty facilitated team workshops
using this method reflect successful efforts to solve a
range of issues: creating new products, improving
products, developing new marketing strategies, building
brands, creating customer solutions, and improving organizational process. This paper reviews our experience
with this approach over a period of four years beginning
in July 2002.

Introduction
Innovation is a crucial source of both organic growth
opportunities and efficiencies for companies. It leads to
new products, effective strategies, improved processes,
and fresh organizational designs. However, innovation
is challenging partly because of behaviors and attitudes
toward innovation in relation to one’s status in the organization. A facilitated, systematic, team approach to innovation can overcome human behavior challenges and
make innovation more predictable.

Even if people knew how to systematically and routinely
innovate beyond brainstorming, there are other challenges. They may resist trying for fear of failure (Lee, Edmondson & Worline, 2004).  Status-conscious employees
often keep their good ideas to themselves, afraid to test
them in the workplace, fearing embarrassment and loss
of status if their ideas fail.
Another barrier is that even when people generate novel
ideas for the good of the organization, their colleagues
may see these ideas as tainted. Acknowledging a superior
idea from a colleague implies deference to their internal
rival and devalues their own status and distinctiveness
within the organization (Blau, 1955; Lee, 1997; Menon &
Pfeffer, 2003; Sutton & Hargadon, 1996).
Finally, employees may resist sharing their best ideas for
fear of colleagues stealing or “free-riding” on that idea
(Williams, Harkins & Lattane, 1981; Kerr & Bruun, 1983;
Harkins & Petty, 1982).  People may harbor ideas waiting
for the ideal time to reveal them in a way that limits their
colleagues from taking credit.
How do we overcome these conundrums? We believe
that a systematic technique to innovation conquers these
challenges and increases inventive group thinking across
a range of business issues and activities.

Why Innovation is Difficult in Organizations

Templates of Innovation

There are several well-researched reasons why innovation
may be stifled within an organization. Take brainstorming,
for example. Brainstorming may be the most overused and
underperforming tool in business. Introduced in the 1950s,
Osborne defined brainstorming as a group process to improve ideation. The premise was that to get good ideas,
one must get a lot of ideas (Osborne, 1957).  However
study after study has shown that groups generating ideas
using traditional brainstorming are no more effective than
individuals working alone (Isaksen, 1998; Paulus, Larey &
Ortega, 1995; Mullen & Salas, 1991).

A method used by Johnson & Johnson is called systematic inventive thinking (Goldenberg, Horowitz, Levav
& Mazursky, 2003; Goldenberg & Mazursky, 2002).
Systematic inventive thinking is a set of tools used in a
facilitated team environment to generate predictable,
progressive ideas. This innovation process uses templates
to help regulate individual thinking and channel the
ideation process in a structured way that overcomes the
randomness of brainstorming.
The five templates of innovation include: Subtraction,
Task Unification, Multiplication, Attribute Dependency,
Volume 25 • Number 3 • FALL 2007 | p119

<-----Page 8----->and Division. They were developed by recognizing the
same consistent pattern over many products so that the
pattern could be applied in a way to create new innovative products. The templates are recognizable and identifiable for almost any type of product. The method grew
out of research by the Russian engineer Genrich Altshuller who spent his professional life working to formalize the creative process (Goldenberg et al., 2003).
Briefly, the method works by taking a product, concept,
situation, service, process, or other seed construct, and
breaking it into its component parts or attributes. The
templates manipulate the components or variables to
create new-to-the-world constructs that the innovator
must then find a valuable use (Finke, Ward & Smith,
1992).  This notion of taking the solution and finding a
problem that it can solve is called “Function Follows
Form,” and it is at the heart of the systematic inventive
thinking method.
One example of a template is Subtraction. The pattern
of innovation for Subtraction is that something has been
removed from a product or service so as to create a new
function or benefit for that product or service. Consider
a pattern in these four items: contact lenses, an exercise
bicycle, powdered soup, and an automatic teller machine
(ATM).  The contact lens has had the frame of a regular

pair of glasses removed. The exercise bicycle has had the
rear wheel removed. A package of powdered soup has
had the water removed. And the ATM has had the bank
employee removed. In each case, taking something away
created a new innovative use or benefit.

Team Innovation
At Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.,
division), we have used all of the templates in facilitated
team workshops to create new organic growth opportunities and efficiencies. Workshops range from four hours
to five days in length. Typically teams have twelve to
fifteen members with diverse backgrounds: by business
function, by market/geography, and by gender. The actual makeup of the team depends on the business focus
and the purpose of innovating, such as growth, competitiveness, efficiency, organizational design, etc. A sampling of workshop participants innovating new products
may include the following: three or four marketers from
different global regions; three engineers representing
different areas, such as design, mechanical, and manufacturing; three clinicians, such as a nurse, surgeon and
doctor of veterinary medicine; an industrial designer; a
field sales representative; a customer call center representative; a customer; and possibly external partners,
such as an advertising agency or consultant.

Systematic Inventive Thinking Tool

Outcome Ideas

Subtraction

•	 Virtual tours of a marquee training facility that allow customers to
experience it without having to travel
•	 A medical device that uses suction to hold tissue to the device so that it
can function without having to pierce the tissue first

Task Unification

•	 Operating room equipment that uses backup power from other
equipment
•	 A medical device that injects cool air to the tissue to reduce blood loss
•	 An alliance of medical/hospital supply companies that can offer a wider,
more competitive product offering

Multiplication

•	 Needle that dissolves in the body harmlessly and painlessly after use
•	 For training, offer three levels of testing – easy, medium, and hard – and
allow trainees to select the level they wish to take; provide higher level
incentives based on achievement

Attribute Dependency

•	 A medical device that adapts to the tissue type it touches
•	 A surgical device that curves once inside the body due to increase in
temperature, making it more maneuverable
•	 A surgical procedure that can be adjusted later in life as the body changes
•	 A product branding system that changes or disappears if product
tampering occurs

Division

•	 A complex operating room machine broken into smaller modular components that can be moved from OR to OR and that can communicate
with each other

<-----Page 9----->Outcomes of Systematic Inventive Thinking
Systematic inventive thinking is counterintuitive,
elegant, and highly productive based on our experience.
Table 1 illustrates some of our results:

Why Templates Work
To overcome the four challenges of: (1) how to innovate,
(2) fear of failure, (3) withholding  ideas, and (4) rejecting
ideas from colleagues, team innovation workshops are
facilitated by an external consultant specializing in the
training and use of these templates (Goldenberg et al.,
2003).  The workshops are tightly structured to address
the challenges of human behavior and attitudes towards
innovation and their personal organizational status.
Participants are led through a series of exercises using
everyday, common products to demonstrate that people
can systematically innovate on command. Participants
learn how each template is applied to a problem, product, or situation to give many different original ideas in
that space. The templates, by their nature, specify a rigorous course of thinking that participants are expected to
follow exactly. While the templates are not particularly
difficult to learn, the training is demanding so that teams
can execute each pattern in a routine way. At the end of
the training, people no longer have the excuse that they
do not know how to innovate.
In the group workshop setting, people trade in their fear
of failure at innovating for a fear of not innovating. Skillful facilitation lets each person have the spotlight at regular intervals so that the pressure to perform and please
the group is strong but not overbearing. The facilitation
creates a level innovating field so that all participants
have the same resources, tools, insights, and opportunities to contribute novel ideas. While it may be true that
some participants are judgmental of ideas and the people
who generated them, this dynamic does not seem strong
enough to overcome the productive nature of the templates when properly facilitated. The templates make
people innovate in a structured way regardless of their
fear of peer judgment.
The facilitated approach uses techniques that would
seem to stifle innovation when in fact they accelerate
innovation. One such technique is the Principle of
Constraints (Goldenberg et al, 2003) as a way to overcome the tendency of people to filter their ideas or other
self-serving behavior as they are generating ideas.
Participants work in small teams, often in pairs, where
they are given specific assignments to generate new
ideas in a matter of a few minutes. Each partner has
to participate in the assignment which creates a strong
collegial pressure to perform.
With these constraints, it appears that people place a
premium on getting the idea out of their head and over

to their partner first rather than pre-judge the merits of
the idea and the value to their personal status for having
thought of it. Working in pairs seems to create a sense of
accountability and transparency. Once the idea is out on
the table, each partner gives some sense of oversight or
verification that the idea has been shared with the larger
group. A participant may think afterward that one of his
or her ideas is brilliant and thus too good to share with
the group, but it is too late. The idea has been captured
for the larger group to consider.
The systematic inventive thinking method produces
several dozens to several hundreds of ideas depending
on the amount of time dedicated to the activity. Skillful
facilitation is required again to help overcome the problem of peer acceptance of those ideas.
First, the facilitators create an environment of non-attribution so that no one individual is associated with a
specific idea. Because the idea was generated in a small
team of two or three, and because the moment of truth
was born out of a stepwise contribution of their insights
and notions during the mini-exercises, it is often hard
to distinguish who actually could be credited with generating one specific idea. Idea anonymity reduces the internal competitive threat among colleagues and makes
ideas no longer tainted. Participants come to recognize
idea contribution as process output.
Second, the facilitation process emphasizes only newlycreated ideas rather than ideas participants had before
coming to the workshop. This inhibits the problem of
people selling their pet ideas to their peers, which are
usually ideas that the peers have already rejected.
Third, the facilitators lead the larger team to develop a
specific set of objective, weighted criteria to judge each
of the new ideas generated in the workshop. Diverse
groups bring the value of diverse thinking but also the
added cost of having to converge on a set of guiding
principles.
With these criteria in place in the form of a linear
weighted model, ideas are allowed to rise to the top
without the stigma of who generated them or who
judged them. Internal competition among peer rivals is
minimized allowing for a more objective evaluation of
ideas. Thoughtful facilitation seems to bring about this
alignment much more efficiently than what internal
groups can do left on their own.

Conclusion
Team Innovation is working successfully at Johnson &
Johnson (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., division).  The
facilitated, systematic team approach to using templates
helps people (1) innovate on command, (2) overcome
their fear of innovation failure, (3) share their ideas with
a diverse group of colleagues, and (4) be more accepting

With a systematic approach to innovation, my greatest
challenge was convincing people that innovation could
be trained and routinized. A second challenge was to get
people to realize innovation is not limited to the engineering team. Each individual has a need to generate
new ideas continuously.
To overcome these challenges, I proposed a pilot innovation session and sought support from more than one
senior-level sponsor. Multiple sponsors spread the financial risk associated with the pilot so that no one sponsor
would bear the full loss if it failed. If the pilot was
successful, the approach would gain more acceptance
and alignment.
The pilot was a success. It gave me the reference point
needed to spread systematic innovation to other parts of
the organization. Word of mouth and personal selling
made people realize that they needed to try the innovation method or risk falling behind other franchises.
In a culture dominated by portfolio thinking, teams
compete for investment resources not just on the merits
of their current business prospects but also on future
prospects. This approach shows teams that systematic
innovation enables them to create an exciting pipeline
of new product ideas and therefore to compete more
effectively for internal resources.
