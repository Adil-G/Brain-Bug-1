While there is litde dispute over the i m p o r t a n c e of trust i n a marriage - - o r a n y
p e r s o n a l relationship, for that m a t t e r q the role of trust in b u s i n e s s relationships evokes controversy. T h e c o n t r o v e r s y ranges from "it is u n d e r s t o o d o n all
sides that the t r u t h is n o t e x p e c t e d to b e s p o k e n " (Carr, 1968) to "the e c o n o m i c

a m o n g business executives" ~ l o d g e t t , 1968). More c o n t e m p o r a r y e x a m p l e s o f
the controversy include: "Treachery, w e fotmd, c a n pay. T h e r e is n o c o m p e l l i n g

Deutsch (1958: 266) defines trust as follows:
An individual may be said to have trust in the occtu'rence of an event
if he expects its occurrence and his expectations lead to behavior
which he perceives to have greater negative consequences if the
expectation is n o t confirmed than positive motivational consequences if it is confirmed.

A r r o w (1973: 24) asserts,
...ethical elements enter in some measure into every contract; without them, no market could function. There is an element of trust in
every transaction; typically, one object of value changes hands before
the other one does, and there is confidence that the countervalue
will in fact be given up. It is not adequate to argue that there are
enforcement mechanisms, such as police and the courts; these are
themselves services bought and sold, and it has to be asked why they
will in fact do what they have contracted to do.
However, trust is n o t just a n e c e s s a r y evil. By discussing t h e s e t h r e e b a s e s

<-----Page 2----->eruptive nuclear strike as long as the o t h e r side had the capacity for total
destruction of the attacking country. The situation, MAD, was a deterrent that
permitted some level of trust to exist between two otherwise hostile countries.
Can deterrence-based trust be managed or created? We p r o p o s e three
forms of interactions as vehicles for creating deterrents to untrustworthy behavior: repeated interactions, multiple interactions, and interactions involving
hostage taking.

R e p e a t e d Interactions
One approach to deterring untrustworthy behavior is to have repeated interactions, in which each single transaction entails a small set of the possible forms of
benefit each party may create for the other. A partner is much less likely to act
distrustfully in one transaction ff future transactions, from which benefit may be
derived, are likely to be jeopardized. Optimally, the degree of risk incurred by
each side grows over time to match the perceived benefit of continued connection. Thus, a business relationship evolves slowly from one that looks very transactional to one that involves a great deal of potential loss by both sides, should
one decide to harm the other. The level of exposure each is willing to incur is
proportional to the level of loss connected with discontinuing the relationship
or potential retribution available to the injured party.
~lqais form of emergent trust is observed today in the changing relationship
between automobile manufacturers and suppliers. Historically, General Motors
would employ many suppliers and play one off against the other to create the
best advantage in each deal. Consequently, very little trust existed between supplier and manufacturer. With an increased concern for quality, longer term relations between General Motors and suppliers are evolving. Quality can best be
achieved w h e n both supplier and manufacturer come to k n o w each other well
enough to codesign parts and codevelop manufacturing processes. Such sharing
of knowledge and development of trust evolves through repeated interactions
between supplier and manufacturer. The long shadow of the future serves to
induce trustworthy behavior today (Axelrod, 1983).

Multiple Interactions o r Multifaceted Relationships
Deterrence-based trust can be built on having many points of contact at the
same time, as contrasted with repeated interactions over time. A partner is m u c h
less likely to act distrustfully in one transaction if concurrent transactions are
likely to be jeopardized. Thus, a supplier w h o is producing many parts for a firm
is less likely to behave self-interestedly in the production of one part than is a
supplier producing only a single part. qlae tendency to behave in a trustworthy
manner is especially true ff the production represents a large portion of a supplier's output. Similarly; functions within the same firm having many points of
contact, or organizational m e m b e r s interacting on many projects at the same
time, tend to be able to trust each other more than those engaged only in a single task together. The trust that results from multiplicity of transactions is one
reason w h y firms such as Xerox and IBM are attempting to reduce the n u m b e r
of vendors. Each vendor has more invested with each customer; hence, each has
more to lose by harming the customer, and therefore, more incentive to be
reliable.
Of course, costs are attached to trust based on repeated or multiple interactions. Most notably, a firm limits its options. The benefits of increased reliability
Negotiation Journal

<-----Page 3----->and reduced need for monitoring that accrue from this form of deterrence need
to be weighed, for example, against the reduction in flexibility in vendor selection. This "cost" of limiting vendor selection may be less in practice than it
appears in theory, however. While the ability to select on price may be reduced,
a vendor with many points of contact may be motivated to perform in a superior
fashion, resulting in increased quality. This benefit is manifested in the academic
world w h e n smart, "highly reputed" visiting professors do not teach as well as
"less well-reputed" full-time faculty. The long-term relationship of the h o m e faculty provides an incentive for high quality performance.

Reputation as Hostage
The third type of interaction that leads to deterrence-based trust is based on the
long-standing practice of hostage taking. In the Middle Ages, one lord w o u l d
keep the other lord's only son or daughter as an assurance that the other could
be trusted. The threat of loss of a precious child's life was generally sufficient to
ensure that the lord behaved appropriately. External factors to the relationship,
such as the courts or credit bureaus, represent a form of hostage taking today.
However, reputational hostage taking also exists as a feature of many business
relationships. Being located in a network of existing business clients serves such
a role. The threat of loss of reputation and resulting loss of business that comes
from having the word spread about untrustworthy business practice is generally
quite an effective deterrent. For this reason, gossip (or the fear of being its subjecO has been identified as a powerful means of social control (Almirol, 1981;
Bach, 1983). A repairman in a small town recognizes the importance of this sort
of trust. The repairman cannot afford to act in bad faith with one customer for
fear of the rest of the town knowing and potentially boycotting his service.

Summary
The three types of interactions we have just described are approaches to creating deterrence-based trust. But for deterrence-based trust to work, the following
conditions must exist:
•

the potential loss of future business mtLst outweigh the profit potential for
untrustworthy behavior;

-

each party must be sufficiently diligent to reveal to the other that it would
know that harm has been done; and

•

the potentially harmed party must be wiling to withdraw benefits from or
introduce harm to the party acting distrustfully.

The need to recognize harm, the second point above, illustrates h o w deterrencebased trust is an imperfect form. One benefit of deterrence is to minimize the
need for monitoring another's behavior, but some limited form of monitoring is
still necessary. It also illustrates a critical risk a manager or firm assumes w h e n
relying on deterrence. It is possible that a partner will underestimate your vigilance and attempt to take advantage of your not being able to detect self-interested behavior.
The last condition, willingness to introduce harm, represents one of the
reasons MAD was not a perfect source of nuclear deterrence. Both the Soviet
Union and the United States could reasonably question whether the other side
would make the very quick decision necessary to totally destroy the other coun368

A second basis of trust is predictability. Some suggest that trust occurs w h e n w e
predict, specifically, that a n o t h e r will behave cooperatively (Deutsch, 1958;
Pruitt, 1981: 102-131). Often, mutual trust results from this expectation, for it
produces a "self-fulfdling prophecy" effect. That is, people often act cooperatively toward those they expect to be cooperative, and this action encourages
the receivers of cooperative gestures to reciprocate in kind (Kelley and Stahelsld,
1970).
Even w h e n one expects tmcooperative behavior, however, w e argue that
trust can result ff the behavior is predictable. "lqlis is frequently the basis of trust
between siblings: We k n o w our brother or sister will attempt to behave distrustfully, but we also k n o w t h e m well enough to k n o w exactly how they will be
competitive. For example, if I k n o w an employee will always choose to maximize his/her salary at the expense of the firm, it is simply necessary to align the
employee's incentives with the interests of the firm. If another function in a firm
consistently acts in a manner that is inconsistent with your function's objective,
it is possible to manage or act on that consistency. For example, consider a discovery research group that finds that marketing analysis tends to undervalue the
profit potential of breakthrough discoveries. If the analysis is applied in consistent fashion, it is possible to provide information to the analyst in a form that
maximizes the likelihood of evaluating breakthrough positively. O f course, the
predictability of uncooperative behavior is not as desirable as reworking the
algorithm or better aligning the objectives of research and marketing. However,
a predictable partner, with motives not matching your own, is significantly- easier
to relate to than an tmpredictable one.
Describing predictably uncooperative behavior as a type of trust may s e e m
out of place if one views trust as accuracy" or truth or ff one attributes trust to an
individual rather than a situation. At its core, trust is simply dependability. The
benefits of dependability are reduced uncertainty and less need for contingent
planning. It frees u p t i m e for o t h e r activities and r e d u c e s a n x i e t y a b o u t
"unknowns." Assessing p r e d i c t a b l e b e h a v i o r as acceptable is n o t central to
achieving the benefits.

a p p r o a c h e s described above, r e p e a t e d and multifaceted relationships, contribute to tmderstanding and predictability: The more points of contact parties
have, the better the chances are that they will c o m e to understand and predict
each other's behavio~ Two other factors, however, are especially useful in establishing understanding and predictability: regular communication and courtship.

Regular Communication
Trust between spouses has a great deal to do with the fact that they m e e t frequently over dinner and breakfast, and thus, have m a n y opportunities for dialogue. Similarly, firms, functions, and individuals w h o have the opportunity for
ongoing communication improve trust. For example, a large steel manufacturer
had very p o o r relations b e t w e e n the manufacturing and sales personnel in their
Negotiation Journal

October 1992

369

<-----Page 5----->flat-rolled products division. On looking at the problellL it became clear that one
reason for the lack of trust between the two groups was that they did not understand each other well. Comaxmnication was difficult since the sales force was
located at corporate headquarters, while the operations were in field locations
several hundred miles away. Vastly improved relations, due to more frequent
commtmications, occurred w h e n the sales personnel were moved to the plant
site. A corollary result, however, is that both groups n o w distrust corporate staff
because each communicates with them less.
One historical reason for p o o r relations between unions and management
in labor relations is that communication occurred only once every few years,
namely, at the time of contract negotiations. In the interim, the parties d e p e n d e d
upon a contract and the intervention of an outsider (an arbitrator) to manage
their relations. The creation of standing joint management and labor committees
that communicate regularly usually improves the quality of relations b e t w e e n
management and union representatives (see Kochan, Katz, and McKersie, 1986,
for a review of changing trends in labor-management relations).

Courtship
A second vehicle for improving understanding and predictability b e t w e e n partners is to conduct very good research on the potential partner before a relationship is engaged. This research is directed at assessing the real compatibility, or
"interpersonal fit,' between partners, as well as assessing the degree to w h i c h a
potential partner engages in predictable behavior. American negotiators are frequently frustrated by the desire of Asian firms to conduct long, discovery-based
conversations before beginning to discuss the "business issues." This frustration
results from a clash between the American, w h o is thinking of deals as independent transactions, and the Asian partner, w h o is thinking of each deal as a buildhag block for a long-standing relationship. The Asian person thinks of business as
a marriage and, thus, is far more careful than the American, w h o considers business as a sequence of one-time dates (see Graham and Sano, 1989, for a contrast
of American versus Japanese negotiation behavior). These different perspectives
lead to different needs for information about the partner.
A recent conversation with a friend w h o bought a car illustrates the value
of careful courtship. She practiced weU all the traditional distributive negotiation
advice about buying a car. She sent for consumer reports data on cost, s h o p p e d
at many dealers, conducted several rounds of difficult negotiations, and bought
from the dealer offering the lowest price. She did not, however, seek any information about the reliability of the dealer and did not incorporate questions
about the dealer's quality into her considerations. Price was her single variable
of interest. Just before closing the deal, this friend realized she felt some reservations about the reliability of the dealer, but chose to ignore them. Instead of
investigating her hunch, she bought the car. A spoiler that was to be installed
only a few days later is still uninstalled two years later. Her disappointment with
the dealership is so great that she n o w takes her car elsewhere for service.
Closer attention to the relational, instead of merely the quantitative, aspects of
the negotiation may have enabled this c u s t o m e r to better predict the initial
dealer's unreliable service.

Deterrence

and Knowledge

Together

Additional benefits accrue w h e n deterrence and knowledge together exist as
bases of trust. Benefits range from the capacity to trust that the other party's
intentions are good to a view that the other side will not exploit information. In
other words, pairing d e t e r r e n c e and knowledge can eliminate the potential
harm of permitting your partner to gain knowledge about you w h e n no deterrent exists simultaneously. Sharing strategy w i t h e m p l o y e e s , f o r e x a m p l e ,
requires a belief that their intentions can be trusted. It requires assuming that
the employees will not share the strategy inappropriately or that they will not
utilize that knowledge to the d e t r i m e n t of the firm. A willingness to share
knowledge about yourself depends on the existence of a deterrent to the other
for taking advantage of that knowledge.
The coexistence of both types of trust allows parties to engage in full disclosure. A more complete sharing of information creates the potential for m o r e
effective problem solving. For example, if a supplier k n o w s a client's production
process, the supplier m a y b e able to suggest a design change in a p a r t to
improve qualityor cost. But, the client is unlikely to share information about the
production process ff the fear exists that the supplier will abuse the information.
A specific example of the benefits of this level of trust, and the costs of the
converse, exists in the automobile industry. A foundry, which supplies multiple
automobile manufacturers, has different relationships with two atttomoblle companies. Engineers from automobile firm A visit the foundry regularly. W h e n a
potential improvement is suggested by the foundry, it can usually be a p p r o v e d
w i t h a p h o n e call. Engineers f r o m a u t o m o b i l e firm B have not visited the
foundry's plant. Suggested inlprovements usually require multiple drawings,
with no guarantee of approval. The client operation officer of the foundry estimates that firm A has a 30 percent cost advantage for the same part, as well as
parts better suited to the firm's car design. Additionally, the officer is frustrated
with firm B, since the relationship severely limits his capacity to introduce quality improvement processes. As the example illustrates, the advantage of this level
of trust is that it allows parties to engage in full disclosure, receive m o r e complete information, reach a greater mutual understanding of the problem, and
consequently, make decisions more quickly. It is an excellent way to align interests, and it facilitates improved quality. Of course, the costs and the risks are also
the combination of those associated w i t h knowledge- and d e t e r r e n c e - b a s e d
trust. Time to research and monitor and a willingness to invoke a penalty are
necessary to sustain both forms of trust.
It is possible to fail in two ways, as well. Deterrence may be insufficient, or
your research and communication may be flawed. Although the costs and risks
seem doubled, this appearance is deceptive. These t w o forms of trust tend to
reinforce each other, but still require effort and vigilance.
Identification-Based

Trust

The highest order of trust assumes that one party has fully internalized the
other's preferences. This type of trust is identification. In social psychology, it
has been well demonstrated that people in the same group tend to behave in a
more trustworthy m a n n e r toward each other than t o w a r d others not in the
group (Deutsch, 1958; Dawes, Van de Kragt, and Orbell, 1988; K r a m e r and
Brewer, 1984). Membership in a firm has a similar effect. Often, the fact that
Negotiation Journal

October 1992

<-----Page 7----->someone is from the same company in some way makes him or her more trust-.
worthy. The issue of identification is a critical one in business. Consider, for
example, the consequences of firm identification. General Motors is a c o m p a n y
with well-delhaed boundaries, such that suppliers and distributors are not part of
the family. However, Toyota considers itself a whole chain of related businesses
and professional services competing with General Motors' entire chain. In the
first instance, potentially distrustful relations are established between the firm
and its critical suppliers and distributors. In the second, all c o m p o n e n t s are considered a part of one entity, in which eoproduction, codesign, communication,
and trust are paramount. Consider the following remarks of a senior Ford executive:
With all the attorneys and contracts in the world, our new product
plans are well known by our competitors, yet frequently we do not
know Toyota's plan until just before introduction.
Toyota's suppliers identify with their distributors, and thus, the t w o parties
make decisions that are in each other's interests. Under such circumstances, the
need for attorneys and contracts, designed to protect parties' interests, is less;
consequently, public knowledge of Toyota's interests is less.
The following conditions, in addition to the five previously mentioned, can
build trust based on identification.

Joint P r o d u c t s and Goals
Probably the best vehicle for increasing the level of perceived identification is
the creation of joint products or goals. For example, many organizations engage
in the quite irrational behavior of asking for improved relationships b e t w e e n
departmems, while providing the departments different and often c o m p e t i n g
goals. One version of joint products is the emerging tendency for customers to
be involved in the coproduction of a good. For example, a Swedish bearings
manufacturer is allowing customers access to their CAD-CAM system to custom
design products. Thus, Volvo may access the bearing manufacturer's design system to tailor design their o w n bearing. Similarly, accotmting firms, as a means o f
reducing the costs of an audit, are asking clients to perform more of the basic
work; automobile companies are experimenting with developing capacity for
customers to tailor design a car at a dealer; and universities are letting adult students design their own curriculum. In each instance, permitting the customer,
supplier, or other department into part of the production process increases the
level of joint identification, blurring the distinction b e t w e e n the parties and
increasing trust. In some instances, this may not be desirable - - as in an audit
when the auditor is supposed to be impartial - - but in general, increasing trust
in this way is a benefit.

Name
A name carries a great deal of meaning. For example, one vehicle through w h i c h
chemists and biologists began to converse more freely was with the emergence
of the field of biochemistry. The simple acknowledgment of their overlapping
interests helped to increase the rate of communication. Similarly, the creation of
business units typically serves to reduce the friction between functions within
that unit as they come to see themselves as having more in c o m m o n . While

372

Shapiro, Sheppard, a n d Cheraskin

Business on a Handshake

<-----Page 8----->seemingly trivial, the act of giving the same name to previously disparate pieces
creates a greater sense of identity. Dawes, Van de Kragt and Orbell (1988) argue
that shared identity through name is a sufficient condition to create cooperative
behavior. Many pharmaceutical firms have created research groups built around
therapeutic classes, such as cancer, virology, or cardiovascular diseases. Typically, scientists from diverse backgrotmds find it easier to communicate with this
shared name M and consequently, shared fate - - than ever before.

Proximity
We also tend to identify most with those p e o p l e to w h o m w e are closely
located. For example, people most frequently form friendships with those living
next door (Festinger, Schachter, and Back, 1950; N e w c o m b , 1961).Product
development teams located far from. each other have difficulty acting as teams.
Departments on separate floors do not identify well with each other. Executives
segregated on the top floor seem distant. Contiguity has the added advantage of
increasing the degree of communication between parties. Something as simple
as the strategic location of the coffee machine can vastly improve trust between
otherwise separate groups.

Shared Values
Of course, the perfect form of trust occurs w h e n we come to develop shared
values with our partner at the same time as a shared sense of interdependence.
When an individual comes to feel that his/her interest is best met by achieving
the partner's interest, trust follows. The creation of a shared strategy and shared
culture maximize the probability that this will happen in a business context.
The investment required to engender identification-based trust is greater
than that required for the establishment of deterrence-based trust, or trust based
on knowledge. The rewards, however, are commensurately greater. The benefits
go beyond quantity, efficiency; and flexibility that accrue from deterrence and
knowledge. When an identity relationship exists, one benefit is that it is possible
for your partner to act in your stead. "l]aus, just as knowledge and deterrencebased trust allow a person, group, or firm to b e c o m e more dependent u p o n
another person, group, or firm, identity-based trust makes it possible for a person, group, or fwm to permit a partner to act independently - - knowing your
interests will be met. Specifically, competent employees w h o k n o w and identify
with a firm can be given authority. Team members whose objectives and identity
are aligned with the team can be allowed to act on the team's behalf. In the
absence of entrusted delegation, inefficiencies can occur. For example, one company recently reorganized its systems groups into strategically targeted teams.
One such team found itself spending an inordinate amount of time having all
members participate in presentations to client groups and senior management.
After a two-day retreat to determine w h y no w o r k was getting done, they
decided that such en masse participation in presentations was a result of not
trusting that individual members truly identified with the teams and the other
members' interests.
A second benefit of identification-based trust is that it becomes more possible for a shared strategic focus and sustained consensus to evolve. A desire to
achieve each other's objectives is the starting point for the development of effective joint strategy and action.

exist. The partner acting as an agent may fred that the responsibility of acting in
someone else's behalf testa'lets Ms/her options. Specifically, the agent may Find it
necessary to make a decision counter to his/her o w n preference but aligned
with the preferences of the partner (Lewicki and Litterer, 1985).
The Handshake
Nervousness about relying on trust in business relationships stems fkom a concern that trust cannot be managed or relied upon. But the mutual trust-inducing
situations described earlier, such as courtship or joint production, are controllable. Creating multiple points of contact, conducting research on a future business partner, communicating frequently, creating shared goals, sharing names
and values are all activities partially within a manager's control. It behooves managers to consider the creation of trust in a business relationship as a strategic
decision in which the benefits accruing from trust are weighed against the costs
of creating and sustaining trust and the risks associated with trust. In Table 1, w e
have outlined the benefits, costs, and risks associated with each basis of trust discussed in this article.
Inspection of the table clearly illustrates that each basis of trust entails different advantages and dift~rent costs. Another important observation is that as
one moves from deterrence- to knowledge- to identification-based trust, the benefits grow, but so do the costs. Moreover, the three bases of trust are hierarchically ordered. That is, each previous basis of trust is a necessary condition for
the one that follows. Without some form of deterrence, few would trust another
enough to reveal critical information that serves as the basis for knowledge.
Without frequent and future interaction (a determinant of deterrence), the level
of communication necessary to develop intimate knowledge sufficient for prediction is not possible. Similarly, without knowledge of another's values and preferences, it is hard to come to identify with that other. Without knowledge o f
another's values and preferences, it is not possible to effectively act as the
other's agent. This hierarchical ordering is w h y b o t h the benefits and costs
increase as one moves from deterrence-based to knowledge-based to identification-based trust.
Creating

Conditions

for Trust

Given these different costs, risks, and advantages, h o w does one decide what to
do about trust? First, assess the type of relationship you want and the reqnisite
kind of trust necessary to sustain that relationship. As WJUiamson (1985) suggests, the need to invest in the establishment of trust is largely dependent u p o n
the complexity of the environment in which the relationship is e m b e d d e d and
the degree to which opportunistic behavior is possible. In complex environments permitting opportunistic behavior, it is not possible to depend u p o n or
even write a contract as an effective form of social control. The creation of bases
of trust is one alternative solution to complex environments in which it is possible to cheat. Other reasons for establishing trust also exist and are snggested in
Table 1, such as the importaxice of speed and quality. Given all possible reasons
for creating trust in a relationship, the task is to decide the requisite level of
trust. Is reliable performance to a contract all that is necessary? Is it also necessary to be able to incorporate the other party into responses to changes in the

<-----Page 11----->environment? Is the environment so complex and your relationship so interdependent that it is necessary to allow the other party to act on his or her own,
knowing that he or she will also incorporate your interest? Is there real value in
developing abilities in the other party to be able to provide unique services to
you or your firm?
Recognize that in choosing the level of trust one wishes, it is necessary to
also consider the costs and risks. Of course, w e would like the benefit of having
others represent our business interests without the need to monitor them, or
fear oppot~0anistic behavior on their part, but this comes at a high cost. Pick the
basis of trust that achieves your business needs with the least cost and lowest
risk. Over time, you may wish to increase the level of trust, but begin w h e r e it
makes most sense now. For example, in developing their alliance, Mazda and
Ford began with a concern only for reliability. They n o w have a very strong basis
for identification and intimate interconnectedness. Each has b e c o m e dependent
upon the other for achieving their future business strategy.
Next, assess the quality and type of trust currently in existence. As Arrow
(1973) indicates, some trust is always present in a business relationship. Look for
a discrepancy between what is and what should be.
Additionally, consider the best way of building trust. Recognize that the
development of trust takes time and that the creation of conditions for trust is
less relevant than taking advantage of the opportunities created by the bases.
Then, pick a plan and try it!
Finally, assess your trust-building activities as you move along in the process,
and adjust your course as necessary, In particular, look for business opportunities that accrue from changes in the relationship as it evolves. You may have had
one thing in mind in deciding to change the nature of trust in the relationship
but discover with some thought that many other opportunities are provided by a
redefined relationship. In some form, this process becomes seff-rein£orcing. As
trust builds, n e w opportunities suggest themselves, w h i c h then serve as n e w
bases for trust. Evaluate these opportunities with a clear mind. Over-dependence
and the wrong kind of dependence are as harnlful as insufficient d e p e n d e n c e in
a business relationship. Love can be blind, but no person, department, or firm is
an island tmto itself.
In these fractured renditions of two folk truths is revealed the paradoxical
nature of trust (see Smith and Berg, 1987). One cannot begin to establish trust
unless some level of trust is assumed, but one does not wish to assume trust
unless some basis for trust exists. Our advice is to select business partners with
care, and just begin. The development of trust is a jouruey, and one needs to
begin somewhere.

Conclusion
We believe that it is possible to create and sustain trust, leading to significant
benefits fbr business relationships. We recognize that the existence of all bases
of trust may be infrequent or costly, and requiring t h e m all to be p r e s e n t
severely restricts the number of occasions managers can use a handshake as the
basis for agreement. This may explain w h y some (Fisher and Ury, 1991) have
cautioned managers and negotiators not to rely on trust at all. Instead of avoiding the issue of trust, however, we encourage managers to think about h o w they
can design business relationships so they include the conditions warranted by
