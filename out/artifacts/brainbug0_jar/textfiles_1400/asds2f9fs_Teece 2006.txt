Abstract
How innovators capture value from innovation is an enduring question. Two decades ago an effort was made in “Profiting
from Innovation” to unlock this conundrum. This paper reflects on the framework offered, identifies and reviews the analytical
foundations of the theory, and recognizes subsequent contributions and advancements. Linkages are also made to the strategic
management literature on “resources” and “dynamic capabilities”. Elements of a Schumpeterian theory of the firm are outlined,
along with a framework to assist management in designing technology commercialization strategies.

1. Introduction
Twenty years after the publication of “Profiting from
Innovation” (PFI) in this journal (Teece, 1986), the question asked therein continues to capture the interests of
scholars and managers alike. The positive reception the
paper has received1 is no doubt in part because the

questions posed are seminal. Another reason may be
because it joined the analysis of innovation and the field
of business strategy, providing a parsimonious framework for explicating known conundrums about innovation, market entry timing, and subsequent marketplace success and failure. At a more abstract level, the
article outlined key elements of a Schumpeterian theory of the business enterprise and innovation. In this
paper, an effort is made to identify and evaluate the
conceptual foundations of PFI, to suggest refinements
and extensions, while making connections to subsequent developments in the literature on strategy and
innovation.

power, as if that was all that mattered. A whole panoply
of empirical studies followed as industrial organization
scholars focused on exploring the relationship between
market structure and innovation.2 Unfortunately, few
of these studies broke out of the Schumpeterian mold
and looked much beyond market structure and firm size
as drivers of innovation. Not surprisingly, these studies
were inconclusive. Mansfield (1968) summarized them
adequately almost a half a century ago; and the evidence
today is not substantially different:
“Contrary to the allegations of Galbraith, Schumpeter,
and others, there is little evidence that industrial giants
are needed in all or even most industries to ensure
rapid technological change and rapid utilization of
new techniques. Moreover, there is no statistically
significant relationship between the extent of concentration in an industry and the industry’s rate of
technological change . . .”

2. A post-Schumpeterian theory of the ﬁrm
2.1. Determinants of the rate of direction of
technological advance
Economists had long theorized about the factors that
drive technological innovation. The central focus, at least
since Schumpeter (1950), has been rather narrowly on
the role of market structure and firm size as determinants
of enterprise innovation. As Sidney Winter points out in
his contribution to this special issue, Schumpeter highlighted the contradiction between perfectly competitive
market structures and innovation. He saw perfect competition as incompatible with innovation because perfect
competition does not provide the innovator with a sufficient watershed to appropriate enough of the returns
from innovation to justify investment in R&D. At least in
Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (1950), Schumpeter saw the large enterprise with large market shares
as the solution to the appropriability problem, as a significant market presence would facilitate capture of the
returns from innovation. However, other than quite general references to the ability of large organizations to
finance innovation, absorb risk, and earn monopoly profits, Schumpeter did not give the particulars about what it
is about larger enterprises that might assist with appropriability. Nor did he explore the mechanisms by which
incumbency might serve as a disadvantage to innovative
activity.
Subsequent theoretical work in the Schumpeterian
tradition fixated on market structure as a proxy for market

The PFI framework represented a strong break
with the received industrial organization tradition. PFI
hypothesized that appropriability, and success at innovation more generally, is related not so much to the
innovator’s exante market share, but to the (complementary) asset structure of the innovator, management’s
market entry timing decisions, and the contractual structures employed to access missing complementary assets.
Choices with respect to the latter should depend on the
asset positioning of other market participants, and on
the intellectual property protection available. The PFI
framework enveloped a far wider panoply of factors than
had hitherto been addressed in the economic analysis of
innovation.
While occasionally cited favorably by industrial organization theorists, the PFI framework has not been universally embraced by industrial organizational scholars. One reason may be that it is implicitly hostile to
received theory. However, with respect to antitrust policy, the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission Guidelines on joint ventures makes use of some of
the ideas in PFI, especially the idea of complementary
assets3 ; but there is not a cite to PFI.
In any event, in developing the PFI framework, I
was conscious of the extensive but moribund literature
in industrial organization surrounding the innovation-

that the concept is identical to what in PFI is defined as complementary
assets. See United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission, Guidelines on Joint Ventures, 1995, p. 5.

market structure nexus.4 It was clear that mainstream
industrial organization was intellectually conservative
and would not likely embrace a framework that eschewed
market structure as the principal determinant of enterprise level innovative performance. Accordingly, I chose
to direct the article to innovation studies and strategy scholars. As Sidney Winter points out, the market
structure–conduct–performance paradigm from industrial organization economics has not turned out to be
analytically all that helpful in the study of innovation.
The promise of the PFI framework, based as it is on contracting and strategizing, is that it has more to offer to
both strategists and economic theorists alike.
2.2. Foundations
PFI endeavors to explicate how managerial choices,
the nature of knowledge, intellectual property protection,
and the asset structure of the firm impact the business
enterprise’s ability to capture value from innovation. It
is both a predictive and a normative theory of strategy, with testable hypotheses. It not only provides a
contingency theory with respect to a key element of
strategy – such as whether to license or not to license
– but it also predicts how the profits from innovation are
likely to be distributed as between customer, innovator,
imitator, suppliers and the owner’s of complementary
assets. It might be thought of as a nascent neo Schumpeterian theory of the firm. The success of the article
is in part due to the fact that it was built upon and
around what are now recognized as important conceptual
building blocks in our understanding of innovation processes and competitive strategy. I briefly identify these
below.
2.2.1. Dominant design, entry, timing, and learning
Abernathy and Utterback (1978) were amongst the
first to hypothesize that the nature of competition
amongst technologies alters with the emergence of a
“dominant design”. This was an important insight. Over
the past two decades, considerable additional evidence
has been assembled supporting the emergence of dominant designs [e.g. Klepper and Graddy (1990), Utterback
and Suarez (1993) and Utterback (1994)]. There is also
considerable research focusing on why certain product designs became dominant. David (1985) and Arthur
(1989) rely on dynamic increasing returns as a key
explanatory variable. Under such conditions, those that

the market structure-innovation framework.

get ahead tend to stay ahead. The more a technology is
employed, the greater its attraction relative to the alternatives. This phenomenon can be fueled by the cumulative
nature of technical advance, by learning (both producer
and consumer), and by network externalities. When the
basis of competition shifts (from product to process) with
the emergence of a dominant design there are clear managerial implications. The PFI framework recognizes that
pioneers frequently fail in the marketplace, particularly
(but not only) when they lack intellectual property protection. First mover advantages and path dependencies
are very important to the Arthur and David contributions.
PFI offered new insights with respect to market entry
timing. One clear implication is that there is no one right
answer, such as it is always good to be the first mover.
Timing depends on what assets you have got (Mitchell,
1989). The framework identified several classes of contingency factors including the innovators ready and cost
effective access to complementary assets, and the point
at which the dominant design emerges. Both classes of
factors should impact entry-timing decisions.
The discussion in PFI of timing with respect to the
emergence of a dominant design also has embedded
within it recognition of the importance of learning and
experimentation. As noted in Teece (1986) “at some
point in time, and after considerable trial and error in
the marketplace, one design or a narrow class of designs
begins to emerge as the more promising. Such a design
must be able to meet a whole set of user needs in a
relatively complete fashion” (p. 288). In this way, the
framework recognized the importance of experimentation and learning, although this was not a theme developed in any depth. In some cases the innovator is able to
improve upon its own initial market entry, e.g. Xerox’s
initial model A Xerographic printer was messy, hard-touse, and slow. It was not a serious challenge to carbon
paper; but the Xerox model 914 introduced 10 years later
transformed the business office and “secretarial” work.
Sometimes learning is serendipitous—the Pfizer drug
Sildenfil was first tested in humans in 1991 for effectiveness for angina. Male patients reported erections as a
side effect, and Pfizer initiated a program to test the compound for erectile dysfunction, culminating in 1998 in
the successful launch of Viagra, which has subsequently
become a blockbuster drug. This of course does not mean
we should venerate failure for itself; but it is important
to recognize that having a bias for action and willingness
to risk failure are important components of learning. The
VCR example cited in PFI where Ampex was the first
into the market (but failed to sustain the multiple rounds
of product improvement necessary to bring the product
down to the price points and the physical size required to

<-----Page 3----->1134

break open a mass market) demonstrates the importance
of management having the vision, and the enterprise having the financial and organizational resources, to “stay
in the game” until the dominant design emerges.
2.2.2. Appropriability regime
Until the publication of “Profiting from Innovation”,
there were only very limited efforts in the strategy literature to study notions of imitability, and to explicitly consider how intellectual property and the nature
of knowledge impacts appropriability and technology
commercialization strategies. This has now changed.
A key insight in PFI was that imitability is a function of both legal impediments (patents, copyrights,
trade secrets, trade marks) and the inherent replicability of the technology,5 which depends in part on whether
the know-how is tacit or codified. The “appropriability
regime” has become a recognized concept in strategy,
and PFI was where it was first introduced into the field.
PFI was also where tacit knowledge itself first entered
the management/strategy literature,6 with Nonaka and
colleagues at Hitotsubashi University and elsewhere subsequently extending and leveraging the concept of tacit
knowledge to explain knowledge creation and knowledge management.
Another feature of PFI is that it underscores, and
helps explain, how an innovator’s intellectual property
protection ought impact strategic decisions. The PFI
framework also makes it abundantly clear that the enterprise’s intellectual property portfolio cannot be managed
independent of its business strategy, and that business
strategy formulation requires an appreciation of intellectual property issues. However, in PFI, there was
limited development of intellectual property strategy
itself.7 Importantly, intellectual property protection is
represented as just one amongst many barriers to imitation. The nature of knowledge (especially the degree to
which it is tacit) and its inherent replicability is another.
Although PFI highlighted the role of dominant designs,
it did not fully develop the role of standards, and standard setting bodies, on the innovation process. Nor did it
explore the interaction between standards and intellectual property protection. In particular, a useful technology can sometimes take on additional value if it becomes
5 The discussion of legal impediments was static, when in fact
intellectual property protection is dynamic. Patents, for instance, can
undergo a life cycle (Sherry and Teece, 2004).

and Teece (1981).

Teece (2000).

formally or informally selected as a standard. I have
explored some of these issues in subsequent research
(Sherry and Teece, 2003).
2.2.3. Complementary assets and cospecialization
Perhaps the most important contribution of PFI is that
it defined and developed a taxonomy around complementary assets and technologies: specialized, cospecialized, and generic. The extant literature in economics and
strategy at the time made no mention of complementary
assets. Economic historians had recognized the importance of complementarities, but their analysis was rather
loose. As discussed earlier, Schumpeter (1950) had a
visceral sense that there was something about the large
enterprise that helped it appropriate returns from innovation, but his explanation was limited to market level
monopoly power issues. The PFI framework zeroed in on
the asset structure of the firm itself, and specialized complementary assets in particular. Market “power” analysis
was done at the asset rather than the market level, and
centered on availability of alternatives and/or ease of
replicability. This in turn is likely to depend on whether
the “asset” is generic (in which it is likely to be available
in competitive supply) or specialized.
Clearly, control of an asset does not imply control
of a market, unless the asset somehow defines a “relevant market”.8 If the asset is specialized, it is more
likely to be difficult to replicate. This will affect the
distribution of returns from innovation. The services it
provides is likely to face competition, which will hold
down the economic returns on the assets. Owners of
such assets cannot expect any special benefit from innovation, even when innovation increases demand for the
services of the complementary assets. This more granular supply side approach to assessing competition is
what sets the PFI framework apart from the Schumpeterian framework. Clearly, incumbency is viewed in
a dramatically different manner in PFI than in Schumpeter, and in the economics literature more generally.
The complementary assets notion has also found applicability in applied frameworks (Sullivan, 2000; Harrison
and Sullivan, 2006).
The evidence with respect to the importance of complementary assets to innovation outcomes has evolved
beyond PFI. Helfat (1997) found that firms with more
complementary assets in the form of coal reserves undertook greater amounts of R&D in synthetic fuels derived
from coal. In generic pharmaceuticals, Scott Morton

8

I am using “relevant market” in the antitrust sense. For a discussion
of relevant markets, see Hartman et al. (1993).

<-----Page 4----->D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

(1999) found that the proclivity to enter new markets
was greater where there was similarity in manufacturing,
distribution, and marketing. Tripsas (2001) observed that
when computer technology began to take on a key role
in typesetting, the new entrants were often established
computer companies. Helfat and Raubitschek’s (2000)
analysis of the Japanese electronics industry showed that
business firms repeatedly built on their pre-entry core
technology and complementary assets to introduce new
products in new subfields.
In Teece et al. (1997) and in Teece (2006b) the role
that complementary assets play in shaping evolutionary paths, and potentially fueling anti-cannibalization
biases, has also been developed. Put differently, complementary assets do not just play a role in appropriability; they also potentially shape going forward enterprise
strategy, sometimes positively (in terms of returns to
innovation) and sometimes negatively.
The distinctions made between specialized and
generic complementary assets have also been built
on and extended by others, included Chatterjee and
Wernerfelt (1991) and Helfat and Lieberman (2002). The
latter correctly note that there is a continuum between
resources that are specialized to a particular setting and
generalized resources that can be applied more broadly
in many environmental settings. They also make a useful
distinction (their Table 4) between core and complementary resources, which fits snuggly within PFI.
The contracting/strategy framework advanced in PFI
builds on transactions cost economics (TCE). However,
it also embraces imitability/replicability issues. Such
analysis is also the essential domain of the resourcebased theory of the firm, which is explored in Section
5.
There have been other attempts to develop strategy
frameworks which highlight complements. A decade
after PFI, Brandenberg and Nalebuff (1996) published
Co-opetition. Their framework emphasized the importance of complements in competitive analysis. They discussed the universality of the principle, although most of
their examples were demand side (e.g. computer hardware and software as complements). They highlight the
strategic exposure firms have when they are missing certain complementary assets (p. 14), and rightfully stress
that “thinking complements is a different way of thinking about business” (p. 14). However, they do not use
the taxonomy found in PFI, with its distinction between
specific and generic complementary assets (see Fig. 1).
Nor do they employ a contracting framework. Hence,
they cannot address make versus buy decision very well.
As a result, their treatment does not help explain the
distribution of returns to innovation.

1135

It should also be recognized that the distribution
of returns from innovation depends, interalia, on the
innovator’s relative positioning in specialized complementary assets Fig. 11 in Teece (1986). This figure is
reproduced more elegantly here as Fig. 2.
Furthermore, as discussed in Section 5, the development of contracting/strategizing concepts around complementary assets has embedded within it the core component of an economic theory of management, which
I have subsequently outlined in Teece (2006a,b). The
essence of the idea is that a core economic function
of managers in the economy is to create value by figuring out and organizing asset combinations that yield
economies of scale and scope as well as appropriability
benefits. When complementary assets are idiosyncratic
and cannot be obtained through marketplace transactions, some form of internal organization is required
instead. I harbor the belief that this is a fundamental
post Chandlerian concept.9
Developing a theory of management based on PFI
is central to my going forward research program. In
economic theory, managers are banished from the economic system. There is simply no role for them to play in
making markets work or organizing economic activity.
PFI is one small step in the direction of a Schumpeterian theory of management and the firm. In PFI, managers/executives play a critical asset orchestration role
inside the firm. The flow diagram (Fig. 10) in PFI outlines the strategic choices that managers are advised to
make.10 Then of course they must execute on the strategy, and do so proficiently.
2.2.4. The market for know-how
Embedded in the PFI framework is also a recognition
that intellectual property rights lubricate the market for
know-how. The contracting framework recognizes that
strong intellectual property rights facilitate (licensing)
transactions in the market for know-how; and that absent
intellectual property rights, the market for know-how
will be less efficient. This is of course a very “Coasian”
notion.11 Other scholars including Arora et al. (2001)
have taken these ideas beyond where they were left in
PFI. The existence of fabless semi-conductor companies is testament to the fact that exclusive reliance on
intellectual property licensing can be a viable business
model, although the travails that Rambus has encountered recently in securing its intellectual property, and

getting infringers to pay royalties, speaks to the risks of
relying exclusively on contractual (licensing) modes.
3. Analytical design
3.1. Problem selection
One important feature of PFI was that it framed an
important strategic question, and it did so in a way that
was tractable. A good research question is one that, if
answered, yields important insights and is refutable (i.e.
in the Popperian sense, it is at least conceivably falsifiable). The research question in PFI was not framed as
“understanding the foundations of innovative success”.
Such a question would be too broad, and the answer
would require a three-volume treatise. The PFI framework was less ambitious. Its purpose was to understand
the factors that impact success at commercialisation, i.e.
not success at invention itself, not success in terms of
who was first-to-market, and not success in terms of
understanding the long run profitability of the enterprise.
Rather, PFI focused more narrowly on success in terms of
which entities ultimately capture significant shares of the

available profits from a particular innovation. This was,
and remains, one of the most important enterprise level
questions one could ask. Yet no one had asked it before,
and ironically, no one has asked it since (in the sense that
no one has tried to displace the PFI framework).
By posing the question in terms of understanding
success at commercialization, one critical observation
and several important questions were explicitly and/or
implicitly posed. The question drew attention to a phenomenon, which was well understood in industry and in
policy circles, but had not been addressed fully by academics. This question was this: why is it that innovators
(i.e. firms that succeed in bringing innovative products
and processes to market) commonly fail to capture value
from their investments. In the prior literature it was
well recognized that inventors might be denied commercial rewards if their invention lacked commercial utility.
However, that was not the same as explaining why it is
that even when an inventor actually gets the product into
the market, the inventor may still fail to reap rewards.
Complicating matters is the fact that innovation is not
a well-defined homogenous activity with a start date and
an end date. Most innovations evolve through some kind

of cycle, with subsequent improvements often vastly
more important than the initial innovation. Innovators
and “imitators” often build on each other. The complexity associated with understanding innovation and the
distribution of the “spillover” benefits from it is such
that had the question been framed any broader, I doubt
it would have been tractable.
3.2. The analytical separation between invention
and commercialization
A key feature of the analytical design is that, as
explained earlier, a separation between invention and
commercialization was made in PFI. The separation
is akin to March’s (1991) distinction between exploration and exploitation; or the distinction between sensing and seizing which is embedded in Teece (2006b).
As I note elsewhere (Teece, 1988, 1992a), in theory,
one could imagine transactions between entities that
scout out and/or develop opportunities, and those that
endeavor to execute upon them. In reality, the two func-

tions cannot be cleanly separated, and the activities must
take place inside a single enterprise, where new insights
about markets – particularly those that challenge the
conventional wisdom – will likely encounter negative
responses.
I am not entirely sure that Jim March is right in suggesting that firms cannot and should not specialize in
either exploration or exploitation. The jury is still out.
I note companies like Dolby and Rambus have decided
to stay focused on invention, and simply license their
technologies. However, the issue can be examined at
multiple levels. Aside from strategic considerations, the
question remains as to whether there is a useful analytical
separation that can be made between invention and commercialization functions. I believe there is, and I believe
the PFI framework demonstrates that utility.
3.3. A framework or a theory?
A framework, like a model, abstracts from realty.
It endeavors to identify classes of variables, and their

<-----Page 7----->1138

D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

interrelationships. A framework is less rigorous than a
model as it is sometimes agnostic about the particular
form of theoretical relationships which may exist. PFI
is more than a framework. It is a falsifiable theory about
innovation and it predicts outcomes in the marketplace
(PFI, Fig. 1112 ). It not only indicates rules with respect
to elements of the desired strategy; it predicts whether
the innovator or the imitator will get the lion’s share
of the rents, depending on the appropriability regime,
market timing, and the ownership of complementary
assets.
Although important empirical work has been done
(and was cited earlier), exploring the importance of complementary assets and capabilities, testing the PFI theory
has not as yet been comprehensively accomplished. Such
a test might be facilitated by data sets of the following
kind: For the dependant variable: (i) a sample of inventions showing the identity of the entity that commercialized the invention; (ii) at least a rank ordering of the market share and/or profit earned in the marketplace over the
life of the innovation (and possibly subsequent followons as a measure of the share of profits captured). Independent variables might include: (i) data on the positioning of innovators/imitators with respect to access to complementary assets. This would require an assessment not
just of ownership, but whether the complementary asset
is a “bottleneck” or a “choke point” in the value chain;
(ii) assessment of the appropriability regime (weak or
strong might suffice, although more granular treatments
are possible); (iii) entry timing: identifying whether it
is before or after the dominant design has emerged, and
whether the new product is consistent with the dominant
design.
3.4. PFI as a strategy paper
“Strategy is the deliberate search for a plan of action
that will develop a business’s competitive advantage and
compound it. For any company, the search is an iterative
process that begins with a recognition of where you are
and what you have now—the differences between you
and your competitors are the basis of your advantage”
(Henderson, 1991, p. 5). Under this definition, put forward by one of the fields practicing founding fathers, PFI
is unquestionably a “strategy” paper. It frames important strategic decisions and explicitly takes into account
the business environment, adding new elements such as
the appropriability regime, and the technology cycle. It
also explicitly takes into account differential position12

ing, recognizing each firm’s command of the technology, ownership of intellectual property rights, and its
positioning in complementary assets. Indeed, the paper
arguably belonged in the Strategic Management Journal,
but I really did not know much about the field of strategy
in those days.13
Perhaps another reason for the articles popularity is
that it is avowedly normative and focuses on strategic
decisions. A derivative version of the flow chart (Fig. 10)
on PFI is reproduced here (for the case of weak appropriability) from Teece (1992b) as Fig. 3. Indeed, as Gary
Pisano notes in this special issue, one of the contributions
of PFI is that it brought the innovation studies literature
into the field of strategy, and vice versa. In Chapter 5
of Teece (2000), the article was rewritten and put more
explicitly in managerial language. It was “repurposed”
as “Market Entry Strategies for Innovators”.
4. Reﬁnements to PFI
While I am pleased that PFI has had a positive reception, there are many ways in which the paper could be
refined, extended and improved. I discuss some of these
below:
4.1. Complementary innovations
As discussed earlier, PFI was one of the first (if not
the first) strategy papers to highlight the role of complementary assets. Nevertheless, the development and
analysis of complementarities was limited. As I noted,
“In almost all cases, the successful commercialization
of innovation requires that the know-how in question
be utilized in conjunction with other capabilities or
assets” (Teece, 1986, p. 288). Complementary technologies were treated as just another complementary
asset.
At the time of publication, the importance that complementary technologies play in the innovation process
was not recognized in the contemporary strategy literature. However, they were recognized by the business
and technology historians. Historians argued that if one
critical piece of technology was absent, or not sufficiently well developed, the rest of the product (or system)
would fail. In short, technology can be a bottleneck asset
(or as Hughes (1983) calls it, a “reverse salient”). For

13

The late Keith Pavitt, coeditor of Research Policy at the time,
solicited the paper after the Venice conference in March 1986. I was
very pleased to have it published where it might catch the attention of
those most interested in innovation.

instance, electric cars require better batteries to compete
with internal combustion engine powered automobiles.
Digital photography could take off only once low cost
flash memory became available, along with controller
technology.
Many technologies today are systemic. Successful
commercialization requires bringing together complementary technology as well as complementary patents.
This is what I referred to elsewhere as the “multiinvention” context (see Somaya and Teece, 2006). Of
course, many innovations require complementary infrastructure investments (for the automobile, roads and service stations; for electricity, long-life light bulbs plus

generators, transmission lines, and standards). However,
the focus of PFI was much more on enterprise level value
chains.
4.2. Supporting infrastructure
Fig. 3 in PFI (refined and reproduced here as Fig. 1)
displays core know-how at the center, and then a circle of
complementary assets and technologies needed to commercialize the innovation. These complementary assets
and technologies are implicitly thought of as belonging to private sector firms located somewhere in the
marketplace.

<-----Page 9----->1140

D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

An obvious extension of this framework would be
to create a second concentric circle enveloping the first.
The second circle would recognize supporting institutions. Social technologies often constrain physical technology, and the commercialization of innovation itself.
The ecosystem that is relevant clearly includes not just
owners of complementary assets but also regulators, educational institutions, standard setting bodies, and the
courts.
New institutions and new laws and the provision of
complementary assets may all be necessary before certain innovations can be deployed. For instance, Bell Laboratories pioneering work on cellular telephony could
not go anywhere until the Federal Government allocated
electromagnetic spectrum to carry wireless signals. Collective action by public authorities is frequently required
to bring new technologies into existence. Neutral or competence enhancing innovations is often easier for the
enterprise to embrace as they do not confront accepted
ways of doing things. Veblen (1915) was one of the first
to articulate that maintaining national competitiveness
requires the nation state to put in place institutions that
support new technologies. PFI did not pay much attention to these considerations. The role of institutions has
been highlighted by writers like North (1990) and Nelson
(2005).
A full discussion of supporting institutions and
National Systems of Innovation could of course easily
involve book length treatment. PFI deliberately avoided
going down this path, because within a nation state
institutions do not necessarily tip the scales in favor
of one or another market participant, except inasmuch
as particular firms, either through individual or collective action, can help shape institutions and standard
setting decisions. In the global context, it is of course
different.

4.4. Role of ﬁnance
In terms of supporting institutions, PFI (deliberately)
failed to explore this issue, except inasmuch as the decision framework recognized that the innovator’s cash
position should be considered in assessing whether to
rent, build, or buy complementary assets. This cavalier
treatment is of course very much at odds with classical treatments. There is a long tradition going back to
Schumpeter and beyond which emphasizes the importance of access to risk capital, whether from internal
or external sources. In PFI, the implicit assumption
was made that risk capital was available from a company’s own balance sheet, the venture capital community, alliance partners, or commercial banks. Indeed, the
existence today of well developed venture and private
equity markets, public equity markets, and debt markets
is a reasonable justification for abstracting from financial
issues. It is not an egregious abstraction.
4.5. Decision framework
Part of the simplicity and possibly the elegance of PFI
is that it does not confront the organizational, bureaucratic, or human side of business decision-making. Its
written in the rational choice mode. In this sense, the
paper is not pretending to be descriptive with respect
to decision-making processes in organizations. There is
a large literature on over-optimism in project evaluation (Merrow et al., 1981). The PFI framework does not
endeavor to prescribe rules, protocols, or procedures to
neutralize such errors. For instance, imposing an “outside view” (Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993) is likely to
assist in generating less biased decisions. These issues
were neglected in PFI.
4.6. “Supply” chain issues

4.3. Capabilities
PFI preceded the emergence in the strategy field of the
“capabilities” literature. Notwithstanding that, PFI did
utilize capabilities thinking, at least in a cursory way.
The notion the complementary assets might represent
capabilities, and that if the firm did not have them, it
would need to build them, and if it did not have time to
build them, it might need to buy them was central to the
paper. In short, a decision tree was created in which it
was implicitly recognized that capabilities were at least
partially path dependent, and that at least in the very short
run, the firm is stuck with what its got. Evolutionary
thinking is obviously not far below the surface. These
issues are explored in more detail in Section 5.

PFI had a very simple decision rule: if in doubt, outsource. Put differently, decision rules were loaded to
favor outsourcing and collaboration, unless there were
a compelling reasons to internalize. Such reasons could
be grounded in one of two major circumstances: (a)
cospecialization, which would lead to transaction costs
if heavy reliance was made externally; (b) shoring up the
appropriability situation by building or buying complementary assets which the innovation would likely drive
up in value, or that were otherwise important to getting
the job done. Here the decision rules rest on both (i) capability considerations and (ii) availability considerations,
and (iii) change in asset price considerations. In essence,
(iii) reflects real options type reasoning.

<-----Page 10----->D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

Hirshleifer (1971) was perhaps the first to argue that
ownership of (complementing) assets – but not necessarily cospecialized assets – could enhance the innovator’s
returns. However, Hirshleifer had a very narrow view of
the role of complements. He saw innovation as impacting asset values, and profiting from innovation PFI was
about how to take long positions in assets likely to appreciate because of an innovation. Taking short positions in
assets likely to decline is certainly consistent with PFI.
Hirshleifer’s perspective is a rather Kirznerian view of
innovation, and dramatically underplays the functional
role of complementarities, focusing instead merely on
fluctuations in asset values.
Notwithstanding this, PFI was prescient in indicating that the supply chain and complementary
assets/technologies should be thought of as choice variables in terms of enterprise level integration decisions.
It also implied that those decisions should be made on
transaction costs as well as capability and asset pricing criterion. Indeed, it is appropriate to characterize the
PFI framework as being richer than transaction cost economics (Williamson, 1985), as it embraces asset pricing
and disequilibrium notions along with contractual and
transaction cost issues.

during the 19th century after the emergence of steam
(Giliffan, 1935). Usually the older technologies become
relegated to particular niches.
Moreover, it is also important to recognize that any
particular dominant design is not necessarily the “best”.
In the presence of network externalities, that which gets
ahead, stays ahead and small “accidents” early in the
choices of technology can lead to a dominant design that
by some criteria is inferior. This is of course David’s
(1985) and Arthur’s (1989) account of the path dependent evolution of technologies.
Furthermore, the presence of network effects means
that early and sizable investment is necessary to try
and get a standard (or dominant design) accepted in the
market. Consumers do not want to be saddled with an
installed base that affords limited network benefits. This
does not change the story entirely in PFI, but it does
suggest that the stakes are even higher than was perhaps signaled. Standard sponsoring is a risky activity,
but can yield significant returns if the standard catches.
Competition to “own” the standard (or the dominant
design) becomes, in some ways, competition for the
market.
4.8. The (multi-invention) licensing option

4.7. Standards, increasing returns, and network
effects
In PFI, it was recognized that the emergence of a
“dominant design” in an industry would lead to a “regime
switch” or an “inflexion point”. As designs stabilized,
the terms of competition would change from features to
price. The importance of investing so as to support the
dominant design flowed from the need to capture customers early, and to achieve economies of scale. The
first mover advantage, if there was one, would not even
begin until the marketplace and/or some standard setting body anointed a particular design as a standard. Of
course, not all standards “take” in the market, even if a
standard setting body agrees on a standard.
A relatively new literature, nascent at the time, outlined by Brian Arthur and his colleagues, and later
augmented by my colleagues Katz and Shapiro (1994)
emphasized network effects and increasing returns. But
this literature was generally silent on issues of learning
or appropriability.
One should recognize that the emergence of a dominant design, if it occurs, is never a crisp watershed. The
old and the new often coexist, and the new keeps evolving because of user experience and feedback (Rosenberg,
1982). Sometimes the replaced technology actually gets
a “second wind”, at least for a while, as did sailing ships

PFI utilizes a very simple view of technology licensing, because the analytical framework utilized assumes,
for simplicity, a single innovation. The licensing story
advanced in PFI is as a result a rather simple one. However, in many industries today, particularly those where
systematic innovation if of importance, like microelectronics and biotechnology, multiple inventions (or items
of know-how and intellectual property) are very common. The implications of this are significant in that PFI
requires access to, and possibly control/ownership of
complementary technologies, as discussed in PFI and
as elaborated in Section 2.2.3.
Another characteristic, not mentioned in PFI, is that
the dominant mode of licensing, especially amongst
incumbent firms, is cross licensing, with or without balancing payments (Grindley and Teece, 1997). Another
implication is that firms with valuable patent protected
technology in regimes of cumulative innovation may
eschew own production in order to strengthen their
hand in licensing and cross licensing negotiations. For
instance, Qualcomm exited the production of cellular
telephone handsets embodying its Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) to strengthen its hand at
licensing, as it would no longer need to cross license if it
was not engaged in production of a “system” (handsets)
that would undoubtedly infringe on potential licensees’

<-----Page 11----->1142

D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

intellectual property. Likewise, Texas Instruments
decided to exit the manufacture of DRAMS in part to
strengthen its leverage with potential licensees during
cross license negotiations.14 In short, the dynamics of
licensing negotiations are such that there is sometimes
an “inverse complementary” – or (private) diseconomies
– associated with both licensing and own production.
That is, mixed modes with both licensing competitors
and own production are sometimes incompatible – as the
Texas Instruments and Qualcomm examples illustrate.
4.9. PFI and the new emphasis on intangibles and
knowledge management
Over the last two decades – and certainly since the
publication of PFI – there has been a vigorous movement
to stress the value and role of intangibles in business
strategy and money management. Proponents of this
movement, with which I am generally very sympathetic,
stress that “intangible asset investing is the fundamental
business trend for the 1990s” and beyond (Parr, 1991,
p. vii). PFI obviously has one leg in this camp; indeed,
the essence of PFI is to stress the value that can arise
from innovation—particularly when that innovation is
protected by strong intellectual property rights and where
the innovator owns the relevant complementary assets.
Indeed, the framework highlights how know-how, and
difficult to replicate assets more generally, enable enterprises to generate rents. It also stresses the importance
of knowledge integration and knowledge conversion,
which is the subject matter of Nonaka and Toyama’s
important contributions.15
However, unlike the sometimes over enthusiastic
endorsements of intangibles as a source of “hidden
value”, the PFI framework makes it apparent that it is by
no means uncommon that intangibles create zero value
for those who have invested in their creation. Indeed,
absent the innovating enterprise being able to both design
and execute on strategies along the lines of those outlined
in PFI, there should not be any presumption that investment in intangibles will pay off. Indeed, it is suggested
that PFI is a proper framework for evaluating intangibles. Absent consideration of complementary assets, it

14

In theory, the size of a royalty base should be an equalizing factor in
the sense that if a licensor like Qualcom had relatively limited production using other companies intellectual property, this should not detract
significantly from its ability to extract value from its technology. However, the ability to threaten mutual injunctions may well tend to lead
to “mutually assured destruction”, and removal of this symmetry can
increase the bargaining power of licensor.
15 See Nonaka and Toyama (2004).

is hard to see how advice with respect to the management
of intangible assets can be expertly created.
4.10. Other elements of the business model
Perhaps the biggest weakness in PFI was the narrow
and somewhat mechanical manner in which “business
model” issues were delineated. The product/services
architecture, and the business model, defines the manner by which the enterprise delivers value to customers,
entices customers to pay for value, and converts those
payments to profit. It is the innovator’s hypothesis about
what customers want and how an enterprise can go about
meeting those needs, getting paid well for doing so, and
hopefully avoiding losing out to imitators. It explains:
(1) which technologies and features are to be embedded in the product and service; (2) how the revenue and
cost structure of a business is to be “designed” and if
necessary “redesigned” to meet customer needs; (3) the
way in which technologies are to be assembled; (4) the
identity of market segments to be targeted; (5) the mechanisms and manner by which value is to be captured. The
function of a business model is to “articulate” the value
proposition, select the appropriate technologies and features, identify targeted market segments, define the structure of the value chain, and estimate the cost structure
and profit potential (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002,
pp. 533–534). In short, a business model is a plan for the
organizational and financial “architecture” of a business,
which makes valid assumptions about the behavior of
revenues and costs, and likely customer and competitor
behavior. It outlines the contours of the solution required
to make money. Once adopted it defines the way the
enterprise “goes to market”. Success requires that business models be astutely crafted. Otherwise, inventions
would not result in commercial success.
Generally there are a number of business models
that can be employed, but some will be better than others. Selecting, adjusting and/or improving the model are
likely to be critical to commercial success. It involves
distilling insights to customers, suppliers, competitors,
and the marketplace in general. Nevertheless, the importance of “business models” has been given short shrift
in the innovation literature. Important (business model)
choices involve technologies, market segments to be targeted, sales versus leasing arrangements for customer
access to the product, bundled v. unbundled sales, joint
ventures v. go-it-alone strategies, etc. For example, in
the early days of the copier industry, Xerox focused on
leasing rather than selling copiers. This stemmed from
a belief that customer trial would lead to further use.
Another example from the U.S. is Southwest Airlines

<-----Page 12----->D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

who believe that most customers want low frills, reliability, and low cost. Southwest eschews the hub-and-spoke
model, does not belong to any alliances, and does not
allow interlining of passengers and baggage. Nor does it
sell tickets through travel agencies—all sales are direct.
All aircraft are Boeing 737s. Its business model is quite
distinct from the major carriers, although many have
tried (without much success) to copy elements of it.
The capacity an enterprise has to create, adjust, hone
and replace business models is important to success.16
Choices around how to capture value all help determine the architecture or design of a business. Having
a differentiated (and hard to imitate) yet effective and
efficient “strategic architecture” to an enterprise’s business model is critical to success. Both Dell Computer
and Wal-Mart have demonstrated the value associated
with their business models (Webvan and many other
dot com’s demonstrated just the opposite). Both Dell
and Wal-Mart’s business models were different, superior, and hard for competitors to replicate. They have
also constantly adjusted and improved their processes
over time.17
PFI somewhat narrowly defined the business model
decisions around complementary assets (make or buy)
according to the appropriability regime and cospecialization and (static) capability considerations. As noted,
there is much more to the choice of a business model
including: (a) the choice of features for the product,
including the form functions to be selected; (b) the customers to be targeted; (c) items to be bundled; (d) distribution channels to be selected and so forth. Clearly,
PFI is too simplified to capture all of these elements of
the business model. However, I have come to recognize
that getting the business model right is important to the
innovation process and to business performance more
generally.

16 Let us take a simple example. A rock star might decide to use concerts as the key revenue generator, or the concert may be used primarily
to stimulate sales of recordings. The star could decide to spend less
time performing at concerts, and more time in the recording studio.
There is clearly a choice of various mediums to extract value: live productions, movies, sale of CDs through stores, on line sale of music
through virtual stores such as the iTunes store offered by Apple Computer, etc. The emergence of the Internet, Napster, and Napster clones
in turn requires artists (and recording studios) to rethink their business
models. The ability to reconfigure business models for delivering and
pricing music profitably is undoubtedly a dynamic capability for both
the recording studios and the artists.
17 Indeed, a critical element of Dell’s success is not just the way it has
organized the value chain, but also the products that it decides to sell
through its distribution system. The initial products were PCs, but now
include printers, digital projectors, and computer related electronics.

1143

5. PFI and the resource based theory of the ﬁrm
The PFI framework in a cursory way outlined the
importance of not just complementary assets but also
“resources”. Resources have been defined as stocks of
available factors that are owned or controlled by the
firm (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993, p. 35). My terminology around complementary assets recognized that some
complementary assets are generic and some are specialized. Generic complementary assets – although not the
key focus of PFI – may well be what Penrose (1959)
referred to as “fungible” resources.
The resources approach recognizes how (1) difficult
to imitate assets (including complementary assets) can be
the basis of differentiation and hence competitive advantage and (2) enterprise assets can be classified as either
fungible or generic. In Penrose’s theory of the growth of
the firm, certain assets are fungible and can be leveraged
to support diversification. Her emphasis was on the accumulation of resources, not their strategic orchestration.
PFI does, however, recognize how the competitive access
to cash on the balance sheet and timing with respect to
the accumulation of complementary assets can influence
outcomes. In this sense, PFI can be seen as an early
application of the resources based approach. Like the
resources approach it is not particularly “dynamic”.
The PFI framework, and its highlighting of complementary assets, goes to the very heart of the role of
management in the innovation process, and in enterprise activity more generally. The framework makes
clear that innovation creates new demands for certain
assets. Tushman and Anderson (1986) use the language
of “competency enhancing innovation” to signal the
impact that innovation can have on asset values. PFI
goes one step further. It differentiates between specialized assets, and generic assets available in competitive
supply. Even if demand for an asset if increased, its
value is unlikely to increase if it is available in competitive supply. Moreover, the Tushman and Anderson
approach suggests that owners of complementary assets
passively enjoy or suffer from the fallout from innovation. The PFI framework, in contrast, outlines the
strategic considerations which managers must reference
in order to capture value from innovation. It suggests
that proactive strategies are more likely to increase the
share of profits going to the innovator. The PFI framework in this regard also anticipates critical aspects of
the dynamic capabilities framework—in particular, the
notion that value can be created through the orchestration of cospecialized assets. Indeed, PFI was, I believe,
the first piece of scholarship to advance what I now
believe to be an important set of ideas in management

<-----Page 13----->1144

D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

and the theory of the firm: the notion that economic
profit, and hence enterprise value, is determined in substantial measure by the ability of management to build
and/or buy and then combine cospecialized assets that
yield scope economies and/or appropriability enhancement (Teece, 2006a). While PFI articulated the theory
in the context of innovation, it is perhaps considerably
more general and applies to any situation where value can
be provided in unique ways—including modest product
differentiation.
6. From PFI to dynamic capabilities
PFI isolates a set of strategic issues associated with
commercializing technological innovation. It is innovation specific. It asks what set of decision rules and strategic choices (given technological trajectories and the state
of play with respect to dominant design, appropriability conditions, and relative positioning with respect to
complementary assets) will enhance the share of profits
captured by the innovator. Of course, a completely symmetrical answer is given with respect to imitators. These
are essentially static questions. The PFI framework
does not seek to answer what factors are likely to lead
to sustainable competitive advantage at the enterprise
level.
The extended dynamic capabilities framework
(2006b) has the ecosystem as the center piece of an analytical framework within which firms can assess opportunities. The language of (complementary) assets, tangible
and intangible assets, and appropriability conditions all
define elements of an enterprise ecosystem.
Porter’s (1980) Five Forces framework by contrast
invites one to consider where to position the company
(taking industry structure as given) against competitive
forces. The essence of the strategist’s job, at least in the
first instance, is to position the firm where competitive
forces are weakest. Companies are also advised to take
the offensive, and try to shape competition by building
defenses (like brands).
Dynamic capabilities, like Five Forces, is merely
a framework. Key differences are that dynamic capabilities recognizes a whole panoply of factors in the
ecosystem which are absent from Porter’s Five Forces.
Moreover, the enterprise is specifically seen as engaging
in search activities to identify and calibrate opportunities. There is of course no one right way to do this. Once
sensed, opportunities must be seized.
The dynamic capabilities framework also recognizes
the challenges associated with inventing business models, and the importance of making investments behind
new technologies. In the dynamic capabilities frame-

work, sustainable advantage comes from honing internal
processes, structures, and procedures to generate and
successfully commercialize innovations, be they technological or organizational. In Five Forces, sustained
profitability comes from hiding behind entry barriers,
or building them if they do not already exist. Market
structure is an important factor in Five Forces. It matters
little in dynamic capabilities.
In any event, PFI does not fit comfortably into Five
Forces. The “positioning” that matters in PFI relate to
complementary asset ownership and the appropriability regime. The strategic decisions that matter most are
around the business model, and the timing of investments
in relationship to the emergence of the dominant design
and/or industry standards. Most of these issues cannot
be comfortably embedded within the Five Forces Framework.
Yet PFI does not explain how to continuously build
and maintain durable competitive advantage. It does
not pretend to, except implicitly. An enterprise that can
profit from innovation can of course afford to reinvest, not just in commercialization, but in further invention and discovery. The dynamic capabilities framework explores these issues at the enterprise level, not
just at the level of the individual innovation as does
PFI.
The dynamic capabilities framework recognizes three
analytical separate functions, which must be performed
at the enterprise level to sustain success: sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring. PFI is mainly about the second
activity – seizing – and it provides decision rules for how
entrepreneurs can act to seize the moment, so to speak.
However, it is only by attending to the other elements
of dynamic capabilities that management can hope to
build sustainable advantage. Thus, one can think of PFI
as framing strategic decisions just around commercializing innovation. PFI does not ask how firms develop
new potentially marketable products and services, or
how an enterprise “selects” opportunities for additional
investment, or how it renews itself and both adapts to
and shapes its environment so as to sustain its ability
to deliver value to clients and earn its cost of capital.
However, PFI does address one of the central issues in
dynamic capabilities—namely, how to strategize around
commercialization. It is also purports to predict outcomes.
PFI is part Penrosian, and part Schumpeterian. It is
Penrosian in the sense that the distribution of profits from
innovation is in part a function of the (complementary)
assets/resources and the intellectual property assets (e.g.
patents) that the innovating firm may possess. However,
it is part Schumpeterian in that it advises management as

<-----Page 14----->D.J. Teece / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1131–1146

to which asset the firm should “nail down”, or contract for
access, or just build. There is an implied asset orchestration function, which is entrepreneurial in nature, whether
it is performed by an entrepreneur, or by a manager of
an established enterprise acting purposefully to redesign
the value chain.
7. Public policy
PFI does explore certain public policy issues. In particular, it explores how international commercial policy,
by closing off access to complementary assets, can limit
the ability of innovators to garner profits from innovation. With respect to intellectual property, the framework
highlights mechanisms by which innovators can strategize so as to reduce deficiencies in intellectual property
protection.
PFI does not make a case for either stronger or weaker
intellectual property protection. However, it does indicate how small firms without significant intellectual
property and without complementary assets are challenged in garnering profits from innovation. Moreover,
PFI is a robust framework for helping to explain why
small firms and individual entrepreneurs are likely to
be champions of strong intellectual property, while certain large firms may well be indifferent or possibly even
opposed to intellectual property protection. This is in part
because larger firms are likely to have a broader menu of
alternative strategies for capturing value from their own
and other’s innovations.
To the extent that an efficient market for (trading)
know-how is considered desirable, the PFI framework
does suggest that intellectual property rights are likely
to assist. However, for the system to be efficient, property
right should have clear boundaries (Teece, 2000). Ambiguity only leads to disputes and high transaction costs
that impede transactions in the market for know-how.
In particular, efforts to reduce ambiguity and enhance
clarity, particularly around patent boundaries, will likely
stimulate transactions in the market for know-how and
enable the viability of a richer array of organizational
forms, such as fabless semiconductor technology developers.
There is also clear relevance for antitrust policy.
Unfortunately, a critical cospecialized asset in PFI can
be an “essential facility” in the hands of the plaintiffs
(antitrust) bar—so essential that the regulator might
compel public access. However, it is rarely the case
that owning a cospecialized asset is likely to be synonymous with controlling a relevant antitrust market,
so that mandating access is unlikely to be good public
policy.

1145

8. Conclusion
PFI remains a nascent framework for understanding
outcomes from investment in innovation, and the role of
strategy and organization in that process. It also offers
key building blocks for a Schumpeterian theory of the
firm. I do hope that in the next two decades those challenges are more fully accepted by scholars interested in
the critical economic and business issues of our times.
