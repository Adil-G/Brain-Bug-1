BETWEEN TRUST AND CONTROL:
DEVELOPING CONFIDENCE IN PARTNER
COOPERATION IN ALLIANCES

Strategic alliances have been recognized as arenas with potential for opportunistic
behavior by partners. Hence, a firm needs to have an adequate level of confidence in
its partner's cooperative behavior. In this article we examine the notion of confidence
in partner cooperation in alliances and suggest that it comes from two distinct
sources: trust and control. We make the argument that trust and control are parallel
concepts and that their relationship is of a supplementary character in generating
confidence. In addition, we suggest that control mechanisms have an impact on trust
level and that the trust level moderates the effect of control mechanisms in determining the control level. Finally, we discuss various ways to build trust within strategic
alliances and important alliance control mechanisms.

Strategic alliances are interfirm cooperative
arrangements aimed at achieving the strategic
objectives of the partners. Joint ventures, minority equity stake, coproduction and joint research
and development are just some forms of strategic alliances. Because strategic alliances essentially involve coordinating two or more partners
to pursue shared objectives, satisfactory cooperation is vital to their success (Doz, 1996; Kanter,
1994). Scholars often cite a lack of cooperation
and the opportunistic behavior of partners as
causes for the relatively high rate of failure of
alliances. Given that it is often impossible to
identify who is likely to act opportunistically,
the interesting question is what enables alliance partners to garner enough confidence in
partner cooperation so that they are not overwhelmed by the potential hazards in alliances.
A low level of confidence not only discourages
the formation of a strategic alliance but also
leads partners to view each other with suspicion—with obvious deleterious effects on their
working relationship—if an alliance is formed.
However, researchers have not given this
notion of confidence in partner cooperation
adequate recognition as a significant concept
in the field of strategic alliances. Our purpose
here is to discuss this concept, identify its
sources, and suggest ways for developing it in

strategic alliances. We define confidence in
partner cooperation as a firm's perceived level
of certainty that its partner firm will pursue
mutually compatible interests in the alliance,
rather than act opportunistically. We also argue that the sense of confidence comes from
two distinct sources: trust and control. In that
context we discuss the implicitly complementary relationship between trust and control
found in the literature and make the basic
point that the two concepts should be considered in parallel so that they may supplement
each other in special ways—not merely in the
restricted sense of being complementary to
each other. This opens up the important issue
of a deliberate building of trust and more effective control mechanisms as two distinct avenues that can (and should) be pursued simultaneously for generating confidence in partner
cooperation.
We divide the article into six parts. First, we
discuss the concepts of partner cooperation and
confidence in partner cooperation. Second, we
examine how the two concepts of trust and control operate in a parallel fashion to generate
confidence in partner cooperation. In the third
section we examine the role of trust, control, and
confidence level in different types of alliances.
In the fourth section we further explore the complexities of the trust-control relationship and
discuss the impact of control mechanisms on
trust level, as well as the role played by trust

level in moderating the effectiveness of control
mechanisms in determining the control level.
Fifth, we present several ways in which trust
building can be accomplished in alliances. Finally, we suggest various control mechanisms
for developing confidence in alliance partner
cooperation.

CONFIDENCE IN ALLIANCE PARTNER
COOPERATION
Partner Cooperation
As the term suggests, "strategic alliances" involve allying two or more partner firms. The key
features setting strategic alliances apart from
other single-firm strategies are the element of
interfirm cooperation (Arino, 1997; Buckley &
Casson, 1988; Doz, 1996; Teece, 1992) and the
uncertainty, which has been called "relational
risk" {Das & Teng, 1996), about the presence of
such desired cooperation. We define partner cooperation as (he willingness of a partner firm to
pursue mutually compatible interests in the alliance rather than act opportunistically. Some
theorists believe that "cooperation is obviously
superior to individual action at achieving virtually all goals" {Maitland, Bryson, & Van de Ven,
1985: 59). Opportunism, defined as "self-interest
seeking with guile" {Williamson, 1975: 9), can be
seen as the opposite of partner cooperation in
strategic alliances.
Whereas opportunistic behavior in alliances
is exemplified by cheating, shirking, distorting
information, misleading partners, providing
substandard products/services, and appropriating partners' critical resources, partner cooperation is characterized by honest dealing, commitment, fair play, a n d complying with
agreements. Arino (1997) suggests that cooperation may include two particular dimensions:
(1) veracity {i.e., being truthful) and {2) commitment {i.e., making efforts). Partner cooperation
should not be assumed to exist in all strategic
alliances. Although it seems desirable to have
mutual forbearance, too often alliance partners
are caught in infighting, a s each of them attempts to get ahead in a manner that hurts partner firms {Hamel, Doz, & Prahalad, 1989).
Partner cooperation in strategic alliances is a
significant concept because it represents a
somewhat paradoxical situation: firms are supposed to pursue their own interests, but they are

July

simultaneously required to restrain this natural
pursuit in order to make alliances work. Thus,
the key is to strike a balance between competition and cooperation {Teece, 1992). Although
strategic alliances may be a mutually beneficial
strategy when both markets and hierarchies are
inefficient, the essentially fickle and tentative
nature of partner cooperation should not be
overlooked.
Because of this, some authors have suggested that strategic alliances may be fundamentally self-defeating, unstable, and transitional in nature {Das & Teng, 1997b; Inkpen &
Beamish, 1997; Kogut, 1989; Williamson, 1985).
After all, if cooperation and competition are at
odds with each other, one cannot take for
granted that a satisfactory level of cooperation will be sustained in alliances {Das &
Teng, 1997a; Koot, 1988; Park & Russo, 1996). As
Parkhe h a s noted, opportunistic behaviors are
"individually rational yet produce a collectively suboptimal outcome" {1993: 794). In sum,
it seems that partner cooperation, although
desirable for the effectiveness of alliances,
may not be easy to come by. The question,
then, is how this issue of ensuring satisfactory
cooperation is reflected in firms' perceptions
and consequent conduct in strategic alliances.

Confidence in Partner Cooperation
In our view, this need for satisfactory partner
cooperation means that a firm has to have sufficient confidence in partner cooperation for alliances to work. We define conHdence in partner
cooperation as a firm's perceived certainty
about satisfactory partner cooperation. We must
note that the concept is about a firm's expectations about its partner's behavior only; it has
little to do with its own conduct in the alliance.
The assumption is that, regardless of its own
hidden agendas in an alliance, a firm will be
concerned about its partner firm's opportunistic
behavior.
This definition underscores the uncertainty
aspect of partner cooperation. Because the concept is linked to perceived probability and uncertainty of a partner's behavior, it suggests the
need for reducing the level of uncertainty by
increasing the predictability of satisfactory cooperative behavior. Hence, we see the role of
control level, in addition to trust level, in engendering confidence in partner cooperation. In the

<-----Page 2----->1998

Das and Teng

next section we discuss these two concepts of
control and trust as they relate to our proposed
concept of confidence in partner cooperation, as
well as the relationship between control and
trust. We also clarify how this confidence in
partner cooperation differs from the concept of
trust, in both its essence and in terms of its role
in the dynamics of strategic alliances.
Authors in the alliance literature thus far have
not paid adequate attention to the concept of
confidence in partner cooperation—a concept
we believe has important implications for the
alliance-making process. A lack of confidence in
partner cooperation may well abort a potential
alliance. Given the possibility of losses from an
ill-considered alliance {such as unintended
knowledge transfer and cover for subsequent
acquisition), confidence in partner cooperation
is essential to justify this otherwise highly risky
strategy. It can be reasonably argued that, everything else being equal, firms with a high
level of confidence in partner cooperation will
be more willing to join an alliance. Confidence
in partner cooperation is essential, but far from
automatic. So what are the sources of this confidence? The literature does suggest two key
sources—that is, trust and control—but the relationship between them needs clarification. In
the following section we briefly review this literature and suggest that trust and control operate in a parallel fashion, supplementing each
other as the key sources of partner cooperation.

SOURCES OF CONFIDENCE IN PARTNER
COOPERATION
The Control Perspective

The extant literature suggests that control is a
key source of confidence in partner cooperation.
Firms in alliances tend to be more confident
about partner cooperation when they feel they
have an adequate level of control over their
partners {Beamish, 1988; Sohn, 1994). Control is
an important concept in management; some
consider it, essentially, a cybernetic process.
Others, however, have adopted broader perspectives, treating control as any process in
which one party affects the behavior of others.
Authors have used a variety of terms in the
literature on the control paradigm, such as "level of control," "mode of control," "controlling,"
"control mechanisms," and "control systems"

493

{see Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Das, 1989, 1993;
Flamholtz, Das, & Tsui, 1985; Geringer & Hebert,
1989; Goold & Quinn, 1990; Simons, 1991).
A consequence of all these diverse formulations is that control is referred to simultaneously
as an organizational setup, a process of regulating behaviors, and an organizational outcome.
For the purpose of this article, we consider control as "a regulatory process by which the elements of a system are made more predictable
through the establishment of standards in the
pursuit of some desired objective or state"
(Leifer & Mills, 1996: 117). In addition, control
mechanisms and level of control are two other
important concepts. Whereas control mechanisms are the organizational arrangements designed to determine and influence what organization members will do, level of control is the
direct outcome of the controlling process—that
is, the degree to which one believes that proper
behavior of the other party is ensured.
According to Merchant, "Grood controi means
that an informed person can be reasonably confident that no major, unpleasant surprises will
occur" {1984: 10, emphasis in original). The objective of control mechanisms is to help achieve
an adequate level of control. Clearly, the logic is
that, through the establishment of proper control
mechanisms, the attainment of desirable goals
becomes more predictable. Indeed, the purpose
of control is to fashion activities in accordance
with expectations so that the ultimate goals of
the organization can be attained. Firms may
want to use control mechanisms to either routinize their activities or to promote nonroutine activities, such as learning {Sitkin, Sutcliffe, &
Schroeder, 1994), risk taking, and innovation. Regardless of the focus, firms use control to make
the attainment of organizational goals more predictable, which ensures more certain outcomes,
and it is in this sense that effective control is
believed to help generate a sense of confidence.
Researchers of strategic alliances conform
with this logic and focus on the characteristics
of control mechanisms that enhance the level of
control. Topics of special interest in this area
include the role of ownership control in joint
ventures {Blodgett, 1991; Mjoen & Tallman, 1997)
and contractual control in order to deter opportunistic behavior {Parkhe, 1993; Provan & Skinner, 1989). In this article we focus on partner
control, rather than on alliance control, since
partner control appears to be the direct source of

<-----Page 3----->494

Academy of Management Review

confidence in partner cooperation. Partner control in alliances can be seen as a regulatory
process by which the partner's pursuit of mutually compatible interests is made more predictable.
The Trust Perspective
Besides control, the literature suggests interfirm trust as a second source of confidence in
partner cooperation (Ring & Van de Ven, 1992).
Organizations develop close bonds over time
and form a positive attitude regarding each other's reliability. We need to note here that a certain minimum level of interfirm trust is indispensable for any strategic alliance to be formed
and to function. As Arrow puts it, "Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an
element of trust" (1972: 357), which is certainly
true of any transaction conducted over a period
of time. Because it is impossible to monitor every detail in most exchanges, firms must always
have a minimum level of trust. Trust is especially valuable in alliances because, in varying
degrees, firms have to rely on their partners'
performance and themselves remain vulnerable
to partners' actions (Kumar, 1996).
Scholars have examined interfirm trust in
such areas as supplier relations (Lane & Bachmann, 1996; Moorman, Zaltman, & Deshpande,
1992), joint ventures (Inkpen & Currall, 1997;
Madhok, 1995), and strategic alliances in general (Ring & Van de Ven, 1992; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). The benefits of interfirm trust in
strategic alliances seem wide ranging in character, including lowering transaction costs (Gulati, 1995), inducing desirable behavior (Madhok,
1995), reducing the extent of formal contracts
(Larson, 1992), and facilitating dispute resolution (Ring & Van de Ven, 1994).
The concept of trust is perhaps as diversely
interpreted as the control concept. On the one
hand, scholars have broadly referred to trust as
one's belief and expectation about the likelihood of having a desirable action performed by
the trustee (Deutsch, 1973; Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
On the other hand, some have narrowly defined
it in terms of one's assessment of others' goodwill and reliability (Cummings & Bromiley, 1996;
Ring & Van de Ven, 1992; Sabel, 1993). Those with
a more restrictive approach define trust as "positive expectations about another's motives with
respect to oneself in situations entailing risk"

July

(Boon & Holmes, 1991; 194). We adopt this definition of trust and note that, like most others (e.g.,
Currall & Judge, 1995; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), it regards risk a s the core of trust. It
has been argued that only in risky situations is
trust a relevant factor (Deutsch, 1962; Kee &
Knox, 1970), and to trust essentially means to
take risk and leave oneself vulnerable to the
actions of trusted others (Hosmer, 1995; JohnsonGeorge & Swap, 1982).
Trust is believed to be a source of confidence
because, by definition, trust is the degree to
which the trustor holds a positive attitude toward the trustee's goodwill and reliability in a
risky exchange situation (Gambetta, 1988; Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorderhaven, 1997; Ring & Van
de Ven, 1992), and, as we stated before, confidence in partner cooperation is a firm's perceived certainty that its partner will act in a
responsive manner. Obviously, the more the
trustor believes in the goodwill and reliability of
the trustee, the more confidence in cooperation
he or she will harbor. As Luhmann (1979) has
observed, trust is used to reduce the complexity
of the events and gain positive expectations.
Lane and Bachmann (1996) also have noted that
trust is instrumental in reducing uncertainty,
which is in line with our notion of confidence.
Just as control mechanisms are meant to enhance the probability of having the desired behavior, trust also is useful in enhancing the perceived probability of desired behavior.
At this point, we believe it useful to clarify
how the concept of confidence in partner cooperation is distinct from the concept of trust. First,
we need to note that trust relates to expectations
about the motives of the trustee. Confidence,
however, deals with the perceived level oi certainty that the partner will behave in a desirable manner. Thus, the key difference is that
whereas trust refers to expectations about positive motives, confidence refers to certainty about
cooperative behaviors.
Second, whereas trust is a contributor to confidence in partner cooperation—along with control—confidence, in terms of certainty of partner
cooperation, cannot be equated with trust,
which is merely about positive expectations
about partner motives. Since trust and control
are the two contributory factors of confidence in
partner cooperation, either one by itself is insufficient to explain this confidence. Regarding
confidence as the same as trust negates the role

<-----Page 4----->1998

Das and Teng

of control in partner dynamics. In fact, even with
minimum trust the partners still can develop a
fairly high level of confidence, if adequate control mechanisms are in place.
Third, in terms of the implications of this difference between trust and confidence, while
trust can be developed in specific ways (discussed later), confidence in partner cooperation
can be developed in significant additional ways
through control mechanisms (also discussed in
a later section). In sum, these points demonstrate the nature of the difference between our
proposed concept of confidence in partner cooperation and the concept of trust.
The Trust-Control Relationship
Although both trust and control may be related to confidence in partner cooperation, in no
study have authors systematically examined all
three concepts in an integrated manner. We find
the literature to be unclear and inconclusive
about the relationship between trust and control. Beyond the sense that trust is especially
needed when the trustor has inadequate control
over the trustee (Dasgupta, 1888), there is little
consensus regarding the relationship between
trust and control.
One view is that trust is simply a specific type
of control mechanism. For instance, Bradach
and Eccles (1989) treat trust as a control mechanism that governs economic transactions. However, they use the term "controlling exchanges"
to essentially mean the conduct and facilitation
of transactions, which is different from the concept of control as regulation. As a related matter, some researchers discuss self-control (e.g..
Merchant, 1984) in organizations, which is essentially trust based. In our approach, because
self-control does not involve influencing the behavior of others, it is not really a control mechanism. Sohn (1994) argues that social knowledge
can be viewed as a social control mechanism
and has found that it can be a substitute for
formal control mechanisms, such as majority equity ownership in joint ventures. Nevertheless,
social knowledge—that is, the ability to understand and predict others' behavior—is not the
same as trust, which is a sense of goodwill and
reliability. In sum, although some scholars suggest that trust and certain related concepts may
be used as control mechanisms, the argument
appears to be weak, if we adhere to the conven-

495

tional understandings of trust and control discussed here.
In contrast to the above approach, another
point of view is that trust itself is not a control
mechanism but is a substitute for hierarchical
control in organizations (e.g., Aulakh, Kotabe, &
Sahay, 1997; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). Sitkin and Roth (1993) report that organizations often use "legal remedies" as a substitute for trust.
As Leifer and Mills put it, "While trust might be
seen as a reason not to use objective controls,
trust is not, in and of itself, a control mechanism" (1996: 129). Other researchers seem to concur with this conceptualization. Ring and Van de
Ven (1994) discuss the substitutive relationship
between formal legal contract (control) and psychological contract (trust) in interfirm cooperation. Madhok (1995) also argues that managing
opportunism and relying on trust are two alternative approaches in managing joint ventures.
Although not clearly spelled out, the following
logic seems to be implied in this substitutive
conception. Because trust involves a positive attitude about others' motivations, conceptually, it
is not about influencing and affecting others'
behavior but is about believing that others will
perform whatever serves the trustor's best interests, even in the absence of control. Thus, trust
not only cannot be a control mechanism but it
also implies the exclusion of deliberate control
over the behavior of others. In fact, to trust and
to control seem to be two completely different
kinds of approaches. When it is possible to fully
trust a partner, there is no need to control its
behavior. Control comes into play only when
adequate trust is not present. For instance, if a
manager trusts employees to be self-motivated
to do the best job possible, no behavior or outcome control will be needed.
Looking at it another way, the reason scholars
may view trust and control as substitutes for one
another is that they both contribute to something in common, and we believe that this is
confidence in partner cooperation. Since both
trust and control are instrumental in achieving a
high level of confidence (see our earlier discussion), we suggest that they contribute jointly to
the total level of confidence one has in partner
cooperation.
Although many researchers have treated trust
and control as substitutes, an implicit assumption in the literature is that there is a complementary relationship between the two—that is,

<-----Page 5----->496

Academy ol Management Review

the more there is of trust, the less there is of
control, and vice versa (e.g., Inkpen & Currall,
1997; Leifer & Mills, 1996). We believe that this
restrictive complementary relationship needs
reassessment, because an open-ended supplementary one would more appropriately capture
the nature of trust and control as parallel concepts.
We are aware that a complementary relationship between trust and control is evident in the
literature, in terms of the frequent assertion that
both control mechanisms and trust building are
usually costly for organizations. The selection,
development, and implementation of control
mechanisms, such as budgets, planning systems, and cost-accounting systems can be expensive (Simons, 1991). Trust is not free either;
trust building is a planned activity and takes
considerable resources from organizations over
time. Creed and Miles (1996) have made it explicit that one has to simultaneously consider
costs of control mechanisms, costs of failing to
reach minimal levels of trust, and costs of trust
building. Since both trust and control are costly
to come by and jointly contribute to the level of
confidence, scholars have argued that organizations will not pursue an excessive level of confidence in any given situation. For strategic alliances this means that, to reach a minimum
level of confidence in cooperation, partners can
use trust and control to complement each other
(Beamish, 1988).
Despite the merits of this cost-based argument, a complementary relationship between
trust and control may not be useful in a general sense, because there is no common level
of confidence that is minimally acceptable to
everybody. Partner firms will demand different confidence levels that they feel are
needed, and these levels will be affected by a
number of factors, including partner firms' risk
propensity (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin &
Weingart, 1995), the type of knowledge involved (Chesbrough & Teece, 1996), the
amount of resources committed (Blodgett,
1991), the objective in the alliance (Bleeke &
Ernst, 1995), and the type of alliance (see the
next section). Thus, the level of trust and the
level of control may not be related in a strictly
inverse manner, if the confidence level fluctuates from partner to partner and from case to
case. In fact, Inkpen and Currall (1997) hypoth-

July

esize such an inverse relationship in their
study of joint ventures and find no support for it.
A supplementary relationship, by comparison,
seems to describe the dynamics more realistically. That is, the trust level and the control level
jointly and independently contribute to the level
of confidence in partner cooperation, which may
vary greatly for different partner firms. The key
question here is whether the confidence level
should be viewed as given and static. We believe it is not a zero-sum calculus, in which trust
and control contribute to a specific level of confidence. In the supplementary conception we are
suggesting, a higher trust level does not automatically dictate a lowering of the control level,
and vice versa. All it means is more confidence
in partner cooperation predicated upon certain
levels of trust and control functioning as parallel phenomena.
A firm would be free to build more trust without being required to reduce controls. If the firm
deems it necessary to have a higher level of
confidence in partner cooperation, it may pursue
changing both trust and control simultaneously
and in a parallel fashion, without any zero-sum
complementarity constraints linking trust and
control. This means that the two can be employed simultaneously, in full awareness of the
role and efficacy of each other.
In sum, we can see how the trust level and the
control level have a supplementary relationship
and how they have a joint effect on a firm's
confidence in partner cooperation in a strategic
alliance (see Figure 1). Hence:
Proposition 1: The aggregated level of
trust and control will determine a
firm's confidence in partner cooperation.

TRUST AND CONTROL IN DIFFERENT
ALLIANCE TYPES

We have so far discussed the supplementary
relationship between trust and control and
how this supplementarity is useful when considering the level of confidence in partner cooperation from case to case. One critical contingency seems to be alliance types. That is,
strategic alliances are a variegated phenomenon, and their internal differences should not
be overlooked in theory-building efforts

(Oliver, 1990; Stafford, 1994). Variances in alliance structural configurations may have important implications for our examination of
trust, control, and confidence level relating to
strategic alliances. In this section we discuss
these contingent relationships and their integration.
Scholars often differentiate between equity
and nonequity alliances (Das & Teng, 1996;
Osborn & Baughn, 1990), and the difference is
whether the alliance agreements include equity creation or equity exchange. Some researchers (e.g.. Killing, 1988; Yoshino & Rangan, 1995) have identified three major alliance
structures: (1) joint ventures (JVs), (2) minority
equity alliances, and (3) nontraditional contracts (or nonequity alliances). JVs are independently incorporated entities that are separated from, but jointly run by, parent firms.
Whereas minority equity alliances involve one
party taking an equity stake in its partner (or
equity swap), nonequity alliances are contractual agreements without any equity arrangements. Both of the latter types may have a
variety of configurations, including, but not
limited to, joint R&D, joint production, joint
marketing, supplier partnerships, and licensing agreements. In this article we adopt the
three-part typology and examine how the different alliance structures are related to trust,
control, and confidence level (see Table 1).

Object of Control
JVs are separate from parent firms and usually have their own boards of directors and organizational hierarchy. For JVs one object of
control is the JV per se—that is, the parent company determines what should or should not be
done by the JV. Schaan defines control in JVs as
"the process through which a parent company
ensures that the way a JV is managed conforms
to its own interest" (1983: 57). Because JVs operate independently of parent firms, scholars emphasize the need to treat JVs as separate organizations, so controlling JVs is more or less like
controlling a subsidiary (Geringer & Hebert,
1989; Harrigan & Newman, 1990). Less attention
is given to the fact that control in JVs is not only
about regulating what the JV may do but also
controlling what the partners may do (Bleeke &
Ernst, 1991; Kogut, 1989). In fact, partners often
use JVs as a cover to learn the other firms' knowhow (Hamel, 1991; Hennart & Reddy, 1997). In this
sense, control in JVs may be more complicated
than we think, since the object of control includes both the JV per se and the partner firms.
In contrast, minority equity alliances and nonequity alliances do not involve the creation of
separate entities. Partner firms simply work
jointly, in accord with their agreement. Thus, the
object of control in these two types of alliances
is the partner only. In other words, the purpose

Type of Control
Since JVs are separate entities jointly owned
by two or more partners, the type of control used
in JVs includes both hierarchical and ownership
control (Aulakh et a l , 1997). On the one hand,
hierarchical control refers to the type of control
used within organizations. It is based on authority and involves giving orders to subordinates
and then evaluating their performance. Staffing,
reporting structure, meetings, policies, and procedures are a few examples of hierarchical control. For instance, when a partner exercises control by appointing its executive as the general
manager of a IV, the general manager relies on
hierarchical control to get the job done.
On the other hand, controlling JVs also involves ownership because the JV is jointly
owned. Researchers have focused on the role of
ownership control in JVs (see Geringer & Hebert,
1989). One view expressed is that equity ownership is the ultimate means of control, owing to
the fact that more equity shares give a partner
more voting power (Blodgett, 1991). The opposite
view is that control is not "a strict and automatic
consequence of ownership" (Geringer & Hebert,
1989: 238), so ownership plays only a limited role
in providing control in JVs (Heide & John, 1992).
In our view, since both hierarchical and ownership control are useful in controlling JVs, the
finding that control level is not equivalent to
one's equity share in JV is only to be expected
(Mjoen & Tallman, 1997).
Unlike in JVs, partners in minority equity alliances often rely on ownership control, for equity

Contractual control

ownership is the glue that binds the partner
firms. Hierarchical control is not pertinent here,
because there is no separate entity, and one
partner cannot exercise hierarchical control
over the other. Since one or more firms may be
cross-held by their partners, the means of equity
ownership becomes the more prominent one
(Das & Teng, 1998a). Thus, the percentage of
minority position held by the partner firms (i.e.,
whether it is 1 percent or 49 percent) strongly
influences how much say (or control) each partner has in the alliance (Sohn, 1994).
In contrast, nonequity alliances do not involve
any equity arrangement, so neither hierarchical
nor ownership control is possible. Nonequity alliances, such as licensing agreements and
supplier agreements, essentially are contract
based, in the sense that these contracts are less
open ended than those of JVs. Thus, contractual
control becomes especially important in governing the partnership. Without shared equity ownership, it is difficult to align the interests of
potential partners. Thus, partner firms use contractual rigidity to make sure that contingencies
are covered and opportunism is deterred.
Manifestation of Trust
Since trust and control are parallel concepts,
the manifestation of trust among partners in
strategic alliances is tied to the type of control
they use. Essentially, for a given confidence
level, the development of trust is the opposite of
the tightening up of control. Thus, trust in JVs is
manifested in the grant of more autonomy and
delegation to the JV (Lyles & Reger, 1993). Since
JVs are separate entities, trust in the partner's
goodwill and reliability ultimately leads to the

<-----Page 8----->1998

Das and Teng

belief that the JV will comply with the parent
firm's best interests. Thus, more discretion and
decision-making autonomy will be granted—
both to the JV and to the partner—in managing
the entity.
As we noted above, ownership position plays
an important role in minority equity alliances.
Thus, the use of equity share is a manifestation
of the level of trust between the partners. Although scholars often highlight the controlling
function of equity share (Blodgett, 1991; Lecraw,
1984), in relationships characterized by interfirm
trust, the function of equity share may become
purely a distribution mechanism. In such circumstances, partners use shared ownership as
a guide for allocating residuals, rather than for
merely determining the voting power among
themselves.
Finally, trust among partner firms in nonequity alliances often is manifested in contractual
flexibility. Nonequity alliances are also called
"nontraditional contracts," since they rely more
on explicit contracts compared to other types of
alliances, and "relational contracting," because
the existence of trust makes incomplete contracts conceivable (Borch, 1994; Macneil, 1980).
When partners trust each other, they are in a
better position to appreciate the benefits of contractual flexibility, which include faster response and more efficient environmental and
interfirm adaptation.
Requisite Confidence Level
Various types of alliances may require different levels of confidence in partner cooperation.
First of all, some types of alliances require much
more alliance-specific investments than other
types (Joskow, 1987). Alliance-specific investments often are nonrecoverable investments,
since they represent the amount of resources
committed to the alliance that cannot be fully
recovered if there is an unplanned alliance dissolution. The more alliance specific the investments, the more risk there is for partner firms.
Thus, a higher level of alliance-specific investments demands a higher level of confidence in
cooperation, which helps assuage the partners'
concerns about alliance performance. In other
words, partners need more certainty about cooperation in order to commit substantially to an
alliance. Among the three types of alliances, JVs
clearly require the highest level of alliance-

499

specific investments, since a separate entity
needs to be set up. By comparison, the need for
alliance-specific investments tends to be relatively low in nonequity alliances. For example,
in licensing agreements the licensor provides
patents and/or know-how to the licensee for a
fee, so there is little nonrecoverable investment
involved on the part of licensor.
The second reason that needed confidence
level may differ is that the level of embeddedness varies across alliance types (Osborn &
Baughn, 1990). Embeddedness refers to the degree of mutual dependence and connectedness
among the exchange parties (Granovetter, 1985;
Provan, 1993). Interfirm embeddedness contributes to the formation of strategic alliances, for
firms in social networks need each other more
than what regular business contracts can accommodate. More importantly, strategic alliances, in turn, also raise the level of interfirm
embeddedness (Proven, 1993), because the partner firms cannot freely exit the relationship. In
this sense interfirm embeddedness is tantamount to exit barriers in alliances. It is apparent
that JVs invite a high degree of interfirm embeddedness, whereas partner firms in nonequity alliances are least embedded. That is, licensing
agreements can be terminated without much
complication, whereas the dissolution of JVs and
minority equity alliances involves equity relinquishment. Thus, only if partner firms have a
fairly high level of confidence in partner cooperation will they be willing to enter into a JV.
Finally, apart from the initial nonrecoverable
investment, potential harm (or down-side risk)
because of opportunistic behavior also differs
greatly from one type of alliance to another.
Strategic alliances are often noted for being a
fertile arena for unintended resource transfer,
especially technological and managerial knowhow (Hamel, 1991). Partner firms often use alliances as a cover for appropriating firm-specific
resources (Inkpen & Beamish, 1997). Thus, partner firms are exposed to the risk of losing competitive advantage through ill-suited alliances.
Among the three alliance types, JVs are potentially the most susceptible to the unintended
transfer of knowledge and know-how, as partners work closely in a single organization (Hennart & Reddy, 1997; Mowery, Oxley, & Silverman,
1996). By comparison, in minority equity alliances and nonequity alliances, partner firms often carry out their part of responsibilities sepa-

<-----Page 9----->luly

Academy ol Management Beview

500

rately (i.e., more contract based), thus reducing
the scope and possible impacts of opportunistic
behavior. Again, a higher degree of confidence
in cooperation is demanded for JVs since this
structure is the most conducive of the three for
opportunism.
In sum, since JVs come with more alliancespecific investments, a higher level of interfirm
embeddedness, and more possibilities for opportunistic resource transfer, a high level of confidence in partner cooperation is essential. By
the same token, nonequity alliances demand
only a relatively low level of confidence, and
minority equity alliances a moderate level.
We can also examine requisite confidence
levels in terms of how trust and control jointly
contribute to the confidence level in partner cooperation. This additive relationship has different implications for the three types of alliances,
as we represent in summary fashion in Table 2.
Both the trust level and the control level have
been dichotomized into high and low values, in
order to explore these differences in terms of
four categories of confidence.
When both the trust level and the control level
are high, the firm will have high confidence in
partner cooperation. In alliances high confidence is generated when mutually trusting partners negotiate substantive control mechanisms
to ensure cooperation. This high-high situation
is most likely to exist for JVs, since they demand
a high level of confidence. Partners entering into
a JV, irrespective of their previous good relationship, are known to devote considerable time and
effort in developing elaborate control mechanisms, such as frequent meetings between the
partners, periodic written reports of all relevant

transactions, and so on (Geringer & Hebert, 1989;
Parkhe, 1993).
Along similar lines, a low-low situation will
lead to low confidence in partner cooperation;
this is most appropriate for nonequity alliances,
such as licensing arrangements and supplier
partnerships. Low confidence is present when
partners have limited trust in each other and
limited ability to influence each other's behavior.
As to the low-trust, high-control situation, the
resulting confidence category may be labeled
"moderate." Partners establish the essentially
control-based confidence mainly through stringent regulations and common norms, rather
than on the basis of perceived goodwill and
reliability. Although the trust level may be low,
sufficient technical rules are provided to foster a
moderate level of confidence in partner cooperation. By the same token, the high-trust, lowcontrol situation also leads to moderate confidence, based mainly on a sense of positive
expectations of partners' motives. Since both
these situations reflect a moderate confidence
level, minority equity alliances are the most
likely structural choice under these two circumstances.
TRUST LEVEL, CONTROL MECHANISMS, AND
CONTROL LEVEL

Although, as mentioned earlier, we regard
trust and control as parallel sources of confidence in partner cooperation, our conceptualization does not suggest that trust and control are
completely noninteracting concepts. In fact, we
believe that control mechanisms may have

some direct impact on the trust level and that
trust level plays a moderating role between control mechanisms and control level (see Figure 1).
Effect of Control Mechanisms on Trust Level
We have noted that control mechanisms are
organizational arrangements intended to enhance the level of control. The relationship between control mechanisms and trust is far from
clear in the literature. In essence, the dispute is
about whether the deployment of control mechanisms damages trust among exchange members. Argyris (1952) notes that control mechanisms imply that one party does not trust the
other. Since trust has the characteristic of reciprocity, one tends to think along the lines of "I do
not trust because you do not trust." Consequently, this may evolve into a vicious cycle,
tending toward trust dissolution. Following this
logic, control mechanisms will undermine the
trust level in strategic alliances.
Nevertheless, those holding the contrary viewpoint maintain that control mechanisms, if used
properly, may help build mutual trust (Goold &
Campbell, 1987). The basic argument here is that,
because control mechanisms provide a "track
record" for those who perform well, trust between
the parties may eventually be nurtured and
strengthened. Thus, a track record and an objective evaluation process are more conducive for
generating trust than a subjective evaluation process. Furthermore, Sitkin suggests that legalization, in terms of "reliance on formal rules and
standardized procedures" (1995: 189), can facilitate
"the development, diffusion, and constructive institutionalization of trust in organizational settings" (1995: 187). Goold and Quinn (1990) also note
that control mechanisms may not always militate
against the development of trust.
Apparently, this dispute about the effect of
control mechanisms on trust level has important
implications for strategic alliances. Although
we agree that control mechanisms do not necessarily undermine trust, we believe there
needs to be a more refined and contingent approach. Ouchi (1979) differentiates outcome, behavior, and clan (or social) control mechanisms.
Formal control includes outcome control and behavior (or process) control, which measures,
evaluates, and rewards either outcomes or behaviors. He proposes that the optimal choice of
control mechanisms is determined by task char-

501

acteristics (i.e., outcome measurability and task
programmability). Thus, there needs to be a fit
between task characteristics and the control
mechanisms employed. More recently, some
have suggested that agency theory variables
(behavior observability and outcome uncertainty) are also critical in this choice (Eisenhardt, 1985; Kirsch, 1998).
Hence, one type of contingency is that a lack
of fit between the situation and the choice of
control mechanisms leads to an erosion of trust.
Another type of contingency, which we explore
in this article, is when different effects on trust
stem directly from different control mechanisms.
Aulakh et al. (1997) argue that the three types of
control mechanisms (i.e., output, process, and
social) have different effects on trust in partnership. According to their hypothesis, output control is negatively related to trust level, whereas
process and social control are positively related
to trust level. However, they found empirical
support only for a positive relationship between
social control and trust level.
In our view it is necessary to consider formal
control and social control for their distinctive
implications for trust. Whereas formal control
employs codified rules, goals, procedures, and
regulations that specify desirable patterns of
behavior, social control utilizes organizational
values, norms, and cultures to encourage desirable behavior. The key difference is that formal
control is more of a strict evaluation of performance while social control is about dealing
with people. Thus, formal controls may create
stress, thereby affecting mutual trust.
Formal control serves to influence people's behavior patterns by delineating clear boundaries.
Whether the target of control is prescribing specific performance goals (output control) or specific
processes (behavior control), the implication is
that one cannot have full autonomy in deciding
what is best for the organization. This reservation
often suggests a lack of belief in one's goodwill,
reliability, or competence. Sitkin and Roth (1993)
report limited effectiveness of legalistic remedies
(i.e., formal rules and contracts) for building trust.
Hence, it appears that the nature of formal controls is at odds with a trusting environment, which
suggests a negative relationship between formal
control and trust level.
This is also the case with strategic alliances.
When extensive contractual safeguards, such as
lawsuit provisions, are featured, a sense of sus-

<-----Page 11----->502

Academy of Management Review

picion rather than trust tends to dominate the
relationship. Each alliance has a contract, but
the difference is in terms of the degree to which
process and conduct are specified. In their study
of international JVs, CuUen, Johnson, and Sakano (1995) found no support that formal control
led to more commitment in alliances. Also, Sitkin and Stickel found that formal control systems "can lead to escalating distrust if they are
ill-suited to the task at hand" (1996: 209). Of
course, this does not mean that nothing can be
done about formal control to help build trust. For
instance, Mayer and Davis (1996) report that replacement of an appraisal system with a more
valid one increases the level of trust. The implication is that poorly designed formal control
mechanisms can undermine trust.
In contrast to formal control, social control relies
on normative considerations to influence others'
behavior. Social control is about inducing desirable behavior through "soft" measures, so it is
associated more with such terms as "informal control," "normative control," and "clan control" (Leifer & Mills, 1996). The underlying assumption of
social control is that people can ultimately determine their own behavior. Influence comes only in
the form of shared goals, values, and norms. Since
there is no explicit restriction on members' behavior, more interpersonal respect and less mistrust
are implied in social control than in formal control. As such, social control is manifested in a
certain level of confidence in members' judgment
and competence, which lays the foundation for
trust (Larson, 1992).
Like trust building, social control tends to take
a long-term orientation toward a relationship,
for cultural systems and norms are nurtured
only slowly. Although this characteristic does
not rule out the use of social control in more
short-lived alliances, it is more likely to be effective in more long-term arrangements, such as
JVs. Social control in alliances often takes the
form of socialization, interaction, and training.
Some natural by-products of socialization and
interaction are better understanding and shared
values, which then lead to interfirm trust (Creed
& Miles, 1996; Madhok, 1995). Moreover, social
control often provides a supportive environment
for partner firms to understand the process and
objective of alliance management, which is often ambivalent at the beginning (Doz, 1996).
Thus, considerable overlaps exist between social control mechanisms and trust building. Fi-

July

nally, as we mentioned, scholars have found
empirical support for a positive relationship between social control and trust level (Aulakh et
al., 1997). In summary, we propose the following:

Proposifion 2a: The deployment of formal control mechanisms will undermine the level of trust among partners.
Proposition 2b: The deployment of social control mechanisms will enhance
the level of trust among partners.
Trust Level As a Moderator Between Control
Mechanisms and Control Level
Regarding the relationship between control
mechanisms and actual control level, we cannot
take for granted the direction of causality. Merchant notes that "more controls [control mechanisms] do not necessarily give more control, but
the reasons why this occurs are not clear" (1984:
2). Thus far, scholars suggest that a number of
unintended negative consequences result from
implementing control mechanisms, which may,
in turn, hamper effective control (Goold &
Quinn, 1990). Major side effects from controlling
include behavioral displacement, gamesmanship, operating delays, and negative attitudes
(Merchant, 1984). Since these side effects are
dysfunctional for achieving the ultimate purpose of the organization, partners do not automatically achieve effective control by implementing control mechanisms.
Apparently, we still do not know enough
about the relationship between control mechanisms and actual control level. Goold and Quinn
(1990) propose a contingency theory to explore
the effectiveness of control mechanisms, a s
moderated by types of business. Vry2a and Fryxell (1997) also report that interfirm trust moderates the relationship between informal control
and JV performance.
In line with this contingency thinking, we suggest that trust level may be a moderator between control mechanisms and control level in
strategic alliances. According to Goold and
Quinn, "[Tlrust is a prime prerequisite of effective control" (1990: 54), because the implementation of control mechanisms requires a certain
level of trust. Using a similar logic for marketing
partnerships, Heide and John argue that norms
provide the conditions under which effective

<-----Page 12----->Das and Teng
control can be exercised (1992: 36). Without a
minimum level of trust, it is extremely difficult to
agree on goals, to impose rules, and to conduct
teamwork. With the presence of interfirm trust,
control is less likely to backfire, as partners understand each other better and are more willing
to exercise mutual forbearance.
Mohr and Spekman (1994) have noted that trust
induces desirable behavior in alliances, including
more efficiency with conflict resolution. Although
a good level of control requires the presence of
trust, trust per se is unlikely to be a direct attribute
of control (Leifer & Mills, 1996). The reason for this
is that trust as one's own perception about others
does not directly influence others' behavior. Otherwise, trust would be conceptualized as a control
mechanism.
Accordingly, we propose that trust plays a
moderating role between control mechanisms
and control level. When there is a high level of
trust, control mechanisms are more likely to be
effective in generating an adequate level of control. In other words, trust will facilitate the operation of control mechanisms. Thus:
Proposifion 3; In strategic alliances
the trust level will exert a moderating
effect in a manner so fha( control
mechanisms will achieve a greater
level of control in high-trust situations
than in low-trust situations.
TRUST BUILDING IN STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

We noted earlier that the difference between a
complementary view and a supplementary view
of trust and control is not without significance.
Although Creed and Miles (1996) have noted that
trust level is not static in any given relationship,
most researchers have not paid sufficient attention to the fact that trust needs to be developed
in a conscious and gradual manner (Bhide &
Stevenson, 1992). Based on the restrictive notion
of a necessarily complementary relationship between trust and control in alliances, scholars'
emphasis seems to have been on how best to
institute adequate control mechanisms when
trust is not available (Blodgett, 1991; Yan & Gray,
1994). Consequently, not enough thought has
been given to the question of trust building in
alliances, as compared to the attention given to
deploying control mechanisms in lieu of needed
trust. In this section we turn to trust building in
strategic alliances.

503

Many have viewed trust as an essential ingredient in almost all kinds of human relationships,
since it has a smoothing effect on exchanges in
a very efficient way (Arrow, 1972; Deutsch, 1973;
Luhmann, 1979; Williamson, 1993; Zand, 1972).
Thus, psychologists and sociologists have done
extensive studies on how to develop trust
among individuals (Boon & Holmes, 1991;
Gabarro, 1978; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Zucker,
1986). By comparison, the literature does not offer much help in adequately comprehending the
process by which interfirm trust develops. In this
section we present some selected trust-building
techniques in strategic alliances. The more significant techniques include risk taking, equity
preservation, communication, and interfirm adaptation, and they are intended to assist firms in
accumulating information on the basis of which
the trustworthiness of partners can be evaluated. Some of these techniques have been mentioned in the literature but have not been closely
linked with strategic alliances. Thus, our contribution here is in terms of systematically presenting trust-building techniques in the alliance
context.
Trust from Risk Taking
Most theorists would agree that trust is intimately associated with risk and risk taking
(Coleman, 1990) and that trust and risk can be
considered "mirror images" of each other (Das &
Teng, 1998b). Trust and risk taking are believed
to form a reciprocal relationship: trust leads to
risk taking, and risk taking, in turn, buttresses a
sense of trust, given that the expected behavior
materializes (Boon & Holmes, 1991; Madhok,
1995; Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985). When a
trustee realizes that a trustor has taken considerable risk in trusting her, she tends to be motivated to behave in a trustworthy manner.
Such reciprocity has been found to be a key
element in trust building (Johnson, Cullen,
Sakano, & Takenouchi, 1997; Larson, 1992). The
logic is one of "I trust because you trust" (McAllister, 1995) or "trust begets trust" (Creed &
Miles, 1996). Only if some initial risk is taken is
it possible for the trustee to demonstrate his or
her trustworthiness. It is in this sense that
Strickland (1958) suggests that, in order to develop trust, one needs to take risk first—as if the
trustee deserves the trust. Gulati, Khanna, and
Nohria (1994) have argued that because strate-

<-----Page 13----->504

Academy ol Management Review

gic alliances often do not constitute the prisoner's dilemma situation, unilateral commitments
may well be a good strategy. Also, a significant
level of nonrecoverable investment in an alliance signals one's commitment and trust, thus
further boosting the trust level among partners.
Indeed, although strategic alliances are often
motivated by a need to reduce risk in the marketplace, they also invite firms to take relational
risk with their partners.
Although risk taking breeds trust, firms do not
blindly take unjustified risk in the hope of developing a trustful relationship. It is more likely
that a gradual approach is adopted, in which
partners start with limited investments. As options theorists suggest, incremental resource
commitments may be the preferred strategy
when risk and uncertainty levels are high (Bowman & Hurry, 1993). Deeply rooted in historical
engagement, trust is most likely to be the accumulation of prior satisfactory experiences
(Gulati, 1995; Luhmann, 1988). Locating a partner
with a good reputation seems to be an effective
starting point. A firm with a reputation of being
honest, fair, and trustworthy gives one the
needed first piece of evidence to take some initial risk (Barney & Hansen, 1994).
Once a trustworthy partner is found, alliance
partners rely on the trial-and-error approach in
building up interfirm trust. Trust earned from
prior engagement then serves as the evidence to
justify a subsequent risky step beyond the accumulated evidence. Larson (1992) provides case
studies of how a trial period is used among
entrepreneurial firms to build up mutual trust in
an incremental fashion.
Trust from Equity Preservation
Besides risk taking, a second way to build
trust among partners is to ensure that equity
and fairness are mostly preserved (Korsgaard,
Schweiger, & Sapienza, 1995; Sheppard &
Tuchinsky, 1996). In essence, equity means that
the firm contributing the most resources (both
tangible and intangible) to the alliance should
get the most from it. According to the equity
theory of motivation, people have a strong need
to maintain their sense of equity in exchange
relationships (Adams, 1963).
Equity is essential not only for cooperation
within organizations, but also for interfirm cooperation. Kumar (1996) stresses the importance of

distributive and procedural justice in creating
trust in manufacturer-retailer relationships, and
Johnson (1997) reports that perceptions of procedural justice in strategic decision making have
important impacts on partners' commitment to
JVs. Should partners become concerned about
potential inequities in profit distribution, for instance, their confidence in and commitment to
the alliance most likely would recede, even if
the alliances are about to bring positive results.
The reason, as equity theory of motivation suggests, is that people may be preoccupied with
maintaining a fair relationship. An unfair relationship may lead one firm to feel that someone
is taking advantage of it. Ring and Van de Ven
(1994) have stated that, sometimes, partners
view equity as a more important performance
criterion than efficiency. As such, equity is an
important source of trust in alliances, and a lack
of equity may undermine mutual trust significantly.
That said, the relationship between trust and
equity appears to go both ways—that is, a high
level of trust tends to encourage partners to tolerate short-term inequity or mutual forbearance.
Given a certain trust level among partners, it is
also apparent that extended periods or growing
instances of inequity will create tension and
strain existing trust. Therefore, for the sake of
trust building, profit distribution needs to be
kept on an equitable basis.
Trust from Communication
Communication and proactive information exchange form yet another tactic to boost trust
among partners (Macneil, 1980; Thomas &
Trevino, 1993). There may be several reasons
why communication and information processing
play important roles in trust building. First of
all, open and prompt communication among
partners is believed to be an indispensable
characteristic of trusting relationships (Kanter,
1994; Larson, 1992). Without proper communication, cooperative relationships tend to suffer.
Only if the partners can constantly sound off on
their differences, of which there are always
some in any relationship, will they be able to
avoid fatal conflicts. Thus, communication irons
out the potential kinks in daily operations and
makes for a satisfactory working relationship.
Second, firms need to collect evidence about
their partners' credibility and trustworthiness.

<-----Page 14----->1998

Das and Teng

and comniunication facilitates this process.
Creed and Miles (1996) have stressed the importance of being open to the evidence of others'
trustworthiness, but without proactive information exchange, this process would take a long
time. Hart and Saunders have emphasized the
significance of sharing information with partners, which leads to "information symmetry
rather than information asymmetry" {1997: 34).
Firms may deliberately provide unsolicited—
including even somewhat sensitive—information to their partners as a way of showing both
goodwill and intimacy. As the reciprocal process starts to gain credibility, sustained information flow between the partners should create
a trusting environment.
Third, communication helps build trust because it provides the basis for continued interaction, from which partners further develop
common values and norms (Leifer & Mills, 1996).
Madhok (1995) notes that sustained interaction
is a crucial mechanism for holding the partners
together. Through information exchange, partners should identify and develop more commonalities, so a sense of trust would be reinforced.
Trust from Interfirm Adaptation
Trust is earned from partners if one adapts to
the needs of cooperation in partnerships (Heide
& John, 1992). Interfirm adaptation refers to the
adjustment of one's own behavioral pattern in
order to bring about a fit between the partners or
between the alliance and the environment
(Hallen, Johanson, & Seyed-Mohamed, 1991).
Flexibility and the willingness to accommodate
deviations from the contract when necessary are
key to interfirm adaptation. Macneil (1980) has
recognized that a willingness to carry out such
adaptations is essential for trust building, and
Madhok (1995) has proposed that bilateral adaptation in JVs provides incentive for acting for
mutual interests rather than self-interests. Being
flexible enough to respond positively to the
changing needs of a partnership demonstrates
that the firm not only values the alliance but is
also willing to make considerable efforts toward
desirable accommodations.
Sometimes, the nature of an alliance calls for
mutual adaptation—for example, to ease a potential cultural clash (Sankar, Boulton, Davidson, Snyder, & Ussery, 1995) or to make firmspecific investments. At other times interfirm

505

adaptation becomes a necessity because a
changing environment requires modifications in
the way partners cooperate. For example, if the
host country of a JV imposes new laws banning
a majority equity share owned by foreign partners, then the situation calls for both partners to
adapt to the new situation. A willingness to do
this, although possibly painful in economic or
other terms, would earn much trust from the
partner. Hence, making adaptations according
to the needs of the partnership is an effective
way to develop trust.
CONTROL MECHANISMS IN STRATEGIC
ALLIANCES

So far, we have explored various trustbuilding tactics in strategic alliances. We now
discuss specific control mechanisms to develop
confidence in partner cooperation. Control theorists have examined and proposed a number of
control mechanisms, such as cybernetic regulations and information-processing devices. Nevertheless, not all control mechanisms are fully
relevant for strategic alliances. As Sheppard
and Tuchinsky note, in network organizations
"control is not exercised in the form of hierarchical authority" but, rather, in terms of "relationships between relative equals" (1996: 142).
As we mentioned earlier, one key differentiation in the control literature is that between formal control and social control. We maintain that
both formal control and social control can be
used effectively in strategic alliances, and we
discuss the following three specific control
mechanisms that appear to be particularly relevant to strategic alliances: (1) goal setting,
(2) structural specifications, and (3) cultural
blending.
Goal Setting
Goal setting emphasizes the importance of
establishing specific and challenging goals in
organizations (Locke & Latham, 1984). Based on
this idea, management by objectives, as a prominent form of goal setting, has gained acceptance as a management program for enhancing
control and boosting performance. Besides goal
content, the process of setting goals also has
drawn the attention of researchers in recent
years. For the purpose of control in strategic
alliances, partners normally would prefer a high

<-----Page 15----->506

Academy oi Management Review

degree of goal formalizafion. For instance, partners in strategic alliances may pursue eifher
long-term goals or short-term goals. Firms with
a high need for control would prefer alliance
goals of short-term orientation, because performance evaluation and feedback can be monitored more frequently against immediate objectives. However, because explicit goals often are
difficult to formulate in the initial stages of forging alliances, firms would give more attention to
an effective goal-setting process.
Scholars often regard goal setting as critical
in strategic alliances because of the potential
for goal incongruence among partners. Merchant (1984) discusses several dimensions of
goals, including congruence, specificity, communication and internalizafion, and completeness. Authors of the control literature have emphasized that the definition of desired results (or
goals) is an essential part of a control process,
which also includes measurements and reinforcements (Eisenhardt, 1985; Ouchi, 1979). The
logic of a cybernetic process suggests thaf goals
are a prerequisite in control, since there must be
a pre-existing objective against which results
will be evaluated. Formal control becomes very
difficult in the absence of agreed goals. Thus,
ensuring that one's own interests are reflected
in the official goals of the alliance is the starting
point of control (Geringer & Hebert, 1989). Clear
objectives not only help set the direction for the
alliance but also facilitate the establishment of
specific rules and regulations. Goals are important for formal control mechanisms because
they specify what is expected of partners. Although partners may still engage in dysfunctional activities, having clear goals makes it
much easier to identify these activities.
That said, having explicit goals in strategic
alliances is not always possible, or even desirable. Partner firms often cannot agree on goals
for the alliance that will effectively serve their
respective interests. Moreover, given information asymmetry and the presence of hidden
agendas, partner firms often have to tolerate a
certain degree of goal ambiguity. One can even
argue that goal ambiguity and uncertainty
about the future are the very conditions that
prompt firms to consider entering into alliances.
If so, the negative effects of having specific
goals (i.e., sacrificing flexibility) may outweigh
the benefits of better control.

July

Thus, the process of goal setting may become
even more important as a useful social control
mechanism in strategic alliances. Participatory
decision making serves the purpose of controlling, because in the process partners interact
among themselves to gain a better understanding of each other. As a result, collective norms
and values of the alliance are developed. Because the goal-setting process allows partners
to form a consensus gradually, their incentive to
deviate from agreed-upon objectives tends to
be significantly curbed. In this sense, we can
view goal setting as a form of normative control
(Leifer & Mills, 1996; Simon, 1957). In sum, the
goal-setting process is important for both formal
and social control.
Structural Specifications
Structural arrangements, including rules and
regulations, are the heart of formal control. In
strategic alliances formal control tends to be
especially relevant, owing to the relatively high
degrees of goal incongruence and performance
ambiguity. Partners often use a variety of structural specifications to ensure desirable behavior in strategic alliances (Geringer & Hebert,
1989). Parkhe (1993) uses "ex ante deterrents"
and "ex post deterrents" to refer to certain structural arrangements that discourage opportunistic behavior in alliances.
Ex ante deterrents are designed to minimize
partners' incentive for opportunism. They have
been specified as nonrecoverable investments,
which lose much of their value should the alliance fail. Because each partner holds considerable stake, it will be embedded in the alliance
and, hence, will behave more responsibly. Williamson (1983) has recognized that credible commitments partially come from being mutual hostages. Thus, Das and Teng (1996) suggest that
equity alliances, such as JVs and minority equity investment, will be more desirable if controlling opportunistic behavior is the priority. In
line with this view, some theorists have suggested that, in JVs, shared equity ownership,
rather than dominant ownership, may be a more
effective control mechanism (Geringer & Hebert,
1989; Sohn, 1994).
Unlike ex ante deterrents, ex post deterrents
refer to structural safeguards against opportunism in the process of managing alliances. Specific arrangements include reporting and check-

Das and Teng

ing devices, written notice of any departure from
the agreement, accounting examination, cost
control, quality control, arbitration clauses, and
lawsuit provisions. Deciding upon these structural specifications requires partners' investment of considerable energy and time during
the negotiation stage. In case partners cannot
agree on specific structures of the alliances,
they may as well resort to their respective bargaining power (Neale & Bazerman, 1992; Yan &
Gray, 1994). It is equally costly in the operation
stage, since substantial resources and information-processing capacity have to be allocated
just for the purpose of internal control. Nevertheless, rigid structural arrangements do effectively set the boundaries for the behavior of alliance partners.

Cultural Blending
Unlike in formal control, the central element of
social control is organizational culture—"a system of shared values . . . and norms that define
appropriate attitudes and behaviors for organizational members" (O'Reilly & Chatman 1996:
160). Organizational culture provides a sense of
control, for it unifies the way organizational
members process information and react to the
environment, which facilitates the achievement
of a higher level of behavioral predictability
(Trice & Beyer, 1993). Because people are guided
by their shared values and norms, they voluntarily behave in a manner that is desired by
other organizational members as well. Compared to hierarchical organizations, in strategic
alliances the managing of organizational culture presents both a daunting challenge and a
potential opportunity (Sankar et al., 1995).
Managing alliance culture is a challenge because it is about blending and harmonizing two
different organizational cultures (Wilkof, Brown,
& Selsky, 1995). Cultural clash has caused many
mergers/acquisitions to fail, simply because two
companies cannot be pulled together easily and
then expected to work seamlessly as one. Acculturation (or cultural diffusion) in mergers and
acquisitions may take the mode of integration,
assimilation, separation, and deculturation (Nahavandi & Malekzadeh, 1988). Some have suggested that the acquiring firm and the acquired
firm have very different perspectives in deciding upon the acculturation mode, and incongru-

507

ence in partner preference may create acculturation stress resulting in unsuccessful mergers.
A similar form of acculturation stress is likely
to occur in strategic alliances. This issue may
become especially serious for alliances in
which one partner plays a dominant role.
Whereas in a merger/acquisition it is acceptable for one organizational culture to prevail, in
alliances this is rarely so, for partners in alliances are still independent firms so that both
are concerned about losing their own organizational identity in a strategic alliance. Thus, the
challenge is to make cultural blending work,
while largely preserving the separate cultures.
Furthermore, there are certain organizational
cultures that are inherently discordant, such as
the rigid form of large organizations and the
flexible one of small firms.
Despite the difficulties, managing culture is
critical, particularly owing to a lack of alternative effective control mechanisms in alliances.
As we mentioned earlier, goal setting and structural specifications are useful, but the degree of
goal incongruence and task complexity may
well require a higher level of control in alliances. Therefore, to a certain extent, blending
organizational cultures offers an attractive alternative. The key seems to be in the socialization and training of alliance managers. Socialization provides much-needed interaction
among managers from both sides, thus enabling
managers to familiarize themselves with their
partner's organizational culture. Such personal
interaction helps develop common values and
norms for the alliance.
CONCLUDING REMARKS

One of the key questions for partners in strategic alliances is whether to trust or to control.
The major theme here is that trust and control
are two alternative sources in developing confidence in partner cooperation, although the two
are not linked by a simple complementary relationship. In this article we have proposed an
integrated framework of trust and control for
developing a firm's confidence in partner cooperation in strategic alliances.
We first examined, at some length, the notion
of confidence in partner cooperation in a strategic alliance, defined as a firm's perceived certainty about satisfactory partner cooperation.
We also discussed how this notion of confidence

<-----Page 17----->508

Academy of Management Review

in partner cooperation is conceptually different
from trust, which relates to the trustor's positive
expectations about the motives of the trustee.
One distinction, among others, between trust
and confidence is that of expectations of motives as against perceptions of certainty about
cooperative behavior. Since partners recognize
strategic alliances as potential arenas for opportunistic behavior, the significance of confidence in partner cooperation seems clear for the
formation and management of alliances.
Second, we discussed how trust and control
are two distinct sources of confidence in partner
cooperation. After conceptually differentiating
trust and control as two parallel concepts, we
examined them in an integrated manner. Although some theorists have suggested that trust
is itself a control mechanism, we have found the
existing literature to be unclear on this point
and have argued that trust cannot be a control
mechanism, if both trust and control are defined
restrictively for increased clarity. We have defined trust here as a positive expectation about
others' motives, and control as the process of
regulating others' behavior to make it more predictable. The confusion in the literature stems
from authors using the terms, perhaps unwittingly, as if they were causally linked within an
implied complementary straightjacket.
A more appropriate construction of the relationship, we have contended, would be of a supplementary character—flexible and open ended—which would disentangle the tightly
coupled conception of the trust-control relationship evident in the literature, thereby facilitating the consideration of the two concepts on
their own terms. This, of course, recognizes the
possibility of substituting one concept for the
other (given a specific desired level of confidence), but without the obvious limitations of a
strictly complementary relationship between
the two. Such an uncoupled conception of trust
and control in the development of confidence in
partner cooperation enables us to consider the
significant issue of the two concepts interacting
to supplement each other in special ways. That
is, in a particular alliance situation, the two
concepts can be developed in parallel, but with
due regard to their interactive effects should the
need arise for increased confidence in partner
cooperation.
Third, by uncoupling the implied complementary linkage between trust and control that per-

vades the literature, we were able to explore the
relationship between trust level and control
mechanisms, as well as the moderating role of
trust level in control. We suggested that although trust and control are parallel concepts,
they are not completely independent in the
sense of being isolated from each other. In fact,
the deployment of control mechanisms may either enhance or undermine the trust level, depending on the specific type of control mechanisms partners use. Furthermore, we suggested
that trust level plays a moderating role between
control mechanisms and control level. In other
words, we proposed that trust level will facilitate the deployment of control mechanisms,
even though some of these very mechanisms
may be suggestive of a lack of trust.
Fourth, in examining these relationships, we
discussed some of the complexities introduced
by the variety of alliance types. Adopting a contingent approach, we examined three major
types of alliances in terms oi the roles of trust,
control, and confidence level. It appears that,
whereas the basic roles of these constructs we
delineate in this article can be generalized
across alliance types, the specifics of each construct can differ fairly widely because of the
structural differences among strategic alliance
types. For instance, the requisite level oi confidence in partner cooperation appears to be high
in JVs, compared to only a relatively low level
for nonequity alliances.
Fifth, we systematically addressed the issues
of trust building and control mechanisms in
strategic alliances. For trust building in alliances, we discussed four key techniques; (1) risk
taking, (2) equity preservation, (3) communication, and (4) interfirm adaptation. We also discussed three key control mechanisms in strategic alliances: (1) goal setting, (2) structural
specifications, and (3) organizational culture
blending. This discussion should help us to better understand the various alternatives for developing confidence in partner cooperation.
Finally, regarding future research based on
this integrative examination of trust and control
in developing confidence in partner cooperation
in strategic alliances, we see one area that
seems particularly promising (but that we have
not addressed here). Some scholars have suggested that the optimal combination of trust
building and control mechanisms depends on
their respective costs. The conventional wisdom

<-----Page 18----->1998

Das and Teng

is that one should employ control mechanisms
when adequate trust is wanting. The assumption underlying this argument is that trust is
ostensibly something of a static phenomenon. In
fact, as we have tried to show, trust can (and
should) be developed whenever it is deemed
appropriate. However, trust building can be
costly, for considerable organizational resources are necessary, in some form or other.
Thus, we believe it would be of interest to explore the calculus of optimal combinations of
trust and control in developing confidence
through a detailed analysis of the relative costs
oi trust building and control mechanisms. To
that end, our discussion on specific trustbuilding techniques and control mechanisms
should provide a useful starting point.
