A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODEL OF VENTURE GROWTH
J. ROBERT BAUM
EDWIN A. LOCKE
KEN G. SMITH
of
University
Maryland at College Park
We drew upon strategic management theory, organizational behavior theory, organization theory, and entrepreneurship models to form an integrated model of venture
growth including 17 concepts from five micro and macro research domains. The model
was tested with responses from 307 companies from the architectural woodworking
industry. CEOs'specific competencies and motivations and firm competitive strategies
were direct predictors of venture growth. CEOs'traits and general competencies and
the environment had significant indirect effects.
This research explores the causes of venture
growth. In past entrepreneurship research, individual differences (Begley & Boyd, 1987), strategic
management concepts (McDougall, Robinson, &
DeNisi, 1992), and organization theory concepts
(Aldrich & Wiedenmayer, 1993) have often been
studied as isolated causes of venture performance.
The authors of more recent studies have proposed
that individual, organizational, and environmental
dimensions combine to provide a more comprehensive prediction of venture development and growth
than any one dimension in isolation (Chrisman,
Bauerschmidt, & Hofer, 1998; Covin & Slevin, 1997;
Herron & Robinson, 1993; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996;
Naffziger, Hornsby, & Kuratko, 1994; Sandberg,
1986). However, there has been limited examination of these multilevel models.
Our purpose was to propose and test a comprehensive multilevel model of venture growth. We
included five research domains that have been theoretically identified as antecedents of venture performance: personality traits and general motives,
personal competencies, situationally specific motivation, competitive strategies, and business environment. We chose venture growth as our performance measure, rather than other indicators of
performance, because entrepreneurship researchers have pointed to growth as the crucial indicator
of venture success (Covin & Slevin, 1997; Low &
MacMillan, 1988). Our goals were: (1) to test
whether a multilevel model that sampled relevant
concepts from individual, organizational, and
environmental domains would predict firm performance successfully, (2) to test whether each
domain would contribute something to the prediction, and (3) to explore alternative forms of the
relationship among the domains and performance.
By empirically examining multiple domains across

multiple levels, we hoped to produce a more complete understanding of venture growth.
THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Direct Effects: Entrepreneurs
Traits and motives. Personality theories point to
the importance of personal predispositions for venture success (McClelland, 1965), and venture capitalists have reported that entrepreneur characteristics
are extremely important for venture success (MacMillan, Siegel, & SubbaNarisimha, 1985). Some traits and
motives of successful entrepreneurs have been identified, but these concepts have typically produced
weak relationships (accounting for less than 7 percent
of the variance) with venture performance (Begley &
Boyd, 1987; Low & MacMillan, 1988). Furthermore,
Sandberg and Hofer (1987) found that organizational
and industry variables completely dominated individual-level variables as causes of venture success.
There are three possible implications of these prior
results: (1) traits do not matter, (2) traits do not work
in isolation from other factors, and (3) the wrong traits
have been tested in past entrepreneurship studies.
Our research design examined the second possibility.
To control for the third, we included additional traits
in our study that have been proposed as characteristics of successful leaders: tenacity, proactivity, and
passion (Bass, 1990; Locke, 1997). Furthermore, entrepreneurship theorists have proposed that tenacity
and proactivity-initiative are important for the successful establishment and operation of new ventures
(Bird, 1989, Chandler & Jansen, 1992). And Smilor
suggested that passion is "perhaps the most observed
phenomenon of the entrepreneurial process" (1997:
342). Thus, we predicted:
Hypothesis 1. With other antecedents of venture growth controlled, the greater the tenacity,

proactivity, and passion for work of a venture's
CEO, the greater the venture's growth.

effects of these three aspects of motivation and
predict:

Individual competencies. Competencies here refer to individual characteristics such as the knowledge, skills, and/or abilities required to perform a
specific job. Testing his job performance theory,
Boyatzis (1982) found significant performance relationships with "general" people and organization
competencies (oral presentation skill, decisionmaking ability, conceptualization ability, diagnostic use of concepts, and use of power) and "specific" competencies (technical skill and industry
skill). Entrepreneurship studies have developed
skill-ability clusters that are similar to those found
in Boyatzis's management-leadership theory (Bird,
1989; Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Herron & Robinson,
1990); however, opportunity recognition appears in
these studies as an important additional general
skill of entrepreneurs, and the components of people and organization competency are combined as
"managerial skill" (Chandler & Jansen, 1992). We
focus on two general and two specific competencies that appear in common in entrepreneurship
studies and predict that:

Hypothesis 4. The greater the situationally specific motivation of a venture's CEO with respect to vision, growth goals, and self-efficacy,
the greater the venture's growth.

Hypothesis 2. The greater the general competency of a venture's CEO with respect to organizational skills and opportunity recognition
skills, the greater the venture's growth.
Hypothesis 3. The greater the specific competency of a venture's CEO with respect to industry skill and technical skill, the greater the
venture's growth.
Situationally specific motivation. In this domain, we chose to study vision, growth goals, and
self-efficacy as motivation concepts, because: (1) all
three concepts have demonstrated significant empirical relationships with business performance
and (2) entrepreneurship theorists have pointed to
the importance of vision, business goals, and selfefficacy for planning and venture performance
(Bird, 1989; Low & MacMillan, 1988). Vision is a
core element of motivation in charismatic leadership theory (Bass, 1990). Indeed, two laboratory
simulations have shown direct and indirect performance effects for vision. More scientific validity
has been demonstrated for the goal theory proposition that specific, challenging goals lead to higher
performance than for any other motivation theory
(Locke & Latham, 1990). Entrepreneurship researchers have found that entrepreneurs' self-efficacy (task-specific self-confidence [Bandura, 1986])
in relation to their ability to start and "grow" their
ventures is associated with venture performance
(Chandler & Jansen, 1992). We examine the direct

Direct Effects: Competitive Strategy
Following Porter (1980), we conceive of strategy
in terms of three broad business-level choices: focus, low cost, and differentiation. Focus (a narrow
scope) refers to competitive strategies that target a
particular set of customers, segment of a product
line, or geographic market. The low-cost strategy
involves the construction of efficient-scale facilities, the aggressive pursuit of cost reduction and
cost minimization in all functions of an organization, and offering products to price-sensitive customers (Dess & Davis, 1984). Differentiation strategies are designed to create and market innovative,
high-quality products and/or services industrywide (Porter, 1980). According to Porter, the three
competitive strategies are alternative viable approaches for dealing with environmental forces.
Firms that fail to select one of these strategies are
"stuck in the middle" and, therefore, almost always
doomed to failure (Porter, 1980: 42). As Porter
noted, a stuck-in-the-middle firm lacks the investment in low-cost structure to compete on price, the
industrywide differentiation to offset the need for a
low-cost position, and the focus to achieve differentiation or a low cost within a limited market
space. Indeed, Dess and Davis (1984) found empirical support for this hypothesis. Thus, we argue
that firms that select one of the three types of strategies will outperform those that deploy a combined
strategy.
Hypothesis 5. A firm's competitive strategy will
be related to performance; more specifically,
firms that emphasize either a focus, low-cost,
or differentiation strategy will achieve the
highest growth.
Direct Effects: Environment
Theories have been proposed and empirically
supported suggesting that organizations are affected by their environments (Aldrich & Wiedenmayer, 1993). This study focused on three dimensions of environment: dynamism, munificence, and
complexity. Dynamism (negative stability) refers to
the level of environmental predictability; it is manifested in the rate of market and industry change
and the level of uncertainty about forces that are

<-----Page 3----->294

Academy of Management Journal

beyond the control of individual businesses (Dess &
Beard, 1984). Because stable environments are easier to navigate, we expect environmental stability
to be positively related to venture growth. Munificence refers to an environment's support for organizational growth (Dess & Beard, 1984). High munificence enables firms to cope with challenges by
obtaining outside resources. Complexity represents
the concentration or dispersion of organizations in
the environment (Aldrich & Wiedenmayer, 1993).
Complex environments, composed of many firms,
may be more difficult for entrepreneurs to comprehend. Thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 6. A firm's environment will be related to venture growth; more specifically, ventures in stable, munificent, and simple environments will achieve the highest growth.
Indirect Effects
Effects among traits, competencies, and motivation. Entrepreneurship researchers have pointed to
the likelihood that personality works in conjunction with other factors (Naffziger, 1995), or that the
relation of personality with performance is mediated by other factors (Herron & Robinson, 1993).
First, we propose that traits affect competencies
because individuals practice what they like, and
practice develops skill. For example, someone who
is tenacious and proactive and has a passion for
piano is likely to engage in daily keyboard practice,
but someone who is without these traits will tend
to avoid skill-building practice. Indeed, Boyatzis
(1982) found that managers' traits were manifested
in their competencies. Thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 7. The greater the tenacity, proactivity, and passion for work of a venture's CEO,
the greater his or her general and specific competency.
Second, we propose an indirect effect from traits
to venture growth mediated by situationally specific motivation. Locke (in press) showed that situationally specific goals and self-efficacy mediated
the effects of general traits on performance, and
Bird (1989), in her discussion of strategic vision
and goals, suggested that vision and goals are, in
part, a reflection of personality. Personality traits
(proactivity and tenacity) affect self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986); thus, we propose:
Hypothesis 8. The greater the tenacity, proactivity, and passion for work of a venture's CEO,
the greater his or her situationally specific motivation with respect to vision, goals, and selfefficacy.

Thirdly, we propose that general competencies
affect specific competencies and situationally specific motivation. Drawing upon Maier's (1965) theory that general ability and motivation combine to
produce performance, Bird (1989) proposed that
personal ability affects specific skills, vision, and
goals, which, in turn, cause entrepreneurship success. The path from general competencies to specific motivation is also consistent with social cognitive and goal theories that explain that people
base their goals and their efficacy evaluations on
self-knowledge about ability (Bandura, 1986).
Hypothesis 9. The greater the general competencies of a venture's CEO in terms of organizational skills and opportunity recognition
skills, the greater the CEO's specific competency in terms of industry skill and technical
skill.
Hypothesis 10. The greater the general competencies of a venture's CEO, the greater his or
her situationally specific motivation with respect to vision, goals, and self-efficacy.
Effects of traits, competencies, motivation, and
competitive strategy. Competitive strategies reflect
the choices of managers (Child, 1972). Thus, the
determinants of individual decision making and
behavior are among the determinants of strategy
because people choose plans in part on the basis of
(1) what they are predisposed to do, (2) what they
are motivated to do, and (3) what they think they
can do (Bandura, 1986; Hollenbeck & Whitener,
1988).
Strategy researchers have empirically linked top
management characteristics to innovation strategy,
strategic change, and other aspects of strategy
(Grimm & Smith, 1991; Michel & Hambrick, 1992).
Furthermore, the strategy implementation literature points to the importance of personal traits in
strategy formulation and communication. Since
these studies support the view that individual traits
are determinants of cognition and behavior, we
propose that traits affect strategic choice. In particular, we believe that tenacity, proactivity, and passion for work will lead CEOs to recognize the value
of competitive strategy for enhancing venture
growth.
Hypothesis 11. The greater the tenacity, proactivity, and passion for work of a venture's
CEO, the greater the likelihood that the venture will select a focus, low-cost, or differentiation strategy.
We also expect that general competencies will
affect the choice and implementation of competi-

<-----Page 4----->2001

tive strategy. Individuals tend to adopt and commit
to strategies that they believe are achievable (Bandura, 1986; Covin & Slevin, 1997; Herron & Robinson, 1993), and skills and ability may limit performance despite the existence of high goals and the
"right" strategy (Bird, 1989; Locke & Latham, 1990).
In addition, the resource-based view of the firm and
the strategic choice literature (Child, 1972) emphasize the link between managerial competence and
strategy.
Hypothesis 12. The greater the general competency of a venture's CEO with respect to organizational skills and opportunity recognition
skills, the greater the likelihood that the venture will select a focus, low-cost, or differentiation strategy.
We believe that an indirect causal effect from
motivation to venture growth is mediated by competitive strategy. Bandura (1986) asserted that motivation is a codeterminant (with environment) of
task strategies, the individual-level version of company strategies. Goal theory research has found that
task strategy can mediate the goal-to-performance
relation (Locke & Latham, 1990), and entrepreneurship theorists propose that business vision and personal goals affect competitive strategies (Bird,
1989). Therefore, we expect a CEO's motivation
will lead to recognition of the importance of competitive strategies for venture growth.
Hypothesis 13. The greater the motivation of a
venture's CEO with respect to vision, goals,
and self-efficacy, the greater the likelihood that
the venture will select a focus, low-cost, or
differentiation strategy.
Effects of environment upon strategy. We expect the environment domain to affect competitive
strategies, a view that is consistent with the views
of economists (Scherer & Ross, 1990), strategic
management theorists (Bourgeois, 1980), and social
psychologists (Bandura, 1986), and with the empirical findings of entrepreneurship researchers
(Sandberg & Hofer, 1987). For example, the entire
structure (environment)- conduct (strategy)-performance paradigm in industrial organizational
economics rests on the premise that strategy (conduct) will be influenced by industry structure,
which will in turn affect performance (Mason,
1939; Scherer & Ross, 1990). Furthermore, since
strategic decision-making is a human behavior, social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) points to the
determination of behavior by environmental (and
personal) forces. Finally, entrepreneurship research has found that new venture strategies are
formed in response to environmental forces

295

(McDougall et al., 1992; Sandberg, 1986). Thus, we
propose:
Hypothesis 14. Environmental stability, munificence, and simplicity will be related to a venture's strategy and, more specifically, to its
propensity to select a focus, low-cost, or differentiation strategy.
In summary, Hypotheses 1-6 represent a direct
effects model, which reflects a straightforward integration of concepts from multiple research domains. With Hypotheses 7-14, we present a more
complex set of indirect effects, explaining how entrepreneurial characteristics are interrelated and
how these characteristics and environmental forces
impact strategic decisions.
There is theory to support this more complex
integration: (1) Existing personality, competency,
and motivation theories underlie our hypothesized
individual-level indirect effects (Bandura, 1986;
Boyatzis, 1982; Hollenbeck & Whitener, 1988;
Locke & Latham, 1990; Maier, 1965). And growing
recognition of the importance of (2) individual differences (Grimm & Smith, 1991; Michel & Hambrick, 1992) and (3) environmental conditions
(Scherer & Ross, 1990; Schwenk, 1988) as inputs
into the strategic decision process supports our
proposed cross-level effects. Indeed, Schwenk
(1988) pointed to the importance both of rational
choice and cognitive heuristics theory from cognitive psychology and of environmental analysis and
scanning systems su'ch as the CP/IA (competitive
position/industry attractiveness) matrix (Hofer &
Schendel, 1978) for understanding the outcomes of
strategic decision making. The theoretical link between these indirect effects and venture growth is
competitive strategy. That is, strategic choice theory itself (Child, 1972) points to the efficacy of
strategic decision making for organizational performance, guiding our prediction that strategies affect
venture growth directly (Hypothesis 4).
We studied a single industry to avoid confounding by industry type (for example, mom-and-pop
versus high-potential industries) and industryspecific externalities. That is, we followed those
who have suggested that universal organizational
patterns and processes will be most apparent in
single-industry studies. In addition, we controlled
for organization size because size may systematically influence other concepts of interest. Indeed,
hundreds of studies have shown that size is an
important determinant of organization process and
performance.

METHODS
Industry and Participants
U.S. firms that manufacture and install architectural woodwork (doors, windows, stairs, cabinets,
and trim for residential, commercial, and major
public buildings) were studied; these enterprises
fall into Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
code 2431. Their products are sold to general contractors, architects, and interior designers. Typical
firms employ skilled woodworkers, productionoriented high-tech machinery operators, carpentry
installers, and project managers.
In 1993, the industry's 849 CEOs were invited to
participate; 442 agreed. Following an extensive pilot test, the questionnaire was mailed to each CEO,
and an adapted version was also sent separately to
202 employees whose participation had been authorized by their CEOs. The employee data were
used to test the validity of the CEO self-reports. The
questionnaire contained measures of the 17 predictor concepts studied and 1992 performance. The
employee and the CEO versions were identical except that references in the CEO version to "you"
and "your company" were changed to "the CEO"
and "the company" in the employee version. Performance data for 1994 were collected in 1995 via a
second questionnaire sent to the CEOs.
We received 414 CEO responses (49 percent), and
we used 307 in our study (36 percent of the population). We disqualified CEOs who (1) had founded
their businesses or purchased going concerns less
than two years or more than eight years prior to the
1993 survey, (2) had no or only one employee, (3)
were not active owner-managers, or (4) supplied
incomplete data. The average qualified CEO respondent had 16 employees and $1.5 million in
sales in 1992. Our net employee sample included
131 directly reporting employees (43 percent of the
net qualified CEO sample) who had worked with
the responding CEO for two or more years and had
submitted complete data. The typical employee
participant was a manager who had been in the
industry for six years.
To test whether the 414 respondents were representative of the population, we compared the mean
numbers of employees and the mean sales volumes
of the respondents with the population; differences
were not significant (employees, Z = 0.32, p < .38;
sales, Z = 1.0, p < .16).
Measures
Data were collected for the 17 theory-based predictor concepts from the entrepreneur-CEOs and
the employees, and the CEOs supplied data for the

April

control and performance concepts. Table 1 shows
the number of items, format, composite reliability,
and research source for the 17 predictor concepts.
Details are available from the first author.
We calculated three measures of venture growth
using data from the 1993 and 1995 CEO questionnaires. The first measure of the dependent variable,
average annual percent sales growth, was one-half
the difference between 1992 and 1994 sales, divided by the base year (1992). Similar calculations
produced the second and third measures, average
annual percent employment growth and average
annual percent profit growth (composite reliability = .87). We evaluated the accuracy of the raw
performance data by checking the agreement of results for a random sample of 25 of the firms against
Dun & Bradstreet reports of 1992 performance. For
the 21 of these cases for which Dun & Bradstreet
data were available, correlations were high (the
smallest r = .94, p < .001), and none of the means
differences were significant (the largest t = .96,
p < .36).
Organization size, measured as the number of
full-time equivalent employees at the end of 1992,
was entered as a control variable.

RESULTS
LISREL 8 and PRELIS 2 were used to (1) impute
missing data, (2) evaluate concept validity (reliability, including dual-source similarity and convergent and discriminant validity), (3) perform confirmatory factor analyses to verify the validity of the
proposed configuration of concepts and domains,
and (4) test the hypotheses. Univariate homogeneity testing (PRELIS2 HT) and multiple sample analysis (LISREL MSA) confirmed the similarity of the
response distributions of the 131 pairs of entrepreneur-CEOs and employee participants, as well
as the distributions of the entrepreneur-CEOs with
(n = 131) and without matched employee participants (n = 176).
As shown in Table 1, the measurement model
had ten concepts each with a composite reliability
(CR) greater than .80, six concepts with a CR between .70 and .79, and three with a CR between .60
and .69. All the concept-to-domain coefficients
were statistically significant (t > 2.0, p < .05); thus,
convergent validity was established. We verified
discriminant validity by determining that the average variance extracted by each latent variable's
measures was larger than its shared variance with
any other latent variable. The overall fit was acceptable (X22,572 = 5,961, p < .00; GFI = .90, AGFI =

checked for common source bias with LISREL confirmatory factor analysis by linking a common latent variable with all of the measures. The resultant
coefficient lambda (.16, t = .40, p < .05) indicated
that common variance was less than 3 percent.
Figure 1 shows the results of testing the prediction of venture growth using direct paths only (Hypotheses 1-6). Solution of the model produced an
acceptable

fit (X21o2 = 168, p < .00; GFI = .92,

AGFI = .89, PNFI = .63, RMSR = .06, RMSEA =

the independence model yielded a significant
change in chi-square (X236= 1,244, p < .01). This
solution was better than any solution with only one
predictor domain. Specific competencies, motivation, and competitive strategies have paths to venture growth with significant coefficients (t > 2.0,

p < .05). With regard to the strategy domain, we
observe that strategy is positively related with performance. More specifically, with regard to the reflections of the strategy domain, firms that select
and emphasize differentiation through high quality
(r = .31, p < .001) and/or innovation (r = .25, p <
.001) achieve the fastest growth. In contrast, firms
that employ low cost (r = -.22, p < .001) or focus
(-.27, p < .001) experience negative growth.
Neither traits, general competencies, nor environment are significant direct predictors of venture
growth (environment is a direct predictor only at
p < .10); thus, Hypotheses 1 (traits), 2 (general
competencies), and 6 (environment) are not supported. However, this direct domain-level structural equation solution provides support for Hypotheses 3 (specific competencies), 4 (situationally
specific motivation), and 5 (competitive strategies).
We tested the model with indirect paths according to Hypotheses 7 through 14. The solution
is shown in Figure 2. The indirect effects configuration produced

a good fit (X293 = 148, p < .00;

With the indirect effects model, we find that specific competencies, motivation, and competitive
strategy have significant direct effects upon venture
growth and that traits, general competencies, and
environment have significant indirect effects.
Traits affect specific competencies, motivation, and
competitive strategy, all of which are likely predictors of venture growth, and this pattern of findings
confirms Hypotheses 7, 8, and 11. Similarly, general
competencies affect motivation and strategy, which
confirms Hypotheses 10 and 12. General competencies also affect specific competencies (Hypothesis 9).
Motivation has a positive effect upon strategy, which
in turn affects venture growth, confirming Hypothesis
13. Environment affects venture growth through its
impact upon strategy, which supports Hypothesis 14.
Our prediction that complexity would be a negative
reflection of the environment domain did not hold;
nevertheless, the environment domain had a significant, positive effect upon competitive strategy, as hypothesized.
With direct and indirect effects taken together,
the LISREL total effects solution confirms that all
domains exhibit significant effects on venture
growth.

such as the structure/performance/economics paradigm (Mason, 1939; Scherer & Ross, 1990), population ecology theory (Hannan & Freeman, 1977), or
resource dependency theory (Pfeffer & Salancik,
1978).
The internal explanation for venture growth that
emerges from this study emphasizes entrepreneurs
and their roles in formulating strategy. The story
begins with a hard-working, proactive entrepreneur
with a strong set of technical, organizational, and
industry skills. This entrepreneur is highly motivated, which is reflected in a clear organizational
vision, high growth goals, and confidence in
achieving these goals. Perhaps because of tenacity
and proactivity, organizational skills, or high motivation, this entrepreneur is capable of delineating
an effective differentiation strategy that works to
generate high growth. We can speculate that the
entrepreneur's industry and technical skills and
high motivation influence his or her venture's
growth through the establishment of growthoriented organizational processes and structures
that facilitate the implementation of this strategy.
We also imagine that in these high-growth organizations, organizational culture becomes a reflection
of the tenacious entrepreneur. We now examine the
more specific results with the goal of further elaborating an internal explanation of venture growth.
An Internal Explanation

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The most important finding of this study is that
individual, organizational, and environmental research domains predict venture growth better when
the web of complex indirect relationships among
them is included than when only multiple simultaneous direct effects are studied. Furthermore, all
domains figure in the prediction of venture growth
when these total effects are considered, so that venture growth cannot be adequately explained from a
single perspective. Even the personal trait and specific competency domains, which do not contribute
to venture growth when studied in isolation, affect
venture growth through their effects upon more
direct performance links.
By studying multiple domains across three levels
of analysis and by including both direct and indirect effects, we were able to gain a more complete
understanding of the venture growth process than
has been gained in previous efforts. Moreover, from
the indirect model, we learned that such internal
explanations of performance as the strategic choice,
leadership, and entrepreneurship viewpoints were
more relevant for explaining venture growth in this
study than environment or external explanations,

Traits. Consistent with psychological theories
that explain individual performance (Hollenbeck &
Whitener, 1988; McClelland, 1965), traits were important predictors of venture growth here; however, they worked primarily through competencies,
motivation, and strategy. As operationally defined
in our research, an entrepreneur's traits serve to
influence the skill sets that are developed and the
level of entrepreneurial motivation, which in turn
affect strategy. This result offers an explanation for
why it is that practitioners and venture capitalists
continue to point to the importance of "the entrepreneur" for venture success (MacMillan et al.,
1985) even though entrepreneurship trait research
had not uncovered direct performance relations.
Perhaps researchers ought to look again at traits
and motives, but through mediation models that
test more complex causal chains.
Competencies. Technical and industry-specific
competencies should receive more research attention in entrepreneurship settings because the domain they reflect, specific competencies, had
highly significant direct effects here with venture
growth. We speculate that an entrepreneur's technical and industry competencies are an important

form of expert power that facilitates the implementation of the entrepreneur'svision and strategy.We
can further hypothesize that these entrepreneurial
skills may serve as sources of competitive advantage that rivals find difficult to identify and imitate.
Situationally specific motivation. Our results
for vision and goals and performanceare fully consistent with applied psychology and social psychology research (Bandura,1997; Locke & Latham,
1990). For example, goal researchers have found
that goal difficulty is directly related to performance, and social cognitive theory points to the
strong relation between self-efficacy and performance. We hypothesized that higher levels of entrepreneurial motivation and confidence would
shape organization structure and processes and
even work in the selection of goal-oriented employees. As a result-and consistent with Hambrickand
Mason (1984)-organizations led by highly motivated entrepreneurs may begin to reflect the character of these entrepreneurs, which may further
enhance performance.
Competitive strategies. Although differentiation
strategies related positively to venture growth, we
were surprised to find that the focus and low-cost
strategies related negatively. This finding may be a
function of the industry context, in that the sample
firms were geographically constrained craft manufacturers. Thus, at least for this sample, Porter's
theory does not hold, in that low cost and focus are
not effective strategic options.
Perhaps more interesting is our finding that individual differences affect competitive strategies.
Some strategyresearch has focused on top management team demography (Hambrick&Mason, 1984),
but our findings suggest that entrepreneur-CEO
traits, competencies, and motivation may offer
equally important explanations of strategic decision making. Indeed, established social cognitive
and goal theories point to personal characteristics
as determinants of personal strategies that are
likely determinants of organization strategies (Bandura, 1997; Locke & Latham, 1990). It would be

interesting to examine the relationship between entrepreneurs' personal motivations and strategies
and those of their organizations. We speculate that
in small organizations, the two sets may be the
same.
Environment. The direct effects of the environment domain were of borderline significance (p <
.10). However, the significance of the indirect effects on strategyenhance the generalizability of our
model because they are entirely consistent with the
structure -> conduct (strategy) -> performance par-

adigm in industrial organization economics (Mason, 1939). The relatively low impact of the envi-

301

ronmental domain on venture growth, with the
other, more micro dimensions controlled, is surprising; at least in our study, this finding suggests
that the CEOsof small firms may have more control
of their ventures' growth than some macro theories
suggest (Hannan & Freeman, 1977; Pfeffer & Salan-

cik, 1978), which could be an interesting avenue for
future research.
This study did not deal with two definitional
issues that confound entrepreneurship research,
namely, "Who is an entrepreneur?"and "Which
firms are entrepreneurial?"We simply used a sample of young, small businesses that were run by
active owner-managers,regardless of their mode of
entry, to identify predictors of venture growth. Nor
did we study other indicators of performance (such
as successful founding, survival, innovation, intangible assets, and personal goals). It would be important to, for example, find out if the competencies that contribute to venture growth also cause
successful founding. Furthermore,we modeled direct and indirect effects with linear equations
rather than with multiple-order equations because
structural equation modeling is not well suited to
testing nonlinear models. Additionally, although
our analysis of a single industry provided control of
industry effects, a few entrepreneurship researchers have found that industry effects are significant
determinants of performance. Only a few concepts
were used as reflections of the five research domains studied because of sampling limitations;
however, our finding that all domains figure in
venture growth suggests that use of relatively few
measures was not a failing.
The integrated entrepreneurship performance
model that was confirmed in this study offers a
platform and a guiding framework for those who
fund and manage ventures. We found that an entrepreneur's personality matters, but indirectly,
and that industry-specific skill and relevant technical skill directly affect performance,as do vision,
goals, and self-efficacy. Thus, there is evidence that
personality testing may help identify those who
can create and grow high-potential ventures; however, skills and motivation assessment may be even
more effective because these personal dimensions
are more directly related with performance. The
study also confirms the soundness of financiers'
interest in business plans that include clearly defined strategies.
The study suggests that entrepreneurs should
recognize that multiple personal dimensions affect
success. Thus, they must add, through partnering
or hiring, those personal dimensions they lack. Finally, it is apparent that entrepreneurship education programs ought to teach organization skills

(including vision and goal setting), opportunity
skills, and analytic skills (enabling business environment analysis for formulation of strategies).
CONCLUSION
We began by arguing for the need for a more
comprehensive explanation of venture performance. Overall, we found that explaining venture
growth is a complex process, influenced by a variety of interrelated micro and macro domains. Our
results are important because they begin to untangle the multifaceted process by which entrepreneurs affect competitive strategy and performance.
Perhaps other researchers can extend our proposed
internal explanation of venture growth. For example, they might utilize strategic decision making
(Schwenk, 1988) and strategic choice theories
(Child, 1972) to integrate cross-level effects by
studying the process by which entrepreneurs formulate and implement their strategies.
