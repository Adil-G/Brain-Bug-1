and their time directly in private companies. They do this
with the hope of nurturing ventures to a size and stage that
alternate sources of financing may be provided by venture
capitalists [ 191. Typically, PVCs assume equity or equitytype positions in private companies. On behalf of their
professional venture capital firms, they generally participate
along with the management of the companies in which they
invest, often with the intent of developing the company to
the point where an initial public offering (IPO) is possible.
Approximately 60% of all new ventures backed by venture
capitalists succeed in providing a return to the investor [21].
Their investments are expected to be relatively long-term,
often three to eight years. PVCFs are similar to PVCs, with
the main difference being their source of capital. While
PVCs are funded by private institutions, PVCFs consist
primarily of public funding.

Abstract We investigate the decision-making criteria used
by Canadian business angels, and venture capitalists to screen
investment proposals from early stage technology-based
ventures. This paper summarizes the main areas of interest to
the investors when screening proposals for the first time. We
found evidence that business angels focus on the characteristics
of the venture offering and venture capitalists (PVCs and
PVCFs) are primarily interested in understanding the
characteristicsof the entrepreneur(s) at the screening stage.

I. INTRODUCTION
Entrepreneurs seeking to develop technology-based
ventures require investment capital to finance their growth
at the early stages [I I]. Equity investors, especially venture
capitalists and business angels, are known to be frequent
sources of this capital. Typically, entrepreneurs present an
investment proposal to these investors in the form of a
business plan. What happens next, the decision-making
process and the weighing of criteria by these investors, is of
great importance to the entrepreneurs [17]. This paper
explores the decision-making criteria that most impressed
the investors when screening an early stage technologybased venture.
The three types of equity investors sampled in this study
are Business Angels (BAS, n= 20), Private Venture
Capitalists (PVCs, n= 20) and investment managers from
Public Venture Capital Funds (PVCFs, n= 20). A total of 95
criteria, derived from previous research in venture capital
decision-making and management of technology, were a
priori assigned into five categories: (1) Characteristics of the
Entrepreneur(s), (2) Characteristics of the Market, (3)
Characteristics of the Venture Offering, (4)Characteristics
of the Investment Proposal, and (5) Investor(s)
Requirements.
Data were collected using survey
questionnaires administered through personal interviews
with these investors across Canada.
Technology-based ventures (new and small) are defined
as those companies intending to commercialize a technology
for the first time and thereby expecting to derive a
significant source of competitive advantage from the
technology [4]. Examples might include software and
biotechnology companies. The early stages encompass the
seed, start-up and first-stages of financing [l].

It is reported that venture capital backed ventures
achieve a higher survival rate than non-venture capital
backed businesses [ 13, 161. Entrepreneurs seeking venture
capital can be expected to benefit if they understand what
criteria are most important to the venture capitalist. A better
understanding of the venture capitalists’ decision-making
process may lead to better investment decisions and thereby
more successful ventures and higher survival rates [21].

IT. LITERATURE REVIEW
Some researchers who have studied the decision-making
process and criteria used by venture capitalists to make
investment decisions include [18]; [9]; [17]; [7]; [8]; [12];
[W; WI; [61; P I ; P O I ; WI.
The activities of a venture capitalist can be described in
the form of a decision making process, which involves
multiple stages. A pattern of agreement among different
researchers seems to have emerged to suggest that the stages
are: (1) Deal Origination, (2) Screening, (3) Evaluation, (4)
Deal Structuring, (5) Monitoring, and ( 6 ) Cashing Out [ 181;
~ 4 1 PI;
; r31.
In describing a model of venture capitalist investment
activity, [I71 identified a broad range of criteria used at the
screening stage including: size of the investment, investment
policy of the venture capital firm, technology and market
sector of the venture, geographic location of the venture,
and stage of financing. Reference [6] identified two key
criteria used by venture capitalists for initial screening: fit of
the company seeking financing with the venture firm‘s

Reference [ 101 confirmed that during the screening stage,
venture capitalists focus on a small subset of criteria in a
non-compensatory process (i.e., an unacceptable value on
one criterion cannot be offset by a high value of another
one). The important criteria in this phase appear to be the
entrepreneur’s experience and the existence of a prototype
for some decision-makers or unique features of the product
for others.

111. METHOD
This study followed a survey research approach with a
questionnaire administered through on-site interviews. The
investors were requested to consider a recent example of an
investment proposal from an early stage technology-based
company that they had accepted for investment. They were
requested to indicate their first impression of the investment
proposal on a seven point Likert Scale. A response of “1”
implied an extremely negative impression, “4” implied a
neutral impression, and “7” implied an extremely positive
impression of the specific decision making criteria under
consideration. In the event that a specific criterion did not
apply to the investment proposal being assessed, the investor

indicated “N/A“ instead of selecting a numeric response.
Quantitative methods were employed to analyze data
obtained from closed-ended items in the survey
questionnaire. Remarks made by investors during the
completion of the questionnaire were also captured and
summarized qualitatively,

IV. RESULTS
The mean and standard deviation values of the
impression on each criterion were computed. Investors were
considered to be most impressed by those criteria with
means ~ 2 5 . 5and standard deviations (SD)I1.5 (our criteria
for being considered “very important”). Our results indicate
that BAS, PVCs and PVCFs use different sets of criteria
when screening an early stage technology-based venture. At
the screening stage, out of the 95 criteria investigated,
PVCFs were most impressed by 27, followed by BAS with
23 and PVCs with 15 criteria. Table 1 summarizes the
results of this study in relation to the different criteria that
the investors were most impressed by when screening the
investment proposals.

VI. FUTURE RESEARCH
The decision-making process used by equity investors
can be modeled as a sequence of multiple stages. The
process begins with deal origination, and involves two
distinct stages: screening and evaluating. Next, equity
investors structure a deal, monitor the investment, and cashout of the investment. In the future, we expect our research
will explore the decision-making criteria used by investors
when screening and evaluating an early stage technologybased venture.
