of Entrepreneurs

Even though the entrepreneurship literature places much emphasis on opportunity recognition, little is known about how entrepreneurs actually evaluate opportunities. This study
uses a cognitive approach to examine opportunity evaluation, as the perception of opportunity is essentially a cognitive phenomenon. We present a model that consists of four independent variables (overconfidence, belief in the law of small numbers, planning fallacy,
and illusion of control), a mediating variable (risk perception), two control variables (demographics and risk propensity), and the dependent variable (opportunity evaluation). We find
that illusion of control and belief in the law of small numbers are related to how entrepreneurs evaluate opportunities. Our results also indicate that risk perception mediates opportunity evaluation.

INTRODUCTION
The entrepreneurial process involves all the functions, activities, and actions associated with the perception of opportunities and the creation of the organizations to pursue
these opportunities (Bygrave & Hofer, 1991). In order to understand what promotes or
inhibits entrepreneurial activity, it is important to understand how entrepreneurs construct
credible opportunities and the role of perceptions in that process (Krueger, 2000). Some
researchers (Kirzner, 1973; Kaish & Gilad, 1991; Douglas & Shepherd, 1999) argue that
opportunity recognition is the cornerstone of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs often see
opportunities where others do not, and envision future possibilities that others fail to
recognize (Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000).
An opportunity is defined as a future situation that the decisionmakers deem personally desirable and feasible (i.e., within their control and competence). The state of
being “desirable” and “feasible” is subjective to the individual (Krueger, 1993). An
opportunity is said to exist when a bundle of resources can be sold at a higher price than
the cost to package and deliver this bundle (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Most entrepreneurs do not have problems generating ideas, as there are numerous sources of ideas

evaluate the alternatives presented to them. We term this process Opportunity Evaluation
(OE).
Deciding whether an idea is an opportunity involves judgments made under conditions of uncertainty and complexity (Das & Teng, 1997; Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000).
Closely associated with uncertainty is risk, which is the probability that an entrepreneur
is able to successfully turn an idea into an opportunity. An entrepreneur who fails in the
business could incur financial losses instead. As such, perceived risk is a significant aspect
of how entrepreneurs evaluate available ideas. Entrepreneurs are more likely to evaluate
an idea more favorably when they perceive less risk in that idea.
What is less known, however, are the antecedents of risk perception of entrepreneurs.
While others have shown that people’s cognitive biases affect their decision to start a
business venture (e.g., Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000), it is not certain whether entrepreneurs exhibit the same cognitive biases. Kirzner (1973) argues that entrepreneurs are
entrepreneurially alert and able to discern opportunities while others are not. Although
this assertion has been challenged (e.g., Gaglio, 1997), researchers have found that the
cognitive processes of entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs are different. For instance,
entrepreneurs focus on the future and engage in less counterfactual thinking than nonentrepreneurs (Baron, 1999).
In this article, we study how various cognitive processes affect opportunity evaluation, mediated by risk perception, as opportunity evaluation is essentially a cognitive
phenomenon (Palich & Bagby, 1995; Krueger, 2000). Such a cognitive approach can
help explain why some people start business ventures while others do not (Venkataraman, 1997; Baron, 1998; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). While some of the variables we
included are similar to Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000), the sample of MBA students that they used may not be representative of actions taken by entrepreneurs. Further,
the development of scientific knowledge requires testing propositions in different
contexts, so that they could either be refuted or be further supported (Popper, 1972,
pp. 240–242).
The flow of our study is as follows. First, the theoretical background and research
framework are presented. This is followed by the development of testable hypotheses.
We then describe the research methodology and conduct the empirical analysis. Finally,
the findings, implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH FRAMEWORK
Trait and cognition are two major approaches to distinguish entrepreneurs from
nonentrepreneurs and to understand how people make decisions (Das & Teng, 1997). The
trait approach asserts that entrepreneurs can be recognized by traits such as risk propensity, need for achievement, and locus of control (Palich & Bagby, 1995). The cognitive
approach is concerned with the entrepreneur’s preferred way of gathering, processing,
and evaluating information (Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000). The individual constructs
opportunities and risk in his or her mind (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Therefore, perception
and other cognitive phenomena are critical to opportunity evaluation and risk perception
(Krueger, 2000).
However, research using the trait approach has had limited success in explaining
entrepreneurial behaviors and perceptions. For instance, some studies have shown that

126

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->risk propensity, the personality trait that determines the tendency and willingness of the
individual to take risk, does not explain why entrepreneurs are willing to undertake a
business venture (e.g., Low & MacMillan, 1988). Subsequently researchers have turned
to the cognitive approach, and recent evidence suggests that this approach better explains
entrepreneurial behavior and perception. For example, researchers have shown that entrepreneurs exhibit systematic cognitive biases and overestimate their chances of success.
Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg (1988) find that 81 percent of entrepreneurs believe that
their ventures will have at least a 70 percent chance of succeeding even though 50 percent
to 71 percent of all new ventures discontinue after five years.
We are interested in understanding how cognitive factors influence opportunity
evaluation mediated by risk perception. The quality of decision making, in the riskcharged environments that entrepreneurs often face, can be improved with a better
understanding of risk and its role in opportunity evaluation (Forlani & Mullins, 2000).
While it is obvious that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions when they
perceive less risk, little is known about the antecedents of risk perception (Sitkin &
Weingart, 1995). Although there are many possible cognitive factors, Simon, Houghton,
and Aquino (2000) argue that the biases of overconfidence, illusion of control and belief
in the law of small numbers directly influence risk perception and the decision to start a
business venture. We include these three cognitive biases in an attempt to replicate their
findings.

Research Framework (Opportunity Evaluation Model)
Consistent with previous studies (e.g., Sitkin & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin & Weingart,
1995; Forlani & Mullins, 2000), risk perception is taken to drive entrepreneurial activities. Opportunities, among other outcomes, allow entrepreneurs to receive profits (Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000). However, there are risks involved in acting on an idea. Not every
idea is an opportunity, as entrepreneurs must cover the costs of gathering and delivering
a bundle of goods and services (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) and business overheads.
Entrepreneurs who believe that they are able to predict how well the business will do,
and perceive a low probability of failure will view the idea to be an opportunity that is
feasible and worth considering. As such,
H1: Perceiving a lower level of risk is associated with more positive opportunity
evaluation.
However, the factors that influence risk perception are less obvious. In this study,
we examine how different cognitive processes affect risk perception that in turn
affects the evaluation of whether a venture idea is feasible or viable. In particular, we
explore how cognitive biases influence decision making under risky conditions (Laibson
& Zeckhauser, 1998). Individuals do not have the cognitive capacity to process and
remember all information stimuli that arise from complex situations. Entrepreneurs
often find themselves in situations that are new and unpredictable. They are less likely
to have access to historical trends, past performance, and other information to reduce
the level of uncertainty at a relatively low cost (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). In addition,
more comprehensive decision making is not possible because entrepreneurs need to act
quickly to exploit brief windows of opportunity (Busenitz & Lau, 1996). Therefore,
entrepreneurs seek to minimize cognitive effort by using heuristics (mental shortcuts)
and simplifying strategies that lead to a number of cognitive biases. These biases in-

fluence the information that individuals notice and the conclusions they reach (Schwenk,
1984).
Figure 1 represents the model that we study in this article. Four factors are hypothesized to affect risk perception; risk perception in turn affects opportunity evaluation.
Three of the biases (i.e., overconfidence, belief in the law of small numbers, and illusion
of control) are adapted from Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000). Planning fallacy (i.e.,
individuals do not consider past experiences in similar situations because predictions
induce a future orientation) is included as the experience gained by the entrepreneurs is
likely to affect their cognitive processes. Repeated successes and failures will reinforce
the entrepreneurs’ cognitive frameworks regarding risk of ventures (Baron, 1998), which
we use as a mediating variable. Table 1 provides a summary of the relevant literature on
the four independent factors, the dependent variable (Opportunity Evaluation), and the
mediating variable (Risk Perception).

Overconfidence
Overconfidence refers to the failure to know the limits of one’s knowledge
(Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001), and this leads to overestimation of one’s certainty regarding facts. This bias is especially common in ill-structured decision situations, such as
deciding whether to introduce a new product (Simon & Houghton, in press). Overconfidence can occur because individuals base their certainty on the ease with which they
can recall reasons for confidence (i.e., availability heuristics). They do not revise their
initial estimates after receiving new data due to their initial overconfidence, and have
a tendency to seek supporting evidence instead of disconfirming evidence (Russo &
Schoemaker, 1992).

Variables Used in the Opportunity Evaluation Model

Table 1

Risk perception is taken as the intermediate construct that drives risky entrepreneurial decision
making. Risk perception mediates the relationship between the independent variables
(e.g., overconfidence) and the dependent variable (e.g., opportunity evaluation)
Entrepreneurs exhibiting overconfidence treat their assumptions as facts and thus see less
uncertainty and risk.
Entrepreneurs may perceive less risk because they are optimistic about their assumptions.
Entrepreneurs are more likely to get disproportionately more positive information because
failures are less well publicized and less cognitively salient.
This bias, coupled with mainly positive information, is likely to induce an overly optimistic
view of the venture and thus lower perceived risk.
Forecasts of future outcomes are often anchored on plans and scenarios of success rather than
on past results, and are possibly overly optimistic.
Previous entrepreneurial experience makes entrepreneurs more aware of the risks. Therefore,
it is likely for them to perceive less risk if they do not use past experience.
Entrepreneurs exhibiting illusion of control will underestimate risk because they believe their
skills can prevent negative occurrences.

Risk propensity (tendency and willingness to knowingly take risk) does not differentiate
the entrepreneur from the nonentrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs do not knowingly take risks; instead they perceive less risk.

An opportunity is a future situation that is deemed both desirable and feasible.
It is a subjective judgment on the part of the entrepreneurs.
The cognitive processes of the entrepreneur are important to the study of opportunity
evaluation. A cognitive approach was adopted.
Risk is one of the significant aspects of risky entrepreneurial behavior, such as
opportunity evaluation.

Findings

<-----Page 5----->Entrepreneurs exhibiting overconfidence tend to treat their assumptions as facts and
do not see uncertainty associated with conclusions stemming from those assumptions
(Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000). Thus, they perceive less risk. Entrepreneurs may
also perceive less risk as they are more optimistic about those assumptions (Russo &
Schoemaker, 1992). The optimistic outlook results in less information search (Zacharakis
& Shepherd, 2001). Thus, we posit that,
H2: Entrepreneurs exhibiting higher overconfidence will perceive less risk.

Belief in the Law of Small Numbers
Belief in the law of small numbers refers to individuals using a limited number of
informational inputs (a small sample of information, such as attributes and observations)
to draw firm conclusions (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971). People ignore sample size in situations when it should play a role because of the representativeness heuristic (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1971), which leads people to believe that small samples are highly representative of the populations from which they are drawn. Small, nonrandom samples are
not likely to be statistically valid and are not representative of the population as a whole.
Entrepreneurs do not use large random samples because they are rarely available. In addition, entrepreneurs do not have the resources to engage in systematic data collection
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997).
It is more likely for entrepreneurs to receive disproportionately more positive information because failures are less likely to be well-publicized (Simon, Houghton, and
Aquino, 2000). Furthermore, failures exist only for a short time and are therefore less
cognitively salient (Golder & Tellis, 1993). A stronger belief in the law of small numbers
coupled with mainly positive information is likely to induce an overly optimistic view
of the venture (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993) and thus lower perceived risk. This leads to
the following hypothesis:
H3: Entrepreneurs who have a stronger belief in the law of small numbers will
perceive less risk.

Planning Fallacy
Decisionmakers may not consider past experiences in situations with similar circumstances because predictions, by their very nature, induce a future orientation. They
tend to treat the current situation or decision as unique, thus isolating it from past experience. This is known as the planning fallacy (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). This fallacy
tends to operate more strongly in situations that are unique, filled with uncertainties, and
where there is a need for a focus on the future (Baron, 1998), such as the evaluation stage
of decision making. The planning fallacy is affected by a future time orientation (Mitchell
& James, 2001), and is particularly salient in Asian societies, where Confucian dynamism
reflects a short-term versus long-term orientation, along with other characteristics
(Hofstede & Bond, 1988).
An opportunity in the intertemporal markets does not yet exist except in the mind of
the entrepreneur; the entrepreneur must forecast future prices of goods and resources and
use intuitive judgment to gauge market potential (Kaish & Gilad, 1991). These forecasts
of future outcomes are often anchored on plans and scenarios of success rather than on
past results, and may possibly be overly optimistic (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). This

130

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->indicates that entrepreneurs will perceive less risk if the planning fallacy influences them
to a greater extent.
H4: Entrepreneurs who are influenced by planning fallacy to a greater extent will
perceive less risk.

Illusion of Control
Illusion of control is a bias in which an individual overemphasizes the extent to which
his or her skills can increase performance in situations where chance plays a large part
and skill is not necessarily the deciding factor. For example, people fail to respond differentially to controllable and uncontrollable events (Langer, 1975). There are two
reasons for this illusion of control (Langer, 1975). The first reason is that people are motivated to control their environment and the feeling of competence will result from being
able to control the uncontrollable. The other reason is that skill and chance factors are
closely associated and it is often hard to discriminate between chance and skill elements.
This is different from overconfidence as overconfidence relates to an overestimation of
one’s certainty regarding their metaknowledge (Russo & Schoemaker, 1992), instead of
their skills or abilities to cope with and predict future events.
It has often been suggested that entrepreneurs show an unusually strong preference
for exerting control over their outcomes because they believe they can exert control over
people and events (Shaver & Scott, 1991). Therefore, individuals exhibiting an illusion
of control will underestimate risk because they believe their skills can prevent negative
occurrences. Thus,
H5: Entrepreneurs with a stronger illusion of control bias will perceive less risk.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN
We first describe the sampling procedure and explain the rationale behind sample
selection. Then we operationalize the constructs for empirical testing. These measures
are used in the questionnaire sent to the respondents.

Sampling
In this study, owners of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were identified.
Das and Teng (1997) distinguished craftsman entrepreneurs from opportunistic entrepreneurs. Craftsman entrepreneurs are people who seek self-employment through starting a
business, e.g., a corner store. These entrepreneurs usually have no desire to grow the business. Opportunistic entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are growth-oriented and continuously pursue opportunities. Since we were interested in entrepreneurs that wanted to
exploit potential opportunities, we focused on opportunistic entrepreneurs.
A directory of the top 500 SMEs in Singapore was used as the sample. The Singapore SME 500 was the only independent performance ranking of Singapore’s top SMEs,
using audited financials and other key financial data. The founders of these companies
were likely to be opportunistic, as they had to constantly look for new opportunities for
their companies to be among the largest SMEs in Singapore.
A survey was used to collect data from these companies. The questionnaires, administered in English, were mailed to the respondents and confidentiality of the results was

but only 459 addresses were valid. The companies with invalid mailing addresses were
contacted by phone and fax to request their participation. A total of 465 companies were
contacted through mail, fax, or phone in order to improve the response rate. A search of
other business directories did not reveal whether the businesses with invalid contacts had
changed premises or had discontinued operations. A final total of 77 completed surveys
were returned, giving a 16.6 percent response rate. Table 2 presents some summary statistics of the sample.
Also, given the relatively small sample size, we were concerned about nonresponse
error. We applied the strategies explicated by Churchill (1995) to overcome this bias.
Firstly, we tried to increase initial response rate by selling respondents on the value of
the research and the importance of their participation. We also followed up with phone
calls and faxes for the initial nonrespondents. However, we did not attempt to adjust the
results, as it was not evident from our sample size that the means of the variables could
be meaningfully extended to the rest of the designated sample.
Examining the demographics of the entrepreneurs showed that 97.0 percent of
the respondents were male and 86.4 percent had postsecondary education and higher.
The profile was consistent with the profile of self-employed persons in Singapore

<-----Page 8----->(Department of Statistics, 1997). We also wanted to know whether there were differences
between founders of businesses and those who bought or inherited them. This was conducted using t-tests. Since the variable “belief in small numbers” had nearly half of the
observations missing, we only performed t-tests for the following variables: illusion of
control, planning fallacy, overconfidence, risk perception, and opportunity evaluation.
The results revealed that founders and purchasers did not exhibit significant differences
on any of these five cognitive constructs.

Operationalization of Constructs
A questionnaire (see Appendix) was constructed to measure each of the four independent factors (overconfidence, belief in the law of small numbers, planning fallacy, and
illusion of control), the dependent variable (opportunity evaluation), mediating variable
(risk perception), and control variables (demographics and risk propensity).
Risk Perception and Opportunity Evaluation. A short case study (see Section D of the
Appendix) was developed for the respondents to evaluate. Cases can capture the complexities of the evaluation of opportunities and have been used in several studies that
evaluated business venture decisions (e.g., Sitkin & Weingart, 1995, and Zacharakis &
Shepherd, 2001). The case method allows the context to be specified so that the respondents are exposed to the same set of information (Finch, 1987; Hughes, 1998). To make
the situations more concrete, we gave a name to the character, a practice recommended
by other researchers1 (Finch, 1987). Although long cases both contain rich information
and are more typical to entrepreneurs, we kept the case to half a page long. This is because
entrepreneurs might not be willing to take the time and effort to read and respond to a
longer case. Nevertheless, the length is typical of cases as part of a survey (e.g., Hughes,
1998). The case also allows us to study the information that the respondents focus on.
Following Sitkin and Weingart (1995), there was no indication in the case of the industry so that the respondents would not be influenced by the characteristics particular to
that industry.
Immediately following the case study, four items (Questions 1 to 4 of Section D)
were developed to measure perceived risk in the venture (a = .89). The four items captured the probability of loss, level of uncertainty in the situation, size of possible loss,
and overall risk of the venture. The four questions were summed to measure risk perception and a pretest indicated that the scale was reliable with a = .79.
Three items (Questions 5–7 of Section D) were developed to capture whether the
entrepreneurs viewed this venture as an opportunity (a = .90). Specifically, they were
developed to capture the perceived desirability and feasibility of the venture, and overall
opportunity. As defined earlier, an opportunity is a future state that is deemed desirable
and feasible. The pretest showed that the scale was reliable with a = .75.
Belief in the Law of Small Numbers. To capture the respondents’ belief in the law of
small numbers, they were asked to evaluate the case and describe their reasons for con-

1. A reviewer pointed out that in the questionnaire, we should have an instruction asking the respondent to
put him/herself in Mr. Tan’s shoes. We agree with this suggestion. However, the case is still valid because
respondents often enter into the spirit of the case, and identify themselves with the dilemmas that the character faces (Finch, 1987). Further, the instructions in the case specifically asked how much “you” (i.e., the
respondent) agree with different statements. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

<-----Page 9----->cluding whether they thought the venture was an opportunity (Question 8 of Section D).
They were required to give evidence that influenced their conclusion. The explanations
were analyzed and coded independently using the procedures of Simon, Houghton, and
Aquino (2000) and Busenitz and Barney (1997). A code of 1 was given for responses
that contained no mention of statistical reasoning, but relied on subjective opinions or
rules of thumb (e.g., opinions of a few associates or customers). A code of -1 was given
for responses that contained some form of statistical reasoning, including references to
the importance of market research, variability, or sample size. Other remaining responses
were assigned a value of zero. To form a continuous variable, the scores for all explanations were summed to give a single value.
Overconfidence. We adopted the format used by Russo and Schoemaker (1992) and
Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000), but adapted them to the Singapore context to
measure overconfidence. For each of the ten questions (Section C), there was only one
correct numerical answer. The subjects were asked to build a confidence interval that
they were 90 percent certain would capture the correct answer. If more than 10 percent
of the answers fell outside the range, the respondent was overconfident. The quiz measured what Russo and Schoemaker (1992) called metaknowledge (i.e., an appreciation of
what an individual knew and what he or she did not know). The respondents were asked
about general and not specific knowledge because entrepreneurs draw upon a wide array
of information when evaluating new venture ideas (Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000).
Planning Fallacy. Two items (Questions 3–4 of Section B) were developed to capture
the use of entrepreneurial experience in assessing the risk of a new venture idea (a =
.73). The first item identified whether the respondents believed that entrepreneurial experience would help in assessing the risk of the new venture. The second item measured
how likely the respondent would use past experience in businesses of a different nature
to evaluate the new venture. The scores for both items were reversed and summed to
obtain a measure of planning fallacy. The pretest showed that the scale was moderately
reliable with a = .69.
Illusion of Control. This measure was also adapted from Simon, Houghton, and Aquino
(2000). We measured the respondents’ illusion of control using the three items (a = .80)
in Questions 5–7 of Section B). The first two items were used to measure the subjects’
perception of their own ability to predict certain uncontrollable outcomes. The third item
was used to measure the perception of the subjects’ belief that their skills were better
than those of others, a belief that might not be related to a person’s objective skills
(Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988). The items focused on business events, which entrepreneurs often think that they can control or predict (Simon, Houghton, & Aquino,
2000).
Control Variables. Demographic information was collected in the questionnaire (Section
E). Due to the low variance in gender, race, and education variables of the sample, only
age was included in the analysis. A measure of risk propensity (Section A) was collected
and used as a control variable in the analysis. We chose the Risk Style Scale (Forlani &
Mullins, 2000) to operationalize risk propensity. This measure dealt with personal propensities toward financial risk taking, as opposed to other kinds of risks, and has shown its
efficacy in assessing the construct of interest. Ray (1994) suggests that entrepreneurs
do not have generalized risk-taking propensities, hence other research instruments that

risk situations actually encountered by entrepreneurs.

ANALYSIS
Three linear regression models were used to test the hypotheses of the opportunity
evaluation model. The three models were needed to test the mediation effects of risk perception on opportunity evaluation (Baron & Kenny, 1986), as shown in Figure 1.
Model 1 regressed risk perception (mediating variable) on the independent variables
(overconfidence, belief in the law of small numbers, planning fallacy, and illusion of
control). In addition to testing the conditions needed to show mediation, results from
Model 1 were also used to test H2, H3, H4, and H5. Model 2 regressed opportunity evaluation (dependent variable) on the independent variables. Model 3 regressed opportunity
evaluation on both the independent variables and risk perception. The three models are
represented in mathematical form as follows:
Model 1: y1 = a1 + b11 x11 + . . . + b16 x16 + e1
Model 2: y2 = a2 + b21 x21 + . . . + b26 x26 + e2
Model 3: y3 = a3 + b31 x31 + . . . + b37 x37 + e3
where ai = intercept of Model i,
ei = error term of Model i, and
xij = independent variables in Model i, where j = 1 to 4 refers to the independent
factors, j = 5 to 6 refers to control variables, and j = 7 refers to the mediating factor.
To verify the mediation effect of risk perception, four conditions had to be met (Baron
& Kenny, 1986):
1)
2)
3)
4)

the independent variables had to affect the mediator in Model 1,
the independent variables had to affect the dependent variable in Model 2,
the mediator had to affect the dependent variable in Model 3, and
the effect of the independent variables in Model 3 had to be less than in Model 2.

That is, the inclusion of the mediator into the equation would reduce the effect of the
independent variables on opportunity evaluation because part, if not all, of the effect was
indirect through the mediator. If the independent variable had no significant effect on the
dependent variable in Model 3, full mediation was supported. Full mediation implies that
the independent variables affect the dependent variable only via the mediating variable.
If the effect of the independent variables remains significant, only partial mediation is
supported. Partial mediation implies that the independent variables affect the dependent
variable directly, as well as indirectly, through the mediating variable.
Table 3 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients among
all the variables. These correlations showed that illusion of control was significantly related
to both risk perception and opportunity evaluation. This indicated support for H5. Further
examination of Table 3 suggested little collinearity among the independent variables.
Table 4 reports the results of the three regression models to test all the hypotheses.
The regression of opportunity evaluation on risk perception showed a highly significant
negative relationship, strongly supporting H1 that the perception of a lower level of risk
is associated with more positive opportunity evaluation. Model 1 showed that collec-

tively, the independent variables explained a statistically significant proportion of the
variance in risk perception at the .01 level (R2 = .30, Adjusted R2 = .20). Model 1 also
showed that illusion of control was significantly related to risk perception (b = -.76,
p < .01), supporting H5. Model 1 did not support H2, H3, and H4.
Model 2 was statistically significant at the .05 level (R2 = .31, Adj. R2 = .21). The
coefficients for the belief in the law of small numbers variable (b = 1.17, p < .06) and
illusion of control variable (b = .40, p < .05) were also statistically significant. Model
3, which included risk perception with the independent and control variables, explained
59 percent of the variance of opportunity evaluation with adjusted R2 = .52. Risk perception was negatively related to opportunity evaluation (b = -.50, p < .001). This
satisfied the third condition of mediation. By comparing the coefficients of illusion of
control in Models 2 and 3, a mediation relationship was supported. The coefficients decreased in magnitude after adding risk perception, meeting the fourth condition to support
a mediated relationship.
The results also indicated that belief in the law of small numbers had a direct
effect on opportunity evaluation. Model 1 showed that belief in the law of small numbers
had no significant relationship with risk perception. However, Model 2 showed that belief
in the law of small numbers affected opportunity evaluation. Thus, belief in the law of
small numbers had a statistically significant effect on opportunity evaluation, but not
through the effect on risk perception. Neither of the control variables (i.e., age and risk
propensity) was related to either opportunity evaluation or risk perception in all three
models.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
This article looks at one part of the opportunity recognition process—the evaluation
of opportunities. We use a cognitive approach to explore the extent that cognitive biases
affect opportunity evaluation, mediated by risk perception. The strong negative relationship between risk perception and opportunity evaluation (H1) is consistent with previous
studies (e.g., Sitkin & Pablo, 1992; Sitkin & Weingart, 1995; Forlani & Mullins, 2000),
in which risk perception has a significant effect on entrepreneurial activities, such as

<-----Page 13----->opportunity evaluation. For entrepreneurs, deciding whether an idea is an opportunity
usually will demand judgments under complex or even uncertain conditions. Thus, perceived risk plays a significant role; when the perceived level of risk is low, the entrepreneur is more likely to give the opportunity a positive evaluation.
The findings show that two cognitive biases (i.e., illusion of control and belief in
the law of small numbers) have a significant relationship with opportunity evaluation.
While illusion of control is fully mediated by risk perception, belief in the law of small
numbers has a direct effect on opportunity evaluation. The findings contrast with Simon,
Houghton, and Aquino (2000) who found that risk perception partially mediated the relationship between the law of small numbers and illusion of control on the decision to start
a venture. While Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000) studied a group of MBA students,
this study surveyed entrepreneurs of the top SMEs in Singapore. Baron (1998) asserts
that there could be key differences in the way that entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs
process information.
In our study, the effect of illusion of control on opportunity evaluation is fully mediated by risk perception. The findings suggest entrepreneurs perceive that they are able
to influence future outcomes and can take the appropriate actions to hedge the
risks. However, they do not believe they can control market conditions. This is probably
because they are owners of small businesses with limited influence on the market. On
the other hand, the MBA students in Simon, Houghton, and Aquino’s (2000) study could
have been less realistic and viewed that the viability of the venture resulted from their
own actions. Thus, the relationship between illusion of control and opportunity evaluation was only partially mediated by risk perception in that study. Future studies though
could improve upon the measures used in this study. For instance, Question B5 of the
survey states, “I can accurately forecast the total demand for my business.” Since the
sample of entrepreneurs is already successful, they are likely to agree to this statement.
To increase variance in the answers and to be predictive of a more general illusion of
control, the question could refer to “a business” instead of “my business.” This rephrasing also applies to question B7.
Belief in the law of small numbers may not affect risk perception because when opportunistic entrepreneurs evaluate business opportunities, potential benefits of the venture may
be more salient than risks since they are looking for reasons to accept ventures that help
grow their companies (Das & Teng, 1997). As argued by Simon, Houghton, and Aquino
(2000), overconfidence does not necessarily lead to lower risk because assumptions held
by overconfident respondents may not lead to optimistic conclusions. Another possibility
is that overconfidence may not be valid across domains. Future studies could use measures
of overconfidence specifically related to the entrepreneurial context.
Planning fallacy also did not affect opportunity evaluation. This could be due to selfserving biases—even if the entrepreneurs considered past entrepreneurial experience in
the decision-making process, they tend to attribute negative outcomes to external factors
beyond their control and successes to their own efforts (Baron, 1998). Another possibility is that the questions used to assess planning fallacy are too vague. For instance,
Questions B3 and B4 tap into general beliefs about whether experience is transferable to
new business situations, and beliefs about whether key business issues are similar across
different businesses. They might not assess the extent that a business owner relies on
past experience to assess the risks or opportunities. In future studies, the questions
could respectively be rephrased as “I use past entrepreneurial experiences to assess the
riskiness of a new business” and “I use past experiences in dealing with business
issues to run different types of businesses.”

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->Future studies should include other considerations in the model. The results indicate
that even though risk perception may be one of the more significant aspects in opportunity evaluation, the benefits of the venture have to be examined as well. Finucane and
colleagues (2000) show that people tend to view benefits and risks as inversely related
so that the judgments made are affectively consistent. Since entrepreneurs are usually
enthusiastic and confident about their own venture ideas, they are likely to see their own
ideas as beneficial and the risk as low. Other types of risk, besides financial risk, could
be considered (Yates & Stone, 1992). How contextual factors (e.g., networking, exposure to role models and government aid) interact with cognitive processes (Forlani &
Mullins, 2000) can also be explored in future studies.
While using cognitive processes to understand opportunity evaluation has been
shown to be a valid approach, future studies can incorporate other noncognitive factors,
such as skills (Herron & Sapienza, 1992), social skills (Baron & Markman, 2000), and
knowledge acquisition and learning (Schafer, 1990; Brush, 1992) into the model. Adding
these variables could potentially enable us to have a wider appreciation of opportunity
evaluation.
Further, most of the entrepreneurs are male Chinese with postsecondary education.
While this is the dominant profile of entrepreneurs in the Chinese-based economies like
Hong Kong and Taiwan, future studies can examine whether the results generalize to
other samples. For example, entrepreneurs with less education may perceive less risk
because the opportunity costs of alternative employment are lower. A further limitation
is that the results are based on the most successful SMEs in Singapore. Perhaps these
entrepreneurs are less susceptible to the effects of cognitive biases—a factor that led them
to be more successful in the first place. The alternative hypothesis is that past successes
exacerbate these cognitive biases.
A practical implication of the finding is that entrepreneurs’ opportunity evaluations are
influenced by the belief in small numbers and the illusion of control. In the former, entrepreneurs might consider a few cases or samples to be representative of a larger population
even if this is not the case. One way to attenuate this bias is to do systematic research. For
example, before embarking on a business venture, entrepreneurs could find statistics of the
size of the industry, the range of profits that firms in the industry make, and the failure rate
of firms in that industry. Relying on a few cases (e.g., by talking to friends in the industry)
might not be sufficient to make a comprehensive evaluation of an opportunity. The
illusion of control happens when entrepreneurs are more confident of their ability to predict
the outcome of events than they should be. There are several ways to overcome this bias.
A suggestion is to do systematic research. Through research, the entrepreneur can be
exposed to more information that can help them to make better-informed decisions rather
than to merely use their intuition. Another suggestion is to seek the views and advice
of others. In this way, they are able to have a wide range of information. Entrepreneurs
can also be encouraged to recall past failures. This will force them to recognize that certain
events are beyond their control, thus reducing the illusion of control bias.
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) argue that the domain of entrepreneurship research
concerns the sources of opportunities and the people who discover, evaluate, and exploit
these opportunities. While some people are more entrepreneurially alert than others
(Kirzner, 1973), cognitive processes in part determine whether individuals see an opportunity or not. Baron (1999), for instance, showed that entrepreneurs do less counterfactual
thinking than nonentrepreneurs. He argued that this is because entrepreneurs are forward
looking, focusing on opportunities instead of regretting events that did not happen according to expectations. Our study shows that cognitive biases also determine whether oppor-

Winter, 2002

139

<-----Page 15----->tunities are observed. Thus, entrepreneurial alertness may not only refer to an objective
realization of an opportunity as envisaged by Kirzner (1973) but also the subjective realization of this opportunity. Studying the heuristics and biases that people use can contribute to the literature of opportunity recognition by showing how individuals process
information that in turn affects their decision to start a business venture.
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) focus on the idiosyncratic knowledge and experiences that the individual brings to the opportunity recognition process. Future research
can explore how team factors, such as experiences of team members, team processes, and
external contacts can affect the opportunity recognition process. For instance, Houghton
and colleagues (2000) found that teams are susceptible to the biases of the law of small
numbers and illusion of control. These in turn affect the team’s perception of the risk of
a business idea. They also found that teams are more susceptible than individuals to the
law of small numbers bias. Shepherd and Krueger (forthcoming) argue that the team’s
perceived abilities and collective efficacy influence the team’s attitudes toward bringing
into existence new products and services. Therefore, future studies can use the team as
the unit of analysis. Finally, most studies, including this article, looked at how entrepreneurs evaluated their own business ideas. Future work can use external evaluations of
the business idea. External evaluations by individuals experienced in the new venture
process are crucial. These individuals, including angel investors, entrepreneurs, venture
capitalists, patent lawyers, and accountants, can provide funds and contacts to nascent
entrepreneurs.
We are hopeful that this study will spur a program of research that will enrich the
conceptual foundations of opportunity recognition and evaluation based on a cognitive
approach. The end goal, of course, would be that entrepreneurs have a better-developed
body of knowledge from which to draw in order to effectively and efficiently make
decisions.

Please answer the following questions after reading the case study.
Mr. Tan is a successful manager with four years of experience at a multi-national corporation (MNC). Before that he worked in a medium sized local company for five years.
The idea of being his own boss, taking calculated risks, and making a fortune all appeal
to him. Hence he is thinking of starting his own business.
He has an idea for a new business and decides to ask around to see if it is a good idea.
He has some very positive feedback from some potential customers and some associates
who know the industry well. Mr. Tan does not have the resources to do an in-depth market
research to find out whether the business is going to work and published data are too general
to be useful. However he feels that there is money to be made based on the positive
feedback from potential customers and his associates. He is enthusiastic about starting the
business even though he has no experience in this industry or starting his own business.
There are a few MNCs in the same industry but they have not targeted the market
segment that Mr. Tan is aiming for. He feels that the MNCs are likely to move into the
market as long as the new business is successful and he will not be able to fend off this
major threat. He is unsure whether the market is still growing or matured. If the market
has reached maturity, it is likely for a new business to be squeezed out of the market. If
the market is still growing, the new business will be able to survive the entry of MNCs
into this market segment. He finds out that there are only a few small businesses that are
still surviving in the industry.
Mr. Tan estimates he will need at least S$150,000 to finance the new business. As he
has only S$40,000 in savings, he has to borrow from the bank or find partners to get the
rest of the investment funds needed.
