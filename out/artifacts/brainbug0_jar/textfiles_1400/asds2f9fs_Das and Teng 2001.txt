Abstract
The literature on the strategic alliance structuring process does not provide an adequate view of the
role of decision-makers in that process, especially about how alliance partners form their structural
preferences. Given the critical role of structure in alliance management, the decision-making process
regarding the choice of an appropriate alliance structure deserves particular research attention. We
propose a model of strategic alliance structuring that has managerial risk perception as its core. Our
model consists of the following parts: the antecedents of risk perception, relational risk and
performance risk, risk perception and structural preference, and the resolution of preferences. We
suggest that the structural preferences of partners are based on their perceptions of relational risk and
performance risk, and the overall objective is to minimize the total risk. We also develop a number of
propositions as elaboration of the model to facilitate empirical research and the effective management
of the structuring process. D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

from others. As a result, the formation of strategic alliances, defined as voluntary interfirm
co-operative arrangements, has become a noteworthy trend in recent years. In search of the
so-called ``collaborative advantage,'' many firms are finding their performance and survival
increasingly dependent on their collective activities with other firms.
A large number of scholars have attempted to understand the rationale, process, and
implications of strategic alliances (e.g., Alter and Hage, 1993; Das and Teng, 2000a,b; Doz,
1996; Ring and Van de Ven, 1992, 1994; Yoshino and Rangan, 1995). One distinctive
characteristic of strategic alliances is the remarkable variety in their governance structures,
which include joint ventures, direct equity investment, joint R&D, joint manufacturing and
marketing, shared distribution, research consortia, licensing, and others.
The vital importance of alliance structures is evident in the finding of a recent study
conducted by Yoshino and Rangan (1995, p. 79): ``Virtually every manager interviewed in
our study believed that the success or failure of alliances hinged on their structures.'' In recent
years, researchers have shown an interest in the following critical question: ``Why is a
particular governance structure preferred over others?''. Relevant studies have drawn their
inspiration from a variety of theoretical perspectives, such as transaction cost economics,
social exchange, resource dependence, strategic behavior, bargaining theory, and the
resource-based view.
Despite these efforts, none of these theoretical perspectives place the strategy-makers and
their decision-making processes at the central core. Based on an empirical study of senior
business executives, Das (1986) contends that the role of individual strategic decision-makers
constitutes a significant factor in strategy-making, because no appreciation of strategic
outcomes can be achieved without understanding the nature and impact of this role. As
Anderson and Paine (1975, p. 812) note, ``strategy formulation is subject to many subjective
(behavioral, political, emotional) forces which influence its ultimate form.'' While some
researchers have examined decision-making in strategic alliances, alliance structural decisions
have not been studied in a decision process perspective. In this sense, it would seem that the
extant literature may have missed important explanatory variables for alliance structural choice.
In this article, we highlight the crucial role played by managerial perceptions in alliance
structuring. Specifically, we propose a risk perception model of strategic alliance structuring
that seeks to explain the choice of alliance structure as the outcome of a decision-making
process. Our research question here is two-fold: how do the partner firms develop their
structural preferences in alliances, and how are these different preferences reconciled? We
believe risk perceptions of the strategy-makers serve as the heuristic that helps form their
respective structural preferences, which are then resolved on the basis of bargaining power.
Thus, we have a process-oriented model of strategic alliance-making that has been called for
by various scholars.
We divide the article into three parts. First, we critically review the studies on decisionmaking in strategic alliances. Second, we present our risk perception model comprising
four components: antecedents of risk perception, relational risk and performance risk,
structural preferences and risk perceptions, and preference resolution. We also derive a
number of propositions from the model to facilitate empirical research. Lastly, we discuss
the contributions and implications of our model for research and practice of strategic
alliance structuring.

2. Decision-making in strategic alliances
The growing interest in strategic alliances has begun to provide us with significant
research insights. However, most major perspectives Ð e.g., transaction cost, social
exchange, and strategic behavior Ð attempt to answer the question ``Why strategic
alliances?'' instead of the question ``How to structure strategic alliances?''. Clearly, none
of these perspectives approach the issue with due regard for the strategic decision-making
processes. Indeed, existing approaches have been criticized for lacking a process orientation
(Ring and Van de Ven, 1994).
A fair number of scholars have studied strategic decision-making in alliances, typically
aiming at understanding the perceptions and decision contexts that form the basis of the
partners' decisions. The essence of this approach lies in the prominent role assigned to
decision-makers in the alliance-making process. Alliance decision-makers are no longer
assumed as completely rational Ð rather, they are believed to have limitations in
reasoning capacity.
Two principal research streams may be identified. The first stream is concerned with the
decision-makers' perceptions regarding alliances. Ring and Van de Ven (1992) suggest that a
perception of high-risk/high-trust prompts companies to prefer relational contracts Ð that is,
strategic alliances. Geringer (1988), while studying the process of partner selection in joint
ventures, examined executives' perceptions of task-related and partner-related criteria.
Anderson et al. (1994) propose that firms' perceptions of interdependencies greatly affect
their need for co-operation. Also, Cullen et al. (1995) found that perceptions of satisfactory
joint venture performance enhanced the partners' commitment to the alliance.
The second stream of research pertains to the heuristics or decision rules that the partners
rely on in the decision process. According to Ring and Van de Ven (1994), partners use
heuristics such as risk vs. trust and efficiency vs. equity in the process of developing strategic
alliances. Koot (1988) suggests that strategy-makers should consider several dilemmas in a
strategic alliance, such as exploitation vs. investment and fight vs. co-operation. Others argue
that decision-making in strategic alliances is akin to the so-called ``prisoner's dilemma''
situation, in which the partners depend on but are not sure about the partner's co-operative
behavior. It has also been suggested that the need to mimic other firms facilitates the decision
to participate in joint ventures (Kogut, 1988; Venkatraman et al., 1994).
A void in the literature is that, with a few exceptions (e.g., Ring and Van de Ven, 1992,
1994), most studies do not coherently comprehend both aspects of alliance decision-making
Ð namely, perceptions and heuristics. While perception of the alliance represents a firm's
assessment of the situation, heuristics provide a means toward simplifying and making sense
of the situation and then reaching decisions. Particularly in terms of the structuring process,
we still know little about how partners decide upon their preferred alliance structure. We
thus need to understand the specific linkages between partners' decision-making processes
and their structural preferences. Also, since partner firms are likely to have different
structural preferences, we need to explore how their preferences are reconciled through a
negotiation process.
In sum, we believe that a process model of strategic alliance structuring should address
both of the following two questions: how do the partners come to form their own structural

<-----Page 3----->4

preferences, and how are these different preferences reconciled? We propose a model that
includes risk perception and bargaining power. The risk perception view deals with the first
question by describing a decision process that results in a firm's structural preference. The
bargaining power perspective addresses the second question and explains preference resolution and structural outcomes. We should mention, though, that the model we propose focuses
on the structuring of strategic alliances Ð it does not attempt to explain why decision-makers
prefer strategic alliances over other strategies.
3. The risk perception model
In this section, we present a risk perception model of the strategic alliance structuring
process. The model includes managerial risk perceptions and various antecedents to the
perceptions. The dependent variable is the governance structure of strategic alliances. Fig. 1
presents the risk perception model.
Managerial perceptions are considered a key ingredient in strategic decision-making.
Decision-makers have been found to react to a situation based on their perceptions of the
environment. Although there are few empirical studies exclusively with top managers, Das
(1986) has demonstrated, based on a survey of a large sample of senior business
executives, how managerial perceptions of the task environment are critical in understanding their strategic intentions. His assumption was that the perception of the strategy
environment was the first step in the strategy-making process Ð followed by environmental evaluation, strategy delineation, and strategy implementation. Many theorists
suggest that managerial perceptions mediate the objective environment and strategic
decisions (Das, 1986; Thomas et al., 1993).
Compared to the traditional industrial organization economics approach to strategy
formulation Ð which relies exclusively on the objective environment Ð the managerial
perceptions view helps capture the essence of the decision process. Although a relatively
low correlation between the ``objective'' and the ``perceived'' environment has been
reported (e.g., Downey and Slocum, 1982), theorists tend to agree that it is the ``perceived''
environment that is most relevant to the process of making strategic decisions. Probably
owing to such a belief, many studies on managerial perceptions show a tendency of not
accounting for the objective environment (Bateman and Zeithaml, 1989). Few studies have
paid sufficient attention to the connection between the objective environment and managerial perceptions.
In the area of strategic alliances, in order that we relate managerial perceptions with the
objective environment, we will examine various antecedents of managerial perceptions,
including the objective factors of the competitive environment. Researchers have found that
the personal characteristics of key decision-makers, such as CEOs, significantly affect the
strategic choices of firms (Chaganti and Sambharya, 1987). Hence, we examine here certain
personal traits of key managers formulating alliance strategy that we believe contribute to
their risk perceptions.
Scholars suggest that, within the broad topic of managerial perceptions, we need to give
special attention to uncertainty and risk perception (March and Shapira, 1987). Anderson and

Paine (1975) argue that there are two key sets of managerial perceptions: the perception of
environmental uncertainty and the perception of the need for strategic action. The importance
of uncertainty and risk perception is also implied in Thompson's (1967) observation that, at
the organizational level, firms seek to control the uncertainties in their competitive environment.2 An emerging view suggests that most managers understand risk as the possibility of
unfavorable performance, or downside risk. Here, following this view, we define risk in terms
of negative outcome variances.
3.1. Two types of risk: relational risk and performance risk
Risk perception provides a particularly revealing perspective for studying strategic
alliances. We use the term ``risk perception'' to refer to those ambiguities, as perceived by
prospective alliance partners, about the future events that may negatively impact on the
performance of the alliance. Alliance performance refers to the degree to which partner firms'
objectives are achieved in an alliance. While the success of all other strategic maneuvers
depends solely on the firm's actions vis-a-vis the general and competitive environment, the
success of strategic alliances is contingent additionally on the effective co-operation between
the partners. Hence, strategic alliances are not only constrained by the objective business
environment, but also by the conduct of each partner. Besides the usual ``business'' risk,
strategic alliances attract the additional dimension of risk to prospective partners in terms of
the level of mutual co-operation. Ring and Van de Ven (1992, pp. 92±93) identify two
distinct sets of uncertainty in strategic alliances: ``uncertainty regarding future states of
nature'' and ``uncertainty whether the parties will be able to rely on trust.'' Proceeding along
similar lines, we differentiate between relational risk and performance risk in strategic
alliances (Das and Teng, 1996, 2001, in press a). Recently, these risk types have been used in
empirical research on how executives perceive the potentials of prospective technological
alliances (Tyler and Steensma, 1998).
Relational risk is concerned with the probability and consequences that a partner firm
does not commit itself to the alliance in the desired manner. In other words, it encompasses
those relational problems that may hinder the achievement of strategic objectives, such as
the partner's opportunistic behavior. On the other hand, performance risk refers to those
factors that may jeopardize the achievement of strategic objectives, given that the partners
co-operate fully. To strategy-makers, relational risk and performance risk represent two
independent types of risk Ð the former is internally oriented and the latter more externally
oriented. While relational risk is concerned with the relationship between the partners,
performance risk refers to the relationship between the partnership and the environment.
Performance risk is common to all strategic decisions, but relational risk is unique to
strategic alliances.

Traditionally, risk has been defined as outcome variances with known probability, while outcome variances
with unknown probability have mostly been referred to as uncertainty. However, since in the area of strategy such
probabilities are hardly known, risk tends to be broadly used for variances with unknown as well as known
probabilities. As a result, ``there remains considerable overlap within strategy literature in the usage of the terms
`risk' and `uncertainty''' (Baird and Thomas, 1985, p. 231).

3.1.1. Relational risk
Relational risk reflects decision-makers' concerns about the level of co-operation between
the partners. One source of relational risk is the concern about the partner's opportunistic
behavior Ð that is, ``self-interest seeking with guile'' (Williamson, 1975, p. 9). Examples of
opportunistic behavior include ``withholding or distorting information, shirking or failing to
fulfill promises or obligations, appropriation of the partner firm's technology or key
personnel, late payments, and delivery of substandard products'' (Parkhe, 1993, p. 828). In
fact, transaction cost theory assumes that some economic actors are opportunistic, so that they
will exploit unilateral benefits whenever possible.
Opportunistic behavior is a widely observed phenomenon Ð some firms and people pursue
their own interests at the expense of others. Thus, to perceive relational risk on account of
opportunistic behavior is also legitimate. In order to control the partners' opportunistic
behavior, detailed contracts containing explicit deterrents to opportunistic behavior will need
to be written, involving considerable writing and monitoring expenses. In international
alliances, a perception of opportunism may be attributed to a lack of cultural understanding
and responsiveness (Lane and Beamish, 1990). That is, cultural differences in dealing with
business partners may sometimes be interpreted as opportunistic behavior (Horng, 1993).
Another source of perceived relational risk may arise from expected inequities regarding
payoffs in alliances. The necessary condition for co-operation is a distribution mechanism
that is perceived as equitable. Equity refers to a proportionate payoff based on one's input,
i.e., the more inputs the more payoffs. Therefore, the need for equity, or the need to be treated
fairly, can seriously affect the relationship between the partners.
According to the equity theory of motivation, those who perceive themselves as being
treated unfairly will be motivated to restore a sense of equity. Similarly, a partner firm, which
foresees an inequitable pattern of payoffs, may expect itself or its partners to behave
discordantly in the future. If one partner feels that the other partner gains too much from
the alliance as compared to its own gain, it may begin to commit itself less, notwithstanding
its own stake. In fact, Ring and Van de Ven (1994, p. 94) note that the partners in strategic
alliances may ``rely more heavily on equity than efficiency in assessing their relationship.''
Nevertheless, some may argue that payoff inequities occur only after an alliance has been
initiated and, thus, cannot affect risk perception prior to the alliance formation. In fact, we
believe that many factors can lead the partners to expect inequitable payoffs, even before the
alliance is forged. Such factors may include partner asymmetry, a lack of alternatives for one
partner, adverse legal environment, and so on. Although expected inequity may discourage
alliance formation, it does not necessarily rule out a prospective alliance.
Scholars also observe that alliances between direct competitors are not likely to be
successful (Bleeke and Ernst, 1995; Park and Russo, 1996). One explanation is that in the
case of direct competitors, the payoff from an alliance is likely to be perceived as inequitable,
because a gain for one partner often means a loss for the other partners. Therefore, expected
inequity will lead the partners to worry about adequate co-operation, and thus perceive high
relational risk.
The perception of relational risk can be closely related to trust between the partners. Trust
is often defined as ``a particular level of the subjective probability with which an agent
assesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action'' (Gambetta,

<-----Page 7----->8

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

1988, p. 217). Some scholars have noted that a sense of trust can lessen the level of risk
perceived in co-operation.
The role of interfirm trust in strategic alliances is also receiving increasing attention (see, for
example, the 1998 special research forum on trust appearing in the Academy of Management
Review). A certain minimum level of trust is believed to be an essential element in structuring
interfirm alliances (Axelrod, 1984). Bradach and Eccles (1989) suggest that there are two
mechanisms to stabilize partner relationship: formal (written contracts) and informal mechanisms (trust). Clearly, since interfirm trust eases the concern about opportunistic behavior,
detailed written contracts may be less warranted. Detailed contracts and interfirm trust are the
two ways to make the behavior of partners predictable. Of course, detailed contracts cannot
ensure predictability if they are not abided by in practice.
Researchers have long examined the various dimensions of trust. One popular view is that
trust has two main dimensions: (1) one's ability (competence trust), and (2) one's intentions
(goodwill trust) to act in a desirable manner (Nooteboom, 1996). Ganesan (1994) has called
the two dimensions ``credibility'' and ``benevolence.'' It seems that goodwill trust (or
benevolence) would reduce the perception of relational risk, simply because a positive
assessment of one's intentions would lead to a belief that opportunistic behavior is less likely
(Das and Teng, 1998c). Similarly, it can be argued that competence trust would reduce
perceived performance risk because of a positive belief in one's ability.
3.1.2. Performance risk
Generally, performance risk is the probability and consequences that a firm's strategic
objectives are not achieved, despite full co-operation. Thus, performance risk is a type of risk
that exists when the relational risk is assumed to be nonexistent (that is, assuming full partner
co-operation). Accordingly, the two types of risk have a supplementary relationship with each
other when considering the total risk in an alliance. Performance risk arises from factors such
as the volatility of the market and a lack of competence on the firm's part. Specifically, in
strategic alliances, performance risk refers to the hazards that an alliance may fail, despite the
efforts and co-operation of the partners.
Furthermore, the measurement of alliance success can be complicated because it may be
based on differing criteria, such as long-term profitability and short-term profit. The key lies
in the attainment of partners' objectives in the alliance, such as setting technological
standards, new market entry, and so on. Glaister and Buckley (1996) found that various
objectives of alliances can be clustered into five groups: technology development, market
power, market development, resource specialization, and large projects. Since partner firms
often have different objectives in an alliance, alliance performance may vary significantly
among them. As such, partner firms tend to have different risk perceptions and alliance
structural preferences, which need to be reconciled (a topic we will discuss later). Also, the
achievement of alliance objectives depends on a number of factors, including the general
environment (e.g., government regulations and political risks), the competitive environment
(e.g., business decisions of major rivals), and the internal environment (e.g., a lack of core
competence and the ability to work together).
A variety of terms describe the different kinds of performance risk in a strategic choice,
such as commercial and technological risks, R&D risk, international risk, corporate risk, and

<-----Page 8----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

9

strategic risk. These can be viewed as different components of performance risk, their roles
varying according to alliance types. For example, R&D risk is by far the most important risk
component in R&D alliances. Partner firms are exposed to international risk when the alliance
straddles country borders. These risks are not related to relational risk, because no matter how
satisfactory the level of co-operation between the partners, these risks will always be present.
Single-firm efforts and interfirm co-operation are alternative ways to carry out a project.
For example, new market entry can be achieved either through greenfield development by the
foreign company itself or through a joint venture with a local partner. The foreign company
can either bear the performance risk of the project by itself, or it can share the alliance's
performance risk. Plainly, a shared performance risk via an alliance will usually be lower than
the performance risk of a project carried out by one firm. Inasmuch as the partners have to
contend with performance risk of a project, strategic alliances constitute an effective way to
control that performance risk.
According to the resource-dependence model, strategic alliances are adopted to control the
uncertainties and risks in the environment. By pooling the resources of several firms, the
likelihood of success is enhanced. Researchers identify risk sharing as a key motive for
forming strategic alliances, including R&D risk and marketing risk. Strategic alliances also
allow the firms to undertake those ventures that are considered too risky for a single firm Ð
such as expensive basic research. In fact, Brouthers (1995) reports that the perception of high
risks prompts strategies which shift risks and control to other firms.
By definition, the total risk in an alliance is made up of the two mutually independent types
of risk, relational risk and performance risk. We should note here that the two types of risk
can have no direct effect on each other, so that there is no complementary relationship. A
change in one type of risk will not have any direct impact on the other on account of their
mutually exclusive risk domains in an alliance. The difference between relational risk and
performance risk can also be considered in the following way: whereas relational risk is
created when forming a strategic alliance, performance risk of a project can be shared and
mitigated by the alliance. While there are factors that may affect both relational risk and
performance risk, the two remain conceptually independent because they deal with separate
aspects of alliances (Das and Teng, 1998a). Decision-makers who examine the feasibility of
strategic alliances and the choice of an appropriate governance structure should keep in mind
the distinct connotations of these two types of risk (Das and Teng, 1999). Accordingly, in
selecting alliance partners, alliance managers need to consider two separate questions about
the partner firm: (1) will the partner collaborate in good faith (relational risk)? and (2) does
the partner have adequate resources and capabilities to carry out its responsibilities in the
alliance (performance risk)? These two questions should help managers in focusing on two
distinctive yet equally critical aspects of partners.
3.2. Antecedents of risk perception: psychological traits
Perceptions of relational risk and performance risk in an alliance can be attributed to
various factors. In this article, we examine two groups of factors that have a direct impact on
the risk perceptions in strategic alliances: the psychological characteristics of strategy-makers
and the situational characteristics. We adopt the view that the characteristics of the

<-----Page 9----->10

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

strategy-makers will strongly influence strategic choices (Bateman and Zeithaml, 1989;
Dickson and Weaver, 1997). Researchers argue that strategic decision-making can be partly
explained in terms of certain characteristics of the top management team (TMT) or CEO, such
as their psychological and background characteristics. Although some may argue that a TMT
is often not homogeneous in terms of personal characteristics, the overall tendency of the
team can be viewed as an aggregation of the tendencies of the individual members. Wiersema
and Bantel (1992) found that group heterogeneity in a TMT's demographic characteristics is
less important in predicting strategic choices than the team's average characteristics. Thus,
here we assume that the overall tendency of a TMT is the aggregated level of relevant TMT
member attributes. In empirical terms, the aggregation may be weighted according to the
corporate positions of the individual respondents in the firm to reflect the fact that a CEO
carries more weight than a Senior Vice President. Following Aiken and Hage (1968), we may
also obtain an average score for each position level Ð e.g., Senior VP and VP Ð and then
compute an overall mean of the scores. While there are potentially a host of psychological
and situational characteristics that are relevant, we suggest that some factors have a clear
linkage with our two risk constructs. In fact, we do not intend to be exhaustive in the
selection of the following few factors. Rather, we mean to show that strategists' risk
perceptions can be strongly influenced by some psychological factors as well as by some
situational ones. Here we discuss only three psychological characteristics: trust propensity,
locus of control, and future orientations of strategy-makers. Later, we will discuss four
situational characteristics.
3.2.1. Trust propensity
The perception of risk can be closely related to trust between the partners (Mayer et al.,
1995). Scholars argue that perceived risk in co-operation is mitigated by a sense of trust (Das
and Teng, 1998b, in press a). By definition, interfirm trust refers to a belief in the partner's
goodwill Ð that is, the confidence that the partner will not act opportunistically. According to
Rotter (1967) interpersonal trust is an individual personality trait Ð that is, a predisposition to
believe in others' goodwill. Individuals have a general belief about the goodness and
trustworthiness of people and they act according to this belief. Decision-makers can thus
be differentiated as being either ``high'' or ``low'' on trust propensity. The idea is that while
another party's trustworthiness can be the same, individuals high on trust propensity will be
more likely to be trusting, as compared to those low on trust propensity (Rotter, 1967).
Applying this view to alliance-making, we argue that a TMT that is high on trust propensity
will tend to believe in the goodwill of the partners, and therefore perceive relatively low
relational risk. Therefore:
Proposition 1: A top management team with high trust propensity will tend to perceive
low relational risk in an alliance.
3.2.2. Locus of control
Locus of control refers to the degree to which individuals believe that their fate is
determined by their own abilities, or otherwise by external factors such as luck (Rotter, 1966).

<-----Page 10----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

11

People with an internal locus of control (``internals'') strongly believe in their self-efficacy,
tending to be proactive, whereas ``externals'' are more likely to be doubtful and restrained.
Scholars have found that locus of control is closely related to a decision-maker's risk
perception and risk taking (Bonoma and Johnston, 1979). Researchers have also identified a
close relationship between a strategy-maker's locus of control and strategy-making (Miller et
al., 1982). The perception of self-efficacy leads the internals to believe that if they do their
part of the job, things will be fine. Since internals are confident about their planning of the
alliance, they will perceive relatively low performance risk. In essence, we suggest a tight
relationship between internal locus of control, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived low
performance risk. Hence:
Proposition 2: A top management team with an internal locus of control will tend to
perceive low performance risk in an alliance.
3.2.3. Future orientation
The temporal aspects of management and organizational activities are being increasingly
recognized as deserving of critical study (Das, 1986, 1993). Individuals have distinctive
conceptions about the passage of time, and this psychological attribute influences their
planning activities. People differ on the extent to which they are able to project their view of
time-flow into the future. Future orientation refers to ``the psychological conceptions of the
future'' (Das, 1991, p. 51). In a study with a large sample of senior business executives, Das
(1987) found that those who have a distant-future orientation are more inclined toward
planning for longer horizons. In contrast, executives who are only comfortable with a future
close to the present, or are near-future-oriented, tended to plan for a relatively short period.
The future orientations of individual executives were found to have a significant role in
strategy-making and strategic planning. Individual future orientations have also been
conceptually integrated with the notion of risk horizons in strategic risk behavior (Das and
Teng, 1997, in press b).
In the case of strategic alliances, the length of the future that the strategists pay attention
to can influence their risk perceptions. Researchers emphasize the effect of ``the shadow of
the future'' in structuring alliances (Axelrod, 1984). According to some studies, the longer
the partners' time perspective Ð that is, the longer the shadow of the future Ð the less
likely the partners would behave opportunistically. Conversely, Joskow (1987) found that
more relationship-specific investments call for longer duration contracts Ð which presumably controls uncertainty in relationship. Obviously, foreseeable future interactions
reduce the partners' incentive to cheat, not only because opportunistic behavior is more
likely to be found out over the long haul, but also because an ongoing project can be
jeopardized out of an impulse to seek revenge. In view of this, we hypothesize that
strategy-makers with a distant-future orientation will be more able to foresee these future
interactions and therefore perceive more clearly the shadow of the future. Strategy-makers
who are near-future-oriented, in contrast, will not be able to envision these effects. Thus, a
TMT comprised of members with a distant-future orientation will tend to be preoccupied
with longer term co-operation. As a result, such a team will tend to be more optimistic

<-----Page 11----->12

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

about interfirm co-operation and, hence, will tend to perceive a relatively low level of
relational risk. Therefore:
Proposition 3: A TMT with a distant-future orientation will tend to perceive low
relational risk in an alliance.
Propositions 1, 2, and 3 have clear implications for selecting and training managers for
alliances. For example, managers with low trust propensity and a near-future orientation
would tend to be more conscious about relational risk. These managers should be assigned to
alliances that are expected to involve problems in partner co-operation. However, given the
tendency of these individuals to perceive high relational risk, it is necessary to train them
against being overly suspicious and preoccupied with short-term problems in co-operation.
3.3. Antecedents of risk perception: situational factors
Besides pyschological factors, the other antecedents of risk perception are situational
factors. As we noted earlier, research has thus far been inadequate in linking managerial
perceptions with objective factors in the external environment. Here we link strategists' risk
perceptions in strategic alliances with four situational factors: alliance history, partner
asymmetries, shared R&D efforts, and industry R&D intensity.
3.3.1. Alliance history
A prior history of co-operation between the partners is a valuable asset in strategic alliances.
Researchers suggest that repeated alliances between the same partners breed a sense of trust
(Gulati, 1995). Not only do the prior alliances serve as hostages deterring opportunistic
behavior on the part of either partner, but they also facilitate closer interactions between them.
The partners come to know each other better and their interdependence deepens. Under such
circumstances, firms find reason as well as emotion to believe in the goodwill of the other
partners. As compared to a first-time alliance, repeated alliances between known partners are
much safer psychologically in regard to potentially opportunistic behavior. Although the
potential for opportunism may indeed increase if too much trust is granted, at least the trustor
will have the benefit of basing that trust on a relatively long history of satisfactory cooperation, so that a perception of low relational risk will not be entirely unrealistic. Thus, we
can expect strategy-makers in repeated alliances to perceive a low relational risk. Hence:
Proposition 4: The greater the number of previous alliances between the same partners,
the lower will be the perceived relational risk.
3.3.2. Partner asymmetries
The relative size, resources, and market power of the partners can affect the risk
perceptions of strategy-makers. Alliances between equally strong, equally weak, or unequal
partners can be dramatically different in their alliance motives and structuring process. Oliver
(1990) observes that partner asymmetry Ð which allows one partner to exercise power and

<-----Page 12----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

13

control over another partner Ð is one of the key alliance motives. Along similar lines, Bleeke
and Ernst (1995) suggest that many stronger partners enter into an alliance with the hidden
agenda of ``capturing'' the weaker one. They also contend that alliances between unequal
partners are unlikely to be successful. In line with Osborn and Baughn's (1990) argument that
small firms are more vulnerable to their partners' opportunistic behavior, we reason that a
small partner firm will be even more vulnerable to a larger firm. Therefore, we propose that
partner asymmetries will lead the weak party to perceive relatively high relational risk.
A similar conclusion may be reached from a different perspective Ð the partners'
expectations about equitable treatment. We noted that the need to be treated fairly is an
important motive in any co-operative arrangement. Thus, a fair reward system is essential in
successful interorganizational relationships. We submit that, when partner asymmetries are
considerable, it will be especially difficult to construct a reward system that is perceived as
fair. The weaker party Ð that is, the party contributing less Ð will tend to perceive that it is
being exploited. In a sense, it seems that a 50±50 joint venture from which each parent firm
takes half of the rewards is more likely to be perceived as equitable. In this sense, we further
argue that, since trust is reciprocal, the weaker party's lack of confidence in co-operation may
trigger the stronger one to doubt the prospect of co-operation too. Thus, we suggest that
partner asymmetries contribute to a perception of high relational risk. Hence:
Proposition 5: The greater the asymmetries between the partners, the higher will be the
perceived relational risk.
3.3.3. Shared R&D efforts
Technological innovation represents the single most influential factor in forming strategic
alliances. Thus, many alliances are formed to conduct R&D jointly Ð generally referred to as
R&D alliances. However, the potentially most damaging problem in R&D alliances is that
shared R&D efforts provide a fertile ground for opportunistic behavior. The ambiguities
inherent in R&D activities make it difficult to assess the contributions of each partner Ð so
that shirking becomes commonplace. In fact, the ambiguities inherent in interfirm exchange
and transfer of any intangible resources (such as knowledge and capabilities) suggest higher
relational risk. Moreover, Hamel (1991) observes that R&D alliances may be a cover for
secretly capturing other partners' superior technology. This risk of unintentional loss of
control of the technology through a poorly constructed agreement is easily appreciated. Thus,
the partners about to join R&D alliances are likely to be concerned about opportunistic
behavior, and therefore perceive high relational risk. Hence:
Proposition 6: Strategy-makers are likely to perceive high relational risk in an alliance if
the partners share R&D efforts.
3.3.4. Industry R&D intensity
R&D intensity in an industry represents an important factor in understanding the industry
as well as the strategies adopted by the players. Researchers report that alliances in high-tech

<-----Page 13----->14

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

industries are more likely to be nonequity contract-based, because strategic flexibility is
especially important in these industries (Hagedoorn and Narula, 1996; Osborn and Baughn,
1990). It follows that high-tech industries connote higher performance risk for firms. On the
one hand, R&D activities are known to be risky because they involve developing new
approaches that are exploratory in nature. On the other hand, because intense R&D activities
lead to expedited technological changes in an industry, industries with high R&D intensity are
more turbulent and therefore more risky compared to other industries. In R&D-intensive
industries, the rules of the competitive game may not be well-developed, as firms try to be
innovative and develop new ways of doing business. Uncertainties and risks in industries like
telecommunications and biotechnology are usually greater than those industries with more
mature technologies, such as the steel industry. Thus, we argue that in R&D-intensive
industries, performance risk is likely to be perceived as high. Hence:
Proposition 7: In industries with high R&D intensity, the performance risk of an
alliance will tend to be perceived as high.
Because relational risk and performance risk are affected by various situational factors,
partner firms may control the level of risk by selecting and altering the alliance context. For
example, a firm may reduce relational risk by selecting those partners that are of similar size
and market power, and those that it knew through previous alliances. It may also reduce
shared R&D efforts in the alliance. In addition to psychological and situational factors, an
important mechanism to control risks in alliances is alliance structure. In the following
sections, we discuss the role of alliance structure in controlling risks in alliances.
3.4. Types of alliance structures
We mentioned earlier that strategic alliances can take a variety of forms Ð including, but
not limited to, joint ventures, minority equity alliances, R&D contracts, joint R&D, joint
production, joint marketing and promotion, enhanced supplier partnership, distribution
agreements, and licensing agreements. We list in Table 1 brief descriptions of the most
typical alliance types.
For the purpose of better organizing such a large collection of alliance forms, theorists
have proposed several typologies of strategic alliances (e.g., Oliver, 1990). Both Killing
(1988) and Yoshino and Rangan (1995) identify three major types of alliances: nontraditional
contracts (nonequity-based), minority equity alliances, and joint ventures. Lorange and Roos
(1990) differentiate four archetypes of alliances Ð ad hoc pool, consortium, project-based
joint venture, and full-blown joint venture. In addition, Ring and Van de Ven (1992)
distinguish recurrent contracting and relational contracting. Dussauge and Garrette (1995)
propose four types of alliances along a continuum from market to hierarchy: R&D agreement,
unstructured co-production projects, semistructured projects, and business-based joint ventures. Yet another typology consists of the following four: contractual without shared risk/
reward, contractual with shared risk/reward, minority equity, and joint ventures.
None of these typologies have been widely accepted in the literature. On the one hand, some
of them do not exhaust all possible alliance forms. For example, Dussauge and Garrette's

Common types of strategic alliances
Alliance type

Description

(1) Joint venture
(2) Minority equity alliance

A separately incorporated entity jointly owned by the partners.
The terms of the alliance include an acquisition of equity
shares, by either one or more partners.
The partners share manufacturing responsibilities and supply
each other with products that are marketed by the partners under
their own brand names (Yoshino and Rangan, 1995, p. 135).
The partners market the same product under the same or different
brand names.
The partners combine their R&D efforts and share the rights to
the product/service.
The supplier not only provides a particular type or line of
goods/services, but also becomes an integral part of buyer's
operation through extensive cooperation. A higher level of
reciprocal interdependence than the traditional buyer-supplier
relationship (Borys and Jemison, 1989, p. 246).
One partner provides funds to another partner for specified
R&D activities, and in return receives or shares market rights
to the resulting product/service.
An agreement ``by which one firm buys the right to use an asset
for a period of time . . ., typically involve a narrow purpose and
limited time frame, . . .'' (Borys and Jemison, 1989, p. 245).

(3a) Joint production
(3b) Joint marketing and promotion
(3c) Joint R&D
(3d) Enhanced supplier partnership

(4a) R&D contract
(4b) Licensing agreement

(1995) list leaves out quite a few types of alliances. On the other hand, some typologies do not
offer clear linkages with common types of alliance forms, such as the typology suggested by
Lorange and Roos (1990). As a result, most studies on alliance structural choice have thus far
been based on the dichotomy of equity alliances vs. nonequity alliances. Whereas equity
alliances include joint ventures and minority equity alliances, nonequity alliances refer to all
other cooperative arrangements that do not involve equity exchange.
We believe that the attempt to explain alliance structural choices should reflect the
complexities and variations of alliance structures beyond the equity±nonequity dichotomy.
To that end, we suggest equity and nonequity alliances should both be examined for further
refinements. For equity alliances, clearly, the two substantive components are joint ventures
and minority equity alliances. For nonequity alliances, we may differentiate between
unilateral contract-based alliances and bilateral contract-based alliances.
Alliances are unilateral contract-based when there are well-defined transfer of property
rights, such as in licensing agreements. Licensing, distribution agreements, and R&D
contracts are the main forms of unilateral contract-based alliances. The key feature of these
alliances is that individual firms carry out their obligations independently of each other. Such
contracts tend to be complete and specific, and partners are expected to perform on their own
accordingly Ð without much coordination or collaboration. Thus, the level of integration is
relatively low in unilateral contract-based alliances.
Bilateral contract-based alliances involve the sustained joint creation of property and
knowledge for the partners, requiring them to bring in resources and work together on a

<-----Page 15----->16

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

constant basis. Some examples of bilateral contract-based alliances include joint R&D, joint
marketing and promotion, enhanced supplier partnership, and joint production. These
alliances require partners to put in resources and work together constantly, so that partners
are integrated in a fairly tight manner. As compared to unilateral contracts, bilateral contracts
are usually incomplete and more open-ended. To some extent, partners of bilateral contractbased alliances have to let the cooperative relationship unfold itself.
We propose a new and comprehensive typology of alliance structures consisting of four
kinds of alliances: unilateral contract-based alliances, bilateral contract-based alliances,
minority equity alliances, and joint ventures. This typology is preferred over others for
two reasons. First, these four types exhaust all possible forms of alliance structures, because
the first two cover all nonequity alliances and the latter two include all equity alliances.
Second, these four types are unambiguously defined, so that any particular alliance can be
clearly identified as belonging to one of the four. We list the key distinguishing characteristics
of the four alliance structures in Table 2.
Based on the logic of transaction cost economics, the four types fall along the continuum
from market to hierarchy. It is apparent that unilateral contract-based alliances are the closest
to market transactions, while joint ventures are akin to hierarchical governance. Here we
adopt the four-part alliance structural typology and explain the choices among the four types
of structures in terms of risk perceptions.
3.5. Alliance structural preferences and risk perceptions
The risk perception model essentially suggests that the structural choice among the four
types can be explained in terms of (1) each partner's perceptions of relational risk and
performance risk about a prospective strategic alliance as they engage in (2) bargaining with
their other partners about the desirable structure on the basis of these initial risk perceptions.
Some may, however, argue that under certain circumstances, the alliance structure is not a
choice but a mandate. For example, countries sometimes specify the kind of alliances that will
be allowed (such as a minority position in joint ventures for multinational firms). We submit
that such situations are becoming less common, and certainly not the trend in today's
globalizing economy. Some may also argue that the structure of an alliance is largely
determined by the purposes of the partners Ð e.g., market entry or joint research Ð so that
the structure is not a real choice available to the partners. In our view, the choice among
various governance structures is real, since alternative alliance structures can be used to
achieve the same strategic objectives. Although strategic motivation is important, its
importance can vary with the contractual form of the alliance. Thus, as Yoshino and Rangan
(1995, p. 81) observe: ``We want to know why different partners in the same industry,
engaged in essentially the same type of activities, choose different alliance structures.'' For
example, in the case of new product development, one firm can either fund its partner to
conduct research or invest through equity acquisition. The British entertainment company
Thorn-EMI formed an alliance with L.M. Ericksson (a Swedish telecommunications
company) with the objective of exploring the British telecommunications market (Lewis,
1992). Given this objective, there was concern about the relational risk of the deal Ð that is,
Ericksson may well decide to enter the market later on its own. As such, Thorn-EMI insisted

on having a 51±49 joint venture, in addition to having a veto power on major decisions of the
alliance. As this case shows, the structural choice of an alliance is not predetermined by the
purpose of the alliance. Given certain objectives in the alliance, managers will still be in a
position to choose from alternative structures.
We now turn to a discussion highlighting the distinction among the four structural options
by examining relational risk and performance risk inherent in a prospective strategic alliance.
The basic assumption is that firms will want to control the level of total risk they are exposed
to. Yates and Stone (1992) suggest that the total risk is the sum of various risk elements. In
strategic alliances, that means that partners will attempt to control the level of total risk
(relational risk + performance risk) of an alliance. One mechanism for such control is the
choice of alliance structure, which may either mitigate or add to the risk level. Thus, the
rational choice of an alliance structure should keep the total risk level of the alliance from
being inordinately high. We should note here that no particular alliance structure is
necessarily better than other alliance structures Ð the key lies in the match between the
specific risk conditions and the structural choice. Risk conditions refer to the perceived risk
levels (relational and performance) of a cooperative deal before any negotiated decisions are
made about the mutually acceptable alliance structure. For example, if the initial performance
risk level of a projected joint effort is believed by a prospective partner to be high, then a
structure that can effectively control that high performance risk will be the desired by that
partner while going into the negotiation phase with the other partners. We use this logic as the
foundation for the discussion of the preference for each alliance structure (see Fig. 2).
3.5.1. Joint ventures
Joint ventures are separately incorporated entities created and shared by the partners. Thus,
in the continuum of alliance forms, they are the closest to hierarchical organizations. We
suggest that they will be preferred when both relational risk and performance risk are perceived
to be low. The logic is that joint ventures as a structural choice are ineffective in dealing with
relational risk and performance risk. Thus, the choice of joint ventures among the four
structural alternatives is appropriate when relational risk and performance risk are both low.
Regarding relational risk, joint ventures are recognized as fertile grounds for unintended
knowledge transfers. One of the motives in entering into an alliance is the capture of other
partners' superior knowledge and technology. However, unlike a technology transfer

19

agreement (e.g., licensing), firms work closely with each other in joint ventures, and the
ventures can easily become a cover for secretly capturing other partners' technology. When
partners cooperate in a joint venture, they are significantly exposed to each other in terms of
their tacit knowledge, technology, and other valuable resources. Thus, some partners may
unintendedly lose control of their core competence through ineffectively designed joint
ventures. Many alliances eventually suffer an unplanned termination after one partner
acquires its needed knowledge from the other partners. In addition, joint ventures sometimes
serve as a stepping stone for those who intend to take over the partner. In this sense, having an
equity joint venture with others imposes significant relational risk for the firm itself. Also, the
more difficult it is to protect one's proprietary know-how, the more risk is involved in an
equity joint venture.
Furthermore, choosing joint ventures usually means adding significantly to performance
risk, which refers to the hazards (both the probability and the severity of consequences) of an
alliance failure. First, joint ventures require investing in the creation of a separate entity. Some
additional investments are necessary to get it started. A separate organization has to be set up,
including constituting a board of directors, staffing senior level managers, securing office
space, and so on. These costs may not be needed if the alliance is formed through other forms Ð
e.g., joint production Ð in which case each party can utilize what they already have to the
maximum. Because of these additional investments needed to create new entities, joint ventures
are often exposed to higher performance risk as compared to other forms of strategic alliances.
Second, joint ventures are separately created entities based on shared equity ownership, so
that possible losses from a failing joint venture tend to be high. On the one hand, much of the
investments in joint ventures cannot be easily recovered for other uses in the event the
alliance has to be terminated. On the other hand, since partners are more deeply embedded in
joint ventures, it will be a rather prolonged and difficult process to separate or exit. Should an
alliance fail, it would be much more costly to end an equity joint venture than a licensing
agreement. Clearly, joint ventures by their very nature imply very high exit costs.
Finally, high performance risk for joint ventures also comes from their high governance
costs. Not only does shared ownership sacrifice strategic flexibility of the firm, organizational
cultural differences also make joint decision-making and implementation even more difficult.
In other alliance types, by comparison, less joint decision-making is necessary because each
party is supposed to behave in accordance with the contractual agreements.
In sum, as compared to other alliance forms, joint ventures cannot effectively deal with
relational risk and performance risk. Therefore, they will be preferred only if both the
relational risk and the performance risk of a prospective alliance are low. Hence:
Proposition 8: Partner firms that perceive low relational risk and low performance risk
in a prospective alliance will prefer an equity joint venture.
3.5.2. Minority equity alliances
This type of alliance means taking equity positions in one or more partners, without
creating a new legal entity. For instance, firms may enter into a licensing agreement and also
have an equity acquisition. Minority equity alliances are considered effective in dealing with

<-----Page 19----->20

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

opportunistic behavior, or controlling relational risk. Two arguments can be advanced for this
position. First, shared ownership aligns the interests and incentives of parent firms. As long as
each parent firm has its own stake Ð or ``mutual hostage'' in the venture Ð the incentive to
behave opportunistically will be restrained.
The second argument is that opportunistic behavior stems mainly from performance
ambiguity. To that end, minority equity alliances seem to ``provide a mechanism for
distributing residuals when ex ante contractual agreements cannot be written to specify or
enforce a division of returns'' (Teece, 1992, p. 20). Thus, opportunistic behavior will be
discouraged. Of course, equity investments do not always determine one's share of alliance
payoff. Partner firms may use agreements such as buy-back arrangements to modify the
distribution of payoffs. The utility of equity investments, however, is in providing a basic
structure when other distribution mechanisms are not clearly available. In sum, a minority
equity governance structure is useful in controlling relational risk inherent in an alliance, and
therefore, should be preferred when relational risk is perceived as high. It seems that joint
ventures would also have the two mechanisms that lower relational risk: incentive alignment
based on shared ownership, and a payoff distribution structure. The difference lies in the
additional relational risk introduced by joint ventures: possible opportunism facilitated by
partners working together under the same roof. It is this extra relational risk that renders
minority equity alliances more acceptable than joint ventures in high relational risk situations.
On the other hand, minority equity alliances are not effective in controlling performance
risk. In fact, they often add to the level of performance risk. First, ending an alliance when
firms have equity stakes in their partners is a fairly complicated task. Partners have to decide
on procedures for equity ownership to be withdrawn Ð which often prolongs the termination
of the alliance. Because of these additional costs involved in ending alliances when things go
sour, performance risk can be high.
Secondly, minority equity alliances also tend to incur high governance costs. Shared
ownership implies shared decision-making and split control Ð which complicates the process
and reduces strategic flexibility of the firm (Harrigan, 1988; Killing, 1988). In nonequity
alliances, by comparison, there is less need for joint decision-making because each party is
expected to behave in accordance with contractual agreements. As a result, minority equity
alliances are feasible only when performance risk is perceived as low.
Minority equity alliances can effectively control the total risk level when relational risk is
perceived as high and performance risk as low. Parkhe (1993) found some support for the
hypothesis that a perceived fear of increased opportunistic behavior leads to more nonrecoverable, or equity, investments. Shan (1991) found that foreign companies were less willing
to invest equity when country-specific risk, or performance risk, was perceived as high. Thus:
Proposition 9: Partner firms that perceive high relational risk and low performance risk
in a prospective alliance will prefer a minority equity alliance.
3.5.3. Bilateral contract-based alliances
Unlike minority equity alliances, contract-based alliances do not involve any equity and
ownership transfer. Some specific forms of bilateral contract-based alliances include joint

<-----Page 20----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

21

production, joint marketing and promotion, and joint R&D. These arrangements can be
combined with ownership exchange and thus become ``minority equity alliances.'' Since the
two options differ in terms of equity ownership, the decision will be based on the question of
the kind of risk that needs to be controlled Ð relational risk or performance risk.
We argued earlier that minority equity alliances are effective in controlling relational risk,
but not performance risk. In contrast, bilateral contract-based alliances are more effective in
dealing with performance risk, but not with relational risk. First, because shared ownership
helps limit opportunistic behavior, a lack of shared ownership will make it difficult to restrain
such behavior. Partner firms may rely on contractual agreements and institutional mechanisms to encourage responsible behavior. For example, reciprocal agreements may specify that
further collaboration is contingent upon satisfactory initial co-operation. Nevertheless, the
point is that it is simply more difficult to align partner's interests and to distribute residual
benefits of the alliance without shared ownership. Beyond areas clearly specified by the
contracts, contract-based alliances rely heavily on the goodwill, reputation, and voluntary cooperation from independent firms. Nevertheless, such trust is not easy to come by and is
associated with a number of conditions Ð such as a history of successful engagements.
Contractual safeguards, moreover, are both costly to prepare and implement and also
potentially detrimental to the spirit of co-operation.
Secondly, bilateral contract-based alliances can be useful in better coping with high
performance risk situations. As compared to joint ventures and minority equity alliances,
bilateral contract-based alliances are much more flexible, which means they are easier to
restructure, modify, or terminate. Because there is no transfer of equity or ownership, partners
in such an alliance can easily withdraw from it. Explaining their choice of alliance structure,
one manager noted that ``why should we lock ourselves into an equity-based alliance when
we can retain the strategic flexibility of moving to a different structure as the technology and
our strategy evolve?'' (Yoshino and Rangan, 1995, p. 81). Since equity investments would
make partners more deeply embedded in the alliance, the performance risk of the alliance will
increase in consequence.
In sum, bilateral contract-based alliances are appropriate for reducing performance risk, but
not relational risk. Thus, they are most preferred when performance risk is perceived as high
and relational risk is perceived as low. Hence:
Proposition 10: Partner firms that perceive low relational risk and high performance risk
in a prospective alliance will prefer it to be bilateral contract-based.
3.5.4. Unilateral contract-based alliances
Unilateral contract-based alliances include licensing, subcontracting, distribution agreements, and other cooperative contracts that involve clear exchange of property rights. R&D
contracts in which one partner performs R&D activities specified and funded by another
partner are a good example of this type of alliance. As compared to bilateral contract-based
alliances, the key characteristic of unilateral contract-based alliances is partners' limited
engagement. In licensing, subcontracting, and R&D contracts, partners are independent
entities, which implement their part of the contractual agreement. For example, in licensing

<-----Page 21----->22

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

agreements, the licensee essentially purchases the right to use the licensor's property rights on
a limited basis, so that the level of interdependence is relatively low. As a result, strategic
flexibility is their distinct advantage. However, this flexibility maybe limited if partner firms
emphasize exclusivity in licensing.
Since partners are minimally engaged in unilateral contract-based alliances, they would be
preferred by partners when both relational risk and performance risk of a prospective alliance
are high. First, a high level of relational risk indicates the potential for opportunistic behavior
and other factors that may jeopardize satisfactory co-operation. Thus, a high level of interfirm
engagement Ð as in an equity joint venture Ð is not advisable in such situations. Apparently,
unintended technology dissemination, shirking, and culture clash become severe problems
when partners are engaged at more substantial levels Ð such as in the case of joint R&D and
joint production (bilateral contract-based). By comparison, in alliances such as those
involving R&D contracts partners do not work closely with each other, so that a high
relational risk seems somewhat less threatening. Nevertheless, this does not imply that such
alliances are immune from relational risk. For example, firms involved in licensing agreements may still face problems such as misappropriation of licensed intellectual properties.
Second, when the performance risk of an alliance is perceived as high, the potential for
failing in the enterprise can be considerable. In this case, unilateral contract-based
alliances are to be preferred because of the ease with which it can be terminated.
Licensing, subcontracting, and R&D contracts represent a flexible approach because these
can be easily halted if things go sour. As such, the potential consequences of high
performance risk can be deliberately circumscribed. By comparison, minority equity
alliances are more costly to negotiate a termination. It is also possible that one firm
may take advantage of its partner in such equity buyouts. In sum, unilateral contractbased alliances form the most flexible structure, and they will be preferred when the
relational risk and the performance risk are too high for forging more embedded forms of
alliances. Thus:
Proposition 11: Partner firms that perceive high relational risk and high performance
risk in a prospective alliance will prefer it to be unilateral contract-based.
The basic idea undergirding the risk perception model is that various alliance structures
have very different effects on relational risk and performance risk of the alliance. Thus,
structural choices of alliances should allow partners to better control the total level of the two
types of risk. Joint ventures add much relational risk and performance risk to the alliance, so
that they will be preferred only if both types of risk are perceived as low. Minority equity
alliances are effective in controlling relational risk but not performance risk, so that they are
most feasible in situations with high relational risk and low performance risk. Contrariwise,
bilateral contract-based alliances lack adequate control over relational risk but involve less
performance risk, so that they are preferred when relational risk is low and performance risk
is high. Finally, unilateral contract-based alliances allow partners to assume minimal
relational risk and performance risk. As a result, they are the optimal structural choice when
the risk levels are too high for other alliance forms. When managers follow the normative

<-----Page 22----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

23

approach delineated in Propositions 8±11, the effectiveness of risk control in alliances will be
enhanced. The risk perception model offers a systematic and yet simple way to make sound
structural decisions in alliances.
It needs to be noted that there are other fine-grained components in alliance structural
arrangements, including mechanisms such as veto rights, exit clauses, lawsuit clauses,
arbitration clauses, and accounting and monitoring measures. Although these components
do not change alliance types, they offer important means to fine-tune the alliance structure.
For example, partner firms may use veto rights and exit clauses in joint ventures to further
reduce relational risk and performance risk. When exit procedures and terms are negotiated
up front, the possible termination of joint ventures can become less costly and smoother.
Besides, partner firms may install strict control and monitoring measures to further reduce the
risks. Performance risk can be reduced when firms develop detailed procedures to improve
coordination and control outputs. Relational risk can be reduced when measures are
developed to prevent shirking, cheating, appropriating resources, and other opportunistic
behavior. In sum, these additional structural arrangements can be used to supplement or
modify the basic governance structure of an alliance.
So far we have discussed alliance structural preferences based on a risk perception model.
However, the partners' preferences of governance structure is only the first step toward
actually reaching an alliance arrangement, because the partners are likely to develop differing
perceptions of the two kinds of risk. Therefore, in reference to Fig. 1, divergent structural
preferences would need to be resolved.
3.6. Structural preference resolution
In strategic alliances, the partners often have different kinds of risk perceptions and thus
prefer different governance structures. Osborn and Baughn (1990, p. 509) suggest that ``the
governance form of a co-operative alliance needs to satisfy both parties involved.'' However,
should prospective partners differ in their preferences as between equity and nonequity
alliance, they have only two options. In the first option, no prospective partner is willing to
compromise Ð in which event there would be no alliance. In the second, one firm backs off
and accepts the partner's choice. In this second option, partners' preferences are likely to be
resolved as one party eventually exercises its power and determines the choice. Researchers
generally agree that bargaining and negotiation are essential elements in the formation of
strategic alliances. Of course, not all partners have to go through the same explicit bargaining
process. For instance, when firms are embedded in a network or in an ongoing partnership,
the need to negotiate each time may not be as great, and the firms may well be willing to rely
on mutual forbearance and even to sacrifice some short-term interests in the process.
Nevertheless, resolution will still take place, although probably in a more subtle and
principled way, because there will almost always be some differences to be resolved. The
way firms resolve their differences may vary greatly from case to case, but the essence would
remain the same Ð to get what you want without giving in too much.
Gomes-Casseres (1990, p. 2; emphases in original) notes that we need not only to know
``what ownership structure does the firm want,'' but also ``what ownership structure can the
firm get.'' To view the formation of strategic alliances as a bargaining process, researchers

<-----Page 23----->24

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

have developed the negotiations model, which uses the term ``bargaining power'' as a key
predictive concept. Bargaining power here is a subjective notion because it has to do with the
perceptions of the parties about the various sources Ð such as stake, alternatives, and
committed resources.
Preference resolution can be viewed as a process in which negotiators' bargaining power is
wielded and manipulated to achieve a favorable agreement. By definition, bargaining power
refers to ``the extent to which one partner can favorably change the bargaining set . . . and can
win accommodations from the other'' (Gray and Yan, 1992, p. 49). The resolution outcomes,
naturally, are dependent on the contrast between the parties' respective bargaining power. The
more bargaining power one possesses, the more likely one's opinion will be accepted.
In this article, we integrate the bargaining power concept into our risk perception model.
In the area of strategic alliances, studies Ð mostly from the resource-dependence perspective
Ð indicate that the exercise of power (or bargaining power in our terminology) is a key
aspect of strategic alliances (Provan and Gassenheimer, 1994). Moreover, scholars have
successfully employed the concept of bargaining power in predicting the parent firms'
ownership structure in joint ventures (Blodgett, 1991; Gomes-Casseres, 1990). Lecraw
(1984), for example, found that the more bargaining power the transnational corporations
have, the higher the equity ownership they managed to get. Thus, we suggest that the
structural preference of the party with relatively more bargaining power will prevail,
assuming the alliance is actually formed. Hence:
Proposition 12: The more relative bargaining power a partner firm possesses, the more
likely that its own preference will determine the governance structure of the alliance.
Although using bargaining power to predict structural agreements in alliances is not a new
idea, our intent here is to apply its logic to alliance structural choice making. As a result, we
have a process model of alliance structuring Ð which helps us in understanding the process
by which individual firms' evaluation of alliances eventually leads to their agreed structural
outcome. The bargaining process delineated here may seem somewhat positional Ð that is,
negotiators insisting on bargaining relative to their original positions without being creative or
flexible. However, we are not ruling out the so-called principled approach Ð in which
negotiators may trade their positions for other interests. While it is certainly possible that
some firms may sacrifice their structural preference for other kinds of gains, we argue in our
proposition that on the whole, partners with more bargaining power will tend to prevail on
this point of structural choice. Ring and Van de Ven (1994) note that a congruence of
expectations and assumptions emerge as a result of repeated interactions in the negotiation
process Ð and our model highlights the reconciliation aspect of such negotiations. Indeed,
our model encompasses those situations in which the partners are unable to develop a
congruent structural preference through informal sensemaking. Of course, if the preferences
among the parties happen to be more or less congruent, the formal bargaining encounters
would be relatively routine.
For alliance managers, our model suggests that they should be very conscious about their
respective bargaining power in the entire alliance formation process. Managers should realize

<-----Page 24----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

25

that in alliances, one cannot always have one's way. In particular, firms with low bargaining
power should know that they need to be flexible and creative in the negotiation process.
Therefore, more contingent approaches should be formulated in designing the alliance.
4. Concluding remarks
In discussing strategic alliances, we began by noting that we need to understand both the
structural preferences of the partners and the resolution of those preferences. We attempted in
this article to proceed along these two fronts by presenting a risk perception model with a
bargaining component. Following the tradition of strategy process studies, we described in
our model the process of strategic alliance structuring that assigns a significant role for
decision-makers in terms of their perceptions. After all, if managerial perceptions function
like a filter on the objective environment, then to a large extent the nature of the subsequent
organizational processes and the eventual decision outcomes will be influenced by the nature
of that filter. The role of managerial risk perceptions in our model brings us closer to the
actual process of strategic decision-making. We thus provided a more realistic perspective on
the strategic alliance structuring process. In brief, the first contribution of this model is an
elaboration of the ways in which the partners come to form their structural preferences.
The second contribution of the model is in making the resolution of structural preferences
an essential part of the alliance-making process and suggesting specific linkages between
bargaining power and structural outcomes. In this way, our model recognizes the interplay
between prospective partners. Most studies treat the two or more partners in an alliance as a
single unit for purposes of analysis. As a result, the differences among the partners have not
received due recognition in the major perspectives on strategic alliances. In contrast, we
stressed the nature of the alliance-making process in terms of interfirm interactions. The
reconciliation of different opinions and objectives is an indispensable component of a
process-oriented model of strategic alliance-making. By integrating the bargaining power
perspective, the model takes into account the initial divergence of structural preferences
among prospective alliance partners.
Third, our risk perception model also highlighted the distinction between strategic alliancemaking and other strategic maneuvers. The perception of relational risk among the partners is
a unique characteristic of strategic alliances, and deserves further exploration. While the risk
perception model sets alliances apart form all single-firm strategies, most theories of alliances
(e.g., strategic behavior and resource-dependence) regard alliances as merely one more
strategic option, whether it is for gaining an advantageous competitive position or for
managing dependence relationships. Thus, the uniqueness of alliances is not adequately
recognized. Also, whereas transaction cost economics does emphasize the difference between
hierarchies and alliances, our risk perception model differs significantly in that it has a
process orientation and is focused on risk rather than cost. Accordingly, our model may
suggest different or even competing predictions from those generated by other theories. For
example, the transaction cost perspective suggests that shared R&D activities increase
transaction costs so that the alliances will tend to be equity-based. In contrast, the risk
model views shared R&D activities as a high relational risk situation, and thus, alliances can

<-----Page 25----->26

T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

be formed as either unilateral contract-based (when the performance risk is considered
relatively high, such as in R&D contracts) or with minority equity investment (when the
performance risk is considered relatively low, such as in joint R&D with equity participation).
Fourth, certain troublesome issues in strategic alliances can be more easily comprehended
with this risk model. We demonstrated how the structural choice of alliances can be explained
by adopting the risk perception perspective. We also commented on several issues Ð such as
alliance history, partner asymmetries, and industry R&D intensity Ð that previous scholars
attempted to deal with from other perspectives. In our model, the relationships between these
variables and alliance structural preferences are more straightforward and parsimonious. The
risk perception perspective also allows us to explore several psychological aspects of alliancemaking that have not been touched upon thus far. These relationships Ð as delineated in our
propositions Ð should also help us appreciate more fully the subjective side of strategymaking as it pertains to strategic alliances. Having relational risk and performance risk as the
core concepts, various elements in the competitive environment now find their due place in
the process of alliance structuring.
Of course, there are also other issues that are not covered in the current framework, such as
various types of resource needs and the fit between the partners. Another limitation of the risk
perception model is that our discussion of the risk perception antecedents is not exhaustive.
We selected some of the more significant psychological and situational factors and discussed
them in terms of their impact on risk perception. A more comprehensive list of antecedents is
perhaps warranted. Third, risk perception is but one perspective in understanding alliance
structuring. It would be desirable to integrate other theoretical perspectives as well. For
instance, an integration of the risk perspective and the cost perspective could lead to
interesting insights.
The risk perception model has several implications for future research. First, empirical
testing can be carried out to compare the explanatory power of this process model vis-a-vis
other content-based models. Second, since our model has incorporated an additional decisionmaking element in the logic of structural determination Ð which is proposed mainly by
transaction cost economics Ð we expect empirical results to show that more variance in
structural outcomes can be explained by risk perceptions than by factors like alliance history.
Third, because the value of differentiating relational risk and performance risk in strategic
alliances may go well beyond structural choice, future research could also look into other
applications such as the rationale for alliance formation, alliance performance, and the
evolving alliance process.
Finally, from the perspective of managers, the model proposed here explicitly recognizes
that the perceptions of strategy-makers substantively influence strategic decisions. To be more
specific, we suggested that executives, consciously or unconsciously, tend to make decisions
based on their evaluation of two distinct types of risk in alliances: relational risk and
performance risk. Our earlier discussion indicated that this approach is a fairly rational one
for the decision-maker. Therefore, our model is not merely descriptive in nature Ð it also has
clear normative implications. Strategy-makers will benefit by consciously analyzing relational risk and performance risk in each situation. The key difference between the two kinds
of risk lies in the nature of the problem Ð namely, whether it is about intentions or
capabilities. If a potential problem can be attributed to a lack of goodwill and commitment, it

<-----Page 26----->T.K. Das, B. Teng / Journal of International Management 7 (2001) 1±29

27

will be related to relational risk. In contrast, if poor alliance performance can be ascribed to a
lack of competence to succeed in the competitive environment, it will be related to
performance risk. These two concepts should facilitate marshaling the thinking processes
of executives in complex alliance-making situations. Strategy-makers need also to be aware
of the biases in their perceptions of the alliance-making environment. The three cognitive
characteristics that have been identified as the antecedents of risk perception indicate that
personal attributes are salient in decision-making concerning alliance structuring. Obviously,
different decision-makers will have different perceptions of the environment. Thus, the model
also serves to underscore the fact that placing a particular decision-maker in charge of a
strategic alliance-making project will condition the kind of risk assessment that will be made
about that alliance.
