Process Descriptions of Decision Making
OLA SVENSON

University of Stockholm
This paper introduces a representation system for the description of decision
alternatives and decision rules. Examples of these decision rules, classified
according to their metric requirements (i.e., metric level, commensurability
across dimensions, and lexicographic ordering) in the system, are given. A
brief introduction to process tracing techniques is followed by a review of
results reported in process tracing studies of decision making. The review
shows that most decision problems are solved without a complete search of
information, which shows that many of the algebraic models of decision making are inadequate. When the number of aspects of a decision situation is
constant, an increase in the number of alternatives (and a corresponding decrease in the number of dimensions) leads to a greater number of investigated
aspects. Verbal protocols showed that decision rules belonging to the different
groups were used by decision makers when making a choice. It was concluded
that process tracing data can be fruitfully used in studies of decision making
but that such data do not release the researcher from the burden of constructing theories or models in relation to which the data must then be analyzed.

It is gradually becoming clear that human decision making cannot be
understood simply by studying final decisions. The perceptual, emotional,
and cognitive process which ultimately lead to the choice of a decision
alternative must also be studied if we want to gain an adequate understanding of human decision making. Therefore, this paper will focus on
the dynamic process in which a decision maker seeks and evaluates information sequentially. Unfortunately, there are still very few studies
which have been focused on the decision process as such and where
process tracing techniques have been used (cf. Slovic, Fischhoff, &
Lichtenstein, 1977). The theoretical basis for process tracing studies is
still evolving, and the research has so far been mainly devoted to a descriptive approach to decision making processes. The need for theory in
the field is great. Lacking such theory, the present paper starts by introducing a representation system for describing decision alternatives and
decision rules. After this follow examples of decision rules which are
possible candidates for use in decision processes. The rules are classified
in different groups, depending on which requirements they place on the

cognitive representation of choice alternatives and on information processing. After the presentation of this framework, methods for studying decision processes are discussed. Results typically found in process tracing
studies are then presented. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of
some of the issues related to studies of decision processes.

REPRESENTATION OF DECISION ALTERNATIVES
In the following, we assume that a decision maker's subjective representation of the choice alternatives may be described by reference to a
number of dimensions or attributes. More specifically, it is assumed that
each possible outcome of a decision may be characterized by a set of
aspects. The aspects correspond to values on a set of dimensions or
attributes. The subjective representation system corresponds to an objective description of the decision situation not treated here. An aspect
stands for a subjective entity located on an attribute, e.g., the subjective
experience of the price or size of an apartment, the color of a car, the
probability of winning on a lottery ticket, or the probability of dying in an
accident. However, when choices are made between decision alternatives, the subjective representation (of, e.g., size or color) is not interesting per se. Rather, what determines the choice is the degree of attractiveness associated with each aspect characterizing the alternatives. Therefore, it is assumed that each aspect may be mapped on a scale of attractiveness. There is one and only one scale of attractiveness associated with
an attribute. From now on the aspects will be denoted only by numbers on
the scales of attractiveness of the attributes. For example, an apartment
will be represented neither by its objective size nor by its subjective size,
but by a number denoting its degree of attractiveness on the attribute of
size. In the same way the apartment will also be characterized by attractiveness values on other attributes, such as rent and surroundings. Thus,
an aspect mentioned in the following always refers to the attractiveness of
the aspect.
In the simplest case, only rank order relations are defined among the
aspects of different alternatives on an attribute. For instance, if you want
to buy the cheapest rain coat you can get in a foreign city (assuming it is
raining and that you have an excellent one at home), a rank order representation of the raincoats' different degrees of attractiveness on the
attribute of price will suffice. In general, the metric level of representation
of the aspects on an attribute may range from ordinal to interval to ratio
scale level.
The representation of the attractiveness of the aspects may or may
not imply commensurability across attributes. Take the example of a man
choosing an apartment. If he thinks that the values of an aspect on the
attribute of noise may, in one way or another, be combined with an

<-----Page 2----->88

OLA SVENSON

attractiveness value on the size attribute, then the representation is commensurate across attributes. If he does not think he can integrate the
aspects of noise and size, then the representation will not be commensurate between these attributes when he makes a decision.
The following is an explanation of the notation to be used. A decision
alternative A~ is characterized by a set of aspects (ail, ai2 . . . . . a~,), where
the first subscript indicates alternative; the second subscript, attribute;
and n, the total number of attributes. Note that the symbol aiR, k = 1, n,
denotes the degree of attractiveness of aspect k and no other subjective
entity. An alternative refers to a possible outcome of a decision. Thus,
certain and uncertain outcomes will not be differentiated in this paper.
Information about the likelihood of an outcome is regarded as an aspect
on the attribute of belief or subjective probability (cf. Wendt, 1975).
In most experiments, where process descriptions of decision making
have been collected, the choice alternatives were characterized by numbers or other information on a set of variables or attributes (e.g., Payne,
1976; Payne & Braunstein, Note 7). Thus, most investigations have assumed a priori that the decision alternatives were represented in a multidimensional subjective space. Svenson (Note 10) attempted to construct
a representation system from think aloud protocols collected for choices
among a number of homes. The analysis showed that the alternatives
could easily be described in a multiattribute representation system. However, the definitions of the attributes varied slightly over subjects and
became more specific and detailed towards the end of a decision process,
indicating that new attributes tended to emerge in the course of the process.
In summary, the representation of decision alternatives used in this
paper assumes that a set of aspects on different attributes can map the
decision maker's perceived pattern of attractiveness of the decision alternatives. However, note that nothing is assumed about either the metric
level of the numbers corresponding to the aspects or the degree of commensurability across attributes. These characteristics of the representation are left free for the decision maker to define and for the psychologist
to explore.

DECISION RULES
In order to find the best alternative a decision maker may apply one or
more decision rules on the set of choice alternatives. In the following, a
sample of such decision rules will be listed. The rules will be classified
according to their requirements on the metric level of aspect attractiveness, lexicographic order of attributes, and commensurability across attributes (cf. Montgomery & Svenson, 1976).
During a decision process the representation system and the sequence

<-----Page 3----->PROCESS D E S C R I P T I O N S OF D E C I S I O N S

89

of rules applied may be continuously influencing each other. For instance,
it may be assumed that a decision maker may change the degree of complexity of the representation system to meet the requirements of a decision rule he wants to apply. Correspondingly, the choice of a decision
rule or sequence of rules may be a function of the representation of the
decision problem, because some of the simpler rules are only applicable in a
limited number of cases. For instance, the rule of dominance, which states
that the chosen alternative should be better than the other alternatives on at
least one attribute and better or equal on all others, works only in a limited
number of decision situations. If the representation of the situation makes it
impossible to use the rule of dominance, then another decision rule must be
applied to find the best alternative. Thus, the representation system and the
sampling of decision rules may affect each other in the process of making a
decision.
The rules presented below will most often be described with reference
to a decision between two alternatives, but the generalization to more
alternatives is straightforward. Research demonstrating the use of each of
these rules by decision makers will not be cited here, but empirical examples will be given later in the paper.

Ordinal Attractiveness and No Commensurability (Type I)
The dominance rule states that alternative A, should be chosen over A2
if A1 is better thanA2 on at least one attribute and not worse thanA2 on all
other attributes (cf. Lee, 1971).
The conjunctive decision rule requires the decision maker to specify a
set of criterion values on the attributes which a chosen alternative must be
equal to or exceed. If an alternative does not meet the criterion (cO on just
one attribute, the alternative is dropped from the list of remaining possible
alternatives. This elimination of the alternatives proceeds, if possible,
until only one alternative remains. This rule can be derived from the
satisficing principle (Simon, 1955) and has been regarded as especially
valuable in ill-defined decision making situations (cf. Kozielecki, 1971).
The disjunctive decision rule is the mirror image of the conjunctive rule,
and it also requires a set of criterion values on the attributes. A chosen
alternative must have at least one aspect greater than the corresponding
criterion (dO, and all the aspects of the other alternatives should fall below
or be equal to the criterion values.
The conjunctive and disjunctive rules have been presented and
axiomatized by Coombs and Kao (Note 3), Coombs (1964), and Dawes
(1964a, Note 4).
The above rules do not always lead to a decision. Consider, for example, AI (5, 5, 10) andA~ (10, 5, 5), where the values in parentheses represent attractiveness on three attributes. Obviously, the dominance rule

<-----Page 4----->90

OLA SVENSON

does not work here, because each alternative is better than the other on
one attribute. If the criteria are all equal to or smaller than 5, no alternative can be eliminated according to the conjunctive rule. For the disjunctive rule, if the criteria are all equal to or greater than 10, this rule also
fails.

Ordinal Attractiveness, Lexicographic Order, and No
Commensurability (Type II)
When the attributes are rank ordered in importance they are said to be
in lexicographic order. The following rules utilize such an order in arriving
at a decision.
The lexicographic decision rule prescribes a choice of the alternative
which is most attractive on the most important attribute, fftwo aspects on
this attribute are equally attractive the decision will be based on the most
attractive aspect on the attribute next in order of importance, etc.
Fishburn (1974) has worked on the axiomatization of this rule.
The elimination by aspects rule may be interpreted as a combination of
the lexicographic rule and the conjunctive rule. First, the most important
attribute is investigated, and all alternatives that do not exceed the conjunctive criterion on this attribute are eliminated. This procedure is then
repeated with new attributes successively lower in the lexicographic order. Tversky (1972) introduced this decision rule and presented empirical
evidence supporting it.

Ordinal Attractiveness Differences, Lexicographic Order, and No
Commensurability (Type III)
The minimum difference lexicographic rule works like the lexicographic
rule, with the additional assumption that for each attribute there is a
minimum difference N. Thus, only differences greater than At between
the attractiveness values of two alternatives may determine a decision. If
the difference on the most important attribute is less than 2~, then the
attribute next in the lexicographic order will be considered. As an example of a choice made according to the minimum difference lexicographic
rule, let ~. = 2.5 for all i's and let the choice alternatives be A1 (5, 5, 10)
andA3 (5, 7, 6). If the attributes are given in the lexicographic order, there
is no difference on the first attribute (5-5), and there is too small an
absolute difference on the second attribute (5-7), but on the last attribute
the difference (10-6) is large enough for a choice of A1. The lexicographic
semiorder rule (Tversky, 1969) is a special case of this decision rule where
A i is defined only for the most important attribute. For all other attributes
it equals zero.
Situations where information about the attribute is missing as a result of
imperfect discrimination or of unreliability of available information may
encourage the use of rules depending on minimum differences on the
attribute.

Ordinal Attractiveness and Commensurability (Type IV)
In addition to ordinal attractiveness, the following rules also require
attractiveness values which are comparable (commensurate) across different attributes. Such rules are also called compensatory.
The maximizing number of attributes with greater attractiveness rule
prescribes a choice of the alternative with the greater number of favorable
attributes. More specifically, the rule requires that for each attribute the
aspect of a decision alternative must be classified as better, equal, or
worse than the attractiveness of the other alternative on that attribute.
That alternative will be chosen which has the greater number of favorable
classifications. Thus, the rule does not lead to a decision between two
alternatives when the numbers of positive classifications for both alternatives are equal. Although this rule does not require commensurability when
deciding which alternative is best on each attribute, it implies commensurability in the final stage when the number of positive classifications are
compared.
The elimination by least attractive aspect rule means that the decision
maker eliminates the alternative which has the overall worst aspect.
The choice by most attractive aspect rule simply says that the decision
maker should choose that alternative which has the overall most attractive
aspect.

Ordinal Attractiveness Differences and Commensurability (Type V)
The choice by greatest attractiveness difference rule implies that the
decision maker first looks for the attribute with the greatest attractiveness
difference. After this he chooses the alternative which is more attractive
on this attribute, irrespective of the other attributes. This rule may be
seen as an analog to the minimax regret principle in game theory.

Interval Attractiveness (Utility) and Commensurability (Type VI)
At a higher level of representation, type VI, the concept of attractiveness is replaced by the term utility. Most of the research in the decision
making area relies on this rather sophisticated and cognitively demanding
way of representing the decision alternatives. Only two examples will be
given, rather than a review of all the algebraic decision rules which may
be listed in this group. The most thorough presentation of algebraic models of this type for information integration have been given by Anderson
(1974a, 1974b). Techniques for weighted multiattribute utility assessments
have been presented by, e.g., von Winterfeldt and Fischer (1975). Recently, Shanteau (1977) presented a review of algebraic models of risky
decision making.
The addition of utilities rule states that a decision is based on a
summation of all utilities for each alternative. The alternative with the
greater sum of utility will then be chosen.
The addition of utility differences rule states that a decision is based on

<-----Page 6----->92

OLA SVENSON

differences between the utilities of different alternatives on the same attribute. However, the differences (aik - a2k) between alternatives A i and
A2 on attribute k do not contribute linearly to the overall evaluation.
Instead, they enter as arguments in a function which determines the contribution of each utility difference to the overall evaluation process. This
rule was proposed by Tversky (1969), who found subjects using it for
making decisions. Later, Montgomery (1977) replicated this finding. The
addition of utilities rule is algebraically a special case of this rule.

Ratio Attractiveness and Commensurability (Type VII)
The subjective expected utility model implies that the utility of each
aspect should be weighted by the subjective probability of its occurrence
when summing the utilities for an alternative. The alternative with the
greater total expected utility will then be chosen as in the preceding rule.
Earlier, the attribute of subjective probability or belief was not given any
special numerical status, but the present rule requires a ratio representation of at least this attribute.

Decision Rules and Heuristics
Montgomery and Svenson (1976) suggested principles which may guide
the choice of a decision rule or rules for a given decision problem. However, the presentation and discussion of these principles will follow later.
In addition to Montgomery and Svenson, other authors have recently
given more or less comprehensive presentations of decision rules or models for decision making (e.g., Bettman & Jones, 1972; Wright, 1975; van
Raaij, 1976; Libby & Fishburn, 1977; Beach & Mitchell, Note 1). As
mentioned earlier, decision rules of types I - I I I are often called noncompensatory, and rules of types I V - V I I compensatory (e.g., Einhorn,
1970).
When a decision maker is faced with complex multiattribute alternatives in a new or important situation, the more complex of the above
decision rules may be particularly relevant. However, if similar decision
problems have often been faced earlier it is possible that a decision maker
has developed simplifying strategies or heuristics to help him arrive at a
decision more easily (cf. Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). A subject who
starts to apply rules of a less complex type after making a number of
successively more complex decisions illustrates the introduction of a
heuristic strategy which may or may not involve the use of some of the
above decision rules. Still, the decision maker may return to a more
detailed and complete decision making procedure if he encounters a decision which is very important to him.
Thus, simplifying strategies may be developed from the decision
maker's own experience with similar decision problems. Heuristic decision rules may also be derived from other people's experience. Examples
of heuristics of the latter category are (a) a decision rule saying that one

<-----Page 7----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS

OF DECISIONS

93

should follow the decision of an expert, and (b) the simplifying strategy of
deciding according to cultural or family tradition. Sometimes when
heuristics are applicable a decision problem may be more fruitfully
viewed as a problem of categorization (cf. Hogarth, 1974). That is, the decision problem is solved on the basis of its similarity to one of a number of
classes of decision situations, to which each class has its own standard
solution.
Toda (1976) has pointed out that many parts of the decision process
become automatic heuristics, implying that many potential choices become impossible. In addition, heuristics which were once conscious may
become unconscious. This can be disadvantageous, because heuristics
which were once good may lose their relevance or even become detrimental in a rapidly changing world.
Studies of rather slow decision processes, which are repeated so many
times that the decison maker starts using simplifying strategies, may provide much information about the role of heuristics in decision making.
Russo and Dosher (Note 9) asked subjects to make a great number of
repeated choices between two multiattribute alternatives. Two types of
heuristics appeared in this situation. One of these, the "majority of confirming dimensions," corresponded exactly to the type IV rule of choosing that alternative which maximizes the number of aspects with the greater attractiveness over the attributes. The other heuristic, "dimensional
reduction," implied the elimination of one attribute when making the
decision. In general the attribute with the smaller difference between the
aspects of the alternatives was ignored.
It would be interesting to know if some people prefer one set of decision
rules and other people another set of decision rules for making a decision.
Some authors have successfully relied on such interindividual differences in choices of decision rules in their experiments (e.g., Tversky,
1969; Montgomery, 1977). Others have grouped their subjects in different
groups according to their information processing patterns (e.g., Bettman
& Jacoby, 1976; Payne & Braunstein, Note 7). Although the results seem
to indicate the existence of individual search patterns in some of the
decision situations investigated, little is known about the consistency of
rules across situations. However thought-provoking the idea, it is much
too early to allege the existence of individual decision habits at present.
Still, in the future the exploration of individual decision strategies may
well be of common interest for clinical psychologists and psychologists
interested in personality and decision processes.
TECHNIQUES FOR STUDYING DECISION MAKING AS A PROCESS
There are two main approaches to studying the cognitive processes
leading up to a decision. One is to perform what may be called a structural
analysis of the final judgments or decisions. Such an analysis typically

<-----Page 8----->94

OLA SVENSON

focuses on the end result of a decision process and tries to relate the final
decision to parameters characterizing the decision problem. By active
manipulation of these parameters mathematical or statistical models are
used to draw inferences about the decision process.
The other approach to studying decision processes employs process
tracing techniques. Here, the fundamental belief is that cognitive processes should be studied by collecting data during the decision process as
often as possible. Data typically analyzed in this tradition are records of
eye movements and think-aloud protocols. The results of such an analysis
can, e.g., be described in a flow diagram or simulated on a computer.
Even though the former of these two approaches has been almost exclusively used in the past, I believe that the latter is much needed at the
present stage of our knowledge about individual decision making. Therefore the remainder of the paper will be almost exclusively devoted to
process tracing studies of decision making. However, first some additional comments on structural analysis of final decisions will be given for
the sake of completeness.

Structural Analyses of Final Judgments
Algebraic models typically provide good descriptions of the relations
between cues and responses in decision making experiments (cf. Slovic et
al., 1977). This holds true for models within the framework of Anderson's
(1974a, 1974b) "information integration theory" and those within Hammond's "social judgment theory" (cf. Hammond, Stewart, Brehmer, &
Steinman, 1975). However, in the case of another algebraic model, the
SEU model, there have been small but persistent misfits between model
and data for a long time, and a number of recent, rigorous tests of the
model have shown that it seems at most to be able to provide only a global
fit to choice data (cf. Slovic et al., 1977). Independently of the degree of fit
between algebraic models and data, these models only provide surface
descriptions, as they do not map the details of the successive stages in the
decision process. However, the development of algebraic models may be
seen as a first step toward understanding cognitive processes and they
may again be needed when process tracing studies have generated a new
generation of research problems.
In addition to analyses of final judgments or decisions the use of the
latency for producing the response may be analyzed as a dependent variable. Reaction time has been systematically used in perceptual experiments (cf. Neisser, 1967), and latencies became common in cognitive
studies during the late 1960s. Sternberg (1969) presented the basic
philosophy and assumptions for stagewise analyses of cognitive processes
using latencies (cf. also Taylor, 1976).
At its simplest, a cognitive process may consist of a series of indepen-

<-----Page 9----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS

OF DECISIONS

95

dent subprocesses, each requiring a constant processing time. By changing characteristics of the problems to be solved it is possible to arrive at a
process description of the sequence of cognitive subprocesses which
leads to the solution by observing the total reaction time. Since the
analysis gains its power from repeated decisions this method may be
applied most fruitfully in quick, consistent decision processes. Decision
making may then be described as a process where successive applications
of decision rules constitute the cognitive subprocesses.
Decision time, when recorded in experiments on decision making, has
often been regarded as a function of some global characteristic of the
situation such as "difficulty" (Pollay, 1970; Hogarth, 1975) or has been
used as a complement to other types of information about the decision
process such as information search patterns (e.g., Payne & Braunstein,
Note 7; Bettman & Kakkar, 1977). If time measures are taken at different
stages during a decision process, and not after its completion only, such
methods of collecting latencies may be seen as belonging to the process
tracing techniques. However, to the best of my knowledge no such experiments have yet been performed to study decision making processes.

Process Tracing Techniques
Two process tracing measures will be discussed briefly here, viz., information search measures and verbal protocols. However, this section
will not contain any detailed presentations of different process tracing
techniques, as this has been done in a recent paper which is focused on
applications of process tracing techniques in studies of decision making
(Payne, Braunstein, & Carroll, Note 8).
Information Search Patterns
The order in which a decision maker seeks and evaluates the information
of a decision problem is related to the cognitive process leading to the
final decision. There are several ways of tracing information search patterns. Eye movement recordings and records of the information explicitly
demanded by a decision maker are the main types. Eye movement recordings can be made accurately if the number of pieces of information (alternatives Ã attributes) is low. Recently, Just and Carpenter (1976) discussed eye fixations and cognitive processes in a comprehensive article. If
the number of aspects is large the recordings from eye movement cameras
become too imprecise. In that case it is better to let the decision maker
ask for the information he finds necessary for a choice. Examples of
analyses of information search patterns have been given by Payne et al.
(Note 8), Russo and Rosen (1975), who analyzed eye fixations in multialternative choices, and Payne (1976), who used records of explicit information search to study choices among apartments. More specifically, Payne
used an information board with a number of cards arranged in an alterna-

<-----Page 10----->96

OLA SVENSON

tive Ã attribute matrix for presenting the decision alternatives. In order to
get information about the alternatives the decision maker had to take a
card, turn it over, and read its information. This simple arrangement made
it easy to register the information search pattern.
There are some important assumptions on which analyses of information search patterns rest. When the subject looks at an aspect, this information is assumed to be processed at a cognitive level also. In addition, a
decision maker's attention to a certain aspect is seen as reflecting the
search for a piece of information which is necessary for a decision
according to a predetermined rule or strategy. Furthermore, a longer
period of attention to an aspect is assumed to be paralleled by a more
complex cognitive process than is a shorter fixation.

Verbal Reports
The idea of using verbal protocols is an old one. Verbal protocols were
used at the beginning of this century when subjects were asked to introspect. Later, Duncker (1945) used verbal protocols to study problem solving. Clarkson (1962) used them in a study of portfolio selection in trust
investment, De Groot (1946, 1965) for studies in the thinking of chess
players, and Bettman (Note 2) in an investigation of consumer choice
behavior. Ericsson (Note 5) presented different types of verbal protocols in
an extensive study of thought processes during problem solving. However, the Anglo-American behavioristic tradition did not encourage the
use of verbal protocols, and the method was for many years confined
mainly to the pyschological tradition of continental Europe. However,
with the birth of the computer new ways for thinking about and processing
complex data emerged, making it possible to couple verbal protocols with
computer programs. The pioneers in this tradition were Newell and Simon
(1972).
Verbal protocols may be retrospective or simultaneous in relation to the
cognitive process they cover. Retrospective verbal reports are given after
the solution of a problem or the choice in a decision task; they are an
interpretation of the subjects' thought processes during the problem solving or decision process. Another way of collecting verbal protocol data is
to ask the subject in an experiment to think aloud. More specifically, the
subject is instructed to say aloud any thought that occurs during the solution of the experimental task. Typically, simultaneous verbal protocols or
think-aloud data are collected when the solution of each decision or
choice problem requires a long period of time. This makes it possible for
the subject to talk in parallel with the decision making process.
Russo and Rosen (1975) introduced the technique of prompted verbal
protocols. A prompted protocol is a retrospective protocol that is prompted by the subject's sequence of eye fixations. That is, he is asked to

<-----Page 11----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS OF DECISIONS

97

report about his thoughts during the choice that he has just completed
with the aid of a replay of his eye fixation sequence. The eye fixations are
superimposed on the original display of decision alternatives, and the
speed of this replay is controlled by the subject.
Retrospective verbal reports may at best be regarded as unobtrusive
measures. However, simultaneous verbal reports are not unobtrusive, as
the production of simultaneous speech requires mental effort which may
affect a decision making or problem solving process.
Payne and Braunstein (Note 7) pointed out that one of the differences
between modern uses of think-aloud data and the way think-aloud data
were used in introspection is the transfer of theorizing from the subject to
the experimenter. In classical introspection the subject was often well
trained and had good theoretical knowledge of the psychological phenomenon under study. In contrast, modern use of verbal protocols involves
naive subjects and encourages spontaneous thoughts with no demand that
they should fit into a consistent or complete frame of reference or model.
The effort to fit data to a model or a theory is the responsibility of the
investigator and not of the subjects. Today's emphasis on spontaneous
simultaneous verbal reports makes the interpretation of data more public
and guarantees more objectivity than would be possible if the subject were
to give interpretations.
Recently, Nisbett and Wilson (1977) published an important paper on
verbal reports of mental processes. The authors reviewed a great number
of investigations, the majority of which were dissonance and attribution
studies. But a number of the studies also belonged to other areas, such as
perception and problem solving. The conclusion drawn from this review
about the value of verbal reports as indicators of cognitive processes is
quite pessimistic. By reviewing investigations which used mostly retrospective verbal reports, Nisbett and Wilson showed that many cognitive
processes are unconscious and not directly retrievable from memory, but
that their existence may be derived from knowledge about other types of
responses and about stimuli in the experimental situation. Nisbett and
Wilson concluded that "though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report
accurately about t h e m . . , when influential stimuli are salient and plausible causes of the responses they produce" (p. 231). It seems as if Nisbett
and Wilson believe that the major and important part of the set of existing
cognitive processes can only be inferred from structural analyses and that
they are impossible to elucidate through analyses of verbal protocols.
This belief is not shared by the present author. Of course, as Nisbett and
Wilson have illustrated, it is important to be extremely careful when
analyzing verbal protocols. Special care must be taken when interpreting
retrospective verbal protocols, because they allow enough time and the

<-----Page 12----->98

OLA SVENSON

overview of a complete process necessary for a subject to apply his own
psychological theory of what is going on. For instance, in the experiment
reported by Svenson (Note 10) it was found that the final justification of a
choice often gave rather misleading and simplified information about the
preceding decision process.
All interpretations of think-aloud protocols rest on the assumption that
the decision maker gives a correct description of at least some parts of his
train of thought during the decision process. It is important to note that,
just like any other dependent measure, a verbal protocol cannot be coded
without a model or a theory for the decision process. The model and the
data upon which it rests may also be tested by collecting other types of
empirical data, such as latencies or final judgments. The reliabifity of the
coding of verbal protocols has not, as a rule, been reported in the literature, but it can be easily determined by having different persons code the
same protocol. Svenson (Note 10) and Thorngate and Maki (Note 11)
reported very high interjudge agreement for trained coders using this
technique.
When two subjects make a joint decision the discussion between them
constitutes a natural verbal protocol, which may be tape recorded and
used for inferences about decision rules and information processing (cf.
Payne, Note 6) in much the same way as think-aloud protocols.

PROCESS TRACING STUDIES
The aim of a process tracing study is to reveal a train of thought, called
a cognitive process, leading to a final decision or solution. When mapping
this process it is necessary to know what content or information is processed and how it is processed. One way of proceeding is to start mapping
the decision maker's objective pattern of information input and then draw
inferences about what parts of the objective information are represented
subjectively. The sequence in which the information is searched may also be
used for inferences about how decision rules or strategies could have been
used in arriving at a choice. Unfortunately, many of these patterns can be
predicted from several rules. In addition, inferences from search patterns
to rules are sometimes based on the rather unrealistic assumption that a
decision maker uses one and only one rule all the way through a decision
process. Montgomery and Svenson (1976) suggested that, on the contrary,
different decision rules may be applied in succession in the same choice
situation. However, a particular information search pattern may indicate
that some complex rules have not been applied in a decision process. For
instance, incomplete information search eliminates rules of types I V - V I I ,
and a random walk through the aspects eliminates the lexicographic type II
rule.
In the following, the phrase "information search patterns" refers only

<-----Page 13----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS

to the order in which a decision maker searches the aspects and to which
aspects he investigates in a choice situation. Thus, the interesting question of what subjective values or attractiveness these aspects represent
will be postponed until a later section.

Intraalternative and Intraattribute Information Search
The most common way of categorizing an information search pattern is
to investigate whether it focuses on alternatives or on attributes.
If the decision maker uses alternatives as reference points for the
search, he will investigate all the attributes for one alternative before
going to the next alternative; this is an instance of intraalternative search.
In contrast, a decision maker who anchors his information search on
attributes investigates the aspects of one attribute for all the alternatives
before going to the next attribute; this is an example of intraattribute
search.
The above examples assume it is possible to find information for all
alternatives on all attributes. In addition, the search protocols are complete in that all aspects are investigated before a decision is made. In
principle, any decision rule may be applied when the information search is
complete, but the more complex rules (types I V - V I I ) may be associated
more strongly with complete information search protocols. In many cases
the choice alternatives cannot be characterized on a common set of attributes. In this case a complete search is impossible, and only rules of type
I and the rule of addition of utilities can produce subjectively satisfactory
decisions based on the available information. Slovic and MacPhillamy
(1974) showed that when information was not given about all relevant
attributes for all alternatives, subjects emphasized aspects on the common
attribute in a judgment task. It would be most interesting to investigate
further the effects of deliberately limiting the information in a decision task
in this way. To illustrate, when one subject could not find the information for
which she searched (Svenson, Note 10), she started inferential reasoning
with herself to derive a reasonable value on the missing attribute.
Information search protocols seldom exhibit simple, striking intraalternative or intraattribute patterns, whether they be based on eye fixations,
explicit information requests, or think-aloud protocols. Therefore, the
protocols are often analyzed in shorter segments, with a sequence of
information search defined by two (e.g., Payne, 1976), three, or four
consecutive aspects (e.g., Russo & Rosen, 1976). An instance of intraalternative search is then a sequence where one or more consecutive aspects characterize the same alternative. Correspondingly, an intraattribute search denotes a sequence in which the aspects on one attribute are
searched in succession. The overall proportions of the different types of
search patterns may then be used to characterize a protocol.

<-----Page 14----->100

OLA SVENSON

Russo and Dosher (Note 9) used retrospective verbal reports for validating interpretations based only on eye fixation patterns. The interpretations involved cases when three or more subsequent fixations were classifted as reflecting an intraattribute or an intraalternative processing. The
proportion of the interpretations, which were confirmed by the subjects in
the prompted verbal protocols, were about 0.87 for intraattribute processing and about 0.78 for intraalternative processing.
Bettman and Jacoby (1976) have argued against the simple split in intraalternative and intraattribute search. They found many subjects whose
information search strategies they called "choice by feedback processing." These search patterns were characterized by alternating short
sequences of intraalternative and intraattribute search.
A decision maker's failure to search all available information is an
indication of the use of the simpler rules of types I - I I I (except for the
dominance rule, which requires complete information). The more complex rules with rank or interval attractiveness and commensurability cannot be used to explain the incomplete search patterns which are so common (cf. Kleinmuntz, 1963; Svenson, Note 10; Payne, 1976). However,
this does not imply that more complex rules may not be applied in subprocesses nested within a longer decision making process.
Information Search as a Function of Number of Alternatives
and Attributes

Process tracing studies have been applied almost exclusively to decision problems in which the information about each alternative has been
characterized by the same set of attributes. Thus, the total number of
aspects in a decision problem has been m (number of alternatives) Ã n
(number of attributes).
The proportion of aspects searched in a decision process may be assumed to decrease as the number (m Ã n) increases. Empirical evidence
for this assumption is given in Fig. 1, which shows the percentage of
available information searched as a function of number of alternatives and
attributes. The data were taken from recent investigations by Payne
(1976), Payne and Braunstein (Note 7), van Raaij (1976), and Thorngate
and Maki (Note 11) for a variety of decision tasks. The points in the figure
are based on different numbers of subjects and different decision tasks,
and therefore too much generalizing should be avoided. However, the
decreasing trend of the proportion of aspects searched with increasing
number of alternatives and attributes is clear. Furthermore, data seem to
indicate that increasing the number of attributes has a greater effect on the
proportion of information searched than an increase in the number of
alternatives. More specifically, given a constant number of aspects ( m x
n), an increase in the number of alternatives m (and a corresponding

decrease in the number of attributes n) generally leads to a higher utilization of the information provided.
The proportions of intraalternative and intraattribute transitions could
also be plotted in the same way as the percentage of the aspects searched
was plotted in Fig. 1. Payne (1976) suggested an index which indicates the
extent to which a search pattern contains intraalternative and intraattribute transitions. If an aspect is on the same alternative as the immediately preceding one, there occurs an intraalternative transition. If an
aspect belongs to the same attribute as the preceding one, this is an
instance of an intraattribute transition. Let the total number of intraalternative transitions be N(alt) and the number of intraatribute transitions be
N(attr). Payne's index is then the ratio [N(alt) - N(attr)]/[N(alt) +

<-----Page 16----->102

OLA SVENSON

N(attr)]. This index is equal to 1.00 if N(attr) - 0, and equals -1.00 if
N(attr) = 0. If there are equal numbers of both types of transitions the
index equals 0.0. Note that this index is independent of the number of
transitions occurring with a change of both alternative and attribute. I
have applied this index to data presented by Payne (1976, exp. 1), Payne
and Braunstein (Note 7), van Raaij (1976, exp. 6), and Thorngate and Maki
(Note 11). Recently Bettman and Jacoby (1976) suggested a correction of
this index which has not been applied here.
The data in the Thorngate and Maki study were collected from 90
subjects in voting decisions involving political candidates. The set of candidates consisted of 2, 4, or 8 persons characterized by their opinion in 2,
4, or 8 political issues. Each choice was characterized as predominantly
intraalternative (strategies OI, TOI, and S in the investigators' code) or
intraattribute (strategies IC and TIS). Thus, the authors presented results
which do not correspond exactly to the data that the other authors derived
on an aspect-to-aspect basis. Still, for illustrative purposes I have undertaken the same procedure to get the index with the trials classified by
Thorngate and Maki (Note 11), as was taken with the Payne (1976), Payne
and Braunstein (Note 7) and van Raaij (1976) data. The results indicated
that there was a strong overall tendency to process aspects in an intraattribute way. This was illustrated by the fact that the majority of the index
values were smaller than zero. In addition, there was a tendency towards
increasing intraalternative search when the number of alternatives increased. This tendency was nonexistent for two-attribute alternatives but
became clearer with an increasing number of attributes. Data presented
by other authors support these results (cf. Russo & Dosher, 1976; van
Raaij, 1976).
Search Pattern and Information Presentation
The presentation format strongly affects information search patterns.
Bettman and Kakkar (1977) presented subjects with information about 11
alternatives, each characterized by 13 attributes (a) in matrix form with
aspect in an attributes x alternatives design, (b) in an alternative centered
condition where each alternative was described in a booklet, and (c) in an
attribute centered condition in which information about each aspect was
given in a booklet. The results showed that when the information was given
in an alternative or an attribute centered way, subjects adapted to the way
of presentation by processing the information in an intraalternative and an
intraattribute way, respectively.
Another way of affecting the information search was demonstrated by
Russo and Rosen (1975), who manipulated the similarity of six threeattribute alternatives. The results showed that the greater the number of
similar pairs there were in a decision situation, the greater the probability

<-----Page 17----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS

OF DECISIONS

103

was that a decision maker started processing the similar alternatives. This
trend was statistically significant from the increase which can be predicted from a simple random processing of the aspects when the number
of similar pairs increases.
The comparability of attributes plays an important role in determining
information processing patterns. For instance, in a decision between duplex gambles (where each of the four attributes is represented by either a
dollar or a probability measure) comparisons in the same unit (e.g., dollars and dollars) are easier than comparisons of different units (e.g., dollars
and probabilities) (cf. Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1968).
Search Pattern Changes during a Decision Process
As a result of the application of different rules during different stages of
a decision process, the information search pattern may change over time.
To study such changes, protocols are sometimes partitioned into a number
of equal parts which are analyzed separately.
When van Raaij (1976, exp. 3) computed the proportions of different
processing patterns over quartiles of his protocols he found that the proportion of intraalternative processing increased with time. However, the
proportion of intraattribute comparisons was stable and did not decrease
over time. When van Raaij partitioned another group of protocols into two
halves (van Raaij, 1976, exps. 6 & 7) the results were the same.
Tuggle, Barron, and Day (Note 12) noted that their subject first fixated
on those alternatives which had distinguishing aspects, such as very large
or small payoffs. This observation seems to be congruent with the general
finding that information processing behavior is contingent on the aspects
of the situation and may indicate the initial use of a conjunctive or a
disjunctive (type I) rule. The first aspect attended to may determine which
rules the decision maker will use in the subsequent decision process.
When Payne (1976) and Thorngate and Maki (Note 11) studied changes
in information patterns over trials or decisions, they reported no differences. However, the numbers of trials in their experiments were quite
small due to the rather time-consuming decision processes being studied,
and their subjects probably did not have time to change their decision
strategies during four or five trials.
Decision Rules and Metric Representation of Alternatives:
Some Examples
Up until now I have only discussed the order in which aspects are
searched. Now, the difficult issue of how the aspects are cognitively
represented by the decision maker and how he uses them cannot be postponed any further. More specifically, what metric characteristics of the
aspects are used by the decision maker when applying the rules for making a choice?

<-----Page 18----->104

OLA SVENSON

In the following, some excerpts from verbal protocol data will be presented and discussed with regard to possible subjective representation
and the decision rules applied. The first example is from Kleinmuntz
(1963, p. 318), who had experts decide if MMPI profiles characterized an
emotionally "maladjusted" or "adjusted" college student.
I ' m throwing all Mults with at least 4 scales p r i m e d . . . I'll throw all Mults to the right
(most adjusted) if there' s no clinical scale above a T score o f 6 0 . . . I'll let Ma go up as
high as 8 0 . . . may be a raw score of 10 on Mt would be playing it s a f e . . , so I ' m
looking at three things now and sorting according to these conditions.

This decision maker seems to verbalize three conjunctive decision
criteria which he applies to each candidate in turn. Even though the
information is given in numerals he need only represent the alternatives
on ordinal attractiveness scales without commensurability over attributes
(type I).
The next example comes from Bettman (Note 2, p. 9), who obtained
think-aloud protocols from shopping housewives.
cucumbers are still too expensive / Bacon costs too much to get at all / I get the,
the little tenderized ones [steaks], what are they called? These are the ones if they
get below a d o l l a r / . . . I picked it because it was the biggest one [pork shoulder].

As one may expect, the attribute of price is very important and is first in
a lexicographic order of attributes. The elimination by aspects (type II)
rule may have been applied here, since the protocol indicates the existence of criterion values on this attribute (contingent on the type of food
under consideration). When the decision maker moves from the price
attribute to the next attribute in the lexicographic order, the attribute of
size determines the choice. Thus, the alternatives in this example must at
least be represented on ordinal scales of attractiveness which are lexicographically ordered.
The following excerpt is from Payne (1976, p. 375); the decision maker
is making a choice of which student apartment he wants to rent.
Since we have a whole bunch here / I ' m going to go across the top and / see which
noise levels are high / If there are any high ones / I'll reject them i m m e d i a t e l y / . . .
Go to D / It has a high noise level / So, we'll automatically eliminate D.

The intraattribute search is consistent with an elimination by aspect
(type II) or perhaps a conjunctive (type I) rule. However, the choice of the
examined attribute may have been performed according to a lexicographic
order of importance; in that case the excerpt is more consistent with a
lexicographic order with no commensurability (type II) representation of
the alternatives.
Montgomery (1977) studied choices between two duplex gambles. One
of his subjects gave the following protocol.
I'll take the one with the larger Sum o f money because they [the probabilities of
winning] look almost the same.

<-----Page 19----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS OF DECISIONS

105

This protocol may indicate the use of a type III rule with ordinal attractiveness differences and no commensurability across the attributes. In
isolation, this short excerpt gives no information about the existence of an
order of importance between the attributes of sum to be won and the
probability of winning which Montgomery found in the complete protocol. This order of importance is necessary for the minimum difference
lexicographic (type III) rule which the citation illustrates.
When making a choice between two duplex gambles (Payne & Braunstein, Note 7) a subject gave the following protocol. PL stands for the
probability of losing, $L for the sum to be lost, and PW for the probability of
winning $W, The decision is thus between alternatives A and B, each
characterized by four attributes.
P L i s . . . is lower on A / The $L is higher on A than on B / such a choice / Since B
has a much higher PW / I'll take that.

It seems as if this subject, in addition to the initially used rank order on
each attribute, uses a rank order of attractiveness differences rule (type
V) with commensurability across attributes.
Payne (1976, p. 378) gives examples of more complex representations
and rules in choices among student apartments.
O.K., we have an A and a B / First look at the rent for both of them. / The rent for A
is $170 and / The rent for B is $140. / $170 is a little steep, / but it might have a low
noise level. / So we'll check A ' s noise level. / A ' s noise level is low. / We'll go to
B's noise level. / It's h i g h / G e e , I can't really very well study with a lot of noise. /
So I'll ask myself the question, is it worth spending that extra $30 a month for / to
be able to study in my apartment.

Here the subject has a lexicographic order and at least an interval scale
of attribute attractiveness. There is also commensurability between the
attributes of price and noise, as the trade-off procedure in the protocol
indicates, so the rule applied must be of type VI. It is interesting to note
that the justification for the decision (to choose A) is given in a very
simple form ("Gee, I can't study with a lot of noise/ . . . / t o be able to
study in my apartment"). This is in accordance with the finding by Svenson (Note 10) that the choice of a home was most often justified by
mentioning a subsample of attributes on which the choice was dominant
even though much more complex decision rules had been used earlier in
the choice process.
The following excerpt from Bettman (Note 2, p. 12) illustrates the use of
a simplified rule or heuristic.
I ' d still rather [get] this, because I've used it before [ f l o u r ] . . . / I f I had them once,
and I liked it the last thing that I used I'll pick that again next time.

This is an example of a very easy and straightforward heuristic which
says that you should repeat an earlier successful decision. Heuristics are

<-----Page 20----->106

OLA SVENSON

certainly the most important aids for making decisions in everyday life.
However, as a result of the emphasis on longer and more difficult decisions in present day literature, it is a little difficult to find published
examples of other heuristics besides those discussed by Tversky and
Kahneman (1974).
As the above examples illustrate, it is possible to identify only the
simplest type of rule which could have been used in arriving at a decision
from a verbal protocol. Logically, this implies that any rules more complex than the one coupled with a protocol might also have been used, as
long as the same result may have been predicted from it. Fortunately, data
from the information search pattern give more information about complicated rules which could not have been applied in a given decision process.
For instance, an incomplete search protocol eliminates the more complex
types of decision rules requiring complete information. In some cases this
makes it possible to draw strong inferences about the decision process.
However, many of the inferences about decision rules still lack precision
and need validation in further research.

Absolute Evaluation vs Comparison o f Aspects
Evaluative statements about the aspects of the alternatives may be
comparative, that is, given in relation to another aspect in the situation
(e.g., "this apartment A is bigger than B") or absolute, which implies that
some implicit criterion has been used (e.g., this apartment is rather big).
The proportion of comparative statements divided by the sum of comparative and absolute statements decreases with increasing number of
choice alternatives, e.g., compare the studies by Montgomery (1977),
Svenson (Note 10), and Payne and Braunstein (Note 7). This is congruent
with the evidence, presented earlier, that intraalternative search tends to
increase with increasing number of choice alternatives. Svenson (Note 10)
also reported that the proportion of comparative statements increased in
the last part of the decision process.
When absolute evaluations have been given they have been coded by
the researches in three categories, poor, fair, and good (cf. Payne &
Braunstein, Note 7) or four (Russo & Dosher, Note 9). Svenson (Note 10)
made an attempt to classify evaluation statements in five categories but did
not achieve satisfactory agreement between his two coders on the use of
the categories. Montgomery (1977) coded differences on an attribute in
three categories, about equal, little difference, and large difference.
The Order of Rules in a Decision Process
Data from process tracing studies often seem to indicate that a number
of decision rules are applied in succession in the same choice situation. A
decision maker may use different rules in arriving at a decision but he may

<-----Page 21----->PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS

OF DECISIONS

107

also use the same rules repeatedly while changing criterion levels during
the information search. The conjunctive, the disjunctive, and the
minimum difference lexicographic rules all need criteria for application,
and these criteria may be contingent upon the decision situation. The
change of rules or of criteria may occur for various reasons. A decision
rule which is not applicable on a decision problem when first tried may
lead to a change in the rule or in the representation system which may, for
instance, become more differentiated. A new rule may also be applied to
confirm a tentative decision and make it final and public (cf. Russo &
Dosher, Note 9). On a more global level (e.g., Vlek, Note 13; Toda, 1976)
the decision maker's goal-setting (Atkinson & Feather, 1966; Lopes,
1976; Toda, 1976) plays an important role for the choice of decision rules.
However, this important issue has not been treated in such a way that it
may be related to the specific decision rules presented in this paper.
Perhaps existing theories of personality will be able to connect the decision maker's goal setting with his choice of decision rules for solving a
decision problem.
As Montgomery and Svenson (1976) and others have pointed out, different decision rules may require different amounts of cognitive effort, so
that the different types of rules may be ordered on an effort continuum.
Decision makers who want to minimize the amount of cognitive effort
spent in a situation may tend to apply simpler rules before they try more
complex rules. However, the simpler rules do not always lead to a decision. Therefore, the decision maker may find himself in a conflict. Should
he try a more complex decision rule with a great probability of reaching
the solution of the decision problem? Or should he choose a simpler one
with the risk of not being able to make the decision in accordance with the
rule? In addition to this, it is reasonable to assume that the importance of
a decision problem affects the decision maker's tendency to use more
complex and complete rules. The difficulty of making complex decisions
may reinforce the use of heuristics such as "make a choice as an expert
prescribes," "decide as you did in a similar situation," or "decide according to the cultural or moral norms you believe in." Then a decision
problem has been transformed into a problem of classification or of similarity. However, the minimization of cognitive effort principle may not be
universally valid. When a decision maker feels no information overload he
may instead seek stimulation by evaluating decision alternatives in greater
detail using more complex rules.
Wright (1975) simply instructed his subjects to use different decision
rules to get information about the degree of cognitive effort they required.
He asked the subjects to use one of four different decision rules in choices
among transistors, each characterized by four 5-level attributes. Two of

<-----Page 22----->108

OLA SVENSON

the rules were averaging models of type VI, one was the conjunctive rule
(type I), and another the lexicographic rule (type II). A dependent measure
was average correct choices according to the rule and the objective values
on the attributes characterizing the alternatives. In addition, data on how
easy and appropriate the decision rules seemed to the subjects were also
collected. However, the results showed no significant differences between
type IV rules and the simpler rules when subjects evaluated how easy the
rules were to apply. The lexicographic rule was superior in that it gave a
higher number of correct decisions than the other rules. The idea of instructing subjects to make choices according to different rules is an interesting one because such experiments may generate information about
such things as the amount of cognitive effort required by different rules and
their perceived applicability. However, there is a need for investigations
with greater numbers of aspects and values on the attributes, where verbal
protocols and latencies are also collected.
Slovic (1975) performed an experiment which illustrates the use of two
rules in succession. He started his experiment by having a subject identify
pairs of decision alternatives which were equal in value. Then he presented only these pairs to the subject and forced him to make a decision
between the alternatives. The results showed that in the first part of the
experiment the subjects used rather elaborate decision rules, implying at
least a rank order of attractiveness differences and commensurability
across alternatives (type V). In the second part of the experiment the decisions were made according to a much simpler type II rule, implying that
the alternative superior on the most important attribute was chosen.
Thus, only ordinal attractiveness and lexicographic order with no commensurability were sufficient for a decision in the second part of the
experiment.
There is a great lack of thorough analyses of process tracing protocols
in sequences of decision rules applied in succession. It is true that sometimes it may be hard to collect information about the order in which
decision rules are applied, but much remains to be done, even on already
existing data.
Recently, Wright and Barbour (Note 14) postulated that a decision
process initially consists of a screening phase, where a conjunctive rule
may be used, followed by a second decision phase, where the choice of
decision rules may be varied. In accordance with this assumption they
first instructed their subjects to make choices among a number of resistors
characterized by six attributes. The subjects were given criteria for a first
decision stage so that the outcome of the screening process could be
controlled experimentally. The second and final decision was made
necessary by the experimenters, who sometimes told the subjects that the
chosen alternative was no longer in the market, and that they therefore

<-----Page 23----->P R O C E S S D E S C R I P T I O N S OF D E C I S I O N S

109

had to make another decision. In other cases the initial decision phase was
designed so that it did not leave any alternative which passed all the given
criteria. Then the subjects were forced to make a second decision because
of the structure of the decision task and the criteria chosen. The results
showed that in the second stage many subjects used a lexicographic decision rule and an algebraic rule to arrive at a final decision. The results also
showed early eliminations of alternatives produced by the intraattribute
screening procedure of the initial phase. For instance, subjects tended to
restrict their choices among the most recently rejected alternatives; an
alternative which was examined and eliminated early in the first screening
had less chance to be considered in the second decision phase.
DISCUSSION
The literature describing decision making processes has specified a
number of different decision rules which are used by decision makers.
These rules are most often applied to incomplete information, that is,
most decisions are made without a complete search for all the relevant
information of a decision task. This finding makes it clear that algebraic
models can only provide surface descriptions of the cognitive activity
taking place during a decision process because most of these models
assume complete information search.
It has also been found that the more attributes and alternatives there are
in a decision problem, the smaller the percentage of investigated aspects.
This finding implies that the more alternatives and attributes there are, the
less the probability that an algebraic model has been used in arriving at a
decision. With the number of aspects held constant, an increase in the
number of attributes decreased the percentage of investigated aspects more
than a corresponding increase in the number of alternatives. Increasing the
number of alternatives also decreased the proportion of within-attribute
comparisons in a decision process.
Some investigators have shown that decision makers tend to favor the
use of certain decision rules across problems. However, there is still an
almost total lack of data cross-validating this finding, and thus it is difficult
to generalize over different types of decision problems. When studying
decision making one must keep in mind that different subjects perceive
the same objective decision problem in different ways and that they react
in relation to their own perceptions. Therefore, identical rules may result
in different final decisions for different subjects.
Process tracing techniques can be fruitfully applied in studies of decision making. However, the use of verbal protocols or information search
patterns does not release the researcher from the burden of constructing
theories or models. In principle, a verbal protocol is nothing very different
from other types of empirical data and does not offer the researcher a
theory for a subject's decision making process. The protocol provides
