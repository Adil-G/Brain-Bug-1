and Production 


More than most other economic activities,
innovation and technological change depend
upon new economic knowledge. Thus, Paul
Romer (1986), Paul Krugman (1991a, b),
and Gene Grossman and Elhanan Helpman
( 1991), among others, have focused on the
role that spillovers of economic knowledge
across agents and firms play in generating increasing returns and ultimately economic
growth. In fact, several recent studies have
identified the existence of spatially-mediated
knowledge spillovers. An important finding of
Adam B. Jaffe (1989), Zoltan Acs et al.
( 1992, 1994), and Feldman ( 1994a, b) is that
investment in R&D by private corporations
and universities "spills over" for third-party
firms to exploit. If the ability to receive knowledge spillovers is influenced by distance from
the knowledge source, then geographic concentration should be observed, especially in
industries where knowledge spillovers are
likely to play a more important role. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to
which industrial activity clusters spatially and
to link this geographic concentration to the existence of knowledge externalities. Of course,

as Jaffe et al. (1993) point out, one obvious
explanation why innovative activity in some
industries tends to cluster geographically more
than in other industries is that the location of
production is more concentrated spatially.
Thus, in explaining why the propensity for innovative activity to cluster geographically varies across industries, we need first to explain,
and then to control for, the geographic concentration of the location of production.
As Alfred Marshall (1920) and, later
Krugman (l99lb) argue, there may be geographic boundaries to information flows or
knowledge spillovers, particularly tacit knowledge, among the firms in an industry. Although the cost of transmitting information
may be invariant to distance, presumably the
cost of transmitting knowledge rises with distance. That is, proximity and location matter.
While there is considerable evidence supporting the existence of knowledge spillovers, neither Jaffe ( 1989), Jaffe et al. ( 1993), nor Acs
et al. ( 1992, 1994), and Feldman ( 1994a) actually examine the propensity for innovative
activity to cluster spatially. But implicit in the
knowledge production function model is the
assumption that innovative activity should
concentrate geographically in those industries
where the direct knowledge-generating inputs
are the greatest and where knowledge spillovers are the most prevalent. No one, to date,
has examined the underlying propensity for industrial activity to cluster spatially. While one
of the central themes in the industrial organization literature is to explain the degree of concentration of economic activity within an
industry (F. M. Scherer and David Ross,
1990), the focus has typically been on the extent of dispersion across different enterprises
and establishments within a single spatial
unit-the country. The emerging importance
of location as a unit of observation argues for
examining both production and innovation
within a geographic context. We empirically

test for the importance of geographic location
to different types of industries by linking the
geographic concentration in manufacturing industries to industry specific characteristics,
most notably the relative importance of knowledge spillovers.
In the following section of this paper, we
examine the spatial distribution of innovative
activity as well as the geographic concentration of production. An empirical model is
specified in Section 11, and the results are
presented in Section III. In the final section,
we provide a summary and conclusion. The
empirical evidence suggests that, even after
controlling for the degree of geographic concentration in production, innovative activity
tends to cluster more in industries where
knowledge spillovers play a decisive role. Although such industries also tend to exhibit a
greater geographic concentration of production, the results suggest that the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster is more attributable to the role of knowledge spillovers and
not merely the geographic concentration of
production.
I. The Spatial Distribution of Innovation
and Production

To measure the spatial distribution of innovative activity we rely on the most recent
and most ambitious major data base that provides a direct measure of innovative activity.
The United States Small Business Administration (the Small Business Administration's Innovation Data Base or the SBIDB) compiled
a data base of 8,074 commercial innovations
introduced in the United States in 1982. A private firm, The Futures Group, compiled the
data and performed quality control analyses
for the United States Small Business Administration. A data base consisting of innovations
by four-digit standard industrial classification
(SIC) industries was formed from the new
product announcement sections in over 100
technology, engineering and trade journals
that span every industry.' These data were

' A detailed description of the U.S. Small Business Administration's Innovation Citation Data Base can be found
in chapter two of Acs and Audretsch (1990), as well as

used by Acs and Audretsch (1988, 1990) to
analyze the relationships between firm size
and technological change, and market structure and technological change, and by Acs et
al. ( 1992, 1994), Feldman ( 1994a, b), and
Feldman and Richard Florida (1994) to examine the geography of innovation.
We adopt the state as the spatial unit of observation. While this is at best a crude proxy
of the relevant economic market, it does have
one obvious appeal other than that it conforms
to a number of data sources-the most relevant unit of policy-making is at the level of the
state. Still, states are certainly not an entirely
satisfactory unit of observation for the analysis
of spatial phenomena. The analyses of spatial
processes are handicapped by a lack of data
for what might be considered to be the ideal
observation. Certainly considerable progress
would be made if data sources identifying innovation activity at the city or county level
were made available.
Using the citation data base described
above, an innovation is attributed to the state
in which the establishment responsible for the
development of that innovation is located.
Some innovations are, in fact, developed by
subsidiaries or divisions of companies with
headquarters in other states. Since headquarters may announce new product innovations,
the data base discriminates between the location of the innovating establishment and
the location of the larger, innovating entity
(Edwards and Gordon, 1984). For our purposes, the state identifier of the establishment
is used to investigate the spatial distribution of
innovation. Of the total number of innovations
recorded in the data base, 4,200 were manufacturing innovations with information specifying location.'
Figure 1 shows the distribution of innovations by states. California is the state in which

'As Krugman (1991b p. 57) emphasizes, "States
aren't really the right geographical units," because of the
lack of concordance between economic markets and political units.
' The SBIDB contains a total of 4,476 innovations in
manufacturing industries. Of these, there are 276 innovations which are not used because they were developed by
establishments outside the United States or did not have
complete location information.

the greatest number of innovations were registered, followed by New York, New Jersey,
and Massachusetts. A particularly striking feature shown in Figure 1 is that the bulk of innovative activity in the United States occurs
on the coasts, and especially in California and
in New England. By contrast, no innovative
activity is registered in certain Midwestern
states such as North Dakota, South Dakota,

Of course, simply comparing the absolute amount of
innovative activity across states ignores the fact that the
manufacturing base of some states is larger than others.
Presumably one of the most important determinants of innovative activity is the location of manufacturing activity.
Additional information on the geographic distribution of
the innovation data can be found in Feldman ( 1994b) and
Feldman and Florida ( 1994).

nois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are not at all
particularly innovative. Thus, while the location of manufacturing activity may explain the
spatial distribution of innovative activity to
some degree, it is certainly not the only factor.
This presentation of the aggregate geographic distribution of innovative activity in
the United States obscures the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster spatially within
specific industries. Thus, the distribution of innovative activity for the seven most innovative
four-digit standard industrial classification
(SIC) industries is shown in Table 1. A striking result is that the spatial concentration of
innovative activity in particular industries is
considerably greater than for all of manufacturing. For example, in the computer industry,
342 of the 821 innovations recorded, or 41.7
percent, are in California. And an additional
10 percent are recorded in Massachusetts.

" The SIC is the standard industrial classification used in the U.S. Small Business Administration's Innovation Citation
Data Base.
The total number of innovations recorded in the four-digit industry is listed in parentheses.

Thus, these two states alone account for over
one half of all the innovations in the computer
industry. At the same time, the last column
indicates that innovations in the computer industry accounted for slightly more than one
third of all the innovations in California and a
little more than one fifth of all innovations in
Massachusetts. Similarly, nearly 40 percent of
the 127 innovations in the drug industry (pharmaceuticals) were recorded in New Jersey,
while an additional 14 percent were made in
New York. Thus, over one-half of pharmaceutical innovations were in the New Jersey-New
York area. At the same time, pharmaceutical
innovations account for over one tenth of all
innovations registered in New Jersey.
To measure the extent to which manufacturing in specific industries is concentrated
geographically and the extent to which innovative activity tends to cluster spatially, we

follow Krugman's (1991b) example and calculate Gini coefficients for the geographic
concentration of innovative activity and for the
location of man~facturing.~
Table 2 provides

'The locational Gini coefficients for production are
based on industry value-added. We calculate the amount
of value-added in an industry and state divided by the
national value-added for the industry. This ratio is normalized by the state share of total manufacturing valueadded in order to account for the overall distribution of
manufacturing activity. An industry which is not geographically concentrated more than is reflected by the
overall distribution of manufacturing value-added would
have a coefficient of 0. The closer the industry coefficient
is to 1, the more geographically concentrated the industry
would be. Cases in which state or industry data have been
suppressed are omitted from the analysis. The Gini coefficients for innovation are based on the count of innovation
in a state and industry and are calculated in a similar way.

the weighted mean Gini coefficients for valueadded, employment, and innovative activity
within each broad two-digit SIC manufacturing sector. Those sectors exhibiting the greatest geographic concentration of manufacturing
activity include primary metals, transportation
equipment, textiles, food and beverages,
leather and chemicals. By contrast, those manufacturing sectors exhibiting the highest propensity for innovative activity to cluster
spatially include transportation equipment, instruments, and electronics. That the propensity
for innovative activity to spatially cluster cannot be simply explained by the geographic
concentration of the location of manufacturing
activity is evident from Table 2. This points to
the importance of controlling for the geographic concentration of production in explaining the propensity for innovative activity
to spatially cluster.

II. The Model
Why should innovations tend to cluster spatially more in some industries than in other

cally concentrated in some industries than in
others. This raises the issue of endogeny. Jaffe
et al. ( 1993) identifv two related critical issues which must beconsidered in trying to
identify why the propensity for innovative activity to cluster spatially varies across industries. First, the extent to which the location
of production is geographically concentrated
must be controlled for, so that the relevant
question becomes: even after accounting for
the geographic concentration of the production location, why does the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster vary across industries? And second, in trying to account for
the degree to which the location of production
is geographically concentrated, an important
factor is the role which knowledge spillovers
play in the industry. It is only after the geographic concentration of production has been
controlled for, that the degree to which innovative activity clusters spatially can be addressed. Thus, to explain the propensity for
innovative activity to cluster spatially we begin with the extent to which production is
geographically concentrated.
While it is not possible to directly measure
the extent to which knowledge externalities
exist, as Kenneth J. Arrow (1962) and
Krugman (1991a) point out, it is possible to
identify industries in which new economic
knowledge plays a relatively more important
role. This is done on the basis of the industry
R&D intensity, or R&D-sales ratio. The crucial assumption we make here is Arrow's
(1962) argument that knowledge spillovers
are more important in, and reflected at least to
some degree by, highly R&D-intensive industries. By contrast, such knowledge externalities, while perhaps still present, play a less
important role where the creation of new economic knowledge, as reflected by R&D intensity, is negligible. Thus, the location of
production would be expected to be more concentrated in those industries where knowledge
spillovers are prevalent, that is in industries
which are R&D intensive.
Similarly, skilled workers endowed with a
high level of human capital are a mechanism
by which economic knowledge is transmitted.
The greater the extent to which the industry

work force is composed of skilled workers, the
more important knowledge spillovers are
likely to be. Thus, industries which rely on a
higher component of skilled workers should
tend to exhibit a greater tendency towards spatial concentration of industrial location.
Of course, while knowledge externalities
may be important in influencing the degree to
which the location of production is spatially
concentrated, they are certainly not the only
factors. Krugman ( 1991a) points out that the
extent to which the location of production is
geographically concentrated will be shaped by
transportation costs. Transportation costs are
inversely related to the mean distance shipped,
so that a higher value of transportation costs
should be associated with a lower geographic
concentration of production. Similarly, industries which are highly dependent upon natural
resource inputs are also going to tend to be
geographically concentrated-presumably
close to the source of those inputs. Augustus

17.5946

13.851

Loesch (1954) and Victor R. Fuchs (1962)
argue that firms in industries with a high dependency on natural resource inputs will tend
to locate in close proximity to those resources.
Therefore, a higher content of natural resource
inputs in an industry should result in a greater
geographic concentration of the location of
production. In addition, Robert C. Shelburne
and Robert W. Bednarzik ( 1993) argue that
industries which are more capital-intensive
will tend to be geographically concentrated,
since production will be concentrated among
fewer enterprises. That is, as capital intensity
and the importance of scale economies rise,
fewer large establishments will be able to exist
at a level of output in excess of the minimum
efficient scale (MES) level of output.
The main hypothesis of this paper suggests
that innovative activity will tend to cluster in
industries where new economic knowledge
plays an especially important role. In estimating the main influences on the geographic

concentration of innovation we consider three
sources of economic knowledge-industry
R&D, skilled labor, and the size of the pool of
basic science for a specific industry. Conceptually, there are great differences in the scope
and commercial applicability of university research undertaken in different fields. Academic research will not necessarily result in
useful knowledge for every industry; however,
scientific knowledge from certain academic
departments is expected to be more important
for certain industries than for others. To capture the relevant pool of knowledge, academic
departments are assigned to industries using
the survey of industrial R&D managers by
Richard C. Levin et al. ( 1987) .6 For example,
basic scientific research in medicine, biology,
chemistry and chemical engineering is found
to be relevant for product innovation in drugs
(SIC 2834).
HI. The Results

Descriptive statistics for the variables used
to estimate the model are provided in Table 3,

To measure the relevance of a discipline to an industry
a survey of industrial R&D managers was used. The question was asked, "How relevant were the basic sciences to
technical progress in this line of business over the past
10- 15 years?" The survey uses a Likert scale of 1 to 7 to
assess relevance. We consider relevant science to be those
academic departments that are rated with a relevance
greater than a value of 5 on the scale.

and Table 4 provides the correlation matrix.
There are 163 four-digit SIC industries for
which comparable data for the different measures could be compiled.
Table 5 presents the regression results using
ordinary-least-squares (OLS) estimates. Table
6 presents the results estimating the system of
equations using three-stage least squares
(3SLS) .7 The statistical results are generally
quite consistent between the OLS and 3SLS
methods of estimation.
In equation ( 1) of Table 5, the positive and
statistically significant coefficient of the measure of natural resource utilization suggests
that the degree to which inputs in an industry
are composed of natural resources clearly
tends to shape the geographic concentration of
production. Resource dependent industries
tend to be more geographically concentrated.
The negative and statistically significant coefficient on the scale measure suggests that industries tend to be less, and not more,
geographically concentrated when scale economies play a more important role. This result
emerges even after controlling for the size of
the industry. One explanation for this result

'The system of equations was also estimated using
two-stage least-squares estimation. The differences in the
standard errors indicate the presence of cross-equation
correlation. Thus, we estimate the model with 3SLS. The
instruments used include all of the exogenous variables
appearing on the right-hand side of the equations in the
model.

Columns (3) and (6) provide the unrestricted regression results. When the regression estimated for the Gini of
production in column (2) is compared with the estimate of the unrestricted regression in column (3). the F test statistic
(2,156) of 0.087 is computed for the overidentifying restrictions. Similarly, when the regression estimated for the Gini
of innovation in column (5) is compared to the estimate of the unrestricted regression in column (6), the F test statistic
(3,156) equals 2.662 for the overidentifying restrictions.

may be that this measure limits the size of the
market to the United States, but when many
manufacturing industries are global in scale,
this measure will be understated.
There is little ambiguity concerning the two
measures that are the primary focus of this paper-the relative importance of industry R&D
in an industry and the extent to which the labor
force is composed of skilled workers. The coefficient of industry R&D is positive and
clearly statistically significant, supporting the
hypothesis that industries where new economic knowledge tends to play a more important role will have a higher propensity to
cluster together. Similarly, industries where
skilled labor is relatively important also tend
to exhibit a greater degree of geographic concentration of production.
An alternative specification which includes
the Gini coefficient of innovation is presented
in equation (2) of Table 5. To the extent that
geographic proximity between R&D labs and

production facilities is important to gain the
benefits of R&D, we might expect that industries with closely clustered innovations may
also have closely clustered factories. However,
the coefficient of this variable cannot be considered to be statistically different from 0.
Equations (4) and (5) of Table 5 present
the OLS regression results estimating the Gini
coefficients of innovative activity across
states. Equation (4) indicates that, when the
extent to which production activity is geographically concentrated is not controlled for, the
coefficients of all three types of knowledgegenerating measures included-industry R&D,
skilled labor, and university research-are positive and statistically significant. However, industries in which new economic knowledge
plays a more important role also tend to exhibit
a greater degree of spatial concentration. That
is, without first controlling for the extent to
which the location of production is geographically concentrated, it is not at all clear whether

the greater propensity for innovative activity to
cluster in industries where knowledge spillovers are more prevalent is attributable to the
fact that knowledge externalities are more conducive to innovative activity or simply that the
firms are already located within a relatively
tight geographic area.
Thus, in equation (5) of Table 5, the Gini
measure of the value-added across states is included. The coefficient of this variable is statistically insignificant, but the coefficients of
the other explanatory variables remain virtually unchanged. Which is to say that, even after controlling for the extent to which the
location of production is geographically concentrated, the three knowledge-generating
variables are still found to have a significant
impact on the propensity for innovative activity to cluster spatially.
Table 6 presents the 3SLS method of estimation. In the first set of equations the Gini
coefficient of innovative activity across states
is endogenous in both equations. In the second
set of equations a fully specified simultaneous
version of the model is presented in which the
Gini coefficients of both innovative activity
and production are endogenously included.
Most impohantly, the propensity for innovative activity to spatially cluster is found to be

the result of new economic knowledge and not
merely the existing geographic concentration
of production.
The positive coefficients of industry R&D,
skilled labor, and university research, even after controlling for the degree of concentration
of production, using both the OLS and 3SLS
methods of estimation, are certainly consistent
with the following hypothesis. The propensity
for innovative activity to cluster will tend to
be higher in industries where new economic
knowledge plays a more important role. Presumably, it is in such industries where new
economic knowledge which generates innovative activity is transmitted tacitly through
what has been described as knowledge spillovers. Therefore, innovative activity is more
likely to occur within close geographic proximity to the source of that knowledge, be it a
university research laboratory, the research
and development department of a corporation,
or exposure to the knowledge embodied in a
skilled worker.
Industries where new economic knowledge
plays a more important role also tend to exhibit
a greater geographic concentration of production. However, based on the statistical results
reported above it appears that the propensity
for innovative activity to cluster spatially is

more attributable to the influence of knowledge spillovers and not merely the geographic
concentration of production.
IV. Conclusions

This paper examines the geography of innovation and production. In particular, by
examining the concentration of economic phenomena, we re-focus the lens from the usual
product dimension to a geographic or spatial
dimension. A key assumption we make in examining the link between knowledge spillovers in an industry and innovative activity
clustering spatially is that knowledge externalities are more prevalent in industries where
new economic knowledge plays a greater role.
New economic knowledge is captured by industry R&D, university R&D, and skilled
labor.
One obvious complication in testing for this
link is that innovative activity will be more
geographically concentrated in industries
where production is also geographically concentrated, simply because the bulk of firms are
located within close proximity. Even more
problematic, though, is the hypothesis that
new economic knowledge will tend to shape
the spatial distribution of production as well
as that of innovation. Indeed, we find that a
key determinant of the extent to which the location of production is geographically concentrated is the relative importance of new
economic knowledge in the industry. Even after controlling for the concentration of production we find evidence that industries in
which knowledge spillovers are more prevalent-that is where industry R&D, university
research and skilled labor are the most important-have a greater propensity for innovative
activity to cluster than industries where knowledge externalities are less important.
