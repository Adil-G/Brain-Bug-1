<-----Page 1----->Preface
This preliminary investigation into 4th pillar organizations in Canada was commissioned
by the Prime Minister’s Advisory Council on Science and Technology in July 2005. It
represents a first effort to characterize 4th pillar organizations on a conceptual level and to
estimate the nature and size of the population of 4th pillar organizations in Canada. The
objective of the report is to lay the groundwork for a consideration of how the
government can leverage 4th pillar organizations as vehicles of increased innovation and
productivity, particularly among small and medium sized enterprises.
I would like to thank Brian Barge and Ian Wong for reading drafts of this report and
providing helpful suggestions for improving it. I would also like to thank Ian Wong for
his invaluable contribution in preparing Appendix A. The tables from Statistics Canada

<-----Page 3----->Executive Summary
Four sectors contribute to Canada’s national system of innovation: industry, government,
universities, and nonprofit organizations. 4th pillar organizations are distinguished from
other nonprofit organizations by the fact that they work to increase the innovativeness
and competitiveness of Canadian firms by engaging all three of the other pillars of
innovation. 4th pillar organizations are defined as innovation enablers and multipliers that
work to promote, support, or conduct science, technology, or business-practice based
innovation that results in new products, services, or processes deployed by companies.
4th pillar organizations such as R&D institutes, industry associations, economic
development organizations and other nonprofit organizations work closely with private
sector firms, facilitating innovation in a number of ways. First, they provide a forum in
which related firms can learn from one another. Second, they connect firms to
knowledge resources and opportunities outside their immediate purview, for example
knowledge in universities and opportunities in foreign markets. Third, they facilitate the
collaborative development of new products, services, and processes involving
universities and governments in addition to private sector firms. And finally, in some
cases, nonprofit organizations have sufficient expertise to undertake innovative projects
on behalf of their private sector stakeholders.
As illustrated in Figure 1, below, this report distinguishes between active 4th pillar
organizations that are industry-led, supported by government, and that engage with
university researchers, and potential 4th pillar organizations which do not engage with all
three of the other pillars of innovation as described, or which are not structured as
nonprofit organizations. Hospitals, universities, colleges, and other educational and
training institutions are excluded from consideration as 4th pillar organizations,
notwithstanding their critical role in innovation.

<-----Page 4----->The diversity of active and potential 4th pillar organizations is commensurate with the
diversity of the for-profit firms that they serve and the ways in which they serve them.
There are 4th pillar organizations for every region and industry in the country, and they
range from those that work to build connections between sophisticated firms and
university researchers, to those that work to help struggling small firms cope with the
adoption of new technology and business practices. The diversity of nonprofits is a
requirement of their effectiveness. Their for-profit constituents demand relevancy and
specific knowledge in their discretionary institutional partners and innovative firms cite
nonprofit organizations as important sources of ideas and as collaborators in innovation
(Statistics Canada, 2003). Government would be unable to match this diversity without
an unreasonable increase in its size and complexity. Of the approximately 161,000
nonprofits in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2005a), I estimate that 10,500 of these are active
or potential 4th pillar organizations.
In many cases an industry association or economic development organization may be the
only non-transactional organization with which a given small firm engages, and so such
organizations represent the best opportunity for government to reach small firms. But
like their small firm constituents, many 4th pillar organizations face resource shortages,
and the more transformative the activities in which they engage, the more acutely the
resource shortages are felt. Activities that are non-customized, near term, local, and not
knowledge intensive (e.g. networking events) can be undertaken with relatively modest
resources. But activities that are one-on-one, intended to make a difference over the long
term, international, or science or technology-based require government support. 4th pillar
organizations can sustain their existence with the former type of activity but their ability
to contribute fully to the innovativeness of Canadian firms is linked to their ability to
provide high value added assistance of the type that relies upon the support of
government.
The federal government presently accommodates the diversity of 4th pillar organizations
by providing them with multiple entry points to its resources and expertise. Almost every
government department and agency provides funding for nonprofits, the notable funders
of 4th pillar organizations being Industry Canada and its multiple affiliated agencies,
Natural Resources Canada, and International Trade Canada. While this approach may
yield certain benefits in terms of building connections between nonprofits and
government, these benefits are offset by the downsides. Most importantly, the current
approach fails to recognize 4th pillar organizations as an important class of contributors to
innovation and prosperity. Dispersed funding may be awarded inconsistently, may be
perceived as arbitrary, and is not transparent. It creates problems for the nonprofit
organizations insofar as funding opportunities are unpredictable, and their pursuit
consumes significant organizational resources that would be better spent serving
innovation and commercial objectives. Finally the dispersed approach minimizes
opportunities for learning about what types of approaches to industry assistance work
best and what types of impacts they achieve. Imagine how burdensome and unproductive
it would be if university researchers appealed to multiple government departments for
funding instead of being dealt with collectively through the granting councils.

v

<-----Page 5----->This report suggests consolidated and increased funding for 4th pillar organizations, both
active and potential. Specifically, the four recommendations are:

4.

Provide consolidated and sustained federal government support for active 4th
pillar organizations. Create an agency or foundation to integrate funding for
active 4th pillar organizations and implement a national, competitive, peerreviewed process to provide funding on the basis of excellence and fit with
national priorities.
Provide consolidated funding for potential 4th pillar organizations to involve them
as full participants in Canada’s national system of innovation.
Provide increased funding for all 4th pillar organizations.
Investigate the possibility of spinning-off certain government institutions into
nonprofit organizations.

As shown in Figure 2, below, it is recommended that annual funding for 4th pillar
organizations grow over three years to a total of $550 per year, $450 million of which is
reallocated funding and $100 million of which is new funding.

Figure 2: Recommended Funding Levels by Year
The primary benefit of working through 4th pillar organizations is that is it leverages the
knowledge and capabilities of Canadians. It distributes the problem of how to make
Canadian firms more innovative and productive across groups of business people and
academics that can design targeted programs that address important needs and
opportunities. A comprehensive federal program will spur the development of many
worthwhile initiatives. Those that don’t receive federal government funding may be able
to proceed in reduced form without funding or with alternative funding.
Another benefit is that consolidated funding for 4th pillar organizations will create
legitimacy and visibility for the class of organizations. This will lead to a number of
second order benefits such as an improved ability on the part of such organizations to
attract, retain, and develop the careers of their employees. The major risks to government
of centralized funding for 4th pillar organizations are those commonly associated with
interventionism. By centralizing and thereby increasing the visibility of its funding for

vi

<-----Page 6----->4th pillar organizations, the federal government risks attracting criticism for
overspending, spending on industry subsidies, and spending on organizations viewed by
some as unnecessary to the conduct of business. These risks are contained as this report
recommends new funding of only $100 million, with a three year ramp up. The risk of
criticism can be further mitigated by ensuring that the criteria for funding are appropriate
and sufficiently challenging as to ensure that only the most important and best-managed
organizations are funded.
4th pillar organizations are a means by which the Canadian government can promote the
innovativeness and productivity of a broad range of geographically distributed
companies. In particular, 4th pillar organizations are well equipped to help small and
medium sized firms adopt advanced technologies and business practices. No amount of
reduced taxes or tax credits can help an organization that is unsure of what it should do or
one that has insufficient resources to meaningfully invest in prototype development or
global marketing. 4th pillar organizations are distinguished from monetary incentives by
the fact that they are composed of knowledgeable people who work with firms to
motivate them to adapt and innovate and give them the tools to do so. They are the
government’s best channel to the small and medium sized firms upon which our nation’s
prosperity depends.

Introduction

Private sector for-profit firms are the most significant and most direct contributors to
wealth creation in Canada. A single large or growing firm makes a more significant
contribution than does a single small or declining firm and the challenge for Canada is to
ensure that all firms have the tools they need to achieve growth-enabling sustained
competitive advantage. In Canada this challenge is made more complex by the diversity
of firms which range from large and sophisticated multinationals, to small firms that rely
primarily on local customers for their revenues; from firms that operate in asset-intensive
industries such as mining, to firms that operate in knowledge-intensive industries such as
software; and from firms that operate in large urban centres, to firms that operate in small
towns and rural areas. What can the federal government do to ensure that all Canadian
firms, whatever their attributes and circumstances, are well equipped to innovate and
compete in today’s global markets?
A key to the answer is provided by Canadian firms themselves. In 2003, Statistics
Canada surveyed firms in a number of information technology, professional service,
natural resource, and transportation industries to better understand how they innovate. To
innovate firms need access to new knowledge and ideas, and to partners that have
resources and capabilities that are complementary to their own. Innovative Canadian
firms1 cite customers, suppliers, competitors, and their industry associations as important
sources of ideas for innovation2. Innovative firms also cite industry associations and
private non-profit research institutes in addition to customers, suppliers, competitors,
universities, and federal and provincial laboratories as collaborators in innovation.
According to Canadian firms, nonprofit organizations play an important role in their
efforts to innovate (Statistics Canada, 2003).
This is not surprising as industry associations, research institutes, and other nonprofit
organizations work closely with private sector firms, facilitating innovation in a number
of ways. First, they provide a forum in which related firms can learn from one another.
Second, they connect firms to knowledge resources and opportunities outside their
immediate purview, for example knowledge in universities and opportunities in foreign
markets. Third, they facilitate the collaborative development of new products, services,
processes, and capabilities involving universities and governments in addition to private
sector firms. And finally, in some cases, nonprofit organizations have sufficient expertise
to undertake innovative projects on behalf of their private sector stakeholders.
This report explores the diversity of innovation-enabling nonprofit organizations and
makes recommendations designed to improve the ability of such organizations to
contribute to Canada’s national system of innovation and prosperity. Throughout the
report I refer to innovation-enabling nonprofit organizations as 4th pillar organizations,
recognizing the fact that they complement the three pillars of industry, government, and
1

According to the Statistics Canada definition, innovative firms are firms that have introduced a new or
significantly improved product or processes during the last three years (Statistics Canada, 2003).

The most innovative Canadian firms, the ‘world first’ innovators, also cite universities as important
sources of ideas (Statistics Canada, 2003).

<-----Page 8----->universities by bringing together diverse stakeholders to address important challenges and
opportunities (Barge, 2002).
As a subset of nonprofit organizations, 4th pillar organizations share the attributes of
nonprofits identified by the National Survey of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations
(Statistics Canada, 2005a) as they are:
•
•
•
•
•

Non-governmental – institutionally separate from government
Non-profit distributing – do not distribute surpluses to their owners or directors
Self-governing – independent and able to regulate their own activities
Voluntary – benefit to some degree from voluntary contributions of time or money
Incorporated – formerly incorporated or registered under provincial or federal
legislation.

4th pillar organizations are distinguished from other nonprofit organizations by the fact
that they work to increase the innovativeness and competitiveness of Canadian firms by
engaging all three of the other pillars of innovation. This report distinguishes between
active 4th pillar organizations that are industry-led, supported by government, and that
engage with university researchers, and potential 4th pillar organizations which do not
engage with all three of the other pillars of innovation as described, or which are not
structured as nonprofit organizations. Hospitals, universities, colleges, and other
educational and training institutions are excluded from consideration as 4th pillar
organizations, notwithstanding their critical role in innovation.
The diversity of active and potential 4th pillar organizations is commensurate with the
diversity of the for-profit firms that they serve and the ways in which they serve them.
There are 4th pillar organizations for every region and industry in the country, and they
range from those that work to build connections between sophisticated firms and
university researchers, to those that work to help struggling small firms cope with the
adoption of new technology and business practices. The diversity of nonprofits is a
requirement of their effectiveness. Their for-profit constituents demand relevancy and
specific knowledge in their discretionary institutional partners. Government would be
unable to match this diversity without an unreasonable increase in its size and
complexity.
The federal government presently accommodates the diversity of 4th pillar organizations
by providing them with multiple entry points to its resources and expertise. Almost every
government department and agency provides funding for nonprofits, the notable funders
of 4th pillar organizations being Industry Canada and its multiple affiliated agencies,
Natural Resources Canada, and International Trade Canada. While this approach may
yield certain benefits in terms of building connections between nonprofits and
government, these benefits are offset by the downsides. The current approach is
inconsistent, may be perceived as arbitrary, and is not transparent. It creates problems for
the nonprofit organizations insofar as funding opportunities are unpredictable, and their
pursuit consumes significant organizational resources that would be better spent serving
innovation and commercial objectives. Finally the dispersed approach minimizes

best and what types of impacts they achieve. Imagine how burdensome and unproductive
it would be if university researchers appealed to multiple government departments for
funding instead of being dealt with collectively through the granting councils. Note also
that the existence of the granting councils does not prevent university researchers from
building connections with specific departments as appropriate. This report advocates an
improved understanding of the important role of 4th pillar organizations in our national
system of innovation and a more rational approach to their funding that will allow them
to better serve their private sector members.
The remainder of this report is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a typology of
active and potential 4th pillar organizations that shows how the 4th pillar concept can be
used to better understand the actual and potential contributions to innovation of a variety
of nonprofit, government, and university organizations in Canada. Section 2 is supported
by Appendix A that lists 100 active and potential 4th pillar organizations in Canada.
Section 3 presents the highlights of six case studies of 4th pillar organizations and on the
basis of these describes the challenges that 4th pillar organizations face and the
opportunity for a substantial increase in their effectiveness. The case studies themselves
are found in Appendix B. Section 4 is more theoretical and builds on recent
examinations of nonprofit organizations and national systems of innovation to examine
why we have been so slow to acknowledge and leverage the contributions of 4th pillar
organizations, and Section 5 presents recommendations for government action. A
conclusion identifies the contributions and limitations of the report and makes
suggestions for further study.

An Overview of 4th Pillar Organizations in Canada

Four sectors contribute to Canada’s national system of innovation: industry, government,
universities, and nonprofit organizations. 4th pillar organizations are a subset of nonprofit
participants in the innovation system. 4th pillar organizations are nonprofit innovation
enablers and multipliers that work to promote, support, or conduct science, technology, or
business-practice based innovation that results in new products, services, or processes
deployed by companies.
Figure 1, below, shows four types of active 4th pillar organizations and eight types of
potential 4th pillar organizations. Active 4th pillar organizations exhibit all the attributes
of 4th pillar organizations while potential 4th organizations display a subset of the
attributes. Active 4th pillar organizations are nonprofits that are industry-led, supported
by government, and that engage with university researchers, while potential 4th pillar
organizations are nonprofits that do not engage with all three of the other pillars of
innovation as described, or are university- or government-owned initiatives. Proximity to
or distance from the ideal type of 4th pillar organization is not an indication of an
organization’s merit. While this report argues for the importance of the contributions of
4th pillar organizations it recognizes that excellence and mediocrity is exhibited by all
types of organizations. Each of the 12 types of 4th pillar organizations is described
below.
Active 4th pillar organizations
1. Balanced 4th pillar organizations.
A few active 4th pillar organizations are close to the ideal3 type of 4th pillar organization.
They are industry-led, receive significant government support, and engage substantively
with university researchers. This is a difficult balancing act as collaborative research is
time consuming and subject to high spillovers, and so the private sector leadership is
typically dependent upon government funding. Examples of such organizations are
PRECARN (Precompetitive Applied Research Network), an industrial research
consortium that promotes and supports collaborative research in intelligent systems, and
CANARIE (Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry, and
Education) a similar organization that works to accelerate Canada's advanced internet
development and use by facilitating the widespread adoption of faster, more efficient
networks. Both PRECARN and CANARIE are supported by Industry Canada.
2. Fourth pillar organizations with strong ties to industry.
Some 4th pillar organizations exhibit strong ties to industry. In some cases stronger ties
to industry or the user community are the result of reduced government funding. For
example, PAPRICAN (the Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada) has seen its
federal government funding reduced to approximately 20% of its annual revenues and
3

To repeat, ‘ideal’ means idealized or conceptualized type. It is not a comment on an organization’s merit
or the average merit of the organizations in the class.

4

<-----Page 11----->Figure 1: Active and potential 4th pillar organizations
contributions from member companies increased to almost 70%. While CEFRIO (Centre
francophone d’informatisation des organizations) conducts its activities in support of both
private and public sector organizations, it is similar to PAPRICAN insofar as ties with its
user community have strengthened at the same time as its government funding has been
reduced. CEFRIO now receives approximately 30% of its revenues from the Quebec
government and up to 70% from its user community. Both PAPRICAN and CEFRIO
also have strong ties to universities.
3. 4th pillar organizations with strong ties to universities.
CMC Microsystems is a federally incorporated nonprofit corporation that provides
microsystems researchers with industry-calibre design resources, access to state-of-theart manufacturing technologies, and support services. While the motivation for CMC
Microsystems came from industry (i.e. for universities to produce more highly qualified

5

<-----Page 12----->graduates) and while industry continues to play a strong role in its activities, CMC’s
board of directors is populated by a balance of industry and university representatives.
Importantly, CMC effects its contribution to the innovation system by providing tools,
equipment, and access to capabilities to university faculty members and graduate
students.
4. 4th pillar organizations with strong ties to government.
While the Alberta Research Council is currently a nonprofit, it was created as a
provincial government organization in 1921 and only became a nonprofit in 1999. Its
sister provincial research organizations, i.e. the Saskatchewan Research Council, the
Industrial Technology Centre in Manitoba, the Centre de recherché industrielle du
Quebec, and the Research Productivity Council in New Brunswick are either provincial
crown corporations or provincial government agencies (i.e. they are not nonprofit
organizations).
Potential 4th pillar organizations
5. Industry associations.
Industry associations promote the competitiveness and innovativeness of their industry
members but do not typically engage with university researchers nor are they typically
supported by government. The Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association (APMA)
and the Excellence in Manufacturing Consortium (EMC) are examples.
6. Professional societies and labour unions.
Professional societies and labour unions such as the Canadian Medical Association, the
Society of Professional Engineers, or the Canadian Auto Workers union serve individuals
rather than the companies or organizations with which they are associated. They are
associated with universities and colleges insofar as these institutions professional training
and are not typically supported by governments.
7. Economic think tanks.
Economic think tanks work on the interface between industry, government, and
universities. Examples include the Conference Board of Canada which does not receive
government support at present but that has a significant internal research capacity. Other
nonprofit organizations that offer economic perspectives include The Fraser Institute and
the Canada Council for Chief Executives, neither of which are supported by government.
8. University-led initiatives.
An example is the Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE) initiative. Many NCEs are
governed by nonprofit organizations and benefit from the participation of industry. But
they are essentially driven by university researchers as evidenced by the high status of

6

<-----Page 13----->their scientific directors and by the high proportion of funding coming from the
government.
9. Medical and other foundations.
Medical and other foundations are part of the national system of innovation insofar as
they contribute both to the funding of research and to the adoption of new products and
services. Medical foundations do not have strong connections to companies and may feel
that having strong industry connections would compromise their ability to achieve their
mandate. The Heart and Stroke Foundation is an example. Government-sponsored
foundations such as GenomeCanada also limit the influence of industry with a view
keeping the public interest paramount.
10. Regional economic development organizations.
Economic development organizations generally don’t work with universities,
notwithstanding the fact that universities may be among their membership, and so are
classified as potential 4th pillar organizations, relatively distant from universities. Some
economic development organizations such as the Ottawa Centre for Research and
Innovation (OCRI) strive to involve themselves substantively with universities but this is
difficult given the modest level of support they receive from governments and the
consequent lack of an internal research capability.
11. University owned initiatives.
University technology transfer offices are an example of a university owned initiative that
has a potentially strong impact on the national system of innovation. They are classified
as potential 4th pillar organizations because they are not governed as nonprofits and they
are not industry led. An exception is Parteq, the technology transfer office of Queen’s
University, which is structured as a nonprofit.
12. Government owned initiatives.
In theory, organizations that are part of government, or that are crown corporations, may
benefit from more assured funding and the commensurate ability to engage in public
good activities with low private yields and high public spillovers, but may lack the
flexibility of more autonomous organizations. In practice it’s not clear that government
ownership always translates into government financial support. The Saskatchewan
Research Council is a provincial research organization that is a crown corporation of the
government of Saskatchewan and that receives only about 25% of its annual revenues
from the government of Saskatchewan. This is proportionally less government support
than that received by the nonprofit Alberta Research Council that receives approximately
40% of its annual revenues from the government of Alberta4.

4

In both cases the figures for government funding do not include government contracts for services.

7

<-----Page 14----->Not discussed in this report are nonprofit organizations that behave much like firms and
that in some respects compete with firms. An example is OneWorld Health, a nonprofit
pharmaceutical company with a mission to develop safe, effective, and affordable new
medicines for people with infectious diseases in the developing world. Such
organizations do not work on behalf of multiple companies but rather compete with firms
using an alternative business model (Economist, 2005).
Table 1, below, lists the 4 types of active 4th pillar organizations and the eight types of
potential 4th pillar organizations described above. It characterizes them in terms of four
attributes, whether or not they are: industry led, engaged with university researchers,
partially financed by government, and governed as nonprofit organizations.

<-----Page 16----->Total number of active and potential 4th pillar organizations in Canada
It is difficult to get an estimate of the total number of 4th pillar organizations in Canada as
the concept is in its early stages of definition and no surveys have been undertaken.
Nevertheless, using recent surveys of nonprofit organizations in general, approximate
numbers can be derived.
There are estimated to be a total of 161,000 nonprofit organizations in Canada and of
these 8,483 are classified as Business and professional associations and unions, i.e.
organizations that promote, regulate, or safeguard business, professional, or labour
interests (Statistics Canada, 2005a). This corresponds to four types of potential 4th pillar
organizations identified in Figure 1: industrial associations (Type 5), professional
societies and labour unions (Type 6), economic think tanks (Type 7), and economic
development organizations (Type 10). While this figure provides some indication of the
total number of potential 4th pillar organizations in Canada, it excludes several of the
types identified in this report.
First it excludes active 4th pillar organizations (Types 1, 2, 3, and 4) which are likely
classified under Education and research nonprofits (estimated to be a total of 100
organizations), second it excludes medical and other foundations (Type 9) which are
likely classified under Grant-making, fundraising and voluntarism promotion nonprofits
(estimated to be 1,500 organizations), and third it excludes university-led (Type 8),
university-owned (Type 11), and government-owned (Type 12) potential 4th pillar
organizations (estimated to be a total of 600 organizations). This brings the estimate of
the total number of 4th pillar organizations in Canada to 10,700. As university- and
government-owned initiatives are not nonprofit organizations, the total number of active
and potential 4th pillar organizations that are nonprofits is estimated to be 10,500. The
second column of Table 2 provides an estimate of the number of 4th pillar organizations
by type and the third column indicates the source of the estimate.

number of professional societies and labour unions. This number is estimated to be the total number of
business and professional associations and unions as per Statistics Canada (8,483 rounded to 8,500), less
the number of economic development organizations as per Goldenberg (3,000), divided by 2.

The Challenges and Opportunities Facing 4th Pillar Organizations

A closer examination of 4th pillar organizations in Canada is necessary for an
appreciation of their work and its impact, the challenges these organizations face in
contributing effectively to innovation in Canada, and the opportunity for enhancing
Canadian competitiveness by fully leveraging them. Six case studies of a diverse sample
of active and potential 4th pillar organizations support this examination. Reports of the
case studies are found in Appendix B and the organizations studied are:
APMA (Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association)
BC Biotech (BC Biotechnology Alliance Society)
CEFRIO (Centre francophone d'informatisation des organisations)
CMA (Canadian Medical Association)
EMC (Excellence in Manufacturing Consortium)
SRC (Saskatchewan Research Council)
Of the six organizations studied, only CEFRIO is classified as an active 4th pillar organization
(Type 2, close to industry). The APMA and EMC are both classified as industry associations
(Type 5), BC Biotech is classified as an economic development organization (Type 10), the
CMA is classified as a professional society (Type 6), and the SRC is classified as being a
government-owned initiative (Type 12). As stated earlier in the report, the classifications are
made according to an organization’s proximity to the ideal type of active 4th pillar organization
(Type 1, balanced 4th pillar) where ideal refers to idealized or conceptualized, not preferred. The
classification system says nothing about an organization’s worthiness.
Three themes emerged from the case studies: the difficulty of working with small
companies, the effect of reduced government funding, and the opportunity of closer
cooperation between the federal government and 4th pillar organizations.
The challenge of working with small firms
Small firms find it difficult to invest the time of senior management in activities designed
to improve their organizational effectiveness over the medium term. This is particularly
true of the small firms that are not founded on the basis of strong capabilities in science
or technology and that do not benefit from significant equity investments in the form of
angel or venture capital. These small firms are not ‘world first’ or ‘Canada first’
innovators; when these firms launch new products, services, and processes the
innovations are only new to the firms themselves8. As shown in Table 3, below, industry
associations are important sources of ideas for ‘firm first innovators’ (Statistics Canada,
2003). Almost 30% of firm first innovators cite industry associations as important
sources of ideas. Only customers and suppliers are cited more frequently as idea sources
by these firms.

Statistics Canada distinguishes between three types of innovators on the basis of the extent to which their
‘new’ products, processes, and services have not appeared earlier. The innovations of ‘world first’
innovators are new to the world, those of ‘Canada first’ innovators are new only within Canada, and those
of ‘firm first’ innovators are only new to the firm.

Firm first innovators respond best to organizations whose mandates correspond directly
to their needs. With their limited resources they are rarely able to benefit from the
offerings of universities, federal or provincial government laboratories, or private sector
research institutes. To effectively help such firms, the intervening organization must be a
trusted advisor that fully understands the firm’s circumstances, specifically its industry
and region. Little wonder then that there are estimated to be some 5,750 different
industry associations and economic development organizations in Canada (see Section 2
of this report).
Even when the intervening organization is created exclusively to assist such firms, it
finds the undertaking challenging. The APMA’s mandate is to engage in activities in
support of the welfare of the automotive parts manufacturers of Canada, located almost
exclusively in Ontario and Quebec. It cites its #1 difficulty as “getting through to small
companies”. APMA president Gerry Fedchun goes on to explain that small companies
operate in a very lean fashion and don’t have the spare talent to go to meetings. Similarly
the Excellence in Manufacturing Consortium (EMC) of Owen Sound, Ontario cites the
reluctance of small firms to commit time to EMC’s activities as its #1 difficulty. Scott
McNeil-Smith, the director of marketing and development at EMC, explains that new or
small manufacturing firms may be struggling with many challenges and are reluctant to
invest their time and energies in external processes when it’s unclear to them, prior to
participating, whether or not the external processes will be helpful. Part of EMC’s
approach to addressing this challenge is to visit each of their 550 member firms every
year. While this process is extremely time-intensive it contributes to the building of
informed and trusting relationships between EMC and its members.
The foregoing points to the difficulty of organizational change, especially for small firms
that are resource-constrained. Helping the diverse population of small firms in Canada

13

<-----Page 20----->achieve their potential is a time consuming process and the nonprofit organizations that
perform such work are making a strong contribution to Canada’s economy. They have
specific knowledge and capabilities that make them the first organization, aside from
customers and suppliers, to which small firms turn for ideas. These potential 4th pillar
organizations are the channel through which government can best reach and assist small
firms.
The impact of reduced government funding
The second theme to emerge from the case studies is the impact of reduced government
funding. Reduced government funding does not necessarily lead to the demise of 4th
pillar organizations but rather to a shift in their mandates. With limited government
funding, 4th pillar organizations must focus on revenue-generating activities that aren’t
too long-term, complex, costly, or risky. As is explained below, for CEFRIO that means
a greater focus on revenue-generating events and sponsored projects, and for the
Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) it means avoiding the costly, complex, and risky
‘valley of death’.
CEFRIO helps organizations in Quebec use information technologies in order to be more
efficient, productive and innovative. Over the course of its 18 year history, CEFRIO has
transitioned from being a balanced 4th pillar organization to one that operates more
closely to industry, a change that has been partially induced by a reduction in the
proportion of its annual budget that is financed by government. While CEFRIO is
successful in self-financing it finds that this has an impact on the nature of the activities
that it can undertake. The more it must raise funds itself, the more it competes with the
private sector in consulting type activities such as sponsored projects. The more
government funding it receives, the more it can focus on high impact activities in which
the private sector does not participate. In particular, CEFRIO finds it extremely difficult
to connect university researchers to SMEs without government support.
The SRC feels that it can make its greatest contributions when it operates in the costly,
complex, and risky ‘valley of death’. This is the chasm between the relatively low cost
world of scientific discovery and technology development, and the high cost and high
return world of commercial deployment. While the significance and downstream impact
of science- and technology-driven research development is hard to predict, its pursuit can
result in a fairly predictable stream of visible outputs in the form of research publications
and patents. The returns to commercial activity (i.e. dollars) are similarly visible and
well understood and have the benefit of being significant and appropriable by private
investors. But between research and the deployment of new products, services, and
processes is the valley of death where activities such as prototype development and the
pilot testing of large scale processes are complex, costly, and risky and in many cases
yield few results that are measurable or amenable to private returns. As a result both
public and private investors are reluctant to invest in such activities because they share
both the uncertainty of earlier stage research and technology development activities, and
the high cost of downstream commercialization activities.

14

<-----Page 21----->For example, recently the SRC saw the need to upgrade its fermentation plant from
laboratory grade to commercial grade. The laboratory grade plant is currently used by
Saskatchewan firms and university researchers to develop high value, low volume
biological products. The benefit of upgrading the facility to be capable of producing
commercial grade products is that it makes the process of transitioning production from
the laboratory process to the commercial process, as required by valid clinical and field
trials, more seamless and therefore less susceptible to the introduction of errors.
Upgrading the SRC’s facility was an expensive proposition, on the order of $3 million.
Moreover, while local firms declared a strong interest in having the upgraded facility
available, they were unwilling to commit to either sample or production volumes. This
was a high risk, high cost venture of the type that investors are reluctant to fund.
Fortunately in this case the governments of Saskatchewan and Canada both came forward
and the upgrade is underway but this is exactly type of opportunity to create value that is
passed by too often.
The opportunity that awaits
4th pillar organizations of all types represent a vehicle through which the government can
help Canadian firms become more innovative and more successful. Two such
opportunities are described below. With federal government funding the cash-strapped
BC Biotech would be able to more effectively implement its mandate of promoting the
firms in BC’s growing biotechnology industry. For the Canadian Medical Association
(CMA), a federal government program to sponsor 4th pillar organizations would be an
opportunity to demonstrate the ability of its members (some 62,000 physicians) to add
value to the Canadian economy. Physicians represent an important force in Canada’s
system of innovation and the CMA is their national voice. By working together, the
federal government and the CMA could create a powerful force for innovation in the area
of, for example, health informatics.
BC Biotech would do more of the same. The main challenge that BC Biotech faces is
lack of funds. With only $130K in annual government support, BC Biotech must
consume considerable resources to raise sufficient funds to support its international
promotional activities, and it still lacks the resources to do its job properly. As firms in
the biotechnology industry are strongly identified with the region with which they are
associated, this yields an unnecessary reputational handicap for Vancouver biotechnology
firms that are competing internationally for investment capital and licensing deals.
It’s a penalty that is undeserved and unnecessary because in fact, Vancouver is a leading
biotechnology region and Canada is the #2 country in the world with five of the twentyone profitable biotechnology companies worldwide. Vancouver is Canada’s fastest
growing biotechnology cluster, the home of three of Canada’s profitable biotechnology
companies, and the eighth largest biotechnology cluster in North America. These facts
aren’t widely known, in part because the Canadian and Vancouver presence at
international biotechnology conferences is not reflective of the country or the region’s
stature. It’s unfortunate that having investing millions in the scientific and educational

15

<-----Page 22----->programs that are responsible for this success that Canada is not investing in the
promotional activities that would allow us to capitalize on it.
BC Biotech was responsible for the British Columbia pavilion within the Canada pavilion
at one of this year’s major international conferences, Bio 2005 in Philadelphia. To
support its activities, BC Biotech had to raise funds from 28 different organizations, 15
private sector firms in Vancouver and 13 other organizations including PEMD
(International Trade Canada’s Program for Export Market Development), Industry
Canada, Western Economic Diversification, British Columbia, and Vancouver Exchange.
With only five employees BC Biotech cannot devote such significant resources to raising
funds and so its ability to participate as frequently and as substantively as it would like is
compromised. In the near future BC Biotech’s president will present a paper describing
the Vancouver biotechnology cluster at Bio Japan but the organization will be unable to
offer a British Columbia booth within the Canada booth at this event and so aside from
the paper, the Vancouver biotechnology cluster will not be represented.
If BC Biotech had greater support from government it would do more of what it is doing.
As all biotechnology firms, from the fledging to the profitable, have strong connections
with universities, there is no value in BC Biotech diversifying from its promotional
activities into activities designed to facilitate university-industry interaction. Promotional
activities are the weak link in Vancouver’s and Canada’s biotechnology efforts.
The CMA would do something completely different. The CMA endorses the idea of
federal government funding for a program to help 4th pillar organizations support the
competitiveness of Canadian firms. If the government were to launch such a program the
CMA would be a candidate participant and would submit for consideration a program of
its own design that would provide funding and guidance for companies working in the
area of information management and information technology for health care. The CMA
program would work with participating companies to ensure that all necessary
participants are at the table including physicians, technologists, physician office staff,
hospital administrators etc. With $22 billion in assets under management, the CMA is
uniquely positioned to match government funds and company contributions with funds of
its own.
Like their private sector constituents, active and potential 4th pillar organizations in
Canada are numerous and diverse. In many cases they may be the only organization with
which a given small firm engages, and so they represent the best opportunity for
government to reach small firms. But like their small firm constituents, many 4th pillar
organizations face resource shortages, and the more transformative the activities in which
they engage, the more acutely the resource shortages are felt. Activities that are noncustomized, near term, local, and not knowledge intensive (e.g. networking events) can
be undertaken with relatively modest resources. But activities that are one-on-one,
intended to make a difference over the long term, international, or science or technologybased require government support. 4th pillar organizations can sustain their existence
with the former type of activity but their ability to contribute fully to the innovativeness

16

<-----Page 23----->of Canadian firms is linked to their ability to provide high value added assistance of the
type that relies upon the support of government.

17

<-----Page 24----->4.

The Need for Scholarly Attention

I have defined 4th pillar organizations as nonprofit innovation enablers and multipliers.
As such, they might be expected to be of interest both to scholars of the nonprofit or
voluntary sector that study nonprofit organizations, and to innovation scholars,
particularly those that study national systems of innovation. But 4th pillar organizations
represent only about 6% of all nonprofit organizations9 and are qualitatively different
from most other nonprofit organizations. As a result, they are accorded little attention by
nonprofit scholars. They have also thus far been overlooked by innovation scholars who
have given little attention to nonprofit organizations. The following paragraphs provide
evidence for these assertions and suggest that when innovation scholars are equipped
with a clear understanding of the class of 4th pillar organizations, such organizations will
properly appear in the statistics as important contributors to national systems of
innovation.
4th pillar organizations overlooked by nonprofit scholars
Nonprofit scholars are generally concerned with broad issues of social and economic
welfare and seem to regard the pursuit of collective welfare as being orthogonal to the
pursuit of private gains. This is reflected in the classification schemes they devise to
better understand the similarities and differences between different types of nonprofit
organizations. Fundamental to such classification schemes is the difference between
member serving organizations and organizations that serve society at large (Salamon,
1995). This distinction is apparent in Salamon’s 1995 typology of nonprofit
organizations into four classes (Salamon, 1995: Page 54):
•

Member serving organizations such as professional societies, labour unions,
cooperatives, and trade associations that provide goods or services to their members
rather than to society at large.

•

Funding raising intermediaries such as the United Way and private foundations that
exist to raise funds and channel resources rather than to deliver services to members.

•

Public-benefit organizations that exist primarily to serve others in need. Included
here are educational institutions, cultural institutions, social welfare agencies, and
health care organizations.

•

Religious organizations with both member serving and broader goals.

Economists take a very different position on the relationship between public and private
good and regard the two as linked in numerous and complex ways. Generally regarded as
the father of economics, in 1776 Adam Smith described how the pursuit of private gain
leads to greater public good than the direct pursuit of public good:
9

In Section 2 I estimate that of the 161,000 nonprofits in Canada, approximately 10,500 (or approximately
6%) are active and potential 4th pillar organizations that are nonprofits.

18

<-----Page 25----->It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their
humanity, but to their self–love.... Every individual ... [who] ... employs capital ... and ...
labours ... neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is
promoting it ... he is ... led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of
his intention.... By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society.
(Skousan, 2000 citing Adam Smith)
Innovation is a multidimensional activity that often results in both private and public
gains that can be economic, social, or psychological in nature. While there is much we
still don’t know about innovation, what we do know is that the different elements of
innovative activity cannot take place in isolation from one another. Science driven
research contributes to and draws upon advances in technology development.
Technology development draws upon input from customers and potential users, even in
the early stages of new product design (Lane & Maxfield, 1996). And innovative
businesses benefit from relations with university, government and nonprofit researchers
throughout their lifetimes (Statistics Canada, 2003). Innovation necessarily involves
many players from many different types of organizations, and creates both private and
public returns.
The distinction that nonprofit scholars have made between public and private returns has
resulted in their overlooking 4th pillar organizations as a class of nonprofit organizations.
To see 4th pillar organizations as a class of organizations one must be willing to
accommodate the co-mingling of private and public returns, and science-driven,
technology development-driven, and business-driven processes. In the next section I
describe the relationship between the recently developed system for classifying nonprofit
organizations, the International Classification of Nonprofit Organizations, and the system
for classifying 4th pillar organizations presented in Section 2.
The International Classification of Nonprofit Organizations. The International
Classification of Nonprofit Organizations system (ICNPO) was proposed by Salamon and
Anheier in 1992 (Salamon & Anheier, 1992) to facilitate international comparative
studies of nonprofit organizations. The ICNPO system groups nonprofit organizations
into 12 Major Activity Groups as shown in the first column of Table 4, below. While the
ICNPO system makes a big advance on the classification of nonprofit organizations in
general, it remains less than ideal for developing a better understanding of innovationrelated nonprofits.
The major issue is that the ICNPO separates research from commercial activity
notwithstanding the fact that scientific and technological innovation necessarily combines
the two activities. The ICNPO system classifies research related nonprofits under
Subgroup 2.4 – Research, and business related nonprofits under Major Activity Group 11
– Business and professional associations and unions. As shown in the third column of
Table 4, Subgroup 2.4 is associated with five of the 10 different types of active and

19

<-----Page 26----->potential nonprofit 4th pillar organizations identified in Section 210, and Major Activity
Group 11 is associated with four types of potential 4th pillar organizations. Major
Activity Group 8 – Philanthropic intermediaries and voluntarism promotion is associated
with one type of potential 4th pillar organization, namely Medical and other foundations.
Given that nonprofit scholars have only recently devised a general classification system
for nonprofit organizations it is understandable that they have not yet concerned
themselves with innovation-related nonprofits. Fortunately, as shown in Table 4, it is
possible to create a mapping that connects the general purpose ICNPO classification
system to the 4th pillar classification system proposed in Section 2.

20

<-----Page 27----->4th pillar organizations not yet recognized by models of innovation
Working in a relatively new area of investigation, innovation researchers have focused on
three levels of analysis: the level of the firm and interfirm relations, the level of the
region and regional systems of innovation, and the level of the nation and national
systems of innovation (NSI). As the broadest level of analysis, the NSI school is the
most likely to have considered the role of nonprofit organizations. But a review of the
NSI literature shows that most researchers limit their investigations to descriptive reports
of specific nonprofit organizations without developing a more abstract view of their role
and activities (Edquist, 1997; Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993; Niosi, 2000).
The triple helix model of university-industry-government relations (Etzkowitz &
Leydesdorff, 2000) merits special attention. It is an influential model the purpose of
which is to describe the dynamics of innovation within national systems of innovation.
Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff suggest that under a laissez-faire model of university-industrygovernment relations, the three sectors operate separately from one another, with “strong
borders dividing them and highly circumscribed relations among the spheres” (Page 111).
This is depicted on the left in Figure 2, below. In contrast, in the triple helix model, the
three sectors are shown to overlap one another “generating a knowledge infrastructure in
terms of overlapping institutional spheres, with each taking the role of the other and with
hybrid organizations emerging at the interfaces” (Page 111). This is depicted in the
centre of Figure 2.
The 4th pillar model builds upon the triple helix model by legitimizing the important role
of the nonprofit hybrid organizations that have emerged in national systems of
innovation. It departs from the triple helix model insofar as it does not accept the
declaration that the formerly separate spheres of university, industry, and government
activity are now overlapping. According to the 4th pillar model, university, industry, and
government organizations continue to operate according to their own logics and are able
to engage in a substantive and sustained manner with one another through the bridging
contributions of 4th pillar organizations. The 4th pillar model is depicted on the right in
Figure 2.

21

<-----Page 28----->Figure 2: A comparison of innovation models
4th pillar organizations marginalized by measurement tools
The Frascati Manual guides the analysis of innovation and R&D throughout the countries
of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). It identifies
four sectors of the economy: the business enterprise sector, the government sector, the
private nonprofit sector, and the higher education sector. 4th pillar organizations are not
necessarily classified in the nonprofit sector as might be expected, because nonprofit
organizations are excluded from the nonprofit sector if:
1. They mainly render services to enterprises, in which case they are classified under
the business enterprise sector (this may include Types 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10 of 4th
pillar organizations).
2. They primarily serve government, or if they are entirely or mainly financed and
controlled by government, in which case they are classified under the government
sector (this may include 4th pillar organizations of Type 4).
3. They offer higher education services or are controlled by institutes of higher
education which includes “all research institutes, experimental stations, and
clinics operating under the direct control of or administered by or associated with
higher education establishments” (this may include Types 3 and 8 4th pillar
organizations and possibly Type 1 as well).
This would leaves primarily medical and other foundations (Type 9) and possibly the
balanced 4th pillar organizations (Type 1) classified under the nonprofit sector (OECD,
1994).
Statistics Canada uses the Frascati Manual to report on Gross Domestic Expenditures on
Research and Development (GERD) by funding sector. It reports that in 2002, the
nonprofit sector spent $624 million on R&D in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2005b). This
figure is roughly comparable to the likely total spending on R&D of the medical and
22

<-----Page 29----->other foundations type of 4th pillar organizations as I explain in the following. Recall that
in Section 2 it was estimated that there are approximately 1,500 medical and other
foundations in Canada (10% of the total of 15,935 grant-making, fundraising, and
voluntarism promotion organizations). If these 1,500 organizations account for 10% of
the total 2003 revenues of the 15,935 grant-making, fundraising, and voluntarism
promotion organizations, i.e. for 10% of $8,253 million (Statistics Canada, 2005a), then
in 2003 they had revenues of approximately $825 million. If these organizations spent
80% of their revenues on R&D (and the remainder on other activities), then they likely
funded approximately $660 million of R&D in 2003 ($660 million = $8,253 million *
80%), which is 6% more than the 2002 figure of $624 million cited by the Statistics
Canada GERD report. This suggests that the only 4th pillar organizations that appear as
nonprofits in Canada’s GERD statistics are medical and other foundations.
In this section I have suggested that part of the explanation for why 4th pillar
organizations are not well understood is that they have been overlooked by both nonprofit
scholars and by innovation scholars. As the following quotation from Salamon &
Anheier illustrates, it was only recently that nonprofit scholars have begun to address the
conceptual difficulties surrounding nonprofit organizations in general. The stage is now
set for an improved understanding of 4th pillar organizations.
“The lack of attention that has historically been given to the nonprofit sector around the
world has been due to factors that are as much conceptual as empirical. The nonprofit
sector is poorly understood, in other words, not so much because the data on it are so
limited as because the concepts used to depict its boundaries are so murky and
imprecise.” (Salamon & Anheier, 1992).

Recommendations for Government Action

1.

Provide consolidated and sustained federal government support for active 4th
pillar organizations. Create an agency or foundation to integrate funding for
active 4th pillar organizations and implement a national, competitive, peerreviewed process to provide funding on the basis of excellence and fit with
national or regional priorities.

At present, 4th pillar organizations receive federal government funding from a variety of
sources including Industry Canada, the National Research Council, the Natural Sciences
and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Technology Partnerships Canada, Canada
Economic Development for Quebec Regions, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency,
Western Economic Diversification, Natural Resources Canada, the Canadian Foundation
for Innovation, and the Program for Export Market Development of the Department of
Foreign Affairs and International Trade. By consolidating funding under a single
organization the government will replace multiple sporadic and sometimes arbitrary
funding decisions with a more rational process that engenders excellence among the
organizations competing for funding on a national basis.
Such an approach would assure funding for the population of 4th pillar organizations but
not for individual members of the population. This is analogous to the way in which the
establishment of NSERC created a sustained source of funding for the population of
university researchers without assuring ongoing funding for any individual member of
the population. It is similarly not expected that all projects put forward by active 4th
pillar organizations would receive funding. As in the past, 4th pillar organizations that are
unsuccessful in attracting funding will either merge with other 4th pillar organizations
(e.g. the Strategic Microelectronics Council was recently merged with the Information
Technology Association of Canada) or fold. Where the government sees fit to target
funding, as it sometimes does in the granting councils, objectives or programs that are
focused on particular regions, industries, or technologies can be identified. Criteria for
funding would then cover a number of measures of excellence and relevance such as the
following:
1.

The project has the support and the participation of all necessary players: firms,
universities, government, and other nonprofit organizations.

2.

The team has the expertise necessary to successfully perform the work.

3.

The lead organization has a good performance record (the performance record
might be based on past projects once the program has a history and expertise in
assessing performance).

4.

The proposed project targets key industries such as those that are facing severe
restructuring problems, those that are large in terms of contributions to GDP or
employment, or those that have high growth potential.

24

<-----Page 31----->5.

The proposed project targets key regions such as challenged regions or regions
with high-potential growth clusters.

6.

The proposed projected address key challenges such as the ‘valley of death’
between discovery-based research and commercial product development or the
adoption of advanced technologies and business practices by small and medium
sized enterprises.

Magnitude of funding
The following provides a very rough estimate of the appropriate level of federal
government support for active 4th pillar organizations.
In this report approximately 40 active 4th pillar organizations have been identified and the
total number of active 4th pillar organizations is estimated to be 100. The total annual
funding that these organizations receive from the federal government is estimated to be
on the order of $300 million11. As the first proposed government action is for
consolidated funding, and as the majority of funding for active 4th pillar organizations is
already in place, initial consolidated funding levels can be modest (say $50 million per
year) and over a period of three years can increase to $300 million per year. If funding is
granted on a competitive basis, not all active 4th pillar organizations will necessarily
receive funding.
2.

Provide consolidated funding for potential 4th pillar organizations to involve
them as full participants in Canada’s national system of innovation.

Consolidated funding for potential 4th pillar organizations to participate fully in Canada’s
national system of innovation. Potential 4th pillar organizations such as industry
associations and economic development organizations currently receive relatively modest
levels of support from the federal government. In this report, the total number of industry
associations and economic development organizations was estimated to be approximately
5,750 and it is estimated that they currently receive approximately $150 million in federal
government funding per year (an average of approximately $25,000 per organization per
year). This support comes from a variety of sources including the regional economic
development agencies and other agencies that are part of the Industry Canada portfolio,
and various other government departments.
3.

Provide increased funding for 4th all pillar organizations.

Increased funding for all 4th pillar organizations will allow them to increase the
efficiency, effectiveness, and scale of their operations as in the case of BC Biotech, or to
take on new activities for the benefit of Canada as in the case of the Canadian Medical
11

I assume that the 40 most visible active 4th pillar organizations (those that are listed in Appendix A)
receive an average of $5 million per year from the federal government for a total of $200 million in annual
funding. The remaining 60 active 4th pillar organizations are assumed to receive a total of $100 million in
annual funding. These estimates are crude at best.

25

<-----Page 32----->Association. A national competition for funding among these organizations will increase
their legitimacy and engender the pursuit of excellence. Increased funding of $50 million
in Year 2 and $100 million in Year 3 is recommended.
Magnitude of funding for active and potential 4th pillar organizations combined
Figure 3 below shows the recommended total funding levels for 4th pillar organizations
over the three year period 2006-2007 to 2008-2009. When fully ramped up the program
would cost on the order of $550 million per year with $100 million of this being new
funding and the remainder is the result of consolidating existing distributions. To
engender innovation and competition it will be preferable to combine funding for active
and potential 4th pillar organizations into a single pool of funds. The fund could serve a
variety of targeted programs that emphasize different priorities such as collaboration with
university researchers, regional disparities, or industries where needs or opportunities are
high.

Investigate the possibility of spinning-off certain government institutions into
nonprofit organizations.

Over the longer term the federal government may wish to consider making greater use of
nonprofit organizations as a means by which to contribute to innovation and economic
development in Canada. Other countries such as Taiwan and Germany make extensive
use of nonprofit organizations to conduct research and technology development that
involves industry and universities in addition to government. In 2003, the government of
Taiwan spun off two government research centres (the National Synchrotron Radiation
Research Centre or NSRRC and the National Applied Research Laboratories or NARL)
into nonprofit organizations. The goal in doing so was to “enhance flexibility and
service” and the newly constituted nonprofit organizations continue to receive significant

26

<-----Page 33----->government support through the National Science Council (Taiwan Times, 2004).
Taiwan’s answer to Canada’s National Research Council, the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) also operates as a nonprofit institution as do the Fraunhofer
Institutes in Germany. See (Dalziel, 2004) for statement on the projected benefits of
reconstituting the research institutes of Canada’s National Research Council as nonprofit
organizations.
The preceding recommendations are put forward on the basis of the benefits for Canada
that they are expected to yield. At the same time enacting the recommendations entails
several risks. Both the benefits and the risks of recommendations 1 through 3 are
presented below.
Benefits
1.

Leveraging the knowledge and capabilities of Canadians. The primary benefit
of working through 4th pillar organizations is that is it leverages the knowledge
and capabilities of Canadians. It distributes the problem of how to make
Canadian firms more innovative and productive across groups of business people
and academics that can design targeted programs that address important needs and
opportunities. A comprehensive federal program will spur the development of
many worthwhile initiatives. Those that don’t receive federal government
funding may be able to proceed in reduced form without funding or with
alternative funding.

2.

Legitimacy for 4th pillar organizations. Create legitimacy and visibility for the
class of 4th pillar organizations. This will lead to a number of second order
benefits such as an improved ability on the part of 4th pillar organizations to
attract, retain, and develop the careers of employees.

3.

Increased resources for excellent 4th pillar organizations. Make available
more resources available to excellent 4th pillar organizations that are addressing
priority needs and thereby to key industries, regions, and firms.

4.

Merit-based funding decisions for excellence. The federal government can use
merit-based competition for funding as a lever to motivate 4th pillar organizations
to excel. Success in a merit-based competition will signal excellence which will
have multiple second order benefits such as the identification of best practices
among 4th pillar organizations.

5.

Merit-based funding decisions for transparency. Centralizing and
rationalizing the funding process allows the government to achieve greater
transparency and removes the political element from funding decisions. It will be
essential to retain the knowledge of departments by involving government
representatives with domain specific knowledge in the peer-reviewed funding
process.

27

<-----Page 34----->6.

Better and more efficient funding decisions. Make better funding decisions by
centralizing the function and by drawing upon the knowledge of external peer
evaluators. Make more efficient funding decisions through the elimination of
duplicated effort that is the result of having multiple departments involved in the
process.

7.

Volunteer participation. Leverage the effort of volunteers, both in the 4th pillar
organizations themselves and in the peer-reviewed evaluation process.

8.

Create an innovation culture. By visibly supporting nonprofit organizations
whose mandates centre on innovation and productivity, the government sends a
strong, yet gently delivered, signal to Canadians regarding the value of innovation
in the broadest sense.

9.

Learning. Centralizing the funding process creates an opportunity to study it and
learn from successful and unsuccessful experiences.

10.

Make government a partner. By giving visibility and support to a broad range
of geographically distributed organizations the federal government makes itself a
partner to the hundreds of thousands of people that are employed by 4th pillar
organizations, and to the millions of people employed by the firms that are
supported by 4th pillar organizations.

Risks
1.

The major risks to government are those commonly associated with
interventionism. By centralizing and thereby increasing the visibility of its
funding for 4th pillar organizations, the federal government risks attracting
criticism for overspending, spending on industry subsidies, and spending on
organizations viewed by some as unnecessary to the conduct of business. These
risks are minimal as this report recommends new funding of only $50 million,
with a three year ramp up. The risk of criticism can be further mitigated by
ensuring that the criteria for funding are appropriate and sufficiently challenging
as to ensure that only the most important and best-managed organizations are
funded. In any given funding round only about 30-50% of applicants should be
successful.

2.

A 30-50% success rate will create another challenge as there will necessarily be a
number of organizations that are unsuccessful in attracting funding in a given
year. This problem can be alleviated by giving the unsuccessful organizations
high-quality feedback that will increase their chances of success in the following
year’s competition.

3.

There is the possibility that a centralized approach to funding 4th pillar
organizations will diminish connections between 4th pillar organizations and the
departments and agencies through which they formerly received funding. This is

28

<-----Page 35----->not regarded as a serious risk because where those ties are intrinsically valuable to
both parties they will likely be maintained.
4.

It is natural for investors to be reluctant to invest in activities where returns are
low, risky, or diffuse and a fund for 4th pillar organizations in Canada may be
inclined to support near-term highly visible projects and programs at the expense
of long-term, risky projects with less visible results. The use of targeted programs
and expert evaluators will alleviate this tendency.

29

<-----Page 36----->6.

Conclusion

In this report I have defined 4th pillar organizations as innovation enablers and multipliers
that work to promote, support, or conduct science, technology, or business-practice based
innovation that results in new products, services, or processes deployed by companies.
Active 4th pillar organizations that are industry-led, supported by government, and that
engage with university researchers, are distinguished from potential 4th pillar
organizations which do not engage with all three of the other pillars of innovation as
described, or which are not structured as nonprofit organizations. The total size of the
population of active and potential 4th pillar organizations in Canada is estimated to be
some 10,700 organizations.
4th pillar organizations are a means by which the Canadian government can promote the
innovativeness and productivity of a broad range of geographically distributed
companies. There are fundamentally four ways in which a company can improve its
productivity:
1.

Sell the same products and services at lower cost – this is the increased efficiency
approach

2.

Sell more highly valued products and services at the same cost – this involves an
improved understanding of and an ability to deliver what customers value

3.

Sell products and services of slightly reduced value at greatly reduced cost – this
is efficiency under conditions of industry consolidation or reduced demand for the
firm’s products, perhaps as the result of a superior product offered by a
competitor

4.

Sell products and services of greatly increased value at slightly increased cost –
this involves being able to deliver products to customer that are so significantly
superior that customers are willing to pay more for them.

It is important to recognize that only two of these approaches to increased productivity
necessarily involve greater efficiency (Approaches 1 and 3). Approaches 2 and 4 are
more directly related to greater effectiveness in understanding what customers want and
the ability to deliver it to them.
4th pillar organizations help companies improve their innovativeness and productivity
consistent with all four of the approaches just described. For example, the Excellence in
Manufacturing Consortium in Ontario helps companies reduce costs through customized
learning initiatives, while BC Biotech helps increase the revenues of Vancouver
biotechnology firms through its promotional activities. Peter Nicholson, Senior Special
Advisor to the Prime Minister, makes the link between the needs of small and medium
sized enterprises and the ability of nonprofit organizations to assist them in the adoption
of best practices and technology, citing the success of the Ag Rep system in bringing
about vast improvements in the productivity of small farmers in the 20th century

30

<-----Page 37----->(Nicholson, 2003). What Ag Rep did for the farmers in the 20th century, BC Biotech can
do for fledging Vancouver biotechnology firms in the 21st century.
4th pillar organizations are a means by which the Canadian government can promote the
innovativeness and productivity of a broad range of geographically distributed
companies. In particular, 4th pillar organizations are well equipped to help small and
medium sized firms adopt advanced technologies and business practices. No amount of
reduced taxes or tax credits can help an organization that is unsure of what it should do or
one that has insufficient resources to meaningfully invest in prototype development or
global marketing. 4th pillar organizations are distinguished from monetary incentives by
the fact that they are composed of knowledgeable people who work with firms to
motivate them to adapt and innovate and give them the tools to do so. They are the
government’s best channel to the small and medium sized firms upon which our nation’s
prosperity depends.
This report has several limitations in scope that should be remedied to provide a solid
basis for action. Most importantly, a survey of a sample of active and potential 4th pillar
organizations should be conducted to better characterize their current work, resources,
and challenges, and to solicit their input on the design of government interventions. The
government may also wish to determine more accurately the size of its current
distributions to nonprofits, and to conduct a structured investigation of the use of 4th pillar
organizations in other countries.

(416) 620-4220
President
Gerry Fedchun
gfedchun@apma.ca
Mission
To promote the manufacture in Canada of automotive parts, systems, components, materials,
tools, equipment and supplies; the provision of services used in the original equipment
automotive industry; and to engage in activities in support of the welfare of the associations’
members.
Type of organization: Non-profit
Geographic jurisdiction: Canada wide
Founded: 1952
Description
APMA is Canada's national association representing OEM producers of parts, equipment, tools,
supplies and services for the worldwide automotive industry. APMA has over 400 members
which account for 90% percent of independent parts production in Canada. All but one of its
members are located in Ontario or Quebec. APMA has 7 staff members and annual revenues of
$2.5 million.
Activities
APMA's fundamental objective is to promote the automotive parts manufacturing industry both
domestically and internationally. The Association provides important representation to both the
federal and provincial governments and creates and executes global marketing initiatives in order
to develop international trade and business opportunities for the membership. APMA members
participate in trade missions to Asia, Europe, Mexico, and North America, and attend
conferences, regional meetings and specific issue workshops and seminars. APMA has working
agreements with its counterparts in Brazil, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United States.
These agreements have been formed to promote an exchange of market information and to create
strategic alliances to strengthen the global automotive industry. APMA members are actively
involved in the Association's affairs through the following committees:
• Nominating Committee
• Human Resources Development Committee
• Environment Committee
• Marketing & Strategic Initiatives Committee
• Innovation & Technology Committee
• Annual Conference Committee
Expertise
APMA’s expertise includes knowledge of the automotive industry, marketing, and environmental
regulations and practices.
Stakeholders
Automobile manufacturers across Canada and automotive component suppliers (over 400).
Canadian citizens

61

<-----Page 54----->Sources of funding
Seventy-five percent of APMA’s operations funding is from membership fees and 25% from
events. In addition to its operational funding, the APMA’s trade missions receive funding from
PEMD (the federal government’s Program for Export Market Development) and it occasionally
undertakes other externally funded projects.
Volunteer contributions
Total volunteer contributions are $824K or 1/3 of the APMA budget. This is the sum of $324K
worth of volunteer time contributed by the APMA’s 18 member board of directors, comprised of
leading automotive executives, and $500K worth of volunteer time contributed by the over 100
individuals that serve on the APMA’s seven committees.
Impact
The APMA published several reports during 2004 including a policy paper entitled “Strategic
Vision for the Canadian Automotive Original Equipment Supply Industry”. APMA has been an
active participant in lobbying governments in Canada and the United States to keep the
border secure but open to legitimate and low risk trade. After extensive lobbying by APMA and
others, the federal and Ontario governments each announced $500 million investment funds to
promote assembly plant investment. APMA made a total of 29 presentations to government to
put forward the industry position on government policies, legislation, and priorities. APMA
maintained an active program to promote trade and the Canadian automotive manufacturing
supply industry globally by participating and coordinating various initiatives throughout the year.
Organizational changes
None.
Changes in mission
In 1997 the priorities were 1) expanding the customer base and 2) the development of skilled
tradespeople. Now, innovation is the #1 long term priority and the #1 short term priority is the
Canada-US border. The OEMs and the Tier 1 suppliers want the parts suppliers to be more
innovative as they recognize that their future depends on the innovativeness of their entire value
chain.
What difficulties does your organization encounter in its efforts to promote the ability of
firms to develop and deploy new products, services, or processes?
1. Getting through to small companies. Small companies don’t have the spare talent to go to
meetings. They operate in a very lean fashion.
2. When existing members consolidate, the membership fees that the APMA receives are
reduced.
What could your organization do with to promote the ability of firms to develop and deploy
new products, services, or processes if it had a new three-year project funded at 30% of
your annual budget?
With federal government support the APMA would establish a group that would liaise between
the automotive parts suppliers and university researchers. This would entail a detailed needs
assessment of the parts suppliers and a capabilities assessment of the university researchers.
Once needs-capabilities teams were established, their collaborative projects could receive seed
funding from the APMA university liaison initiative. This undertaking would build on the work
of the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council (CAPC), a group that includes representatives
from the automotive OEMs, parts suppliers, dealers, after market suppliers, the Canadian
Autoworkers Union, academic researchers, and federal and provincial governments, and that
looks for ways to improve the competitiveness of the Canadian automotive industry. In
particular, it would build on the work of the Innovation Committee of the CAPC, which has
tasked the APMA with the creation of a web portal to facilitate communication between
automotive parts suppliers.

Mission
To help organizations use information technologies in order to be more efficient, productive and
innovative. CEFRIO conducts, in partnership with government industry and the private sector,
research and strategic monitoring projects devoted to the adoption of the information
technologies.
Type of organization: Non-profit
Geographic jurisdiction: Province of Québec
Founded: 1987
Description
CEFRIO has adopted a strongly multidisciplinary, multi-sectorial approach to innovation. Its
activities draw on several social sciences (management, education, sociology, and economics),
health care, and engineering, and its work routinely involves private firms, non-profit
organizations, government, and university researchers. Its membership reflects this diversity with
approximately 80 private sector organizations (firms, industry associations, and professional
societies), 50 federal, provincial, and municipal government organizations, and 23 universities
(all the universities in Quebec).
CEFRIO distinguishes itself among 4th pillar organizations for its strong connection with social
science researchers. It is committed to technology adoption and regards this as a social process
that must be informed by an understanding of how individuals and organizations learn and adapt.
Its website quotes Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as saying: “to
reap the benefits of each dollar invested in the acquisition of technology, businesses and public
organizations must allocate $9 to the development of their organizational and human capital”.
CEFRIO has approximately 30 employees and an annual budget of between $3 and $4 million.
Activities
CEFRIO conducts research and strategic monitoring projects devoted to the adoption of the
information technologies. The projects cover all sectors of Québec’s private and public economy.
CEFRIO focuses on social and organizational innovation in sectors of strategic importance to
Québec (education, health and public administration) and on the themes of corporate
competitiveness, knowledge management and the internet. CEFRIO has established collaboration
links with six prestigious international centres in France, Belguim, and the US, and it offers
activities ranging from personalized knowledge transfer sessions to an international symposium.
Expertise
CEFRIO’s 30 employees include social scientists and statisticians with knowledge of the issues
surrounding technology and diffusion.
Stakeholders
CEFRIO’s membership includes approximately 80 private sector organizations (firms, industry
associations, and professional societies), 50 federal, provincial, and municipal government
organizations, and 23 universities (all the universities in Quebec).

65

<-----Page 58----->Sources of funding
CEFRIO raises about 60-70% of its budget through its membership fees, survey and research
activities, events. At one time CEFRIO received $1.5 million/year from the Quebec government
but now it receives only $1.2 million or about 30% of its budget. While it is successful in selffinancing it finds that this has an impact on the nature of the activities that it can undertake. The
more it must raise funds itself, the more it competes with the private sector in consulting type
activities. The more government funding it receives, the more it can focus on high impact
activities in which the private sector does not participate. In particular CEFRIO finds it
extremely difficult to connect university researchers to SMEs without government support.
Volunteer contributions
An estimate of the annual value of volunteer contributions is not available but all of the
committees and projects draw upon substantial volunteer contributions. By way of illustration the
18-member board of directors contributes its time on an entirely volunteer basis and its
contribution is conservatively estimated at $366K.
Impact
During its first 17 years CEFRIO maintained greater than 90% member renewal each year and
25,000 knowledge transfer activities. It has achieved an 86% satisfaction rate with events and
knowledge transfer activities, 500,000 visits to website per year with 450,000 consultations of
online documents each year. CEFRIO also measures the extent and effects of learning associated
with each project.
Organizational changes
At present CEFRIO’s board has extremely strong private sector representation with provincial
and federal government representatives serving as observers. This reflects a shift in CEFRIO’s
orientation away from public financing and knowledge flows and towards the private sector. Part
of the reason for the shift is the fact that the federal government abandoned its Department of
Communications and this has made it more difficult for CEFRIO to coordinate its relations with
the federal and provincial governments.
Changes in mission
None aside from a shift to encompass the internet.
What difficulties does your organization encounter in its efforts to promote the ability of
firms to develop and deploy new products, services, or processes?
1. CEFRIO could achieve greater impact if the knowledge transfer agents with which it engages
had greater credibility within their respective organizations. In many cases the individuals that
CEFRIO deals with are information technology or human resource specialists within their
respective organizations. These people often lack sufficient credibility to effect organizational
change whereas when CEFRIO deals with more senior individuals, it finds that technology
adoption proceeds more easily. The problem can be especially acute in small firms owing to their
limited resources. Sometimes large firms can afford to have several individuals engage with
CEFRIO simultaneously and this reduces the barriers to technology adoption.
CEFRIO addresses this challenge by engaging in leader-driven projects that have the support of
senior management whenever possible. It makes sure that it listens effectively and that it designs
its interventions to maximize the likelihood of their adoption. Also, it works multilaterally,
engaging individuals and organizations in their respective peer groups. This lends credibility to
the projects that it undertakes and provides the projects with the support of a network.
2. The second difficulty that CEFRIO faces is the lack of government support for the social and
human sciences. The government tries to promote industrial competitiveness by supporting
engineering research and technology development and it invariably talks about the importance of
knowledge transfer. The problem is that it allocates very little money to supporting the social

66

<-----Page 59----->dimension of knowledge transfer, notwithstanding the fact that it is well known that knowledge
transfer is time consuming, disruptive, risky, and costly. This problem occurs at two levels: first
the government provides insufficient support for research on knowledge transfer and second it
provides insufficient support for the practice of knowledge transfer. Of all the knowledge
transfer organizations in Quebec, CEFRIO is most closely linked to the human and social
sciences and most weakly supported by government.

Mission
To serve and unite the physicians of Canada and be the national advocate, in partnership with the
people of Canada, for the highest standards of health and health care.
Type of organization: Non-profit
Geographic jurisdiction: Canada wide
Founded: 1867, incorporated in 1969
Description
The CMA represents some 62,000 physicians, 75% of the physicians in Canada.
CMA has approximately 150 employees in Ottawa, not including CMA Holdings employees.
CMA Holdings, established in 1969, oversees the MD Financial Group, the Physician Services
Group, and the Normandy Group.
In 2004, the CMA incurred $31 million in expenses, not including CMA Holdings
Activities
The central part of CMA conducts research on health policy, disseminates information, and
supports the policy development process and national advocacy initiatives. In 2004 the CMA
produced two important documents, Taming of the Queue, on wait times and Better Access,
Better Health, released days before the historic first minister’s conference on health care in
September. The five core councils and committees of the CMA are the:
•
Council on Education and Workforce
•
Council on Health Care and Promotion
•
Council on Health Policy and Economics
•
Committee on Ethics
•
Political Action Committee.
Within the MD Financial Group:
•
12 financial services including investment, insurance, estate planning, etc.
Within the Physician Services Group:
•
Practice Solutions that helps physicians with the business side of medicine
•
GlobalMedic that handles internet services (used by 39,000 physicians in Canada)
•
HealthCare Software (CMAH acquired a majority share of HealthCare Software in
Cambridge ON in 2004)
•
CMA Media (previously the publications division of CMA).
Within the Normandy Group:
•
For profit financial services.

<-----Page 60----->Expertise
Policy analysts, economists. Financial specialists within the MD Financial Group and the
Normandy Group. Information technology and business specialists within the Physician Services
Group.
Stakeholders
Physicians across Canada (62,000), 75% of Canadian physicians, 85-90% if Quebec is excluded.
Canadian citizens
Sources of funding
Total 2004 revenues: $36 million of which
Membership fees: $12 million
Publications: $8.5 million
Leasing of owned building: approximately $5 million
Dividends from subsidiaries and interest: $3.5 million
Other: $7 million (in 2004 includes $4 million for transfer of CMA publication directorate to
CMA Holdings)
No government funding
Volunteer contributions
2000 meeting days and 2000 preparation days contributed by physicians per year with a partial
reimbursement of $1000 per meeting day. Total physician volunteer contribution estimated at $2
million. An additional 460 entirely volunteer days contributed by 460 days spent by accreditors
of the CMA’s conjoint accreditation program for a contribution of roughly $500K. Total
volunteer contribution estimated at $2.5 million.
Impact
CMA considers the strong participation of physicians as members as an indication of its
effectiveness. Another indication is the fact that a survey found the CMA to be among the most
influential and credible non-profits on Parliament Hill.
Organizational changes
CMA Holdings, launched in 1969, now has $22 billion in assets under management.
The Physician Services Group was created in 2004 to regroup all the non-financial services
initiatives within CMA Holdings.
Changes in mission
CMA’s central mission has not changed in the 138 years since its founding.
What difficulties does your organization encounter in its efforts to promote the ability of
firms to develop and deploy new products, services, or processes?
In general, the CMA does not currently work to promote the competitiveness of firms.
Notwithstanding this it has undertaken to promote the adoption, by physicians, of the products of
HealthCare Software, a software firm in which it is the majority shareholder.
What could your organization do with to promote the ability of firms to develop and deploy
new products, services, or processes if it had a new three-year project funded at 30% of
your annual budget?
The CMA endorses the idea of federal government funding for a program to help 4th pillar
organizations support the competitiveness of Canadian firms. If the government were to launch
such a program the CMA would be a candidate participant and would submit for consideration a
program of its own design that would provide funding and guidance for companies working in the
area of information management and information technology for health care. The CMA program
would work with participating companies to ensure that all necessary participants are at the table
including physicians, technologists, physician office staff, hospital administrators etc. With $22
billion in assets under management, the CMA is uniquely positioned to match government funds
and company contributions with funds of its own. The CMA considers $10 million (in federal
funding) per 4th pillar organization a minimal average funding level for such a program.

Mission
Members sharing to optimize learning, expertise and resources, to achieve world-class.
Type of organization: Non-profit
Geographic jurisdiction: Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia
Incorporated in 1997.
Description
EMC works in 175 communities in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It divides these
communities into 37 groups (consortia) and each of its field service advisors are responsible for
one or more geographic groups (consortia). EMC has 550 member firms, most between 25 and
300 employees in size (the largest member has 12,000 employees). Its members represent all
areas of manufacturing including automotive, pulp & paper, packaging, food processing,
aerospace, and electronics. EMC has one office in Owen Sound, Ontario. It employs 12
employees and 10 field service advisors on contract. It uses the services of some 25-30 training
firms on an as-needed basis. The annual budget is estimated to be $600K.
Activities
EMC has three main programs: Strategic Interest Groups, The Learning Centre, and Member
Needs Help.
Strategic Interest Groups (SIGs). Field Services Advisors (FSAs) are assigned to one or more
geographic regions/consortia and manage all the SIGs associated with that region(s). In most
areas there will be a senior manager’s SIG and a human resources SIG and there may be other
SIGs dealing with topics such as quality and production, environment, information technology, or
health and safety. EMC member organizations support the activities of the SIG by attending
meetings, by sending in requested information for surveys, and by putting forward topics of
interest. The FSA supports the SIG by vetting topics to make sure there is reasonably broad
appeal, by designing questionnaires to solicit facts and perspectives from member firms, by
identifying needed subject matter experts, and by designing a program to promote the
implementation of solutions.
The Learning Centre. The second area in which contributes is training. Training needs are
identified by individual EMC member firms or during SIG meetings. These needs are vetted
amongst relevant EMC members to ensure that the need is shared by a sufficiently large number
of firms. EMC then puts together the plans for the training, recruits a training firm to offer the
services, and identifies a location in the minority of cases where a EMC member firm has not
already offered to host it.
Member Needs Help. EMC’s newest offering responds to member’s queries as they arise.
Upon receipt of a query EMC either finds the answer in its database of already answered
questions or it solicits a response from its member community. Solicitations for responses

69

<-----Page 62----->(unanswered questions) and responses are published every Tuesday in an electronic newsletter.
(The general EMC newsletter is sent to 15,000 individuals every Thursday. EMC has up to 2030 contacts with each member firm.)
Expertise
Employees and especially the field service advisors have strong knowledge and experience in
manufacturing.
Stakeholders
550+ manufacturing firms in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
Sources of funding
Operational expenses are financed by member fees of $1200/year for Ontario companies and
$1000/year for companies in Atlantic Canada. Occasionally projects and programs receive
additional municipal or provincial government support.
Impact
EMC estimated the impact of its offerings in Ontario during the 1997-2002 time period, prior to
commencing operations in Atlantic Canada. Through a combination of attracting new business to
the province and increasing the efficiency of existing businesses, EMC’s impact was estimated to
be $175 million.
Organizational changes
EMC has its routes in an industry-driven, Ontario-government facilitated manufacturing network
in the Owen Sound area that was initiated in the mid 1980s. When the government stopped
funding the program, the companies involved continued to support the network and Al Diggins,
formerly the government facilitator, became the president and general manager of EMC.
Changes in mission
None aside from geographic expansion.
What difficulties does your organization encounter in its efforts to promote the ability of
firms to develop and deploy new products, services, or processes?
The are two bottlenecks to success in the SIGs, the first involves the commitment of time on the
part of member or potential member firms and the second involves building the community to
create the SIG. New or small manufacturing firms may be struggling with many challenges and
may be reluctant to invest their time and energies in external processes when it’s unclear to them
whether or not the external processes will be helpful. EMC faces the challenge of persuading
such firms that the likely benefits of membership will be greater than the certain investment of
time and energy that’s required.
Second, it is difficult for EMC to create a new consortium, particularly in a region that is not
already strongly connected through an existing institution such as an economic development
office or a chamber of commerce. EMC must identify the suitable firms and build linkages
between them, and must identify someone to serve as the field service advisor (FSA). This
second task can be extremely difficult as the individual must have considerable manufacturing
knowledge and experience (about 20 years), coupled with the ability to deal well with multiple
different stakeholders. Moreover, the person must be willing to work for a moderate salary,
usually in a fairly remote setting with few other resources. Because of the difficulty of finding a
suitable FSA, EMC usually ‘seeds’ a new consortium with an experienced FSA, bringing in the
new individual once the consortium is established and the right individual is found. This problem
limits EMC’s ability to grow because it is reluctant to spread its experienced FSAs over old and
new territories and thereby compromise its ability to serve existing members in the interest of
serving new members. EMC currently has five communities in Ontario that are ‘screaming’ for
its services.

Mission
SRC's mission is to help the people of Saskatchewan strengthen the economy with quality jobs
and a secure environment. SRC does this through research, development, and the transfer of
innovative scientific and technological solutions, applications and services.
Geographic jurisdiction: Saskatchewan
Founded: 1947
Description
SRC is Saskatchewan's leading provider of applied R&D and technology commercialization. The
council takes the leading-edge knowledge developed in Saskatchewan and sells it to the world
and, at the same time, brings the best knowledge the work has to offer and applies it to the unique
Saskatchewan situations. The SRC has more than 265 employees.
Activities
The SRC undertakes R&D in five of the economic sectors that have been identified as strategic to
the province of Saskatchewan: agriculture and biotechnology, environment, mining and minerals,
energy, and manufacturing and value-added processing.
Expertise
Scientists, engineers, and technologists in a variety of disciplines. Eighteen of the staff are adjust
professors in Saskatchewan universities. The particular strength of the SRC is pilot scale process
development, and technology and prototype development.
Stakeholders
Roughly 80% of the SRCs clients are large organizations from the public and private sector.
Twenty five clients are responsible for 75-80% of the 1,800 projects undertaken during 20042005.
Sources of funding
The annual budget is approximately $28 million. Contracts account for approximately 75% of
SRC’s revenues and government investment for the remaining 25%. Of the contracts, 60% are
awarded by industry and 40% from various levels of government.
Volunteer contributions
The value of volunteer contributions is not assessed but is estimated to be greater than $400K per
year. 400K is the sum of the volunteer contributions of the 9 member board of directors which is
estimated at $100K, and the contributions of the members of the five 15 member industry
advisory committees, estimated at $300K.
Impact
The SRC strives to provide quality of life and environmental benefits to the citizens of
Saskatchewan in addition to economic benefits. A conservative estimate of the 2004-2005
economic benefits is $270 million. In addition, the SRC estimates that during 2004-2005
approximately 2000 jobs were created or saved as a result of its work. The SRC served 1,800
clients during 2004-2005.

71

<-----Page 64----->Occasionally the SRC’s research projects led to very significant economic benefits for the
province. For example, the SRC developed a process for using carbon dioxide(CO2) injections to
facilitate the recovery of oil. Besides being an efficient method for recovering the remaining oil
from depleted reservoirs, the process has the added benefit of sequestering excess CO2
underground where it doesn’t create environmental problems. EnCana Resources has used the
process to generate an additional 120 million barrels of oil generating some $6 billion in
revenues.
Organizational changes
In 1996 the SRC created a for-profit subsidiary called TecMark International which assists
entrepreneurs with technology assessment and commercialization. In 2000 the act governing the
SRC was amended to allow it to take equity stakes in companies in exchange for the provision of
R&D services.
Changes in mission
Since 2001 SRC has shifted towards a greater focus on work valued by industry. This shift has
been accompanied by a shift in funding sources to the point where approximately 75% of SRC’s
resources come from contracts and 25% from government. Of the contracts, 60% are awarded by
industry and 40% from various levels of government. As a public agency the SRC can undertake
more public-good projects than could a more strongly industry–driven organization.
What difficulties does your organization encounter in its efforts to promote the ability of
firms to develop and deploy new products, services, or processes?
The SRC has two major obstacles to increased value creation. The first is financial, with a great
financial commitment from the province the Council could undertake work of greater depth and
breadth. The second problem is related and concerns insufficient support for organizations
operating in the space between publicly supported technology development and privately
supported business activities. The activities in this space, which is sometimes referred to as the
‘valley of death’, include pilot testing of large scale processes and prototype development. Both
public and private investors are reluctant to invest in such activities because they share both the
high risk profile of earlier stage research and technology development and the high cost profile of
downstream commercialization activities.
For example, recently the SRC saw the need to upgrade its fermentation plant from laboratory
grade to commercial grade. The laboratory grade plant is currently used by Saskatchewan firms
and university researchers to develop high-value, low volume biological products. The benefit of
upgrading the facility to be capable of producing commercial grade products is that it makes the
process of transitioning production from the laboratory process to the commercial process, as
required for clinical and field trials, more seamless and therefore less susceptible to the
introduction of errors. Upgrading the SRC’s facility was an expensive proposition, on the order
of $3 million. Moreover, while local firms declared a strong interest in having the upgraded
facility available, they were unwilling to commit to sample or production volumes. This was a
high risk, high cost venture of the type that investors are reluctant to fund. Fortunately in this
case the governments of Saskatchewan and Canada both came forward and the upgrade is
underway but this is exactly type of opportunity to create value that is passed by too often.
What could your organization do with to promote the ability of firms to develop and deploy
new products, services, or processes if it had a new three-year project funded at 30% of
your annual budget?
With increased funding on the order of $9 million SRC would create a kind of business incubator
for the process industry. Such a capability would allow SRC to take technology from the pilot
stage to the commercial stage. The facility would be complemented by a fund to do
demonstration projects.
