THE BIG IDEA
In this book, author Daniel Goleman reveals the skills that distinguish star
performers in every field, from entry level jobs to middle-level to top executive
posts. The book shows that the single most important factor is not IQ, advanced
degrees, or technical expertise, but the quality called “Emotional Intelligence.”
This book shows that we all possess the potential to improve our emotional
intelligence – at any stage in our careers, as individuals or as team members in
an organization.

The New Yardstick
The rules for work are changing. We’re being judged by a new yardstick: not just
by how smart we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how we handle
ourselves and each other. This is increasingly applied in choosing who will be
hired and not, who will be let go or retained. In a time with no guarantee of job
security, when the very concept of a job is being replaced by “portable skills,”
these are prime qualities that make and keep us employable. Talked about
loosely for decades under a variety of names, from “character” and “personality”
to “soft skills” and “competence,” there is at last a more precise understanding of
these human talents: emotional intelligence.

Some Misconceptions
•

•

•

First, emotional intelligence does not mean merely “being nice,” but rather,
for example, bluntly confronting someone with an uncomfortable but
consequential truth they have been avoiding.
Second, emotional intelligence does not mean giving free rein to feelings.
Rather, it means managing feelings so that they are expressed
appropriately and effectively, enabling people to work together smoothly
toward their common goal.
Lastly, levels of emotional intelligence are not fixed genetically, nor does it
develop in early childhood. Unlike IQ, which changes little after our teen
years, emotional intelligence seems to be largely learned, and it continues
to develop through life and learn from our experiences.

What Employers Want
A survey of American employers reveals that more than half the people who work
for them lack the motivation to keep learning and improving in their job. Four in
ten are not able to work cooperatively with fellow employees, and just 19 percent
of those applying for entry-level jobs have enough self-discipline in their work
habits. More and more employers are complaining about the lack of social skills
in new hires.

The Limits of IQ
Given how much emphasis schools and admissions tests put on it, IQ alone
explains surprisingly little of achievement at work or in life. When IQ test scores

Page 3

are correlated with how well people perform in their careers, the highest estimate
of how much difference IQ accounts for is about 25 percent. This means that IQ
alone at best leaves 75 percent of job success unexplained.

Expertise
In large part, expertise is a combination of common sense plus the specialized
knowledge and skill we pick up in the course of doing any job. Expertise comes
from in-the-trenches learning. It shows up as an insider’s sense of the tricks of a
trade – the real knowledge of how to do a job that only experience brings. Be that
as it may, expertise is a “threshold requirement.” The abilities that distinguish the
outstanding supervisors in technical fields are not technical, but rather relate to
handling people.

Emotional Intelligence
Here’s a cautionary tale about two students, Penn and Matt. Penn was a brilliant
and creative student, an exemplar of the best Yale had to offer. The trouble with
Penn was he knew he was exceptional – and so was, as one professor put it,
“unbelievably arrogant.” Even so, he looked spectacular on paper. When he
graduated, Penn was highly sought after. He got a lot of invitations for job
interviews. But Penn’s arrogance came across all too clearly; he ended up with
only one job offer from a second-tier outfit. Matt, on the other hand, wasn’t as
academically brilliant. But he was adept interpersonally. Everyone who worked
with him liked him. Matt ended up with seven job offers out of eight interviews
and went on to success in his field, while Penn was let go after two years at his
first job. Penn lacked – and Matt had – emotional intelligence.

Emotional Competence
Emotional Competence is a learned capability based on emotional intelligence
that results in outstanding performance at work. Our emotional intelligence
determines our potential for learning the practical skills that are based on its five
elements: self-awareness, motivation, self-regulation, empathy, and adeptness in
relationships. Our emotional competence, on the other hand, shows how much of
that potential we have translated into on-the-job capabilities. For instance, being
good at serving customers is an emotional competence based on empathy.
Likewise, trustworthiness is a competence based on self-regulation, or handling
impulses and emotions well. Both customer service and trustworthiness are
competencies that can make people outstanding in their work. Simply being high
in emotional intelligence does not guarantee a person will have learned the
emotional competencies that matter for work; it means only that they have
excellent potential to learn them.

The Leadership Edge
Emotional competence is particularly central to leadership, a role whose essence
is getting others to do their jobs more effectively. Interpersonal ineptitude in
leaders lowers everyone’s performance: it wastes time, creates acrimony,
corrodes motivation and commitment, builds hostility and apathy. A leader’s

<-----Page 3----->Working With Emotional Intelligence

Page 4

strengths or weaknesses in emotional competence can be measured in the gain
or loss to the organization of the fullest talents of those they manage.

Talents for These Times
Claudio Fernandez-Araoz, in charge of executive searches throughout Latin
America from Egon Zehnder International’s Buenos Aires office, compared 227
highly successful executives with 23 who failed in their jobs. He found that the
managers who failed were almost always high in expertise and IQ. In every case
their fatal weakness was in emotional intelligence – arrogance, over reliance on
brainpower, inability to adapt to the occasionally disorienting economic shifts in
that region, and disdain for collaboration or teamwork.

The Inner Rudder
A physician was once offered a business proposition: If he would leave his
practice to become medical director of a fledgling condominium health resort and
invest $100,000 of his own capital in the venture, his projected share of the
business would amount to $4 million within three years. Or so the business plan
promised. He liked the vision of a resort where people could improve their health
as they vacationed; coupled with the lure of a possibly fantastic payoff he
couldn’t resist. He sold his medical practice, invested in the resort, and became
its medical director. But during the start-up year he found that there was no
medical program to direct yet – he ended up spending his days essentially as a
salesman, trying to interest people in buying time-share condos at the resort.

The Power of Intuition: The First Thirty Second
Credit managers must sense when a deal might go bad even if the numbers look
fine; executives have to decide whether a new product is worth the time and
money it takes to develop; people must make an educated guess about who
among a field of candidates for a job will have the best chemistry in a working
group. All such decisions demand the capacity to fold into the decision-making
process our intuitive sense of what is right and wrong. Intuition and gut feeling
bespeak the capacity to sense messages from our internal store of emotional
memory – our own reservoir of wisdom and judgment. This ability lies at the heart
of self-awareness.

Emotional Awareness: Recognizing One’s Emotions and Their
Feelings
People with this competence:
• Know which emotions they are feeling and why
• Realize the links between their feelings and what they think, do and say
• Recognize how their feelings affect their performance
• Have a guiding awareness of their values and goals

Managing Your Career
The drive to establish ourselves and make our mark in the world is most urgent in
our twenties and thirties, and into our forties. But by our mid-forties and early
fifties people typically reevaluate their goals, because they often come to the
radical realization that life is limited. With this acknowledgement comes a
reconsideration of what really matters.
As the saying goes: “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you
there.” The less aware we are of what makes us passionate, the more lost we will
be. And this drifting can even affect our health; people who feel their skills are not
being used well on the job, or who feel their work is repetitive and boring, have a
higher risk of heart disease than those who feel that their best skills are
expressed in their work.

Accurate Self-Assessment
People with the ability to self-assess are:
• Aware of their strengths and weaknesses
• Reflective, learning from experience
• Open to candid feedback, new perspectives, continuous learning, and
self-development
• Able to show a sense of humor and perspective about themselves

Self-Confidence
People with this competence:
• Present themselves with self-assurance; have “presence”
• Can voice views that are unpopular and go out on a limb for what is right
• Are decisive, able to make sound decisions despite uncertainties and
pressures

The Managed Heart
Emotional self-regulation includes not just damping down distress or stifling
impulse; it can also mean intentionally eliciting an emotion, even an unpleasant
one. Some bill collectors, some say, prime themselves for calls on people by
getting themselves worked up into an irritable, ill-tempered state. Physicians who
have to give bad news to patients or their families put themselves into a suitably
somber, dour mood, as do morticians meeting with bereaved families. But best of
all, working up changes in emotional states is satisfactory if the need for such a
change is relative to work we love to do. For a nurse who sees herself as a
caring, compassionate person, taking a few moments to console a patient in
distress represents not a burden but what makes her job more meaningful.

Self-Regulation
Self-regulation means managing impulse as well as distressing feelings. It
depends on the working of the emotional centers in tandem with the brain’s
executive centers in the prefrontal areas. These two primal skills – handling
impulse and dealing with upsets – are at the core of five emotional
competencies:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Self-control: Managing disruptive emotions and impulses effectively
Trustworthiness: Displaying honesty and integrity
Conscientiousness: Dependability and responsibility in fulfilling obligations
Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change and challenges
Innovation: Being open to novel ideas, approaches, and new information

Flow
Joe Kramer can fix anything. A welder who helps assemble railroad cars in
Chicago, Joe is the guy everyone calls on when any piece of machinery breaks
down. He loves the challenge of finding out what makes a machine work. He
started as a boy, fixing his mother’s toaster, and from there, he can’t stop
tinkering with machines and find out how they tick, or how to deal with them
when they conk out. Joe is an example of people who find their work exhilarating
– and who perform at their best. They key to that exhilaration is not the task itself
– Joe’s job is often routine – but the special state of mind he creates as he
works. A state called “flow.” Flow moves people to do their work, no matter what
work they do. Flow blossoms when our skills are fully engaged. The challenge
absorbs us so much we lose ourselves in our work, becoming so totally
concentrated we may feel “out of time.” In this state, we seem to handle
everything effortlessly, nimbly adapting to shifting demands. Flow itself is a
pleasure and the ultimate motivator.

Loving What Pays Off
People in flow often make the difficult look easy, an external appearance that
mirrors what is happening in their brain. Flow poses a neural paradox: We can be
engaged in an exceptionally demanding task, and yet our brain is operating with
a minimal level of activity or expenditure of energy. The reason seems to be that
when we are bored and apathetic, or frenzied with anxiety, our brain activity is
diffused; the brain itself is at a high level of activation, albeit poorly focused, with
brain cells firing in far-flung and irrelevant ways. But during flow, the brain
appears efficient and precise in its pattern of firing. The result is an overall
lowering of cortical arousal – even though the person may be engaged in an
extremely challenging task.

Achievement Drive
People with this competence:
• Are results oriented, with a high drive to meet their objectives and
standards
• Set challenging goals and take calculated risks

Page 7

Pursue information to reduce uncertainty and find ways to do better
Learn how to improve their performance

Commitment
People with this competence:
• Readily make sacrifices to meet larger organizational goal
• Find a sense of purpose in the larger missions
• Use the group’s core values in making decisions and clarifying choices
• Actively seek out opportunities to fulfill the group’s mission

Empathy Begins Inside
As Freud observed, “Mortals can keep no secret. If their lips are silent, they
gossip with their fingertips; betrayal forces its way through every pore.” Sensing
what others feel without their saying so captures the essence of empathy. Others
rarely tell us in words what they feel; instead they tell us in their tone of voice,
facial expression, or other nonverbal ways. The ability to sense these subtle
communications builds on more basic competencies, particularly self-awareness
and self-control. Without the ability to sense our own feelings – or to keep them
from swamping us – we will be hopelessly out of touch with the moods of others.
Empathy is our social radar. Lacking such sensitivity, people are “off.” Being
emotionally tone deaf leads to social awkwardness, whether from misconstruing
feelings or through a mechanical, out-of-tune bluntness or indifference that
destroys rapport. One form this lack of empathy can take is responding to other
people as stereotypes rather than as the unique individuals that they are.

Understanding Others
People with this competence:
• Are attentive to emotional cues and listen well
• Show sensitivity and understand others’ perspectives
• Help out based on understanding other people’s needs and feelings

The Art of Listening
Listening well and deeply means going beyond what is said by asking questions,
restating in one’s own words what you hear to be sure you understand. This is
“active” listening. A mark of having truly heard someone else is to respond
appropriately, even if that means making some change in what you do.

The Politics of Empathy
There is a politics of empathy: Those with little power are typically expected to
sense the feelings of those who hold power, while those in power feel less
obligation to be sensitive in return. In other words, the studied lack of empathy is
a way power-holders can tacitly assert their authority. But this may hold less true
today since more organizations are becoming more team-oriented and less stiffly
hierarchical. The demands of modern leadership now include competence at

<-----Page 7----->Working With Emotional Intelligence

Page 8

empathy; the authoritarian style of the past just doesn’t work as well as it once
did.

Developing Others
People with this competence:
• Acknowledge and reward people’s strengths and accomplishments
• Offer useful feedback and identify people’s needs for future growth
• Mentor, give timely coaching, and offer assignments that challenge and
foster a person’s skills

The Art of Influence
The Art of Influence entails handling emotions effectively in other people. Star
performers are artful at sending emotional signals, which makes them powerful
communicators, able to sway an audience. In short, they are leaders.

Emotions are Contagious
We influence each other’s moods. Influencing another person’s emotional state
for better or for worse is perfectly natural; we do it constantly, “catching”
emotions from one another like some kind of social virus. This emotional
exchange constitutes an invisible interpersonal economy, part of every human
interaction, but it is usually too subtle to notice. Emotions as a signaling system
needs no words – a fact evolutionary theorists see as one reason emotions may
have played such a crucial role in the development of the human brain long
before words became a symbolic tool for humans.

Influence
People with this competence:
• Are skilled at winning people over
• Fine-tune presentations to appeal to the listener
• Use complex strategies like indirect influence to build consensus and
support
• Orchestrate dramatic events to effectively make a point

First, Build Rapport
Empathy is crucial for wielding influence. It is difficult to have a positive impact on
others without first sensing how they feel and understanding their position.
People who are poor at reading emotional cues and inept at social interactions
are very poor at influence. The first step in influence is building rapport.

Communication: Listening Openly
and Sending Convincing Messages
People with this competence:
• Are effective in give-and-take, registering emotional cues in attuning their
message
• Deal with difficult issues straightforwardly

Listen well, seek mutual understanding, and welcome sharing of
information fully
Foster open communication and stay receptive to bad news as well as
good

Conflict Management: Negotiating
and Resolving Disagreements
People with this competence:
• Handle difficult people and tense situations with diplomacy and tact
• Spot potential conflict, bring disagreements into the open, and help deescalate
• Encourage debate and open discussion
• Orchestrate win-win solutions

Resolving Conflict – Creatively
Here are some classic moves for cooling down conflicts:
• First, calm down, tune in to your feelings, and express them
• Show a willingness to work things out by talking over the issue rather than
escalating it with more aggression
• State your point of view in neutral language rather than in an
argumentative tone
• Try to find equitable ways to resolve the dispute, working together to find a
resolution both sides can embrace

Leadership: Inspiring and Guiding Individuals and Groups
People with this competence are:
• Articulate and arouse enthusiasm for a shared vision and mission
• Step forward to lead as needed, regardless of position
• Guide the performance of others while holding them accountable
• Lead by example

When to be Tough
To be sure, leadership demands a certain toughness – at times. The art of
leadership entails knowing when to be assertive – for example, confronting
someone directly about their performance lapses – and when to be collegial and
use less direct ways to guide or influence. Leadership demands tough decision
making. Someone has to tell people what to do and hold them for their
obligations. A common failing of leaders, from supervisors to top executives, is
the failure to be emphatically assertive when necessary. One obstacle to such
assertiveness is passivity, as can happen when someone is more concerned
about being liked that with getting the job done right. People who are extremely
uncomfortable with confrontation or anger are also often reluctant to take an
assertive stance even when it is called for.

The Change Catalyst: Key Ingredients
Today, organizations are reshuffling, divesting, merging, acquiring, flattening
hierarchies, going global. The acceleration of change through the 1900s has
made the ability to lead it a newly ascendant competence. In addition to high
levels of self-confidence at such pace, effective change leaders have high levels
of influence, commitment, motivation, initiative and optimism, as well as an
instinct for organizational politics to see organizations through such change.

Survival of the Social
Humans are the primordial team players: Our uniquely complex social
relationships have been a crucial survival advantage. Our extraordinary
sophisticated talent for cooperation culminates in the modern organization. The
view of the crucial role of cooperation in evolution is part of a radical rethinking of
just what the famous phase “survival of the fittest” means. One modern legacy of
this past is the radar for friendliness and cooperation most of us have. People
gravitate to those who show signs of good qualities. We also have a strong
warning device or system that alerts us to someone who may be selfish or
untrustworthy.

The Art of Collaboration
John Seely Brown, chief scientist at Xerox Corporation and a cognitive theorist
himself, points out that the crucial nature of social coordination is perhaps
nowhere more evident than in today’s scientific enterprises, where cutting-edge
knowledge grows through orchestrated, collaborative efforts. The art of “making
an impact through people,” Brown says, “is the ability to pull people together, to
attract colleagues to the work, to create the critical mass for research. Then,
once you’ve done that, there’s the next question: How do you engage the rest of
the corporation? And then, how do you get the message out and convert the rest
of the world? To communicate is not just a matter of pushing information at
another person. It’s creating an experience, to engage their gut – and that’s an
emotional skill.”

The Group IQ
What makes a team perform better than the best person on it? The question is
key. Outstanding team performance raises the “group IQ” – the sum total of the
best talents of each member on a team, contributed to their fullest. When teams
operate at their best, the results can be more than simply additive – they can be
multiplicative, with the best talents of one person catalyzing the best of another
and another, to produce results far beyond what any one person might have
done. The explanation of this aspect of team performance lies in the member’s
relationships – in the chemistry between members.

Building Bonds: Nurturing Instrumental Relationships
People with this competence:
• Cultivate and maintain extensive informal networks

Seek out relationships that are mutually beneficial
Build rapport and keep others in the loop
Make and maintain personal friendships among work associates

Bring in the Relationship Managers
Marks & Spencer, the huge British retail chain, gives an unusual gift to its regular
suppliers: a special key card that lets them into the chain’s head offices anytime.
Although they still have to make appointments, the key card makes them feel like
members of the Marks & Spencer family. This is exactly the point. The key card
is part of an intentional effort of Marks & Spencer to nurture a relationship of trust
and cooperation with its suppliers. That effort also includes trips with suppliers to
trade shows and to other countries to visit sources of raw materials. The goal: to
strengthen mutual understanding, as well as to spot new possibilities for products
they can jointly develop.

Collaboration and Cooperation
People with this competence:
• Balance a focus on task with attention to relationships
• Collaborate, sharing plans, information and resources
• Promote a friendly, cooperative climate
• Spot and nurture opportunities for collaboration

Feelings and the Client
When a client displayed anxiety or uneasiness, the common wisdom in the
insurance industry held that the best response was not empathy but a rational
argument. So the advisors were left trying to shut out the client’s emotions as
well as their own. In short, the feelings rolling within clients and planners alike set
a miserable emotional tone for their encounter, as a final report put it, “A
mountain of emotional negativity stood between our sales process and our
bottom line.”

The Emotionally Intelligent Organization
At an international business conference recently, people were asked, “Does your
organization have a mission statement?” About two thirds raised their hands.
Then they were asked, “Does this mission statement describe the day-to-day
reality of life there?” All but a few raised their hands. An emotionally intelligent
organization needs to come to terms with any disparities between the values it
proclaims and those it lives. Clarity about an organization’s values, spirit and
mission leads to a decisive self-confidence in corporate decision making.

Maximizing the Organization’s Intelligence
An organization’s collective level of emotional intelligence determines the degree
to which that organization’s intellectual capital is realized – and so its overall
performance. The art of maximizing intellectual capital lies in orchestrating the
interactions of the people whose minds hold that knowledge and expertise. When

Page 12

it comes to technical skills and core competencies that make a company
competitive, the ability to outperform others depend on the relationships of the
people involved.

The Bottom Line
Emotional intelligence can be learned. Individually, we can add these skills to our
tool kit for survival at a time when job stability seems like a quaint oxymoron. For
businesses of all kinds, the fact that emotional competencies can be assessed
and improved suggests another area in which performance – and so
competitiveness – can be upgraded. What’s needed amounts to an emotional
competence tune-up for the corporation.
