The central mathematical
concept that underlies logistic

regression is the logit?the
ratio. The simplest example of a logit derives from a 2 x 2
contingency table. Consider an instance in which the distri
bution of a dichotomous outcome variable (a child from an
inner city school who is recommended for remedial reading
classes) is paired with a dichotomous
predictor variable
(gender). Example data are included in Table 1. A test of

predicts the logit of Y from X. As stated earlier, the logit is the
natural logarithm (In) of odds of 7, and odds are ratios of

Analysis

For the sake of illustration, we constructed a hypothetical
data set to which logistic regression was applied, and we
interpreted its results. The hypothetical data consisted of
reading scores and genders of 189 inner city school children
(Appendix A). Of these children, 59 (31.22%) were recom
mended
for remedial reading classes and 130 (68.78%)
were not. A legitimate research hypothesis posed to the data
was that "the likelihood that an inner city school child is
recommended for remedial reading instruction is related to
both his/her reading score and gender." Thus, the outcome
variable,

Analysis

A two-predictor logistic model was fitted to the data to
test the research hypothesis
regarding the relationship
between the likelihood that an inner city child is recom
mended for remedial reading instruction and his or her read
ing score and gender. The logistic regression analysis was
carried out by the Logistic procedure in SAS? version 8

(SAS Institute Inc., 1999) in theWindows

Unlike discriminant function analysis, logistic regression
does not assume that predictor variables are distributed as a
multivariate
normal distribution with equal covariance
matrix. Instead, it assumes that the binomial distribution
describes the distribution of the errors that equal the actual
Y minus the predicted Y. The binomial distribution is also
the assumed distribution for the conditional mean of the
outcome. This assumption

the regression coefficient for predictor X, then exponentiat

held at a constant, the odds ratio means the change in the

for informing public policy

1999). Three condi

of Eight Articles

Using Logistic

Regression

To help understand how logistic regression has been
applied by authors of articles published in The Journal of
Educational Research (JER), we reviewed articles that used
this technique between 1990 and 2000. During this period,
eight articles were found to have used logistic regression.
The criterion used in selecting articles was simple: at least
one empirical analysis in the article must have been con
ducted to derive the logistic model
cients. This criterion excluded any
ers' work to derive the model

list of these eight articles

A breakdown of the articles by year showed that, prior to
1993, there was no article that used logistic regression. In
1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997, one article per year applied
logistic regression; in 1998 and 2000, there were two per
year. This trend mirrors the pattern that was found in high
er education journals (Peng et al, 2002, except that the rise
of logistic regression began a year earlier, in 1992, in high
er education

journals.

The

research questions addressed in the eight articles
included American

(Alexander, Dauber, & Entwisle,
1996; McNeal,

Smith, 1997), students at-risk (Meisels & Liaw, 1993; Rush
& Vitale, 1994), family connectedness
(Machamer & Gru
ber, 1998), and parents' conceptions of kindergarten readi
ness (Diamond, Reagan, & Bandyk, 2000). One central
theme shared by all was education-related
adjustment and
performance. The dependent variable was dichotomous,
whether it was retention in school, dropping-out from high
school, or readiness for kindergarten. The predictors typi
