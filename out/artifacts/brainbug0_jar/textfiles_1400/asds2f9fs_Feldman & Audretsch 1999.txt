Abstract
Whether diversity or specialization of economic activity better promotes technological
change and subsequent economic growth has been the subject of a heated debate in the
economics literature. The purpose of this paper is to consider the effect of the composition of economic activity on innovation. We test whether the specialization of economic
activity within a narrow concentrated set of economic activities is more conducive to
knowledge spillovers or if diversity, by bringing together complementary activities, better
promotes innovation. The evidence provides considerable support for the diversity thesis
but little support for the specialization thesis.  1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
In proposing a new theory of economic geography, Paul Krugman (1991b,
p. 5) asks, ‘What is the most striking feature of the geography of economic
activity? The short answer is surely concentration2production is remarkably
concentrated in space.’ Perhaps in response to Krugman’s concern, a literature
has recently emerged which focuses on the implications of the concentration of
economic activity for economic growth. Models posited by Romer (1986, 1990),
Lucas (1993), and Krugman (1991a,b) link increasing returns to scale yielded by
externalities within a geographically bounded region to higher rates of growth.
The results of Jaffe (1989), Jaffe et al. (1993), Feldman (1994) and Audretsch and
Feldman (1996) suggest that R&D and other knowledge spillovers not only
generate externalities, but the evidence also suggests that such knowledge
spillovers tend to be geographically bounded within the region where the new
economic knowledge was created. New economic knowledge may spill over, but
the geographic extent of such knowledge spillovers is bounded. Lucas (1993)
emphasizes the most natural context in which to understand the mechanics of
economic growth is in metropolitan areas where the compact nature of the
geographic unit facilitates communication. Indeed, Lucas (1993) asserts that the
only compelling reason for the existence of cities would be the presence of
increasing returns to agglomerations of resources which make these locations
more productive.
None of these studies, however, ask the question, ‘Does the specific type of
economic activity undertaken within any particular geographic region matter?’
This question is important because a recent debate has arisen focusing precisely
on the composition of economic activity within an agglomeration and how such
externalities will be shaped by that composition of economic activity. One view,
which Glaeser et al. (1992) attribute to the Marshall—Arrow—Romer externality,
suggests that an increased concentration of a particular industry within a specific geographic region facilitates knowledge spillovers across firms. By contrast,
Jacobs (1969) argues that it is the exchange of complementary knowledge across
diverse firms and economic agents which yields a greater return to new economic knowledge.
There are clear policy implications of this debate in terms of policies directed
towards innovation and technological change. If the specialization thesis is
correct, then policy should focus on developing a narrow set of economic
activities within a geographic region in order to yield greater innovative output.
On the other hand, if the diversity thesis is correct, then a geographic region
comprised of a diverse set of economic activities will tend to yield greater output

 This mirrors an earlier debate summarized by Loesch (1954).

in terms of innovative activity. The key policy concerns would then become how
to identify the commonalties and how to foster such diversity.
The purpose of this paper is to penetrate the black box of geographic space
by identifying the extent to which the organization of economic activity is
either concentrated, or alternatively consists of diverse but complementary
economic activities, and how this composition influences innovative output.
To consider this question we link the innovative output of product categories within a specific city to the extent to which the economic activity of that
city is concentrated in that industry, or conversely, diversified in terms
of complementary industries sharing a common science base. We use results on
the relevance of academic departments to R&D from Levin et al. (1987) to
identify complementary industries across which knowledge spillovers may be
realized. We find a tendency for innovative activity in complementary industries
sharing a common science-base to cluster together in geographic space. Industries which use the same base of scientific knowledge exhibit a strong tendency
to locate together for both the location of production and the location of
innovation.
In Section 2, we introduce the main theories alternatively favoring diversity
or specialization in generating innovative activity. Issues concerning the
measurement of innovative activity, the geographic unit of observation and the
concepts of science-based diversity and specialization are examined in Section 3.
After the model is presented in the Section 4, the empirical results are provided
in Section 5. To explore the validity of our results, we extend our analysis to
consider the impact of specialization versus diversity of economic activity within
the firm on innovative activity in Section 6. We find considerable evidence
rejecting the specialization thesis and in support of the diversity thesis. Based on
the findings for both industries within specific cities as well as for individual
firms, an organizational structure of economic activities that are diverse, but still
complementary, apparently yields a greater innovative output than a specialization of economic activity.

2. Diversity versus specialization
The importance of location to innovation in a world increasingly relying upon
E-mail, fax machines, and electronic communications superhighways may seem
surprising, and even paradoxical at first glance. The resolution of this paradox
lies in the distinction between knowledge and information. While the costs of
transmitting information may be invariant to distance, presumably the cost of
transmitting knowledge, especially what Von Hipple (1994) refers to as sticky
knowledge, rises with distance. Von Hipple persuasively demonstrates that
highly contextual and uncertain knowledge is best transmitted via face-to-face
interaction and through frequent contact. Proximity matters in transmitting

<-----Page 3----->412

M.P. Feldman, D.B. Audretsch / European Economic Review 43 (1999) 409—429

knowledge because, as Arrow (1962) pointed out, such sticky knowledge is
inherently non-rival in nature and knowledge developed for any particular
application can easily spill over and be applied to different use and applications.
Indeed, Griliches (1992) has defined knowledge spillovers as ‘working on similar
things and hence benefiting much from each other’s research’.
Despite the general consensus that knowledge spillovers within a given
location stimulate technological advance, there is little consensus as to exactly
how this occurs. Glaeser et al. (1992) characterize three different models from
the literature that would influence the production of innovation in cities.
The Marshall—Arrow—Romer model formalizes the insight that the concentration of an industry in a city promotes knowledge spillovers between firms and
therefore would facilitate innovation in that city-industry observation. This type
of concentration is also known as industry localization (Loesch, 1954). An
important assumption is that knowledge externalities with respect to firms exist,
but only for firms within the same industry. Thus, the relevant unit of observation
is extended from the firm to the region in the theoretical tradition of the
Marshall—Arrow—Romer model and in subsequent empirical studies, but spillovers are limited to occur within the relevant industry. The transmission of
knowledge spillovers across industries is assumed to be non-existent or at least
trivial.
Restricting knowledge externalities to occur only within the industry may
ignore an important source of new economic knowledge—inter-industry spillovers. Jacobs (1969) argues that the most important source of knowledge
spillovers are external to the industry in which the firm operates and that cities
are the source of innovation because the diversity of these knowledge sources is
greatest in cities. Thus, Jacobs develops a theory that emphasizes that the
variety of industries within a geographic region promotes knowledge externalities and ultimately innovative activity and economic growth. Of course, there
should be some basis for interaction between diverse activities. A common
science base facilitates the exchange of existing ideas and generation of new ones
across disparate but complementary industries. Thus, in Jacobs’ view, diversity
rather than specialization is the operative mechanism of economic growth.
A second controversy involves the degree of competition prevalent in the
region, or the extent of local monopoly. The Marshall—Arrow—Romer model
predicts that local monopoly is superior to local competition because it

 Considerable evidence suggests that location and proximity clearly matter in exploiting knowledge spillovers. Not only have Jaffe et al. (1993) found that patent citations tend to occur more
frequently within the state in which they were patented but Audretsch and Stephan (1996) and
Audretsch and Feldman (1996) found that the propensity for innovative activity to cluster geographically tends to be greater in industries where new economic knowledge plays a more important
role.

<-----Page 4----->M.P. Feldman, D.B. Audretsch / European Economic Review 43 (1999) 409—429

413

maximizes the ability of firms to appropriate the economic value accruing from
their innovative activity. By contrast, Jacobs (1969) and Porter (1990) argue
that competition is more conducive to knowledge externalities than is local
monopoly. It should be emphasized that by local competition, Jacobs (1969)
does not mean competition within product markets as has traditionally envisioned within the industrial organization literature. Rather, Jacobs is referring
to the competition for the new ideas embodied in economic agents. Not only
does an increased number of firms provide greater competition for new ideas,
but in addition, greater competition across firms facilitates the entry of a new
firm specializing in some particular, new, product niche. This is because the
necessary complementary inputs and services are likely to be available from
small specialist niche firms but not necessarily from large, vertically integrated
producers.

3. Measurement issues
Krugman (1991a, p. 53) has argued that economists should abandon any
attempts at measuring knowledge spillovers because ‘2knowledge flows are
invisible, they leave no paper trail by which they may be measured and tracked’.
But as Jaffe et al. (1993, p. 578) point out, ‘knowledge flows do sometimes leave
a paper trail’ — in particular in the form of patented inventions and new product
introductions.
In this paper we rely upon a direct measure of innovative output, rather than
on a measure of intermediate output, such as patented inventions. This United
States Small Business Administration’s Innovation Data Base (SBIDB) is the
primary source of data for this paper. The database consists of new product

 Porter (1990) provides examples of Italian ceramics and gold jewelry industries in which
numerous firms are located with a bounded geographic region and compete intensively in terms of
product innovation rather than focusing on simple price competition.
 A recent series of country studies assembled by Reynolds et al. (1994) show that new-firm
start-up rates tend to be greatest in those geographic regions where the average number of firms per
employee is the greatest.
 Scherer (1983), Mansfield (1984) and Griliches (1990) have all warned that the number of
patented inventions is not the equivalent of a direct measure of innovative output. For example,
Pakes and Griliches (1984, p. 378) argue that ‘patents are a flawed measure of innovative output;
particularly since not all new innovations are patented and since patents differ greatly in their
economic impact’. In addressing the question, ‘Patents as indicators of what?’ Griliches (1990, p.
1669) concludes that, ‘Ideally, we might hope that patent statistics would provide a measure of the
innovative output2The reality, however, is very far from it. The dream of getting hold of an output
measure of inventive activity is one of the strong motivating forces for economic research in this
area’.
 A detailed description of the SBIDB is contained in Audretsch (1995).

<-----Page 5----->414

introductions compiled form the new product announcement sections of over
100 technology, engineering and trade journals spanning every industry in
manufacturing. From the sections in each trade journal listing new products,
a database consisting of the innovations by four-digit standard industrial
classification (SIC) industries was formed. These innovation data have been
implemented by Audretsch (1995) to analyze the relationship between industry
dynamics and technological change, and by Audretsch and Feldman (1996),
Feldman (1994) and Feldman and Florida (1994) to examine the spatial distribution of innovation.
There are several important qualifications that should be made concerning
the SBIDB. The trade journals report mainly product innovations. Thus, as is
the case in the studies by Audretsch (1995) and Audretsch and Feldman (1996),
the empirical analyses undertaken in this paper capture product innovation but
not process innovation.
Another potential concern might be that the significance and ‘quality’ of the
innovations vary considerably. In fact, each innovation was classified according
to one of the following levels of significance: (1) the innovation established an
entirely new category of product; (2) the innovation is the first of its type on the
market in a product category already in existence; (3) the innovation represents
a significant improvement in existing technology; and (4) the innovation is
a modest improvement designed to update an existing product. About 87% of
the innovations were in this fourth category and most of the remaining innovations were classified in the third category. However, the preliminary nature of
such classifications leads us to treat the innovations as being homogeneous.
While such an assumption will hopefully be improved upon in the future,
it is consistent with the voluminous body of literature treating dollars of
R&D, numbers of scientists and engineers, and numbers of patents as being
homogeneous.
An important strength of the database is that the innovating establishment is
identified as well as the innovating enterprise. While this distinction is trivial for
single-plant manufacturing firms, it becomes important in multi-plant firms.
This is because some innovations are made by subsidiaries or divisions of
companies with headquarters in other states. Even though the headquarters
may announce new product innovations made by the company, the database
still identifies the individual establishment responsible for the majority of the
work leading to the innovation.

 An anonymous referee points out that the implicit assumption that innovations are homogeneous in their impact is found in most studies attempting to measure innovative activity. As Griliches
(1990) emphasizes, this limitation has plagued studies using counts of patents, just as it has in those
based on R&D expenditures or R&D scientists and engineers.

<-----Page 6----->M.P. Feldman, D.B. Audretsch / European Economic Review 43 (1999) 409—429

The innovations from the SBIDB are then classified according to the fourdigit SIC industry of the new product and the city where the innovating
establishment was located. We adapt either the Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as the
spatial unit of observation. The analysis here is based on 3969 new manufacturing product innovations for which the address of the innovating establishment
could be identified.
In 1982 the most innovative city in the United States was New York. Seven
hundred and thirty-five, or 18.5%, of the total number of innovations in the
country were attributed to firms in the greater New York City area. Four
hundred and seventy-seven (12.0%) were attributed to San Francisco and 345
(8.7%) to the Boston area and 333 (8.4%) to the Los Angeles area. In total, 1890,
or 45% of the innovations, took place in these four consolidated metropolitan
areas. In fact, all but 150 of the innovations included in the database are
attributed to metropolitan areas. That is, less than 4% of the innovations
occurred outside of metropolitan areas. This contrasts with the 70% of the
population which resided in these areas.
Of course, simply comparing the absolute amount of innovative activity
across cities ignores the fact that some cities are simply larger than others. Cities
vary considerably in terms of measures of city size, and we expect that city scale
will have an impact on innovative output. Table 1 presents the number of
innovations normalized by the size of the geographic unit. Population provides
a crude but useful measure of the size of the geographic unit. Cities in Table 1
are ranked in descending order by innovation rate or the number of innovations
per 100,000 population. While New York has the highest count of innovation, it
has the third highest innovation rate. The most innovative city in the United
States, on a per capita measure of city size, was San Francisco, with an
innovation rate of 8.90, followed by Boston, with an innovation rate of 8.69. By
contrast, the mean innovation rate for the entire country is 1.75 innovations per
100,000 population. The distribution of innovation rates is considerably skewed.
Only 14 cities are more innovative than the national average. Clearly, innovation appears to be a large city phenomenon.
To systematically identify the degree to which specific industries have a common underlying science and technology base, we rely upon a deductive approach that links products on their closeness in technological space. We use the
widely acknowledge and established ½ale Survey of R&D managers. This survey
is documented in great detail in Levin et al. (1987) and has been widely used in
studies linking various mechanisms of appropriability to R&D activity (Cohen

and Levinthal, 1990; Levin et al., 1987). The survey uses a Likert scale of 1 to 7,
from least important to most important, to assess the relevance of basic scientific
research in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, mathematics, medicine, geology, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. We assume any
academic discipline with a value greater than 5 to be relevant for a product
category. For example, basic scientific research in medicine, chemistry and
chemical engineering is found to be relevant for product innovation in drugs
(SIC 2834).
We then identify six groups of industries which rely on similar rankings for
the importance of the different academic disciplines. These six groups, shown in
Table 2, reflect distinct underlying common scientific bases. To facilitate identification of the groupings we assigned a name to each group that reflects not only
the underlying science base but also the application to which this knowledge is
directed. Thus, what we term as the ‘chemical engineering’ and ‘industrial
machinery’ groups actually include the same critical academic departments
(ranked differently), but applied to different types of industries.
While each industry within the group shares a common scientific base, the
geographic space and product space differ across industries. For example, there

industries. For example, Atlanta is a prominent center for innovative activity
stemming from the common science base of agra-business. While the national
innovation rate was 20.34 innovations per 100,000 manufacturing workers,
agra-business in Atlanta was almost five times as innovative.
A Chi-Squared test on the independence of the location of city and sciencebased industrial activity reveals that neither the distribution of employment nor the distribution of innovative activity is random. Industries which
rely on a common science base exhibit a tendency to cluster together geographically with regard to the location of employment and the location of
innovation. We conclude that the distribution of innovation within sciencebased clusters and cities appears to reflect the existence of science-related
expertise.

4. Modeling framework
To test the hypothesis that the degree of specialization shapes the innovative
output of an industry, we estimate a model where the dependent variable is the
number of innovations attributed to a specific four-digit SIC industry in a particular city. To reflect the extent to which economic activity within a city is
specialized, we include as an explanatory variable a measure of industry specialization which was used by Glaeser et al. (1992) and is defined as the 1982 share
of total employment in the city accounted for by industry employment in the
city, divided by the share of United States employment accounted by that
particular industry. This variable reflects the degree to which a city is specialized in a particular industry relative to the degree of economic activity in
that industry that would occur if employment in the industry were randomly
distributed across the United States. A higher value of this measure indicates
a greater degree of specialization of the industry in that particular city. Thus,
a positive coefficient would indicate that increased specialization within a city is
conducive to greater innovative output and would support the Marshall—Arrow—Romer thesis. A negative coefficient would indicate that greater specialization within a city impedes innovative output and would support Jacobs’ theory
that diversity of economic activity is more conducive to innovation than is
specialization.
To identify the impact of an increased presence of economic activity in
complementary industries, the presence of science-based related industries is
included. This measure is constructed analogously to the index of industry
specialization, and is defined as the share of total city employment accounted
for by employment in the city in industries sharing the science base,
divided by the share of total United States employment accounted for by
employment in that same science base. This variable measures the presence of
complementary industries relative to what the presence would be if those related industries were distributed across the United States. A positive coefficient of the presence of science-based related industries would indicate that
a greater presence of complementary industries is conducive to greater innovative output and supports for the diversity thesis. By contrast, a negative
coefficient suggests that a greater presence of related industries sharing
the same science base impedes innovation and argues against Jacobs’ diversity
thesis.
The usual concept of product market competition in the industrial organization literature is typically measured in terms of the size-distribution of firms. By
contrast, Jacobs’ concept of localized competition emphasizes the extent of
competition for the ideas embodied in individuals. The greater the degree of
competition among firms, the greater the extent of specialization among those
firms and the easier it will be for individuals to pursue and implement new ideas.
Thus, the metric relevant to reflect the degree of localized competition is not the

size of the firms in the region relative to their number (because, after all, many if
not most manufacturing product markets are national or at least inter-regional
in nature) but rather the number of firms relative to the number of workers. In
measuring the extent of localized competition we again adopt a measure used by
Glaeser et al. (1992), which is defined as the number of firms per worker in the
industry in the city relative to the number of firms per worker in the same
industry in the United States. A higher value of this index of localized competition suggests that the industry has a greater number of firms per worker relative
to its size in the particular city than it does elsewhere in the United States. Thus,
if the index of localized competition exceeds one then the city is locally less
competitive than in other American cities.
The data for these measures are from County Business Patterns. Table 4
presents the variable definitions and descriptive statistics for the measures of

Table 5 presents the regression results based on the 5946 city-industry observations for which data could be collected. The Poisson regression estimation
method is used because the dependent variable is a limited dependent variable
with a highly skewed distribution.

 The number of innovations in a city and product category is either zero or some positive integer.
The mean of the distribution is 0.26 and the standard deviation is 2.96.

Model 1 provides the results for the three measures which reflect the degree of
specialization, diversity and localized competition. The negative and statistically
significant coefficient of industry specialization suggests that innovative activity
tends to be lower in industries located in cities specialized in economic
activity in that industry. The positive and statistically significant coefficient
for science-based related industries indicates that a strong presence of
complementary industries sharing a common science base is particularly conducive to innovative activity. Taken together, these results provide support for
the diversity thesis but not for the specialization thesis. The negative coefficient
on the measure of localized competition suggests that less and not more
localized competition promotes the innovative activity of an industry in a particular city.
One concern regarding the estimation of Model 1 is that larger cities might be
expected to generate a greater amount of innovation in any particular industry,
ceteris paribus, simply because of a greater degree of economic activity. In
addition, the extent of localized competition might tend to be greater as the size
of the city grows. Thus, when the total employment is included in the estimation
of Model 2, the sign of the coefficient for localized competition switches from
negative to positive, suggesting that a greater degree of localized competition is
conducive to innovative activity. At the same time, the signs of the coefficients of
the measures of industry specialization and science-based related industries
remain unchanged.
Another concern regarding the estimation of Model 1 is that some industries
are more innovative, or in a higher technological opportunity class than others.
But even after controlling for the number of innovations recorded for the

<-----Page 13----->422

M.P. Feldman, D.B. Audretsch / European Economic Review 43 (1999) 409—429

relevant industry in the estimation of Model 3 and Model 4, the basic results
remain the same.
The results in Table 5 generally provide support that it is diversity and not
specialization that is more conducive to innovation. It should be emphasized
here that even after we control for city scale and technological opportunity,
specialization appears to have a negative effect on innovation, while sciencebased diversity has a positive impact on innovative output. In addition, the
evidence suggests that a greater extent of localized competition and not monopoly tends to promote innovative output. Of course, the cross-sectional city level
data do not provide any insight into whether these patterns are stable over time.

6. Diversity versus specialization at the firm level
The debate between specialization and diversity of economic activity and the
impact on technological change is also relevant at the level of the firm and
allows a further test of the effects of these influences on innovation. We expect
a similar result in the organization of innovation within the firm — undertaking
innovative activity across a range of science-based complementary activities will
lead to greater innovative output than concentrating innovative activity within
one industry. With this test we seek to ascertain if analogous processes operate
at both the firm and the geographic level.
Jewkes et al. (1958) examined the histories of 61 innovations and found that
a variety of different approaches within the firm are often pursued. It appears
that diversity in terms of the number and the type of approaches used serves to
reduce the uncertainty inherent in innovation by providing a greater number of
unique ideas and outcomes. In an empirical examination of this question, Cohen
and Malerba (1995) find a strong relationship between technological diversity
and the rate of technical advance at the industry level. Our consideration of
specialization examines the degree to which the firm focuses its innovative
activity on one product category.
In order to model the effects of science-based diversity and specialization
at the level, we follow the pioneering study of Scherer (1983) to estimate a

 The extent to which these relationships are non-linear was examined in the estimation with the
inclusion of quadratic terms for industry specialization and localized competition. The results
indicate that, in fact, cities which are highly specialized in economic activity may actually generate
more innovative output in that industry. This result does not hold when city scale is included. It
appears that scale is more important than the rate of change in the degree of specialization. The
quadratic of localized competition suggests that there may be increasing returns to innovative
output resulting for increased localized competition. Again, this result does not hold when urban
scale is considered.

where I represents the total number of innovations attributed to firm I in the

the extent to which the innovative activity of firm I is diversified across related
product categories we calculate the share of innovations in the same common
science base product categories divided by the total number of innovations
introduced by the firm. Similarly, specialization, or own industry share, is
measured as the proportion’s of the firm’s innovative activity in the primary
industry identified with the firm.
R&D expenditures are taken from the Business ¼eek 1975 sample of over 700
corporations for which R&D expenditures play an important role. An important feature of this sample is that it included more than 95% of the total
company R&D expenditures undertaken in the United States. There is a seven
year lag between the 1982 innovations and the 1975 R&D expenditures. This lag
may be somewhat long in view of a number of studies in the literature. However,
as long as firm R&D expenditures are relatively stable over a short period of
time, differences in the assumed lag structure should not greatly impact the
results.
Table 6 indicates the most innovative firms in the database along with the
corresponding R&D expenditures, sales, R&D/sales ratio and the number of
innovations per R&D dollar. As we might expect a positive relationship can be
observed between the size of the R&D budget and innovative output, but there
is also great variation in the productivity of R&D. Some firms such as Data
General appear to obtain a relatively high degree of innovation per R&D dollar
expended. Other firms such as General Electric and RCA exhibit a considerably
lower R&D yield.
The regression results from estimating the model of firm innovative activity
are shown in Table 7. The positive relationship between R&D inputs and

possible to identify firm-level R&D by location at this point.
 As an anonymous referee emphasizes, future research needs to explore distributed lags between
R&D and innovative output.

innovative output can be observed in Model 1. The negative coefficient of the
quadratic term suggests that although innovative output tends to respond
positively to increased investments in R&D inputs, the rate of increase in
innovative output diminishes as R&D inputs increase.
When the measure of innovation diversity within industries sharing a common science base is included in Model 2, the positive coefficient provides
support for the hypothesis that diversification across complementary economic
activities is conducive to greater innovative output. When the measure of
innovation specialization is included in Model 3, the positive coefficient suggests

that greater specialization in innovation yields greater innovative output.
When both specialization and diversity are included together in Model 4,
the coefficient of specialization exhibits a negative coefficient suggesting that
greater innovation specialization is less conducive to greater innovative
output. On the other hand, holding R&D expenditures constant, greater innovative diversity within the common science base results in more innovative
output.
The firms can also be grouped according to major two-digit SIC sectors.
Results for six specific industrial sectors are listed in Table 8. There is interesting
variation in these results across manufacturing sectors. For example, in instruments and telecommunications diminishing returns to R&D inputs can be
observed. By contrast, increasing returns to R&D can be observed in the group
of firms classified as conglomerates, and in electrical equipment and transportation no significant relationship can be observed between R&D and innovative
output.
While the links between R&D inputs and innovative output vary substantially across sectors in Table 8, the relationships between specialization, innovation diversity and innovation remain remarkably constant across sectors. For
all six sectors the coefficient of the measure of science-based innovation diversity
remains positive and statistically significant, and the coefficient of the measure
of innovation specialization also remains negative and statistically significant in
all six sectors. Thus, the main finding that diversity in innovation activities
within a common science base tends to promote innovative output more than
does the specialization of innovation within just one single industry holds across
a broad range of industrial sectors.

The results are confirmed in Table 9, which groups the firms according
to two of the largest science bases — high-tech computing and biomedical
products. Not only is the knowledge production function found to hold for
firms in each of these distinct science bases, but again, diversity in innovation

across economic activities with a common science base is found to increase
innovation.

7. Conclusions
The nature and utility of knowledge is at the heart of the economics of R&D,
innovation and technological change. Whether diversity or specialization of
economic activities better promotes technological change has been the subject of
a heated debate in the economics literature. This paper has attempted to shed
light on that debate by linking the extent of diversity versus specialization of
economic activities to innovative output. By focusing on innovative activity for
particular industries at specific locations, we find compelling evidence that
specialization of economic activity does not promote innovative output. Rather,
the results indicate that diversity across complementary economic activities
sharing a common science base is more conducive to innovation than is
specialization. In addition, the results indicate that the degree of local competition for new ideas within a city is more conducive to innovative activity than is
local monopoly.
A second perspective explored in this paper is the effect of diversity and
specialization at the firm level. The results indicate that innovative activity tends
to be lower when that innovation is specialized within a narrow industry than
when it is diversified across a complementary set of industries sharing a common science base. Thus, the results at both the level of the firm as well as for the
industry across geographic space present a consistent view of the returns to
specialization versus diversity of economic activity. Our results suggest that
diversity across complementary industries sharing a common base — a crucial
qualification — results in greater returns to R&D.
Increasingly scholars of technological change realize that external sources of
knowledge are critical to innovation. Our results suggest that the boundaries of
the firm are but one means to organize and harness knowledge. An analogous
means of organizing economic activity are spatially defined boundaries. Geographic location may provide another useful set of boundaries within which to
organize innovation. Geography may provide a platform upon which knowledge may be effectively organized.

 We underscore the descriptive nature of these results since there may be alternative explanations. Specifically, the relationships may be endogenous in a way that we have not considered. Firms
which are more innovative may be more profitable and therefore, more likely to be able to engage in
diverse activities. Similarly, regions which are successful at innovation in one industry may attract
other activities. The cross-sectional nature of the data we use here does not allow us to examine these
issues.
