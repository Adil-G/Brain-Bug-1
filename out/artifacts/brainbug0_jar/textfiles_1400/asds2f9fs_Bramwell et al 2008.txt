BRAMWELL A., NELLES J. and WOLFE D. A. Knowledge, innovation and institutions: global and local dimensions of the ICT
cluster in Waterloo, Canada, Regional Studies. This paper presents research findings on the information and communication technology (ICT) cluster in Waterloo, Ontario. Cluster dynamics in Canada do not conform to some of the key assumptions in the
literature on clusters that emphasize the importance of local intra-cluster dynamics based on inter-firm linkages at the local level.
The results of this case study indicate that many inter-firm linkages in the Waterloo ICT cluster are non-local, and that extra-firm
institutional supports, such as the local university and industry association, are critical in sustaining and strengthening the cluster.
Knowledge-based cluster theories that emphasize the role of local and global knowledge flows and learning processes, and the
interaction effect of civic capital and local institutions in supporting the development of a local ‘learning economy’, provide
more compelling explanations for the resilience of the ICT cluster in Waterloo, Ontario.

INTRODUCTION
The emergence of a globalizing, knowledge-based
economy has accentuated the challenges facing both
firm managers and government policy-makers,
especially at the local level. Concern with both emerging sources of global competition and the necessity
of continuous innovation has focused their attention
on the available strategies to respond to these challenges.
This in turn has led to a growing fascination with industrial clusters due to the perceived relation between clustering and enhanced competitiveness and innovative
performance (PORTER et al., 2001). A substantial scholarly, business, and policy literature exists on clusters and
it is growing rapidly. The basic drivers of clustering,
localization and urbanization economies are known,
although significant controversy about the nature of
externalities occurs among approaches to the subject.
In general, the literature distinguishes between two
key drivers that contribute to clustering: agglomeration
economies and privileged access to knowledge flows,
but various authors attribute differing degrees of significance to their relative importance.
Another key issue involves the role of local factors
versus the global dimension of cluster development.
Clusters are primarily viewed as local phenomena,
and hence the focus of local economic development
agencies. Ultimately, competition occurs between and
among clusters in competing industries, often internationally. But there are relatively few examples of international, industry-wide comparisons of competing

clusters and practically no knowledge of the international
dynamics of cluster rivalry. By the same token, much
more is known about the internal linkages of clusters
than about their external linkages, which are usually
market-related. However, there is increasing evidence
that external linkages, especially in smaller, open economies, drive the internal dynamics of clusters. Some of
the most recent studies point to the increasing specialization of clusters within the global economy, as individual
clusters in photonics, for instance, have come to specialize in particular technology and sectoral niches.
The case of the information and communication
technology (ICT) cluster in Waterloo, Ontario, is
instructive for developing a better appreciation of the
implications of these factors for the process of cluster
formation. The industrial cluster in the Kitchener –
Waterloo– Cambridge (Waterloo) region, located an
hour west of Toronto, is one of the most dynamic
sources of high-tech activity in Canada. Geographically,
Canada’s Technology Triangle (as the region is also
known) encompasses the four municipalities of Waterloo,
Cambridge, Kitchener and Guelph. Overall, the region
boasts 455 companies involved in the high-technology
sector. The companies are spread across four subsectors: information and communication technology,
scientific and engineering services, advanced manufacturing, and the life sciences, biotech and environmental
sub-sector. Of these, information and communications
technology accounts for 62% of the high-tech firms
and employs 13 000 people or 45% of the total in the
high-tech sector (COMMUNITECH TECHNOLOGY

<-----Page 3----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

Global and Local Dimensions of the ICT Cluster in Waterloo, Canada
ASSOCIATION, 2005). Unlike other concentrations of
high-tech activity in Canada, the economy of the Waterloo region is not dominated by one particular sector, such
as telecommunications or Internet-based firms. This
diversity has enabled the regional economy to weather
economic shocks – such as the post-2000 dot-com meltdown – that devastated employment in other leading
ICT clusters across the country.
Since its early days as a bustling manufacturing
centre, the Waterloo region has been an important
point on the Southern Ontario industrial landscape. It
has been home to major nationally and internationally
successful corporations for more than a century, from
Dominion Electrohome Ltd to present day success,
Research in Motion. This paper presents the findings
of recent empirical research on the ICT cluster in the
Waterloo region, and examines the role that various
factors have played in its growth and dynamism.1
Tracing patterns of strategic and locational decisionmaking, unpacking the constellation of relationships
among actors in the region and characterizing the
nature of the regional culture in the Waterloo area,
yields a wealth of information about the knowledge
flows that underpin the process of cluster formation
and development. While recent studies of the innovation process emphasize that it is grounded in the
regional or local level in dense networks of geographically proximate firms engaged in related types of
activity, including both regional systems of innovation
and the more localized industry clusters, the results of
this study indicate that non-local linkages and knowledge flows emerge as more powerful explanatory variables for cluster dynamics than some of the literature
would suggest.
To explore the relationships between firms and
among firms and local institutions in Waterloo, and
the influences affecting their growth and performance,
the paper employs a broad analytical framework that
combines aspects of the cluster, innovation systems
and social learning literatures. The authors gathered
qualitative data on five sets of factors: firm research
strategies and innovation processes; networks of
relationships between producers, suppliers, and customers; locational advantages; the role of supporting institutions, both local universities and government research
institutes; and the nature of associational activity and
other manifestations of civic capital in the cluster. The
case study of the Waterloo ICT cluster was part of a
broader national study of 26 industrial clusters across
Canada that used a common research framework to
evaluate the relative importance of and interdependence
between these five sets of factors in the development of
the individual clusters through empirical evidence collected from interview data.
Studies of cluster formation, structure and dynamics
are characterized by the lack of a universally accepted
methodological approach (WOLFE and GERTLER ,
2004; ASHEIM et al., 2006). A qualitative case study

103

method, using semi-structured interviews as the
primary method of data collection, was chosen for
this study because it is best suited to the task of capturing
the diversity of regionally-based innovation dynamics
and the roles and relationships of the major actors
involved. Based on the view that learning and innovation are inherently social processes, the research objective was to capture the non-linear, iterative, and
interactive nature of cluster dynamics. Previous studies
of industrial clusters, such as the analyses of Silicon
Valley and Route 128, confirm that in-depth interviews
provide a fruitful method for gathering this type of
insight into cluster dynamics (SAXENIAN, 1994). This
paper presents findings from 93 in-depth interviews
carried out during 2003 and 2004, using a consistent
interview protocol. The interviews were conducted
with a broad range of stakeholders, including senior
representatives of large or ‘lead’ firms, mid-sized and
smaller firms, the local university and community
college, local venture capitalists, municipal and provincial governments, and representatives of civic associations were interviewed, but the paper focuses
primarily on firm level responses over those of other
actors. The interview data has been supplemented
with survey data collected by the local high-tech industry association (COMMUNITECH TECHNOLOGY
ASSOCIATION, 2005).

KNOWLEDGE AND SPILLOVERS IN
CLUSTER FORMATION
Within the literature on clusters, two perspectives
account for the dynamic nature of clusters and the
economic benefits they confer. The first approach,
dating back to the work of the Cambridge University
economist Alfred Marshall (1842– 1924), views clusters
as the product of traditional agglomeration economies,
where firms co-located in the cluster benefit from the
easier access to, and reduced costs of, certain collective
resources such as a specialized inputs, infrastructure, or
access to a local labour market for specialized skills.
This perspective is highlighted in the work of Michael
Porter, who emphasizes the benefits attributed to traditional agglomeration economies by setting out the
competitive advantages derived from the microeconomic effects of the four elements that comprise his
‘diamond’. The four elements of the microeconomic
foundations of regional competitiveness include:
factor input conditions, demand conditions, the
context for firm strategy and rivalry, and finally, the presence of related and supporting industries that include
locally based suppliers and firms in related industries
(PORTER et al., 2001). While Porter has been criticized
for presenting both an industrial and spatial conception
of clusters, in the latter versions of his work, the intensity of interaction among the four elements of the
diamond is increased if the firms involved are located

Allison Bramwell et al.

close to each other. However, recent critiques have
raised the objection that in smaller, more open economies
the tendency for the intense pattern of local interaction
Porter describes is greatly diminished. The co-located
firms may draw upon knowledge sources and suppliers
from outside of the cluster and often they specialize in
different niches of the market (WOLFE et al., 2005).
This raises the critical question of what exactly draws
the clustered firms to a particular location and holds
them there. A further question arises as to exactly how
local knowledge flows occur within the local cluster
and what is the relative importance of inter-firm linkages
and the linkages between firms and other supporting
institutions in the cluster (ASHEIM et al., 2006).
A growing number of analysts have begun to address
these lacunae in the argument, in part by focusing
more directly on the nature of knowledge flows
within and between clusters (BATHELT et al., 2004;
HENDRY et al., 2000). This knowledge-based approach
emphasizes the role of knowledge flows and learning
processes in sustaining clusters, and suggests that the
underlying dimension that confers competitive advantage on the firms in the cluster is shared access to a distinctive knowledge base (MASKELL , 2001; FELDMAN,
2000). In this respect, individual clusters draw upon
the broader knowledge assets found in the local or
regional innovation system, which are defined as the
institutional infrastructure supporting innovation
within the production structure of a region (ASHEIM
and GERTLER , 2006). These regional innovation
systems are characterized by broad knowledgenetwork capabilities across a range of industrial
sectors. The diversity of the local or regional knowledge base contributes to the greater potential range
of knowledge bases that firms can draw upon in the
innovation process (COOKE , 2005).
Firms in the Waterloo ICT cluster clearly benefit
from the rich historical legacy of the region’s manufacturing tradition and many of the local firms specialize in
niches that integrate elements of software or information technology with advanced manufacturing.
The knowledge-based approach to clusters also emphasizes that knowledge flows in clusters are not necessarily
restricted to the local level. While the robustness of
knowledge-sharing networks, or ‘buzz’, contributes to
the vibrancy of clusters on a local level, dynamic clusters
usually also develop strong connections to other clusters
through the international sharing of knowledge, or
‘global pipelines’ (BATHELT et al., 2004; GERTLER and
WOLFE , 2006). The issue of knowledge flows, particularly the tacit dimension of knowledge, and the relative
degree to which clusters draw upon local versus global
sources of knowledge emerges as a key theme in a
growing number of case studies, including that of the
Waterloo ICT cluster.
A second theme that emerges is the centrality of
skilled labour as the single most important local asset.
This endowment is created and maintained by the

attraction and retention of highly educated, potentially
mobile workers who are drawn to thick and deep
opportunity-rich local labour markets. This theme is
closely related to the previous one in that knowledge
diffusion occurs more rapidly among co-located firms
than widely dispersed ones due to the flows of highly
skilled individuals within the local labour market.
This element of the cluster concept ‘stresses the centrality of local labour market processes to the innovative
capacity, competitiveness and indeed existence of clusters. It is the dynamism of the local labour market
that . . . account(s) for the associated clusters’ dynamism’
(MALMBERG and POWER , 2006, p. 60).
Post-secondary educational institutions can play a
central role in the development of a local talent pool.
According to Gertler and Vinodrai, universities act as
anchors of creativity in producing, attracting and retaining highly skilled talent, while they simultaneously
create an open and tolerant attitude in the communities
in which they are located. This in turn reinforces the
conditions needed to attract and retain talent in the
local community (2005). In the Waterloo case, the University of Waterloo provides a particularly salient
example of the impact of post-secondary institutions
on the local labour pool: the founders of many firms
that populate the cluster are graduates of the university
and most local firms overwhelmingly cite the presence
of a strong local labour pool as a key factor in explaining
their presence in the region (BRAMWELL and WOLFE ,
2005).
A third and related theme is the role that extrafirm institutional supports play in strengthening and
sustaining the inter-firm dynamics within the
cluster. Underlying this theme is the insight that
many of the key factors that drive innovation and
competitiveness in firms lie outside the firms themselves. Marshall does not limit his account of industrial districts to the presence of external economies,
but also draws attention to the role of socio-cultural
factors which affect their institutional underpinnings
or the ‘social milieu’ of the district (ASHEIM , 2000,
p. 415). The presence or absence of key institutional
elements in a local or regional economy may affect
both their innovative capacity and their potential to
function as nodes for cluster development. Recent
studies emphasize the importance of local governments and economic development agencies adopting
sustained development strategies and the key role
played by civic entrepreneurs and local associations
in those strategies. The ability of a regional
economy to sustain the growth of dynamic clusters
may depend on its ability to develop the underlying
conditions of trust and civic capital that support
the local learning economy (WOLFE and NELLES,
2008).
This brief overview of some recent theoretical and
empirical research into the formation and growth of
clusters identifies the key themes of particular relevance

<-----Page 5----->Global and Local Dimensions of the ICT Cluster in Waterloo, Canada

to the process of cluster development in the Waterloo
region. While various approaches emphasize different
key factors in cluster formation, this paper emphasizes
the interdependence of key variables. A strong local
talent pool, a robust research and innovation capacity,
inter-firm collaboration at local and global levels, supportive institutional structures, and a measure of civic
capital are all critical factors; each one by itself is a
necessary, but not sufficient condition for dynamic clusters. Drawing upon the insights afforded by the various
perspectives outlined above, this analysis of the findings
from the study of the Waterloo ICT cluster suggests that
its success rests on a distinctive pattern of interaction
between the locational decisions of firms, local educational institutions and civic associations, and a
regional culture particular to the Waterloo area.

A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE WATERLOO
CLUSTER
Historically, the Waterloo region has been a centre of
manufacturing in the economy of south-western
Ontario. The region has had a pioneering presence in
most of the major technological advances in North
America, including automobiles, radio, processed
foods, financial services, biotechnology and computing.
Today, this history of technological leadership continues
in fields such as Internet-enabled wireless communications, software, aerospace, engineering, e-commerce,
robotics, and laser technology. The region is also home
to strong firms and employment in automotive,
advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, business and
financial services, education, environmental science,
food processing, furniture manufacturing, high-tech,
logistics and warehousing, research and development
(R&D), and telecommunications (CANADA’S TECH2
NOLOGY TRIANGLE , 2004).
Since 1976, the number of high-technology enterprises in the area has grown to a critical mass, starting
with a flurry of new firm formation that included a
combination of spin-offs from the university, in-migration
of firms from outside the region and independent startups (XU, 2003). Of these sources, university spin-offs
have had the greatest impact on the local economy.
The University of Waterloo’s Technology Transfer and
Licensing Office identified 106 spin-off companies
employing over 2000 people by the mid-1990s. Using a
somewhat different definition that included the transfer
of intellectual resources, the PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS ’ (2001a) study of regional economic benefits identified over 250 spin-off companies from the university.3
Independent start-ups and second and third generation
spin-offs also contributed greatly to the high-tech
growth in this period.4 The recent Waterloo Region
Tech Industry Profile reported that 52% of executive
respondents were alumni of local colleges or universities,
with the majority coming from the University of

105

Waterloo. In addition, 70% were the founders of their
own companies, with 31% per cent of these being serial
entrepreneurs who had created and sold a number of
companies (COMMUNITECH TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION, 2005, p. 13). Much of the university’s commercialization and spin-off success is attributed to its intellectual
property (IP) policy, which allows ownership of IP to rest
with the creator, thus encouraging the individual (faculty
or student) to commercialize the idea.
Over this period the role of the University has
evolved a great deal. Beyond spin-offs and its commercialization activities, the university serves the regional
economy in two other important ways: by providing a
strong pool of local talent and by transferring cuttingedge knowledge to local firms through R&D consulting
or joint research projects. One of the key innovations
adopted in the early days of the University was its cooperative education programme – the first and most
successful of its kind in Canada. The rotation of students
to industry and back to the classroom solidified already
tight relations with local industry. The reflexive relationship has allowed the curriculum to keep up with the
ever-changing technological frontiers of industry while
industry support of the programme helped fund the
acquisition of technology to enhance classroom learning
(NELLES et al., 2005).
Another significant development is a marked
increase in the level of formalized cooperation in the
local community. As the high-tech sector increased in
relative importance, several civic and business associations were formed to support the region’s competitiveness. In particular, Communitech, the local association
for high-tech firms, was created to represent their interests to the government, and provide networking opportunities, peer-to-peer mentoring, and other support
mechanisms for local high-tech entrepreneurs. The emergence of a critical mass of high-technology companies,
the resilience of the regional economy, and the presence
of anchor institutions and associations all signify that the
Waterloo region is home to a dynamic high-tech
economy. The question remains as to how this region
conforms to the various models of cluster dynamics
found in the literature discussed above. Certainly historical factors have played an important role in laying
the groundwork for the present day cluster. The following section explores firm-level strategies and linkages,
the institutional infrastructure and the cultural context
to analyse the factors that explain its internal dynamics
and functioning.

GLOBAL/LOCAL KNOWLEDGE FLOWS:
INTER-FIRM DYNAMICS IN THE
WATERLOO CLUSTER
In contrast to the stream of literature which stresses that
the most important cluster dynamics are those generated by the agglomeration effects of proximity to a

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

106

Allison Bramwell et al.

collective set of resources, the knowledge-based theory
of the cluster recognizes that relatively few clusters are
completely self-sufficient in terms of the knowledge
base they draw upon. As industrial economies evolve
towards the production of more complex technologies,
a growing number of firms draw upon sophisticated
organizational networks to provide key elements or
components of their final product. While some
elements of these technologies may be co-located
within an individual cluster, increasingly, important
parts of the network are situated across a wide array of
locations (BATHELT et al., 2004; STURGEON, 2003).
However, the precise mix of the global and local knowledge flows present in individual clusters varies considerably by cluster. In the most advanced clusters, a growing
proportion of the knowledge base is not exclusively
local. A marked pattern of stronger global (versus
local) relations emerges in recent studies of more
knowledge intensive clusters, such as opto-electronics.
One recent study of opto-electronics clusters in six
locations found that extra-regional commercial linkages
are more important than localized ones due to the
highly diversified nature of the end-user markets and
the complexity of the technologies involved in assembling an end product for the market. What the firms
in the clusters do share is their common linkage to
the leading institution or firm and their common interest in stimulating and maintaining the critical supply of
highly skilled labour (HENDRY et al., 2000).

Global/local dynamics between customers, suppliers and
competitors

Contrary to the view of clusters that emphasizes the
importance of dense networking relationships among
local firms, it is readily apparent from interviews with
software and ICT manufacturing firms in the Waterloo
cluster that the amount of inter-firm collaboration in
the form of key customer or supplier relationships is
relatively low. The interview data reveals that the
focus of most economic activity – key customers,
sources of supply, competitors, and important strategic
partnerships – for the vast majority of firms occurs at
the continental and/or global level. While larger firms
tend to be more focused on the global level, smaller
firms, regardless of whether their key customers are currently in Canada, also have a growing global reach, or
continental or global aspirations.5
A core theme that emerges in the study of inter-firm
dynamics is the fluid nature of relations between customers, suppliers and competitors in the cluster. Variation
in types of relationships is reflected in many different
combinations and permutations of inter-firm dynamics,
which are rendered more complex by virtue of the fact
that they occur at local/regional, national, global and
‘virtual’ levels. As one chief executive officer (CEO)
put it:

our recruiting is all local, our supply base is all over the
world, even service providers . . . all our manufacturing
service providers are close to home, our engineering
service providers and prototyping providers are all over
the place too. I mean you can e-mail stuff out and get
UPS back in so you kind of go where it’s quick and economical. People is local [sic], manufacturing is local, but
pretty much everything else is non-local.
(confidential interview, 2003)

Ultimately, many of the firms interviewed describe
co-location with customers, suppliers, or strategic partners as either unimportant or irrelevant. Of the firms
for which proximity to customers is important, only
very few have key local customers with whom they
are in regular contact, and many firms treat local and
non-local customers much the same, communicating
primarily by phone or e-mail regardless of proximity.
One respondent commented that the distinction
between local and global is very artificial: ‘We sell
exactly half of our product internationally versus the
other half to North America in general. Our partners
can just as easily be in Europe as in the States, so the distinction never comes up – it means less than nothing’
(confidential interview, 2003). Most local firms have
an explicitly global focus because for many, even their
largest customer contributes only a small percentage
of total revenue, so they compete globally for customers. This means that they have to ‘compete locally
on a global basis’, and find that they have to establish
some type of local customer interface capabilities to
serve their global customers.6 Customer relations –
both marketing and support – occur at a virtual level.
With ‘the Internet as the great equalizer’, customers
from all over the world can visit company websites to
extract required downloads and access ‘24/7 customer
support’. Firms can choose to visit customers on site
to deal with crises or complex issues, so proximity to
customers is not a huge factor.7
Supplier relationships evince similar patterns as the
vast majority of firms indicated that co-location with
suppliers was not particularly important. Here there is
some distinction between manufacturing and information technology (IT) firms. Manufacturing firms
tend to buy ready-made components, primarily from
the US. While some firms do have local suppliers,
they were typically not for key components, and
when it was for a key component, the reason they
sourced supplies locally was ‘not because they are local
but because the type of technology they provide is
more critical for us’ (confidential interview, 2003).
Local competition is also not particularly relevant
because no two companies in the Waterloo cluster do
exactly the same thing. The vast majority of ICT
firms operate within specific niches of their industry
segment. A distinctive theme emerged, however, with
respect to the relative degree of ‘transparency’ of particular industry and competitor relationships. Some
relationships are marked by closely guarded IP, a distinct

<-----Page 7----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

Global and Local Dimensions of the ICT Cluster in Waterloo, Canada
lack of linkages between similar firms, and sometimes
decidedly ‘unfriendly’ relations between competitors.
Others are more transparent, firms have a pretty good
idea of what other firms are offering, and people in
firms know each other and share collegial relationships
through regular interaction at conferences and sales calls.
With these collegial and transparent inter-competitor
relations, there is evidence of overlap between collaboration and competition – the idea of competitors as partners and collaborators as competitors – where ‘you can’t
help but buy subcomponents from somebody who you
are competing against in another area’ (confidential
interview, 2003). Other evidence of these types of
relationships emerges through the co-development of
a core technology, ‘we saw them as a competitor but
now we’re negotiating with them to start using our platform rather than developing their own’ (confidential
interview, 2003), or to make their technology consistent
with that of a large global competitor – ‘we have architected our tools to be complementary to them, leverage
their technology, leverage the investment that other
companies have made in their technology and make
both tool sets a little more effective, if not a whole lot
more effective’ (confidential interview, 2003)

Strategic partnerships

While firms may have some local partners who integrate their technology (or whose technology they integrate) into their product, key strategic partnerships,
especially for larger firms, tend to occur overwhelmingly at the non-local level, and most often in the
US and Europe. Key partnerships are often with a key
customer or a key supplier because ‘your clients typically become your partners – your best sources of innovative ideas’ (confidential interview, 2003). Local
partnerships, both formal and informal, tend to be
rather weak and take the form of short, project-oriented
collaborations, often on a contracting-out basis, with
key local customers. These linkages tend to be ‘more
relationships than formal alliances’. From an analytical
perspective, firm conceptions of what constitute a strategic partnership are inconsistent and the distinction
between key suppliers or customers and strategic partners with whom they share common ownership or IP
is not always clear, indicating that these relationships
are perhaps more fluid than is frequently understood.
Local partnerships tend to occur primarily between
smaller firms. There is some evidence of sub-clustering
at the local level, though the relationships are typically
‘soft’ and informal:
There’s another company here that, in fact has begun to
focus on X but from the other end . . . and we’re actually
assisting their launch . . . in the US . . . so I guess there is a soft
relationship with another company here that almost sounds like a
cluster. There’s another company locally in Burlington . . .
and they’re making the X that we’re using in our next

107

generation front ends, so there are in fact some suppliers
in this region that are developing world class electronics
that are relevant to this type of product. . . . We can
partner with them, we can talk with them about relevant
issues . . . it’s good to have these types of partnerships.
(confidential interview, 2003)

It is rare, but there is some evidence of robust partnering
activity between large globally oriented local firms and
smaller ones. The relationships are both formal and
informal, focused on taking-up useful solutions that
are generated by small local software firms, and are
often initiated through common customers. One
respondent identified this as a strength, ‘one of the
values of being located here is that you have a lot of
entrepreneurial small companies who are coming up
with interesting solutions that we can attach to our
offerings to round them out and bring them to
market’ (confidential interview, 2003). An alternative
to partnering with local or non-local firms for the
purpose of augmenting existing IP and product offerings for large firms is to simply acquire them.
To recap, Porter’s theory of cluster development
emphasizes geographically concentrated networks of
interrelated firms and innovation processes driven by
the presence of a sophisticated supply base, demanding
local customers and strong competition from other
local firms in the same industry. The evidence thus far
indicates that dense networks of activity between producers, customers and suppliers within the Waterloo cluster
are rare, and in fact, that local inter-firm relationships are
significantly weaker and more tangential to firm growth
than posited by Porter. It is international ties with customers located all over the world that constitute the
primary relationships of Waterloo high-tech firms. Consequently, it would seem that explanations for cluster
dynamics that privilege inter-firm relationships based
on proximity do not capture the whole story and that
explanations for firm locational decisions are found elsewhere in the Waterloo case. Nonetheless, a theme that
arises consistently is the importance of personal relationships; regardless of type, strength, or distance, many
interviewees stressed that their relationships with individuals in other firms was a key driver of firm activity:
It’s the relationship with the people and the relationship
for me strategically is not necessarily with the local
people, most of my relationships are with the people in
their head offices. Our company is more well known in
Irvine, California . . . than we are in Canada. We’re
more well known in the US, across the US and across
Western Canada than we are in our own home area.
(confidential interview, 2003)

SKILLED LABOUR: AN ABUNDANCE OF
TALENT AND SMART PEOPLE
Another corner of Porter’s diamond emphasizes factor
input conditions, including human capital, as a key

<-----Page 8----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

108

Allison Bramwell et al.

factor in the competitive dynamics of clusters. The
literature on learning regions emphasizes that, in the
current era of global competition in knowledge-based
industries, the local endowment of ‘talent’ in the
labour force is increasingly crucial to the growth and
prosperity of economic regions. The ability to train,
attract, and retain highly educated, potentially mobile
workers who are drawn to thick, deep, opportunityrich local markets is emerging as a crucial determinant
of firm and regional industrial success (FLORIDA ,
2003). Critical mass is important, because it sets in
motion a positive, self-reinforcing circle whereby
regions with a large number of highly skilled workers
in a particular sector are able to attract even more
workers of this kind. Results from the Waterloo study
indicate that the presence of a robust local talent pool
is indeed a central factor in the internal dynamics of
the local cluster, and that the local college and university
have been important actors in its development.
The interview data provide valuable insights into the
locational choices of firms, and can generally be categorized into ‘thin’ and ‘thick’ reasons for choosing to
locate in Waterloo. On the ‘thin’ end of the spectrum,
many people reported that the company was established
there because they ‘liked it’, but quality of life is a variable reported by many people to account for why they
choose to live where they do, so in itself, it does not
provide a convincing explanation for the location of
the high-tech cluster. Other people indicated that the
reasons why they started up in Waterloo are different
from the reasons why they stay, and stressed the serendipity of their locational decisions; they find that they
have come to rely on such advantages as the local
labour pool and the international cachet that the area
carries in technology circles. Others, however, indicated that there are ‘thicker’ or multivariate reasons
why the firm was established in Waterloo and why it
remains there. They stress the interdependence of
several key factors; the most often cited are the presence
of the university, and the quality of the local talent pool.
Ultimately, the availability of skilled, talented people
is consistently cited as the most critical input into their
competitive advantage because human capital is the
main input into software. Most firms indicated that it
was a distinct advantage to be located in Waterloo
because it provided a ready supply of ‘smart and competitively priced’ engineers and because the University of
Waterloo is ‘one of the best universities in the world for
computer engineering’. In terms of the relative cost of
building software in India, the US, Europe and
Canada, Canada, and specifically Waterloo, is seen to
be one of the best locations because of the quality and
productivity of the local talent pool relative to its cost.
While there is always the temptation to ‘move the
whole thing to India’ where the cost of labour is half,
cost is not the only consideration when it comes to
maintaining an innovative firm. The presence of large
software and technology intensive firms in the area,

serves as a magnet and an anchor for the highly specialized labour pool. Firms stay in the area because they
have invested in the local talent pool through inhouse training which has generated tacit knowledge
that is difficult to relocate. Some smaller firms indicated
that it is ‘important to be close to [large anchor] companies that are leading edge’ because they deepen the
labour pool, and smaller firms can hire people that
‘used to work at RIM . . . Descartes . . . MKS, and
others’.8 The following quote illustrates this relationship
between IT firms and their employees:
No question about it. If you take all the people out of the
building, you don’t have anything left except for a bunch
of machines out there that wouldn’t be any good to
anybody. . . . The area here, the Kitchener/Waterloo
area, is good because it has a good skill base. There is a
lot of good tool making people, a lot of good electricians,
and a lot of good universities in the area which we draw
on. We draw on the colleges for the technical people on
the mechanical side as well as on the software side.

Education and training for the local talent pool

The University of Waterloo is considered to be the
premier educational and research institution in the
cluster, but it is only one of the post-secondary institutions in the region that feeds graduates into the
local talent pool. Many firms indicate that the presence
of local universities was primarily relevant to them as a
source of skilled talent. The majority of local high-tech
firms require university educated employees, and in
many cases, most of the staff has at least a BSc, many
have MScs, and a large number of firms have several
staff members with a PhD, many in software engineering. While Waterloo is cited most often as the primary
source of new hires, especially out of the software
engineering programme, Wilfred Laurier University is
regularly mentioned as a source for junior marketing
and management people. Many firms, in both ICT
manufacturing and software, have a mix of universityeducated engineers and college-educated technicians,
and report that they actively recruit from the local community college, Conestoga College, for their technical
staff.
The influence of the local post-secondary institutions on the supply of highly educated and skilled
workers in the labour force is identified consistently as
a critical factor that drives the growth of the Waterloo
cluster. Whether or not they have other linkages with
the university, a clear majority of firms actively or regularly hire students from the co-op programme, have
hired them in the past, intend to start up again when
the economy improves, or are planning to do so in
the future, as the firm grows:
It all has to do with the proximity to the university and the
fact that a lot of our staff at this point, probably about 400
of our 2,000 staff went to Waterloo as an example, 100 or

<-----Page 9----->Global and Local Dimensions of the ICT Cluster in Waterloo, Canada

Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

more went to Laurier, 100 or more went to Conestoga . . .
there’s only so many places to go in Waterloo and this is
almost the self defining nature of a cluster. Once it starts
it seems to keep on going, but the thing that started it
off is some people who decided to stay here.
(confidential interview, 2003)

Three key benefits of Waterloo’s co-op programme
were reported. First and foremost, it acts as a steady
source of new hires, because firms know that the students have work experience, and they get the opportunity to evaluate them in the workplace before hiring
them. Second, co-op students act as an important
source of knowledge transfer; because they are
exposed to new ideas in their courses and bring these
ideas to their placements, ‘a lot of the students are on
the cutting edge of the products that we’re working
on, so we definitely get the benefit from that’. Finally,
Waterloo co-op students have an international reputation for being of high quality, and as a result, local
firms have to compete with global ones to attract the
best students, though they retain the benefit of location.
The growing international reputation of the University
is reflected in the recently staged corporate recruiting
drives by both Microsoft and Google, part of a
broader upsurge in hiring within the region. A recent
survey of 173 CEOs completed by Communitech
reported that 80% of the local firms are currently
hiring, with more than half expecting to add 20% to
their work forces in the next year (ROBERTSON,
2006). Aggressive hiring campaigns by the larger firms
in the cluster are currently putting pressure on the
supply of suitably trained personal for many of the
other firms. Although local firms complain about the
challenge of competing with top international employers, they recognize that it adds to the attractiveness of
the local talent pool:
We’re competing with Intel and Microsoft constantly for
those top students and I think Microsoft hires like 15%
of the graduating class and 15% of the co-ops there and
who wouldn’t want to go and work for Microsoft? So
we’re generally paying top dollar because we’re competing
against US folks but we’re also competing for the best of
the best. And I think we get way more than our share
here locally.
(confidential interview, 2003)

EXTRA-FIRM INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORTS:
THE UNIVERSITY AND ASSOCIATIONAL
ACTIVITY
A final theme found in the literature on cluster development is the role that extra-firm institutional supports
play in strengthening and sustaining inter-firm
dynamics within the cluster. There is a strong interdependence between the economic structure and social
institutions, both formal and informal, that comprise
the cluster, and many of the key factors that drive

109

innovation and competitiveness in firms lie outside
the firms themselves. The presence or absence of
these key institutional elements in a local or regional
economy may affect both their innovative capacity
and their potential to function as nodes for cluster
development. Waterloo firms are supported in the
innovation process by a highly innovative and engaged
local university, coupled with particularly robust and
community-oriented associational activity.
The embeddedness of the University of Waterloo

Several aspects characterize the nature of interaction
between local high-tech firms and the University of
Waterloo. First, while there are many formal relationships such as research contracts and funding of research
chairs, much of the knowledge exchange is more
informal than formal. Interviewees cite the university
not only as an important source of tech transfer and
specialized skills, but also as providing both international cachet to the region, and simple social/
professional networks; ‘I contact my friends there if I
have a problem’. This informal approach underscores
the ‘embeddedness’ of the university in the local community, and many people emphasize the organic
nature of the impact that the university has on the
local community through the interaction effect
between the various roles of the university – R&D
transfer, skills provision, international cachet, and
informal ‘knowledge networks’.
There is, however, a distinct division between those
firms that interact with the university and those that do
not. For those with linkages to the university, there is a
range in the depth and breadth of interaction. Larger
firms tend to have more robust partnering relationships,
often involving the funding of research chairs, longterm collaborative research projects, university faculty
working within the firm, and full-time staff occupied
with university and government interaction. Smaller
firms, in contrast, tend to engage in short-term,
problem-focused research projects. One of the
primary reasons cited for not becoming more involved
in university research is the amount of time required for
commercialization; while university research project
horizons might be two to three years, firms often
‘need to work on things that need to be commercialized
in 6– 18 months’. Others reported difficulty in accessing
what was available, not feeling ‘in the loop’, or had a
perception that the research efforts at the university
were focused on larger companies. Regardless of involvement with the university on an R&D level, however,
almost every firm cited its critical importance as a provider of
highly skilled and specialized talent.
With respect to federal or provincial research institutes and universities as sources of innovation, a few
trends were evident. First, universities were cited
much more often than government research institutes
or technology transfer centres as sources of innovation,

<-----Page 10----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

110

Allison Bramwell et al.

and many more firms indicated that they had some type
of relationship with a local university than with a government facility. Second, a few larger firms with
ongoing relationships to universities and government
labs, had a robust approach to R&D and partnering
generally, though this was more applicable to technology-intensive manufacturing firms than to software
firms. Third, most firms that interact with the university
engage in small, limited-term projects on an as-needed,
intermittent basis.
Most of the firms in the Waterloo high-tech cluster
are engaged in R&D. The Waterloo Tech Industry
Profile reported that 76% of the firms have R&D staff
located in the region totalling 2300 people. Large
firms accounted for 51% of the total number of R&D
staff. In addition to in-house staff, 22% of the firms
reported that they also use external sources for R&D
(COMMUNITECH
TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION,
2005, p. 11). There is a wide disparity in the R&D capabilities of large and small firms. Large firms typically
have robust in-house R&D units, although even small
ones typically have some type of in-house development
group that focuses on a core idea to get it market ready
or engages in small, limited one-off collaborative projects, or ‘skunk works’.9
The firms covered in this paper’s interviews indicated
that they are typically more focused on product development than exploratory research. The emphasis is predominantly on solutions-focused, incremental
innovations rather than research-intensive, first generation innovations. Product and process improvements
are intended to make the product ‘faster, smaller,
cheaper’ and often involve development activities such
as the modification of existing software platforms,
product updates and new releases, applying the core
technology to different applications within the same
factory, or making software web accessible. This
emphasis on performance improvement and finetuning reflects the trend toward what one observer
labelled ‘little R, big D’. However, there was also evidence of robust R&D capacity reflected in the strategic
decisions of large multinational firms, which often
choose to augment their R&D or other technological
capacity through the acquisition of local firms. Of particular interest is the fact that, while several large local
firms have acquired foreign (primarily European)
firms, several large foreign multinationals have acquired
indigenous Waterloo firms – Google being among the
most recent – to augment their R&D capabilities.
Large, global firms that collaborate with the university on long-term, core research projects, report that the
primary benefit of their collaboration is ‘getting the first
look’ at research results. They want to keep abreast of
what is happening at the research level, even though
they know they will not have any proprietary access
to the IP. Long-term research is by nature exploratory
and speculative, and if they see it being directly relevant
to the firm’s business strategy, they prefer to keep the

project within the company to avoid a potential conflict
over ownership of IP. Ongoing involvement in university-based research also gives them an inside eye on
developing university graduates who they may want
to hire. Firms also report the benefit of research collaboration with the university as increasing their global
reach and perspective by ‘magnifying your insight into
the global marketplace’ because research professors are
usually part of global networks of expertise in their particular research areas. The majority of firms, both large
and small, that report R&D linkages with a local university indicate that it is primarily for short-term research,
usually lasting a couple of months, on a ‘project by
project basis as needed’ and that the primary benefit
of collaboration is the ability to do problem-focused
research and small co-development projects that allow
them access to university expertise and laboratory
facilities.
The multiple roles of local universities and colleges as
R&D and technology transfer facilities, as well as suppliers of highly skilled talent, underscores the idea of
the embeddedness of educational institutions in the
Waterloo cluster. Regardless of whether firms had
formal or informal links to the university, most of
them cited the existence of local universities and colleges as a critical element of the cluster’s dynamics.
Some firms that are heavily networked with a local university describe a deeply synergistic relationship that has
emerged and endures as a result of the university being
located in Waterloo. Even firms with tangential or no
ties to the university – for example, those who only
hire co-op students or who comment simply on the
international cachet of the University of Waterloo –
cite the presence of the university as a critical factor.
In summary, the local universities are cited consistently
as an important source of R&D resources, spin-off
activity, and talented and educated people, as well as
many other types of formal and informal linkages. As a
result of the interdependence of these roles, and the
density of interaction with local firms, the universities
are embedded in the regional cluster as part of a virtuous
feedback cycle with the local high-tech community:
companies like us, although we licensed some technologies from the university we were fundamentally there
because we wanted to be close to the innovative and
active environment of the university, the source of students, co-op students, it was an exciting environment.
(confidential interview, 2003)

Civic capital: Communitech and high-tech hockey

Another factor that plays a significant role in the development of dynamic clusters is the ability of key actors
within the regional economy to develop the underlying
conditions of trust and civic capital that contribute to
the presence of a learning economy (WOLFE , 2002;
WOLFE and NELLES, 2008). The concentration of a

<-----Page 11----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

Global and Local Dimensions of the ICT Cluster in Waterloo, Canada
large number of high-tech firms is not sufficient to
transform a local economy into a vibrant cluster. It
also requires the presence of an ‘economic community’
mediated by strong networks and relationships that
bring together economic, social, and civic interests to
collaborate toward sustaining competitive advantage.
These can be created through the establishment of collaborative networks between business and civic communities (HENTON, et al., 1997). In Waterloo, the
existence of a strong and active business association
that under girds many of the inter-firm linkages lends
support to these theoretical assertions.
This paper’s research indicates that there exists a high
degree of ‘civic capital’ in the Waterloo region. The
regional culture is characterized by a robust ‘entrepreneurial spirit’ supported by a small and transparent
business community and well-developed business
associations, as well as a vibrant social network and
sense of community. There is a strong emphasis on
entrepreneurial activity in the region, and evidence
from the interviews suggests that the civic capital in
Waterloo is largely geared toward the promotion and
support of this entrepreneurial activity. Firms do not
interact by doing business with each other; rather, community networks are described as being built around
mentoring and problem-solving types of relationships –
the ‘how to’ of business, rather than the business itself.
Historical research and interview results provide some
insight into what elements contribute to the ‘stickiness’
or resilience of the high-tech cluster. Waterloo benefits
from the combination of a long and illustrious ‘industrial
family tree’ made up of early pioneers and current powerhouses, and a distinctive regional ‘entrepreneurial’ culture
supported, by a high degree of civic mindedness.10
The cluster literature suggests that an important contributing factor to cluster development is the presence
of local champions with a greater vision than single
firm success. RIM, Open Text, MKS, and Descartes
are all internationally recognized and established firms
in their respective industry segments. The interviews
confirmed that these anchor firms contribute to the
development of the cluster for mutually beneficial
reasons. When they were smaller, the ability to draw
on community resources was important for their
initial survival: ‘for our CEO to talk to similar CEOs
and get their advice on what to do and how to raise
money and all those good things were critical to the
foundation of our company’ (confidential interview,
2003). Now that they are a larger, more established
and less dependent on the local community for
success, certain successful firms ‘try to give back and
help local companies, and support the local universities
as much as [they] can’ (confidential interview, 2003).
Associational activity: a sense of (high-tech) community

A strong theme concerning the nature of business
relationships in the local community is the emphasis

111

placed on facilitating learning the ‘how to’ of business.
The informal type of knowledge transfers about the
business of doing business is one of the most striking
features of the region: ‘what it comes down to is we
had some licensing questions and so I just lobbed
some e-mails out to people in the software industry
locally here and got answers back. I think that there’s
a sense that we’re not competitive, we’re all in similar
industries just bound together’ (confidential interview,
2003). However, these relationships are not simply a
way to lower information and transaction costs; there
appears to be an important social component to them.
For example, there are several spontaneously formed
and voluntary user groups and ‘word of mouth’ networks that meet informally ‘down at the pub’, such as
software user groups, product management groups,
and a local software quality assurance engineering
society, some with voluntarily managed websites. It is
described as a peer network between local business
people who know each – as a business networking
cluster – because:
It is not any one industry. It is regional, for example around
here within 40 miles, there is a level of business people that
interact among themselves across multiple, industries that
may never actually use each others products or services
but have relationships and refer people to each other and
that to me is one of the core clusters around here.
(confidential interview, 2003)

Thus, the learning dimension of the local cluster
involves more than just technological learning, but
also involves the important dimensions of entrepreneurial and managerial skills. This is often one of the least
well documented, but most critical elements, of successful clusters. Entrepreneurial skill and market information can be transmitted through the cluster via a
variety of mechanisms – some formal and some informal – but one of the most effective is frequent peerto-peer mentoring and knowledge sharing that is organized through local civic associations (WOLFE and
GERTLER , 2004).
Many people have worked with each other on and
off over the years, some stay in contact with those
they worked with early in their careers, and some are
drawn back to Waterloo – part of the ‘brain drain
wash back’ phenomenon – by those relationships.
People know each other because they went to school
and subsequently worked together and have offices in
close proximity, and socialize together. They often
work for high-tech firms that share the same set of professional skills, but do not directly compete: ‘I mean, we
play high-tech hockey every week. So that sets up a bit
of a camaraderie, there’s some movement of staff from
company to company but so far its been on a pretty
polite basis, no ones gone out and done a lot of
raiding of a specific company’ (confidential interview,
2003). Generally speaking, networks are facilitated by
the critical mass and co-location of firms, but most of

<-----Page 12----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 18:28 15 September 2008

112

Allison Bramwell et al.

the interaction occurs on a peer-to-peer level. In this
respect, the Waterloo ICT cluster reflects the same ecological characteristics that have been used to describe
Silicon Valley, ‘Ecological robustness is built . . .
through shared practice, face-to-face contacts, reciprocity and swift trust, all generated within networks of
practice and communities of practice’ (BROWN and
DUGUID, 2000, p. 37).
In addition to informal relationships, there is a high
degree of formalized regional cooperation and associational activity in the Waterloo area, focused on facilitating the region’s economic competitiveness and
sustainability. The Communitech Technology Association, in particular, plays an important role in supporting regional economic development. Communitech
was cited most often for its facilitation and organization
of social and networking functions. The most frequently used Communitech programmes are its peerto-peer groups that are designed for employees in the
same position with different companies to meet and
share experiences, learn from each other and create a
forum for problem-solving.11 Again, the emphasis is
on the fact that firms do not do business with each
other, but do talk about how to do business with each
other. While Communitech is ‘not strategic from a customer point of view’, it is a ‘strong association’ that
respondents see as providing several different functions
that ‘contribute to the fabric of technology companies
in the area’. Another common theme that emerges is
the idea that firms can be more powerful acting together
rather than in isolation.
However, while many respondents cited Communitech as an important advocate and facilitator of business
community networking, there was a great deal of variation in how important or relevant firms saw Communitech to be to their particular functioning. Small firms
in the process of establishing themselves tended to find
Communitech to be more relevant than larger, more
established firms. Relationships with Communitech
change over time, and several respondents from larger,
more established firms indicated that they attended
Communitech functions more often when they were
getting established, but do so rarely now. In addition,
different size firms use Communitech for different
things. Small software firms access the networking function to learn more about the ‘how to’ of running hightech start-ups, other firms, including large ones, send
employees to the peer-to-peer groups, and yet others
belong to be ‘good citizens’ but do not find their participation to be of critical importance to their business.
Nonetheless, many firms reported that Communitech
continues to serve an important networking function
in the local business community, and though it cannot
be credited alone for the high degree of civic capital
in the region, it is clearly an important player. This
underscores the idea of interdependence of different
factors in cluster formation. As one respondent put it,
the university is the ‘driving force’ in the cluster, and

Communitech is the ‘uniting force’. The dynamic
role played by both informal networks and local civic
associations in facilitating knowledge flows in the
Waterloo ICT cluster and building civic capital underlines the importance of regional institutional structures.

CONCLUSION
Questions of location clearly remain salient in analyses
of cluster development, and the geographical proximity
between local actors and institutions continues to play
an important role in the innovation process. However,
this study of the ICT cluster in Waterloo underlines
several puzzles related to the core question of location:
if co-location with other firms is not a main driver of
local economic growth and innovation, what accounts
for the resilience or ‘stickiness’ of the cluster? This
paper argues that local economic growth in the Waterloo case is a result of the interaction between location,
institutions and a regional entrepreneurial culture.
Whereas purely locational factors, based on demanding
local customers, suppliers and competitors, cannot fully
explain the Waterloo cluster, local institutions – primarily the University of Waterloo and the Communitech business association – overlaid with regional
cultural characteristics provide the glue that attracts
and holds innovative high-tech firms to the region.
The location question: global versus local dimensions of firm
behaviour

The findings from the Waterloo ICT cluster study indicate that there is relatively little inter-firm interaction
on a business level between producers, customers and
suppliers, and very little local competition. Instead,
main customers, suppliers and competitors are global
and firms have to ‘compete locally on a global level’.
Innovation is driven primarily by global customers in
conjunction with in-house R&D departments, rather
than by local competition. In general the pattern of
innovation and the nature of inter-firm dynamics in
the cluster seem more consistent with the patterns
associated with industries that draw upon a ‘synthetic
knowledge base’ than those associated with ‘analytic
knowledge bases’ (ASHEIM and GERTLER , 2006).
With respect to the nature of local and global knowledge flows, the results conform more closely to the perspective of BATHELT et al. (2004). They argue that a
dynamic cluster requires a combination of robust and
high quality local buzz that contains actors with a
complementary variety of skills and competencies
who interact frequently, and a well-developed system
of pipelines that connects the cluster to the rest of the
world. This allows individual firms to benefit from
knowledge flows and relationships outside the cluster,

Global and Local Dimensions of the ICT Cluster in Waterloo, Canada
hypothesize that there is a relation between local buzz
and global pipelines where the more developed the
pipelines between local firms and non-local sources of
knowledge, the higher the quality of the local buzz
that benefits all firms in the cluster; ‘new and valuable
knowledge will always be created in other parts of the
world and firms who can build a pipeline to such sites
of global excellence gain competitive advantage’ (p. 21).
The Waterloo cluster appears to exhibit elements of
both a healthy local buzz and strong global pipelines.
The co-existence of a globally competitive group of
ICT firms, with the embeddedness of the University
of Waterloo and the vibrancy of the local business
association, Communitech, give ample evidence of
buzz. At the same time, it is clear that formal interfirm linkages are comparatively weak, and that key
customers and collaborators, and therefore sources of
innovation, are predominantly global – indeed most
firms see themselves as global companies – indicating
the existence of strong global pipelines. In this
respect, firms in the Waterloo ICT cluster seem to
provide evidence of both a strong local knowledge
base and effective access to international networks, but
without the presence of ‘technological gatekeepers’ to
mediate these relationships (GIULIANI, 2005). In
terms of institutional supports, there is strong evidence
that the research and training capacity of the University
of Waterloo, as well as the organizational and networking functions of Communitech, strengthened by a
strong local entrepreneurial culture, are key institutional
actors that account for a large part of the resilience or
‘stickiness’ of the Waterloo cluster.
In a similar vein, HENDRY et al. found that ‘a general
pattern emerges of firms, large and small, having a global
rather than regional (or even national) perspective
towards market opportunities and technological advances’
(2000, p. 130) and that inter-firm relations with both suppliers and customers are more externally-focused outside
the region than within it. These findings lead them to
suggest that local regional networks among firms have
low significance and therefore, that in some cases, locational
proximity may be unnecessary. In most cases, the local
market is not large enough to sustain firms, and they have
to develop and sustain a global focus in order to survive.
To help account for this, they use MIYAZAKI ’s characterization of the photonics industry according to a three level
model involving underlying generic technologies, key
components, and end-user products and systems (1995).
This analysis appears consistent with the pattern of
firm activity in the Waterloo cluster. Similar to the
photonics industry, the software industry in Waterloo
is a strategic industry with applications in many different
high-tech products and markets, and comprises different technologies that come together to create a wide
range of commercial applications. Indeed, much of
the software produced in the Waterloo region fits in
to the generic technologies or key components part
of the supply chain, and fewer end-user products and

113

systems are produced. In addition, this model pays
particular attention to relationships between firms and
supporting institutions such as universities, the labour
market, and government agencies and research
institutes, and emphasizes the importance of end
markets – customer relationships are seen as paramount. It displays many similarities with the Waterloo
case: a preponderance of global customers and emphasis
on customer relationships; lack of local networks for
doing business among firms; and the presence of key
university and other supporting institutions.
Indications that co-location with suppliers and competitors is not the primary determinant of firm behaviour in all contexts, suggests that perhaps other
variables are working in conjunction with, or more
powerfully, than co-location. To return to the central
question: if proximity between firms for transactional
purposes is not as important, what other factors
explain the resilience of the cluster? Economic geography provides the explanation that clusters form because
they act as incubators for economic activity, but these
explanations are insufficient to explain ‘differences in
innovative behaviour that is the location, functioning
and evolution of [clusters] in different regional settings’
(PILON and DEBRESSON, 2003, p. 17).
Both the theoretical literature and the results of this
study suggest that institutional and cultural factors
may provide some clues (GERTLER and WOLFE , 2002).
Institutions and social learning: the role of the universities in
cluster formation

Literature on the role of universities in the knowledgebased economy highlights two essential functions: the
performance of research and knowledge transfer and
the training of highly qualified personnel (BRAMWELL
and WOLFE , 2005). This research indicates overwhelmingly that firms value the university primarily in
terms of its contribution to a highly skilled local labour
pool. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the value of
the university to the community extends beyond its
training capacity. Regardless of whether the firms had
formal or informal ties to the university or not, respondents recognized the university as an important centre of
skills formation, R&D capacity, and tech transfer. Others
cited the international cachet that proximity to the university affords. This reflects the degree to which the university is seen to be embedded in the community. Over
time the University of Waterloo has been able to innovate in their own educational processes and academic
pursuits by reading local priorities off the networks in
which it is embedded. This again helps to sustain the
cluster and support innovation in the region.
The culture question: local associations and civic capital

Where local institutions, such as the university, help
anchor the cluster in terms of tangible and networking

114

support, local culture plays a similar role. This research
reveals a strongly articulated entrepreneurial culture in
the Waterloo region that undoubtedly contributed to
the establishment of the cluster and continues to
sustain it. The authors contend that this culture interacts
with and shapes institutional relationships and firm
structures and strategies. Far from constituting a residual
explanation, local culture is an important variable in its
own right, and Communitech is an institutional manifestation of the civic capital in the region.
Findings from this study of the ICT cluster in Waterloo echo findings from cluster studies in other regions
and economic sectors, and suggest a different conception
of what factors really matter in cluster formation and sustenance than some of the dominant theories in the literature. Concerning the relationship between local and
global forces in the development of clusters, these findings indicate that regardless of economic sector, for
many of the most successful clusters the most important
end-user markets and knowledge networks are continental or global.12 At the local level, cross-cluster research
supports these findings in the Waterloo case, and confirms that social networks at the community level are
crucial. However, where locational factors, formal
knowledge transfer, and strong ties take precedence in
other theoretical approaches, it is suggested that the
role of institutions in fostering social learning, weak ties
and cultural factors interact in such a way as to form
the basis for a successful high-tech cluster.

NOTES
1. This case study is part of a set of national case studies
recently conducted by the Innovation Systems
Research Network (ISRN) in Canada. For a more
detailed discussion of the findings of the ISRN study
on industrial clusters, see WOLFE and GERTLER (2004)
and WOLFE et al. (2005).
2. For a more detailed discussion of the nature of the innovation system in Ontario and an over view of the provincial ICT sector, cf. GERTLER and WOLFE (2004). We
have previously analysed the origins and growth of the
Waterloo ICT cluster in NELLES et al. (2005).
3. There is considerable disagreement in the literature
about what constitutes a university spin-off. Many
accounts include firms founded by university alumni
or students. One definition is ‘a commercial entity
that derives a significant portion of its commercial
activities from the application or use of a technology
and/or know-how developed by or during a university
funded research program. The new enterprise is created
either (1) to license a University invention, (2) to fund
research at the University in order to further develop
a technology/invention that will be licensed by the
company, or (3) to provide a service using Universityderived expertise’ (UNIVERSITY of ALBERTA
RESEARCH SERVICES OFFICE , 2003). Some of the
most notable spin-offs include Waterloo Maple Inc.

(1988), Open Text (1989), Virtek Vision Corp.
(1986), Dalsa (1980) and Northern Digital Inc. (1981).
Independent start-ups account for the smallest number of
new firm formation in this period, though they include
some of the region’s biggest names, such as Research in
Motion (RIM) (1987), Descartes Systems Group Inc.
(1981), Meikle Automation (1994) and Intellitech
Innovations Inc. (1989).
There is a clear difference between software and manufacturing firms in relation to sources of supply. Because
software firms do not require supplies beyond the
occasional piece of hardware, supply inputs are typically
more relevant to manufacturing firms, but in either
case, primary sources of supply tend to be located
outside the region, mainly in the USA.
Whereas the largest global firms tend to establish foreign
offices of their own (e.g. one firm has 15 –20 local offices
around the world), this is more problematic for the
smaller firms. While they know they need to provide
local support to non-local customers, setting up foreign
offices is expensive, so they tend to rely on other, more
cost-effective arrangements. One growing software
firm has a local sales representative working out of his
house in Santa Barbara in order to have a perceived
‘presence’ in California, but remarked that ‘Once the
supply relations are established nobody has any trouble
going anywhere in the world, but it’s just getting that
going’.
One interesting variation on the importance of colocation with customers is that while competing globally,
and especially in the USA, is critical to the growth of
indigenous firms, several people stressed the importance
of maintaining company headquarters and R&D capabilities in Waterloo, ‘In my growth path I did acquire
seven companies over the time I was there so I had 60
per cent of my employees outside of Canada, but what
I think was useful was that the decisions were still made
out of Waterloo. The head office was in Waterloo even
if the employees were in Munich, or Virginia, or
Austin, or San Francisco, or Chicago’.
On the other hand, some firms mentioned that there
were drawbacks to being located in Waterloo. Some
were concern that Waterloo does not have the ‘critical
mass’ to attract new talent to the region, so it is difficult
to attract certain types of highly specialized personnel.
For example, while they said it is relatively easy to
attract R&D people, it is difficult to recruit senior management, senior marketing people, senior engineers, or
people with highly specialized expertise because the
labour market is not yet thick enough for these types
of occupations. This was a key challenge cited by
many firms in the recent Tech Industry Profile of the
region (COMMUNITECH TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION,
2005).
Larger firms often have R&D units that are divided into
different functions: a long-term strategic R&D unit, a
medium-term tactical development unit that works on
commercializing product enhancements, both of which
often actively liaise with R&D institutions such as the
university, and a short-term problem-solving or ‘fixer’
unit.
Cf. NELLES et al. (2005) for a more detailed overview of
the historical antecedents of the contemporary cluster.

11. Some examples of these groups are CEO, human
resources, information technology, and product
management councils, where many firms report
sending staff to attend. Here the intention is specifically
to facilitate common problem-solving and mentoring

115

relationships, and to share management and business
practices.
