Looking Forward, Looking Backward:
From Entrepreneurial Cognition
to Neuroentrepreneurship
Norris F. Krueger, Jr. and Mellani Day

Introduction
Cognition research in entrepreneurship is currently very much en vogue – and studies have proliferated at a remarkable rate (Gregoire et al., 2009). A quick search of
Google Scholar shows a surge in studies involving entrepreneurial intentions (and
also entrepreneurial self-efficacy). Yet we also see a surge of studies on both topics
where the authors ignore excellent prior research and relatively little research that
drills down more deeply, e.g., into deeper knowledge structures.
In fact, more than a few people have noted that since the first version of this
chapter reached print in 2003, the quantity of entrepreneurial cognition research has
exploded, yet not enough progress has been made. One problem is that the very
success of existing models (e.g., intentions models usually yield a good r-squared)
has made cognition a safe, easy to adopt topic. However, what if these key models
are based upon vulnerable assumptions (Krueger et al., 2007)? Further, our models tend to be static snapshots of dynamic processes. Fortunately, the neuroscience
perspective offers both fresh theory to advance our thinking and well-honed methodologies to help us address thorny empirical problems raised by dynamic models. For
example, entrepreneurship is starting to look at cognitive developmental psychology
(Krueger, 2007, 2009b).
The intent of this chapter is threefold. First, we want to acknowledge and celebrate what entrepreneurial cognition has continued to bring to our understanding
of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Second, we want to introduce the theories
and methodologies and fresh perspectives that neuroscience has to offer the ambitious (and tenacious) entrepreneurship scholar. Finally, studying entrepreneurial
cognition is in many ways an ideal venue for neuroscientific investigation and viceversa; even Nature thought so (Lawrence et al., 2008). To these ends we will again
focus attention on what we believe to be the critical components of entrepreneurial
cognition research thus far, while adding some initial (but potent) insights from

neuroscience. While we cannot present here an exhaustive overview on all the work
done to date in entrepreneurial cognition, we have identified that with the greatest
potential impact.

Overview
If the “heart” of entrepreneurship is an orientation toward seeing opportunities (e.g.,
Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990), then from whence do perceptions of opportunity derive?
Understanding entrepreneurial cognition is imperative to understanding the essence
of entrepreneurship, how it emerges and how it evolves. This is especially true if
we wish to move from descriptive research to theory-driven research. This chapter offers researchers an overview of the cognitive processes that drive “thinking
entrepreneurially”:
• What is the nature of entrepreneurial thinking?
• What cognitive phenomena are associated with seeing and acting on
opportunities?
Cognition research offers ways to bring the entrepreneur back into entrepreneurship and offers us multiple theory-driven and empirically robust mechanisms, to
build a deeper, richer understanding of how we learn to see opportunities. Cognitive
phenomena are important throughout this process: Opportunities themselves are perceived, if not enacted, as are the critical antecedents of opportunity perceptions.
Entrepreneurial activity may require a tangible infrastructure of needed resources
but we neglect at our peril what we might dub the cognitive infrastructure). What
enables us to perceive (and learn to perceive) personally credible opportunities.
Understanding the cognitive infrastructure undergirding entrepreneurial activity
also affords us richer perspectives on how to nurture entrepreneurship (Krueger,
2000, 2007; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; Shepherd &
Krueger, 2002).
If we are to better understand the entrepreneurial process, then we need to better understand how opportunities manifest themselves as credible (Shapero, 1975,
1982, 1985). As with other nascent fields, entrepreneurship studies have long had a
bias toward descriptive research, grounded more in practical concerns than in theory. The cry for “more strong theory in entrepreneurship research” continues to be
a clarion call that still has not been heeded as enthusiastically as it should. One
reason for this has been the tendency to use theory to explain one’s findings retrospectively, rather than identifying a useful, appropriate theoretical base from which
to work prospectively. However, this is changing.
For example, early on the field featured considerable research into “budding”
entrepreneurs, a vague definition. Today researchers talk about “entrepreneurial
intentions,” a more rigorous (and theory-based) focus. Similarly, most of the
research on “opportunity recognition” remains highly descriptive, yet we see
increasing use of theory to drive the empirical research, not just finding theory to

<-----Page 2----->13

explain the findings. The potential for continued progress lies not just in cognitive
theory, but cognition research offers more than its fair share of potential for exciting,
productive future research in entrepreneurship.
We are thus asking, “When someone is thinking ‘entrepreneurially,’ what does
that mean in terms of cognitive processes?” As Robert Baron argues persuasively,
we all share the same basic cognitive processes but entrepreneurs appear to face
unique role demands that are accompanied by differences in the cognitive processes
those role demands require.
We focus on the most critical distinction between entrepreneur and nonentrepreneur, the intentional pursuit of opportunity. As Stevenson pointed out long
ago, the “heart” of entrepreneurship is the seeking of and acting on opportunities. As
Shane (2003) echoed from Shapero, we must also focus on the nexus of entrepreneur
and opportunity. To understand entrepreneurship then requires an understanding of
how we learn to see opportunities and decide to pursue them. And that requires
increasingly sophisticated theory and methods. Cognition research offers rich theory and well-developed if underutilized methods. As readers will see, it also offers
considerable successes to encourage the entrepreneurship researcher. The study of
human cognition has surfaced a remarkable variety of theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding how human beings apprehend data and process it.
The rich variety of approaches can offer an equally rich variety of insights.
For example, entrepreneurs appear to identify opportunities based on cues or
signals from the environment that they filter and process through a number of mechanisms (e.g., intentions). Cognitive psychologists would point out that entrepreneurs
would likely recognize useful patterns in the myriad cues and signals we receive,
patterns that suggest potential opportunities or not (Baron & Ensley, 2006). Shapero
used the analogy of “antennae” – we all have our antennae tuned to certain “frequencies” and “directions.” Entrepreneurs are no different, except in what directions,
etc., their antennae are tuned. However, researching pattern recognition is not terribly simple; it requires understanding the theories behind human pattern recognition
and it requires understanding the rigorous methodologies needed to research in this
arena. Another way to look at cognition research is Herbert Simon’s three levels of
cognitive phenomena (1963): Semantic (surface) level, Symbolic (deep structures)
level, and Neurological (biological) level (Fig. 13.1 below).

Fig. 13.1 Simon’s (1963/1997) three levels of analysis

However, the very breadth and richness of cognitive science also reflects a heterogeneous field. As such, we focus here on selected topic areas that seem the most
promising and offer the most fertile ground for future entrepreneurship research.
Researchers face an interesting paradox: “How do entrepreneurs think?” is a very
important, oft-asked question yet we have only rarely confronted it directly and
with rigor. On the one hand, understanding the nature of entrepreneurial thinking is
central to understanding both entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Thus, we need to
understand how we learn to see actionable opportunities. Terms such as “thinking,”,
“perception,” and “intent” suggest that cognitive psychology should naturally offer
invaluable insights. But, on the other hand, research into this question has taken
many different forms, using many different approaches, often ad hoc descriptive
analyses (again, which needlessly fail to incorporate a true theoretical grounding.)
As such, this chapter will emphasize existing research on entrepreneurial thinking that is founded on well-received theory from cognitive psychology, especially
social cognitive psychology. However, the reader is warned that the disparate, eclectic streams of research into entrepreneurial thinking are not as well connected as
one might prefer nor even as one might reasonably expect. Yet, this eclecticism can
also be viewed as a far-from-complete “mosaic tile” where the quality “tiles” are
building toward a more comprehensive picture. Again, the key is research based on
theory a priori, not simply digging up theory to explain what might be a post hoc
and spurious finding. The good news is that scholars such as Baron (1998, 2000a),
Mitchell et al. (2000, 2002), and others (e.g., Gaglio, 1997; Gaglio & Katz, 2001;
Shepherd & Douglas, 1997) have shown us that entrepreneurial cognition is incredibly fertile ground for important and interesting research – if done rigorously and
with thorough grasp of theory (Gregoire et al., 2009).
Obviously, if the “heart” of entrepreneurship is this orientation toward seeking opportunities, developing a much deeper understanding of this cuts to the very
essence of entrepreneurship. If we understand how we learn to see opportunities, we
unlock much of the heretofore “black box” of entrepreneurship. Some of the most
promising recent models of entrepreneurship focus on cognitive processes, showing the importance of an opportunity-friendly cognitive infrastructure (Alvarez &
Busenitz, 2001; Krueger, 2007; Mitchell et al., 2000, 2002).
Yet even that may not offer us the most valuable payoff. If we understand the cognitive processes associated with entrepreneurial thinking and action then we have at
least a tentative blueprint for influencing those processes. As with much research in
cognitive psychology, there will be as many testable implications for teaching and
for practice as there are testable implications for research.
Before taking entrepreneurial action a perceived opportunity must arise, e.g., via
creativity (Section “Perceptions, Antecedents and Consequences”) and intentions
toward pursuing that opportunity (Section “Current Thinking about Entrepreneurial
Intentions”). Intentions are driven by critical attitudes and beliefs such as selfefficacy (Section “Self-Efficacy Beliefs: Critical Correlate of Intent”) and underneath those beliefs and attitudes are deeper structures that reflect how we structure knowledge representations. These deeper structures help inform us about
how to nurture entrepreneurial thinking (Section “Implications for Entrepreneurial

<-----Page 4----->13

325

Learning (and Education)”). We then look at some interesting domains where we
can apply our analysis, e.g., social entrepreneurship (Section “Context Matters:
Entrepreneurial Environments”) before concluding. Let us preview these subdomains of greatest interest.
1. Perception and Creativity: One critically important contribution that cognitive science offers the entrepreneurship researcher is that people apprehend reality
through multiple perceptual lenses. Our brains grasp external phenomena though
processes of perception. We are unlikely to pursue an opportunity that we do not
perceive. What do we notice? How do we interpret what we do notice? What might
bias our perceptions?
2. Intention: In cognitive psychology, intention is the cognitive state immediately prior to executing a behavior. The dominant class of formal intentions models
employs two critical antecedents of intentions that can be classified (despite varying terminology) as (a) perceived feasibility and (b) perceived desirability. That
is, intentions require the belief that the behavior is feasible and the belief that
the behavior is desirable. However, we will see that our modeling needs serious
revisiting.
3. Key Beliefs and Attitudes – Self-efficacy: If intentions depend on personal beliefs and attitudes, then researchers interested in entrepreneurial thinking
should also explore the antecedents of intentions. In particular, we have seen a
groundswell of interest in one key belief that has long been associated with initiating and persisting at goal-directed behavior: Bandura’s notion of perceived
self-efficacy.
4. Deeper Beliefs and Knowledge Structures: Cognitive phenomena such as
intentions lie relatively close to the surface in the architecture of our thinking.
Underneath these surface structures are deeper cognitive structures of how we represent knowledge and how it all fits together. Cognitive science has long used methods
such as causal maps, schemas, and scripts to illuminate these deeper structures.
While this is perhaps the newest domain of cognition research to be applied to
entrepreneurship, the potential is immense. Not only do researchers receive a more
fundamental view of how we learn to think entrepreneurially, this more fundamental
look affords us new ways to influence the processes that lie beneath entrepreneurial
thinking. That means we have new, more powerful mechanisms by which we can
enhance entrepreneurial thinking.
5. Entrepreneurial Learning: Entrepreneurship educators such as Ron Mitchell
and others focus entrepreneurship training on changing students’ entrepreneurial
scripts from relatively novice to relatively expert making this arena a most exciting and most fertile ground for entrepreneurship scholars. One crucial impact of
cognition-focused research into entrepreneurship is that if we understand the “why”
of entrepreneurial thinking, we can influence the “how.” That is, we can use the
fruits of this research fairly directly in our teaching and training. The descriptive
work done in entrepreneurship education has, of course, proven of great benefit but
the next step for researchers is, as with intentions, to be much better grounded in theory and Section “Implications for Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)” lays
some useful groundwork for exploring how entrepreneurs learn.

Context Matters: Productive Domains for Entrepreneurial Cognition: Here
we briefly examine several key research domains where entrepreneurial cognition research has been productive or shows clear potential for new insights. These
include entrepreneurial communities and organizations, family business and social
and sustainable entrepreneurship. More important, we see this as a potent arena for
building our research agenda and in developing intelligent, informed prescriptions
for public policy.

Caveat? Cross-disciplinary Definitional Issues
First, however, we need to address some issues raised by crossing disciplinary
boundaries. To pursue the kinds of entrepreneurial cognition research we discuss
here will likely involve great care in how we pursue them. Clarifying definitions
is critical, so too is building adept cross-disciplinary research teams. In crossdisciplinary research efforts common specification of terminology and constructs
becomes more important than ever. Over time as research silos develop the same
terminology may be used in completely different ways and the same ideas and
constructs may have different labels (e.g., the constructs: risk, uncertainty, ambiguity). Miller et al. (2008) refer to this as an epistemological pluralism that can
actually enhance knowledge by providing a many-sided view perhaps and lead to
a more successful integrated study. Further, the team approach brings experts from
various disciplines together with limits of cross-disciplinary knowledge requiring
a significant level of methodological respect (O’Cathain et al., 2008), trust, and
cooperation.
In the academic realm this must be a very intentional process, since by default
it is expected that academics become experts in the fields they are studying, and be
able to stand behind any work published with confidence. As knowledge advances
however (and it is no different in working to combine the realms of neuroscience,
cognitive psychology and entrepreneurship), there is much additional learning and
knowledge that must be gained to have such confidence. The academic could choose
to take decades and study each discipline and eventually know enough to do a solo
cross-disciplinary work. Or the academic can choose to partner with experts from
other disciplines and work together to advance the research agenda. However, it
is difficult enough to work with other academics within the same discipline. Is it
easier or harder to work with those of unfamiliar disciplines? This can also create
a dilemma for the journal editor. Cross-disciplinary research teams would seem to
call for cross-disciplinary editorial review boards (Rotfeld, 2009).
Importance of Technical Competence: Entrepreneurship and cognition experts
are certainly confronted with this dilemma when desiring to incorporate
neuroscience-based methods. The past few decades have seen great strides in development of new instrumentation in the medical field and correspondingly the use of
these devices in fields such as neuroeconomics. There is much to learn about the
technical aspects of setting up experiments, sourcing equipment and technicians,

<-----Page 6----->13

327

understanding software, and reading and interpreting results that accompany this
type of research but this is indeed a new frontier (Krueger & Welpe, 2007).
Some of these research elements may be incorporated by every researcher in the
social sciences as a matter of course (e.g., what does the literature say about
the brain-based correlates of the particular area of study), others will require
cross-disciplinary teams trust, respect, and cooperation when using brain-based
experimental approaches to test theories.

Perceptions, Antecedents and Consequences
If perception is central to understanding how we apprehend opportunities, then it is
imperative that we understand perception (Douglas, 2009). Here, neuroscience has
much to offer us. It also helps us to better understand mechanisms that facilitate or
inhibit opportunity-related perceptions such as creativity.
Similar to studying black holes in space, brain-based research reveals that the
subconscious is present and influential; however, it cannot be directly observed or
measured (Blair, 2010). It is proposed here that the interface of cognition might be
thought of as three somewhat fluid junctures of temporal, neurological space: (1)
starting with “oblivious” where the subconscious may be working on it but the conscious has not perceived it also known as pre-cognition (Aimar, 2008; Hayek, 1952;
Libet, 2004 [1999]); (2) to para-cognition (there is something nagging, on the tip
of the tongue, at the edge of consciousness, you have almost got it); (3) to perception or recognition (aha!) (Haynie & Shepherd, 2007; Schraw & Dennison, 1994).
Further, there is a feedback loop that sends messages back to the subconscious for
recycling and revision (Balzer et al., 1989) (Fig. 13.2).

Fig. 13.2 The three junctures of temporal, neurological space

Metacognition is the ability to reflect upon, understand, and control one’s learning to formulate strategies for processing a changing reality (Schraw & Dennison,
1994). After the cycle from pre-cognition to recognition which can be in an instant
or perhaps take months, capabilities for metacognition play a role. Finally, cognitive feedback “serves to aid the decision-maker in appropriately interpreting how the
decision criteria relevant to a given task relate to each other holistically in the context
of the decision outcome” (Balzer et al., 1989). How does this explain the thought
processes of entrepreneurs? Are there differences in the way the entrepreneurial

<-----Page 7----->328

brain works as versus the non-entrepreneurial brain at each of these cognitive junctures? We propose these hidden cognitive processes contribute to the difficulty in
entrepreneurship research in identifying how opportunities are recognized and offer
fertile ground for new thinking and research.

Before the Entrepreneur – An Entrepreneurial Mindset
and Complex Thinking
Hayek (1952) defines mind as “a particular order of a set of events taking place
in some organism and in some manner related to but not identical with, the physical order of events in the environment” (Horwitz, 2005). Koppl and Minniti (2003)
briefly discuss some approaches to a theory of mind as related to entrepreneurial
learning and knowledge structures though stop short of addressing biological interactions. Aimar (2008) analyzes the classic Austrian economists’ efforts to isolate
and understand tacit and conscious knowledge and the difference between the
preconscious (Hayek, 1952) and the conscious. McGrath and MacMillan (2000)
portrayed the entrepreneurial mindset as a dynamic decision process that is central
to success in an entrepreneurial environment. Ireland, Hitt, and Simon (2003) further developed the concept of entrepreneurial mindset and the necessary cognitive
tasks as:
• Making sense of opportunities in the context of changing goals;
• Constantly questioning one’s “dominant logic” in the context of a changing
environment; and
• Revisiting “deceptively simple” questions about what we think to be true about
the markets and the firm.
Cognitive adaptability “captures some of the cognitive underpinnings of the
entrepreneurial mindset” and proposes that it can be enhanced through the development of metacognition (Haynie & Shepherd, 2007). Psychologists use the term
“executive system” to identify that part of the brain responsible for handling novelties with which it is confronted. Related to the C system (reflective system) as
identified by neuroeconomists (Lieberman et al., 2002) it may function at the preand para-cognition levels for sense-making.
Miller and Cohen (2001) discuss how the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) is thought to
participate in cognitive control in that it maintains “patterns of activity that represent
goals and the means to achieve them.” These patterns “provide bias signals throughout much of the rest of the brain, affecting not only visual processes but also other
sensory modalities, as well as systems responsible for response execution, memory
retrieval, emotional evaluation, etc.” The example used is at the train station waiting to meet a friend who will be wearing a red coat. The brain filters and sees red
in an effort to find the right red and find the friend. This is at the recognition level
where the brain knows for what it is searching. Is there similar functioning at the

<-----Page 8----->13

329

pre- and para-cognition levels? Shane (2003) argues that entrepreneurship uses a
qualitatively different decision-making process for example, than that used in standard marketplace transactions (Krueger & Day, 2009). Pech and Cameron (2006)
argue that information becomes the catalyst for entrepreneurial behavior but “only
because the entrepreneur is actively searching for opportunities with potential.”
However, in problem-solving for entrepreneurship ideas have come from complex
intentional structured searches as well as the “aha” moment in the middle of the
night. In both cases (the structured or the “aha” moment) the entrepreneurial idea
can be either accidental, that is, something was discovered or uncovered that was
totally unexpected leading to a new direction, or it can be a new solution (combination) enacted in answer to a specific problem that has already been identified.
A theory of mind of the entrepreneur may be developed where social neuroscience
(Cacioppo & Berntson, 1992) which focuses on brain-based underpinnings of social
behavior of the entrepreneur, intersects with cognitive neuroscience which seeks to
understand the neural substrates of mental processes and resulting entrepreneurial
behavior of an individual.

Complex Thinking
“[T]he degree of complexity of the human mind is logically greater than the complexity of consciousness” (Aimar, 2008). As we suspected, there is much more
going on in our brains than that of which we are conscious; there is “more than
one set of cognitive structures that reflects the expert mindset, and it is also likely
that there is more than one configuration of developmental experiences to get there”
(Krueger, 2009a). We can argue that opportunity identification often reflects relatively sophisticated skills at counterfactual thinking (Gaglio, 2004) and an expert
mindset (Krueger, 2008). Those “who access metacognitive processes are more
adaptable given dynamic and uncertain contexts” (Earley & Ang, 2003; Haynie &
Shepherd, 2007). Could it be, therefore, that the capability for complex thought is a
prerequisite for entrepreneurship?

A New Look at Individual Differences?
It is anecdotally easy to perceive that entrepreneurs are somehow “different” at a
trait level but very few rigorous studies found any such differences (De Carolis
& Saparito, 2006; Shaver & Scott, 1991). What if the classic trait studies in
entrepreneurship had little success because they measured the symptoms if you
will, rather than the source of entrepreneurial behavior? Could the source of
entrepreneurial behavior be deeper, somewhere in our neurology, reflected in the
feedback (and forward) process of the “three junctures of temporal, neurological
cognitive space?” Is there a genetic covariance associated with entrepreneurship

<-----Page 9----->330

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

(Johnson, 2009; Nicolaou & Shane, 2009)? Are there strong “hard-wired” differences in metacognitive awareness (Haynie & Shepherd, 2007)? Han and Northoff
(2008) recently showed how we can tease out nature and nurture through comparing
cultural differences to differences in neural substrates.
Stanton and Welpe (2010) build on an emerging body of research in neuroeconomics on risk, uncertainty, and ambiguity and apply its findings to entrepreneurship
with important implications. It has been found that different parts of the brain
engage (light up, if you will) when under conditions of risk versus conditions of
uncertainty. This finding alone can give us clues as to what is going on in the brain
and specifically for our case the entrepreneurial brain in, for example, the recognition and exploitation of opportunities under these conditions. It provides another
foundational pillar for theory-building and theory-testing in a variety of branches,
showing, for example, that there are deep subconscious drivers of entrepreneurial
behavior that when identified might lead to insights into previously inexplicable
behavior and decisions.
The study of attitudes, self-efficacy, complex thinking skill, role identity
(Krueger, 2008; Shaver & Scott, 1991), biases (existing, learned sense-making
mechanisms, Haynie & Shepherd, 2007), emotions, heuristics (Pech & Cameron,
2006), and “metacognitive awareness” deserves another examination in light
of neuroscience and genetics research methodologies that allow a deeper look.
Consider, for example, gender-based studies that have begun to surface some
tantalizing hints of consistent differences (e.g., Holmquist & Carter, 2009) that
we may be able to link to neurological differences such as differences in oxytocin
levels (Stanton et al., 2008).

Creativity
Let us now consider that opportunity recognition is very much a creative process (Hansen et al., 2006) and creativity is another domain where we can see the
impact of brain-based science. It has been shown that social diversity and creativity
have a positive relationship with new firm formation (Lee, Florida & Acs, 2004).
Yet while there has been interest in the potential connection between creativity
and entrepreneurship (e.g., Gilad, 1984; Whiting, 1988), studies of creativity and
entrepreneurship have primarily examined the differences in entrepreneurial thought
processes within creative industries, generally in micro-businesses (Colas, 2005;
Poettschacher, 2005) and distinctive approaches to creative entrepreneurship in the
management of and achieving goals for a particular business (Davies, 2005; Rae,
2005). Fewer studies have sought to explore creativity and the formation of new
ventures directly.
Nyström (1993) defines creativity as the balanced unfolding and converging of
experience, visioning and creating the future. In the creative process, Ward (2004)
argues that “[c]reative ideas do not appear, ex nihilo, full-blown in the minds of
their originators, but rather must be crafted from the person’s existing knowledge.”

<-----Page 10----->13

Looking Forward, Looking Backward

331

He asks: “if new ideas are rooted in old ones, how does novelty emerge?” Rather
than throwing out everything they know and starting fresh, in the creative process entrepreneurs build upon that deep, embedded, tacit knowledge and then use
conceptual combination, analogical reasoning, and abstraction methods to apply
it creatively to find novel and useful ideas to exploit in the marketplace (e.g., the
process involved in the three junctures of cognitive space with feedback loop).
Further, Ward notes that “[b]y distinguishing between processes associated with
initial problem formulation and subsequent procedures, such models draw attention
to that fact that creativity may be more than just problem solving” (Ward, 2004).
This is reminiscent of Shane’s argument that too often entrepreneurship research
studies measure the precondition [pre-entrepreneurial decision processes (pre-stage)
including cognition and affective influences (cf. Shane, 2000, 2003)] and the reaction to those preconditions (valuation then decision to exploit) as combined events,
rather than separating these as very distinct processes. Dunham and Venkataraman
(2006) propose that the human ability to act creatively has been poorly served by
approaches that only consider rational choice. They go so far as to state that “we
will not be able to develop compelling explanations of entrepreneurial activity until
we make a fundamental adjustment to our underlying assumptions of human action.
We suggest replacing our reliance upon a rational actor model of human behavior with a model that accommodates actors’ abilities to act creatively.” This is an
area that demands much further investigation and the application of biological- and
neurological-based methods could provide great insights to these processes.

Economic Depression, Psychological Depression, and Creativity
Kets de Vries (1996) famously argues that psychological negatives can drive
positive entrepreneurial behaviors. In entrepreneurship research there have been
some studies tying economic depression in a given economy to increased
entrepreneurial activity (see, for example, Boyd, 2005; Pietrobelli et al., 2004; Yusuf
& Schindehutte, 2000). In these studies, job loss is a measurable explanatory factor
effecting new venture formation. However, there is typically no connection made at
the individual level between job loss and any corresponding psychological depression; that is presumably left to the field of psychology. Anecdotally, it is a shock
when one loses one’s employment and it is not a stretch to make such a connection.
However, a link between artistic creativity to psychological depression and other
affective disorders has indeed been established (Akinola & Mendes, 2008). Does
artistic creativity follow the same processes as entrepreneurial creativity? Or are
these distinct types with processes carried out in separate areas of the brain?
Akinola and Mendes (2008) carried out an experimental study of affective
vulnerability comparing baseline and post-treatment measures of levels of an
adrenal steroid, DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) that has been linked
to depression. They found the highest levels of artistic creativity in participants
that presented with the lowest baseline levels of DHEAS. It would be interesting

<-----Page 11----->332

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

to undergo a similar study comparing entrepreneurial creativity under varying
conditions linked with depression. Perhaps even short periods of intensive negative emotions resulting from depression can result in great bursts of entrepreneurial
creativity. Correspondingly, could there be any portion of increased entrepreneurial
activity that might be explained by psychological depression or, like artists, the
entrepreneurs’ coping mechanism?

Current Thinking about Entrepreneurial Intentions
If we care about how entrepreneurs emerge, then it cannot be too surprising to see
the extent of interest in critical preconditions that facilitate or inhibit this emergence
(Davidsson, 1991; Krueger, 1993, 2000; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; McMullen
et al., 2007; Levie & Autio, 2008; Shapero, 1975, 1985). Entrepreneurship scholars
once used terms such as “budding entrepreneurs” but adoption of the more specific term, “intentions” had added focus (and thus more rigor) to this fascinating
research area. In return, this is an arena where entrepreneurs can perhaps “give
back” fruitfully to other disciplines. For example, it is increasingly evident that
simplistic modeling may yield a sizable r-squared but are we really understanding
causation?
Is it not reasonable to consider that critical entrepreneurial behaviors are at least
partly voluntary? Philosophers (we recommend Bratman, 1987) argue persuasively
that intentions are central to voluntary human behavior. Indeed, psychologists and
philosophers alike define “intention” as a cognitive state temporally and causally
prior to the target behavior. That is, intent is the cognitive state immediately prior
to the decision to act. Empirically, intentions are consistently the single best predictor of subsequent behavior (even if the predictive power is underwhelming.) Why?
Conventional wisdom says that any planned behavior is intentional. Essentially, if
a behavior does not result from stimulus-response, it is intentional. Or is it? It is
certainly not that simple.
When is “intent” intent? Consider the classic work of Benjamin Libet et al.
(1983) where experimenters can often detect human intent in advance, suggesting a neurological antecedent to intent and behavior. In turn, that opens the door
for us to ask some new questions as well as shedding light on some older ones
(such as the antecedents of entrepreneurial intent.) After wiring up the subjects the
experimenter asks them to raise either hand. Before subjects are aware of it themselves the experimenter can quickly discern which hand each subject will raise.
Next, the experimenter induces the subject to raise either the left or right hand. The
subject perceives the completely induced choice as free will. A neuroscientist can
see our intentions before we perceive we have formulated them. The implication: we
may perceive intent toward a discrete behavior even where it is completely illusory.
What does this mean for our models and measures of entrepreneurial intentions
that we have carefully developed from proven theory and refined through rigorous empirical analysis? What does this say about all our other carefully considered

cognitive phenomena in entrepreneurship? It bids us to be cautious in our methods
and rigorous in our theories but it also tells us of the great potential for future
research.
If we are interested in studying new ventures, then we need to understand the
processes that lead up to their initiation. From a cognition perspective, that entails a
better understanding of the intent to initiate entrepreneurial activity and the reasons
driving them (Shaver, 2007). Psychologists have long found intentions to be highly
useful in understanding behavior. Also, an increased focus on intentions pushes
researchers away from more retrospective research designs toward more prospective designs. It allows a greater emphasis on predicting versus explaining. However,
it is not entirely clear that is what we are seeing empirically.
We seem to be blessed with theoretically sound, empirically robust formal models of human intentions toward a target behavior that appear to converge on highly
similar sets of critical antecedents to intentions (e.g., Bagozzi and Warshaw, 1990).
The breadth and depth of research on entrepreneurial intentions is well-documented
elsewhere (e.g., Gregoire et al., 2009; Krueger, 2009b) but let us concisely recap its
evolution.

Theory of Reasoned Action, Theory of Planned Behavior,
and Shapero’s Model of the Entrepreneurial Event
Ajzen and Fishbein’s Theory of Reasoned Action and Ajzen’s Theory of Planned
Behavior (TPB) surfaced as the dominant class of intentions while, interestingly, the
domain of entrepreneurship already provided a model quite similar to TPB presaging Ajzen’s TPB by several years., Shapero (1975, 1982) proposed the following, the
“entrepreneurial event” (initiating entrepreneurial behavior) depends on the presence of a salient, personally credible opportunity. Homologous to Azjen, a credible
opportunity depends on two critical antecedents: perceptions of desirability (both
personal and social) and perceptions of feasibility plus the useful concept of the
“precipitating event,” something that would “displace” the decision maker from the
inertia of existing behavior and drive the decision-maker to reconsider her/his opportunity set which might now have entrepreneurship as a salient and most credible
personal opportunity.
First tested in the entrepreneurship domain was Shapero’s model where it found
considerable support (Krueger, 1993a). Subsequently, Krueger and Carsrud (1993)
proposed consideration of Ajzen’s TPB (Carsrud & Krueger, 1996). Others, especially Kolvereid (1996; Iakovleva & Kolvereid, 2009), have found great success
in adapting TPB to entrepreneurial samples. This ultimately spawned a comparative test of TPB and SEE, finding support for both models (Krueger et al., 2000).
Post hoc analysis suggested that the optimal model would include propensity to act
from SEE and social norms from TPB (see Fig. 13.3). Both Ajzen and Shapero provide us a theory-driven and empirically robust model at the surface level (Simon’s
“semantic” level). However, theory and methods from cognition research offer us
the opportunity to dig deeper into the underlying cognitive structures (Simon’s
“symbolic” level).

Fig. 13.3 Intentions model (Krueger, 2000; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; Krueger et al., 2000;
Shapero, 1982)

If the field of entrepreneurship has now experienced a “boom market” in
entrepreneurial intentions, in some cases, research has ignored much of the key
literature (and some have ignored almost all of it). However, it does appear that the
strengths of the formal intentions model have led scholars to use it with great confidence and perhaps too little critical thinking. As Libet’s findings show, chinks in
the model’s armor are growing.

Disadvantages of Intentions Models
First, intentions can change, especially for relatively distal or complex behaviors.
As such, the intent to start a business is far from persistent. However, this generates
a golden opportunity for researchers to study the changes in entrepreneurial intentions. Changing intentions is relatively unexplored in any domain; the entrepreneurship domain should prove especially useful in explicating the underpinnings of
changing intentions.
Direction of Causality? Next, there is still debate over the direction of causality. In particular, intentions can be seen as simply another attitude, just more visible.
Robinson et al. (1991) argued for Allport’s (1935) approach where behavior depends
on a troika of critical attitudes: Affective, cognitive, and conative [intent], even
developing a much-underused measure of entrepreneurial attitudes.
More recently, work by Brännback et al. (2006) and Krueger and Kickul (2006)
both stumbled across an unusual finding. While perceived desirability and perceived
feasibility were significant antecedents of intentions, as expected, a rudimentary test
found that desirability and intent also clearly predicted feasibility and that feasibility
and intent clearly predicted desirability – almost equally. In fact, the Brännback
et al.’s (2007) data seems to suggest that feasibility may prove – statistically – to be
the dependent variable.

Dynamic Process, Static Snapshot? What if the intentions model as a dynamic
formulation exhibits feedback loops? If we can convert the intentions model into
a model of changing intentions, we can readily present strong theory for intentions influencing its “predictors.” Also, we know relatively little about the temporal
dimension, thus we can explore intentions toward when a prospective entrepreneur
might undertake an intended venture through the enactment of temporal issues
(Bird, 1992; Fischer et al., 1997; West & Meyer, 1997).

Dynamic Modeling of Intent: Implementation Intentions
Gollwitzer (Gollwitzer & Brandstatter, 1997; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) and
others have gone beyond intentions toward a goal and investigated intentions toward
implementation. Strong intentions toward implementing an intended strategy may
play a more significant role than we might think and often entail different dynamics
than intentions toward the goal per se. That is, goal intent is not enough; a strong
intent to implement may well represent a very different set of mental models much
as Bratman (1987) argued that intent is not really a genuine intention without a
significant level of commitment to that intended goal or behavior. Little research
has looked explicitly at implementation intentions in entrepreneurial settings,
although studies are currently underway (see Elfving et al., 2009, for supportive
initial evidence).

Dynamic Modeling of Intent: Bagozzi’s Theory of Trying
Figure 13.4 depicts one highly promising vehicle for embracing these specific
dynamics in Bagozzi’s Theory of Trying (ToT; Bagozzi & Warshaw, 1990; Bagozzi
et al., 2003; Dholakia & Bagozzi, 2002). The parsimony (and seeming explanatory robustness) of the Theory of Planned Behavior allowed TPB to predominate
intentions research. However, Ajzen’s model presumes that the target behavior be
under volitional control. That is, it assumes no particular barrier thus it does not
actually lend it itself to addressing intentions toward a goal (under partial volitional
control; simply put, something that requires trying to achieve). Moreover, part of
the complexity of using ToT lies in explicit consideration of emotional reasoning.
“Hot” cognitions are, however, necessary to consider in dynamic models of human
cognition (Fig. 13.4).
Consider Bagozzi’s most recent version, his theory of effortful decision-making
(Bagozzi et al., 2003) in Fig. 13.4. Note that this variation on the Theory of Trying
explicitly includes two phases of the decision process, goal intent, and implementation intent. But also note that rather than taking a simple snapshot of attitudes
relating to the intent, the model explicitly considers the cognitive and emotive
appraisal processes that we observe in any significant human decision-making.

<-----Page 15----->336

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

Fig. 13.4 Theory of effortful decision making (Bagozzi et al., 2003; Carsrud & Brännback, 2009)

In this case, we know that entrepreneurs engage in such appraisal and this has
become an important research area of its own (e.g., Michl et al., 2009).
To put another way, the Theory of Trying captures that the process of how
entrepreneurial intentions evolve entails hot cognitions not just cold cognition. Note
the following experiment where serial entrepreneurs are compared to successful
managers by Cambridge University’s neuroscience experts in Barbara Sahakian’s
lab (Lawrence et al., 2008). On tests of pure “cold” cognition, they did not differ, but
on “hot” cognitions (where emotions are closely engaged in decisions) the successful entrepreneurs clearly outperformed the managers. Successful entrepreneurial
thinking appears to require expert management of both rational and emotional reasoning. Not terribly surprising to most entrepreneurs, but these insights surfaced
much faster because Sahakian’s team had an advantage in theory and methodology.
Please note that this was good neuroscience but there was no need for expensive
tools like the fMRI, only good theory and skillful experimentation. Of course, as
we get better at using neuroscience, we will find the use of tools such as MRI,
fMRI, etc., to be essential. What is important is to see that “neuro-entrepreneurship”
is ready to join neuroeconomics, neuromarketing, neurofinance (and even neuroethics) as a productive field of study (Stanton et al., 2008, Krueger & Day,
2009).

337

Possible Evidence for Phase Changes?
If effortful decision-making changes qualitatively as intentions emerge, evolve, and
coalesce into commitment and action, then it seems very likely that the intentional
mindset changes qualitatively across the process. For a simple example, consider
nascent entrepreneurs (i.e., those farther along than merely potential but not yet fully
launched). Their launch is underway, but not yet completed, so they are still facing
numerous complex decisions about future intentional behaviors. Of course, even
a long-established entrepreneur faces many complex decisions but entrepreneurial
nascency may impose a somewhat more structured set of issues. Research based on
the rich data sets from the Panel Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) is
well underway and one must suspect that we will find some intriguing results – and
not a few surprises. We will revisit this issue in the section below on entrepreneurial
deep beliefs.

Passion, Affect, and Emotions
Is it possible to discuss entrepreneurs without discussing entrepreneurial passion
(Cardon et al., 2009)? Whether scholar, educator, or public stereotype, we associate
entrepreneurial activity with highly salient emotional engagement (and commitment?). Emotional (and rational) cognitive appraisal in entrepreneurs is another
research area of immense promise (we recommend insights from Isabelle Welpe
and colleagues, e.g., Michl et al., 2009). Any discussion of entrepreneurial thinking, including entrepreneurial intentions, requires careful, rigorous attention to the
important aspects of how our decision-making is thoroughly intertwined with rational and emotional appraisal. Parallel to this, Baron (2008) recently mapped the
remarkable breadth and depth of research issues touching upon entrepreneurial
affect.
To study “hot” cognition in entrepreneurs requires careful experimental design
(Krueger & Welpe, 2007) but that is already proving invaluable, especially in settings that unavoidably engage strong emotion such as failure (Shepherd et al., 2009)
or fear of failure (Klaukien & Patzelt, 2009). Preliminary evidence suggests that
leadership’s management of subordinate affect has a direct effect on entrepreneurial
creativity (e.g., Kollman & Lomberg, 2009). Other recent experimental research
has looked at differentiating how potential entrepreneurs appraise opportunities
rationally and emotionally (Krueger & Welpe, 2008; Krueger et al., 2009). That
is, the cognitive and emotional appraisal of opportunity identification, evaluation,
and exploitation differs for the social dimension of an intended opportunity from
the appraisal of the economic dimension. The economic dimension appears to
engage primarily rational (“cold”) cognition while appraisal of the social dimension appears to engage both (“hot” cognition) which is useful in understanding the
role of entrepreneurial passion (Krueger et al., 2009). The next step will be to begin
delving more deeply into the key beliefs that anchor appraisal.

<-----Page 17----->338

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

Non-Compensatory Decision-Making in Evoked Opportunity Sets
Why are anchoring beliefs important? Important human decisions are inherently
complex. In purely compensatory decision-making, there are always tradeoffs, but in
non-compensatory (or lexicographic) decisions, there will be non-negotiable decision criteria. Human decisions that involve multiple criteria almost always include
at least one non-compensatory attribute (which neuromarketing argues is often
far from obvious). Recent work by Krueger, Kickul, Gundry, and Verma (2006)
examined the key attributes of intended ventures and found clear evidence for intentions reflecting significant lexicographic (non-compensatory) preferences. If human
decision-making – such as decisions relating to the intent toward launching a venture – is a mix of compensatory and non-compensatory decision criteria, our linear
additive models may leave much useful information unaddressed.

Self-Efficacy Beliefs: Critical Correlate of Intent
If underneath the intentionality of opportunity (and thus entrepreneurial) emergence are critical antecedents, it becomes critical to explore the sources of those
antecedents. While we have already addressed the role of experience-driven perceptions, let us delve deeper into one specific antecedent, perceived feasibility, and the
belief structure that drives it: Bandura’s construct of self-efficacy.
One powerful attitude that drives human decision-making is our sense of competence, our belief that we can execute a target behavior (Bandura, 1986, 1995).
Bandura would argue that sizable changes in self-efficacy reflect cognitive change
at a very deep level. Self-efficacy is best influenced by direct mastery experiences,
however, vicarious learning (e.g., behavioral modeling) is also well-documented.
Since Bandura proposed self-efficacy theory over 20 years ago, its research literature has become broad and deep. Of late, entrepreneurship research has increasingly
taken advantage of self-efficacy theory (Mauer et al., 2009).
While Bandura’s description of the self-efficacious individual (optimistically
persistent) sounds as though he is referring to entrepreneurs, the first inkling of
self-efficacy’s importance came from Robert Scherer and his associates (1989) who
found that parents’ impact on their children’s entrepreneurial attitudes depended
on whether they influenced their children’s sense of entrepreneurial competence
(see also Neergaard’s work in Section “Deep Beliefs and Knowledge Structures”
below.) Alan Carsrud and colleagues (1987) came to similar conclusions about role
models and mentors, suggesting that changing critical attitudes such as self-efficacy
perceptions is an important element in promoting entrepreneurial thinking.
Key Conceptual Work: Even earlier, Shapero (1975, 1982) discussed the centrality of perceived feasibility in judging that a potential opportunity is personally
credible, though without using the term self-efficacy. This led to operationalizing
Shapero’s model of the entrepreneurial event with self-efficacy as the key antecedent
of perceived feasibility (Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; Krueger et al., 2000).

<-----Page 18----->13

339

While interest was slow to increase in using self-efficacy in entrepreneurship (Krueger, 1989), Brown (1996) proposed a look at self-efficacy regarding
resource acquisition, marshaling resources being a crucial element in successful entrepreneurship. This narrower domain illustrates the need to focus on the
critical dimensions of entrepreneurial competencies. While Brown focused on a
specific dimension, Alex DeNoble et al. (1999) developed a measure to tap multiple
entrepreneurial competencies while Chen et al.’s (1998) measure is broader still.
Although Bandura considers self-efficacy as being task-specific, measures of general (not task-specific) self-efficacy have been proposed and validated, and Robert
Baron argues that this broadest conception of entrepreneurial competency should
also be useful. This suggests the value of a validity study that rigorously compares
the existing measures (Kickul & D’Intino, 2005).
Key Early Empirical Work: While self-efficacy was originally conceived as
a Person X Situation variable, some scholars have explored self-efficacy as a person variable. Although the term self-efficacy was not used, an interesting study by
Chandler and Jansen (1992) developed and tested a measure of perceived competence to great success: Entrepreneurs do perceive themselves as highly competent.
More recently, Baron found that entrepreneurs score higher on a measure of general
self-efficacy. Gatewood and colleagues (2002) explored links between perceived
ability and expectancies. These latter three studies reinforce the potency of selfefficacy as a useful construct in this domain, but they also suggest that we need
to be careful that the theoretical basis for research is aligned with the empirical
methods that we employ.
Work by Scherer, Shapero, and others led to a major experimental study that
directly tested the impact of self-efficacy on opportunity and threat perceptions and
on risk taking (Krueger, 1989; Krueger & Dickson, 1994). This study found that
self-efficacy significantly influenced opportunity and threat perceptions. In turn,
opportunity and threat perceptions influenced risk taking in two different tasks.
More important, the findings show that the impact of self-efficacy was task-specific;
that is, despite the two tasks being highly similar, self-efficacy on one task did not
influence self-efficacy on the other.
Measurement is important and challenges remain in measuring entrepreneurial
self-efficacy. Chen and colleagues (1998) developed a self-efficacy instrument
that attempts to capture the key dimensions of entrepreneurial competency.
DeNoble et al. (1999) developed an instrument that captures a narrower notion of
entrepreneurial competency with less focus on managerial tasks. Both instruments
appear psychometrically sound and demonstrate considerable validity. Similarly,
students in entrepreneurship classes demonstrate small, but significant positive
changes in entrepreneurial self-efficacy even over a semester (e.g., Krueger, 2001).
Future Directions for Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Research: Considerable
work remains ahead in developing (and deploying) more refined self-efficacy measures. Brown’s example of developing a reliable, valid measure of a more specific
competency fits well with the conception of self-efficacy as task-specific; other competencies are worthy of similar analysis. We also need to assess the relative impact
of more task-specific measures and of general self-efficacy.

<-----Page 19----->340

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

We should also test the relationship between levels and changes in self-efficacy
with deeper cognitive structures. If Bandura is correct, major shifts in self-efficacy
should be associated with significant change in scripts and maps [see next section].
For example, is a high level of self-efficacy at opportunity recognition associated with evidence of an expert script for opportunity recognition? In many ways,
the entrepreneurship domain should prove ideal for testing these as yet untested
relationships.
However, the two most promising trajectories for entrepreneurial self-efficacy
research are relatively new. Helle Neergaard and colleagues (Mauer et al., 2009)
has turned the table and examined self-efficacy as a consequence (entrepreneurial
self-efficacy as dependent variable, not independent). From whence do self-efficacy
beliefs arise? How do they develop cognitively? For example, how do youthful
experiences affect self-efficacy perceptions whether playing sports or even fairy
tales?
The other key direction derives from the realization that self-efficacy is likely
intertwined with other control beliefs. Monsen and Urbig (2009) have combined
self-efficacy and locus of control into a very promising model of mixed control
beliefs that has significant implications for other cognitive phenomena, including
entrepreneurial intentions.

Deep Beliefs and Knowledge Structures
Most human decision-making occurs via automatic processing. Oversimplifying a
bit, we possess a large set of if-then rules to guide our behavior. Many decisions
simply derive from a relatively limited set of decision rules based on an equally limited set of very deep anchoring assumptions. Only relatively few human decisions
are processing mindfully and even there we might find these deep assumptions still
in play.
As such it becomes very important to understand as best we can what deep
assumptions lie beneath our intentions (Krueger, 2007). Moreover, these assumptions also represent the critical architecture of how we structure our knowledge
(including our cognitive scripts, schemas, and maps). This certainly seems to be the
next frontier in entrepreneurial intentions research, if not entrepreneurial cognition
in general, and we urge the reader to give significant thought to these issues.
If critical attitudes such as self-efficacy lie beneath intentions, what lies beneath
those attitudes? In Simon’s terms, we move now from the “semantic” level of
knowledge representation to the “symbolic” level and explore how these levels
interact.
Cognitive science has long shown how attitudes and beliefs expressed on the
surface also reflect their genesis in deeper structures of how we represent knowledge
and how knowledge is interrelated. That is, knowledge does not exist just as discrete
“data” but knowledge is interconnected. Think of it as a relational database where
data entries include how each datum is linked to other data. Again, this suggests

<-----Page 20----->13

Looking Forward, Looking Backward

341

that skillful application of theory and methods relating to pattern recognition could
prove extremely illuminating.
It is critical to understand how all these cognitive phenomena are interconnected.
Bird (1992) argued early on that entrepreneurs’ intentions are driven by deeper
structures such as schemata. More important, though, is that this under-researched
arena could prove immensely fruitful, not just for research but also for enhancing
our ability to stimulate entrepreneurial thinking at a very deep level. It might, for
example, allow us additional tools to compare different types of entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Westhead et al., 2005).
This is much more than metaphor. These deeper structures are powerful influences on how we think. If we are to enhance entrepreneurial thinking beyond a
superficial level, we need to help entrepreneurs change these deeper structures in
appropriate directions.

Automatic versus Intentional Processing
Deep beliefs come into play unobtrusively whenever we gain sufficient experience
such that a once mindful process evolves into an automatic process. While we
may often exhibit intentional, planned behavior, much of our decision-making operates via automatic processing, driven by deep assumptions of which we are likely
unaware. This is highly adaptive in that we cannot consciously process every single
decision we face. If we have automated how to drive out of a skid on an icy road, that
is good. If our deep assumption is an ugly racial prejudice, that is very bad. What
may seem purely instinctive is often completely learned. Understanding the deep
“why” of our decision-making is imperative. Cognitive mechanisms worth considering here include mental prototyping, schemata (and schemas), scripts, and maps.
Since we operate under significant bounded rationality, there are many gaps that
our minds readily fill – often based on very deeply seated assumptions. Consider,
for example, role identity and related constructs such as perceived role demands.
Our mental prototypes of “opportunity” and of “entrepreneur” differ widely and are
almost certainly anchored by powerful deep assumptions (Krueger, 2007). Despite
the effort required to surface these deep beliefs, it may be the only way to truly
understand these mental prototypes that are so important (e.g., Baron & Ensley,
2006). We all have mental prototypes (not just stereotypes per se) of “opportunity”
and of “entrepreneur.” If someone’s mental prototype of “entrepreneur” does not
include them, it will be much harder for them to become (let alone succeed at)
entrepreneurial (Baron, 2006; Krueger, 2007).

Schemata, Scripts, and Maps
This area has seen the most development and the most fruitful results. Kets de Vries
(1996) has shown how deep beliefs about “how things work” and deeply seated
“hot buttons” can have profound positive and especially negative (1996) effects

<-----Page 21----->342

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

on entrepreneurial behavior which can be characterized as more entrepreneurial
schemata (e.g., Alvarez & Barney, 2008).
In scripts, the work of Ron Mitchell and associates has been highly visible,
even outside the field of entrepreneurship (e.g., Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell et al.,
2000, 2009). The key trigger for this whole approach has been the realization that
experts think differently than novices. How experts become experts is reflected in
the development of an “expert” script. (A script is, as its name suggests, a cognitive
mechanism that comprises the key elements in a decision situation and the likely
ordering of events.)
The “expert” script can differ from the “novice” script in any number of ways:
It can be more complex but can be more parsimonious. In most cases, the knowledge involved will differ (the obvious case being that experts will typically have
more accurate information). We cannot readily identify a script directly, but we can
recognize the degree to which an expert (or novice) script is present. We do so
by identifying critical cues that signal expertise (e.g., Mitchell & Chesteen, 1995;
Mitchell et al., 2000).
Mitchell’s original work focused primarily on differences between expert and
novice scripts regarding entrepreneurship writ large (1995). However, he and his
colleagues have continued by identifying expert scripts for subprocesses such as
expert scripts for marshaling resources or for identifying opportunities (Gustavsson
et al., 2007) while others have extended the approach to intriguing domains (Neck
et al., 2007; Welsh & Krueger, 2009). As we shall see in Section “Implications for
Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)”, this has powerful implications.
Connie Marie Gaglio and Jerome Katz (2001) approach the same topic of
entrepreneurial scripts but from the perspective of seeking opportunity, to use
Kirzner’s (1982) term, entrepreneurial “alertness.” Understanding the overall expert
script is invaluable but drilling down to more specific cognitive processes (e.g.,
counterfactual thinking) affords researchers a look at the most fundamental aspects
of entrepreneurial thinking. This too has important implications for teaching and
training.
Cognitive maps have not been widely deployed in entrepreneurship research
until recently (Brännback & Carsrud, 2009). Jenkins and Johnson (1997) cleverly
linked the cognitive maps of entrepreneurs to measures of intention. Given the evidence from Mitchell and his colleagues that entrepreneurial training can measurably
change an individual’s scripts toward those of an expert, so too should we see measurable changes in an entrepreneur’s (nascent or otherwise) maps. We might also
find it useful to see how maps and scripts relate to one another. Entrepreneurship
could prove an ideal venue for such research that would offer a contribution far
beyond entrepreneurship research.

Knowledge Structures Matter: Some Final Evidence
In recent years, we have realized new insights into how we learn to think
entrepreneurially. We have found constructs that fully moderate the intentions

<-----Page 22----->13

Looking Forward, Looking Backward

343

model. Differences in cognitive style can yield dramatically different pathways in
the formation of intent. That is, the intentions model for learners who score as preferring intuitive thinking differs significantly from the model for those scoring as
preferring an analytic cognitive style (Krueger & Kickul, 2006). “Another example:” “Push” or “necessity” entrepreneurs may differ from “opportunity” or “pull”
entrepreneurs. Might one expect that an entrepreneur pushed into self-employment
by necessity would focus first on feasibility perceptions whereas an entrepreneur
“pulled” by an opportunity would consider desirability perceptions first?
This implies explicit consideration of differing initial beliefs (e.g., cognitive
styles) among our students and, given the constructivist paradigm, implies encouraging a broad range of cognitive styles and other learning styles in our students. If
the differences in something as simple as cognitive style matters that much, then
what are the implications for all the other ways that students may differ cognitively?
One critical (and highly testable) implication is that learning processes can
change deep mental models in the direction of better entrepreneurial thinking
whether in terms of learning to see more/better opportunities or to see oneself as
an entrepreneur (or as we have noted, both). Both Baron (2000b) and Gaglio (2004)
demonstrate how the cognitive mechanism of counterfactual reasoning is a potent
lever for stimulating students to question their existing mental models. This clearly
suggests that measures of deep structures, whether scripts or maps or other possibilities, can be usefully deployed to research how entrepreneurial thinking changes
as entrepreneurs learn to be entrepreneurial (and more expertly entrepreneurial) and
thus examine how deep beliefs change across a training program (Krueger, 2001;
Mitchell et al., 2000).

Future Research Direction: Phase Changes Revisited
Cognitive developmental psychology has long noted that human psychosocial development occurs in reasonably distinct stages connected by transition periods that are
inherently experiential (Erikson, 1980). In children, it is the “terrible twos” that
demarcates infancy and early childhood. We see very different knowledge structures in these different stages; we also see consistent (and diagnostically useful)
phenomena that characterize transition. This affords us a good sense of someone’s psychosocial development and how to help them navigate transitions. What
if entrepreneurial intentions evolve similarly, exhibiting phase changes?
If we plot intentions against a key attitude such as self-efficacy, we tend to see
evidence that the optimal fit is not linear. It may be that noise and measurement error
are amplified unpredictably, but one can also make the case that we are actually
seeing one or two inflection points in the data that reflect a phase change in the
evolution of individuals’ entrepreneurial thinking.
That is, as entrepreneurial intentions evolve, they go through different stages. Just
as entrepreneurial ventures move from ideation to nascency to launch, might not
intentions follow a similar pattern, moving from one cognitive regime to another?

<-----Page 23----->344

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

If so, we should see interesting cognitive differences between the regimes. How do
knowledge structures differ across the phases? What are the critical developmental experiences associated with each phase and with each transition? For example,
Erikson (1980) would argue that transitions would necessarily engage hot cognitions. (Please see Fig. 13.5below.) Such evidence would also be of invaluable
diagnostic assistance to educators and to practitioners.

Implications for Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)
What do entrepreneurs need to learn? How do they best learn that knowledge
and the necessary skills? It seems reasonable to note that entrepreneurs need to
learn how to identify opportunities. Most research into entrepreneurship education has been descriptive, despite an increasing interest in theory-driven research
(much like research into opportunity recognition). This area cries out for extensive
theory-driven research.
What we are learning has enormous potential implications for entrepreneurial
education (and in some ways we see best practice in pedagogy that fits the dynamic
model of intent even better than the static case.) The process of learning (and ideally
the process of educating) does much more than add knowledge content to the learners. The old behaviorist model of students as relatively passive vessels to be filled
with information has largely given way to the constructivist model which assumes
that the real objective of education is to help learners to evolve how they structure
that knowledge. In short, train minds not memories.
However, it is equally important to recognize that while this process may increase
their attitudes and intentions toward entrepreneurship, we must also increase them
in productive directions. Inspiring an ill-informed student to launch a venture borders on the negligent. The goal, of course, is to move learners from a mindset that
is closer to a novice entrepreneur toward a mindset more like that of an expert
entrepreneur with “informed intent” (Hindle & Klyver, 2009; Krueger et al., 2007).

<-----Page 24----->13

“Filling a Pail” or “Lighting a Fire”?
Thereare two dominant paradigms in education. The traditional approach focuses on
fact-based learning (includes rote memorization and repetitive drilling). Instructors
typically provide the models and framework for knowledge being transferred to
students. Constructivism argues for situated learning where students acquire knowledge but also have to develop their own ways of organizing the knowledge (building
and changing their own mental models to represent knowledge). “Learning the
answers” versus “finding the questions” is one way to think about the difference
or one might use the words of W.B. Yeats paraphrased in the subhead above.
Entrepreneurship educators tend to fall into the second camp (Krueger, 2009a).
Traditional methods provide greater control to the instructor and can appear as
more efficient for large groups of students. Constructivistic methods tend to be much
more student-centered, but this actually reflects how humans actually learn in daily
life: by trial and error in a social setting. Moreover, if one wishes to change deeper
cognitive structures such as scripts, then more student-centered learning is imperative. For example, Albert Bandura’s Social Learning Theory suggests an iterative
process by which deeply held beliefs and attitudes co-evolve as learners actively
acquire, process, and organize new knowledge.
Thomas Monroy (1995) was perhaps first to articulate that traditional classroom
methods were not only less frequently used in entrepreneurship classes but probably
are less effective than more experiential approaches. Rather, expert entrepreneurship educators tend to emphasize “problem-based learning” where learners focus on
real-world issues, a focus that is a staple of most entrepreneurship courses. Indeed,
the most popular and successful training techniques used in entrepreneurship tend
to strongly reflect the constructivist model: Living cases (e.g., SBI), shadowing,
etc. (Jack & Anderson, 1999; Krueger, 2009a; Krueger & Hamilton, 1996). Even
when applied to more behaviorist tasks like business plans, reflective, constructivist
approaches yield significant improvement (e.g., Honig, 2004).
Organizations (and communities) seeking a more entrepreneurial climate require
more entrepreneurial thinking in its members (Krueger, 2000; Krueger & Brazeal,
1994). Classrooms are no different. As with organizations, educators must seek
to develop a fertile seedbed that supports entrepreneurial thinking. This cognitive infrastructure supports entrepreneurial thinking and the changes in cognitive
structures such as intentions and attitudes and even deeper cognitive structures
such as students’ personal mental models of “what is an entrepreneur?” Am I an
entrepreneur?” But what influences change in such deep knowledge structures?
What changes those deep anchoring beliefs?

Critical Developmental Experiences
Prior experience certainly influences perception of future opportunities (Shane,
2000) but this operates at a much deeper cognitive level (Krueger, 2007, 2009b).
As learners move from novice mindsets toward expert mindsets, some changes are

<-----Page 25----->346

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

highly incremental, especially where knowledge content is involved. However, the
important changes involve knowledge structures where change is often more abrupt
(e.g., “aha!” moments).
The Center for Creative Leadership has found that top managers share a surprisingly small set of critical developmental experiences [see Fig. 13.4] and an even
smaller set of the lessons learned (McCall et al., 1988). We might profitably reprise
that research for entrepreneurs. For example, we have some evidence that growing
up in a family business influences attitudes and intentions toward entrepreneurship (Krueger, 1993b). Formal training/teaching can also matter as entrepreneurial
training programs significantly influence the various antecedents of entrepreneurial
attitudes and intentions (Cooper & Lucas, 2007). Even formal coursework (Cox,
1996; Krueger, 2001) appears to have a small but measurable impact on critical
beliefs (e.g., self-efficacy) and attitudes (including intent) (Fig. 13.6).

The issues surrounding how learning processes can change deeply held mental models in the direction of better entrepreneurial thinking, whether in terms of
learning to see more/better opportunities or to see oneself as an entrepreneur (or,
as we have noted, both) represent powerful research opportunities that also bring
immediate practical impact. Consider that the University of Victoria, Texas Tech,
Western Ontario and elsewhere have developed pedagogies that heavily emphasize
helping students acquire expert scripts (e.g., Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2000,
2009). This clearly suggests that measures of deep structures, whether scripts or
maps or other possibilities, can be usefully deployed to research how entrepreneurial
thinking changes across a training program (Krueger, 2001; Mitchell et al., 2000).
The rule of thumb is that to become an expert requires 10,000–20,000 hours of
deliberate practice at activities which move one toward the expert mindset (Baron &

<-----Page 26----->13

Looking Forward, Looking Backward

347

Henry, 2006; Ericsson & Charness, 1994). But what are those deep belief-changing
activities? For example, both Baron (2000b) and Gaglio (2001) demonstrate how the
cognitive mechanism of counterfactual reasoning is a potent lever for encouraging
and reinforcing students to question their existing mental models.
In short, we have ample reason to believe that if the expert mindset exists, then
we can use what we know about the expert mindset to guide our teaching (e.g.,
Krueger, 2009a; Mitchell, 2005) and move learners toward a truly informed intent.
But to do so we need to begin learning from neuroscience. The constructivist model
teaches us that learners, intentions and related attitudes will change but only insofar as they reflect changes in deep anchoring beliefs (Krueger, 2009a). To change
how we structure what we know, especially in the direction of a more informed
expert intent, the learner goes through multiple critical developmental experiences
that change their deep beliefs. Imagine how much richer our efforts would be if
we embraced the neuroscientific approach. Consider the following evidence from
recent neuroscience efforts.

Cognitive Adaptability: Learning and Adapting
Lawrence et al. (2008) “propose that entrepreneurs represent an example of highly
adaptive risk-taking behaviour, with positive functional outcomes in the context of stressful economic decision-making.” Sarasvathy (2001) argues that the
entrepreneur should be put on center stage; that we “go beyond explanations based
on economic forces and evolutionary adaptation to entrepreneurial effectuation.”
One particular area of interest that relates to the physiological drivers of adaptation
is that key brain systems responsible for recognizing the familiar and negotiating the
unfamiliar have been identified. These have been termed by different researchers
“System 1 and System 2” (Camerer et al., 2005; Kahneman, 2003) and the
“C-system and X-system” (Lieberman et al., 2002; Satpute & Lieberman, 2006). It
is probable that these systems are in play when it comes to adaptability. Put simply,
the X-system recognizes patterns and symbols via a type of passive parallel processing, producing the continuous stream of consciousness we experience. When the
X-system is confronted by sensory data that it does not recognize, it passes responsibility over to the C-system which uses a set of standards or rules that attempt to
harmonize this new data with what is already known.

Pattern Recognition and Transfer
These brain systems give insight into a complex thinking matrix and would seem
to represent the neural substrates underpinning for instance, analogical transfer
(Magee, 2005) or conceptual combination analysis (Ward, 2004) where information
and experiences, concepts, or images from what is known are used by the decisionmaker(s) in an attempt to find a solution for a new, unfamiliar situation. Simon

<-----Page 27----->348

N.F. Krueger and M. Day

(1997) writes “when the expert is confronted with a situation in his or her domain,
various features of cues in the situation will attract attention” and the expert will act
intuitively to come up with a solution. Simon argues that “[i]ntuition, judgement,
creativity are basically expression of capabilities for recognition and response based
upon experience and knowledge.” Each entrepreneur may experience this to varying levels when confronted with, for example, a stressful economic decision-making
environment, which in turn might trigger opportunity recognition.
For researchers, we need a better empirical understanding of how
entrepreneurship-related cognitive phenomena are interrelated across Simon’s
(1963) three levels: Neurological, symbolic, and semantic. What “semantic”
level cues are associated with “symbolic” level structures underlying opportunity
perception? The rich cognitive science literature on pattern recognition could be
exploited most fruitfully to address this.

Context Matters: Entrepreneurial Environments
Even a solo entrepreneur does not operate in a vacuum. As Granovetter famously
pointed out, almost all economic activity is irretrievably embedded in its social
context, yet we often neglect the often-complex social context (e.g., Dimov, 2007,
Carsrud et al., 2007). Leo-Paul Dana has studied a dizzying array of economies
around the world and finds that “opportunity” is very much culture-dependent
(1995). One obvious impact is through the social norms antecedent of intentions
(and self-efficacy), but social cues from community and family can also affect
other cognitive phenomena, often in non-obvious fashion. Han and Northoff (2008)
and others show that cultural differences can manifest in significant differences in
cognitive processes, even at an early age.
Family norms add another dimension to the cognitive appraisal in the intentions
process but may also bring other dimensions into bold relief. This is an exciting
direction for family business research with broader implications for entrepreneurship (e.g., Carsrud et al., 2007; Stavrou, 1999). Likewise, high-tech opportunities
merit more consideration; how do the processes differ in highly innovative organizations (Brazeal, 1993; Corbett, 2002; Neck et al., 2007). However, the fundamental
question here that has seen far too little research efforts is this. If the entrepreneurial
potential of an organization or a community is thus a function of the quantity
and quality of its potential entrepreneurs, then should we not explore what kinds
of environments support entrepreneurial activity by supporting and reinforcing
entrepreneurial thinking (Day, 2002)? At the community level, there are visible differences in communities that are entrepreneurial (e.g., Audretsch, 2007; Peredo &
Chrisman, 2004). What characterizes them?
Cognitive Infrastructure in Organizations: The intentions perspective affords
us important insights into how to nurture the entrepreneurial potential of an organization or a community. Again: Entrepreneurial potential depends on the quantity and
quality of potential entrepreneurs (Krueger & Brazeal, 1994). Increasing the quality

<-----Page 28----->13

Looking Forward, Looking Backward

349

and quantity of potential entrepreneurs requires increasing the quality and quantity
of entrepreneurial thinking. Thus, the entrepreneurial organization must operate in
directions that support its members in perceiving more – and better – opportunities,
such as beliefs and activities that foster internal entrepreneurs to see intrapreneurship as desirable and feasible (Brazeal & Herbert, 1999). It is reasonable to assume
that modeling effects are critical – that the impact of mentors and role models serve
to enhance processes of modeling entrepreneurial behavior and attitudes (Krueger,
2000; Shepherd & Krueger, 2002).
The entrepreneurial organization does require a tangible infrastructure of
resources and mechanisms that support entrepreneurial activities, yet field research
shows that this is clearly insufficient to yield significant levels of entrepreneurship.
Rather, organization members must perceive that tangible infrastructure as a supportive one (Brazeal, 1993; Brazeal & Herbert, 2000; Brown & Wiklund 2001;
Krueger & Brazeal, 1994). It is not enough to provide the “proper” reward system. What if organization members perceive the existing reward system as being
actually hostile to entrepreneurship? (Day, 2002; Shane & Kolvereid, 1995)
This implies that organizations (or, for that matter, communities) need to provide
and develop a “cognitive infrastructure” that nurtures entrepreneurial thinking. The
intentions perspective implies mechanisms that increase the quantity and quality
of perceived opportunities. This then requires mechanisms that broaden the set of
possibilities that organization members perceive as feasible and as desirable and
suggests that organizations seek to address each of the key antecedents: Personal
attitude, social norms, self-efficacy, and collective efficacy (Krueger, 2000). Section
“Implications for Entrepreneurial Learning (and Education)” above argues we can
take these findings to design training programs and even coursework; Guth et al.,
showed how we can transform cognition research to successful practice (1991). How
do we best train people to perceive themselves as entrepreneurial? How do we best
train people to see personally credible opportunities?
The contextual perspective also offers two additional, important domains for
ground-breaking research. First, as we better understand the “why” behind the
entrepreneurial mindset, we can better understand the “how” of nurturing it (and
the accompanying policy implications). Second, initial evidence is persuasive that
studying social (and sustainable) entrepreneurs provides broad, deep insights into
entrepreneurial thinking.
Cognitive Infrastructure in Communities: There is also immense potential
in digging deeper into this cognitive infrastructure behind entrepreneurship within
organizations and communities. This seems a most fruitful avenue for further study
as researchers can test the impact of various strategic prescriptions on these key
antecedents. Does the presence of strong champions enhance perceptions of efficacy
(e.g., modeling successful behavior) or enhance social norms (e.g., by demonstrating that a community does support entrepreneurial activity)? We can diagnose
shortfalls in entrepreneurial activity by testing these same antecedents. Similarly,
highly entrepreneurial communities seem to share a cognitive infrastructure that
rewards entrepreneurial activity and especially entrepreneurial thinking (Audretsch,
2007; Peredo & Chrisman, 2006).

<-----Page 29----->350

Social and Sustainable Entrepreneurship: While a topic far beyond the scope
of this chapter, these twin domains have grown immensely in recent years with
a corresponding proliferation of definitions – much like entrepreneurship itself
in its early days (e.g., Bacq & Janssen, 2008). Nonetheless, social (and sustainable) entrepreneurship offers multiple opportunities to enlighten us about the
entrepreneurial process writ large (Mair & Marti, 2005). In particular, the cognitive
processes of social and sustainable entrepreneurs have already taught us much about
entrepreneurial opportunities (Krueger, 1998, 2005; Krueger et al., 2008; Welsh &
Krueger, 2009). This is an ideal arena for exploring entrepreneurial thinking. In fact,
social entrepreneurship research may be dominated by inconsistent definitions and
dustball empiricism but it is already teaching us much about how we identify and
evaluate opportunities (Krueger et al., 2008, 2009). Deep belief structures may be
in play here as well, providing additional potential for neuroscience methods.

In Conclusion
The suggestions offered above are just the beginning, but we look forward to the
ongoing adventure of answering those questions (and the questions those answers
will inevitably raise). However, if we are ever to truly understand entrepreneurship,
it is imperative that we understand the multifaceted nature of entrepreneurial thinking and of its genesis and there is much in past research that has been neglected in
the rapid growth of research into entrepreneurial cognition.
The history of entrepreneurship research suggests that many surprises lie in store
for researchers. As we discussed above, we know relatively little about how intentions change and even less about intentions about the timing of behavior. More
important, we now know that we must delve ever deeper into “what lies beneath”
entrepreneurial phenomena. Given that entrepreneurial intentions change quite significantly over time, entrepreneurship might well prove ideal for exploring these
questions. Fortunately, the answers uncovered to date have, as always happens in
science, also uncovered even more intriguing questions – and good places to start
the next frontier. In this chapter, it has seemed useful to point out questions with
great potential as we explored the disparate threads of entrepreneurial cognition.
We hope this chapter has helped the reader to see the potential for increasing our
skillful, rigorous use of theory and tools from cognitive science. We also hope that
readers also see that the even faster growth of research using theories and methods inspired by neuroscience offers equally great potential for those of us intensely
curious about entrepreneurial thinking.
