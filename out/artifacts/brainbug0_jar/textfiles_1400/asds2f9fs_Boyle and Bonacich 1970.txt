on the existenceof consensusin Scheff'ssense.Anotherway of puttingthisis that consensus
between two rational players can lead to noncooperation and, surprisingly,dissensus
between two rational players can lead to cooperation. This is stronglyshown in the
followingillustration.Two players,ego and alter,are both rational playersand they both
know that their opponent-partnersare rational players. But, both of them mistakenly
thinkthat theiropponentsthinkthat they are not rational players. Ego thinksthat alter
thinksthat ego is the kind of player who will play cooperativelyuntil alter plays noncooperatively,and alter thinksthat ego thinksthat alter is the kind of player who will
play cooperativelyuntil ego plays noncooperatively.In Scheff'slanguage,agreementexists
(they are both rational and have the same payoffmatrices), understandingexists (they
both known the payoffmatrices of their rational opponents), but realization does not
exist.And thislack of consensusat the thirdremoveis sufficient
to invalidatethe otherwise
inevitable conclusion that rational players do not cooperate. In this case, each player
will play cooperativelybecause he will feel thatif he plays noncooperativelythe otherwill
be forcedto play noncooperativelyalso. Thus, lack of consensuscan lead to mutual cooperationbetweentwo playerswho would nevercooperateif therewere consensus.

We have outlineda relationship

In this respectthe theoryresemblesa learningtheorymodel developedby
Rapoportand Maushowitz(1966), whichassumesthat Player'sprobability

But thereis a crucialdifference
betweenthe Rapoport-Maushowitz

and thepresenttheory.We explicitlydo not assumethata player'sbehavior
is determined
by his expectations.
Rather,we positwhatHoward (1966) has
called the existentialist

difficult
the game), the greatermustbe the eventualtrustbetweenthe two
players.More generally,the lowerthe initialexpectations,the greaterthe
increasein trust.For example,if the matrixvalues are such thatthe caution
indexis verylow,thereis littleadvantageto eitherplayerfordefecting,
and
littletrustneed developbetweenthem.However,if defectionis an attractive
alternative,
a large amountof trustwould have to be built up betweenthe

But by the same token,if a playerdecidesthat adequate reciprocation

EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THE THEORY
1. The firsthypothesisstates that expectations are modifiedin proportion

to theempiricalinaccuracyofpreviousexpectations.
Especiallyrelevanthereis a studyreportedby Pruitt(1967). In whathe
calls a "decomposedPD game" (DPD), Pruittpresentedthe same basic PD
matrixfromthreedifferent
"perspectives"of whateach playergains or loses
fromeach play, C or D. These are shownin Figure6; note that the actual

at about thatlevel throughout.
SubjectsplayingDPD II and IV startedoff

increasedto about 80%o aftertwentytrials,while in DPD II it declined
rapidly,movingto less than 15%oaftertwentytrials.Subjectsplayingthe

Swinth(1967) set up a special seriesof gamesin whichthe playerstook
turnsin makingtheirplays,ratherthan actingsimultaneously.
This means
thattheplayerwhogoesfirstcan explicitly
signalhis cooperativeintent,since
if he makes a cooperativemove he foregoesthe possibilityof gettinghis
maximalpayoffand also exposeshimselfto the risk thathis opponentmay
not reciprocate.However,he also knowsthat on the next trial this order
willbe reversed.By thusplacinghimselfat themercyof his opponent,rather
than rationallypursuinghis short-run
selfishinterests(that is, by making
his actual behaviormuchmorecooperativethanhis expectedbehavior),he is
signallinga desireto raise the level of trust.Swinthused a programmed
opponent,instructed
to initiatetrustgestureswhengoingfirst,and to respond
in kind whenplayingsecond (that is, to matchthe choiceinitiatedby the
naive subject). Followingthisseriesof sequentialmoveson special matrices,
the subjectswenton to play an actual PD game withsimultaneous
choices.
The findings
were that subjectsgenerallyrespondedto trustgesturesby
behavingcooperatively,
and followedthisup on theactual PD gamewithan

It is knownthat friends
are morelikely to cooperatethan strangers,
but Krauss also investigated
changesin sentiment
duringthe courseof the game. He manipulatedthree
independentvariables: (1) Positive or negative sentimentsbetween the
players,(2) whetherthesesentiments
had been made salientthroughstrong
or weak anchoring,
and (3) whetherthe game theywereplayingencouraged
cooperationor competition.
The firstset of findings,columns1 and 2 of
Figure 7, shows that subjectswith positivesentimentstowardeach other,
and subjectsplayingthecooperativegame weremoresuccessfulin achieving
cooperation(since playersearnedbetterpayoffs,i.e. higherscores,if they
cooperated).In those cases in whichsentimentsand game structureconflicted,sentiments
prevailedwhen theywere stronglyanchored,and game
structureprevailedwhen sentiments
were weaklyanchored.While this fits
the generaltheory,however,the presentfocusis on the next two columns,
