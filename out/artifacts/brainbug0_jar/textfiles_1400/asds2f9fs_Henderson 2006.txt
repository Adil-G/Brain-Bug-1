The Innovator’s Dilemma as a Problem of
Organizational Competence
Rebecca Henderson

Introduction
This paper explores the role of embedded organizational competencies in shaping the innovator’s
dilemma. I argue that while popular accounts of
Christensen’s theories often focus almost entirely on
the role of cognitive failures in the senior team as the
central explanatory construct, this focus obscures the
critical role played by deeply embedded customer or
market-related competencies in shaping the ways
ﬁrms respond to disruptive innovations.
It has now been nearly eight years since Clayton
Christensen ﬁrst published The Innovator’s Dilemma
(1997). Since then it has not only had a dramatic impact on practice—disruptive innovation is now a common term of art—but it has also served to reignite
debate within academia as to the role of the market in
shaping incumbent response to discontinuous technological change.
Christensen’s work brought an intriguingly different perspective to the existing literature. Scholars
studying the management of technology had, by and
large, located the difﬁculties established ﬁrms encountered in responding to discontinuous innovation as a
problem of competence. Much of this work was supply-side focused—failing incumbents appeared to fall
victim to competence-destroying innovations that
made it difﬁcult for them to introduce the next generation of technology (e.g., Henderson and Clark,
1990; Tushman and Anderson, 1986). But research
had also identiﬁed the difﬁculty established ﬁrms
encountered in responding to shifts in the market

place (e.g., Abernathy and Clark, 1985) and in the
larger institutional and social regime (e.g., the excellent survey in Chesbrough, 2001).
Christensen (1997) explicitly rejected problems in
technological competence as an explanation for ﬁrm
failure in the examples he described—in the disk drive
industry, for example, he demonstrates quite clearly
that the incumbent ﬁrms had no difﬁculties in developing the next generation of product—and instead
focused attention on problems in decision making at
the most senior levels. Drawing on resource dependency theory, he argued that senior teams are, in
essence, captured by their largest, most profitable
customers, making it exceedingly difﬁcult to allocate
resources to initiatives that serve new customers at
lower margins.
The fact that Christensen’s work has met with such
success suggests that this explanation resonates deeply
with practicing managers. My own experience in
working with senior teams grappling with potential
disruption has also highlighted its usefulness. Time
after time I have seen senior conversations about
long-term innovation strategy hijacked or short
circuited by appeals to the pressing needs of large,
highly profitable customers, and as Eisenmann’s work
in the newspaper industry has shown, sheltering new
initiatives from the margin pressure characteristic of
the current business may be a critical step toward
building successful disruptive businesses (Eisenmann
and Bower, 2000). Christensen’s hypothesis is thus a
critically important idea that must play a central role
in understanding why disruption creates so much
competitive turmoil.
Nevertheless, this article argues that a focus on
the dynamics of decision making in the senior team as
the dominant explanation for why established ﬁrms so

<-----Page 1----->6

often miss disruptive innovations is potentially
misleading—particularly as it has been interpreted
in the popular press. I suggest that organizational
competence, in the traditional sense of the embedded
organizational routines of established companies, may
be much more central to established ﬁrm failure in
the face of disruptive innovation than is generally
acknowledged. Christensen himself offers tantalizing hints of this possibility throughout his published
work, and I argue that expanding on these hints
to acknowledge the depth and complexity of the role
played by embedded organizational competence is
critically important in understanding why responding to disruptive innovation is so difﬁcult for established ﬁrms.
The article begins by tackling the important question of whether it is rational, from the perspective of
the shareholders, for established ﬁrms to respond to
disruptive innovation. Although popular interpretations of Christensen’s work assume that established
ﬁrms not introducing disruptive innovation are failures, I argue that as Christensen himself acknowledges this is not an easy question. Indeed if established competencies in production and marketing are
not only difﬁcult to change but also, by their very
presence, are barriers to the development of new,
more appropriate competencies, then deciding not to
respond to disruptive innovation may be a completely
rational choice.
I then turn to a discussion of the circumstances in
which a response to disruptive innovation would have
been, ex post, a rational decision and explore why established ﬁrms ﬁnd it so difﬁcult to respond appropriately even in this subset of cases. I build on the
work of Ron Adner, who in a sequence of careful
papers has shown how changes in the structure of
consumer demand—in combination with technical
progress—almost certainly lie behind the phenomenon of disruption (e.g., Adner, 2002; Adner and
Zemsky, 2005). I argue that the established routines
of large incumbent ﬁrms make it particularly difﬁcult
for them ﬁrst to sense and then to act on precisely
these kinds of shifts, so that the decision-making dynamics highlighted by Christensen may be as much a
product of failures in what one might call market-related competence—or of what Danneels (2002, 2004)
calls customer competence—as they are of resource
dependence. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of this hypothesis for future
research and for our understanding of the dynamics
of technical and competitive change.

R. HENDERSON

Is It Rational to Respond to
Disruptive Innovation?
Are established ﬁrms irrational in failing to respond
to disruptive innovation? Christensen’s work can,
I think, be read both ways on this point, but it is a
central question that deserves clariﬁcation. My reading of the Innovator’s Dilemma, and certainly popular
interpretations of the work, seems to suggest that senior teams failing to invest in disruptive innovations
are irrational—that they should have made the appropriate investments but were unsuccessful in doing
so because they were blinded by current customers
and larger margins. However, in the Innovator’s Solution this stance has shifted: the book can be read as
suggesting that established managers who do not respond to disruptive innovation are, in fact, acting in
their ﬁrm’s best interest.
The asymmetries of motivation chronicled in this chapter are natural economic forces that act on all business
people, all the time. Historically, these forces almost
always have toppled the industry leaders . . . because
disruptive strategies are predicated upon competitors
doing with is in their best and most urgent interest:
satisfying their most important customers and investing
where profits are most attractive (Christensen and
Raynor, 2003, p. 55).

The neoclassical literature has identiﬁed a number of
cases under which established ﬁrms might rationally
choose not to invest in innovation threatening to displace them (e.g., the survey of the issue in Henderson,
1993), and it seems plausible that at least some disruptive innovations meet these criteria. If, for example,
an investment by the incumbent ﬁrm will significantly
accelerate the date at which a replacement technology
will be introduced, then under some circumstances it
may be rational for an established ﬁrm to delay its own
investment until it can be certain the new technology
will be introduced by another ﬁrm. But this does not
seem to be the reasoning for the majority of disruptive
innovations identiﬁed in the literature.
When there is no danger of self-induced cannibalization, the neoclassical literature would suggest that
if it is rational for an entrant to invest in a particular
technology it should also be rational for an incumbent
to invest in the same opportunity. Intuitively, if an
opportunity yields a return at greater than the prevalent cost of capital, then it should be attractive to all
potential investors—including incumbents—and the
only (rational) reason an incumbent might choose not

<-----Page 2----->THE INNOVATOR’S DILEMMA AS A PROBLEM OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCE

to invest is if it is capital constrained and the ﬁnancial
markets are willing to fund entrants but not incumbents. The availability of the incumbent’s other, higher-margin projects should not, in a perfectly rational
neoclassical world, have any effect on its willingness
to take on additional profitable projects.
Does this mean we can safely assume that, except
for a few marginal and uncommon cases, managers
who fail to invest in disruptive opportunities are irrational—at least from their shareholders’ perspective—
and blinded by their existing mental models or captured by their dominant constituencies?
I think not. Another possibility is that senior managers rationally anticipate the constraints placed upon
them by their existing organizational competencies.
As Leonard-Barton (1992) suggested, the same competencies that may be an organization’s most enduring source of competitive advantage may also be
competency traps—engrained habits and ways of behaving that make significant change in the organizations modes of operation extraordinarily difﬁcult.
Reconﬁguring an organization to take advantage of
new opportunities is extremely difﬁcult, particularly if
doing so requires the development of new production
capabilities, new logistics or distribution systems, or
new channels to market. Building a new unit within
the old to take advantage of new technology is one
possible solution, but the literature suggests that such
units have significant difﬁculty putting in place appropriate incentive structures and in successfully
imitating the behaviors of successful entrants (e.g.,
the survey reported in Campbell et al., 2003). Viewed
from this perspective, a senior team’s decision to refrain from investing in disruptive innovation can seem
much more rational. Why invest in opportunities the
ﬁrm is much less likely to be able to exploit than de
novo entrants or than ﬁrms entering from related ﬁelds
are already equipped with appropriate capabilities?
Christensen’s (1997) work hints that such forces
may be at work. For example, in the Innovator’s
Solution, he and his coauthor suggest that incumbent
ﬁrms failed to invest because ‘‘the cost structure of
that model and of their distribution and sales channels
was not competitive’’ (p. 106). But if this is the dominant force behind the upheaval we associate with the
Innovator’s Dilemma, it stems from an old-fashioned
concern with competence rather than with any
misperception by the senior team. Incumbent ﬁrms
fail to respond to disruptive innovations because
responding appropriately requires building competencies they are ill-equipped to acquire and not because

they focus too much on existing customers and highmargin opportunities.
But this is clearly not the sense of the original book
or of how Christensen’s (1997) work has been widely
interpreted. Indeed there are hints throughout even
the Innovator’s Solution that Christensen has something else in mind: that established ﬁrms could and
should react to disruptive innovation but that something goes wrong that could implicitly be ﬁxed.
Interpreting Christensen (1997) from this perspective, one possibility is that the underlying problem is
cognitive. Senior managers cannot understand the
promise of disruptive innovation because their
views of the world are deeply entrenched and largely
shaped by their current experiences. Focusing on their
current customers they literally do not see other opportunities. This is consistent with some intriguing
recent work suggesting that the cognitive frames of
senior managers do, indeed, play a major role in guiding strategic decisions (Kaplan, 2004; Tripsas and
Gavetti, 2000).
Another theory is that the problem is political. If
power within an organization adheres to those with
resources, managers in charge of, or aligned with, the
largest and most profitable customers will pull the
most political weight and will be able to divert resources to their own projects.
These two interpretations of Christensen’s (1997)
work have the widest currency, and as suggested already I am deeply sympathetic to both of them: they
both clearly play an important role in making it difﬁcult for established ﬁrms to respond to disruptive
innovation. To them, however, I propose a third,
competence-based explanation. As Danneels (2004)
suggested, I argue that organizational competencies—
particularly market facing or customer competence
developed through experience with the existing generation of the technology—make it very difﬁcult to
evaluate the promise of disruptive technologies and
thus that the senior team is very rarely equipped with
the information they might need to make an appropriate decision (Danneels, 2004).
Christensen and Raynor’s (2003) distinction between low-end disruptions and new-market disruptions
is a useful building block in this argument. Low-end
disruptions introduce products or services that are
cheaper and of lower quality than existing products
but that offer no other performance improvement.
New-market disruptions, on the other hand, offer
better performance on dimensions the current
customers do not greatly value. Christensen’s (1997)

account of the disruption of the steel industry by minimills is an example of the ﬁrst kind of disruption, and
I read his account of the evolution of the disk drive
industry as an example of the second.
In the case of low-end innovations that move solely
down market—like the rebar produced by the minimill makers—it cannot be true that the established
ﬁrms failed to respond effectively because they did not
understand the needs of their customers. The steel
ﬁrms knew that, all other things equal, their customers would like cheaper steel. So they must have chosen
not to respond to the mini-mills for one of the reasons
outlined already: either they believed they could not
effectively develop the appropriate technical competencies; or they did not believe the mini-mills would
ever be able to compete effectively against them; or
they were captured—rationally or irrationally—by
their existing margins. In new-market disruptions, a
different explanation may be at work. Consider, for
example, the case of chocolate confectionery and the
energy bar.
Chocolate confectionery is an old industry dominated in the United States by two private ﬁrms, Hersheys and Masterfoods USA, and by Nestle, the
European giant. Chocolate bars are sold through
mass food outlets, small mom-and-pop retailers, and
other convenience stores. The industry is characterized by intense competition and relatively high rates
of product introduction but is also believed to be
reasonably profitable. The big brands, including
Hershey’s Kisses and Masterfood’s Snickers, have
dominated the market for many years.
The ﬁrst commercially produced energy bar—the
PowerBar—was introduced in 1986 as a nutritional
supplement for athletes. It sold well, and over the next
20 years a variety of ﬁrms entered the industry. Energy bars moved gradually into mass-market food outlets as designed for general consumption. Although
revenue numbers are not available either for massmarket confectionery or energy bars, my best guess
(extrapolating from the relative shelf space at my local
supermarket) is that energy bars have yet to approach
confectionery sales in volume, and it is probably too
early to tell if energy bars are disruptive innovations
in Christensen’s (1997) sense. My focus here, however,
is this: If they were, what barriers might be in the way
of the incumbent ﬁrms recognizing the nature of the
threat they pose and taking action?
Pulling apart this relatively simple example yields
insight into the kinds of market-facing competencies
I believe may be why established ﬁrms have difﬁculty

responding to disruptive innovation. First, it seems
unlikely that energy bars will follow the classic
‘‘Christensen’’ path (Figure 1). On the dominant
measure of performance in the confectionery business—taste—energy bars do not perform well at all,
and it seems to be a stretch to believe they will ever
taste as good as conventional candy.
Another way into the problem is to construct a
simple market map, with the critical performance dimension for the existing product on the vertical axis
and the performance dimension dominated by the
disruptive technology on the other. Such a map deﬁnes the conventional chocolate bar and the energy
bar as at least initially selling into two separate markets, meeting two different combinations of needs: a
market in which consumers are willing to trade off (1)
perceived nutritional value for taste; and (2) taste for
perceived nutritional value (Figure 2).
It is conceivable, of course, that the taste of energy
bars will improve so significantly they will move to the

upper-right-hand quadrant of this diagram, and ex
post Christensen’s diagram could be drawn (Figure 3).
But such a move seems unlikely in the short term. A
more plausible scenario is that customer preferences
may shift; that is, consumers who have historically
been willing to sacriﬁce nutrition for taste will become
increasingly reluctant to do so, and the market itself,
or the bulk of customer preferences, will move to the
bottom right of the diagram (Figure 4).
I have come to believe that many disruptive innovations have exactly this characteristic. They come to
reshape the pattern of preferences in a market, and
this is particularly difﬁcult for established ﬁrms to respond to effectively for reasons that ﬂow directly from
the nature of the embedded organizational competencies of the ﬁrm.
Suppose, for example, that the confectionery companies had attempted to understand the threat posed
by energy bars when they were ﬁrst introduced by

doing market research with their best customers. My
guess is that their most loyal customers, who happen
to be adolescent males, would almost certainly have
responded badly to the energy bar (local experiments
have produced responses like ‘‘Take this away; it
tastes like cardboard’’), since by definition a ﬁrm’s
best customers are likely those who place the most
value on the dominant performance metrics of the
current product, which is one of Christensen’s (1997)
central points. This could be a problem of shortsightedness or inertia, of being overly enamoured of existing
margins. Or it could be the case that in order to understand the appeal of the energy bar, the confectionery companies needed to understand an entirely
different market segment (initially athletes, and later
nutritionally aware older consumers), in what might
ultimately prove to be nothing but a niche market.
Levinthal and his collaborators (Levinthal, 1997;
Rivkin, 2001) recently suggested that it may be helpful
to think of organizational inertia as being driven by
processes of local search over bumpy landscapes.
Viewed from this perspective, established, successful
ﬁrms develop highly effective routines for searching
around their local peak: They build a rich understanding of their current customers, for example, and
invest heavily in distribution systems to reach them.
Such ﬁrms usually develop not only deeply embedded
cognitive models and shared systems of understanding
(e.g., ‘‘In general, our customers view our product as
an indulgence or a treat’’) but also deeply embedded
systems of incentives that reinforce, and are in turn
reinforced by, the local experience of the ﬁrm (Kaplan
and Henderson, 2005).
Exploring a new, possibly disruptive, market thus
requires major changes in patterns of behavior and
search (Danneels, 2002). Given that many new markets do not prove to be profitable and that it takes
time to learn about them, any degree of real uncertainly may plausibly make such distant search unprofitable on an expected value basis. To the degree
that processes of resource allocation within the ﬁrm
are driven by current customers, this problem will be
compounded, but even in the absence of this issue one
can readily construct models in which rational ﬁrms
will continue to search locally and to concentrate on
their existing markets.
Much in Christensen and Raynor’s (2003) recent
book, the Innovator’s Solution, is consistent with this
hypothesis. In the book, Christensen lays considerable
stress on techniques ﬁrms can use to understand newmarket opportunities. He discusses, for example, how

<-----Page 5----->10

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:5–11

consumers ‘‘hire’’ products to perform ‘‘jobs’’ for
them and how a deep understanding of these jobs
can guide new product development. Indeed, the book
can be seen as laying out tools and techniques that will
help ﬁrms develop the customer-facing competencies
to enable them to respond to disruptive innovation
and is thus quite consistent with the hypothesis that it
is the lack of exactly these kinds of competencies that
creates problems in the ﬁrst place.
The book’s explanation for why ﬁrms fail to use
these and other innovative techniques is not completely convincing, though. Christensen and Raynor (2003)
suggest, for example, that Sony’s failure to move effectively into new markets after the founder’s departure was a function of ‘‘MBAs who brought with
them sophisticated, quantitative, attribute-based techniques for segmenting markets and assessing market
potential’’ (p. 80) rather than the deep intuition guiding early product development at the ﬁrm. Such an
explanation again focuses on the senior team’s failure
to understand the underlying nature of disruptive innovation—rather than on the fact that in established
ﬁrms it is much easier and more reliable to understand
customer behavior in existing markets.
For the confectionery companies, for example,
building an understanding of the potential of the energy bar required a deep understanding of consumers
largely peripheral to their current business. Moreover,
it required revisiting deeply held assumptions about the
nature of their products. Confectionery companies do
not, by and large, think of their products as unhealthy;
indeed, careful examination of the ingredients list on a
typical energy bar reveals little evidence to support the
idea that it is any better for the body than a Hershey’s
chocolate bar. The appeal of the energy bar is almost
certainly much more about the perception of nutrition
than the reality. And understanding this requires arriving at the uncomfortable reality that for some consumers eating a candy bar in public is something they
would rather not do.
Understanding these kinds of deep shifts in consumer behavior is notoriously difﬁcult. There is, after
all, a vibrant literature about how difﬁcult it is to understand previously unarticulated consumer needs;
viewed from this perspective, disruptive innovation
creates problems because it makes obsolete what one
might call customer-facing competence in subtle ways
that may be very difﬁcult to anticipate. Deep knowledge about customer preferences almost certainly becomes embedded in the organizational routines of a
ﬁrm and is mediated by the nature of the value net-

R. HENDERSON

work in which the ﬁrm is embedded. In the confectionary case, for example, energy bars were sold ﬁrst
through specialist sports outlets, not through the
outlets from which the confectionary companies
were accustomed to learn, so that for the chocolate
companies identifying shifts in customer behavior—
and building new product offerings that better
matched new preferences—was a classic problem in
competence destruction.

Conclusion
Christensen’s (1997) concept of disruptive innovation
has had a dramatic effect on both practice and scholarly research. It has reminded us of just how difﬁcult
it can be for an established ﬁrm to respond to significant shifts in the environment, throwing into high
relief problems of cognitive framing and resource allocation. In my view it also makes another critical
contribution: It highlights the role of market-facing
competence in shaping a ﬁrm’s response to disruptive
innovation, opening up an important new ﬁeld for
future research.
