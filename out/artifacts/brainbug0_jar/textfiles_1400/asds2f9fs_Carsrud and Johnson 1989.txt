of leadership hold great promise.

to the field has not yet matured Future research using more sophisticated behavioral
modeLr will have significant impact on the undentrrnding of the development of
e n t r e p r e d behaviors.

Current state of the art
Research in quest of a paradigm

Entrepreneurship, although ancient in practice, is new as a field of scientific study. The
current status of entrepreneurship research reflects a preparadigmatic tliscipline that is
searching for identity and respectability (Carsrud, Olm,& Eddy, 1986b; Vesper, 1987).
Entrepreneurship research is at a stage similar to that previously identified with other
behavioral-based phenomena such as "management policy," "organizational behavior,"
or "social psychology" (Koch, 1959). We are approaching entrepreneurship from a
social psychological perspective because it can be viewed as social behavior.
Inadequate transfer of theories

'

The advancement of entrepreneurship research has been inhibited by the indiscriminate
transfer of methodologies and theories from other disciplines (Carsrud et al., 1986b).
Whereas this "transfer of technology" is uSeful, it often has not been successful. For
example, Brockhaus and Horwia (1986) note that the overall results of the psychological studies of entrepreneurs have been disappointing. There are four possible reasons for
the lack of success in adapting psychological theories to entrepreneurship.
1. Assumption of srable characteristics. The first reason for unsucct:ssful transfer is
an assumption held by many theories. Most theories have traditionally fixused on stable
characteristics of entrepreneurs, and stable groups and organizations that were neither
new, nor in a state of flux and change (Begley.and Boyd. 1987). However, entrepreneurial behavior is a dynamic ever-changing process that is usually evidenceti in situations of
instability and changes (Carsrud, 1987).
2. Poor application of knowledge. Another reason for the disappointing performance of psychological theories is the tendency to misapply them (C;usrud, Olm, &
Thomas, 1984; Carsrud et al., 1986b). For example, McClelland's (1961) work on
achievement motivation continues to influence entrepreneurship research. However, McClelland's unidimensional approach has long since been replaced by more sophisticated

<-----Page 2----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 03:03 4 September 2010

A. L. CARSRUD and R. W.JOHNSON

multidimensional models and measures of achievement motivation (Spence &
Helmreich, 1978; Carsrud et al., 1984, 1986b; Carsrud & Olm, 1986; Helmreich,
Sawin, & Carsrud, 1986; Carsrud, Olm, Dodd, & Gaglio, 1987).
Researchers in social psychology have conducted extensive investigations into the
relationships between personality and social behaviors (Snyder & Ickes. 1985). Researchers in entrepreneurship, on the other hand, often have made naive and simplistic
assumptions about the relationships between personality and social behaviors. An example of such a naive assumption comes from the early work of McClelland (1961). He
concludes that achievement motivation drives people to become entrepreneurs.
Research has found that entrepreneurs are high achievers, but it has also been found
that successful executives are also high achievers. Motivation alone does not seem to be
an effective differential variable between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs. In addition, the causal direction is unclear and does little to help us understand entrepreneurial
behaviors. That is, successful performance may contribute to high need for achievement.
rather than a high need for achievement contributing to success. The fact that the casual
direction is unclear suggests that achievement motivation alone is not a sufficient explanation for the drive to become an entrepreneur. To conclude that achievement motivation
drives people to become entrepreneurs would be a naive assumption. A more likely
interpretation is that motivation has a general causal effect on any type of performance
success.
3. Conficsion of levels of analysis. The third reason that psychological approaches
have not met expectations may relate to levels of analysis. Current research typically
does not integrate both "micro" and "macro" level variables into the study of the
process of new venture creation. For example, the "macro" level variables of social
networks and socialization influence the "micro" level variables of the entrepreneur's
"personality" and oven behaviors. Only a few studies have related "macro" level
variables of social context, such as industry structure with "micro" level variables such
as the individual entrepreneur (Sandberg & Hofer. 1987).
4. Lack of systemuric research. Indicative of the lack of systematic research in
entrepreneurship is the dearth of adequate operational definitions in the field. For examples, the conceptual argument on the differences between small business and entrepreneurship (Cariand, Hoy, Boulton, & Carland, 1984) is reminiscent of "how many angels
can dance on the head of a pin." This argument would be irrelevant if global operational
definitions were routinely applied by researchers. The recent work of Brockhaus (1987)
and his collaborators on developing mutually agreed upon measures of research populations may facilitate the development of much needed systematic research.

Broadening the psychological perspective
To abandon a psychological perspective as a part of the research repertoire would ignore
several useful contemporary theories. It would also ignore significant advances in research methodology. If the focus is on entrepreneurial behaviors and related social stimuli, then entrepreneurship is clearly a social psychological phenomena.
A social psychological approach could provide significant and meaningful advancements in entrepreneurship research through the adaptation of welldeveloped and sup-

<-----Page 3----->A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE

ported theories. Any adoption of social psychological theory also requir'es the adoption
of related sophisticated research methodologies (Dawes & Smith, 1985; Kenny, 1985;
Schuman & Kalton, 1985). Thls paper is an attempt to transfer the theoretical approaches developed in social psychology to the study of entrepreneurid behaviors in
their social contexts. This paper does not focus on methodological issues, but more on
empirically based theory.

A social definition of entrepreneurship

Take as a set of assumptions that entrepreneurial behaviors are most prevalent in unstable, socioeconomic environments, particularly in new ventures and those organizations
adapting to rapid change. In addition, assume that these behaviors are characterized by
the pursuit of opportunities in resource-poor situations where the creation of value is a
goal. Individuals who are opportunity driven and capable of identifying g:rowing markets
exhibit entrepreneurial behaviors. Finally assume that such behaviors are elicited most
frequently whenever the environment is most congenial (Duffy & Stevenson, 1984;
Stevenson, Roberts, & Grousbeck, 1985). Therefore, entrepreneurial behaviors can occur in a variety of contexts, not just in the business setting itself.
Entrepreneurial behaviors frequently occur within organizational contexts that are
resource tense or strained (Cooper, 1985; Carsrud, 1987; Peterson, 1987). Thus entrepreneurship research could provide significant input into the study of small group behavior and behaviors in larger organizations from the little studied perspective of highly
unstable and unstructured groups (Pfeffer, 1985).
Social context of entrepreneurial behaviors

The social context in which entrepreneurial behaviors occur includes role-sets (Aldrich
& Zimrner, 1986). which are components of social relationships that occur by virtue of
an individual occupying a particdm social status. The entrepreneur's role-set may include family members, venture capitalists. bankers, partners, and distributors. The entrepreneur's behaviors are significantly influenced by the networks of which they are a
part. This is especially true when members of the entrepreneur's role-set have conflicting expectations, since the individual will have to adapt his or her behavior to meet these
differing expectations.
Various behavioral strategies are employed by the entrepreneur in fulfilling ths role.
As the focal person in the role-set, these strategies influence the survival of the business
venture. Also as the focal person in the role-set, the entrepreneur deper~dson information and resources provided by social networks.
Role-set and social influence may strongly effect entrepreneurs throul;h susceptibility
to "group think" (Janis, 1972). For example, entrepreneurs may surround themselves
with management teams that are "yes men." These individuals may Nter any disconfirming information related to decision making before it is considered. Such a process
may facilitate group cohesiveness among the members of the start-up team, but jeopardize the venture by increasing poor decision making. Thus the study of management
teams and their effect on success in emerging industries ( V m y & Ibhman, 1986)
could be conceptualized in terms of "groupthink" and social influence.

Social nerworh: know-who versus kn0.w-how
Carsrud, Gaglio, and Olm (1987) assume that entrepreneurial behaviors are highly determined by social situations, rather than determined by macro-level variables such as
economic conditions or political climate. The innovation component of that development
is the linkage of key resources. The study of those linkages from a network analysis
perspective should provide information about the social processes that are most significant in successful new venture development.
The new venture development process is strongly affected by social contacts, or
linkages, which are the patterns of social interaction with significant human resources.
The entrepreneur is embedded in a complex set of social networks that either facilitate or
inhibit venture development through linkages between the entrepreneur and required
resources and available economic opportunities. In social situations, these resources can
be seen as being various persons who have skills, information, or control over materials
or capital funds that are necessary for the success of the new venture.
Conceptually, a strong situational determinant in entrepreneurial behaviors should be
the density of the contacts or linkages. These contacts include not only direct contacts,
but other networks in which these contacts are members. This phenomena could be
called the "strength of weak ties." From such diverse contacts the entrepreneur should
be able to gather the necessary resources and information to assure the successful development and growth of a new venture. These would include finding product-service
ideas, access to new technology, transfer of technology, capital funds, current market
data, and appraisal of the relevant competition. It is these direct and indirect contacts
that contribute to the development and success of the new venture.
Despite the potentially salient role of networks, their effect may not always be easily
identified. For example, in asking entrepreneurs to recount their successes and failures.
it is not uncommon for them to emphasize the "know-how" aspects of starting or
running a business rather than the "know-who." Peterson and Ronstadt (1987) refer to
entrepreneurial "know-how" as possessing the particular skills, traits, or business
knowledge for entrepreneurship. "Know-who" describes an entrepreneur who demonstrates the power of having access to the right contacts at the right time.
Networks may not uniformly be used by the entrepreneur. Carsrud and coworkers
(1987) found networks to be unrelated to the success of the initiation process. but potentially very important to success in the growth phase. It is clear that the role of networks
has yet to be adequately researched in the study of the successes and failures of entrepreneurial ventures (Birley, 1985).
Nevertheless, entrepreneurial networks increasingly have been associated with success. Entrepreneurs count on these contacts and connections to cut comers, to pave the
way for acceptance, and enhance image and credibility (Mitton. 1984). These contacts
can also provide information and support, help avoid costly time-consuming errors and
research, and help locate resources. Such contacts also block or slow down adversaries.
Entrepreneurs constantly maintain these relationships to be called upon when needed to
provide information and assistance (Birley, 1985).
Peterson and Ronstadt (1987) propose a silent strength explanation for the tendency
of entrepreneurs to avoid talking about their personal networks in terms of their successes and failures. The entrepreneur may wish for these contacts to remain confidential,
because if revealed, the strength of the network with these people may be weakened. It is
also possible that the entrepreneur does not emphasize the importance of his or her
networks because the individual wants to receive credit for the business's success in

<-----Page 5----->A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECINE

terms of innate abiIity and sliilIs (know-how) rather than,at&buting success to "knowwho". This attributional process has been extensively studied by social psychologists
(Ross & Fletcher. 1985). Incorporating both "know-how" and "know-who" provides
the entrepreneur with a broad perspective that places environment, people, events, information, and technology into understandable and manipulative perspective (Minon.
1984).

Social influence and entrepreneurship

Funhermore, there are both cognitive and social influences on entrepre:neurial behaviors. Risk-taking propensity is a cognitive factor that influences human behavior (Peacock, 1986). Risk-taking propensity refers to the predisposition to behave, whereas risktaking (referred to earlier) refers to the actual behavior. Social factors influence both
cognitions and information processing related to roleenactment (Aldrich & Zimmer.
1986). The entrepreneurial role is embedded in a social context. Fulfilling this role is
facilitated or constrained by people's positions in social networks, role expectations, and
social pressures to conform (Moscovici, 1985). Understanding confornlity and social
influence is important in discerning potential limitations on the exhibition of entrepreneurial behaviors.
Impression management: the entrepreneurial image

An example of how social influence impacts entrepreneurial behavior comes from impression management research on the self-evaluation process and behavioral selfregulation. Central to impression management theory is a person's exp:rience of self,
which often takes the form of imagining how the entrepreneur would be perceived and
responded to by significant others such as bankers, investors, and employees (Baldwin &
Hoirnes. 1987).
Impression management focuses on the public presentation of the self ,topeople in the
environment. Impression management also involves the internal representation of the
self by imagining the reactions of others. People act in ways to uphold! their sense of
acceptance by others. Social psychological research supports the idea tha.t the behaviors
of people who focus on publicly observable aspects of self tend to conform to the
evaluative standards of this public audience (Carver & Scheier, 1981). Ib the entrepreneur acceptance and recognition by others may lead to the attainment of resources that
are useful to the entrepreneur. How much the entrepreneur conforms to stxietal expectations may be critical to the ultimate success of a business venture.
Another interpretation of the entrepreneur's reluctance to stress the significance of
social networks (Peterson & Ronstadt, 1987) also stems from the prillciples of selfpresentation and impression management. Societal norms and expectatiorls for the entrepreneur may tend to be biased against networking and may make the entrepreneur feel
guilty about expressing "know-who" rather than "know-how" (Peterson & Ronstadt,
1987). To avoid this response bias by others, the entrepreneur often presents an image of
the competent business person, emphasizing skills and knowledge utiiiztxl in becoming
successful. When an entrepreneur presents an image, he or she makes a commitment to
live up to that image (Schlenker, 1980). By failing to do so, the entrepreneur risks losing
the networks.
People's self-presentations are responsive to making a favorable imp]-ession on society, so that the social attitude will be one of promotion of entreprer~eurialgrowth.

Violating the societal norms might have the effect of changing the public's attitude
toward the entrepreneur from one of approval to dsapproval.

Equitable exchange: managing a favorable impression

One strategy the entrepreneur uses to preserve impressions once created is described by
equity theory of social relationships (Markus & Zajonc. 1985). The entrepreneur manages a favorable impression with networks by continually making the network members
feel that they are in an equitable relationship with the entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurs, like all individuals, are intermeshed in a social matrix in which their
outcomes are interlinked (Schlenker, 1980). In other words, when people interact, their
actions and behaviors have consequences for themselves as well as for others. Interdependence of outcomes is characteristic of such interaction: outcomes received are derived from the interplay of one's own behaviors and those of others (Schlenker, 1980).
Reciprocity and social exchange occur in social interactions with others. This exchange involves the reciprocation of tangible or intangible outcomes that are seen as
valuable. Outcomes involve both rewards and costs, and a profit is yielded when costs
are subtracted from rewards for each participant. It is these exchanges that are the basis
of networking by entrepreneurs.
Exchange theory as proposed by social psychologists holds that all people, not just
entrepreneurs. want to maximize profits from interactions (Schlenker, 1980). If profits
are high, the entrepreneur will be satisfied. If the profits are low, relative to what could
be obtained in an alternative relationship, the entrepreneur is likely to leave. The pattern
also applies to those individuals who are a part of the entrepreneur's network. By managing the impression of an equitable relationship, the entrepreneur will be more likely to
maintain the network. Different impressions must be managed with different audiences
and at different stages of firm development.
In equity theory the exchange of goods and/or services (sometimes referred to as
rewards) between two people must be equitable for both parties. This equity is not unlike
the "win-win" strategies frequently proposed by entrepreneurs in "cutting a deal" with
business associates. Likewise, the costs for either party should not outweigh the rewards
that are received. That is, the proportion of rewards over costs for one person is equal to
the proportion of reward over costs for the other person. This idea of equity in personal
networks was implied by Peterson and Ronstadt (1987) when they stated that an entrepreneur should utilize a network with the understanding that it is a "two-way street." It
should also be noted that the maintenance of equity in relationships extends far beyond
the principle of impression management. Equity is a critical dimension influencing the
formation and stability of many relationships.
l3e entrepreneur and role theory

The more the entrepreneur fulfills role expectations. the more likely the individual will
be to succeed in that venture (Sexton & Bowman, 1985; Sexton, 1986). Thus the study
of social norms, mores, and values is an effective avenue of research investigation with.
respect to the initiation and growth of new ventures @ion. 1985; Spence, Deaux. &
Helrnreich, 1985; Suyker & Statham, 1985).
An example of how attitudes and norms influence the role of the entrepreneur comes
from reported differences between male and female entrepreneurs in the United States.

report statistics that female"~ntrepreneurs,until recently, were not as successful as male
entrepreneurs.
One explanation is that women entrepreneurs generally have less experience and
specialized education than male entrepreneurs. Another explanation may be that females
stan businesses that may not be counted, such as their own consulting :practices. Contemporary research on sex-role orientation may provide some useful insights into the
differential rates of new venture initiation in males and females (Spence: & Helrnreich,
1978; Spence er al., 1985). For example, the observed educational difference may reflect a social attitude or norm opposed to women obtaining specialized! education and
training in business. There is strong evidence to indicate that such a widely held view
has been prevalent in the past (Hisrich, 1986).
The exhibition of entrepreneurial behaviors would be mtluencea by tn~esoclu acceptance of those behaviors. Even if women had a strong desire to fulfd the entrepreneurial
role to its fullest, the societal norm toward women in this role woultl have made it
difficult for them to achieve success in the role of an entrepreneur since they may lack
the necessary know-how that would have been available to them through training and
education (Carsrud, Olm, & Ahlgren, 1986a). Research in adult socialization process
may provide some interesting insight into this phenomena (Dion, 1985).
Role conflict: entrepreneur versus manager

Research on role conflict may also be useful in the study of the changes tllat occur during
life phases of the entrepreneurial venture. For example, the entrepreneur may experience conflict due to role-transition as a part of achieving company growth (Sexton &
Bowman, 1985; Stevenson et al., 1985). As resources increase, a new role identity
emerges: the role of "resource manager." The entrepreneur must moclify the existing
dominant role and associated behaviors to ensure the maintenance of the business (Sexton & Bowman, 1985; Sexton. 1986).
One way the entrepreneur adjusts behaviors to the emerging managerial role is by
learning new behaviors such as the delegation of authority and responsibilities. Because
of role conflict, contradictory behaviors may interfere with the fulfillment of new role
demands such as delegating authority. Role conflict may result from the unwillingness to
delegate responsibility and thereby contribute to the downfall of the business venture.
Multiple role involvement may also offer benefits as well as costs. One benefit might
be access to multiple segments of society. These different segments may offer network
assets that include resources, monetary and nonmonetary (i.e., prestige) rewards, as
well as contributions to personal growth and development (Hirsch & Rapkin, 1986).
The entrepreneur's health and well-being is affected by the membcrs of the social
network. Role partners such as one's spouse, clients, and business associates help shape
role expectations and behaviors (Hirsch & Rapkin, 1986). These role p:mers may also
provide or withhold emotional support andor material goods that can assist the fulfillment of role tasks and help reduce the amount of conflict experienced. In other words.
networks, both personal and business, can help or hinder the enactment of businessrelated roles. Thus social networks help to define, influence, and evaluate entrepreneurial behaviors (Carsrud et al., 1987).
Knowledge and enactment of appropriate roles are important for entrepreneurial
success. Roles act as social scripts that dictate how one should behave. Roles give
direction and purpose to a person's behavior (Stryker & Statham, 1985). In assuming the
role of enwpreneur, people must be able to adapt to the set of behaviors that are

<-----Page 8----->28

associated with this entrepreneurial role. Becoming an ownerlmanager is a roletransition in itself, since the educational system often prepares individuals for entry level
positions in larger businesses, rather than considering starting a business as a viable
alternative (Sexton & Bowman, 1985; Sexton, 1986; Carsrud et al., 1986a).

Alternative approaches to entrepreneurship research

Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 03:03 4 September 2010

A contingency theory of entrepreneurship

The trend in entrepreneurship research seems to follow the historical trends in leadership
research. In the early stages of leadership research, the focus was on trait approaches.
This approach to research proved to be less informative than expected. The recent move
in entrepreneurship research to the study of leadershiplike behaviors and a situational
.
approach likewise follows the research history of leadership (Hollander, 1985).
If this parallel is correct, one can anticipate the next stages in the theory-research
cycle. For example, as an outgrowth of the situational approach to leadership, there
developed a series of contingency models that attempted to specify the factors that made
various leader qualities effective given certain contingencies.
In short, contingency theories of entrepreneurship behavior would emphasize those
environmental conditions that elicit different entrepreneurial attributes for effectiveness.
For example. Carsrud et al. (1986a) have proposed a path-analytic model viewing the
effects of personality and motivational variables as they would be mediated by various
organizational and situational factors that effect the ultimate success of the business
venture.

A transactional theory of entrepreneurship

Another model derived from the leadership research tradition is the transactional model
of behavior (Hollander, 1985). As we have argued up to this point, one can perceive of
entrepreneurship behaviors as being social in nature and involving relationships of the
entrepreneur with others in the environment. Transactional models of leadership stress
the two-way interaction of leaders and followers. Certainly, similar patterns exist in
entrepreneurial interactions with lawyers, banks, and employees. Transactional models
take into account the perceptions and counterperceptions involved.
Although the transactional approach has typically focused on stable organizations, or
laboratory created groups, the approach signifies a more active role by those in the
social environment than other models. If one extrapolates this model to entrepreneurship, the phenomena becomes an exchange relationship with two-way influence between
the entrepreneur and other individuals.
Thus entrepreneurial behaviors are not only situationally influenced, as in the contingency model, but also influenced by social interactions in which the entrepreneur is
placed. A transactional model may be a bridging paradigm in entrepreneurship research
between the traditional leadership literature in social psychology and the network analysis literature in sociology.

Conclusions
Entrepreneurship research will best be advanced by identifying other areas of scientific
investigation that have followed similar patterns and strategies, or deal with similar
behaviors. Thus more productive models, theories, and technologies can be transferred
to the study of entrepreneurship. Research paradigms such as the contingency and transactional models of leadership hold great promise in furthering entrepl-eneurship research.
Entrepreneurial behaviors, like all human behaviors, are complexly dletermined and
their study requires models that do justice to the complexity and richness of the entrepreneurial behaviors being exhibited. The social psychological approach to the study of
entrepreneurship has yet to reach maturity. Future results using more sophisticated
models wiLl have more significant impact on entrepreneurship than other behavioral
approaches previously undertaken in the study of entrepreneurship.
