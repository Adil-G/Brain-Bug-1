Sequential Decision Making
Sequential decision making describes a situation where
the decision maker (DM) makes successive observations of a process before a ﬁnal decision is made, in
contrast to dynamic decision making (see Dynamic
Decision Making) which is more concerned with
controlling a process over time.
Formally a sequential decision problem is deﬁned,
such that the DM can take observations X , X ,… one
" DM
#
at a time. After each observation Xn the
can
decide to terminate the process and make a ﬁnal
decision from a set of decisions D, or continue the
process and take the next observation Xn+ . If the
observations X , X ,… form a random "sample,
# sequential sampling.
the procedure is"called
In most sequential decision problems there is an
implicit or explicit cost associated with each observation. The procedure to decide when to stop taking
observations and when to continue is called the
stopping rule. The objective in sequential decision
making is to ﬁnd a stopping rule that optimizes the
13917

<-----Page 1----->Sequential Decision Making
decision in terms of minimizing losses or maximizing
gains including observation costs. The optimal stopping rule is also called the optimal strategy or the
optimal policy.
A wide variety of sequential decision problems have
been discussed in the statistics literature, including
search problems, inventory problems, gambling problems, and secretary-type problems, including sampling
with and without recall. Several methods have been
proposed to solve the optimization problem under
speciﬁed conditions, including dynamic programming,
Markov chains, and Bayesian analysis.
In the psychological literature, sequential decision
problems are better known as optional stopping problems. One line of research using sequential decision
making is concerned with seeking information in
situations such as buying houses, searching for a job
candidate, price searching, or target search. The DM
continues taking observations until a decision criterion
for acceptance is reached. Another line of research
applies sequential decision making to account for
information processing in binary choice tasks (see
Diﬀusion and Random Walk Processes; Stochastic
Dynamic Models (Choice, Response, and Time)), and
hypothesis testing such as in signal detection tasks (see
Signal Detection Theory: Multidimensional). The DM
continues taking observations until either of two
decision criteria is reached. Depending on the particular research area, observations are also called oﬀers,
options, items, applicants, information, and the like.
Observation costs include explicitly not only possibly
money, but also time, eﬀort, aggravation, discomfort,
and so on.
Contrary to the objective of statisticians or economists, psychologists are less interested in determining
the optimal stopping rule, and more interested in
discussing the variables that aﬀect human decision
behavior in sequential decision tasks. Optimal decision
strategies are considered as normative models, and
their predictions are compared to actual choice behavior.

1. Sequential Decision Making with One Decision
Criterion
In sequential decision making with one decision
criterion the DM takes costly observations Xn, n l
1,… of a random process one at a time. After observing
Xn l xn the DM has to decide whether to continue
sampling observations or to stop. In the former case,
the observation Xn+ is taken at a cost of cn+ ; in the
"
"
latter case the DM receives
a net payoﬀ that consists
of
the payoﬀ minus the observation costs. The DM’s
objective is to ﬁnd a stopping rule that maximizes the
expected net payoﬀ.
The optimal stopping rule depends on the speciﬁc
assumptions made about the situation: (a) the dis13918

tribution of X is known, not known or partly known,
(b) Xi are distributed identically for all i, or have the
similar distribution but with diﬀerent parameters, or
have diﬀerent distributions, (c) the number of possible
observations, n, is bounded or unbounded, (d) the
sampling procedure, e.g., it is possible to take the
highest value observed so far when stopping (sampling
with recall) or only to take the last value when stopping
(sampling without recall), and (e) the cost function, cn,
is ﬁxed for each observation or is a function of n. Many
of these problems have been studied theoretically by
mathematicians and experimentally by psychologists.
Pioneering experimental work was done in a series of
papers by Rapoport and colleagues (1966, 1969, 1970,
1972).

1.1 Unknown Sample Distribution: Secretary-type
Problems
Kahan et al. (1967) investigated decision behavior in a
sequential search task where the DM had to ﬁnd the
largest of a set of n l 200 numbers, observed one at a
time from a deck of cards. The observations were
taken in random order without replacement. The DM
could only declare the current observation as the
largest number (sampling without recall), and could
compare the number with the previous presented
numbers. No explicit cost for each observation was
taken, i.e., c l 0. The sample distribution was unknown to the DM. A reward was paid only when the
card with the highest number was selected, and
nothing otherwise. This describes a decision situation
that is known as the secretary problem (a job candidate
search problem; for various other names, see, e.g.,
Freeman 1983) which, in its simplest form, makes
explicit the following assumptions (Ferguson 1989):
(a) only one position is available, (b) the number n of
applicants is known, (c) applicants are interviewed
sequentially in random order, each order being equally
likely, and (d) all applicants can be ranked without
ties—the decision to reject or accept an applicant must
be based only on the relative ranks of the applicants
interviewed so far, (e) an applicant once rejected
cannot later be recalled, and (f ) the payoﬀ is 1 when
choosing the best of the n applicants, 0 otherwise.
The optimal strategy for this kind of problem is to
reject the ﬁrst sk1, s  1, items (cards, applicants,
draws) and then choose the ﬁrst item that is best in the
relative ranking so far. With

the optimal strategy is to stop if as 1 and to continue if
as  1, which can easily be determined for small n. For
large n, the probability of choosing the best item is

<-----Page 2----->Sequential Decision Making
approximated by 1\e and the optimal s by n\e. (e l
2.71…). (For derivations, see, e.g., DeGroot 1970,
Freeman 1983, Gilbert and Mosteller 1966).
Kahan et al. (1967) reported that about 40 percent
of their subjects did not follow the optimal strategy
but stopped too late and rejected a card that should
have been accepted. The failure of the strategy for
describing behavior was assigned to its inadequacy for
the described task. Although at the beginning of the
experiment the participants did not know anything
about the distribution (requirement), they could learn
about the distribution by taking observations (partly
information). To guarantee ignorance of the distribution, Gilbert and Mosteller (1966) recommended
supplying only the rank of the observation made so far
and not the actual value. Seale and Rapoport (1997)
conducted an experiment following this advice. They
found that participants (with n l 40 and n l 80)
stopped earlier than prescribed by the optimal stopping rule. They proposed simple decision rules or
heuristics to describe the actual choice behavior. Using
a cutoﬀ rule, the DM rejects the ﬁrst sk1 applicants
and then chooses the next top-ranked applicant, i.e.,
the candidate. The DM simply counts the number of
applicants and then stops on the ﬁrst candidate after
observing sk1 applicants. Under a candidate count
rule, the DM counts the number of candidates and
chooses the j th candidate. A successive non-candidate
rule requires the DM to choose the ﬁrst candidate after
observing at least k consecutive noncandidates following the last candidate.
The secretary problem has been extended and
generalized in many diﬀerent directions within the
mathematical statistics ﬁeld. Each of the above assumptions has been relaxed in one way or another.
(Ferguson 1989, Freeman 1983). However, the label of
secretary problem tends to be used only when the
distribution is unknown and the decision to stop or to
continue depends only on the relative ranking of the
observations taken so far and not on their actual
values.

1.2 Known Sample Distribution
Rapoport and Tversky (1966, 1970) investigated
choice behavior when the mean and the variance of the
distribution was known to the DM. The cost for each
observation was ﬁxed but the amount varied across
experimental conditions, and the number of possible
observations n was unbounded (1966) or bounded and
known (1970). Behavior for sampling with and without recall was compared. When sampling is without
recall only the value of the last observation, Xn l xn,
can be received, and the payoﬀ is this value minus the
total sampling cost, i.e, xnkcn. The optimal strategy is
to ﬁnd a stopping rule that maximizes the expected
payoﬀ E(XNkcN). When sampling is with recall, the
highest value observed so far can be selected and the

payoﬀ is max(x ,…, xn)kcn and the optimal strategy
is to ﬁnd a" stopping rule that maximizes
E(max(X ,…, XN)kcN). In the following,  with
subscripts" and * denote the expected gain from an
(optimal) procedure.

1.2.1 Number of Obserations Unbounded. If n is unbounded, i.e., if the number of observations that can
be taken is unlimited, and X , X … are sampled from
" F(x),
# the optimal strata known distribution function
egy is the same for both sampling with and without
recall. In particular, the optimal strategy is to continue to take observations whenever the observed
value xj *, and to stop taking observations as
soon as an observed value xj  *, where * is the
unique solution of

When the observations are taken from a standard
normal distribution with density functions φ(x) and
distribution function Φ(x), we have that

1kΦ(*)

(3)

Although sampling with and without recall have the
same solution, they seem to be diﬀerent from a
psychological point of view. Rapoport and Tversky
(1966) found that the group sampling without recall
took signiﬁcantly fewer observations than the participants sampling with recall. The mean number of
observations for both groups decreased with increasing cost c, and the diﬀerence with respect to the
number of observations taken was diminished. However, the participants in both groups took fewer
observations than prescribed by the optimal strategy.
This nonoptimal behavior of the participants was
attributed to a lack of thorough knowledge of the
distributions.
1.2.2 Number of Obserations Bounded. If n, n  2,
is bounded, i.e., if not more than n observations can
be taken, the optimal stopping rules for sampling
with and without recall are diﬀerent. For sampling
without recall, an optimal procedure is to continue
taking observations whenever xj n−jkc and to
stop as soon as xj  n−jkc, where j l 1, 2… n indicates the number of observations which remain available and

For sampling" with recall, the optimal strategy is to
continue the process whenever a value xj * and to
stop taking observations as soon as an observed value
xj  *, where * is as in Eqn. (2), which is the same
solution as for n unbounded. (For derivations of the
strategies, see DeGroot 1970, Sakaguchi 1961.)
Rapoport and Tversky (1970) investigated choice
behavior within this scenario. Sampling was done
both with and without recall. The number of observations that could be taken as well as observation cost
varied across experimental groups. One third of the
participants did not follow the optimal strategy. Under
both sampling procedures and all cost conditions, they
took on average fewer observations than predicted by
the corresponding optimal stopping rules. There were
no systematic diﬀerences due to cost, as observed in
their previous study. They concluded that ‘the optimal
model provides a reasonable good account of the
behavior of the subjects’ (p. 119).

1.3 Diﬀerent Sample Distributions for Each
Obseration
Most research concerned with sequential decision
making assumes that the observations are sampled
from the same distribution, i.e., Xi are distributed
identically for all i. For many decision situations,
however, the observations may be sampled from the
same distribution family with diﬀerent parameters, or
from diﬀerent distributions. Especially in economic
areas, such as price search, it is reasonable to assume
that the distributions from which observations are
taken change over time. The sequence of those samples
has been called nonstationary series. Of particular
interest are two special nonstationary series: ascending
and descending series. For ascending series, the observations are drawn from distributions, usually from
normal distributions, with increasing mean as i increases; for descending series the mean of the distribution decreases as i increases, i indicating the
sample index. For both cases, experiments have
been conducted to investigate choice behavior in a
changing environment. Shapira and Venezia (1981)
compared choice behavior for ascending, descending
and constant (identically distributed Xi) series. In one
experiment (numbers from a deck of cards), the
distributions were known to the DM; no explicit
observation costs were imposed; sampling occurred
without recall; and the number of observations that
could be taken was limited to n l 7. The variance of
the distributions varied across experimental groups.
An optimal procedure was assumed to continue taking
observations whenever xj n−j, and to stop as soon
as xj  n−j, where j l 1, 2… n indicates the number of
13920

observations which remain available. k l 1,…, n indicates the speciﬁc distribution for the jth observation.

"Across all conditions, 58 percent of the participants
behaved in an optimal way. The proportion of optimal
stopping did not depend on the type of series but on
the size of the variance. Nonoptimal stopping (24
percent stopped too early; 18 percent too late) depended on the series and on the size of the variance. In
particular, participants stopped too early on ascending
and too late on descending series. A similar result was
observed by Brickman (1972). In this study, departing
from the optimal stopping rule was attributed to an
inadequacy of the stopping rule taken for the particular experimental conditions (assuming complete
knowledge of the distributions). In a secretary problem
design (see Sect. 1.1), Corbin et al. (1975) were less
concerned with optimal choice behavior than with the
processes by which the participants made their selections, and with factors that inﬂuenced those processes.
The emphasis of the investigation was on decision
making heuristics rather than on the adequacy of
optimal models. With the same optimal stopping rule
for all experimental conditions, they found that
stopping behavior depended on contextual variables
such as the ascending or descending trend of the
inspected numbers of the stack.

2. Search Problems—Multiple Information
Sources
In a sequential decision making task with multiple
information sources, the DM has the option to take
information sequentially from diﬀerent sources. Each
information source may provide valid information
with a particular probability and at diﬀerent cost. The
task is not only to decide to stop or to continue the
process but also, if continuing, which source of
information to consult.
Early experimental studies were done by Kanarick
et al. (1969), Rapoport (1969), Rapoport et al. (1972).
A typical task is to ﬁnd an object (e.g., a black ball)
which is hidden in one of several possible locations
(e.g., in one of several bins containing white balls). The
optimal search strategy depends on further task
speciﬁcations, such as whether the object can move
from one location to another, how many objects are to
be found, and whether the search process may stop
before the object has been found. Rapoport (1969)

<-----Page 4----->Sequential Decision Making
investigated the case when a single object that could
not move was to be found in one of r, r  2, possible
locations. The DM was not allowed to stop the process
before the target was found. All of the following were
known to the DM: the a priori probability pi, pi  0
that the object is in location i, i l 1, 2,…, r, with ri =
pi l 1; a miss probability αi, 0 αi 1, that even if"
the object is in location i it will not be found in a
particular search of that location (1kαi is referred to
the respective detection probability); and a cost, ci, for
a single observation at location i. The objective of the
DM is to ﬁnd a search strategy that minimizes the
expected cost. For i l 1,…, r and j l 1, 2,… let Πij
denote the probability that the object is found at
location i during the jth search and the search is
terminated. Then
" (1kα ),
Πij l piα j−
i
i

i l 1,…, r, j l 1, 2,…

(6)

If all values of Πij\ci for all values of i and j are
arranged in order of decreasing magnitude, the optimal strategy is to search according to this ordering
(for derivations, see DeGroot 1970). Ties may be
ordered arbitrarily among themselves. The optimal
strategy is determined by the detection probabilities
and observation costs, and optimal search behavior
implies a balance between maximizing the detection
probability and minimizing the observation cost.
Rapoport (1969) found that participants did not
behave optimally. They were more concerned with
maximizing the probability of detecting the target
than with minimizing observation cost. Increasing the
diﬀerence of observation cost ci among the i l
1, 2, 3, 4 locations showed that the deviation from the
optimal strategy even increased. Rapoport et al. (1972)
varied the search problems by allowing the DM to
terminate the search at any time; adding a terminal
reward, R, for ﬁnding the target; and a terminal
penalty, B, for not ﬁnding the target. Most participants
showed a bias toward maximizing detection probability vs. minimizing search cost per observation,
similar to the previous study.

3. Sequential Decision Making with Two or More
Possible Decisions
A random sample X , X , … is generated by an
"
# Θ. The DM can take
unknown state of nature,
observations one at a time. After observing Xn l xn
the DM makes inferences about Θ based on the values
of Xi, …, Xn and can decide whether to continue
sampling observations or to stop the process. In the
former case, observation Xn+ is taken; in the latter, the
DM makes a ﬁnal decision d "? D. The consequences to
the DM depend on the decision d and the value θ.

The statistical theory for this situation was developed by Wald during the 1940s. It has been used to
test hypotheses and estimate parameters. In psychological research, sequential decision making of this
kind is usually limited to two decisions D l od , d q,
#
and applied to binary choice tasks (see Diﬀusion" and
Random Walk Processes; Stochastic Dynamic Models
(Choice, Response, and Time); Bayesian Theory:
History of Applications).
The standard theory of sequential analysis by Wald
(1947) does not include considerations of observation
costs C(n), losses for terminal decisions L(θ, d ), and a
priori (subjective) probabilities π of the alternative
states of nature. Deferred decision theory generalizes
the original theory by including these variables explicitly. The objective of the DM is to ﬁnd a stopping
rule that minimizes expected loss (called risk) and
expected observation cost. The form of that optimal
stopping rule depends mainly on the assumptions
about the number of observations that can be taken
(bounded or unbounded), and on the assumption of
cost per observation (ﬁxed or not) (see DeGroot 1970).
Birdsall and Roberts (1965), Edwards (1965), and
Rapoport and Burkheimer (1971) introduced the idea
of deferred decision theory as normative models of
choice behavior to the psychological community.
Experiments investigating human behavior in deferred
decision tasks have been carried out by Pitz and
colleagues (e.g., Pitz et al. 1969), and by Busemeyer and
Rapoport (1988). Rapoport and Wallsten (1972)
summarize experimental ﬁndings.
For illustration, assume the decision problem in its
simplest form. Suppose two possible states of nature θ
or θ , and two possible decisions d and d . Cost c per"
#
" of observations
#
observation
is ﬁxed and the number
is
unbounded. The DM does not know which of the
states of nature, θ or θ is generating the observation,
"
#
but there are a priori
probabilities
π that it is θ and
"
(1kπ) that it is θ . Let wi denote the loss for a terminal
#
decision incurred by the DM in deciding that θi is not
the correct state of nature when it actually is (i l 1, 2).
No losses are assumed when the DM makes a correct
decision. Let πn denote the posterior probability that
θ is the correct state of nature generating the
"
observations
after n observations have been made.
The total posterior expected loss is rn l
minow πn, w (1kπn)qjnc. The DM’s objective is to
" the# expected loss. An optimal stopping rule
minimize
is speciﬁed in terms of decision boundaries, α and β. If
the posterior probability is greater than or equal to α,
then decision d is made; if the posterior probability is
smaller than or"equal to β, then d is selected; otherwise
#
sampling continues.

Statistics plays two fundamental roles in empirical
research. One is in determining the data collection
process: the experimental design. The other is in
analyzing the data once it has been collected. For the
purposes of this article, two types of experimental designs are distinguished: sequential and nonsequential. In a sequential design the data that
accrue in an experiment can aﬀect the future course of
the experiment. For example, an observation made on
one experimental unit treated in a particular way may
determine the treatment used for the next experimental
unit. The term ‘adaptive’ is commonly used as an
alternative to sequential. In a nonsequential design the
investigator can carry out the entire experiment
without knowing any of the interim results.
The distinction between sequential and nonsequential is murky. An investigator’s ability to carry
out an experiment exactly as planned is uncertain, as
information that becomes available from within and
outside the experiment may lead the investigator to
amend the design. In addition, a nonsequential experiment may give results that encourage the investigator to run a second experiment, one that might
even simply be a continuation of the ﬁrst. Considered
separately, both experiments are nonsequential, but
the larger experiment that consists of the two separate
experiments is sequential.
In a typical type of nonsequential design, 20 patients
suﬀering from depression are administered a drug
and their improvements are assessed. An example
sequential variation is the following. Patients’ improvements are recorded ‘in sequence’ during the experiment. The experiment stops should it happen that
at least nine of the ﬁrst 10 patients, or no more than
one of the ﬁrst 10 patients improve(s). On the other
hand, if between two and eight of the ﬁrst 10 patients
improve then sampling continues to a second set of 10
patients, making the total sample size equal to 20 in
that case. Another type of sequential variation is when
the dose of the drug is increased for the second 10
patients should it happen that fewer than four of the
ﬁrst 10 improve.
Much more complicated sequential designs are
possible. For example, the ﬁrst patient may be assigned
a dose in the middle of a range of possible doses. If the
patient improves then the next patient is assigned the
next lower dose, and if the ﬁrst patient does not
improve then the next patient is assigned the next
higher dose. This process continues, always dropping
the dosage if the immediately preceding patient
improved, and increasing the dosage if the immediately
preceding patient did not improve. This is called an
‘up-and-down’ design.
Procedures in which batches of experimental units
(such as groups of 10 patients each) are analyzed
before proceeding to the next stage of the experiment
