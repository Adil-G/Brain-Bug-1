Towards a Model of the Business
Angel Investment Process

(Accepted 14 December 2006)

ABSTRACT This paper examines the process that business angels undertake when they invest in
new and small businesses. Existing research has generally taken a disaggregated approach and
focused on individual stages of the investment process. Based on the empirical evidence gathered
from 30 interviews with business angels this paper presents an overarching model of the angel
investment process. Underlying factors that generate and sustain the investment process are also
identiﬁed. A comparison is made between the investment processes in the informal and formal
venture capital markets, ﬁnding that the emphasis on softer factors diﬀerentiates the former from
the latter. The paper not only contributes to the existing literature but also provides policy
makers, entrepreneurs and prospective angels with a greater understanding of the factors which
underpin and sustain the angel investment process.
KEY WORDS: Business angels, investment process, informal market, venture capital

Introduction
While there has been a growth in interest in business angels by both academics and
policy makers in recent years, there are still areas of their activities that remain underresearched. One of the most signiﬁcant of these is the angel investment process. The
objective of this exploratory study is to add to the relatively limited literature by
setting out an empirically based model of the angel investing process. In particular,
it addresses the calls by Haines et al. (2003) and Feeney et al. (1999) to better
understand the investment decisions of business angels and to examine the factors
impacting upon diﬀerent stages of the investment process. Haines et al. (2003) also
suggested further consideration of the link between formal and informal investors and
this is addressed by highlighting similarities and diﬀerences between the ﬁndings of
the current research and what we know about the formal venture capital market.
A soundly based and readily understood model oﬀers a number of advantages to
stakeholders in the investment process. It can help entrepreneurs and angels better
appreciate the concerns that each party to a deal may have as well as providing

insight into the complexities associated with reaching an agreement. It may also be
useful to prospective business angels by highlighting the key activities that need to be
managed eﬀectively for successful outcomes. Furthermore, a clearer understanding
will enable policy makers and support agencies direct initiatives at diﬀerent stages of
the investment process rather than adopting ‘blanket’ solutions to market imperfections (Westhead and Wright, 1998).
The paper is organized in the following way. The existing literature on the business
angel investment process is reviewed and the methodology applied in this study is set
out. The results of the research are then presented from which an empirically based
model of the angel investment process is derived. This is followed by a consideration
of the key factors underpinning the business angel investment process and a
discussion about the similarities and diﬀerences between the investment processes in
the informal and formal venture capital markets. Finally, the paper concludes by
identifying areas for further research.
The Business Angel Investment Process
The literature on the business angel investment process is limited in scope and detail.
Attempts that examine the overall process include Amatucci and Sohl (2004), Haines
et al. (2003) and Van Osnabrugge and Robinson (2000). Amatucci and Sohl (2004)
divided the process into three broad stages, namely pre-investment, contract
negotiation and post-investment, to facilitate their study of women entrepreneurs.
Haines et al. (2003) oﬀered a more elaborate eight-stage model for their focus group
interviews with Canada-based angels, but cautioned against concluding that it
represented the process that informal investors use. Van Osnabrugge and Robinson
(2000) also applied a generalized eight-stage framework to both venture capitalists
and business angels but, again, this lacked an empirical basis.
The majority of studies of the informal investment process have generally taken
a disaggregated approach and focused on particular stages from a supply-side
perspective. For example, in screening investments Fiet (1995a, b) has highlighted
the importance of agency risk to business angels while Madill et al. (2005) have
found that angels are likely to consider how they can contribute to the business over
and above their ﬁnancial contribution. Feeney et al. (1999) and Mason and Harrison
(1996) focused on the decision stage of the investment process by examining the
evaluation criteria of business angels, ﬁnding that considerable weight is given to the
assessment of the entrepreneur’s abilities and track record. In reaching a decision a
key issue for an angel is the balancing of risk and reward. How likely is it that the
actual outcomes of the investment will be diﬀerent from that predicted, and how
does this risk compare with the potential returns from the business? A constructive
view of decision making (Payne et al., 1992) suggests that an angel will be faced with
a choice characterized by conﬂict, uncertainty and complexity. Conﬂict may arise
over the ﬁner points of the agreement. Uncertainty may surface, for example, where
nagging doubts persist about the ability of the entrepreneur behind the business.
Complexity may be increased where an angel has been considering more than one
investment opportunity or participates in an investment syndicate whose members
have diﬀering views as to the commercial viability of the entrepreneur’s plans. The
angel’s assessment of the personal qualities and characteristics of the entrepreneur

(Harrison and Mason, 2002), appraisal of the marketing strategy and ﬁnancial
projections (Mason and Harrison, 1996) and the angel’s needs and expectations of
what he/she requires from an investment require to be reconciled as a ﬁnal decision is
reached, what Harrison (1999) calls ‘fusion’ in a decision process.
Post-investment, evidence suggests that angels monitor their investments with the
majority taking a hands-on role in the business using their commercial skills and
experience to add value over and above their ﬁnancial investment (Harrison and
Mason, 1992; Freear et al., 1995; Madill et al., 2005). An angel with suﬃcient funds
need not wait until one investment is harvested before scanning for, and possibly
investing in, other opportunities. Experience of the process, successful or otherwise,
is also likely to inﬂuence the types of opportunities subsequently sought by an angel.
Evidence about the exit strategies of angels is limited but suggests that a majority
had no preference whether it is achieved by a management buy-out, trade sale or
initial public oﬀering (Paul et al., 2003). Given the high-risk nature of informal
investing there is also the possibility that the business will fail or only be a moderate
success in which case it may be diﬃcult for the angel to exit, what Ruhnka et al.
(1992) call a ‘living dead’ investment.
While studies of the informal market have generally taken a disaggregated
approach, attempts to provide an overarching research-based model of the venture
capital investment process are to be found in the formal market where robust
frameworks have been provided by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) and Fried and Hisrich
(1994). Both examine the process from a supply-side perspective and, while
each adopts a diﬀerent methodological approach, both reach broadly similar
conclusions. Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) used a structured questionnaire administered
by a combination of a mailing and a telephone survey to validate a model of
venture capitalists’ investment activities. However, while it was found that the
activities could be described as an orderly process involving ﬁve sequential steps,
their research concentrated on the evaluation criteria of venture capitalists with less
attention paid to other steps in the process. Fried and Hisrich (1994) adopted a case
study methodology which resulted in a six-stage model of the venture capital
investment process based upon a sample of 18 venture capitalists. The focus of this
research was pre-investment activities and excluded what happened after venture
capital ﬁnance had been obtained. Given the complementary nature of their work
(Freear and Wetzel, 1990; Benjamin and Margulis, 1996; Sørheim, 2005), venture
capitalists and business angels make natural comparison groups (Wiltbank, 2005).
The models put forward by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) and Fried and Hisrich (1994),
therefore, provide useful reference points against which the process in the informal
market can be compared and both models are set out side-by-side in Figure 1.

Methodology
Approach
While qualitative research is not widely used in the study of entrepreneurship
(Gartner and Birley, 2002) such an approach was adopted for data collection and
analysis because of the exploratory nature of the study (Lee, 1999; Yin, 2003).
To understand how a process works it is necessary to adopt methods that allow those

involved to talk about their perceptions and the processes that have emerged
(Smircich and Stubbart, 1985; Gartner et al., 1992). Accordingly, interviews with
business angels were conducted in order to reveal the subtleties of the informal
investment process and to highlight its key characteristics. This approach facilitates a
subsequent analysis in which a researcher can look for patterns in the data (Taylor
and Bogdan, 1984; Fischer et al., 1997) as well as providing rich contextual evidence
and meanings to processes that have not been previously explored in depth
(Howorth et al., 2004).
Concerns about the biases inherent in retrospective accounts were addressed by
asking each interviewee to focus on their most recent investment. This yielded four
key methodological advantages (Fried and Hisrich, 1994). First, studying an actual
investment eliminates problems associated with hypothetical or non-contingent
responses. Second, examining the most recent investment helps to ensure that the
recollection is more accurate. Third, it enables sequential decision making to be
examined and, ﬁnally, because the success or otherwise of the investment is unknown
at the time of the interview, this approach minimizes any tendency to self-reporting
bias. This approach also met Hindle’s (2004) recommendation to interview

individuals who are still active in an event rather than asking them to retell a ‘war
story’ many years later.
Data Collection
Earlier work enabled the research team to ask members of both Scotland’s established
business angel network (BAN) and its oldest angel investment syndicate, Archangel,
if they would be available for interview. We also gained cooperation from another of
Scotland’s investment syndicates, Equity Partners, and we wrote to their members
asking to conduct interviews. Moreover, we were able to include angels who had
never been BAN or syndicate members but to whom we had been referred by ‘word of
mouth’. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the resulting sample of 30
Scotland-based business angels, two of whom were female and all of whom had made
at least one investment. With the permission of each angel, these interviews were
recorded and an assurance given that the identity of the individual and the ﬁrm would
not be disclosed. Interviews were then transcribed to enable subsequent analysis.
The interviews were conducted at a place of the angel’s choosing, often an oﬃce at
either the angel’s home or business premises and lasted from 45 minutes to two
hours. After inviting interviewees to provide a brief overview of their careers to date,
an open-ended questioning technique was utilized as each angel was asked to ‘talk
through’ the process followed in his or her most recent investment, highlighting key
events and issues. As an interviewee made observations, questions were asked to
elicit rich detail and descriptions or to learn why observations were important
(Isabella, 1990). For example, ‘Could you give an example of what you were looking
for when he [the entrepreneur] made his presentation?’, ‘Who did you speak to about
the [entrepreneur’s] proposal?’, and ‘What was important to you about that . . .?’.
The study is, therefore, based on informants’ perceptions, not on observations of
their actual behaviour, an approach based on Schein’s (1985) view that what is
important is what participants themselves perceive to be important. The key concern
in each interview was to maintain a focus on the interviewee’s most recent investment
and to establish how the investment process unfolded. The key question to which we
kept returning in the interviews was ‘And then what happened?’. The interviewees
described 30 separate investments, 20 of which were co-investments with at least one
other business angel. The 30 angels had made a total of 130 investments.
Data about business angels should always be examined with caution. The diﬃculty
of achieving a representative sample of business angels is well established in the
literature (for example, Wetzel, 1983; Harrison and Mason, 1992). However,
concerns about validity are balanced by the opportunity to gain insight into an
under-researched area of investment activity. We addressed the issue of representativeness by drawing our sample from the four sources indicated earlier, and, while
the interviewees are a convenience sample, we have no doubt that it reﬂects the
heterogeneity of angel investors found in many marketplaces.
Data Analysis
Process data are diﬃcult to analyse: boundaries are ambiguous, timing of events vary
in terms of precision, duration and relevance and, despite a focus on events, process

data can be eclectic drawing in relationships, thoughts and feelings (Langley, 1999).
With this in mind, the six-step framework set out by Van de Ven and Poole (2002) to
analyse process data was adapted to guide the data analysis. This provided a systematic schema for analysing the process data and is shown in column A of Table 1.
Column B sets out what the researchers did at each stage of the analysis and column
C provides examples of what resulted from that action. The ﬁrst step in the
framework was to establish process categories that provided the interviewer with an
analytical focus, namely pre-investment, negotiation and post-investment stages.
Interviewees did not always recall events in the investment process in a linear time
sequence and, therefore, the temporal ordering of events was necessary. The third
analytical step was to identify ‘naturally recurring’ (Lee, 1999) references by
interviewees to how the investment process developed. The aim was to identify the
key events and activities that were carried out in order to enable the investment
process to advance and then allocate these to process categories. Reliability and
validity were enhanced by ensuring a consensus among the researchers on allocating
activities to process categories. The next step was to identify the order and sequence
of events from the data with the broad process categories tested and developed by
constant comparison (Dougherty, 2002). For example, as the interview data were
examined the importance of an angel’s ﬁrst meeting with the entrepreneur was
underlined and this, subsequently, became identiﬁed as a discreet activity in the
model that was eventually developed. Similarly, the data also demonstrated that
screening should be identiﬁed as a separate stage and could usefully be divided into
two phases, ‘initial’ and ‘detailed’. The analysis resulted in a model setting out ﬁve
main stages in the investment process as well as enabling the identiﬁcation of the
main factors underpinning the process. The practice of illustrating the results by
using verbatim quotes from informants is adopted (Ryan and Bernard, 2003) and the
convention of using gerunds (Strauss and Corbin, 1990) is followed within the angel
investment model where appropriate.
The data were examined to establish whether there were any diﬀerences in the
investment processes between respondents who were members of a BAN compared
to those who were not. We did not ﬁnd this to be so except in those cases where the
angel learned of the opportunity through BAN membership. This referral source was
given weight by investors particularly where the BAN had conducted some
preliminary sifting to identify those members who might be interested in the type
of opportunity presented by the entrepreneur.

The Business Angel Investment Process

113

Modelling complicated processes is problematic. Conceptualizing and describing
sequential patterns forces a classic trade-oﬀ among simplicity, accuracy and
generality (Weick, 1979) and the outcome can be a framework unable to capture
the richness of a given situation or set of circumstances. The business angel
investment process is not exempt from this danger with studies in a number of
countries highlighting the heterogeneity of informal investors, for example, in the
United States (Freear et al., 1995), the United Kingdom (Mason and Harrison, 1994,
2000), Sweden (Landström, 1993), Finland (Lumme et al., 1996), Australia (Hindle
and Wenban, 1999), Norway (Reitan and Sørheim, 2000), Singapore (Hindle and
Lee, 2002) and Scotland (Paul et al., 2003). However, while warning of the danger of
‘caricature’, Bygrave (1989) argues that reservations about modelling are counterbalanced by the advantages oﬀered by a soundly constructed model in understanding
real-life situations. We were able to identify key factors in the process while
maintaining a generality of application to provide a readily comprehended model
that will not only contribute to the literature in this area but also assist stakeholders
in the informal investment marketplace gain a greater understanding of the process.
We do not claim that it ﬁts every circumstance described to us as even relatively
simple processes can generate a variety of sequences of events (Pentland, 1995).
Notwithstanding, we have conﬁdence that the model is robust and enables
conclusions to be drawn about how the business angel investment process unfolds.
Findings
While we found the angel investment process to be sequential, to describe it as
orderly would be overly simplistic. Many deals do not progress smoothly and the
process can easily stall as a result of any number of factors. For example, raising the
full capital sum required for a business may involve funding from several angels and
while some may be willing to invest, others may be more reluctant. Equally, an angel
may get ‘cold feet’ and delay the process in order to carry out more screening.
Relationships also have their ‘ups and downs’ as prospective partners get to know
each other’s preferences and idiosyncrasies. Also, external factors have an impact on
the process. For example, an angel told us that illness had delayed the investment
process by six months. Timescales vary and, in our sample, the time from ﬁrst
contact between an angel and entrepreneur and investment being made ranged from
three to 18 months. Moreover, an angel can easily withdraw from the process by
terminating discussions with the entrepreneur at any time prior to making an
investment. Notwithstanding, analysis of the interviews with business angels suggests
that the angel investment process can be represented in ﬁve stages: familiarization,
screening, bargaining, managing and harvesting (Figure 2).
Iteration is a deﬁning characteristic of the process. The main iterative loop
spans the ﬁrst three stages of the angel investment process, namely familiarization,
screening and bargaining. Together, these three stages involve an iterative assessment encompassing six main activities in which an angel continuously adds to the
information at his/her disposal. Deliberation and analysis, often involving third
parties in the form of friends and advisers, are undertaken as more detailed
knowledge and greater understanding are gained about the opportunity. The model
(Figure 2) highlights this intensely iterative phase of the investment process in which

<-----Page 8----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:24 20 April 2008

114

S. Paul et al.

Figure 2. A model of the angel investment process

the ability to validate both hard and soft data is key to progressing from one stage to
the next. Although each interview focused on an investment that had been made, the
model recognizes that an angel had the opportunity of terminating the process at any
time during this iterative phase.
The model also demonstrates the possibility of a backward step as an agreement is
being formulated. Angels often have little information to guide them in valuing an
equity stake in a business. Any new information or unexpected event can cause an
angel to reassess his/her position. In one case an entrepreneur unexpectedly
suggested bringing in a family member as a co-investor which resulted in the angel
re-scrutinizing the entire business proposition. Two further stages complete the
process, namely managing and harvesting the investment.
The impact of formal and informal networks is explicitly recognized in the model.
The former includes communities of practice that actively support angel activity
such as BANs, syndicates and economic development agencies while the latter is
comprised of the informal personal networks to which an angel may turn for advice
and support such as friends, co-investors and business associates. The model also
acknowledges the importance of an angel’s personal investment objectives on the
process. These may be ﬁnancial such as income and capital growth but can include
personal goals such as ﬁnding a part-time interest with, for example, an angel
assessing how much time she/he wishes to devote to a business once an investment
had been made. The model also demonstrates how the investment process can be
aﬀected by an angel’s investment objectives, particularly if these change. For
example, a change in ﬁnancial circumstances may cause an angel to re-prioritize
the balance between achieving income or capital growth and, in turn, may aﬀect
the assessment of a potential investment. Many factors enable and constrain
investment processes and the model, therefore, is completed by showing the impact

that the general environment may have at any stage. This includes economic,
socio-cultural, political and technological inﬂuences, any or all of which may aﬀect
business angel activities. Each of the ﬁve stages shown in the model is discussed,
in turn, below with environmental and network inﬂuences highlighted as
appropriate.
Familiarization Stage
This stage of the investment process comprises two main activities, learning about
the opportunity and meeting the entrepreneur. The interviewees found investment
opportunities through three main sources: business associates, BANs and investment
syndicates. More formal methods of ﬁnding investments through, for example,
accountants, lawyers, banks and other ﬁnancial institutions were comparatively
unimportant. At this early stage in the process most angels preferred to read a twoto three-page summary business plan though some wished to see a more detailed
version. Assessment of the opportunity begins immediately with location and
industry sector key considerations. Angels preferred to invest close to home. One
interviewee said: ‘The further away the investment is, the more other factors have to
be really good to compensate’.
However, angels may be prepared to examine proposals that do not meet their
preferences, particularly if a trusted business associate has referred the proposal to
them. Another interviewee who eventually invested outside his preferred industry
sector said that initially he had only agreed to read the business plan because, ‘An
old friend phoned me and, since I knew him so well, I said yes [to reading the
business plan]’.
The result of this activity was to contact the entrepreneur, usually by phone, in
order to have a preliminary discussion and arrange a ﬁrst meeting. Business angels
are wealthy individuals and are generally under little pressure to make an investment
in order to generate income or capital growth. They can aﬀord to wait until not only
the right opportunity but also the right person comes along. While more information
may be gathered about the business opportunity, assessment at this stage focuses on
the entrepreneur or team behind the business. One angel described the importance of
ﬁnding an entrepreneur with whom he could work as follows: ‘I liked the guy
[entrepreneur] . . . I thought I could get along with this guy’.
It was clear that if entrepreneurs wanted to engage a serious interest from an
angel, they needed to be able to present not only their ideas but also themselves
eﬀectively. As one angel said to us: ‘It’s a people thing. You ﬁnd out very early if
people are going to be reasonable. If they are dogmatic . . . I think the chance of
having a long-term relationship with them is pretty thin’. Another angel made the
same point in this way: ‘Two guys in the team (running the business) were what
attracted me to the business’. One angel who invests with a small syndicate said that
while the idea may be ‘brilliant’, the person who runs the business is key – ‘can we
work together?’ – is the most important question. Another interviewee who had not
been overly impressed upon reading a summary business plan said that when he met
the entrepreneur: ‘I realized he [the entrepreneur] knew exactly what he was doing.
There was no waﬄe . . . if you asked a question, he answered it. In an instant I
decided he was interesting . . . call it intuition’.

S. Paul et al.

Screening Stage
From this stage onwards in pre-investment activities, angels engage in more
structured assessment to which we apply the term ‘screening’. This involves the
angel in sifting both the hard and soft data about the opportunity and the
entrepreneur(s) behind it. It begins with an initial screening stage during which
further meetings with the entrepreneur take place as business angels try to conﬁrm
ﬁrst impressions and to dig deeper into the business opportunity. The interviewees
used their own business networks to check out the background and track record of
the entrepreneur. One said: ‘I’ll do whatever it takes to check out anyone who asks
me for money’. Another said: ‘After we got the business plan we did background
checks. I phoned around people who I thought might know these people [the
entrepreneurs]’.
During this stage a thorough study of the business plan will also be made. One
angel talked about ‘looking at the market, talking to others (about the market),
doing my homework’. Where a proposal involved angels investing in an industry or a
technology with which they are unfamiliar, advice was often sought from business
associates sometimes with a view to bringing them into the deal as additional angels.
At this stage, business angels are also likely to be assessing how they can contribute
to the business beyond the scope of their ﬁnancial investment. As one angel said:
‘Once you have indicated that you are interested and that you might invest, you have
got to spend time with them and look for opportunities where you could make a
contribution’. Foreseeing a satisfactory post-investment role can be a key factor in
ensuring that the investment process unfolds smoothly as consideration of this issue
makes it more likely that angels will achieve good ‘matches’ with appropriate
entrepreneurs.
Fried and Hisrich (1994) describe how a venture capitalist can form an ‘emotional’
commitment to an investment proposal. We found that interviewees made a similar
commitment. In the course of screening an opportunity there came a point at
which an angel concluded that she/he would like to invest in the opportunity, albeit a
number of outstanding concerns remained to be resolved. Consequently, the
amount of time spent on a proposal increased dramatically. With the angel
becoming heavily involved, scrutiny of the business plan was likely to result in it
being amended, particularly if the venture is at the start-up stage. A typical
comment was: ‘You go through the business plan and say change that, change the
other. And if it [the relationship] is going to work, they [the entrepreneurs] will look
at it seriously’.
We found the most common areas for revision to be marketing and ﬁnance. On
this speciﬁc point, one angel said: ‘When I look at the development costs [in the
business plan] . . . expect a 50 per cent overspend or something like that to get to the
ﬁrst development milestone’.
At this point in the process, the number of additional angels, if any, who are to
be involved is resolved. This was particularly important to angels with limited
investment experience. One said: ‘with a syndicate it was easier’. Another said: ‘It
[the relationship] was not formal in any way, but another investor was a cashedout entrepreneur himself and had been an experienced angel . . . and, yes, this
helped’.

The Business Angel Investment Process

117

Bargaining Stage
In this stage due diligence is completed. It was often not a formalized activity and
frequently carried out, at least in part, by angels themselves. Negotiations were also
ﬁnalized on the value of ﬁnancial investment in equity terms. How much an angel
should expect to receive for varying levels of investment was a key issue. These were
often diﬃcult negotiations – one angel described it as ‘a robust discussion’ – as the
angel and entrepreneur tried to ‘feel their way’ to an agreement. In part, this can be
due to business angels investing early in the entrepreneurial process when there is
often little to value. As one angel said about the business in which he had invested:
‘It’s just what you feel is right . . . there was no track record’.
However, where the entrepreneur has already established a business and made an
outlay of time and money, this provided the angel with something to which an
approximate value could more readily be attached. Notwithstanding, we found that
angels often approach the issue of equity valuation intuitively with many
interviewees unable to provide a rationale. Comments about how they undertook
the calculation included:
‘I found that to be one of the hardest things (in the process)’.
‘There are no real guidelines – you’ve just got to use your judgement’.
‘It was almost impossible’.
‘I got a feel for what was right as the process went along’.
‘It’s a process of negotiation . . . there is no point if they [the entrepreneurs] feel
short-changed’.
Consideration is also given as to how and when additional investment funds will
be made available though, in the majority of cases, this was not set out in a formal
agreement.
Given the risk and reward issues described in the bargaining phase, reaching a
ﬁnal agreement was often more diﬃcult than the parties had believed it would be. In
one case conﬂict arose over the ﬁner points of the agreement where one party wanted
to transfer shareholding to a family member. In another case signing the agreement
was delayed where one member of an investment syndicate suddenly decided not to
invest which resulted in a reallocation of shareholdings. One experienced angel
summed it up this way: ‘. . . you can’t relax until the ink (on the agreement
document) is dry’. The conclusion of the bargaining stage is a formal agreement
between the entrepreneurs and angels setting out the detail of the agreement reached.
Managing Stage
The interviewees were ‘hands on’ investors taking an active post-investment role in
the businesses in which they invest. ‘I believe I have a contribution to make’ was a
common theme. Another said, ‘If I can do something to help the business, I will’.
Before becoming an angel, an investor who had worked for a large company said
that his skill lay in ‘getting the best out of a team’. Referring to his last angel
investment, he said ‘what I had to oﬀer was getting the best out of them (the partners
behind the business) – helping them get organized’.

Typically, the interviewees restricted the number of businesses in which they
invested. While the overall level of funds available for investment is a limiting factor,
time is also a critical resource. Angels were concerned not to over-stretch themselves
by committing to too many companies. As one angel commented: ‘I want to be able
to spend about a day a week on each investment so that limits the overall number [of
investments] I can make’. Another said: ‘I spent about two days a week on getting
the company launched with the suppliers – it was a concentrated burst of activity’.
Harvesting Stage
None of the businesses in this research had reached the stage where the angel had
realized the investment. However, when asked about their intentions, angels had no
clear preference about how this should be achieved other than estimating that it
would most likely be by a trade sale rather than an initial public oﬀering or
management buy-back. The following comment was representative: ‘I don’t have a
strategy as such’. Asked about whether he had an exit strategy another said: ‘No.
Our only strategy is to build the business and develop the value of the business and
we’ll do that through ongoing sales . . . a large national may want to buy us . . . we’ll
not go out and court that’. Exit timescales were elastic, albeit angels wished to keep
their investment for at least as long as necessary to maximize tax advantages. One
angel commented: ‘Business angels have a diﬀerent time frame – we take longer to
exit [than venture capitalists]’.
Discussion
Reducing the complex to the simple can mask the subtleties of everyday practice and
setting out a process does not, of itself, explain the underlying factors that underpin
it (Pentland, 1995). Explanation requires some insight into what Abbott (1992)
called the ‘generating mechanisms’ of a process. These are set out below before the
discussion turns to a comparison of the investment processes in the informal and
formal markets.
Generating Mechanisms
Although we have proposed a ﬁve-stage angel investment process it would be wrong
to see the process as ﬁtting into neat compartments. In practice, stages overlap and
boundaries are blurred. Notwithstanding, two generating mechanisms can be
identiﬁed which drive forward the angel investment process, namely, the personal
nature of the process and the activity of assessment.
Personal Nature of the Process
We found informal investing to be a process characterized by intense interaction
through a series of interlocking stages in which impetus is gathered as collaborative
practices are developed. This can be seen throughout the process. For example, in
‘learning about the opportunity’ the current research conﬁrms earlier work
which highlighted the referral source as an important factor to business angels

The Business Angel Investment Process

119

(Riding et al., 1993; Mason and Rogers, 1997): ex post of a decision to invest, the
evidence gathered in this and other studies (Harrison and Mason, 1992; Freear et al.,
1995; Paul et al., 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004) suggests that angels become
personally involved in the businesses in which they invest, an involvement facilitated
by a good working relationship with the entrepreneur. Throughout, personal
relationships underpin the informal investment process with angels placing emphasis
on choosing to conduct business with people they believe ‘will behave reliably’
(Shane and Stuart, 2002).
Assessment
The second generating mechanism, which also spans the entire investment process, is
assessment. From the moment an angel learns of a possible investment opportunity,
assessment begins with the weighing-up of both hard and soft data. Initially, the
angel is assessing whether the opportunity meets his/her investment criteria in terms
of location and industry sector. How far away is the venture? What do I know about
this industry? The angel’s focus then switches to the entrepreneur, her/his
personality, background and experience. Can I work with this person? Does the
entrepreneur have a good track record in this area? As the process unfolds,
marketing and ﬁnance considerations receive emphasis: are the sales projections
justiﬁed? Have we got our sums correct? Who else might invest in the business? The
decision to invest represents a synthesis of the angel’s assessment of the hard and soft
data that has been culled from earlier in the process. Post-investment angels become
involved in the venture enabling them not simply to monitor but to assess and
actively manage their investment. How is the business doing? Are sales high enough?
What else can I do? And, although none of the ventures in this study had reached the
‘harvesting’ stage, it can be postulated that this would involve the angel in assessing
whether and when to exit.
Investment Processes in the Informal and Formal Investment Markets
A comparison of the venture capital models (Figure 1) and the angel model
(Figure 2) demonstrates both similarities and diﬀerences. All are essentially linear
representations of processes in which the main participants engage in pre- and postinvestment activities linked by a successful bargaining phase in which a formal
agreement is concluded. However, compared to evidence about investors in the
formal market we found business angels give more weight to softer factors; such
diﬀerences can be identiﬁed at diﬀerent stages of the angel investment model either in
relation to the venture capital models or by reference to the wider literature about
the formal market.
A major diﬀerence is the way in which the angel model emphasizes the importance
of the early activities of the investment process. In the familiarization stage the
impact made by the entrepreneur at the ﬁrst meeting with the angel is a key factor in
determining whether the process goes any further. A useful parallel can be drawn
with job selection interviews where research emphasizes the signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst
impression that the candidate makes on the interviewer (Dion et al., 1972; Arvey and
Campion, 1982). This corresponds with the ﬁnding by Mason and Harrison (2003)

<-----Page 14----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:24 20 April 2008

S. Paul et al.

who, in a study on technology-based ventures, concluded that impression management skills of entrepreneurs are critical in raising ﬁnance from external investors.
The importance of the initial meeting between the angel and entrepreneur is recognized by distinguishing it as a separate activity in the angel investment model
(Figure 2). By comparison the models of the formal venture capital market
(Figure 1) integrate the initial meeting in a more general origination stage and focus
more on the later pre-investment activities.
In the screening of investments the balance of evidence suggests that business
angels are more likely than venture capitalists to give greater emphasis to personal
factors. While early research on the screening and evaluation activities of venture
capitalists highlighted human capital to be the most important decision criterion (see
Manigart and Sapienza, 2000), there is also evidence pointing to market factors such
as growth potential being of equal or greater importance (Hall and Hofer, 1993;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 1995). Evidence giving equal weight to market factors has
not been found in the informal market. Findings from this study and others (for
example, Mason and Rogers, 1997; Feeney et al., 1999; Paul et al., 2003; Mason and
Stark, 2004) conﬁrm that, in the informal market, conﬁdence in the entrepreneur
behind the project is critical.
During the bargaining stage of the investment process, compared to venture
capitalists, informal investors work with less information, have little precedent to
draw on and do not have the resources to carry out in-depth market analysis (Fiet,
1995b). Faced with these hurdles, we found angels to be intuitive in assessing how
much equity they should receive in return for their investment. Deﬁned as a ‘felt
awareness for a situation as a whole’ (Bastick, 1982), intuition involves the
integration of disparate information (Hisrich and Jankowicz, 1990) as an angel
performs a balancing act in which the value of the opportunity is weighed in equity
terms. Evidence from the formal venture capital market suggests that projects are
typically assessed by applying one or more valuation techniques to the ﬁnancial and
accounting information contained in the business plan submitted by the
entrepreneur (Wright and Robbie, 1996). This assessment process is likely to involve
several iterations to test the robustness of the internal rate of return (IRR), the most
common measure of performance used by the venture capital industry (Murray,
1999). In the interviews conducted with the business angels, IRR was not raised in
relation to valuation or any other aspect of the angel investment process. Moreover,
while ﬁnance theory suggests that, faced with a lack of information about an
opportunity, investors respond by writing contracts which are designed to shift risk
to the entrepreneur (Denis, 2004), we found little evidence of such traditional riskshifting strategies at either the bargaining or other stages of the angel investment
process.
The extent of post-investment involvement in the management of the entrepreneur’s business is likely to vary between venture capitalists and business angels. In
the formal market, the key roles undertaken by venture capitalists are as strategic
sounding boards and ﬁnancial advisers (Manigart and Sapienza, 2000). In contrast,
we found that, in the managing stage of the process, angels typically expect to take a
role that enables them to contribute not only strategically but also operationally by
interacting with the entrepreneur on an ongoing basis, an outcome shared with
Madill et al. (2005).

The Business Angel Investment Process

121

Given the complementary nature of the work of venture capitalists and business
angels these ﬁndings pose the question whether the diﬀerences in the investment
processes of the informal and formal venture capital markets are surprising. Both
markets serve the same purpose of providing ﬁnance to high-risk businesses in return
for equity stakes which, it is hoped, will be realized at a future date for a signiﬁcant
return. However, we suggest that the greater emphasis given to softer factors in the
informal investment market can, in large measure, be attributed to a combination of
two factors. First, in the early stages of a venture’s development, assets are often
intangible and knowledge based (Hsu, 2004) and evidence from trading performance
is limited. Therefore, in direct contrast to venture capitalists who operate in what
Shepherd et al. (2003) characterize as an ‘information-rich’ environment, business
angels work with little historic performance data on which judgements about
investments can be based (Freear et al., 1995). Against such a background, angels
have little option but to place relatively greater weight on the attributes of the
founders of businesses.
Second, venture capitalists are employed by others and raise funds by signalling
their competence to unearth opportunities and, thereafter, maximize investment
returns. Conversely, angels use their own funds and are fully exposed to both the risk
and reward of any investment. They do not have ﬁxed targets in terms of return and
timescales, and are beholden only to themselves. This disparity results in what
Haines et al. (2003) term a ‘fundamental agency theoretic diﬀerence’. Whereas
venture capitalists concentrate on competent screening, due diligence and contract
formulation during the investment process as a risk reduction strategy, angels are
more likely to focus on an active post-involvement role in the business (Van
Osnabrugge, 2000). This relationship-based approach to risk reduction results in
angels placing a greater emphasis on softer factors throughout the investment
process compared to venture capitalists.
This study has implications for policy makers and support agencies who wish to
encourage new ventures and for entrepreneurs seeking to raise equity ﬁnance.
Considerable resources have been given to the provision of supply-side measures
aimed at plugging the small-ﬁrm equity gap (see Cressy, 2002 for a discussion). Our
ﬁndings about the importance angels give to softer factors suggest that emphasis
could also usefully be given to demand-side measures to help entrepreneurs more
eﬀectively market themselves and their business propositions. In particular, two
measures are suggested. First, presentation skills training for entrepreneurs in the
overall context of investment readiness (Mason and Harrison, 2001) could be
beneﬁcial. Second, support agencies and other intermediaries should encourage
entrepreneurs to assess the post-investment role they wish an angel to play. A
successful relationship between an angel and an entrepreneur underpins the informal
investment process and is, in turn, facilitated by a good match between the skills and
experience that an investor can oﬀer and the needs of the business.
Future Research
This paper does not treat the entire range of issues and roles associated with
the business angel investment process. The scope of the research was limited to the
supply side, which facilitated a direct comparison with the process studies of the

<-----Page 16----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:24 20 April 2008

formal venture capital market. However, there is much to be gained from examining
a process from several diﬀerent perspectives (Pettigrew, 1990) and it would be useful
to examine the demand side of the informal market in order to chart the perceptions
and experiences of entrepreneurs. For example, what has been the experience of
entrepreneurs who have successfully secured investment from business angels, and
what can be learned? This could be contrasted with the experience of entrepreneurs
who have not been successful in securing such investment. The development of case
studies of both successful and failed angel – entrepreneur relationships would be
particularly useful to those active in the informal investment market.
While the investments were made in both high and low technology ﬁrms, it was
not possible to draw comparisons based on the diﬀerent environments in which the
ﬁrms operate. Therefore, further research to enable greater delineation of how
environmental factors aﬀect the process would also be valuable. The criteria used to
make a ﬁnal decision on whether to proceed with an investment, the bargaining stage
of the process, require further investigation. In the formal investment market, recent
work has suggested that venture capitalists are poor at introspecting about how they
arrive at decisions (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998; Shepherd, 1999; Shepherd et al.,
2003). This raises the question of whether business angels are any better. More realtime studies would be a valuable way of examining this issue. Such research would
also be helpful in establishing the heuristics at work in business angel decision
making, for example, about how much equity should be expected for varying levels
of investment. With little historic information on which to base a decision,
establishing reliable rules of thumb adopted by successful business angels would be
valuable.
