Abstract
In making cross-country social comparisons, `trust' has usually been treated as a culturally
determined primitive. However, understanding the determinants of trust would enhance our
understanding of its effects on the nature of contracting and on organizational structure. Theories of
economists and sociologists generally predict a positive relationship between trust and information
flows. We examine some institutional determinants of trust, using data from the World Values
Survey 1990±1993 and the International Telecommunications Union Yearbook. Our finding that
trust is increasing in the ease of two-way communication, particularly in urbanized economies, calls
into question the extreme viewpoint that trust is purely a historical residue. # 1999 Elsevier

1. Introduction
The definition of trust has been much debated by social scientists over the past decade.
No single definition is entirely satisfactory; still, there has been some convergence in
opinion about what constitutes trust. Summarizing the views expressed at a Cambridge
conference on the subject, Gambetta (1988) gave the following definition: ``When we say
we trust someone or that someone is trustworthy, we implicitly mean that the probability
that he will perform an action that is beneficial. . . is high enough for us to consider in

engaging in some form of cooperation with him. Correspondingly, when we say that
someone is untrustworthy, we imply that that probability is low enough for us to refrain
from doing so.''
Even more controversial is the issue of what causes trust. In the popular press, trust is
most often taken as a primitive. This perspective is nicely summarized by Fukuyama
(1995) who analyzes social organizations as a function of whether societies are `hightrust' or `low-trust.' The determinants of trust are reduced to a murkily defined notion of
culture, which is taken as exogenous, as he states that ``community depends on trust, and
trust in turn is culturally determined.'' This view has also been expressed in the academic
literature. For example, sociologist Ronald Dore has written about Japan's Confucian
heritage as engendering trust in that society (Dore, 1987). Such heritage builds up over
time, through a series of historical experiences. In this paper, we use the term `historical
residue' to refer to the part of trust that is a consequence of such historical experiences.
At the other extreme, rational-thinking economists, building on the well-known 'Folk
Theorem,' (see, for example, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1992) assume trust to be a direct
result of the traditional economic assumptions of rational utility-maximization. Trust here
is essentially enforced cooperation based on repeated interaction and the possibility of
punishing cheaters in the future.
Recently, attempts have been made in the social sciences to look more broadly at the
sources of trust. It is commonly accepted that there must be some degree of `generalized
morality' operating that discourages opportunistic behavior (Granovetter, 1985). In terms
of personal relations, the types of trust given by Shapiro et al. (1992) are consistent with
much of the recent literature. They include: deterrence-based trust, which is based on the
threat of punishment if consistent behavior is not maintained (rational trust); knowledgebased trust, which occurs when each party has enough information about the other to
accurately predict the other's behavior; and identification-based trust, which results when
each party has fully internalized the other's preferences, so that one party may serve as
the other's agent, with the other being confident that her interests will be fully protected.
These sources of trust will each be affected by the institutional environment in which
they operate. In her study of trust production and destruction in the United States, Zucker
(1986) discusses a number of institutions that facilitate trust production. She examines the
effects of professional associations (professionalization) and of various insurance
mechanisms that increase the predictability of outcomes (intermediation). Shapiro
(1987) takes this work one step further by looking at the ways in which these `trustees of
trust' are themselves policed.
Theorists have pointed out that such (formal and informal) institutions help resolve
ubiquitous information and agency problems (North, 1990). Given this received wisdom,
the dearth of systematic empirical work that gets at the manner in which such institutions
operate is somewhat puzzling. This scarcity extends to the limited work on the
institutional determinants of trust. One factor that has been repeatedly emphasized in the
theoretical literature on the sources of trust is that of information. In this short paper, we
examine the trust-information relationship using cross-country data.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the theoretical
literature on trust and information. We show that the theory, with a few exceptions, points
to a positive trust-information relation; we also discuss some of the experimental

evidence in support of the theory. The issue of how important this effect is in the world
outside the laboratory remains unresolved, however. We present the data that we use to
address this question in Section 3. In Section 4, we examine the relationship between
aggregate expressions of trust (as evidenced in survey responses) and various measures of
telecommunications infrastructure. Our finding of a strong positive relationship between
trust and two-way information flows casts doubt upon the extreme viewpoint that trust is
purely a historical residue. We discuss implications of our result and future work in the
concluding section.
2. Theories of trust and information
We provide here brief descriptions of some of the dominant models of information and
cooperation in the social sciences as they pertain to the ideas of trust outlined above.
Obviously, we are not reviewing all such theories; rather, we outline a few models to
illustrate their general predictions regarding the trust-information relationship. The first
two categories reviewed below explicitly model the trust-information relationship; the
last category emphasizes trust as a consequence of historical processes.
2.1. Deterrence-based trust
A large body of literature considers the behavior of players in repeated prisoners'
dilemmas under imperfect information (Kreps et al. (1982)). It is intuitive that, if players
are less able to monitor the actions of others, there will be less cooperation (and hence
increased opportunistic behavior), since this makes it more difficult to ascertain whether
or not cheating has occurred. This intuition has been confirmed by Fudenberg et al.
(1994). Thus, this theory predicts a positive correlation between trust and information.1
2.2. Knowledge-based trust and identification-based trust
In both of these cases, it is straightforward that better information flows imply greater
trust, as both of these types of trust rely on learning about others' behaviors and
preferences.2 There is some experimental evidence that knowing others' preferences can
help coordination. Experimental economists have also reported the robust finding that
preplay communication leads to greater cooperation, even in situations where game
theory suggests that such communication is no more than cheap talk (Ledyard, 1995).
1
A body of literature outside economics also captures this idea. For example, social psychologists refer to
prisoners' dilemma situations as social dilemmas. The idea that deterrence helps resolve such dilemmas can be
found in several papers. See, for example, Yamagishi and Cook (1993).
2
At least some ex ante uncertainty is essential for this type of trust to develop, however, since it allows players
to observe how others behave when the possibility of opportunistic behavior exists. If there is no uncertainty,
individuals never get the chance to `prove themselves.' Kollock (1994) reports evidence supporting this claim
from a market game, where he finds that subjects rate their partners as significantly more trustworthy under
conditions of greater uncertainty. Note, however, that this argument does not apply to ex post uncertainty, so the
overall effect is unclear.

<-----Page 3----->82

One reason for this may be that preplay communication facilitates the formation of a
group identity.
The situation becomes more complicated when we move away from a simple model of
dyadic relations. In their work on third-party gossip, Burt and Knez (1996) study trust
between individuals embedded in a broader social network. Their survey results suggest
that trust is increasing in the frequency of interaction between the two parties involved.
However, interactions with third-parties (indirect connections) reinforce previously held
beliefs about whether or not the other party will cooperate in future interactions, thus
affecting trust intensity, not direction. Thus, some types of information flows reinforce
distrust as well as trust.
2.3. `Generalized morality'
The simple intuition here is that the average level of trust should be independent of
information flows. Fukuyama (1995) has argued that trust is the result of shared values
that allow individuals to subordinate their interests to those of larger groups, and that
these shared values are the result of historically determined cultural heritage. A similar
view is also expressed by Dore (1987). Several authors have suggested that humans will
often behave in ways which are not in their interest because they have evolved emotional
predispositions to do so (see, for example, Schelling, 1978; Akerlof, 1983; Frank, 1987;
Hirshleifer, 1987). These predispositions, including the propensity to behave nonopportunistically, have little to do with the availability of information.
However, there exist evolutionary models where an individual's level of trust is
exogenous, as suggested by these authors, but the proportion of trusting individuals in the
population depends on information flows. In Frank's (1987) model, players are either
honest or dishonest, and pair up to play a prisoner's dilemma. If information is readily
available, honest players are less likely to be fooled into being taken advantage of by
dishonest players. Thus, the average payoff to honest players will be higher if there are
reliable information flows, which increases the `reproductive fitness' of honest types.3
A few important observations regarding these theories are in order. Most of the above
explanations suggest a causal relationship in which information flows lead to greater
trust. However, it is important to note the possibility of reverse causality. As an
illustrative example, suppose that trust is, in fact, a historical residue. Suppose further that
less trusting types invest in obtaining information, feeling the need for monitoring to
reduce opportunism on the part of their exchange partners, while more trusting types do
not do so. Then this would lead to a negative correlation between information and trust in
which the direction of causality is the reverse of that implied by the above theories. This
example, by drawing on both the generalized morality and the deterrence based
3
There are some caveats to this kind of model, however. For example, Bendor et al. (1991) show that, under
increased uncertainty, more forgiving strategies tend to perform better in prisoners' dilemma tournaments (see
Axelrod, 1984, for a description of such tournaments). Therefore, more cooperative strategies will `survive'
more often under conditions of increased uncertainty. The intuition is that `suspicious' strategies will be too
quick to punish apparent defections, and will end up in a state of non-cooperation simply due to mistakes in
observing other players' behavior. Note that this will not necessarily imply more overall cooperation in
equilibrium, since both suspicious and forgiving strategies will end up cooperating less when there is more
uncertainty.

explanations, also illustrates the additional general point that not all theories predicting
correlations between trust and information fit neatly into the above three categories.
The theories positing a positive correlation between trust and information flows are not
always specific about the mechanism by which the information flows occur. For example,
they do not always distinguish between two-way private communication, as opposed to
one-way, or generalized, communication (such as through television or radio). Some
theoretical reasoning (Bolton, 1991; Roth, 1995) suggests that face to face communication allows parties to understand and empathize with one another, which affects the utility
each places on the other's outcome and contributes to the building of trust. Valley et al.
(1998) interpret their recent experimental results as providing evidence for the idea that
face-to-face communication appears to contribute to trust-building by increasing the
incentive for truth-telling. In their experiments, verbal exchanges emphasized the
interpersonal aspect of communication in ways that other communication mechanisms
did not. We have only approximate proxies for the prevalence of various means of
communicating information. Nonetheless, given the findings of (Valley et al., 1998) that
the medium of communication affects trust formation, we feel it important to be sensitive
to the distinction between one-way and two-way information flows in our estimations
below. The theoretical reasoning and experimental evidence suggest that the act of
information exchange through two-way communication media is more likely to be the
source of an information-trust correlation than is information exchange through one-way
communication media.
3. Data
Our basic design is to measure the relationship between information flows and trust
across countries. We take as our sample the forty countries covered in the World Values
Survey 1990±1993 (WVS), from which we obtain our measure of trust. Following La
Porta et al. (1997), TRUST is defined as the percentage of respondents in each country
who answered that most people can be trusted when asked, ``Generally speaking, would
you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful when dealing with
people?''. Summary statistics for TRUST, as well as our other variables, are listed in
Table 1, and Appendix A provides information on the World Values Survey.4
There are obvious limitations involved with any attempt to directly measure an
intangible attribute such as trust. In addition to the usual difficulties with using survey
data, there is the problem that the idea of trust may have different meanings across
cultures and across individuals. Moreover, for our purposes, the survey data is too coarse
in that it cannot differentiate between the types of trust outlined above.
We use phones per capita (PHONES), obtained from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Yearbook 1994, as a proxy for the level or importance of two-way
communication. The ITU Yearbook contains many other measures of communications
infrastructure, including phones per household, total calls per capita, faults per line, and
4
While the WVS provides survey data at the individual level, our study is limited to analyses at the country
level, since this is the level of aggregation of our communications infrastructure data.

TRUST values are obtained from the World Values Survey, 1990-1993, and represent the fraction of respondents
in each of 40 countries that answered in the affirmative to the question ``Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful when dealing with people?'' PHONES is the number
of telephones per capita, and is obtained from the International Telecommunications Union, 1993. GDP per
capita is in 1992 U.S. dollars. HIER is the fraction of individuals who are followers of a hierarchical religion
(Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox, and Islam), and is obtained from the Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations,
1995. URBAN is the percentage of individuals living in urban areas, and is obtained from the World Bank
Yearbook.

waiting time for telephone installation. They are all strongly correlated, and our results
are qualitatively unaffected by the measure of communications infrastructure used.5 The
results reported below use PHONES as the communications measure.
The one-way communications measures (as measured by newspaper circulation/capita,
radio availability/capital, or television availability/capita) are all highly correlated, and
are also highly correlated with PHONES (Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.71, 0.73,
and 0.76 for the correlation of PHONES with newspapers per capita, radios per capita,
and televisions per capita respectively, all significant at conventional levels). Even after
controlling for log (income), the correlation coefficients for the various one-way
communications measures with PHONES vary from 0.52 to 0.63, significant at
conventional levels. To some extent, the generalized morality source of trust could be
thought to be related to the one-way communication measures, but it is difficult to read
too much into this conclusion. In any event, we control for one-way communication
measures in the analysis below.
Both the theoretical and empirical literature suggest the presence of a cultural
component to trust. Huntington (1996) provides a coarse metric for differentiating
societies; he lists six basic cultures (CULTURE) ± Western, Orthodox, Sinic, Hindu,
African, and Latin American, as a means of grouping similar countries. TRUST statistics
broken down by CULTURE are listed in Table 2. The summary statistics suggest that the
mean trust level in Western countries is higher than that in any of the other culture
categories. The difference in means is statistically significant at conventional levels for
5
Admittedly, our t-values are higher for PHONES, though not the magnitude of the effect. This is probably
because other proxies are less easily measured, and are therefore noisier. For example, the reported number of
calls per capita varies by as much as an order of magnitude between years, for a given country. We attempted to
construct an aggregate index of communications infrastructure; however, it is not at all clear how to construct
such a measure. We also examined how other forms of infrastructure were related to trust, on the grounds that
these might facilitate economic activity and thus lead to greater interaction and thereby greater trust. Our
measures of transportation (roads, railroads), and energy production were found to be more or less orthogonal to
trust, once we controlled for income.

TRUST values are obtained from the World Values Survey, 1990±1993, and represent the fraction of respondents
in each of 40 countries that answered in the affirmative to the question ``Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful when dealing with people?'' Countries are
categorized into one of six cultures, as advocated by Huntington (1996). In this classification, Western countries
for which we have data are Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, and USA. The other categories of countries are: Sinic ± China, Japan, South Korea; Latin ±
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico; African ± Nigeria, South Africa; Orthodox ± Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Turkey; and Hindu ± India.

African or Orthodox countries on the other.
A different proxy for the cultural component of trust comes from Putnam (1993), who
argues that trust is a habit formed during generations of `horizontal networks of
association.' He further claims that the Catholic Church, by imposing a hierarchical
structure on society, has discouraged the formation of this `habit of trust.' La Porta et al.
(1997) argue that this assertion applies to any hierarchical religion. Based on this
premise, they take the percentage of the population belonging to a hierarchical religion
(HIER) as an `exogenous' measure of generalized trust.6 The correlation between TRUST
and HIER is ÿ0.61, providing some confirmation to the claim of (La Porta et al. (1997)).
Ability to communicate is only a part of the communally enforced cooperation that
may be considered `trust.' In larger, urban communities, social ties may be too diffuse to
effectively blacken a cheater's reputation through word-of-mouth communication (see,
for example, Kandori, 1992). In other words, an individual may act dishonestly for a long
time before his reputation catches up with him. By contrast, in a rural village, ostracism is
easily facilitated. To account for this effect, we use the percent of a country's population
living in urban areas. The WVS data also include the size of the community where each
interview took place. Univariate comparisons of mean TRUST levels across different
community sizes (Table 3) do not, however, suggest any striking relationship between
mean trust levels and community size. We note that caution is in order in interpreting
these statistics, because of the strong positive urbanization-income and income-trust
relationships.
Research on telecommunications infrastructure in Japan by Imagawa (1997) suggests
that phone usage is complementary to urbanization, i.e., telephones are a more dominant
means of communication in urban areas. If this were the case, we would expect the

Hierarchical religion is defined here as Catholic, Moslem, or Orthodox. They note, however, that most of the
correlation between HIER and TRUST is driven by the correlation between Catholicism and trust.

marginal effect of phones on trust to be affected by the level of urbanization (URBAN).
To account for this effect, we include a PHONES  URBAN interaction terms in some of
the regressions below.
The nature of the data affects the kinds of empirical analyses that are possible. With the
exception of the idea of generalized morality, the theories in Section 2 are at a micro
level, whereas our empirical results are based on coarser data aggregates. As an example
of where this disjunction between the extant theories and available data might be relevant,
consider the distinction drawn in social psychology between generalized exchange and
restricted exchange (Ekeh, 1974), and between different kinds of generalized exchange.7
In experimental settings, some authors have shown that the effect of information flows on
the levels of cooperation depend upon the kind of exchange (Yamagishi and Cook, 1993),
and the nature of the communication medium (Valley et al., 1998). However, our data
precludes us from conditioning our estimations on the particulars of the micro situation.
Consequently, we are unable to address the possibility that the trust-information
correlations (and the underlying reasons for these correlations) may differ across
circumstances within a particular country.

Here restricted exchange between two agents refers to a situation where each agent's contribution is directly
related to that of the other, whereas generalized exchange situations are characterized by no such direct
relationship.

relationship, controlling for log (GDP per capita). In both cases, a positive linear relation
is apparent.
The regression results of the three baseline models are shown in Table 4; the
coefficient on PHONES is positive in all regressions. This result is robust to specification,
significant at the 1% level in all three models. The effect is also large, with the coefficient
ranging from 0.67 to 0.77. In more concrete terms, this implies that a move from the
mean to the 75th percentile (an increase in per capita telephones of 0.2) will increase the
percent of `trusting individuals' by 13 to 15 percent. The interaction term
(URBAN  PHONES) is also positive and statistically significant (p  0.038), and large
in magnitude. Its size implies that a 5% increase in urbanization will raise the marginal
effect of communication on trust by 1%. To illustrate, for countries at the 25th percentile
level of urbanization, an increase of per capita phones of 0.2 will raise the level of
trust by 9%, whereas for countries at the 75th percentile, the same increase in phones will
yield an increase in trust of 17%. Once other factors are accounted for, there is at best a
weak link between income and trust. Thus, our results strongly suggest a positive
relationship between ability to communicate and level of perceived trust. We note also
that the CULTURE fixed effects are jointly significant at the 1% level in all these
specifications.
Table 5 shows the results when HIER is used to proxy for a cultural effect. The
coefficient on PHONE remains positive and significant in all the estimations. The
magnitude on those estimations that include HIER is reduced relative to the estimations
that used CULTURE fixed effects. For example, it is reduced from 0.67 in Table 4, Model
3, to 0.34 in Table 5, Model 4. Even at this attenuated level, however, note that the
magnitude of the PHONE effect remains strong (evaluated at their respective means, the
PHONE effect is of comparable magnitude to the HIER effect). Another difference in
Table 5 is that the PHONES  URBAN effect is smaller in magnitude and significance.

These results are qualitatively unchanged if we include CULTURE fixed effects and
HIER in the same specifications.8
Finally, in all the specifications in Tables 4 and 5, we include measures of one-way
communication in addition to PHONES. Our results are qualitatively unchanged, and the
one-way communication measures are not significant at conventional levels.
The robust positive correlation between TRUST and a measure of two-way
communication is consistent with the predictions of most of the theories discussed in
Section 2. For example, it is consistent with the deterrence-based story that the existence
of phones (or, more generally, of communications means for which PHONES is a proxy)
discourages opportunistic behavior on the grounds that it is more likely to be discovered,
and thereby contributes to a greater level of trust. But a degree of circumspection is in
order here, as there are a variety of underlying mechanisms that are consistent with this
result, and our data do not permit us to identify some subset of these as operative in our
data to the exclusion of others.
As discussed earlier, it is also appropriate to recognize that there may not be a direct
causal link between information flows and trust (as implied by the theories in Section 2).
For example, a behavioral explanation (not posited by the theories above) consistent with
our results is that phones allow exchange with strangers, and such repeated exchange
contributes to trust.9 Here `exchange with strangers' is the unobserved variable that
accounts for the correlation between information and trust.
8
Note that, because of the high correlation between HIER or CULTURE fixed effects on the one hand, and
PHONES on the other (e.g. HIER and PHONES have a correlation coefficient of 0.47, significant at the 1%
level), it is not possible to meaningfully examine how much of the variation each of these variables
independently explain.

5. Conclusions
Several theories proposed by economists and sociologists predict a positive relationship between trust and information flows. We view this short paper as providing useful
confirmation of this prediction. We also find that this effect is particularly strong in
highly urbanized countries. It is surely true that trust is a complicated attribute, and that
several factors other than the availability of information flows affect trust levels.
However, we view the results as challenging the notion that trust is purely a historical
residue.
Our results have important implications in a number of areas. In particular, the
transactions costs theory of the firm has long claimed that the inability to write
enforceable and complete contracts is a fundamental reason for the existence of firms.
The easier it is to write such contracts, the more easily transactions may take place across
organizational boundaries (and, more generally, between individuals). Trust, by
substituting for formal contract enforcement, may affect the types of organizational
forms that emerge across different societies.10
These results point to a few interesting future directions. Most of the results we have
reported here involve only highly aggregated data from the World Values Survey.
If we are able to develop a proxy for information flows for states or provinces within
some subset of our countries, we would be able to estimate a model that allows for
country fixed effects. We may also wish to look for data that provides a different measure
of trust. For example, data on loans between friends may be a more meaningful
measure of trust than one based on survey results. Finally, we are not able, given the
nature of our data, to distinguish between the various theories that predict a positive
relationship between trust and information flows. Further experimental studies designed
to better identify these components of observed trust would be complementary to our
own effort.

As an example, consider the business groups that dominate the private sectors of most developing countries.
Several authors have emphasized the role of trust in cementing relationships between firms belonging to a
particular business group (see Leff, 1978; Granovetter, 1994; Khanna and Palepu, 1997; Ghemawat and Khanna,
1998 and the references therein). As another example, note the focus placed by organizational behavior scholars
on the importance of trust in relational contracting. In forming lateral contracts, trust is essential (Sheppard and
Tuchinsky, 1996), and without it, the network forms of organization that have received so much attention lately
(see, for example, Powell and Smith-Doerr, 1994; Uzzi, 1996) cannot be sustained.

Appendix
The World Values Survey (WVS) is a database compiled by the Institute for Social
Research at the University of Michigan. According to the WVS codebook, the purpose of
the database is, ``to enable crossnational comparison of values and norms in a wide
variety of areas and to monitor changes in values and attitudes of mass publics in 40
societies around the world. Broad topics covered are work, the meaning and purpose of
life, family life, and contemporary social issues.''
The population in the WVS included adults 18 and over, selected through random
sampling. As noted in the codebook, rural areas and the illiterate were undersampled (the
latter is not a problem for us, as it increases the comparability of observations across
countries).
Weights were provided to further scale observations to better reflect a country's
demographic distributions. Since the weighted and unweighted measures of TRUST were
highly correlated (  0.9948), we report the unweighted values for simplicity (of course,
none of results change if the weighted values are used).
