Abstract

Is there such a thing as management 'expertise'? What are its characteristics? This paper examines four aspects of how
management expertise is developed from management experience: the task specificity of experience, multiple types of
experience, depth vs. breadth of experience and the impact of experience over time. It identifies issues associated with the
study of management expertise and suggests approaches for further behavioral and technical research in this area. In
particular, a situated learning approach is appropriate to formulate and explore the relationships between management
experience, expertise and performance and a case-based reasoning approach is appropriate as a representation and modeling
mechanism. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction

The proliferation of computers on managers' desks
and the success in providing intelligent tools for
professional domains such as finance, accounting
and engineering, have sparked interest in the computer-based representation of management expertise.
Before managerial judgment and decision-making
can be modeled, however, it must be understood.
Management expertise has been much less studied
than professional expertise. Can conventional assumptions be applied to management? Is there even
such a thing as management 'expertise'? What are its
characteristics?
This paper examines the nature of management
expertise and how it is acquired or developed through
managerial experience. The objective is to review
recent empirical research in order to identify the
issues that must be paid attention to if examinations

of specific computerized requirements and capabilities are to be both relevant and realistic.
To start, two terms need to be defined. The first
term is 'expertise'. Various definitions are possible,
although there tends to be two distinct views [I-3].
A cognitive-based view defines expertise as the
"possession of an organized body of conceptual and
procedural knowledge than can be readily accessed
and used with superior monitoring and self-regulation skills" ([4], p. xxi). A performance-based
view defines expertise as the "ability, acquired by
practice, to perform qualitatively well in a particular
task domain" ([5], p. 158).
These two views of expertise are not inconsistent.
The first definition emphasizes and measures cognitive attributes, presuming that they lead to superior
performance, whereas the second definition emphasizes and measures performance, presuming that it is
a consequence of cognitive attributes. Both views
emphasize that expertise is developed or acquired
through experience. A performance-based definition
of expertise will be used in this paper. In real-world

domains such as management there are likely to be
significant differences in learning ability and expertise among individuals with different amounts of
experience [6,7], and so performance differences
should be explicitly studied. Management expertise
is therefore considered to be demonstrated by effective management performance.
The second term to be defined is 'management'.
There are various ways to define what 'management'
consists of, in terms of both jobs and activities. For
the purpose of this paper, a manager is anyone who
is deemed to be a manager, and 'management' consists of those jobs which are considered to be managerial. This nominalist definition is consistent with
the definition used in studies of managerial work (for
example [8,9]) and allows an examination of management that reflects its diversity, both horizontally
across organizations and vertically within organizations.
The remainder of the paper examines the characteristics of management expertise and discusses how
it is acquired through experience. Four different
aspects of the experiential nature of management
expertise are described in Sections 2-5: the task
specificity of experience, multiple types of experience, depth vs. breadth of experience and the impact
of experience over time. The implications of the
paper for the study and the representation of management expertise, respectively, are then presented.
The paper ends with a summary.

2. Task specificity of experience
Expertise is normally defined on narrow taskspecific domains and is seen as being acquired on
the basis of experience in these domains [5,4]. In
non-managerial, professional fields, task specificity
is a key component of the study of expertise. In fact,
recent reviews of empirical research on expertise in
professional accounting have called for increased
task analysis [10,11]. The rationale for this is that the
knowledge and skill requirements of a task can be
better specified once it has been determined what
must be done to perform the task.
Should there be a similar emphasis on task analysis when management expertise is being examined?
If management expertise is the ability to perform
management tasks well, a key issue to be addressed

is what the relevant managerial tasks are. This leads
directly to a consideration of the nature of managerial work.
A consistent finding from recent reviews of over
30 empirical studies of managerial work is that
managerial work is contextually-dependent, rather
than task-dependent [8,12]. Work requirements vary
considerably, depending on functional area, management level, and organizational attributes such as
type, structure, size and industry. The most effective
managerial skills are specific to particular contexts,
such as industries and organizations, rather than
being generalizable across contexts. This differs from
professional fields such as accounting and engineering, where the emphasis is on developing skills that
can be applied to many different situations.
The contextual nature of managerial work is exacerbated by its individuality. An important aspect of
managerial work is choosing and negotiating just
what is to be done by the manager [8,12]. Thus,
managerial work will be shaped by the style and
preferences of the person in the job and there can be
significant differences in how two people carry out
what is nominally the same job [13].
Finally, it is difficult to delineate management
work along task lines because there are many different tasks at different levels of aggregation. For example, one relevant activity or task might be business start-up. This task could be decomposed into
other tasks, such as developing a business plan,
obtaining financing, seeking a location, putting together a management team, and so on. Each of these
tasks could be further decomposed to lower levels,
where the bottom level would consist of basic tasks
such as reading, writing and making telephone calls.
This kind of decomposition is arbitrary in nature. It
is also unlikely to be useful, since it is unlikely that
task performance at the bottom level can be aggregated up. For example, making telephone calls may
be a significant component task of putting together a
management team, hut one is not able to infer skill at
the latter task from evidence of skill at the former. In
addition, the core of much managerial work is the
integration of separate on-going tasks that may be
performed by different people at different times,
rather than the completion of standalone tasks.
Thus, the most important management knowledge
and skills transcend, integrate and customize particu-

<-----Page 2----->R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

lar tasks, and so an emphasis on task-specificity for
the development of managerial expertise is misplaced. Instead, emphasis should be placed on the
particular settings or contexts in which managerial
work is carried out. Local knowledge of particular
jobs, organizations and industries is likely to be more
consequential for the development and demonstration of management expertise than is task-specific
knowledge. This is particularly pronounced at higher
management levels, where there is less structure and
more discretion [12]. Lower level managerial jobs
often involve a large proportion of technical or professional work, and so the required expertise may be
more technical or professional in nature, rather than
managerial.
The de-emphasis of task as a unit of analysis in
studying management expertise is supported by three
studies of the practical intelligence, or tacit knowledge, of managers. The premise behind the three
studies is that real-world success in managerial endeavors requires 'tacit knowledge'--knowledge
which is practical rather than academic in nature and
is experientially acquired, rather than directly taught
[14,15].
In the first study, a tacit knowledge instrument
was administered to managers of varying experience
levels [ 15]. The instrument consisted of scenarios of
job-related situations, together with a list of possible
responses to each scenario, and the managers rated
the importance of each response. Responses that
differentiated between the managers' experience levels constituted the tacit knowledge scale. Findings
indicated that tacit knowledge was related positively
to job performance within experiential levels, leading
to the conclusion that "differences in tacit knowledge were consequential for career performance"
([15], p. 452). This study therefore indicates that it is
both possible and relevant to identify management
expertise independently of task.
In the second study, tacit knowledge was investigated in more detail. Several models of the structure
of tacit knowledge were examined, ranging from a
model of general ability (managers who are good at
one thing tend to be good at other things) to a model
that is completely task specific (being good at one
thing is not related to being good at other things).
Findings from the responses of managers supported
the model of general ability: "individual differences

53

in tacit knowledge are best described in terms of a
general ability of fund of knowledge, as opposed to a
collection of independent abilities or funds of knowledge" ([16], p. 1246). This study indicates more
directly that at least some consequential management
expertise is not task-specific.
Finally, in the third study, a tacit knowledge
instrument was developed for and administered to a
diverse group of business owners of varying experience levels [17]. A separate tacit knowledge scale
was formed for retailers and manufacturers. Like the
first two studies, this study found that tacit knowledge of the owner's o w n sector was related to
performance--firm performance in this case. However, it was also found that tacit knowledge of the
o t h e r sector was related neither to tacit knowledge in
the owners' own sector nor to performance. This
study therefore indicates that relevant management
expertise is sector-specific, and that consequential
knowledge for retailers differs from consequential
knowledge for manufacturers.
Thus, to summarize, key management expertise is
more likely to be context-specific rather than taskspecific, and is likely to vary among different situations. For example, project management expertise in
the R & D group of a biotechnology finn is likely to
differ significantly from project management expertise in the Information Systems group of a bank.
Although project managers in the two situations may
use similar techniques (for example, PERT charts),
they will need a detailed understanding of different
organizations, technologies and environments in order to make effective judgements and decisions. This
implies that studies of management expertise may
not be generalizable beyond the context(s) investigated. It also implies that understanding management
expertise requires a specialized contextual analysis
rather than a generic task analysis.

3. Multiple types of experience
Section 2 concluded that task-specific expertise is
less likely to be relevant in management work than
contextually-specific expertise. How is this contextually-specific expertise acquired? It is generally acknowledged that expertise in a domain is acquired

<-----Page 3----->54

R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

through experience in that domain, ls this true of
management?
Practitioners appear to believe that experience is
consequential. Certainly descriptions of and advertisements for managerial jobs highlight experience
and even specific types of experience as required or
desired qualifications. In addition, investors such as
venture capitalists are consistently found to believe
that a business owner's experience is important to
the subsequent success of the firm [18-20].
If managerial work requires extensive contextual
knowledge--local knowledge at the job, organization and industry level--then management expertise
is likely to be multi-dimensional and acquired through
multiple types of experiences. What types of experiences are relevant?
Two studies of lower level managers report that
job-specific experience is important. The first study
asked officers on U.S. Navy ships to rate the extent
to which they had learned various roles of their job
[21]. The results indicated that time-on-the-job on a
particular ship explained the most variance (27%) of
these ratings. The second study, of restaurant managers, examined the relationship of job performance
with three different experience measures: length of
time with the organization, length of time as a
restaurant manager, and length of time managing the
current restaurant [22]. The results indicated that
job-specific experience (experience as a restaurant
manager) predicted stronger performance, while
length of time with the organization and with the
current restaurant did not. Since experience as a
restaurant manager combines both managerial experience (i.e. experience supervising others) and industry experience (i.e. experience in restaurants), it is
unclear whether it is one or both aspects of experience as a restaurant manager that are valuable.
One would expect that a broader set of experiences would be relevant at higher managerial levels,
and, indeed, a much broader set has been investigated in the entrepreneurship literature [2326,20,27,28]. For the most part, these studies have
examined the relationship between the experience of
the founder prior to starting the firm, and subsequent firm performance. The focus is on prior experience because of interest on the part of lenders and
investors in being able to pick winners before committing resources to a new venture.

Firm performance is used in these studies as a
proxy for the performance of the business owner. It
is a reasonable proxy and is preferable to attempting
to measure owners' performance directly. The reason
for this is that managerial work is inherently difficult
and ambiguous to measure. Since it is complex,
inter-related and shared, it is difficult to isolate
performance on particular activities and performance
of particular individuals. However, measures of firm
performance avoid these difficulties. They reflect
performance on all activities, including the setting of
priorities among activities and the delegation of activities to others.
The types of prior experiences that have been
studied include: management or supervisory experience, start-up experience, ownership experience,
small business experience, large business experience
and industry experience. More detailed types of industry experience have also been studied, such as
prior experience with similar customers, similar
products and services, similar suppliers and similar
technology.
The findings of this body of literature, collectively, are mixed and inconsistent, largely because of
differences in bow experience and performance is
defined across studies [7,29]. However, there is fairly
persistent evidence of a significant and positive relationship between firm performance and some types
of prior experience--in particular, prior supervisory,
industry and start-up experience [24,25,27]. In addition, there is evidence that entrepreneurs themselves
rate these types of experiences as valuable [30].
Thus, the most relevant types of experience appear to
be industry-specific and job-specific.
Two recent studies looked more closely at entrepreneurial experience, managerial expertise and
firm performance and found that expertise was related to both experience and performance [24,29].
This supports the notion that expertise is a mediating
factor, produced by experience and, in turn, producing enhanced performance outcomes. Moreover, the
second study found that specific types of experience
were associated with specific types of expertise [29].
For example, start-up experience is significantly correlated with expertise in areas emphasized during the
start-up process--feasibility analysis, developing
global operations/markets, financial analysis and financing-while large firm experience is signifi-

<-----Page 4----->R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

cantly correlated with expertise in areas emphasized
by large organizations--strategic planning and financing.
Some types of expertise, but not all types, are
related to firm performance [29]. For example, owner
expertise in strategic planning, developing a business
plan, developing global markets/operations, financing and strategic alliance formation are all related to
firm performance for biotechnology and telecommunications companies--industries where these skills
are expected to be particularly important. On the
other hand, expertise in back office functions such as
office procedures and inventory control are not related and are not expected to be related to finn
performance in these industries.
Thus, to summarize, managerial experience and
managerial expertise are both multi-dimensional in
nature. Different types of experience leads to the
acquisition of different types of expertise, which, in
turn, can have differential impacts on performance.
This implies that studies of management expertise
need to define multiple measures of experience, expertise and performance. It also implies that the
expected relationships between experience, expertise
and performance need to be conceptually formulated
for each management context studied.
4. Breadth vs. depth of experience
As more types of experiences are found to be
related to managerial expertise a n d / o r managerial
performance, the question of depth vs. breadth of
experience becomes salient. There is just not as
much repetition in managerial activities as there is in
domains where expertise has been studied traditionally. For example, master chess players have typically spent 30,000 hours playing chess [31] and
radiologists have seen about 10,000 X-rays during
their training and 200,000 over a career [32]. On the
other hand, it is estimated that even the most experienced auditor rarely has experience with the audits
of more than 20 clients and 10 to 15 audits per year
[331.
The typical manager would have experience with
even fewer management objects such as organizations, employees, projects, branches, brands or accounts. Even regular activities such as preparing a
strategic plan or capital budget, forecasting sales, or

55

hiring/firing staff are carried out relatively int'requently. Larger scale endeavours, such as opening
new locations, introducing new product lines, starting new businesses or entering new markets, which
paradoxically require greater expertise, are carried
out even more infrequently. In developing management expertise, then, are smaller amounts of more
types of experience preferable to larger amounts of
fewer types of experience?
The findings of a study of experiential managerial
learning indicate that the answer to this question is
'yes' [34]. The study found that the most profound
managerial learning stemmed from diversity: from
dealing with different people in different roles (i.e.
different types of bosses, subordinates or customers),
from having to manage situations of high stress and
high stakes, from handling adverse business conditions and from having to establish or re-establish
credibility. A diversity of experiences provides exposure to a wide variety of situations, both positive and
negative, and it is through surviving and understanding novel situations that managerial learning takes
place [35,34]. Indeed, studies of managerial learning
experiences indicate that surviving setbacks or failure can be a particularly valuable learning experience [36,34,30].
A high degree of repetition might even be dysfunctional. Many managerial contexts require innovation and creativity as well as repetition and routinization [35,12]. However, a greater reliance on the
proceduralized knowledge and automatic cognitive
processing that stem from repetition, can lead to a
loss of flexibility in thinking, especially "when new
knowledge has to be created to optimally adapt to a
particular problem situation" ([5], p. 177).
Accordingly, in order to learn, managers may
need exposure to many different situations, more
than they need in-depth experience with only a few
situations. There is some evidence that mere exposure, as opposed to sustained activity, is beneficial.
For example, negotiation skills, which have been
identified as important management skills [24], can
be significantly improved after only one negotiation
experience [37],
Thus, to summarize, managers experience repetitive situations relative infrequently. Moreover, managerial learning occurs in novel rather than routine
situations. This implies that management experience

<-----Page 5----->56

R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

cannot serve as a proxy for management expertise. It
also implies that it might be valuable to identify and
count concrete experiences, when studying management expertise, rather than measuring their duration.

5. Impact of experience over time
If experience does lead to the development of
expertise, a final issue is whether the relationship
between them is linear. An example, adapted from
[38], will illustrate this more fully. Assume that a
new manager is hired at the beginning of each year
for four years. At the end of the fourth year, the least
experienced manager has only 25% as much experience as the most experienced manager (1 year vs. 4
years), but at the end of ten years, the least experienced manager has 60% as much experience as the
most experienced manager (6 years vs. 10 years).
How are these experiential differences likely to relate to differences in expertise?
There are three potential relationships between
experience and expertise. The first is that the relationship is linear, and the differences in expertise
between the most experienced and the least experienced manager are constant throughout the ten year
period. A second possible relationship is that there
are diminishing returns to experience over time due
to a learning curve effect, where the most intense
learning period is at the beginning of tenure in a
particular context. There will be differences in expertise between the most experienced and the least
experienced manager at the end of the fourth year
but few or no differences at the end of the tenth year.
Finally, a third possibility is that demonstrated expertise actually declines over time with experience in a
job, because motivational factors--for example,
boredom, come into play to a greater extent. In this
case, the more experienced manager might perform
better than the least experienced manager at the end
of the fourth year, but not as well at the end of the
tenth year.
Studies in non-managerial settings have examined
these relationships; in particular, the relationship between job experience on the one hand, and job
knowledge and job performance on the other. Findings indicate that job experience is positively related
to job knowledge up to five years of experience, at
which point a plateau is reached [39]. In addition,

experience is most closely related to job performance
in samples with low mean levels of job experience
[38]. In other words, these studies have found that
there are diminishing returns to experience, and that
additional experience is more consequential for performance at lower experiential levels.
These findings raise the question of whether similar results would be found with managers. Studies of
Navy officers [21] and restaurant managers [22] found
a positive relationship between job experience and,
respectively, the extent to which the job was learned
and job performance. However, in the former study
job assignments were all less than 32 months long
and in the latter study the average job experience
was 2.2 years, with a standard deviation of 2.84
years. Both of these time periods are likely to be too
short for diminishing returns to become evident.
A study of founders of high technology firms
provides support for the notion that the managerial
learning process is continuous [30]. Diminishing returns to managerial experience should be evident
among business owners. It is reasonable to expect a
very intense learning period when a firm is new and
experiences are novel, with less learning taking place
as the founder has owned the firm for a longer
period of time and activity becomes more predictable.
The founders were asked to rate the value of
different learning experiences in both their prior
work place and in the current firm they had started.
The results indicate that there are no significant
differences in how owners of newer firms and owners of older firms rate learning experiences in the
current firm. 'Newer' and 'older' were defined by
dividing the sample in half based on the age of the
firm. Newer firms are less than or equal to eight
years old, while older firms had been founded more
than eight years previous to data collection. Given
that previous plateaus in experiential learning have
been found at the five year level, the lack of differences among these two groups strongly suggests that
there are no diminishing returns to experience.
This study also examines another aspect of the
impact of experience over time. It examines the
'shelf-life' of experience, the length of time that a
particular type of experience remains valuable. In
order to assess the shelf-life of experience, a comparison was made of the ratings of experiences in the

<-----Page 6----->R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

prior work place by owners of newer and older
firms. There were significant differences, with owners of newer firms rating experiences in a prior work
place higher than do owners of older firms. Since
chi-square tests indicate there are no significant differences between the two groups with respect to
amounts of previous experience, these differences
can be assumed to stem from the age of experience
rather than from the a m o u n t of it. This finding is
supported by another study of founders of high-technology firms [40]. Here, prior experience is found to
have a positive impact on firm performance, but only
in the short term (two to four years).
To summarize, research on the impact of managerial experience over time is consistent with the contextual nature of management expertise. Experience
in a previous context becomes less valuable as the
manager gains experience with a new context. However, old experiences are replaced with new experiences which are more relevant to the current context.
Managers are therefore engaged in a continuous
experiential learning process in order to deal with the
dynamic and changeable nature of managerial problems and activities [35,8,34,12]. This implies that
management expertise is continually changing. It
also implies that studies of management expertise
need to timestamp any experience data collected.

6. Implications for the study of management expertise
This review has identified four major characteristics of management expertise:
1. it is context-specific rather than task-specific;
2. it can be acquired through multiple types of experience;
3. it can be acquired through novel situations rather
than repetitiveness;
4. it is acquired continuously, with no diminishing
returns to experience.
In examining these characteristics, a key question
that comes to mind is whether such a thing as
management 'expertise' can even be said to exist.
The fact that it is context-specific rather than taskspecific, in itself, appears to violate part of the
definition of expertise, which highlights performance
in a particular task domain. Certainly the relationships between experience and expertise are different

57

for management than they are for many other domains, including professional domains such as accounting and engineering. These relationships for
management are contingent, multiple, multi-dimensional, irregular and dynamic. It is misleading to use
managerial experience as a proxy for managerial
expertise.
One possible way to address the labelling issue is
to replace 'expertise' with a term such as 'knowledge, skills and abilities'. Management knowledge,
skills and abilities can be said to have all the characteristics previously ascribed to management expertise, and in fact, 'expertise' and 'skill' have been
explicitly used synonymously in the psychology literature [5]. The advantage of using the more colloquial term is that it is less associated with particular
experiential relationships that may not hold for management expertise. The disadvantage of using the
more colloquial term is the obverse of this: it has
few conceptual or theoretical underpinnings. Thus, it
is difficult to specify the expected relationships between managerial knowledge, skills and abilities on
the one hand, and managerial experience and performance on the other.
An alternative solution is to replace the cognitive
psychology perspective on expertise with a different
one; in particular, a social cognition perspective. A
promising approach here is the situated learning
approach [41], where learning is seen as occurring
through participation and membership in a community of practice. "Developing an identity as a member of a community and becoming knowledgeably
skilful are part of the same process, with the former
motivating, shaping, and giving meaning to the latter, which it subsumes" ([41], p. 65).
This perspective is well-suited to management in
two ways. First, the situated learning approach explicitly recognizes the importance of the social, cultural and historical context in which learning takes
place and performance occurs. Exposure to, and
membership within, different kinds of communities
where different skills are valued, will be associated
with the development of different types of expertise.
For example, managers in large corporations are
more likely to develop expertise in strategic planning
than are managers in small companies, because
strategic planning is more frequent, more visible and
more important in large corporations.

<-----Page 7----->58

R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

Second, a situated learning approach recognizes
that existing practices constrain and enable individuals to have certain learning experiences at the same
time as individuals are transforming these very practices. This permits a definition of expertise that
includes creativity and innovation, as well as repetition and routinization.
Thus, the situated learning approach is a promising approach for study of management expertise. It is
consistent with the four characteristics of management expertise identified above. Expertise is seen as
context-specific and continuously acquired. In addition, expertise is seen as being acquired through
multiple experiences, which have varying degrees of
repetitiveness associated with them.

7. Implications for the provision of computerbased decision aids
This examination of the characteristics of management expertise yields three suggestions for the
provision of computer-based decision aids. The first
suggestion is to avoid representing managerial expertise at all, instead focusing on developing generic,
user-friendly tools that can be customized by managers for their own use. The rationale behind this
suggestion is that managerial expertise is inherently
too complex, too personal, and too dynamic to be
usefully modeled in a single way. Instead, managers
should be provided with intelligent, easy-to-use tools
that enable them to model aspects of their expertise.
This is not new, of course--a spreadsheet is a good
example of a computer-based tool that has little
semantic content other than knowledge of its own
syntax. However, the lack of semantic content allows
the technology to be useful in diverse managerial
settings.
If more direction a n d / o r prescription is desired of
the system, then a second suggestion is to specify
clearly the expected skills of the person who is to
interact with it. Although information systems theory
and practice have emphasized the importance of
designing technology with close attention to the users
of the system, it is normally socio-technical considerations such as work flow and work relationships
that are paid most attention to, rather than the skill
requirements of the person specifying inputs to decision models.

However, since managerial decision contexts are
often relatively unstructured, system inputs can be
both highly judgmental and critical to system outputs. For example, the decision of whether to introduce a new product might involve subjective judgments about many input parameters, such as the
characteristics of the target market, the influence of
adopters on non-adopters, the influence of other
product developments or of advertising strategies,
the expected growth in retail outlets, the expected
volume of replacement sales, and so on, and the
quality of these judgments will heavily impact the
quality of the system outputs [42]. One would expect
that the required judgments would be influenced by
the experience, and in turn expertise, of the marketing managers, and there is empirical evidence that
this is the case [42]. For example, Perkins and Rao
[43] found that marketing managers who had more
brand management experience differed significantly
from less experienced managers in terms of how
they evaluated and used information in new product
decisions.
Thus, in cases where the information and predictions of a system are sensitive to the value of the
input parameters, and these values are subject to
managerial judgment, system designers need to specify the type of managerial experience a n d / o r expertise required to make the system operate effectively.
Failure to do so could result in systems that are
unreliable or that do not perform as well as managers
with the requisite knowledge, skills or abilities.
Finally, the third suggestion is that case-based
reasoning [44,45] appears well-suited to the representation of management expertise. A case-based reasoner makes decisions in one situation on the basis
of past experiences (cases). The critical aspect of
case-based reasoning is memory, which is considered
to be dynamic and continually changing with new
experiences: "there is no permanent (i.e., unchangeable) data structure in memory that exists solely for
processing purposes" ([45], p. 18). Individual experiences are encoded (or 'indexed') in memory on the
basis of their salient characteristics, are integrated
with existing memory structures using these indices,
and are then available for retrieval through the indices in subsequent problem-solving.
A case-based reasoner solves problems by adapting solutions that were used to solve previous cases.

<-----Page 8----->R. Reuber / Decision Support Systems 21 (1997) 51-60

As the reasoner evaluates decision outcomes, the
indices assigned to previous cases m a y change [44].
For example, indices for particular experiences will
be added to, deleted from, or modified w h e n the
reasoner comes to realize that these experiences have
been applied successfully (or unsuccessfully) to a
n e w situation. In other words, the reasoner continually evaluates n e w situations in light of old situations
and re-evaluates old situations in light of n e w situations.
Like the situated learning approach, case-based
reasoning shares characteristics of the managerial
learning process, suggests that it is well-suited for
the representation of m a n a g e m e n t expertise. Casebased reasoning relies on rich, m u l t i - d i m e n s i o n a l
classifications to r e m e m b e r old experiences. It permits reasoning in situations where there has been
little experience; a smaller case base is used. Indeed,
negative outcomes, which have been f o u n d to be
salient to managers [36,34,30] are also salient to
case-based reasoners [45,46], and so learning for
both can be especially triggered by failure. Finally,
through its re-evaluation m e c h a n i s m , case-based reasoning supports c o n t i n u o u s learning, and the replacement of older experiences with more recent and
more relevant experiences,

8. Summary
This paper has reviewed four aspects of how
m a n a g e m e n t expertise is developed from m a n a g e m e n t experience: the task specificity of experience,
multiple types of experience, depth vs. breadth of
experience and the impact of experience over time. It
has c o n c l u d e d that m a n a g e m e n t expertise is
context-specific rather than task-specific, can be acquired through multiple types of experience, can be
acquired through novel situations rather than repetitiveness and is acquired c o n t i n u o u s l y , with no d i m i n ishing returns to experience.
These characteristics suggest that certain approaches are appropriate for the study and m o d e l i n g
of m a n a g e m e n t expertise. In particular, a situated
learning approach is appropriate to formulate and
explore the relationships b e t w e e n m a n a g e m e n t experience, expertise and performance, and a case-based
reasoning approach is appropriate as a representation
and m o d e l i n g m e c h a n i s m .
