TRUST REPAIR AFTER AN ORGANIZATIONLEVEL FAILURE
NICOLE GILLESPIE
University of Melbourne
GRAHAM DIETZ
Durham University
We propose a systemic, multilevel framework for understanding trust repair at the
organizational level. Drawing on systems theory, we theorize how each component of
an organization’s system shapes employees’ perceptions of the organization’s trustworthiness and can contribute to failures and effective trust repair. We distinguish the
framework from prior work grounded in dyadic assumptions and propose underlying
principles and a four-stage process for organizational trust repair. Finally, we explore
the implications for research and practice.

A fundamental assumption inherent in most
employment relationships is that the employer
will operate in a trustworthy manner (Galford &
Drapeau, 2003). High trust levels are common
early in such relationships (Robinson, 1996),
with trustworthiness a “given” in the absence of
contrary evidence (McKnight, Cummings, &
Chervany, 1998). But what happens when one’s
employer acts in a manner that undermines this
perception of trustworthiness?
Prominent examples of such incidents—what
we term organization-level failures—include accounting frauds (e.g., Enron, WorldCom, Parmalat); deceit (e.g., plagiarized and fabricated reports by the New York Times); incompetence
(e.g., the U.S. Federal Emergency Management
Agency’s response to Hurricane Katrina); fatal,
avoidable accidents (e.g., Union Carbide’s
chemical spill at Bhopal, BP’s Texas City refinery fire, Townsend Thoresen/P&O’s ferry sinking
at Zeebrugge); exploitation of vulnerable people
(e.g., use of child labor sweatshops); massive
compulsory job losses (e.g., IBM in the 1990s);
and bankruptcies and catastrophic collapses in
organizational finance (e.g., AIG, Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae, Northern Rock).
There are several potential consequences of
organization-level failures. Although employees
will differ in their emotional and behavioral responses (Bies & Tripp, 1996; Mishra, 1996), the

distress and uncertainty can be profoundly unsettling for those who have invested their effort,
reputation, and career ambitions in the service
of a now discredited organization. The loss of
trust and resulting distrust may manifest in employees’ reduced willingness to display the kind
of trust-informed behaviors that contribute to
effective operational functioning (Dirks & Ferrin,
2001), as well as withdrawal (Robinson, 1996)
and even obstructionism and acts of retaliation
(Bies & Tripp, 1996). The failure can lead to a
breakdown or renegotiation of internal and external relationships.
Research suggests that broken trust can be
repaired (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan, 2002; Mishra, 1996), with much depending on the violator’s response (Korsgaard, Brodt,
& Whitener, 2002; Schweitzer, Hershey, & Bradley, 2006). However, most organizations respond
poorly to trust failures (Schwartz & Gibb, 1999),
typically acting too late, with inappropriate
equivocation, and with less regard for internal
relations than for external relations. Given the
prevalence of trust failures in organizations
(Mishra, 1996; Robinson, 1996) and the seriousness of their consequences, knowing how to repair trust has become a “critical management
competency” (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Yet, to
date, little attention has been paid to repairing
trust at the organizational level.
Drawing on prior research and theory on trust,
systems and multilevel theory, crisis management, and strategic organizational change, we
propose a framework for analyzing and repairing

employees’ perceptions of their organization’s
trustworthiness. In developing our framework, we
first define organizational trustworthiness and
organization-level failures and briefly review
prior research on trust repair. We then conceptualize organizations as multilevel systems and
identify the components that contribute to perceptions of the organization’s trustworthiness,
as well as to failures. With these foundations in
place, we identify the underlying mechanisms
and principles for organizational trust repair
and illustrate how these operate through each
system component and each stage of our trust
repair process. In the final section we describe
the implications for research and practice.

concept (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998), integrating microlevel psychological processes and group dynamics with macrolevel organizational and institutional forms. Our level
of analysis is primarily at the individual level—
that is, employees’ perceived organizational
trustworthiness. However, following Morgeson
and Hofmann (1999), we also see organizational
trustworthiness as a collective construct—a
sensemaking heuristic originating at the level
of individuals’ perceptions but that, in the aggregate of collective impressions, can operate
as a shared reputation in the organization.

Organizational Failure
DEFINITIONS
Organizational Trustworthiness
In this paper we focus on employees’ perceptions of the trustworthiness of their organization
and the processes required for repairing these
perceptions once they are damaged by an organization-level failure. Perceived organizational
trustworthiness relates to the set of “confident
positive expectations” employees have about
the intentions and likely future actions of their
employer (Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998).
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) identified
three dimensions of trustworthiness, which we
adapt to the organizational level: (1) ability (the
organization’s collective competencies and characteristics that enable it to function reliably and
effectively to meet its goals and responsibilities),
(2) benevolence (organizational action indicating
genuine care and concern for the well-being of
stakeholders), and (3) integrity (organizational action that consistently adheres to moral principles
and a code of conduct acceptable to employees,
such as honesty and fairness).
Employees use these characteristics to evaluate a variety of targets, including immediate
working relationships (Butler, 1991), senior management (Mayer & Davis, 1999), internal groups,
and the organization itself (Robinson, 1996). In
making judgments about the overall trustworthiness of their organization, employees consider these multiple actors, as well as sources of
evidence drawn from multiple organizational
components and levels (Galford & Drapeau,
2003; Nooteboom, 2002). Hence, trust is a “meso”

We draw on prior research on failures, crises,
and betrayal in organizations to define organization-level failure as a single major incident, or
cumulative series of incidents, resulting from
the action (or inaction) of organizational agents
that threatens the legitimacy of the organization
and has the potential to harm the well-being of
one or more of the organization’s stakeholders.
We now describe each condition.
First, to manifest at the organizational level,
the failure must be of sufficient magnitude to
threaten the legitimacy of the organization itself
(Anheier, 1999). The crisis of legitimacy may
stem from the failure’s calling into question (1)
the organization’s capacity to fulfill its fundamental mission or one of its essential responsibilities (e.g., safe transport for P&O Ferries, accurate journalism for the New York Times)
and/or (2) the organization’s adherence to commonly endorsed ethical standards (e.g., to avoid
lethal, exploitative, or dishonest work practices).
In trust terms, the organization has failed in its
responsibility to meet reasonable standards of
ability, benevolence, and/or integrity in its conduct toward its stakeholders.
Second, the perceived potential or actual
harm arising from the failure may not necessarily be borne by the employees themselves but,
rather, by other stakeholders, such as customers, shareholders, or the wider community. Nevertheless, this can affect employees profoundly
by undermining their faith in their employer,
with which much of their social identity is inextricably bound (cf. Tajfel & Turner, 1985), as well
as by inducing a sense of shame and guilt by

<-----Page 2----->2009

Gillespie and Dietz

association1 and by damaging job security.
Harm to another stakeholder also indicates that
the organization is capable of similar conduct
toward its own employees.
Third, the failure is understood as having occurred as a consequence of actions, or negligent
inaction, from organizational agents who have
acted as authorized, instructed, or otherwise facilitated by the organization. The locus of control for the failure is internal to the organization,
even though the context for the failure may involve external influences.
To qualify as an organizational failure, each
condition is necessary but not sufficient, and
together they distinguish organization-level
failures from more minor transgressions. Even
when each condition is met, failures will vary in
magnitude, depending on the extent of each
condition: the harm caused may be hypothetical
(e.g., successful product recalls) or very real
(e.g., loss of life, jobs, or invested money), the
threat to legitimacy may be modest and shortlived (e.g., the New York Times) or catastrophic
(e.g., WorldCom), and the organization may
have had total or partial control over the
(in)action leading to the failure.
For parsimony, our point of entry is postattribution—that is, once the failure has occurred
and has damaged employees’ perceptions of organizational trustworthiness. While individual
employees may differ in their attributions and
perceptions, our assumption is that organization-level failures are of a magnitude that damages most employees’ perceptions.
TRUST REPAIR: PRIOR THEORY AND
RESEARCH
Empirical studies on trust repair in organizational settings have examined the conditions
under which trust is broken and which remedial

1
Schwartz and Gibb note that “when a company finds
itself pilloried by the press and/or its customers, the consequences are real for both the organization and the individuals involved” (1999: xiii). They cite incidents of Shell employees after the Ken Saro-Wiwa incident wrestling with
“the shock of finding themselves blamed for the tragedies—
even their children were being harassed at school” (1999: 28),
workers at Union Carbide “crying at their desks . . . in the
weeks after Bhopal” (1999: 170), and the CEO of Nike conceding that part of the motivation for their code of conduct was
to make workers at Nike “feel better about ourselves”
(1999: 54).

129

activities are most effective in repairing the relationship. Recommended actions include
Lewicki and Bunker’s (1996: 131–133) four-stage
process: (1) acknowledge that a violation has
occurred, (2) determine the causes of the violation and admit culpability, (3) admit the act was
destructive, and (4) accept responsibility for the
consequences. The transgressor should then engage in action designed to undo the violation
and rebuild the trust. Tomlinson, Dineen, and
Lewicki (2004) similarly have urged violators to
always apologize and admit culpability where
relevant. However, this contradicts Kim, Ferrin,
Cooper, and Dirks’ (2004) finding that apologies
are more effective for competence-based violations, whereas denials are more effective for
violations of integrity.
Fewer studies have focused on substantive (as
opposed to verbal) actions. Bottom et al. (2002)
have reported that offers of penance elicit cooperation more effectively than verbal responses
alone, while Dirks, Kim, Cooper, and Ferrin
(2005) have reported that punishment and regulation of the transgressor both effectively increase trust following a violation. Nakayachi
and Watabe (2005) found that voluntarily introducing monitoring systems and sanctions
helped restore perceived organizational trustworthiness from the perspective of consumers.
Although this literature provides valuable insights for interpersonal trust repair, its focus
and assumptions do not translate well to the
organizational level. First, studies focus primarily on interpersonal trust between a single
violator and victim, yet, as we have argued,
perceived organizational trustworthiness is influenced by multiple sources of evidence and
actors operating at multiple organizational levels. Second, experimental studies limit the
choice of remedial options, often to a unitary
verbal response (e.g., denial or apology). Following an organization-level failure, a single response will rarely be sufficient. Trust repair will
instead involve a protracted process requiring
several complementary responses at multiple
levels. Third, experimental studies minimize input from beyond the immediate interaction. Typically, the victim has limited information about
the guilty party; the act and its aftermath are
private to the dyad, and the consequences of the
failure and decisions regarding reconciliation
are minimal and transient. These conditions do
not apply to organization-level failures; many

<-----Page 3----->130

employees have extensive history and inside
information about the organization’s conduct,
and there are very real consequences for them
and the organization. The failure is often in full
public view, and external groups or forces may
influence the trust repair process. Finally, in
dyadic situations the transgressor knows what
caused the violation and what his or her role
was in making it happen. In contrast, blame and
responsibility typically are more diffuse in organizational failures, with multiple contributors. In summary, there is little theory or research to guide trust repair at the organizational
level. We propose that a systemic, multilevel,
and multiactor framework is needed to guide
trust repair at this level.
A SYSTEMIC FRAMEWORK FOR
ORGANIZATION-LEVEL TRUST REPAIR
To understand organization-level trust repair,
we first need to identify what factors both influence employees’ assessment of the organization’s (un)trustworthiness and contribute to organizational failures. To date, no coherent
theory or model exists to guide such an understanding. Our framework is informed by systems (Burke, 2002; Katz & Kahn, 1978) and multilevel theories (Klein & Kozlowski, 2000;
Morgeson & Hofmann, 1999).
Systems theory depicts organizations as converting external inputs (e.g., resources, investment, new recruits) into outputs (e.g., products
and services) via a “throughput” stage, which
comprises the organization’s entire operations
and activities. From this perspective, an organization-level failure results from faults in the
throughput, which damage the quality and supply of outputs and/or relations with input suppliers (e.g., investors, customers, future employees) and, hence, the organization’s reputation
for trustworthiness (Burke, 2002: 47).
The throughput stage comprises multiple organizational system components. We focus on
six—four internal and two external (see Figure
1). Drawing from models of strategic change
(Burke & Litwin, 1992; Nadler & Tushman, 1997),
prominent internal components include leadership and management practice; culture and climate; strategy; and structures, policies, and processes. In turn, these components are influenced
by variables from the organization’s environment. Two external factors pertinent to under-

January

standing organizational trustworthiness are external governance and the organization’s public
reputation.
Both systems and multilevel theory highlight
that the organization’s various components operate at multiple levels and that activities
within one component and level can influence
and be influenced by those occurring in other
components and levels (Rivkin & Siggelkow,
2003). Micro phenomena, such as perceptions of
organizational trustworthiness, are influenced
by macrolevel factors, while macro phenomena,
such as an organizational failure, often emerge
through the interactions of lower-level elements
(Klein & Kozlowski, 2000). Pertinent to our framework is the view that an organization’s reputation for trustworthiness forms as a result of interactions among agents and groups in a
multilevel network (e.g., senior leadership, line
management, employees in each work unit):
“Only through interaction does a construct acquire meaning and structure” (Morgeson & Hofmann, 1999: 256). Through the influence of the
interconnected organizational components, certain interactions are facilitated and reinforced
and, if repeated regularly over time, form institutionalized patterns of behavior and thinking
(“event cycles”; cf. Morgeson & Hofmann, 1999).
These provide the cumulative evidence for employees to judge their employer’s trustworthiness.
Thus, the organization does not display trustworthiness—its members do, through interactions
and event cycles sanctioned by, and embedded in,
the organization’s system components.
Organizational Trustworthiness: Systemic
Contributors
Each subsection that follows supports our first
foundational premise that each of the six system
components identified in Figure 1 sends cues
about the organization’s ability, benevolence,
and integrity, and these cues influence, either
positively or negatively, employees’ perceived
organizational trustworthiness.
Leadership and management practice. An organization’s senior leaders and levels of management symbolize and shape the conduct of
the organization (Smircich & Morgan, 1982). By
virtue of their authority and accountability, senior leaders’ actions directly inform employees’
impressions of the organization’s trustworthiness (Kouzes & Posner, 2002). At the pivotal work

FIGURE 1
Organizational System Components and Their Effects on Employees’ Perceptions of
Organizational Trustworthiness and Organization-Level Failures

unit level, an employee’s relationship with his
or her line manager often acts as a lens through
which the employee learns about and interprets
the rest of the organization. If employees distrust their immediate manager, this taints their
perception of the broader organization’s trustworthiness (Kouzes & Posner, 2002). Through
their own behavior as role models (Schein, 1990)
and their influence and discretion over other
system components (e.g., rewards, appraisals,
cultural values), managers at all levels send
signals about what is expected of employees,
including whether untrustworthy or even unethical behaviors might be tolerated and even tacitly encouraged (see Dickson, Smith, Grojean, &
Ehrhart, 2001).
Culture and climate. Organizational culture,
subcultures, and work unit climates influence
the development of commonly held mental schemata and employees’ shared interpretations of
organizational actions and events (Schein, 1990;
Victor & Cullen, 1988). Employees’ perceptions of
their organization’s trustworthiness can be derived from shared cultural beliefs; values and
norms (Nooteboom, 2002); forms of cultural con-

trol (Das & Teng, 1998; Perrone, Zaheer, &
McEvily, 2003); and artifacts, such as work stories, legends, and value statements. Case studies attest to organizational and work unit norms
exerting strong pressure on employees to act in
untrustworthy ways, and even justifying questionable behavior (Dickson et al., 2001; Treviño,
1986).
Strategy. Organizational strategy, including
financial, operational, and human resource
strategies, determine work unit goals, resources,
budgets, policies, and procedures, which, in
turn, send signals to employees about expected
behavior and the organization’s real values and
priorities (Burke & Litwin, 1992). The coherence
and effectiveness of the strategy can directly
affect interpretations of organizational competence. The strategy also signals the organization’s intention to act with integrity and benevolence toward its stakeholders. Several prominent failures have involved questionable
strategies amounting to incompetent “overreach” (e.g., see Probst & Raisch, 2005: 92–94) or
disregard for certain stakeholders (e.g., cost cut-

<-----Page 5----->132

ting to the detriment of health and safety), each
of which undermines trustworthiness.
Structures, policies, and processes. By “structures,” we mean reporting lines, checks and balances, distribution of responsibility and authority, and work formalization. By “policies and
processes,” we mean the rules, guidelines, and
procedures governing decision making, communication, employee conduct, and human resource management (HRM). Together, these set
parameters around acceptable behaviors and
can instill and even control members’ (un)trustworthiness by assigning roles and expectations
for incumbents and constraining discretionary
actions (Perrone et al., 2003; Shapiro, 1987). Conversely, absent, unclear, or unused arrangements can facilitate or fail to prevent incompetent and dishonest behavior. In this manner
structures, policies, and processes can powerfully
influence organizational trustworthiness. The fairness and consistency of structures, policies, and
processes, both in design and implementation,
are indicative of benevolence and integrity, while
coherence and effectiveness imply ability. HRM
policies in particular have been shown to influence employees’ perceptions of organizational
trustworthiness (see Mayer & Davis, 1999).
External governance. In addition to these internal components, expectations of what constitutes trustworthy behavior are embedded within
external governing structures and rules that
constrain the organization’s conduct. Forms of
institutional-based trust (Zucker, 1986) include
legislation and regulatory mechanisms from
government, professional and trade associations, industry networks (Ring & Van de Ven,
1992), and, increasingly, consumer and environmental bodies. To the extent that these “impersonal structures” are trusted, they can provide a
basis for trust in the organization by proxy (McKnight et al., 1998: 474). However, as Arthur
Andersen’s collusion with the Enron fraud highlights, the institutional environment may lack
adequate constraining mechanisms or may contain opportunities and even incentives for parties to engage in untrustworthy activities.
Public reputation. Finally, employees also
take cues from how their organization’s reputation for ability, benevolence, and integrity is
perceived by external stakeholders (e.g., by customers, industry representatives, the media).
Cues come from judgments about the organization’s products and services, the familiarity of its

January

brand, and its standing among industry and
stakeholder networks (Klein, 1997). Employees
take pride in, and are reassured by, a stable
external reputation for trustworthiness (Shaw &
Post, 1993), whereas public dismay over poorquality goods or services or inappropriate
treatment of stakeholders will undermine employees’ perceptions of their organization’s
trustworthiness.
We anticipate that the salience of each component for employees’ perceptions will vary
across organizations and sectors, as well as
among employees. Our essential point here is
that each component communicates cues that,
in the aggregate, form the collective construct of
perceived organizational trustworthiness. This
leads to our first foundational premise.
Premise 1: Employees’ perceptions of
organizational trustworthiness are influenced by multiple cues from the organization’s six system components:
leadership and management practice;
culture and climate; strategy; structures, policies, and processes; external
governance; and public reputation.

Organizational Failures: Systemic Contributors
As illustrated in the previous subsections,
each component can engender organizational
trustworthiness but can also facilitate untrustworthy behavior, which increases the likelihood
of an organizational failure. Our second foundational premise is that multiple organizational
components and agents contribute to the dysfunctional interactions and event cycles that result in organizational failures: “Unethical or illegal actions cannot take place without
opportunity” (O’Connor, Priem, Coombs, & Gilley, 2006: 486)—nor, we suggest, can incompetence or avoidable accidents. Even when an individual’s lone actions seem to have caused the
failure (e.g., Nick Leeson’s risky trading “singlehandedly” destroying Barings Bank), these actions are typically facilitated by a deviant or
inadequate culture, strategy, or management
and/or by ineffective constraining structures,
policies, and processes (all of the above in Leeson’s case). We do not anticipate that every component will be implicated; rather, failures of a
magnitude that threaten the organization’s legitimacy will have multiple contributory causes.

<-----Page 6----->2009

Gillespie and Dietz

This premise is supported by systems and multilevel theory and by research and case studies
on organizational failures and crises (see Haunschild & Sullivan, 2002; O’Connor et al., 2006;
Pearson & Clair, 1998; Rivkin & Siggelkow,
2003).2
We distinguish the role of internal and external system components in organizational failures. While every organization is constrained by
external governance structures (or enabled by
their absence or incentives therein), organizational members nevertheless retain considerable discretion over how they respond (Katz &
Kahn, 1978), including whether they act in a
trustworthy manner or not. As the equifinality
principle (Gresov & Drazin, 1997) states, alternative strategies exist for how organizations respond to the same circumstances and, hence,
how they choose to coordinate the system components. Not all firms in a sector “fail,” although
all face the same difficult external factors. Thus,
only the internal components contribute directly
to organization-level failures (see Figure 1).
Premise 2: Organization-level failures
are systemic in nature, yet only the
multiple internal organizational components contribute directly to organization-level failures.
PRINCIPLES FOR REPAIRING
ORGANIZATIONAL TRUSTWORTHINESS
The two preceding premises are foundational
since they provide an understanding of the systemic construction of perceived organizational
2

The investigation into the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster (CAIB, 2003) identified as contributory causes NASA’s
culture (which diminished safety), management practices
(which prevented communication), an inappropriate chain of
command, resource constraints, fluctuating priorities, and
scheduling pressures. BP’s 2005 Texas City refinery fire was
initially attributed to mistakes by individual employees, but
the official investigation revealed complex interconnected
causes, including management lapses; unclear responsibilities and accountabilities; lack of training; inadequate
maintenance; poor communication, reward, and performance management processes; and a “fragmented culture”
characterized by “resistance to change” and “distrust.” The
report into the Enron collapse concluded that it was “the
result of failures at many levels and by many people,” identifying among the key contributors financial incentives, conflicts of interest, inadequate controls, and a “culture [that]
appears to have encouraged ’pushing the limits”’ (Powers,
Troubh, & Winokur, 2002: 27–28).

trustworthiness and the systemic factors contributing to organizational failures that need
consideration in designing trust repair interventions. We now describe two underlying mechanisms for trust repair and the principle of congruence, and we illustrate how these operate
through each system component. Because our
entry point is postattribution, we focus on trust
repair strategies that deal with the aftermath of
the failure, rather than attempts to reposition
perceptions of the failure itself.
Underlying Mechanisms for Trust Repair
People undergo a cognitive reappraisal of the
relationship following a trust failure, with a tendency to privilege negative evidence over positive evidence (Kim et al., 2004; Slovic, 1993). During this fragile period, people are strongly
motivated to avoid risk, are “hypervigilant” to
suggestions of future untrustworthy behavior,
and are susceptible to “paranoid cognitions”
and “sinister attribution error” (Kramer, 1996).
These cognitive biases can lead to overconstrued and negative inferences about the motives, character, and competence of the organization and its management, impeding accurate
sensemaking and learning about the failure
(Haunschild & Sullivan, 2002) and hampering
trust repair efforts. Thus, the primary objectives
of any trust repair process are to overcome these
salient negative expectations and to restore
confident positive expectations about the violator’s future trustworthiness (Kim et al., 2004). We
draw on the distinction between trust and distrust (see Lewicki et al., 1998) to identify two
complementary mechanisms that underlie organization-level trust repair: distrust regulation
and trustworthiness demonstration.
Distrust regulation. This mechanism attempts
to overcome employees’ distrust—the confident
negative expectations (cf. Lewicki et al., 1998)
and “expectation of injurious action” (Luhmann,
1979: 72)—arising from the failure. It does so
through actions designed to avoid and prevent
future trust transgressions, by dealing with the
faults that led to the failure— both direct and
contributory. If these faults remain in place, the
likelihood of a recurrence is high, and this potentiality will further undermine employees’
confidence. Trust repair is much more difficult
after repeated violations than after an initial
failure (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).

<-----Page 7----->134

Academy of Management Review

Distrust regulation interventions are designed
to modify the organization’s dysfunctional components and errant interactions and event cycles
that contributed to the failure, replacing them with
a new “admissible range” of behaviors. This
mechanism involves implementing sufficient regulatory controls to prevent or constrain organizational members and groups from acting in ways
that could lead to future violations, including the
removal of incentives that may encourage untrustworthy behavior. This reflects Nooteboom’s observation (2002) that organizational trustworthiness is
founded largely on an organization’s ability to foster and control its members’ trustworthiness. The
aim is to reduce and eventually dissipate fears
and skepticism about the organization’s intention
and ability to avoid future transgressions.
These “legalistic remedies” (Sitkin & Roth,
1993) include regulations, rules, contracts, monitoring processes, and controls. Embedded in
these approaches are deterrents in the form of
punishments and sanctions imposed on those
who engage in untrustworthy behavior (e.g., being fined, fired, demoted, or ostracized, or losing
accreditation, privileges, membership, status, or
social capital). The presence of such punishment sends clear signals that the behavior is
unacceptable and offenders will “pay a price.”
Research suggests that these regulatory systems can significantly enhance and repair perceived organizational trustworthiness (Sitkin &
Roth, 1993; Slovic, 1993), particularly when introduced voluntarily rather than imposed externally (Dirks et al., 2005; Nakayachi & Watabe,
2005). When regulations are imposed (e.g., by the
government), compliance may be attributed to
the desire to avoid sanctions, raising concerns
that the organization may get around or weaken
the constraints. In contrast, a voluntary effort
will be seen as diagnostic of the organization
itself (Heider, 1958), implying that it has learned
a lesson and is intrinsically committed to, and
confident in its ability to, act differently (Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005).
Proposition 1a: After an organizational failure, the voluntary implementation of interventions that constrain
untrustworthy behavior by organizational agents increases employees’
perceptions of the organization’s
trustworthiness.

January

We anticipate that employees will accept the
legitimate need for the organization to impose
regulations on itself and its agents in order to
prevent future failures. The magnitude of the
organization-level failure provides a clear and
powerful motivation.
Trustworthiness demonstration. Overcoming
negative expectations and distrust is essential to
trust repair, but it does not go far enough. As
Lewicki et al. argue, “Removal of foundations of
distrust . . . does not necessarily facilitate the
emergence of trust” (1998: 452). It is also necessary
to restore positive expectations (Kim et al., 2004)
and a sense of good faith and fair dealing (Rousseau et al., 1998). This second mechanism, trustworthiness demonstration, is about the positive
promotion of renewed trustworthiness through behaviors and verbal responses that actively demonstrate ability, benevolence, and integrity. It is
focused on sending repeated, clear, and consistent signals that employees can anticipate beneficial conduct and desirable actions from the organization, resulting in a sense of hope, faith, and
assurance (Lewicki et al., 1998: 444 – 445).
This mechanism includes expressions of regret, acknowledgment of responsibility, apologies, and offers of reparations, as well as general displays of competence, benevolence, and
integrity in the organization’s initial and ongoing response to the failure (e.g., meeting new
commitments). Hence, this mechanism is distinct from distrust regulation, since it focuses
on symbolic and actual displays of positive
trustworthiness, rather than on regulating
negative behavior related to the cause of the
failure (e.g., apologizing and offering reparations demonstrates benevolence and fairness
but does not directly prevent a future transgression). This mechanism is complementary
to distrust regulation, since repeated and/or
enduring displays of such positive signals
over time help restore employees’ confidence
in the organization.
Proposition 1b: After an organizational failure, the implementation of interventions that demonstrate and symbolize the organization’s ability,
benevolence, and integrity increases
employees’ perceptions of the organization’s trustworthiness.
Table 1 provides illustrative examples of how

The Principle of Congruence
Because multiple organizational components
contribute to both perceived organizational
trustworthiness (Premise 1) and organization-

● Revise strategy to be consistent with espoused
trust-based values
● Reform strategy to show an enduring commitment to
treat stakeholders benevolently and with integrity
● Promote ethical conduct and corporate social
responsibility
● Revise policies and procedures to ensure employees
perceive them to be fair, effective, and just (e.g.,
transparent and equitable appraisal systems,
dispute resolution and whistleblowing procedures).
● Use recruitment, selection, induction, and training
procedures, emphasizing personal integrity and organizational values symbolizing trustworthiness

● Voluntarily engage with external regulatory bodies
● Seek licensing/accreditation (e.g., SA8000 on ethical
conduct)
● Campaign government for sector-wide regulations
● Use trust-enhancing communications, marketing,
and branding
● Offer public apologies and reparations (where
appropriate)
● Voluntarily communicate to the public the diagnosis
and evaluations

level failure (Premise 2), trust repair requires
that the “signals” emanating from the different
components reinforce, not undermine, renewed
trustworthiness. Given employees’ likely hypervigilance and paranoia, any further transgressions, lapses, or inconsistencies, however minor, can significantly impair the fragile trust
repair effort. Isolated interventions to only one

<-----Page 9----->136

component are unlikely, therefore, to provide
sufficient evidence to convince employees that a
predictable and sustainable difference in organizational trustworthiness has been realized.
Rather, a coordinated set of interventions across
the multiple components contributing to the failure will be required. In line with systems thinking, we propose that congruence is key to effective trust repair.
We define congruence as the degree to which
signals emanating from each component are
consistent together in demonstrating cues of renewed organizational trustworthiness and in
preventing future untrustworthy behavior. For
example, interventions emphasizing ethical
codes of conduct during socialization and training activities are unlikely to change behavior if
workplace norms encourage questionable behavior and performance management practices
focus solely on target achievement at any cost.
Since a lack of trustworthiness in just one component may undermine employees’ confidence,
we do not see interventions across different
components as playing a strictly additive or incremental role. Rather, a level of congruence
must be achieved before an appreciable increase in organizational trustworthiness can be
realized. This echoes the idea of alignment
among interdependent organizational elements
(see Siggelkow, 2002) and of “internal fit” from
strategic HRM (Wood, 1999). Congruence is
achieved when the organizational components
are realigned into an internally coherent configuration that consistently signals reasonable
standards of ability, benevolence, and integrity,
with no contradictory signals or competing imperatives elsewhere in the system. Just as behavioral integrity—the alignment of leaders’
words and actions (Simons, 2002)— has been
shown to be central to interpersonal trust and
credibility (Kouzes & Posner, 2002), congruence
is pivotal to effective organizational trust repair.
Proposition 2: The effectiveness of
trust repair interventions is moderated
by the extent to which they achieve
congruence across organizational
components in (a) constraining
untrustworthy behavior by organizational agents and (b) demonstrating
the organization’s trustworthiness.
The greater the congruence, the stronger the impact of the interventions on

January

employees’ perceptions of the organization’s trustworthiness will be.
Implicit in our use of the two underlying
mechanisms is the need to regulate distrust and
demonstrate trustworthiness across each of the
three dimensions of ability, benevolence, and
integrity. This has merit since organizational
failures often involve faults in multiple dimensions of trustworthiness. For example, investigations into the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry sinking
and into the NASA Space Shuttle disasters revealed that these resulted not only from a lack of
competence but also from a disregard for safety.
Employees’ interpretations of failures may also
differ from one another and may not settle on a
single dimension; evidence of failure across all
three dimensions may be evoked, albeit to varying degrees. Controlled laboratory studies that
have deliberately manipulated only one type of
violation (e.g., ability or integrity) have shown
that perceived trustworthiness in the other dimension also declines (Dirks et al., 2005; Kim et
al., 2004). Furthermore, employees’ hypervigilance in response to a failure is likely to apply
across all three dimensions.
While violations in one dimension may
contaminate perceptions in another, it does not
follow that the repair of one dimension necessarily will enhance perceptions of other dimensions. This view is supported by research indicating that, after a trust violation, people pay
more attention and attribute more significance
to negative than positive evidence (Slovic, 1993)
and that individuals tend to weigh positive information more heavily than negative information when evaluating ability but tend to weigh
negative information more heavily than positive
information when evaluating integrity (Kim et
al., 2004: 107–108; Snyder & Stukas, 1999). Consequently, it is unlikely that positive new evidence
in one dimension will transfer to other dimensions. As we elaborate later (see Propositions 7a
and 7b), this suggests that different types of
interventions are required to repair different aspects of trustworthiness. Hence, interventions
addressing only one dimension will be inadequate to restore a robust reputation of trustworthiness.
Proposition 3: The effectiveness of
trust repair interventions is moderated
by the extent to which they address
each of the three dimensions of trust-

worthiness, rather than just one dimension. The more multiple dimensions are addressed, the stronger the
impact of the interventions on employees’ perceptions of the organization’s
trustworthiness will be.
A PROCESS FOR REPAIRING
ORGANIZATIONAL TRUSTWORTHINESS
In this section we argue that robust, organization-level trust repair involves a four-stage process (see Figure 2). The stages are informed by
the trust and strategic change management literature (Burke & Litwin, 1992; Lewicki & Bunker,
1996) and systems and multilevel theory, as well
as analysis of case study accounts of responses
to failures. We describe the aims, rationale, and
propositions for each stage and show how distrust regulation and trustworthiness demonstration underlie trust repair actions.
Stage 1: Immediate Responses
A critical and urgent step for organizational
representatives is an initial communication to
employees and affected stakeholders about the
failure. As the organization’s first attempt to re-

137

establish its reputation, this response needs to
be well considered, timely, and credible.
Research suggests that the choice and sequence of verbal responses impact trust repair.
From the range of available options, we do not
see denying the failure has happened or excusing the organization as credible responses. In
the context of organizational failures, responsibility lies by definition at least in part with the
organization, and duplicitous impression management has been found to be ineffective (Bottom et al., 2002) and unsustainable in the face of
evidence of guilt (Kim et al., 2004). Rather, an
overarching standard for our trust repair process is accuracy and transparency (Korsgaard et
al., 2002).
We propose that senior leaders’ first communication requires an acknowledgment that the
failure has occurred and an expression of sincere regret for the consequences. Research suggests these verbal responses aid forgiveness
and trust repair (Bottom et al., 2002). Committing
to a full investigation into the causes of the
failure and to measures to prevent future reoccurrences is also essential. Together, these responses reassure employees, and they signal
the organization’s concern for stakeholders (benevolence), commitment to understanding how

FIGURE 2
Propositions for the Principles and Four-Stage Process of Organization-Level Trust Repair

<-----Page 11----->138

Academy of Management Review

the violation occurred (integrity), and ability to
avoid a reoccurrence. Not offering any communication conveys a lack of concern and integrity,
as well as incompetence. Such “reticence” has
proven ineffective for trust repair (Ferrin, Kim,
Cooper, & Dirks, 2007). For example, Exxon’s “no
comment” stance immediately after the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill alienated employees,
communities, and the media, damaging its credibility further.
Subsequent communications will be required
to convey the causes of the failure, the organization’s full remedial response, and, where appropriate, an apology and offer of reparations.
However, rarely are the precise direct and indirect causes immediately known (see Premise 2),
and a full diagnosis is likely to take considerable time. Therefore, we suggest that such communications are not made until the diagnostic
investigation is complete (see Stage 3), to avoid
premature and possibly inaccurate conclusions,
inappropriate blame, and ineffective responses
that may undermine trustworthiness further and
leave the organization more vulnerable to legal
action and public condemnation.
Proposition 4a: A timely initial communication acknowledging the occurrence of the failure, expressing
sincere regret for the (potential) consequences, and announcing a full
investigation and commitment to prevent future reoccurrences will positively impact employees’ perceptions
of the organization’s trustworthiness.
With the announcement of the diagnostic investigation, immediate interventions are required to rectify any causes of the failure that
can be established confidently prior to the diagnosis and that continue to pose a risk to stakeholders (distrust regulation). Inaction in the face
of this awareness will be highly damaging to
the organization’s reputation, signaling incompetence, questionable integrity, and even malevolent intent, whereas swift interventions will
communicate the organization’s commitment to
restoring its reputation (trustworthiness demonstration). Examples include suspending those
people directly implicated, closing down or limiting operations, withdrawing goods, and warning stakeholders of the problem. Given the short
time frame, we expect these efforts to focus on
two internal components: (1) leadership and

January

management and (2) structures, policies, and
processes. In contrast to the other components,
these are more amenable to rapid changes and
interventions (see Burke & Litwin, 1992).
Proposition 4b: Timely, initial interventions that prevent or constrain a
reoccurrence of the failure will positively impact employees’ perceived organizational trustworthiness.

Stage 2: Diagnosis
The aim of the diagnosis is to systematically
identify what contributed to the failure and
what needs to change so as to prevent similar
incidents in the future, as well as any other
actions required to restore trust. We propose
that the effectiveness of the diagnosis for trust
repair will be influenced by three qualities: accuracy, transparency, and timeliness.
Accuracy and transparency. The perceived
adequacy of explanations is key to overcoming
negative reactions. Any diagnostic account
must provide “sufficient substance . . . to be believable” and match in its scope the magnitude
of the offence (Bottom et al., 2002: 499). In
line with Premise 2 and our principle of congruence, an accurate diagnosis requires systemwide scope, extending beyond those agents and
components that appear most directly associated with the failure to explore the role played
by each component in enabling and facilitating,
or failing to prevent, the failure. A partial diagnosis may result in ineffective attempts to repair
trust. Accessing the accounts and tacit knowledge of a representative cross-section of organizational members about dysfunctional organizational components will help to reduce bias and
enhance diagnostic accuracy.
Diagnostic processes can be manipulated,
however. Organizations may try to keep their
involvement in questionable practices covert, to
recast the failure and damage in a more benign
light (Greenberg, 1990), or to isolate blame to a
contained source (“scapegoats”). However, such
“cheap talk” is rarely sufficient (Bottom et al.,
2002), and dishonest tactics can backfire (Kim et
al., 2004; Schlenker, Pontari, & Christopher,
2001). Apart from the lack of integrity in presenting a dishonest or inaccurate diagnosis, doing
so is risky because some employees will have
insider status, networks, and/or knowledge giv-

<-----Page 12----->2009

Gillespie and Dietz

ing them substantial evidence on which to judge
the failure’s real causes. They may expose inaccuracies, cover-ups, and whether the potential
for repeat failures remains to colleagues and
wider networks (whistleblowing; see Miceli &
Near, 1985), engendering cynicism and hampering the repair effort.
The effects of making the diagnostic findings
transparent are currently underexplored. Full
disclosure enables the accuracy of the diagnosis to be evaluated, which, if accepted, provides
a shared understanding of the causes of the
failure and recommended reforms, enabling all
organizational members to consciously avoid
and constrain the conditions contributing to the
failure. Without such information employees
will not know the rationale for the interventions
and will likely be uncommitted to them. Hence,
a transparent diagnosis facilitates distrust regulation. The effects of transparency on trustworthiness demonstration, however, are more complex. Paradoxically, full and frank disclosure of
the organization’s faults may damage employees’ trustworthiness perceptions further in the
short term, especially if failures of benevolence
or integrity are implicated (cf. Snyder & Stukas,
1999). Yet not disclosing the findings and evidence supporting them is likely to have an even
more deleterious effect, suggesting the organization has something to hide and has not
learned from the failure. Adverse reactions are
likely, given employees’ hypervigilant state.
Moreover, we anticipate that when disclosure is
enacted voluntarily for the purpose of organizational learning (Haunschild & Sullivan, 2002)
and to prevent future violations, the positive
signals this sends about the organization’s integrity and benevolence (Nakayachi & Watabe,
2005) will counteract any potentially damaging
effects from the content of the findings.
Proposition 5a: The impact of the diagnosis on employees’ perceptions of the
organization’s trustworthiness is moderated by its accuracy and transparency. When both accuracy and transparency are high, the diagnosis will
positively affect perceived organizational trustworthiness; when either is
low, there will be a negative effect.
Timeliness. As argued in Stage 1, a rushed
diagnosis does little to enhance, but rather may
damage, employees’ perceptions of trustworthi-

139

ness. However, as stakeholders’ patience
quickly wears thin, the diagnosis needs to be
conducted and reported as soon as is practical.
A timely diagnosis is also important for ensuring accuracy, since information, people, and
other sources of “evidence” become less reliable
and accessible over time.
A sense of urgency also demonstrates the organization’s concern to prevent future transgressions and its ability to respond effectively. A
slow response signals incompetence and a lack
of benevolence for those affected, and it enables
system faults to fester unnecessarily, increasing
the risk of future trust transgressions. Furthermore, in the absence of an explanatory diagnosis, employees will rely on subjective interpretations and rumors to make sense of the failure
(Kramer, 1996).
Given research suggesting that third parties
tend to amplify and accentuate negative over
positive information (Burt & Knez, 1996), countering the inevitable rumor machine with a timely
diagnosis is vital for trust repair. Interim diagnostic reports summarizing verifiable preliminary findings can help in this regard. In summary, we argue for a curvilinear effect for
timeliness on employees’ perceived organizational trustworthiness.
Proposition 5b: The timeliness of the
diagnosis has a curvilinear relationship with employees’ perceived organizational trustworthiness. A premature or too slow diagnosis will be
associated with low trustworthiness,
whereas a timely diagnosis will be
associated with high trustworthiness.

Stage 3: Reforming Interventions
The diagnostic information provides the foundation to devise and plan reforming interventions, including which organizational components to target. Examples of trust-enhancing
interventions for each component and underlying mechanism are given in Table 1. In this
section we first discuss the communications required postdiagnosis. We then consider how the
relative effectiveness of the two trust repair
mechanisms (distrust regulation and trustworthiness demonstration) depend on the dimension of trustworthiness targeted.

<-----Page 13----->140

Academy of Management Review

Communication postdiagnosis. Where the diagnosis reveals organizational responsibility,
apologies (i.e., acknowledgement of responsibility and guilt) and offers of reparations to affected stakeholders (i.e., forms of penance) can
substantially aid trust repair (Bottom et al., 2002;
Kim et al., 2004; Tomlinson et al., 2004). However,
organizations often face legal, commercial,
and/or shareholder pressures to “save face” and
“never admit culpability,” potentially closing off
these conciliatory remedial responses in the
minds of management. Yet apologies are a prerequisite for reconciliation (Lewicki & Bunker,
1996), and taking responsibility for the consequences of its actions in the face of such repercussions strongly indicates an organization’s
integrity and concern for those affected (Korsgaard et al., 2002). For example, BP’s decision to
admit responsibility for the 2005 Texas City fire
and to compensate bereaved families was heralded as “very brave” by industry commentators
(The Guardian, 2005). These responses also signal a commitment to prevent future violations,
whereas avoidance of responsibility and reasonable compensatory actions may damage
trustworthiness still further, particularly if legal
battles and/or public condemnation ensues.3
Apologies will be most effective when an
internal versus external attribution of responsibility is used (Kim, Dirks Cooper, & Ferrin 2006;
Tomlinson et al., 2004), with the sincerity of acknowledging direct responsibility (internal attribution) outweighing the negative implications
from conceded guilt. In contrast, alternative responses— excuses, reticence, or citing external
attributions—will be viewed as deceptive and
will therefore be less effective (Schlenker et al.,
2001), given the diagnostic evidence of the organization’s partial or full responsibility for the
failure, coupled with employees’ “insider knowledge.”
Proposition 6: Following the diagnosis
of an organizational failure, (a) an
apology with internal attribution will
be more effective than no apology or

Chemical) remains besmirched two decades after the Bhopal chemical leak, largely because of the company’s failure

victim groups and much of the public. The incident remains
the subject of class action in New York City courts.

January

an apology with external attribution,
and (b) offers of reparations to affected
stakeholders will be more effective
than no offers of reparations in restoring employees’ perceived organizational trustworthiness.
Trust repair mechanisms. To reiterate, individuals tend to weigh positive information more
heavily than negative information when related
to ability, but negative information more heavily
than positive information when related to integrity (Snyder & Stukas, 1999). Reeder and Brewer’s
(1979) notion of “hierarchically restricted
schema” suggests this is because the “scope of
infection” differs for failures of ability versus
failures of integrity. After an ability violation,
positive demonstrations of competence will reduce the likelihood the violation will be seen as
a reliable indicator of incompetence, because
people believe intuitively that those with competence can exhibit performance at a variety of
levels, whereas those who are incompetent cannot (Kim et al., 2004). In contrast, failures of integrity or, we suggest, benevolence are inherently moral in nature and tend to be viewed as
reflecting grievous and enduring deficiencies of
character that can be generalizable to other circumstances in the future (Kim et al., 2004). After
an integrity or benevolence failure, a positive
display of these qualities is likely to be discounted as a signal of renewed trustworthiness,
given that those both with and without integrity
and benevolence can “display” honesty and
concern in certain situations. Consequently,
these failures will be more difficult to remedy on
the basis of positive trustworthiness demonstration. Interventions designed to constrain future
malevolent behavior (distrust regulation) will be
more convincing and effective. Hence, while
both mechanisms are important for trust repair,
we propose the following.
Proposition 7a: Trustworthiness demonstration mechanisms will be more
effective for repairing employees’ perceptions of organizational trustworthiness after an ability failure than after
integrity or benevolence failures.
Proposition 7b: Distrust regulation
mechanisms will be more effective for
repairing employees’ perceptions of organizational trustworthiness after in-

<-----Page 14----->2009

Gillespie and Dietz

tegrity and benevolence failures than
after an ability failure.

Stage 4: Evaluation
Evaluations assessing the progress and effectiveness of the interventions function as a distrust regulation mechanism, identifying any
persistent problem areas in the organization’s
defense against future violations. They provide
ongoing diagnostic data to refine and embed
reforming interventions and, importantly,
achieve congruence in the trust-related signals
emanating from the multiple organizational
components. Given the difficulty of achieving
congruence and repairing trust system-wide,
successive cycles of evaluation followed by reforming interventions are likely to be required.
By institutionalizing the measurement of trust
levels, regular evaluations maintain attention
and effort on the trust repair process, enhancing
its effectiveness and sustainability over time.
We do not consider an evaluation to be essential for trust repair, since restoring perceived organizational trustworthiness is possible without an evaluation. Rather, an
evaluation will augment the effectiveness of
trust repair efforts and will strengthen perceived organizational trustworthiness. If the
evaluation stage is skipped, it will be difficult
to know how effective the repair efforts have
been, and outstanding problems in the organizational system that damage organizational
trustworthiness will not be detected and,
hence, will remain unresolved.
Similar to the diagnosis, an effective evaluation needs to be accurate, systemic, multilevel, timely, and transparent. With these
qualities, the act of conducting evaluations,
feeding back results, and implementing further reforms based on the results signals ability (i.e., due diligence), benevolence (i.e., seeking input and reinforcing concern to rebuild
relationships), and integrity (i.e., openness,
honesty, and ensuring commitments are fulfilled). In this respect, evaluations function
also as a trustworthiness demonstration
mechanism.
Proposition 8: Evaluating the effectiveness of the reforming interventions
and acting on the results will enhance

141

employees’ perceived organizational
trustworthiness.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND
PRACTICE
Despite the frequency of organizational failures reported in the media, to our knowledge,
this is the first paper to provide managers and
consultants faced with the formidable challenge
of restoring employees’ trust after a failure with
a framework of principles, underlying mechanisms, and a recommended process to guide
organizational trust repair.
Our framework highlights a number of dilemmas inherent in the trust repair process, which
deserve further attention. One is the tension between the need for a “speedy response” and the
time required to ensure “due process.” Prioritizing speed risks not appreciating all factors contributing to the failure, resulting in superficial
actions that tackle symptoms but not the
cause(s). Yet too slow of a response is likely to
engender frustration and cynicism and risks
leaving the causes of the failure “live.” The
timeliness of the interventions may, therefore,
influence perceived trustworthiness in a curvilinear fashion (similar to Proposition 5b). Stage 1
of our trust repair process aims to balance both
requirements. Future research is needed to explore the relative effectiveness of strategies for
managing this tension and the factors that influence the perceived timeliness of responses
(e.g., Do interim reports help? Should interventions first target the organizational components
most amenable to change?).
A second consideration is the cost-benefit
analysis of full trust repair versus a more limited response. While we have argued for the
necessity and merits of a comprehensive approach, this is not without potential costs and
risks. A systemic diagnosis and set of interventions involves substantial time, effort, and resources and may require widespread adaptation to organizational components to achieve
congruence. This diversion of resources may impede the organization’s competence in other areas. A transparent “warts and all” diagnosis
may further damage the organization’s internal
and external reputation for trustworthiness, at
least in the short term. Research is required to
explore this potential paradoxical effect and

<-----Page 15----->142

Academy of Management Review

whether it is ameliorated by a voluntary diagnosis, as we suggest.
Where the organizational failure results in
harm to other stakeholders, an implication of
our framework is that restoring employees’ perceptions of trustworthiness requires reparative
actions toward other affected stakeholders. This
raises the challenge of balancing the potentially incompatible concerns, needs, and expectations of employees with those of customers,
investors, and regulators. To what extent and
under what circumstances, therefore, is reparative action toward other stakeholders pivotal to
repairing employees’ trust?
We confine our discussion of the interconnectedness of the organizational components to the
conceptual level, proposing that a systemic,
multilevel approach, coupled with the principle
of congruence, is central to effective trust repair.
Further research is required to understand the
specific interactions and interdependencies
among the six components and how these influence trust repair. Following Klein and Kozlowski
(2000: 20 –21), are interventions to components
“proximal” to the direct experience of employees (e.g., structures, policies, and processes;
work unit management practice and climate)
more effective than interventions to more “distal” components (e.g., cultural change, revised
strategies, new senior leadership)? Or is proximity to the failure—addressing the most apparent causes and components—more important?
How might the influence of each component differ across organizations and for employees in
different roles, levels, and locations?
Our framework assumes that employees’
perceptions of organizational trustworthiness
are damaged by the failure. However, this may
not be a universal response (Schwartz & Gibb,
1999: 37). Research is required to investigate
perceptions of organizational failures and
what explains different reactions. To operationalize organization-level failures, researchers can examine employees’ impressions of
the magnitude of the three conditions (within
the organization’s locus of control, causing actual or potential harm, threatening the organization’s legitimacy). We further suggest that
while intentionality is not a necessary condition, it will moderate the damage to perceptions of trustworthiness by contributing to interpretations of the failure’s magnitude. If the
organization’s (in)action is perceived as delib-

January

erate or premeditated (e.g., Firestone/Bridgestone’s keeping secret known potentially
deadly faults with their tires; BBC Online,
2000), the damage will be worse than if it is
perceived as unintended.
Another intriguing avenue for future research
is to examine our assertion that the assumptions
and recommendations for interpersonal trust repair are not readily transferable to the organizational level. Organizations have capacities for
trust repair unavailable to individuals, such as
replacing “guilty” agents with new agents who
symbolize a change in values, obtaining external validations of integrity and competence
(e.g., accreditations), and using public relations
and marketing activities to change their reputation.
When field studies into live trust repair processes are difficult to secure, we encourage retrospective case study methods (cf. Elangovan &
Shapiro, 1998), including document analysis and
interviews, to explore organizational decision
making and its outcomes, and thereby to test
aspects of our framework. Examining different
companies’ responses following a sector-wide
breakdown in trust (e.g., accounting firms’ consultant-auditor conflicts of interest post-Enron)
would help control for external factors and provide a clearer evaluation of different repair
strategies. Role play and scenario experiments
could also be used to test the relative influence
of different trust repair strategies in a controlled
way.
A concluding remark: While the influence of
the external environment should not be overstated, amoral and malevolent organizational
choices and errors often occur in response to
structurally embedded pressures and constraints (e.g., performance targets, tight budgets,
competitor tactics). A common impression is that
the imperatives and incentives that invite unethical opportunism are increasing while the
strength of countervailing constraints is decreasing (e.g., deregulation, ineffective monitoring), resulting in an external environment that is
more demanding, more unpredictable, and more
conducive to trust failures (Thompson, 2003). Yet
even in this hostile context, signals about which
behaviors are rewarded and punished are sent
by all of us, as citizens, customers, investors,
advisors, and employees.
