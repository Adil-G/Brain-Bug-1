PROSPECT IS VALUED LESS THAN ITS WORST
POSSIBLE OUTCOME*

Expected utility theory, prospect theory, and most other models of risky
choice are based on the fundamental premise that individuals choose among risky
prospects by balancing the value of the possible consequences. These models,
therefore, require that the value of a risky prospect lie between the value of that
prospect’s highest and lowest outcome. Although this requirement seems essential for any theory of risky decision-making, we document a violation of this
condition in which individuals value a risky prospect less than its worst possible
realization. This demonstration, which we term the uncertainty effect, draws from
more than 1000 experimental participants, and includes hypothetical and real
pricing and choice tasks, as well as field experiments in real markets with
financial incentives. Our results suggest that there are choice situations in which
decision-makers discount lotteries for uncertainty in a manner that cannot be
accommodated by standard models of risky choice.
From the time of Bernoulli on, it has been common to argue that (a) individuals tend to display aversion to the taking of risks, and (b) that risk aversion in
turn is an explanation for many observed phenomena in the economic world [Arrow
1971, p. 90].

I. INTRODUCTION
Most important decisions involve risk. Thus, it is not surprising that a substantial body of research has tried to understand
how decision-makers incorporate risk into their choices. Indeed,
risk aversion has played an essential role in helping to understand economic problems as diverse as insurance, contracting,
and portfolio selection (e.g., Arrow [1971], Grossman and Hart
[1983], and Markowitz [1959]). Most models of risky choice,
whether normative or descriptive, assume that individuals value
a risky prospect or lottery by some type of weighted average
scheme, thereby balancing the possibility of relatively good outcomes with the possibility of relatively poor outcomes. In the
classical treatment of decision-making under risk, expected utility theory, that balance is captured by a formulation in which the
utility of an outcome is weighted by the probability of that outcome occurring. Prospect theory also imposes a weighted average
scheme, in which the utility of an outcome is weighted by a

decision weight that typically overweights small probabilities and
underweights medium to large probabilities [Kahneman and
Tversky 1979; Tversky and Fox 1995; Tversky and Kahneman
1992].
The balancing operation invoked in both expected utility
theory and prospect theory imposes a basic and fundamental
requirement—the value of a risky prospect must lie between the
value of that prospect’s highest and lowest outcome. Indeed, this
requirement, which we call the internality axiom, seems so essential that many empirical measurement procedures preclude
violations of this axiom (see, e.g., Gonzalez and Wu [1999]). Contrary to this axiom, individuals in our investigations sometimes
value a risky prospect less than its worst possible realization. For
example, our experimental participants were willing to pay $38
for a restricted $50 gift certificate, yet were only willing to pay
$28 for a lottery ticket that provided an equal chance of that
certificate and a $100 certificate with the same restrictions. This
behavioral result, which we term the uncertainty effect, not only
contradicts expected utility and prospect theory but is inconsistent with virtually all models of risky choice.1 We demonstrate
the uncertainty effect in a series of studies involving hypothetical
and real pricing and choice tasks, as well as bidding in auctions in
a naturally occurring marketplace. We also identify some necessary conditions for the uncertainty effect and describe an alternative choice process that is consistent with our findings.
Our article is organized as follows. We begin by presenting a
graphical description of the uncertainty effect. We then present
several demonstrations of the uncertainty effect using a pricing
task. We next show the robustness of the uncertainty effect by
replicating the pricing results using choice questions. The final
set of treatments involves a field experiment that uses auctions
1. See Machina [1987], Camerer [1995], Starmer [2000], and Wu, Zhang, and
Gonzalez [2004] for reviews of risky choice models and empirical evidence. Most of
these models assume first-order stochastic dominance, a stronger axiom than
internality. Regret theory [Bell 1982; Fishburn 1982; Loomes and Sugden 1982]
and prospect theory as formalized in Kahneman and Tversky [1979] permit
violations of stochastic dominance but prohibit violations of internality (see Birnbaum [1992], Leland [1998], and Tversky and Kahneman [1986] for empirical
violations of first-order stochastic dominance). We are aware of two classes of
models that in principle permit violations of internality: the disappointment
models of Bell [1985] and Loomes and Sugden [1986] (but not Gul [1991]) and
models that allow for a “utility of gambling,” e.g., Conlisk [1993], Diecidue,
Schmidt, and Wakker [2004], Royden, Suppes, and Walsh [1959], and Schmidt
[1998] (but not Bleichrodt and Schmidt [2002]). The possibility of the uncertainty
effect, however, is not discussed in any of these papers.

conducted in real markets. We conclude with a discussion of what
may be driving the uncertainty effect and the implications of the
effect for models of risky choice.

II. THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT
The study of risky choice has a long and distinguished history. As noted above, virtually every model of risky choice requires that the value of a risky prospect, whether certainty equivalent, buying price, or selling price, lie between the value of the
prospect’s highest and lowest outcome. Consider, for example, a
lottery, denoted L ⫽ (x, p, y), that offers a p chance at x and 1 ⫺
p chance at y, where x ⬎ y. Expected utility, prospect theory, and
most other models of risky choice require that V(x) ⱖ V(L) ⱖ V(y),
where V(䡠) represents the value of a prospect. We term this
requirement the internality axiom. Figure I depicts the internal-

ity axiom graphically.2 The horizontal axis in Figure I represents
the probability p of obtaining the higher outcome x, and the
vertical axis represents the valuation of the prospect— either the
certainty equivalent, buying price, or selling price.
The valuation curves begin at V(y) and increase monotonically in p to V(x). For expected utility, the valuation curve is an
affine transformation of the inverse of the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function and hence is convex if the von NeumannMorgenstern utility function is concave. For prospect theory, the
valuation curve is typically concave and then convex, reflecting
the combination of a concave value function and an inverse
S-shaped probability weighting function. Most importantly for
our purposes, the curve for both models satisfies the internality
axiom—the value of any risky prospect lies between the value of
that prospect’s highest and lowest outcomes.
III. PRICING STUDIES
Our first empirical exploration of the uncertainty effect involved a series of hypothetical and real pricing tasks. All investigations used a between-subjects experimental design. We
present the questions sequentially and then conclude the section
with a general discussion of the results. The actual questions
used are found in Appendices 1 and 2. All statistical comparisons
use the Mann-Whitney test. Participants in all studies in this
section were University of Chicago students. Participants in the
hypothetical pricing studies were paid $1 for answering one
question.
III.A. Book Store Gift Certificates
We begin with a hypothetical pricing question. We asked
participants to state their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for either a
$50 Barnes and Noble gift certificate, a $100 Barnes and Noble
gift certificate, or one of five lotteries in which they would win
either the $50 or $100 gift certificate. The probabilities of the
better prize, the $100 gift certificate, were .99, .60, .50, .40, and
.01. Participants were told that the gift certificate had to be used
within the next two weeks. Table I summarizes the results.
The internality axiom requires that the WTP for the five
lotteries lie between the WTP for the two certain outcomes. On

tions in Figure I corresponding to the standard models of risky
choice, we find a pattern that is noncontinuous and nonmonotonic
over the probability interval. The function only rises above the
valuation of the prospect’s lowest outcome above p ⫽ .6 and does
not become monotonic until p ⬇ .4 or .5.
This demonstration of the uncertainty effect represents a
direct contradiction of the internality axiom. We examined the
robustness of this demonstration by running a variant conducted
for real stakes. Participants were again University of Chicago
students, who were paid $3 for participating in this study plus an
opportunity to receive some combination of cash and gift certificates. We used a random-lottery incentive procedure (see, e.g.,
Starmer and Sugden [1991]). Five percent of the participants had
their choices played out for real, in which case we also provided
them with $100 in cash to use for paying for either the gift
certificates or lotteries.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three condi-

tions. Individuals provided a maximum WTP or buying price for
either (i) a $50 gift certificate to a local bookstore; (ii) a $100 gift
certificate to the same local bookstore; or (iii) a lottery in which
they were equally likely to receive either the $50 or $100 gift
certificate (n ⫽ 20 for each condition).3 Buying prices (x) were
elicited using an incentive-compatible Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak [1964] mechanism. We placed a sealed envelope containing
a randomly determined offer y in front of each individual. Participants were told that they would buy the respective prize at y if
and only if x ⱖ y. Complete instructions are found in Appendix 2.
The results of the real-stakes study replicated the hypothetical study (see Table II). The average WTP for the $50 gift certificate (M ⫽ 38.0) was significantly higher than that for the lottery
offering an even chance at a $50 or $100 gift certificate (M ⫽ 28.0,
z ⫽ 2.30, p ⬍ .03).
III.B. Time Preference
Our second exploration had the same basic structure as the
gift certificate study, but involved intertemporal choice. Each
participant provided a WTP for either $100 received in one year,
$200 received in one year, or a lottery that paid either $100 or
$200 in one year, with equal probability. Results are summarized
in Table I.
The time preference questions revealed the same pattern as
3. We were unable to offer gift certificates to Barnes & Noble, because Barnes
& Noble was unwilling to provide gift certificates with an expiration date. The
smaller local bookstore was chosen because we wanted the participants to discount the value of the gift certificate below its face value.

the gift certificate questions: the average WTP for the lottery
(M ⫽ 32.5) was significantly less than the average WTP for the
lowest outcome of that lottery, $100 received in one year (M ⫽
43.6) (z ⫽ 2.17, p ⬍ .05).
III.C. Boring Task
Our final investigation in this section followed the structure
of the first two examples, but used monetary outcomes and a
different dependent measure. We asked participants to consider
“a boring and tedious task.” Participants were then asked: “What
is the longest amount of time you would be willing to spend on
this task for this payment?” Individuals thus provided a “willingness-to-work” in minutes. The payment for the hypothetical task
was either $25, $50, or a lottery that offered $25 or $50, with
equal probability. Table I summarizes the results.
Although the dependent measure in this example was nonmonetary, we found the same violation of internality observed in
the previous two demonstrations. Participants were willing to
work significantly less for the lottery between $25 and $50 (M ⫽
77.8) than for the sure $25 (M ⫽ 110.7) (z ⫽ 2.84, p ⬍ .01).
III.D. Discussion
The data presented in this section show a systematic violation of the internality axiom. Let L ⫽ (x, p, y) denote a lottery that
gives a p chance of x and 1 ⫺ p chance of y, where x ⬎ y. The
internality axiom requires that WTP(x) ⱖ WTP(L) ⱖ WTP(y). In
the three demonstrations presented in this section, we observed a
contrary pattern: WTP(y) ⬎ WTP(L).4 It is important to note that
we observed the expected monotonicity for certain outcomes: in
all cases, WTP(x) was significantly higher than WTP(y), where
x ⬎ y.
These demonstrations have two essential conditions. First,
our studies all involved between-subject tests. The internality
axiom is so transparent and compelling that we expect participants to obey internality in a within-subject test [MacCrimmon
and Larsson 1979]. Indeed, we conducted a within-subject investigation in which participants provided a hypothetical WTP for
three of the Barnes and Nobles gift certificate treatments—the
$50 gift certificate, the $100 gift certificate, and a 50/50 lottery
4. The last example uses willingness-to-work instead of willingness-to-pay,
but the logic is identical. For simplicity, we refer only to WTP.

<-----Page 8----->THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT

between the $50 and $100 gift certificates. As expected, 29 of our
30 participants priced the three objects in line with the internality axiom.
Second, respondents in our studies had to translate from the
lottery currency to the pricing currency. In the first example, it is
necessary to translate gift certificates into a monetary value. (We
obscured the translation by giving the gift certificates an expiration date.) In the second example, the delayed monetary payments must be converted to a present monetary value. In the final
example, monetary outcomes must be translated into time units.
To see why this is essential for producing the uncertainty effect,
note that respondents do not violate internality when asked to
price a lottery that gives $50 or $100, with equal probability (see,
e.g., Birnbaum et al. [1992]). So why do they violate internality
when gift certificates are substituted for cash?
We believe that respondents follow a process that differs
from that envisaged by either expected utility theory or prospect
theory. Consider an individual asked to state her WTP for a
lottery that gives equal chance of a $50 or $100 gift certificate.
These models suggest a process in which individuals assign a
value to the $50 gift certificate (say $25), assign a value to the
$100 gift certificate (say $45), and then price the lottery that
offers $25 or $45 with equal probability. In other words, individuals value the lottery by balancing the possibility of a better
outcome with the possibility of a worse outcome. Of course, internality would be satisfied if participants consistently converted all
nonmonetary outcomes to monetary equivalents in this manner
and then provided a WTP for the constructed cash lottery. Evidently, participants did not use such a process to value the risky
prospects investigated in this section.
We suggest that the data presented in this section and depicted graphically in Figure II can be accommodated by a simple
model in which decision-makers “code” a lottery in terms of “risk”
and “return” and then value the coded lottery. To see how this
process is compatible with our results, we apply this process
qualitatively to our lotteries. An individual posed with a lottery
that involves equal chance at a $50 and $100 gift certificate might
code this lottery as “a $75 gift certificate plus some risk.” She
might then assign a value to a $75 gift certificate (say $35), and
then reduce this amount (to say $15) to account for the uncertainty. Note that this process imposes only a modest constraint on
the size of the “risk premium,” and thus the resulting WTP could

<-----Page 9----->1292

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

well be lower than the WTP that she would have assigned to a
riskless $50 gift certificate (say $25) in isolation. In contrast, a
lottery that offers a .99 chance of a $50 gift certificate and a .01
chance of a $100 gift certificate might be coded as “a $50 gift
certificate plus some upside risk.” As a result, this lottery would
be valued higher than a sure $50 gift certificate (in accord with
the internality axiom) and thus higher than the equal chance
lottery (in violation of first-order stochastic dominance). We provide a more general discussion of this alternative decision-making process in the epilogue.
IV. CHOICE STUDIES
In this section we investigate the robustness of the uncertainty effect by using choice as a dependent measure. To do so, we
conducted a variation of the pricing studies using choice. Recall
that internality requires that the value of a lottery L between x
and y, x ⬎ y, exceed the value of y. Since we expect individuals to
prefer L to y in direct choice, we show the uncertainty effect using
an indirect choice paradigm. We introduce a third outcome z and
ask one set of respondents to choose between L and z and a second
set of respondents to choose between y and z. More formally, let
P(A,B) be the proportion of time option A is chosen over option B.
In terms of stochastic choice models (e.g., Luce and Suppes
[1965]), P(A,B) ⬎ .5 is interpreted as u(A) ⬎ u(B), where u()
denotes the utility of an alternative. Internality requires that
P(L,z) ⱖ P(y,z) for any alternative z.5
As before, all treatments were between-subject, and all participants in the hypothetical treatments were University of Chicago undergraduates who were paid $1 to answer one question.
The actual questions are found in Appendices 3 and 4. Statistical
comparisons employ a binomial test.
IV.A. Barnes and Noble Gift Certificate
We adapted the Barnes and Noble gift certificate demonstration using our indirect choice paradigm. We first consider our
hypothetical choice questions. Participants were given a choice
either between $25 in cash and a $50 gift certificate (Sure Thing
5. The necessary condition for this interpretation is some form of regularity.
For example, substitutability requires that U(y) ⬎ U(L) if P(y,z) ⬎ P(L,z) for any
z [Tversky and Russo 1969].

Condition, n ⫽ 28), or between $25 in cash and a lottery that
offered a $50 or $100 gift certificate with equal probability (Uncertainty Condition, n ⫽ 28). Internality requires that the percentage of respondents choosing $25 in cash be higher in the Sure
Thing Condition than in the Uncertainty Condition. The results
of the previous section suggest the opposite pattern. Indeed, the
percentage of respondents preferring the sure cash over the gift
certificate option was 21 percent in the Sure Thing Condition and
57 percent in the Uncertainty Condition (z ⫽ 2.74, p ⬍ .01), a
pattern inconsistent with the internality axiom and in accord
with the uncertainty effect.
We replicated these results using a choice between real gift
certificates and cash. The studies were conducted at The Technion in Israel. The Sure Thing Condition (n ⫽ 37) involved a
choice between 100 shekels in cash or a 200 shekel gift certificate
at The Technion book store. Participants in the Uncertainty Condition (n ⫽ 43) chose between a sure 100 shekels in cash or a
lottery which offered a 50 percent chance at a 200 shekel gift
certificate and a 50 percent chance at a 400 shekel gift certificate.
We employed a random-lottery incentive mechanism, in which
one participant in each condition had his or her choice played out
for real.
In accord with our hypothetical choice demonstration of the
uncertainty effect, we found that a significantly higher proportion
of participants chose the sure thing in the Uncertainty Condition
(74 percent) than in the Sure Thing Condition (43 percent, z ⫽
2.84, p ⬍ .01).6
IV.B. Time Preference
We adapted the time preference question from Section III in
a similar manner. Participants chose either between $60 immediately or $100 in one year (Sure Thing Condition, n ⫽ 72), or
between $60 immediately and a lottery that offered $100 or $200
in one year, with equal probability (Uncertainty Condition, n ⫽
76).
Results from this treatment replicate our previous findings:
more participants chose the $60 cash option when the other prize
was a lottery (47 percent) than when the other prize was a sure
thing (32 percent). The difference between the choice percentages
6. The exchange rate at the time of the study (July 2005) was approximately
4.55 shekels to one US dollar, or roughly $22 to 100 shekels.

<-----Page 11----->1294

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

in the Sure Thing and Uncertainty Conditions was nearly statistically significant at conventional levels (z ⫽ 1.92, p ⫽ .055), again
providing evidence of an indirect choice violation of the internality axiom.
IV.C. Boring Task
Finally, we modified the boring task study for the indirect
choice paradigm. Participants in the Sure Thing Condition (n ⫽
80) were told that their payment for the task would be $25, while
payment for participants in the Uncertainty Condition (n ⫽ 78)
was a lottery that offered $25 or $50, with equal probability.
Participants in both conditions were asked whether they would
be “willing to work 90 minutes in exchange for this
compensation.”
The majority of participants in both conditions indicated a
willingness to work for the compensation provided. The percentage of participants who would not be willing to work in the
Uncertainty Condition (26 percent), however, was significantly
higher than in the Sure Thing Condition (11 percent) (z ⫽ 2.34,
p ⬍ .05), consistent with the uncertainty effect.
IV.D. Discussion
Our choice studies exhibited the same pattern as the pricing
studies presented in the previous section. We used an indirect
choice paradigm to gauge preference for a lottery and the lottery’s
worst outcome. Relative to the third alternative, the choice percentage of the lottery was lower than the choice percentage of the
lottery’s worst outcome.7
Decision researchers have found that preferences revealed by
choice and pricing do not always agree. Most notably, Lichtenstein and Slovic [1917] demonstrated a preference reversal in
which participants priced one gamble higher than a second gam7. The questions in the section involved a small shift in wealth relative to the
pricing questions. In the pricing questions in Section III, we asked for buying
prices rather than certainty equivalents. Of course, the internality axiom requires
that the certainty equivalent (respectively, buying price) of a lottery exceed the
certainty equivalent (respectively, buying price) of a lottery’s lowest prize. For
expected utility, the certainty equivalent for a lottery, (x,p,y), is CE ⫽ u⫺1[pu(x) ⫹
(1 ⫺ p)u(y)], whereas the willingness-to-pay WTP is obtained by solving the
implicit equation pu(x ⫺ WTP) ⫹ (1 ⫺ p)u(y ⫺ WTP) ⫽ u(0) for WTP, where u(䡠)
is the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Both CE and WTP are monotonically increasing in p as long as u(䡠) is monotonically increasing. We thank an
anonymous reviewer for urging us to be more explicit about the method of valuing
lotteries in each case.

ble, but preferred the second gamble to the first gamble in direct
choice (see also Grether and Plott [1979] and Slovic and Lichtenstein [1983]). More generally, Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade
[1999] have suggested that pricing is often sensitive to features of
the problem presentation that are normatively irrelevant and
insensitive to aspects that are normatively essential (e.g., Boyle
et al. [1994]). The empirical results in this section, however,
indicate that the uncertainty effect is not unique to pricing, but
extends to choice situations as well.8
V. TREATMENTS

IN THE

MARKETPLACE

Although the results described above paint a picture that
some may consider compelling, some economists have been slow
to accept anomalous findings, partly because some studies suggest that certain behavioral tendencies are attenuated in market
settings (e.g., Chu and Chu [1990] and List [2003]). To provide
evidence of whether the uncertainty effect occurs in the marketplace, we look at bidding behavior in incentive-compatible auctions on the floor of a sportscard show.
The sportscard marketplace is a natural setting for an examination of preferences, as it provides a rich pool of participants
making decisions in a familiar environment, while also providing
natural variation of expertise. The field experiment was carried
out on the floor of various sportscard shows in Chantilly, Virginia,
in 2003. Each participant’s experience typically followed three
steps: (1) inspection of the goods, (2) learning the rules, and (3)
conclusion of the transaction. In Step 1, a potential subject approached the experimenter’s table and inquired about the sale of
the baseball card displayed on the table. The experimenter then
invited the potential subject to take about five minutes to participate in an experiment (auction). If the participant accepted the
invitation, then he was allocated to one of ten treatments.
We summarize the experimental design in Table III. The
setup of the field experimental design is similar to the studies
presented in the previous treatments: in six treatments (three
hypothetical and three actual), we used a “superior” good, “inferior” good, and a 50/50 lottery between the two (rows 1, 2, and 4
8. We speculate that there also might be an extension of the uncertainty
effect for decision under uncertainty. In future research, we hope to explore the
parallels between findings such as the Ellsberg paradox and the phenomena
documented here.

of Table III). To provide variation in the quality of the goods, we
used the grading system of a well-known third party, Professional
Sports Authenticators (PSA).9 The “superior” good was a Ken
Griffey, Jr. 1989 Upper Deck baseball card graded “Mint 9” by
PSA, and the “inferior” good was an otherwise identical variant, but
graded “Near Mint 8” by PSA. The PSA 8 card was identical to the
PSA 9, but for slight fraying on one corner. This difference in quality
maps into a difference of $60 in “book value”—the PSA 9 card had a
book value of $100 whereas the PSA 8 “booked” for $40.
The other four treatments represented variations of the lotteries used in sections III and IV. In two treatments (row 3 in
Table III), we used a positively skewed lottery with a 90 percent
chance of winning the PSA 8 card and a 10 percent chance of
winning the PSA 9 card. In the final two treatments (row 5 in
Table III), the lottery was an equal chance of receiving the PSA 8
card or $100 in cash. The cash prize was chosen to be equivalent
to the book price of the PSA 9 card.
In Step 2 of the experiment, the participant learned the
allocation rules. For example, following the hypothetical treatments with the student participants, we had participants answer
the following type of question (this is verbatim the question from
the PSA 9 hypothetical exercise; Appendix 5 includes complete
instructions for the PSA 9 auction):
Imagine that you have the opportunity to purchase the baseball card on the
table: the 1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Jr. PSA 9 card.
How much would you pay for the card here and now? $_______________

The other four hypothetical treatments were similar in structure.
Our allocation mechanism was a Vickrey [1961] second-price
auction, an auction that has proved straightforward in other field
experiments (see, e.g., List [2001]). Finally, in Step 3 the experimenter explained that the participant should return at 5 P.M. on
Sunday to find out the auction results. If a participant did not
return for the specified transaction time, she would be contacted
and would receive her card in the mail (postage paid by the
experimenter) within three days of receipt of her payment.
9. PSA, which grades cards on a 1–10 scale (10 being the best card), is the
world’s largest sportscard grading and authentication service, currently accepting
over 300,000 trading cards per month for grading. PSA is the most widely accepted grading standard in the sportscard market, and maintains co-branded
grading and authentication sites with eBay, Yahoo, and other online commerce
and content sites. The first card ever graded by PSA was the famous T206 Honus
Wagner card that sold for $1.2 million in 2000.

Before proceeding to the results summary, we mention a few
noteworthy aspects of the experimental design. First, no participant participated in more than one treatment, hence the design
was between-subject as in the treatments discussed earlier. Second, if the individual agreed to participate, she could pick up and
visually examine each card (in sealed cardholders, with the
graded card condition clearly marked). The experimenter worked
one-on-one with the participant, and imposed no time limit on her
inspection of the cards. Third, the treatment type was changed at
the top of each hour, so each participant’s treatment type was
determined based on the time they visited the table at the card
show.
V.A. Results
The results of the field experimental data are summarized in
Table III. All comparisons are by means of a Mann-Whitney test.
First, the results of Sections III and IV replicate in the hypothetical treatments in the marketplace: agents valued the 50/50 card
lottery (M ⫽ 34.09) significantly less than they valued the worst
possible realization (PSA 8, M ⫽ 52.72, z ⫽ 2.97, p ⬍ .01). The
uncertainty effect extended to the two variations, the 10/90 lottery (M ⫽ 26.48, z ⫽ 3.92, p ⬍ .001), as well as the 50/50 lottery
in which we substituted $100 for the PSA 9 card (M ⫽ 19.70, z ⫽
3.81, p ⬍ .001).
Next we consider the bids in the actual auction. While the bid
level in the actual auctions is lower than in the hypothetical
treatments, the uncertainty effect is alive and well in the marketplace: the average bid for the 50/50 lottery of $18.03 is significantly lower than the average bid for the PSA 8 auction of $28.43
(z ⫽ 3.31, p ⬍ .001). The uncertainty effect also extended to the
10/90 lottery (M ⫽ 20.62, z ⫽ 2.72, p ⬍ .01) as well as to the
lottery with a cash prize of $100 (M ⫽ 21.59, z ⫽ 2.58, p ⬍ .01).
Finally, note that the average bid for the positively skewed
10/90 lottery of $20.62 was higher, although not significantly so,
than the average bid of the stochastically dominating 50/50 lottery of $18.03 (z ⫽ 1.55, p ⫽ .13). We contrast this result to our
earlier pricing study, where we found that a more extremely
positively skewed lottery was priced higher than both the lottery’s worst outcome and the stochastically dominating 50/50
lottery. We depict these results in Figure III.

VI. EPILOGUE
Expected utility theory and prospect theory are based on
the same fundamental premise: individuals choose among
risky prospects by balancing the value of the possible consequences. Contrary to this premise, we document an uncertainty
effect—individuals value a lottery less than the lottery’s worst
outcome. The uncertainty effect was demonstrated in pricing
tasks (the WTP for a lottery was lower than the WTP for the
lottery’s worst outcome), and choice tasks (relative to a third
alternative, the choice percentage for a lottery was lower than
the choice percentage for the lottery’s worst outcome). We also
found the uncertainty effect for real as well as hypothetical
choices and in a field experiment using hypothetical as well as
actual auctions.
Although the uncertainty effect proved to be robust in our
demonstrations, these demonstrations appear to require two es-

<-----Page 17----->1300

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

sential conditions.10 First, our treatments are all between-subject
investigations. The internality axiom is so normatively compelling that it will be followed when the problem presentation suggests that the axiom should be applied. Our between-subject
treatments make no such demands on our participants, however.11 Expected utility theory and alternatives to expected utility such as prospect theory require a correspondence between
choices at hand and other choices that the decision-maker could
face. The uncertainty effect suggests that the correspondence
between such choices might in some cases be limited.
Second, the objects in our lotteries have a different currency
than the pricing currency or the comparison alternative. We
discuss two reasons why this is essential. First, the application of
internality is transparent and compelling when a decision-maker
is asked to price a lottery with a high prize of $200 and a low prize
of $100. Second, the need to translate from one dimension to
another dimension increases the cognitive demands on our participants.12 For example, Tversky and Shafir [1992] suggested
that there is a “loss of acuity induced by uncertainty.” In one
study, they had respondents consider a lottery that offered an
equal chance to win $200 or lose $100. When asked whether they
would take a second identical gamble, most respondents accepted
the gamble if they had won the first one, accepted the gamble if
they had lost the first one, but rejected the gamble if they did not
know whether they had won or lost. More recently, van Dijk and
Zeelenberg [2003] found an effect in the spirit of our uncertainty
effect: participants were more likely to continue with plans to
open a new restaurant when market potential was high (35
percent) than low (15 percent), but were least likely to continue
when told that market potential was uncertain and between 15 to
35 percent. In sum, these studies suggest that individuals may
find it difficult or unnatural to think through the possible conse10. Of course, the uncertainty effect also must be calibrated for the particular
subject population. For example, we conducted a pilot of the real-stakes choice
experiment at the University of Maryland. However, the parameters were poorly
calibrated, and most participants in both conditions preferred the cash to the gift
certificates. A more detailed description of this pilot is available upon request.
11. Other researchers have demonstrated related differences between within- and between-subject treatments (e.g., Fox and Tversky [1995], Hsee et al.
[1999], Kahneman and Tversky [1996], and Tversky and Shafir [1992]).
12. This insight is consonant with data from our field auctions, which suggest
that dealers, who have intense experience with sportscards, do not violate the
internality axiom. Our preferred interpretation is that dealers are “coding” the
sportscards as money rather than as a good for final consumption.

<-----Page 18----->THE UNCERTAINTY EFFECT

quences of a risky choice and that they, as a result, may alter
their choice process to deal with the conflict [Shafir 1994; Shafir,
Simonson, and Tversky 1993].
Both expected utility theory and prospect theory impose a
weighted average scheme, and are thus incompatible with the
uncertainty effect. Although these models are unable to accommodate the uncertainty effect, research in this direction has been
enormously productive: prospect theory has organized the standard violations of expected utility and predicted new violations of
expected utility. Parametric forms for these models have been
proposed [Gonzalez and Wu 1999; Tversky and Fox 1995; Tversky
and Kahneman 1992], and these models have been used with
success in applications (see, e.g., Benartzi and Thaler [1995] and
Gneezy and Potters [1997]). Thus, our results should not suggest
abandoning expected utility theory or alternatives to expected
utility such as prospect theory.
Nevertheless, we do envision a process for incorporating a
decision-maker’s aversion to risk that departs from both expected
utility theory as well as prospect theory. In expected utility theory, risk aversion is modeled by the curvature of the utility
function, whereas in prospect theory, risk aversion may also be
captured by loss aversion and curvature of the probability weighting function [Tversky and Kahneman 1992; Wakker 1994]. The
present research suggests that there are choice situations in
which decision-makers discount lotteries for uncertainty in a
manner that is difficult to reconcile with standard models.

The potential exchange (Gift Certificates)
Your decision is to state how much you would be willing to
pay for a $50 ($100) Gift Certificate for the 57th Street Coop.
The gift certificate can be used within the next two weeks.
Please indicate a maximum buying price for the $50 ($100)
gift certificate. If you indicate a maximum buying price of x, you
would buy the $50 ($100) gift certificate if we offered the certificate for a price less than x, and you would not buy the $50 ($100)
gift certificate if we offered a price greater than x.
The envelope in front of me has a predetermined price offer y.
After you indicate your buying price, we will randomly select one
of you (the person selected is random and is not related to your
buying price statement), and then open the envelope.
If the price y is less than or equal to your buying price x, then
the randomly chosen person will buy the $50 ($100) gift certificate
(since the price is below your buying price). The price that person
would pay is y.
If the price y is greater than your buying price x, then you
will not buy the $50 ($100) gift certificate (since the price is above
your buying price). It is best under this system for you to provide
your true maximum buying price: the highest amount of money
that you would be willing to pay for the $50 ($100) gift certificate.
The potential exchange (Lottery)
Your decision is to state how much you would be willing to
pay for a lottery ticket that gives you a 50 percent chance at a $50
gift certificate for the 57th Street Coop, and a 50 percent chance
at a $100 gift certificate for the 57th Street Coop. Whichever gift
certificate you win is good for use within the next two weeks. We
will flip a coin to determine which prize you get. If the coin comes
up heads, you will get the $50 gift certificate. If the coin comes up
tails, then you will get the $100 gift certificate.
Please indicate a maximum buying price for the lottery
ticket. If you indicate a maximum buying price of x, you would
buy the lottery ticket if we offered it for a price less than x, and
you would not buy the lottery ticket if we offered a price greater
than x.
The envelope in front of me has a predetermined price offer y.
After you indicate your buying price, we will randomly select one
of you (the person selected is random and is not related to your

APPENDIX 5: MARKET AUCTION INSTRUCTIONS
Welcome to Lister’s Auctions! You have the opportunity to
bid in an auction for the baseball card on the table.

<-----Page 23----->1306

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

The card up for auction is the 1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey,
Jr. PSA 9 card on the table.
Auction Rules: A sealed bid second-price auction will be used
to determine the winner. Thus, if your bid of $X is the highest bid
and the next highest bid is $X-5, you win the card, but only pay
$X-5. Under this bidding mechanism it is best for you to bid your
true reservation value: the largest amount of money that, if you
won the auction, you would be comfortable paying for the card
here and now. This is so because bidding over this value may
cause you to pay too much and bidding under this value decreases
your odds of winning the card. Let’s now go over an example that
shows why bidding your reservation value makes sense.
For example, if the top four bids are ranked highest to lowest as
follows:
$A
$B
$C
$D
the bidder who bid $A wins the card and pays $B.
Now let’s discuss why bidding your true reservation value
makes sense.
Would you like to go over another example?
I will accept bids from the first 50 bidders. I will announce
the winner of the auction Sunday at 5 PM.
Given that the winner of the card will pay a price equal to the
amount of the second-highest bid, please place your bid below:
My bid for the 1989 Ken Griffey Jr. PSA 9 card: $_________
After the winner pays me cash or check for the card, the card
will be awarded to the winner (I pay postage). Please sign on the
line below to verify your bid. Also, please provide your name,
telephone number, and mailing address below:
