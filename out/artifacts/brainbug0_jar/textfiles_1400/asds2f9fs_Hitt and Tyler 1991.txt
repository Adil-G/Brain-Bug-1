Different perspectives of strategic decision-making and outcomes have been advanced in the
literature. Among those are the rational normative, external control, and strategic choice
models. The current research examined hypothesized effects of factors associated with these
three perspectives on strategic acquisition decisions. Strong support was found for the
rationallanalytical normative choice perspective with objective criteria explaining the greatest
amount of total explained variance in evaluation of target firms. However, industry and
executive characteristicsalso produced main effects on targetfirm evaluations. Furthermore,
the strategic decision models were found to vary by industry and executive characteristics
of age, educational degree type, amount and type of work experience, and level (CEO and
below). The results suggest that strategic decision models are quite complex with significant
implications for future research and for strategic decision-making.

INTRODUCTION
The normative model of strategic decision-making
suggests that executives examine the firm's
external environment and internal conditions
and, using the set of objective criteria derived
from these analyses, decide on the strategy. A
model of strategic change that builds on this
rational normative model by emphasizing the
effects that executives can have on strategic
decisions, has been labelled strategic choice
(Child, 1972; Montanari, 1978). An alternative
view, the external control perspective (Romanelli
and Tushman, 1986), argues that strategic
decisions are largely constrained by the external
environment. The chief proponents of this highly
deterministic perspective (Bourgeois, 1984) are
from diverse disciplines and include industrial
organization economists (e.g. Bain, 1956; Porter,
1980; Scherer, 1980) and organization theorists

strategic

(e.g. Aldrich, 1979; Hannan and Freeman, 1977).,
While the two perspectives seem to be in strong
conflict, proponents of each seem to be moving
closer together (Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987;
Hrebiniak, Joyce and Snow, 1988). Recently
theoretical and empirical models, that argue for
elements of both strategic choice and external
control in strategic decisions, have surfaced in
the literature (Astley and Van de Ven, 1983;
Finkelstein, 1988; Hrebiniak and Joyce, 1985;
Keats and Hitt, 1988).
A direct extension of the choice-determinism
debate is the question of whether managers
matter (Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987). External control proponents tend to view managers as
unimportant, inactive, or, at most, symbolic
(Astley and Van de Ven, 1983; Pfeffer and
Salancik, 1978). This view emphasizes the definite
limits to which autonomous strategic choice is
available and the limited ability of organizations to
adapt to different niches within the environment
(Aldrich, 1979). Strategic choice advocates, however, emphasize the potential effects that managers can have on strategic decisions. They argue

a difference in strategy formulation and implementation (Finkelstein, 1988; Gupta and Govindarajan, 1984; Miller and Toulouse, 1986). However,
much more research is needed to determine when
and how upper echelon orientations, and the
characteristics on which they are based, affect
the strategic decision process.
Current research thus supports the necessity
of integrating elements of the rational normative,
external control, and strategic choice perspectives
in models of the strategic decision process.
Bourgeois (1984) and Hrebiniak et al. (1988)
called for strategy research that combines and
examines the interaction of the different perspectives. The purpose of this research is to examine
top executives' strategic decisions in an effort to
understand more fully the effects of factors
associated with these three perspectives on
strategic decisions. Specifically, executives'
decisions regarding potential acquisitions are
modeled to examine the extent to which objective

that people, not organizations, make decisions
and that the decisions depend on prior processes
of human perception and evaluation (Child,
1972). These processes are believed to be
constrained by the managerial orientation created
by needs, values, experiences, expectations,
and cognitions of the manager (Child, 1972;
Finkelstein, 1988; Montanari, 1978). Hambrick
and Mason (1984) advocated an upper echelons
theory of organizations, which builds on the
premises of earlier strategic choice literature (i.e.
Child, 1972; Montanari, 1978). This perspective
suggests that strategic choices are the result of
both the objective situation and the characteristics
of the upper echelons (top executives) of the
organization. It argues that upper echelon characteristics (psychological cognitive bases, values,
and observable background characteristics) affect
managerial perception and, therefore, strategic
choices. Research has supported the contention
that managers' personal characteristics do make

criteria are used, and the extent to which the
decisions and criteria chosen are affected by the
firm's industry and by the executives' characteristics. A model of the hypothesized relationships
is presented in Figure 1.

RATIONAL NORMATIVE MODEL
Early development of the strategic management
literature advanced a rational, normative model
of strategic choice (Andrews, 1971; Ansoff, 1965;
Hofer and Schendel, 1978). As a result, the
normative model of strategy formulation and
implementation remains dominant in the teaching
and practice of strategic management. Porter
(1980), among others, has offered a complex set
of analyses designed to help executives formulate
an effective competitive strategy. Most top
executives have been exposed to this or other
forms of the normative model, either through
formal education or executive development programs. In fact, most of the Fortune 1000 firms
now have formal systems for strategic planning
(Leontiades, 1980). Although the normative
models vary somewhat, there is a dominant
theme in this classical approach. These models
suggest that managers must analyze both their
external environment and internal operations
(Pearce and Robinson, 1983). From these analyses, lists of external opportunities and threats and
internal strengths and weaknesses are derived. A
strategy is formulated in the context of these
opportunities and threats, and firm strengths and
weaknesses. This strategy, to the extent possible,
should be designed to optimize achievement of
the firms' goals (Porter, 1980). Thus, according
to this model, strategic decision-making involves
a series of sequential, rational, and analytical
processes (Huff and Reger, 1987) whereby a set
of objective criteria are used to evaluate strategic
alternatives (Ackoff, 1981; Ansoff, 1980, 1986;
Camillus, 1982). Some suggest that this process
involves strategic choice. However, Bourgeois
(1984) argued that this rational normative model
is quite deterministic. While there may be some
choice, the process is designed to narrow strategic
alternatives to the best one or at least, a small
feasible set. Therefore, the choice is highly
constrained and is guided by a rational process.
Additionally, Bourgeois argued that strategy,
once determined, often placed constraints on
future strategic alternatives considered.

Acquisition decisions represent a type of
organizational decision that can be expected to
follow the sequential, rational, and analytical
process advocated by the rational normative
model. Most acquisition research has employed
a rational choice perspective and argues for
consideration of the importance of strategic or
organizational fit (Jemison and Sitkin, 1986). It
can be argued that executives of firms considering
acquisitions should carefully analyze both their
external environment and internal operations and
use the resulting analysis to evaluate potential
acquisitions. Alternative characteristics of acquisition candidates will vary along an infinite
number of objective dimensions. However, given
the limits of human information processing
capabilities, a top executive evaluating different
potential acquisitions can be expected to simplify
the decision process by limiting the criteria
considered and by weighing some criteria more
heavily than others (Duhaime and Schwenk,
1985; March and Simon, 1958; Schwenk, 1984).
Thus, many firms use fornmalstrategic planning
processes and top managers have been exposed
to rational analytical strategic planning models.
In addition, top executives in firms considering
acquisition candidates can be expected to follow
the premises of the normative strategic decisionmaking model. As a result, we propose the
following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: A set of objective criteria
explains a significant amount of variance in the
strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates,
above and beyond the variance explained by
other variables.

Most current advocates of the rational normative perspective realize that strategic decisions
are not without constraints, both environmental
and individual. For example, Bourgeois (1984)
argued that a theory of organizational functioning
must account for the possibility of reciprocal
causation among external factors, strategic
decisions, and internal organizational factors.
The works of Hambrick and Mason (1984) and
Schwenk (1986) suggest that the human actors
(e.g. top executives) also affect the strategic
choices made. Thus, we also examine the external
control and the upper echelons strategic choice
perspectives.

EXTERNAL CONTROL
The external control perspective suggests that
the success of strategic decisions is largely
determined by characteristics of the external
environment. This deterministic perspective has
grown from two disparate yet largely supportive
theory bases: organization theory and industrial
organization economics. Early organizational
researchers established the environment as a
source of critical contingencies (e.g. Emory
and Trist, 1965; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1969).
Organization theorists (e.g. Duncan, 1972; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1969) proposed that environmental turbulence and uncertainty had major
effects on organizational functioning. From this
earlier work grew resource dependence and
natural selection models (Aldrich, 1979; Pfeffer
and Salancik, 1978; Hannan and Freeman, 1977).
These approaches suggest that the design and
choices of organizations are based on the
complexity of the environment (Bourgeois, 1984).
For example, Keats and Hitt (1988) noted that
resource scarcity in a firm's existing markets
increases the firm's risk, suggesting a need to
expand into new markets. Thus, resource scarcity
may drive strategic choices and, in turn, firm
performance. Natural selection models argue that
an organization's potential for survival and
superior performance is dependent on the match
or fit between organizational design variables
and environmental demands (Aldrich, 1979).
This perspective argues for consideration of
the organization-environment relationship at the
population level (industry), where organizational
aggregates are homogeneous in environmental
vulnerability.
The organization theory perspective is largely
congruent with that of industrial organization
economics. Industrial organization economists
(Bain, 1956; Hirshleifer, 1988; Scherer, 1980)
argue that an industry's structure is a major
determinant of the profitability in the industry
and thus serves as a powerful influence on
strategic decisions (Barney and Ouchi, 1986).
The industry structure characteristics believed to
have the most influence on strategic choices are
concentration, heterogeneity, and existence and
height of entry barriers (Bain, 1956; Hirshleifer,
1988; Porter, 1980; Scherer, 1980). The industry's
structural characteristics are also believed to have
a major effect on firm profitability (Bourgeois,

1984; Hatten, Schendel and Cooper, 1978;
Schendel and Patton, 1978). Bourgeois (1984)
denotes that the deterministic nature of external
control theories evolved from classic microeconomic theory whereby firm survival requires the
firm to develop long-run economies of scale and
focus financial resources and managerial attention
on manufacturing efficiencies. Therefore, industry characteristics likely have direct effects on
strategic decisions.
Although a firm's relevant environment
includes both social and economic forces, Porter
(1980) argues that the major aspect of the
environment is the industry(ies) in which a firm
competes. Furthermore, he suggests that industry
structure is a strong influence on the competitive
rules in the industry and therefore on firms'
strategies. Likewise, resource dependence and
natural selection models suggest that environmental pressures are often evidenced at the industry
level. Based on these premises, the following
hypothesis was formulated:

Hypothesis 2a: Industry explains a signzificant
amount of variance (main effects) in strategic
evaluation of acquisition candidates, above
and beyond the variance explained by other
variables.

However, industry structure varies considerably
across industries and the importance of objective
criteria considered in numerous strategic decisions
can vary according to the associated industry.
Some industries are R&D-intensive (e.g.
pharmaceuticals) while others emphasize marketing (e.g. toys, processed foods). Firms that are
R&D-intensive tend to diversify into other R&Dintensive industries (McDonald, 1985). As a
result, these firms likely place strong weight on
R&D capabilities when evaluating acquisition
candidates. Conversely, a toy manufacturer or
firm in the processed foods industry may weight
the marketing capabilities criterion heavily in
evaluating the attractiveness of acquisition candidates. Therefore, top executives in separate
industries with different structures may use and
weight criteria differently in strategic decisions.
As a result, there is a reciprocal interdependence
between industry and strategic decisions
(Bourgeois, 1984). Strategic decisions determine

<-----Page 5----->Strategic Decision Models
the industries in which a company participates,
but these industries, in turn, affect the objective
criteria relevant in strategic decisions.
In addition, Spender (1989) argued that executives are involved in a two-step process. While
the decision process has a rational component,
a process of judgement is used to deal with
uncertainty. He argued that judgement intervenes
in the proposed causal model that links the
executives' objective situation to their decisions.
Under conditions of uncertainty and information
deficiency, executives interpret and add to the
available objective data in order to make
decisions. Often, the burdens and risks of
exercising judgement cause executives to draw
their primary support from other executives
operating in the same industry. These executives
do not seek detailed or prescriptive formulae
because they know that organizations in the
same industries are in different circumstances.
However, executives 'adopt a way of looking at
their situations that are widely shared within
their industry' (p. 188). Spender (1989) labeled
this pattern of judgements the industry's 'recipe'.
An industry recipe is similar to the concepts of
managerial dominant logic (Prahalad and Bettis,
1986) and managerial mind sets (decision-making
orientations) based on a firm's center of gravity
(Galbraith, 1983). Supportive of Spender's arguments, Finkelstein (1988) found that industry
moderated the managerial orientation-strategy
relationship. These arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2b: Industry moderates the
relationship between objective criteria and the
strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates.

Both the rational normative and external
control models largely reduce the decision regarding strategic moves to one of mechanics ignoring
the 'human actors'. While both of these schools
of thought have merits as evidenced by the
preceding hypotheses, ignoring the human
element in strategic decisions can lead to inaccurate predictions by the models. Therefore, to
develop a nWorecomprehensive and accurate
understanding of strategic decisions, we incorporate the upper echelons perspective of strategic
choice.

331

STRATEGIC CHOICE
Child (1972) suggested that top managers make
strategic choices. That is, they make decisions
regarding the goals, domains, technologies and
structure of a firm. Keats and Hitt (1988) argue
that this perspective suggests that organizations
select and interpret their environment, respond
to those elements that are fixed, and attempt to
shape the remaining elements to their advantage.
Hambrick and Mason (1984) and Bourgeois
(1984) emphasize that executives' strategic choices should be viewed broadly to include not only
variables normally associated with strategy (e.g.
domain selection) but also those associated
with its implementation (e.g. reward systems).
Regardless of the extent of strategic choice, these
theorists reject the purely deterministic view of
the behavior of organizations taken by some
organization theorists and industrial organization
economists. They also qualify the assumption of
objectivity associated with the classical normative
model of strategic choice.
Some of the early theorists (e.g. Andrews,
1971; Child, 1972) who proferred the rational or
classical models of strategic decision-making
recognized that perceptual and evaluational processes of managers played a role in strategic
decisions. More recently, others have examined
the link between top management characteristics
and perceptions, objective decision criteria and
strategic choice (Finkelstein, 1988; Hambrick
and Mason, 1984; Schwenk, 1984, 1986). The
theoretical arguments proposed are based on an
extensive literature that has accumulated in the
area of behavioral decision theory (Sebora, Crant
and Shank, 1990; Walsh, 1989). Research prior
to the advent of behavioral decision theory
assumed that rational economic actors maximize
their utility based on full, complete, and perfect
information. Behavioral decision research suggests that people violate the rational normative
utility-maximizing model (Sebora, Crant and
Shank, 1990).
Much of the work integrating behavioral
decision theory into the strategic decisionmaking literature has been based on early notions
of Tversky and Kahneman (1973, 1974, 1981).
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and Slovic,
Fischhoff and Lichtenstein (1977) stated that
when faced with uncertain, complex and/or illstructured problems (e.g. strategic decisions),

<-----Page 6----->332

M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler

individuals develop and use heuristics to simplify
the decision process. Most recent research has
demonstrated that human cognitive processes
attempt to reduce cognitive effort through the
use of heuristics which may create systematic
biases (Barnes, 1984; Kahneman and Tversky,
1979, 1987; Schwenk, 1984, 1986, 1988). By
using heuristics, decision-makers can make fairly
accurate interpretations and evaluations without
having to examine all available information
(Nisbett and Ross, 1980; Starbuck and Milliken,
1988). The literature in management and cognitive psychology suggests that individuals use these
heuristics or cognitive models to integrate pieces
of information into a single judgement in making
decisions (e.g. Hitt and Middlemist, 1979; MacCrimmon and Taylor, 1976; March and Simon,
1958).
Schwenk (1984) suggested that individual
characteristics affect the heuristics and cognitive
maps used to make strategic decisions, and
proposed three variable categories of individual
differences: cognitive style, demographic factors,
and personality traits (Schwenk, 1988). Upper
echelons theory, proposed by Hambrick and
Mason (1984), essentially argues that strategic
choices have a large behavioral component and
reflect the idiosyncrasies of top executives'
cognitive bases and values. Hambrick and Mason
(1984) argued that, while decision-makers are
exposed to an ongoing stream of potential stimuli,
these cognitive bases and values filter and distort
the decision-maker's perceptions, and thereby
affect strategic choice. They argued, further, that
observable demographic characteristics of top
executives could be used to infer psychological
cognitive bases and values, and that 'straightforward demographic data on managers may be
potent predictors of strategies' (p. 205). The
characteristics that they chose to develop included
age, functional tracks, career experiences, education, socioeconomic roots, financial position,
and group characteristics.
Work by behavioral decision theorists and
strategists (e.g. Hambrick and Mason, 1984;
Schwenk, 1984, 1988; Walsh, 1989), therefore,
suggests that executives do not follow a totally
rational model in making strategic decisions.
Furthermore, they may not interpret industry
information correctly or utilize all relevant and
available information. Thus, introduction of
human choice into strategic decisions alters the

strategic decision process. More specifically,
Duhaime and Schwenk (1985) suggested that a
number of specific simplifying processes may be
used in acquisition and divestment decisions.
individuals approach complex
Because
decisions with previously constructed heuristics
or cognitive models that are reflected in personal
characteristics, the following hypothesis was
developed:
Hypothesis 3a: Executives' personal characteristicsexplain a significant amount of variance
(main effects) in the strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates, above and beyond the
variance explained by other variables.
Hitt and Barr (1989) found that managers
approach ill-structured decisions with complex
and differentiated cognitive models. That is, the
criteria used and their weightings may vary with
the cognitive model used. As noted earlier,
Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed several
personal characteristics of upper echelon executives that are likely to affect strategic choices.
Additionally, Hambrick and Mason (1984) argued
that the interactions between situational and
demographic variables should be examined to
increase the understanding of the effects of
demographic characteristics of top managers on
decision processes. In this study several personal
characterstics-age, level of education, educational background, total years of work experience, functional experience, level in the firm (in
relation to CEO), cognitive complexity, and risk
propensity-were examined.
Age
Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed that an
executive's age affects strategic decisions; for
example, younger managers pursue riskier strategies. Additionally, they speculated that firms
with younger managers experience greater growth
and variability in performance. While age effects
may overlap with risk propensity, the effects may
be broader. For example, Hitt and Barr (1989)
found managers' ages affected compensation
decisions. Specifically, younger managers were
more willing to pay higher salaries to executives.
This may be due to evaluations of greater value
as opposed to a riskier posture. Ireland et al.
(1987) suggested that individuals of similar age

<-----Page 7----->Strategic Decision Models
have similar life experiences and potentially
similar values and beliefs stored as schemas. As
a result they suggest that younger managers may
place greater value on participative management
than do older managers. Research by Schuman
and Scott (1989) supports the contention that the
generational character created by the events
experienced by a cohort during its youth exerts
an important influence on later attitudes. They
found that memories of important political events
and social changes were structured by age, and
that adolescence and early adulthood was the
primary period for generational imprinting.
Thus, younger managers might not only evaluate riskier acquisition candidates more highly
(exhibit, more willingness to take greater risks)
but also use and weight criteria differently than
older managers (e.g. criteria related to growth
and type of managerial talent valued) leading to
the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3b: An executive's age moderates
the relationship between objective criteria and
strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates.
Educational background
Hambrick and Mason (1984) suggested that
executives' educational background provides an
indication of their knowledge and skill base. Not
only the amount but also the type of education
are relevant. The type and amount of education
one chooses serve as indicators of her or his
values and cognitive preferences. Thus, based
on personal values, cognitive preferences and
specialized education, we might expect those with
formal education in engineering to utilize different
cognitive models in making decisions than those
with formal education in liberal arts or business
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984).
Hitt and Barr (1989) found that managers with
higher levels of formal education made different
managerial compensation decisions from those
with less formal education. Hambrick and Mason
(1984) hypothesized that there is a positive
relationship between amount of managers' formal
education and a firm's innovation. That is,
highly educated managers are more favorably
predisposed toward, and more likely to promote,
innovation. Furthermore, they proposed that
firms having top managers with less formal
education experience more variability in perform-

333

ance. We may speculate that those with less
formal education have greater variance in their
cognitive models because these models are
partially the product of more general educational
training. As the education level increases, training
experiences and paradigmatic perspectives
become more specialized and focused, thereby
creating greater conformity in cognitive models.
Thus, we may conclude that amount and type of
formal education affect the cognitive models
developed and thereby the strategic choices
made. As a result, the following hypotheses were
developed:
Hypothesis 3c: An executive's educational
degree type moderates the relationship between
objective criteria and the strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates.
Hypothesis 3d: An executive's level of education moderates the relationship between objective criteria and the strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates.
Experience
Both the amount and type of work experience
are important. The amount of one's experience
may affect the strategic choices made and the
models/processes used in making those decisions.
Hitt and Barr (1989), for example, found that
more experienced managers differ from less
experienced managers in decisions regarding
compensation of other executives. Additionally,
Fredrickson (1985) found that the decision
processes of experienced managers differ markedly from those used by inexperienced managers
in making the same strategic decision. Experience
allows managers to test and 'fine-tune' a cognitive
model that produces more successful decisions.
Less experienced managers are more naive
(Fredrickson, 1985) and do not have the benefit
of knowledge based on the outcomes of multiple
past decisions. Thius, executives' cognitive models
are based partially on their career experiences
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984).
The type of experience (e.g. function) also may
affect one's cognitive framework and strategic
choices. Hitt, Ireland and Palia (1982), Hitt,
Ireland and Stadter (1982) and Hitt and Ireland
(1985, 1986) found relationships between importance placed on certain functions (distinctive
competencies), strategy and performance. Smith

<-----Page 8----->334

M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler

and White (1987) found a relationship between
a firm's strategy and the career specialization of
top executives. This implies that knowledge and
expertise in certain functions may be related to
executives' choices of strategy and resulting
performance. Dearborn and Simon (1958) found
that executives defined problems largely in terms
of the goals and tasks in their respective functional
areas. However, Walsh (1988) disputed Dearborn
and Simon's (1958) findings. He found that
managers with different functional experience did
not develop different belief structures. On the
other hand, Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed a more complex alignment. They suggested
that individuals in different groups of functions
develop distinctly different orientations to the
firm and its environment. Furthermore, they
suggested grouping functional experience into
output and throughput functions and those not
integrally involved in the organization's core
activities (e.g. law and finance).
We suspect that the relationship between type
of experience and strategic decisions may be
more complex than suggested by previous work.
For example, Walsh's (1988) sample seemed to
be dominated by middle managers in mid-careers.
The average age was 38; 80 percent earned less
than $50,000 annually (in 1983) and all were
enrolled in a two-year, part-time executive MBA
program. While this in no way invalidates his
results, they may not be totally generalizable
to top executives. Top executives often have
experience in multiple functions, although they
may have dominant experience in one or two.
Thus, their experience may be broader and richer
for strategic decision-making. Additionally, the
type and weighting of those experiences may well
have helped shape a cognitive model used
for making strategic decisions. Thus, while
distinctions between experience in separate functions may be inappropriate, different combinations of functional experiences may affect
strategic choices and the criteria on which they
are based. As a result the following hypotheses
were formulated:

Hypothesis 3f: The combination of different
functional experiencespossessed by an executive
moderates the relationship between objective
criteria and the strategic evaluation of acquisition candidates.
Level of executive

Ireland et al. (1987) found that strategic decision
processes varied by the managers' level in the
firm. They found, for example, that managers at
different levels had distinctly different perceptions
of the firm's strengths and weaknesses and of
environmental uncertainty. They speculated that
part of the reason for these differences related
to different decision models based on the
availability heuristic. According to Tversky and
Kahneman (1973), people often make decisions
by using information that can be easily recalled
(e.g. available information). The type and amount
of information available for strategic decisions
may vary by level. However, since Ireland et al.
(1987) examined the differences in top, middle,
and lower level executives and the current study
focused on top executives (i.e. vice presidents
and above), less differentiation may be expected
in this study.
However, Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed that managerial aspirations (and thus
strategic decisions) may vary based on the
proportion of managers' income tied to the
performance of a firm. Many incentive compensation plans closely link top executives' compensation to performance. A larger proportion of
the CEO's total compensation is linked to
performance than top executives below the CEO.
Hoskisson, Hitt and Hill (1989b) found that
differences in incentive compensation affected
the criteria executives used to make strategic
decisions. Thus, executives below the CEO may
use different models (than the CEO) to make
strategic decisions because of the criteria contained in executive incentive compensation plans.
As a result we may speculate that criteria on
which strategic choices are based may differ by
the level of the executive (below the CEO),
because of information availability and differences

and below) moderates the relationship between

Although Hambrick and Mason (1984) advocated the use of observable executive characteristics in studies of upper echelons theory, they
acknowledged that the progress of this research
stream could not go far without consideration
of the psychological and social psychological
characteristics that are represented by some
demographic characteristics. Schwenk (1988) suggested that cognitive styles and personality
characteristics represent two additional categories
of variables that reflect individual differences.
One of the cognitive style variables that has
received attention in decision-making research is
cognitive complexity. In addition, it can be
argued that risk propensity, a personality characteristic, may greatly affect strategic decision
processes.
Cognitive complexity
Schneier (1979) argued that cognitive complexity
was originally conceived as a variable that denotes
the structural complexity of an individual's
cognitive system. Psychological researchers propose that the number of constructs that a person
uses in constructing a social perception provides
evidence of structural complexity. Biere (1961)
argued that cognitive complexity is an ability to
differentiate the behavior of other individuals
along a number of personal constructs. Individuals
with relatively complex cognitive systems have a
greater number of personal constructs along
which to differentiate behavior in others than do
those with relatively simple cognitive systems.
The degree of complexity has been used to
predict how specific behavioral information is
transformed into social or clinical judgements
(i.e. Bonarius, 1965).
We can reasonably expect most top executives
to have certain minimum levels of cognitive
complexity, given the array of factors that they
must consider to fulfill their job responsibilities.
Top executives must deal with an incredible array
of problems and most strategic decisions are
quite complex. In addition to greater complexity,
Walsh (1988) found that managers' belief structures utilized for ill-structured problems were

335

more complex than previous authors suggested.
Thus, the cognitive structural capacity of even
top managers may be taxed.
Hambrick and Finkelstein (1987) argued that
a manager's discretion is constrained to some
extent by his or her ability to perceive options and
simultaneously to process information regarding
competing alternatives. They concluded that
managers with greater cognitive complexity will
have greater discretion in strategic choices
because they are aware of more alternatives and
are able to differentiate between a larger number
of dimensions.
Downey and Slocum (1982) found cognitive
complexity to moderate the relationship between
perceived environmental uncertainty and managerial performance. In other words, individuals'
cognitive abilities affected the manner in which
they perceived that uncertainty in the environment affected their performance. Therefore, the
effects of cognitive complexity relate to the
processing of information. As a result, it affects
the number and type (complex) of criteria and
alternatives evaluated in the decision. This leads
to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3h: An executive's cognitive complexity moderates the relationship between
objective criteria and strategic evaluation of
acquisition candidates.
Risk orientation
Much has been written about risk and strategic
decisions. In particular, recent strategic management research focused on the relationship
between risk and performance (e.g. Aaker and
Jacobson, 1987; Amit and Livnat, 1988; Barton,
1988; Fiegenbaum and Thomas, 1988; Singh,
1986). Most have assumed rationality in strategic
choices. However, there is a controversy regarding the relationship between a firm's risk and
return (Bowman, 1982, 1984). Fiegenbaum and
Thomas (1988) found that the relationship
between risk and return can be either positive
or negative. Their results supported prospect
theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Laughhunn, Payne and Crum, 1980) which suggests
that poor performance leads executives to take
higher risks. Baird and Thomas (1985) argued
that the relationship between strategic risk-taking
and performance is quite complex.

<-----Page 10----->336

M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler

One reason for this complexity is that strategic
decisions are made by and filtered through
executives. As a result, strategic decisions may
be partially affected by the managers' personal
propensity toward risk (Baird and Thomas, 1985).
For example, Williams (1965) suggested that
those who have a higher propensity to take risks
are likely to choose more uncertain decision
alternatives. However, others argue that individuals may adopt a mixture of risk-seeking and
risk-averse behaviors (Fiegenbaum and Thomas,
1988; Siegel, 1957). Sitkin, Pablo and Jemison
(1990) suggested that a firm's risk perceptions
and risk propensity affect merger decision processes. Top executives perceive the risk, and
their risk orientations strongly influence the firm's
orientation. While Gupta (1984) argued that top
executives exhibit a greater willingness to take
risks than the general population, Gupta and
Govindarajan (1984) found top executives' risk
propensity to vary. They found that executives
who had a higher tolerance for ambiguity
exhibit a greater willingness to take risks. While
acquisition decisions often involve considerable
ambiguity, the resulting decision may vary somewhat by acquiring firm's executives' risk propensity. Kogan and Wallach (1964) found that
individuals with a lower risk propensity used a
broader categorization of criteria in decisions,
whereas those with higher risk propensities used
a narrower categorization scheme. Furthermore,
not only the number but the type of criteria may
vary in these categorization schemes. Therefore,
an executive's risk orientation may affect the type
of criteria used to evaluate strategic alternatives.
These arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3i: An executive's risk propensity
moderates the relationship between objective
criteria and strategic evaluation of acquisition
candidates.

Follow-up phone calls to nonrespondents were
used to ensure a strong response rate. A total
of 69 responses were returned, for a 57 percent
response rate. Four of the responses had missing
data on at least one of the instruments for a
usable sample of 65. The levels (title) and
industries of executive respondents and their firms
were compared to those of the nonrespondents
(including those declining to participate). The
results suggested no systematic differences
between the groups. For example, the percentages
of respondents and nonrespondents by level were
almost identical (President/CEO-respondents 33
percent, nonrespondents 34 percent; executive
or senior vice president-respondents 22 percent,
nonrespondents 22 percent; vice presidentrespondents 45 percent, nonrespondents 44
percent). Comparison by industry showed a
slightly higher nonresponse rate from service
firms. However, further analysis of data from
initial or follow-up contacts showed that a number
of the nonresponses (or declines) in service
industries were in highly unique services (e.g.
galleries, commodity exchange) or were individuals not a part of the top management team (e.g.
some vice-presidents in financial institutions).
Therefore, they were not appropriate for this
study. As a result we concluded there was no
effective nonresponse bias.
The average age of the respondents was 47,
with an average of 24 years of total work
experience. The respondents' position ranged
from vice-president to CEO with the mean
position one level below the CEO (e.g. president
and COO). The firms represented a variety of
industries (20 different two-digit SIC codes)
including manufacturing (consumer goods, producer goods, capital goods) and services (e.g.
financial and professional services). The average
firm size was $550 million in annual sales.
Instrument

METHOD
Sample
Data were obtained through a survey instrument
mailed to 122 top executives (chosen randomly
using a random-number generator from a list of
950 top executives in the southwest United
States). Each executive was contacted by telephone and asked to participate in the study.

The instrument contained four parts including
30 cases with potential acquisition candidates
described through 15 objective criteria, a measure
of risk propensity, a measure of cognitive
complexity and a set of questions regarding
individual respondent and firm characteristics
(demographics). The order of the components in
the instruments sent to executives was randomly
determined to control for potential order effects.

<-----Page 11----->Strategic Decision Models
As noted earlier, industry may affect strategic
decisions (e.g. Dess, Ireland and Hitt, 1990).
Thus, industry was controlled in examining the
main effects of the other variables.

ranging from 0.85 to 0.96) related to favorable
perceptions of change in job activities providing
evidence of validity for the scale. The internal
reliability (coefficient alpha) for the scale in this
study was 0.66.

Objecti've criteria
The study examines executives' strategic decisionmaking. The type of decision chosen for examination involved the evaluation of firms targeted
for acquisition. The objective criteria on which
to evaluate target firms were developed through
a survey of the literature and recommendations
from academic 'experts'. Five academicians
knowledgeable of the strategy and mergers and
acquisitions literature were requested to identify
criteria used by executives to evaluate target
firms and make acquisition decisions. Basd on
the 'experts' recommendations and the literature
review, 15 objective criteria were identified. The
goal of the development process was to identify
all potentially important criteria while maintaining
a 'manageable' list for case development. The
target firm criteria chosen include level of
diversification, market share in firm's primary
industry, annual sales, return on investment,
stock price, anticipated discounted cash flow,
projected new products/services to be developed
over the next 5 years, projected demand for
products/services over the next 5 years, level of
management talent, capabilities in marketing,
capabilities in manufacturing, capabilities in
R&D, attractiveness of the firm's primary industry, degree of synergy with acquiring firm, and
acquisition price. These objective criteria were
used to develop 30 cases on target firms as
described later.
Risk propensity
Executives' propensity to take risks was measured
using the Job Preference Inventory (Williams,
1965). The inventory consists of eight pairs of
descriptive statements regarding a job. The
respondent is asked to choose the statement
which describes the job s/he would most prefer.
The statements describing a 'risky' job are scored
1 and statements describing a job with little or
no risk are scored as 0. Williams (1965) found
the reproducibility coefficients to range from 0.83
to 0.90. Further, studies found the scale to be
highly and positively (rank order correlations

Cognitive complexity
Cognitive complexity was measured using an
instrument developed by Bieri et al. (1966),
modified by Vannoy (1965) and validated by
Schneier (1979). Essentially the instrument
involves a 10 x 10 grid whereby the respondent
is asked to evaluate 10 specific persons (e.g.
boss, person who respondent dislikes, etc.)
including him/herself on 10 bipolar adjectives
using a six-point scale (for a total of 100 ratings).
The higher the score, the more cognitively simple
the person because she/he is using similar
constructs to describe each person. A person who
is more cognitively complex (lowwer score) uses
the constructs differently in discriminating among
people. Schneier (1979) found the instrument to
have a test-retest reliability of 0.54 (p < 0.01)
for a sample of students and 0.82 (p < 0.01)
for a sample of managers. Schneier also found
evidence of both convergent and discriminant
validity for the instrument.
Demographic characteristics
A number of individual and firm characteristics
were measured. The respondents' chronological
age was requested. Amount of education was
measured on a five-point scale ranging from high
school to a Ph.D. (high school, some college,
bachelors degree, masters degree, Ph.D.).
Additionally, the respondents were requested to
denote the major area of study if they held a
college degree (e.g. accounting, engineering,
liberal arts, etc.). Type of education (major area
of study) was coded as a dummy variable.
Respondents were asked to denote the industry
representing the greatest percentage of total firm
sales. This information was used to help classify
the firm into the correct two-digit SIC code. For
analytical purposes (e.g. testing hypotheses), the
firms were further classified into one of six
categories including consumer goods (manufacturers), capital goods, producer goods, financial services, professional services and other.
The sample was distributed across the industry

<-----Page 12----->338

M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler

categories in the following manner: consumer
goods (7), producer goods (19), capital goods
(10), financial services (8), professional services
(16), other (5). The other category is composed
of firms that could not be classified in one of
the other five categories. Industry was then coded
as a dummy variable.
In addition to the title of the current position,
the respondents provided the number of levels
between them and the CEO (0= CEO). They
also provided the chronological number of total
years of professional work experience.
Finally two measures of functional experience
were obtained. Respondents were asked to
denote whether they had work experience in one
or more of the functional areas (accounting,
engineering, finance, marketing, management,
R&D, personnel, production/manufacturing,
purchasing) or other areas. Each was coded as
a dummy variable (1 = experience, 0 = no
experience). The respondents also provided the
number of years experience in each function
(to the extent that such experience could be
specifically identified). Our sample was composed
of top executives, many of whom had general
manager experience for a number of years.
As such, they had responsibility for multiple
functional areas in the same job. Therefore,
our sample of top executives had broad and
overlapping experience. As a result our measure
of type of work experience is more complex than
has been examined in past studies (e.g. Walsh,
1988). These data presented no problem for
examining general main effects for personal
characteristics because we did not hypothesize
specific main effects for each separate characteristic. However, to test for the moderating effects
of work experience we needed to examine the
combination of experience across functional
areas. It would not be realistic or appropriate to
examine the effects of experience in each
functional area separately because of their interdependence. While we expected most top executives to have a broad experience base, we were
interested in determining whether the strategic
decision models of those with somewhat more
specialized experience differed from the others.
Therefore, a clustering technique was used
to differentiate group executives with similar
backgrounds. The clustering procedure used an
iterative algorithm for minimizing the sum of the
squared distances from the cluster means. As a

result it allowed the determination of groups with
the highest within-group similarities and the
greatest between-group differences (process used
to delineate the six clusters). Thus, to examine
moderating effects of type of experience, respondents were clustered according to the type and
number of years of functional experience.
The cluster analysis produced six distinct
clusters. However, the results also showed that
many of the respondents had similar backgrounds
(as expected from top executives with significant
general manager experience). The first cluster
contained 47 respondents and represented those
with a broad base of experience with some
experience in each of the functional areas (broadbased experience cluster). The remaining clusters
(except four and six) while having multifunctional
emphases, were also more specialized, each in
different ways. Cluster two included those with
a fairly broad base of experience but no
experience in finance or personnel (business and
technical cluster). Cluster three includes those
with heavy experience in finance, marketing,
management and personnel but no technical
experience (core business cluster). Clusters four
and six represent one respondent each who has
significant experience in engineering combined
with other experience that differentiates them
significantly from other respondents (technical
clusters). These clusters were dropped from
further analysis. Cluster five respondents had
dominant experience in engineering, management
and production but little or no other business
functional experience (technical management
cluster). For purposes of the moderated
regression analyses, this variable was coded as a
dummy variable.
Size of the firm was used as a control variable.
In particular, firm size might affect the emphasis
on specific criteria. Thus, to ensure that other
effects examined were not contaminated by firm
size, it was controlled in the primary analyses.
Firm size was measured using total annual firm
sales and total number of employees.
Decision models
The procedure known as policy capturing (Slovic
and Lichtenstein, 1971; Hobson and Gibson,
1983) was used to obtain and analyze the data.
Such a procedure has been used in past research
to model managers' decision processes (e.g.

<-----Page 13----->Strategic Decision Models
Ireland et al., 1987). The method is similar to a
repeated-measures design and allows assessment
of what Argyris and Schon (1974) described as
'theories in use' as opposed to 'espoused theories
of action.' Hitt and Middlemist (1979) conducted
post hoc interviews with superiors of the managers
in their study, revealing that the policy-capturing
models accurately represented actual decisionmaking behavior, providing support for the
external validity of the procedure.
For this study 30 cases were constructed by
randomly varying the level of each of the 15
target firm characteristics (criteria) on a scale of
one (low) to five (high) across the cases (a sample
case is shown in the Appendix). The random
assignment of criteria levels controlled for potential collinearity among the independent variables.
The highest r between any pair of criteria was
0.37 for a common variance of less than 14
percent.
Executives were asked to examine each case
describing a target firm on the basis of the 15
criteria and rate the attractiveness of the target
firm as an acquisition candidate (on a one to
seven scale) and rate the probability that this
firm would be acquired (on a one to seven scale).
The coefficient alpha for the scale combining
these two questions was 0.90. This combined
scale represented the dependent variable.
Each manager evaluated 30 target firms yielding
a sample size of 30 x 65 or 1950 observations.
The assumption of independence between each
of the respondent's 30 observations is consistent
with a within-subjects, repeated-measures design
(Wiiier, 1974). Precedent exists for the assumption that each case represents an independent
observation (Hitt and Middlemist, 1979; Hitt et
al., 1983; Stewart and Gelberd, 1972). To check
on the independence of the observations, we
examined the possibility of serial correlation
among within-person observations (only the
objective criteria varied in the within-person
observations-personal demographics and industry represent between-person effects). We used
a common procedure to block within-person
variance (dummy variables for each respondent)
and examined the remaining (between-person)
variance explained by the objective criteria.
Using hierarchical regression analysis we found
the objective criteria to explain slightly over 30
percent of the variance (model R2 > 0.40) in the
strategic decisions beyond the control variables

339

(individual dummy variables had an R2 = 0.085).
These results suggest that the data are relatively
free of serial correlation (within respondents)
and support the independence of individual
observations.
Pilot study
A pilot study was conducted with executives
involved in a 4-week development program to
evaluate the use of the instruments. The executives required a minimum of 30 minutes and
maximum of 1 hour to complete all parts of
the instrument. The data were analyzed and
individual results were provided to and discussed
with each executive. The exercise suggested that
the cases were viable and criteria used were
inclusive of those felt important by the executives.
Furthermore, the feedback provided guidance
regarding the type of instructions necessary for
executives to accurately complete the instruments.
RESULTS
The intercorrelation matrices are presented in
Tables 1 and 2. The data were aggregated and
Hypotheses 1, 2a and 3a were analyzed using
hierarchical regression. To control for the effects
of firm size, annual firm sales (sales and number
of employees were highly correlated) was entered
into each regression model. The results of these
analyses are shown in Table 3. The differences
in R2 were tested using a procedure recommended
by Cohen (1968) which accounts for the degrees
of freedom.
As shown in Table 3, Hypotheses 1, 2a and
3a were all supported. The table also shows that
the main effects for objective criteria were by
far the strongest. In Model 1, industry, personal
characteristics, and firm sales accounted for
slightly over 7 percent of the variance in
evaluation of target firms. However, addition of
the objective criteria to the model added almost
33 percent to the explained variance. This
provides strong support for Hypothesis 1.
The addition of industry variables to the
hierarchical regression model (Model 2) increased
the R2 by 0.022. This change was statistically
significant and thus Hypothesis 2a was supported.
The addition of personal characteristics to the
hierarchical regression model increased the variance explained by almost 3 percent. The change

was statistically significant, thereby providing
support for Hypothesis 3a.
Hypotheses 2b and 3b-3i were tested using
moderated regression analysis. This type of
analysis yields a conservative estimate of the
moderating effects of one variable (e.g.
industry-Hypothesis 2b) on the relationship
between two or more other variables (in this
case, objective criteria and the evaluation of
target firms) (Darrow and Kahl, 1983). Thus, in
this study, these analyses test the effects variables
have on executives' acquisition decision models.
The same method used for the hierarchical
regression analyses (Cohen, 1968) was used to
test the change in R2 between the restricted (main
effects) and full models (main and interaction
effects). The results of these analyses are presented in Table 4.
As shown, six of the nine moderated regression
results produced statistically significant changes in
R2. Industry (categories), age, type of education,
amount of work experience, type of work
experience and level of the executive were found
to be statistically significant moderators of the
relationship between objective criteria and evaluations of target firms; thereby providing support
for Hypotheses 2b, 3b, 3c, 3e, 3f and 3g.
An executive's cognitive complexity, level of
education and risk orientation were not found to
be statistically significant moderators. Thus, no
support was found for Hypotheses 3d, 3h and
3i. These results suggest that the industry in
which a firm competes, executives' age, type of
education, amount and type of experience and
organizational level tend to affect their strategic
decision models. As might be expected, age
and amount of work experience were highly
correlated, with a r = 0.97. Because of this
collinearity, further analyses were conducted in
an attempt to examine their true independent
effects. We partitioned the variance explained by
each variable in moderated regression models.
The results showed that neither age nor amount
of work experience explained a statistically
significant amount of variance beyond the other
in these analyses. As a result, an age/work
experience index was created by standardizing (z
score) each and obtaining a mean of the two sets
of standardizedscores for each respondent. Next,
a moderated regression analysis was conducted
using this index as the moderator. As shown in
Table 4, age/work experience index is a statisti-

341

cally significant moderator (at p < 0.01).
To examine how each of the moderating
variables tended to affect executive strategic
decision models, further regression models were
developed for each category (e.g. different type
of industry) where moderating effects were found.
While interesting, these stepwise regression models are not presented because they are beyond
the scope of this article. However, these results
may be obtained from the authors.

DISCUSSION
The results showed that elements of the rational
normative, external control, and strategic choice
perspectives of strategic decision-making are
operative. Additionally, the research suggests
that objective criteria play a prominent role in
executives' strategic decision models. However,
industry and executive characteristics also produced statistically significantbut small main effects
on strategic decisions, as well as moderating
effects on the criteria used in those decisions.
While the effects are not large, these findings
appear relevant, considering the conservative
nature of the test used. Therefore, the research
suggests that strategic decisions cannot be accurately modeled with one perspective alone. The
results support Fredrickson's (1985) conclusion
that executives' approaches to strategic decisions
were simultaneously rational and intuitive.
The dominance of the objective criteria in
executives' strategic decision models provides
strong support for the normative strategic choice
perspective. Almost 82 percent of the total
explained variance in executives' strategic
decisions was attributed to objective criteria.
These results suggest that a rational analytical
approach dominates strategic decision processes.
Additionally, these results are very similar to
those of Rumelt (1991) when he partitioned the
total variance in performance among FTC Line
of Business reporting units into industry factors,
time factors, corporate factors, and businessspecific factors. He found that stable business
effects were six times as important as stable
industry effects in explaining the dispersion of
rate of returns. This suggests that returns of
business units differ from one another within
industries to a much greater extent than industries
differ from one another. He concluded that

impediments to the long-term rates of return are
associated with unique endowments, positions,
and strategies of individual businesses.
Interestingly, however, such a rational
approach to strategic decisions is supposed
to account for environmental conditions, yet
industry contributed a statistically significant but
small addition to the explained variance above
and beyond that which was explained by other
variables examined. The results support those of

Rumelt (1989), who found small but stable effects
of industry on firm performance. These results
provide support for the influence of the external
control perspective. Thus, we might conclude
that the strategic decision process may be, at
least, partially deterministic. Perhaps even more
importantly, however, the results suggest that
the objective criteria used in making strategic
decisions may vary by industry. The results
suggest, then, that industry has both direct

<-----Page 19----->Strategic Decision Models
and moderating effects on executives' strategic
decisions. Thus, industry characteristics may
contribute to the development of managerial
orientations in the form of an industry recipe
(Spender, 1989). Over time, experience in an
industry may focus an executive's attention on
certain criteria while ignoring others (Starbuck
and Milliken, 1988). Therefore, executives evaluating target firms place emphasis on criteria
important in their firm's as well as the target
firm's primary industry. The results support the
Bourgeois (1984) conclusion that a reciprocal
interdependence exists between industry and
strategic decisions.
The results also provide some support for
Hambrick and Mason's (1984) upper echelons
theory. Essentially, the results suggest that
executives matter above and beyond rational
analytical processes and industry characteristics.
Executive characteristics produced main and
moderating effects on strategic decision models.
The results support contentions by a number of
theorists (e.g. Gupta, 1988; Norburn, 1989) that
an accurate understanding of strategic decisions
requires consideration of the effects of executives'
personal characteristics. While the results did not
support fully all contentions of Hambrick and
Mason's (1984) upper echelons theory related to
specific individual characteristics, they denote
effects of executive characteristics on decisions.
Furthermore, they suggest that upper echelons
theory as originally proposed by Hambrick and
Mason may need some refinement.
While this study was not a complete test of
upper echelons theory as proposed by Hambrick
and Mason (1984), support was found for
the effects of executives' age, years of work
experience, functional experience, and type of
education. However, no support was found for
the effects of level of formal education on
strategic decisions (except in selected subgroup
analyses). The results support Tversky and
Kahneman's (1981) assertions that decision
frames adopted are controlled partially by the
personal characteristics of the decision-maker.
Furthermore, the results suggest that, while some
cognitive simplification occurs (Schwenk, 1984),
executives' strategic decisions are also incredibly
complex. Executives use rational analytic
approaches but their strategic decisions may also
be affected by their firms' industry and their own
personal characteristics.

345

Upper echelons theory may require modification to include executive level as a differentiating variable. The results herein focused on
top executives assumed to be a part of the top
management team (TMT) but found differences
in the strategic models by level (in the inclusion
and weighting of several strategic decision
criteria). Of course, the CEO may be considered
the most important executive in the TMT for
strategic decisions. Robbins and Duncan (1988)
argued the importance of CEOs in the creation
and implementation of strategic vision. However,
a CEO's ability to create and implement a
strategic vision could be affected considerably by
the extent to which other members of the TMT
agree with and support that vision. The effects
of executive level on strategic decisions support
current work on the importance of the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the TMT (e.g. O'Reilly
and Flatt, 1989).
Additionally, we found that most top executives
are generalists with broad functional experience.
However, even though most executives had a
broad experience base, there were differences in
the combinations of interrelated experiences (we
found four separate clusters after eliminating
two outliers). Furthermore, we found that the
strategic decision models varied across executives
with different combinations of experience. Thus,
the types and effects of experience may be more
complex than previously suggested.
Risk propensity and cognitive complexity were
not found to be universally important as hypothesized. The results do not allow rejection of the
importance of risk propensity and cognitive
complexity. However, they should be examined
in conjunction with other characteristics to obtain
a more accurate picture of their effects on
strategic decisions.
We should recognize that the range of cognitive
complexity among individuals narrows considerably as they move up the managerial hierarchy.
Thus, there may not be significant variance
among top executives' cognitive complexity. In
this study, cognitive complexity ranged from a
score of 91 (high complexity) to 279 (low
complexity). The mean score was 130 suggesting
a distribution skewed toward higher complexity.
Risk taking was significantly negatively associated with age in some early studies (Vroom and
Pahl, 1971; Wallach and Kogen, 1961). However,
it is interesting to note the significant positive

<-----Page 20----->346

M. A. Hitt and B. B. Tyler

relationship between age, experience, executive
level (CEO = 0), and risk (Table 2) suggesting
top executives to be unique. As the governing
body of an organization, top executives cannot
afford to exhibit the lack of confidence. Thus,
managers that show confidence and ability to
make necessary but risky decisions become the
top executives of an organization. This suggests
a potential range restriction in risk propensity
among top executives. The mean risk propensity
for executives in our sample was 6.5 and the
mode 8 (22 executives had a risk propensity score
of 8), thereby supporting this notion.
Our findings suggest that selection and socialization processes for top executive positions likely
narrow the individual differences between executives. Top management team members may not
differ greatly in individual characteristics (e.g.
experience, risk propersity). These findings suggest a further modification of upper echelons
theory. Yet out findings also suggest that the
differences in individual characteristics that do
exist may well affect strategic decisions. Thus,
while the effects may not be as great as originally
proposed, upper echelons theory remains operative.
Hambrick and Mason (1984) proposed that the
interrelationship among and effects of executive
characteristics are complex and difficult to disentangle. For example, age and amount of work
experience are highly interrelated, similar to
previous studies (e.g. Taylor, 1975). Analysis
suggested that the effects of these two factors
are inextricably interwoven and independent
effects of age and amount of work experience
may not be able to be isolated. Thus, it may be
advisable, in future research, to consider the
combined effects of these two factors.
Finally, while Walsh (1989) suggested that
policy capturing has high investigator involvement, this technique may actually be more
realistic for strategic decisions than techniques
used in past decision-making research. Rarely do
top executives conduct preliminary analyses on
potential acquisitions. Rather staff members or
other managers assimilate and analyze relevant
data and present executives with summary evaluations of targets (similar to the procedure in the
present study). As noted earlier, policy capturing
delineates models that are effective predictors of
managerial decision behavior (Hitt and Middlemist, 1979).

Additionally, the study focused on a strategic
decision of great importance to strategic management academicians and practitioners alike. The
1980s have been labeled by some as the decade
of merger mania. We need to understand
better the models on which strategic acquisition
decisions are made. For example, Duhaime and
Schwenk (1985) suggested that the quality of
the acquisition decision process influences the
subsequent success or failure of the resulting
acquisition. The results of this study support
theory and research on acquisition decisions.
Discounted cash flow was one of the most
important predictors (criteria) of acquisition
decision in our subgroup analyses. This supports
Jensen's (1986) contention that cash flow is the
critical criterion for diversification and acquisition
decisions.
Additionally, Roll's (1986) 'hubris hypothesis'
of corporate takeovers suggested that hubris on
the part of individual decision-makers causes
'mistaken estimates of target firm value' (p. 214).
If the individual bidder/manager is confident that
the market does not reflect the full economic
value of the combined firms, the bid for the
target will be greater than is economically
justifiable. Thus, pride or overconfidence, bolstered by past successes, may bias the bid price.
This 'hubris' may be the result of the manager's
personal characteristics.
Given the potential for individual characteristics to affect strategic evaluations, some may
argue that opportunity exists for managers to act
consciously against shareholder interests (Roll,
1986). While agency problems may exist, the
results of this study suggest that executive
effects do not necessarily represent conscious
opportunistic behavior. However, it also does
not preclude the potential for managers to act
in their own interests (i.e. utility functions),
which may diverge from shareholders' interests
(Hoskisson et al., 1989a). An application, in
future research, of agency theory to the cognitive
modeling of strategic decision processes would
be a valuable contribution (Eisenhardt, 1989).

CONCLUSIONS
A review of research related to environment,
strategy, structure, and performance revealed
an emphasis on objective measures with a

<-----Page 21----->Strategic Decision Models
disproportionate number of studies based on
quantitative data drawn from the PIMS and
Compustat data bases (Hrebiniak et al., 1988).
Furthermore, Hrebiniak et al. (1988) argued
that 'the skewing of strategy research in this
measurement direction has tended to underrepresent the intentional and cognitive aspects of
strategy.' Stubbart (1987) argued that future
research should focus on middle-range synthesis
of cognitive phenomena, linking them to broader
organizational phenomena. In addition, Stubbart
(1987) and Gupta (1988) concluded that future
research should focus on executive behavior. The
methodology employed in this study allowed
us to examine executives' strategic decision
behavior, use the behavioral data to construct
executive strategic decision models and overcome
some of the limitations of previous strategic
decision research as noted by Robey and Taggart
(1983).
This research provides new insights regarding
a potential source of emergent strategy. Rational
processes may dominate the strategy formulation
process, but industry and executive characteristics
may also affect the decision process. These
effects may be further amplified during strategy
implementation and may help explain at least
some of the variance between intended and
emergent strategy. Research related to the effect
of executives and industry on the strategy
implementation process provides a fruitful area
of future investigation.
Much more research is required before any
definitive conclusions can be reached regarding
the specific effects of individual executive characteristics on strategic decisions. Furthermore, this
study should be replicated with other types
of strategic decisions. However, this research
provides insight into the complex and multifaceted
relationship between the industrial environment,
objective business-level criteria, executive characteristics, and strategic decisions. Elements of
rational normative, external control, and strategic
choice (upper echelons theory) perspectives were
all found to contribute to the explanation of
strategic decisions. Barnes (1984) argued that
strategic planners must recognize their cognitive
biases and attempt to formulate strategic decisions
that accurately reflect the firm's strategic situation. Future research should examine more
precise formulations of upper echelons theory
with the purpose of disentangling the complexity

347

of strategic decisions. Furthermore, future
research should examine the effects of inertia
on strategic decision making (Fredrickson and
laquinto, 1989) and whether industry or executive
characteristics contribute to this inertia. Jackofsky
and Slocum (1988) argued that, despite the
importance of CEOs, there is a dearth of
knowledge about them. We expand this concern
to the top management team. The current
research provides a base on which a better
understanding of executive strategic decisionmaking may be developed.
