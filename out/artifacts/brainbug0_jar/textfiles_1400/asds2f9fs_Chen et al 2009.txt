We investigated the extent to which venture capitalists’ (VCs’) perceptions of “entrepreneurial passion” influence the VCs’ investment decisions. We defined entrepreneurial passion as an entrepreneur’s intense affective state accompanied by cognitive
and behavioral manifestations of high personal value. We conceptualized VCs’ decision making as a persuasion process in which entrepreneurs present a message (a
business plan) to attract investors using the “unimodel” of persuasion. After developing a measure of perceived passion and preparedness using an inductive, qualitative
approach, we conducted a laboratory experiment and a field study that consistently
showed that preparedness, not passion, positively impacted decisions to fund ventures.
The first crucial sign I’ve learned to look for is
passion.
-Jon P. Goodman, private investor
and Founder of EC2

sumers and society at large; for example, Starbucks
emphasizes its passion for people and its passion
about creating a “third place” where people can
relax and make connections, not just get coffee
(Kumar & Luo, 2006).
The passion displayed by entrepreneurs has been
one of the most frequently observed phenomena of
the entrepreneurial process (Smilor, 1997). Entrepreneurs have to sell their venture plans to potential investors, potential employees, and major customers. In such situations, passion is often critical
to convince the targeted individuals to invest their
money, time, and effort in the new venture. In
corporate settings, people championing new products seek top management support and resources
through powerful product presentations (Howell &
Boies, 2004). Passion is perhaps even more important in the nonprofit sector, where donors often do
not receive returns in terms of financial profits. In
this case, promoters of such ventures are required
to make a compelling case for the causes they endorse. Thus, passion, as an intangible, hard-to-measure quality of those asking for resources, can be
powerful and critical in many endeavors that are
aimed at creating something new in society.
Passion is a strong indicator of how motivated an
entrepreneur is in building a venture, whether
she/he is likely to continue pursuing goals when
confronted with difficulties, how well she/he articulates the vision to current and future employees,

There are many moments that are filled with despair
and agony, when you have to fire people and cancel
things and deal with very difficult situations . . . it’s
so hard (to build a company) that if you don’t have
a passion, you’ll give up.
-Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Inc.

Passion—a word often reserved for romance and
artistic work—is more prevalent than we normally
think. In the business world, nonromantic passion
is closely tied to economic activities. It is an important, albeit rarely recognized, factor in resource
allocation decisions made by managers, investors,
and consumers alike. To attract customers, producers of consumer goods often express their passion
for their products and what they can do for con-

and whether she/he will be able to influence, persuade, and lead people in growing the venture (cf.
Vallerand et al., 2003).
In this study, we investigated the extent to which
venture capitalists’ (VCs’) perceptions of the passion displayed by entrepreneurs in business plan
presentations influences their investment decision.
Research on VC funding decisions has suggested
that the venture idea or opportunity, the market,
the management team, and the entrepreneur making the pitch are among the variety of criteria VCs
use in making their funding decisions (Hall &
Hofer, 1993; Robinson, 1987; Tyebjee & Bruno,
1984). Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990), through a series of in-depth interviews with VCs, concluded
that VCs relied on their “gut feelings” about investing in proposed new ventures.
Prior entrepreneurship research has suggested
that factors that drive such “gut feelings” include
(1) the personality and background of the entrepreneur proposing a venture, (2) the characteristics of
the management team, and (3) the “interpersonal
chemistry” between the entrepreneurs and the VCs
(see Riquelme & Watson, 2002). These factors all
point to the “person” aspect of the proposed venture, indicating that VCs base their funding decisions in part on the technical, personal, and interpersonal capabilities of the entrepreneur proposing
a new venture. It is not surprising that Arthur Rock,
the legendary Silicon Valley VC, once remarked, “I
invest in people, not ideas. If you find good people,
if they’re wrong about the product, they’ll make a
switch, so what good is it to understand the product that they’re talking about in the first place?”
(quoted in Sahlman, 1997).
Arthur Rock’s comments suggest that investors in
general, and VCs in particular, hold implicit mental
models or theories about the types of factors that
have an impact on the success of a venture and
hence on that of the investment. As Zacharakis and
Shepherd (2001) speculated, in ambiguous and uncertain environments, where the claims made by an
entrepreneur are difficult to verify, VCs’ subjective
evaluation of the entrepreneur’s personal qualities,
such as his or her “passion,” is psychologically
functional because it often boosts the VCs’ confidence in their evaluation of the business plan.
To study the role of passion in the VC investment
decision context, we viewed the process by which
entrepreneurs secure funding from VCs through presenting business plans as a “persuasion process” (Elsbach & Kramer, 2003; Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001.
We employed the “unimodel” (Kruglanski & Thompson, 1999a, 1999b) found in the social judgment and
attitude formation and change literatures to ground
the arguments leading to our hypotheses. Using this

February

model, we addressed the part of the decision process
that has been traditionally missing from the VC decision literature—namely, the interpersonal, dynamic
judgment process based on the perceptions of entrepreneurs and venture teams. Further, by studying
passion and its impact on a typical resource allocation decision, we intended to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms driving such decisions in
other contexts.
PASSION, PREPAREDNESS, AND
VENTURE SUCCESS
Passion and Preparedness
Passion is often associated with “love,” be it love
in romantic relationships, or in nonromantic settings such as work. Social psychologists have
treated passion as a motivational construct that
contains affective, cognitive, and behavioral components. For example, Vallerand et al. defined passion as “a strong inclination toward an activity that
people like [affective], that they find important
[cognitive], and in which they invest time and energy [behavioral]” (2003: 756). Similarly, Perttula
defined passion for one’s work as “a psychological
state characterized by intense positive emotional
arousal, internal drive and full engagement with
personally meaningful work activities” (2003: 15).
These two definitions suggest that passion helps
direct one’s attention and actions and that it is a
domain-specific motivational construct. It is domain-specific because one needs to have a target of
love for passion, and this target is often a specific
activity or a collection of activities that embody
certain implicit or explicit values.1 Therefore, one
can be passionate about golfing, a single activity
reflecting achievement or hedonism as a value, or
one can be passionate about helping others through
volunteering and raising money for charities, multiple activities reflecting benevolence as a value
(Schwartz & Bardi, 2001).
In the entrepreneurship literature, attempts to
define passion share a common emphasis on affect,
especially positive affect. For example, Baum and
Locke called passion (for work) “love” for work
(2004: 588). Shane, Locke, and Collins called it a

1

This definition is similar to the definition of “selfefficacy,” (Bandura, 1977) in that self-efficacy is also a
domain-specific motivational construct. However, selfefficacy refers to an individual’s subjective feeling and
judgment of being able to accomplish a specific task,
whereas passion refers to an individual’s intense affect
toward a specific target that bears cognitive and behavioral manifestations of high personal value.

<-----Page 2----->2009

Chen, Yao, and Kotha

“selfish love of work” (2003: 268). Smilor defined
passion as the “enthusiasm, joy, and even zeal that
come from the energetic and unflagging pursuit of a
worthy, challenging, and uplifting purpose” (1997:
342) and thus effectively qualified it as an affective
experience that accompanies actions laden with
value. Cardon, Wincent, Singh, and Drnovsek defined it as consciously accessible intense positive
feelings experienced by engagement in entrepreneurial activities, associated with roles that are
meaningful and salient to the self-identity of the
entrepreneur (in press: 12).
Building on these definitions from the social psychological and entrepreneurship literatures, we define “entrepreneurial passion” as an entrepreneur’s
intense affective state accompanied by cognitive
and behavioral manifestations of high personal
value. We explicate two aspects of this definition
with greater clarity. First, the intense affective state
is accompanied by cognition and behaviors. Passionate individuals not only experience intense
emotions—their minds are also extremely active
(e.g., “I can’t stop thinking about the business venture idea”)—and they are likely to take action to
address their passion (see Baron [2008] for a
broader theoretical discussion of how affect impacts entrepreneurial cognitive and behavioral processes). To distinguish the affective from the cognitive dimension of the passion construct, in this
study we label the affective aspect “passion” and
the cognitive aspect “preparedness.” Later, when
we discuss the passion construct, we use the latter
term instead of “passion” alone. We acknowledge
that passion is a multidimensional construct; however, in this study we chose to focus on the visible,
outward expressions of an entrepreneur’s passion.
Second, although the passion experience is largely
positive (Busenitz & Barney, 1997), it does not exclude negative affective states such as anxiety or
fear, since people can hold ambivalent emotions
(i.e., emotions of opposite valence) regarding an
issue (Fong & Tiedens, 2002).
Linking Affective and Cognitive Passion to
Venture Success
Although few rigorous academic studies about
entrepreneurial passion exist, some recent studies
have alluded to the importance of passion in venture performance. For example, Baum, Locke, and
Smith (2001) empirically tested a multidimensional model of venture growth, with one of their
main predictors being passion. These authors
found that entrepreneurs’ traits, including tenacity,
proactivity, and passion for work, exerted positive
effects on venture growth. More importantly, pas-

201

sionate entrepreneurs also showed greater motivation and a higher propensity to grow their ventures
when compared to others in their sample.
A few others have studied the role of social competence and its influence on entrepreneurs’ financial success.2 Baron and Markman (2000, 2003), for
example, found that self-reported expressiveness
(one’s tendency and ability to express emotions)
was positively related to entrepreneurs’ business
incomes and their companies’ sales revenues. They
concluded that the perceived expressiveness of an
individual’s emotion in a social setting is a predictor of the financial success of entrepreneurial ventures (see also Spence, Donovan, & BrechmanToussaint, 1999). In another study, Baron and Tang
(in press) demonstrated that entrepreneurs’ expressiveness was a significant predictor of financial
results such as growth in sales, earnings, and employment in new ventures in China. Recently,
Baron (2008) stated that high levels of affect not
only made entrepreneurs more persuasive, but also
contributed to the breadth of their social networks,
which in turn increased their social capital. As a
result of increased social capital, these entrepreneurs had a higher probability of achieving success
in new ventures.
In contrast to these studies, Elsbach and Kramer’s
(2003) study provided direct evidence supporting
the notion that VCs may consider perceived entrepreneurial passion when they make investment
funding decisions. Elsbach and Kramer documented how studio executives and producers (investors, in this context) engaged in “prototype
matching” to assess the creative potential of relatively unknown screenwriters (“pitchers”) in Hollywood pitch meetings. Within the first few minutes of a pitch, producers quickly categorized the
pitcher into a preexisting prototype, within either a
“creative” category (e.g., “artist,” “storyteller”) or
an uncreative category (e.g., “journeyman”). One of
the most important attributes used in identifying
the creative prototypes was passion, which was
mentioned frequently in all forms of their data (interviews, observations, and archives); that is, the
attributes identified by informants that led to a
match with the creative prototypes all included the
word “passionate,” whereas for the uncreative prototypes, the word was not mentioned. These findings suggest that passion plays an important role in

“Social competence” refers to an individual’s overall
effectiveness in interacting with others in face-to-face
contexts and includes skills such as the ability to perceive others accurately, make a good first impression,
and persuade others to change views or behavior.

investment decisions for ventures that capitalize on
innovativeness and creativity.
We speculate that the judgments about passion
represented in Elsbach and Kramer’s (2003) data
were based on information from two sources: the
nonverbal cues a pitcher displayed (affective), and
the content of the script being pitched itself (cognitive). A well-written script with a thoughtful plot
and unexpected yet reasonable ending reveals the
time, effort, and resources the author has invested,
or how prepared he is. Thus, how well prepared
one is is as important as how enthusiastic one is in
predicting whether a script will be successful or
not. Similarly, the quality of a business plan should
reflect the cognitive preparedness of the entrepreneur who offers it—that is, whether he or she
would be ready to take the proposed venture forward if resources were provided. In this regard, the
business plan serves as an important indicator of a
venture’s potential for success.
The extant entrepreneurship literature does little
to inform us about how entrepreneur passion influences VCs’ decision-making process as it occurs in
the context of business plan presentations. Although it is widely acknowledged in the popular
press and in entrepreneurship circles that displaying passion is essential in acquiring funding for
new ventures, there is little empirical research
demonstrating such a phenomenon or exploring its
theoretical underpinnings. It is this gap that we
attempt to address in our study.

VENTURE INVESTMENT DECISION MAKING
AS A PERSUASION PROCESS
How do venture capitalists evaluate whether a
business plan is worth investing in? Social judgment research and persuasion research offer potential insights. Persuasion involves attitude formation and change in a recipient (e.g., a VC) as a result
of exposure to information associated with an appeal (e.g., the business plan presentation).3 We
view the making of VCs’ funding decisions as a
persuasion process, whereby entrepreneurs convince VCs of the merits of the entrepreneurs’ proposed ventures.

3

In real VC investments, the persuasion outcome is a
result of aggregating the outcomes of small moments of
persuasion (from, for example, the past five meetings
with the entrepreneurs or several visits to the company).
However, in the context of our study—the business plan
presentation and go/no-go decisions—the persuasion
models apply.

February

The Unimodel and VC Decision Making
To explicate this process, we adopt the unimodel
of persuasion (Kruglanski & Thompson, 1999a,
1999b) from social psychology, for it offers a new
conceptualization of persuasion. Although the unimodel differs from other established paradigms
of attitude change, such as dual-process models
(Crano & Prislin, 2006; Forgas, Williams, & Von
Hippel, 2003), it has received greater recognition
and acceptance in the literature in recent years
(e.g., Kruglanski, Chen, Pierro, Mannetti, Erb, &
Spiegel, 2006; Kruglanski, Chun, Erb, Pierro, Mannetti, & Spiegel, 2003; Pierro, Mannetti, Kruglanski,
& Sleeth-Keppler, 2004).
In contrast to the dominant dual-process approaches (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989; Petty
& Caciopo, 1986) discussed in the literature, the
unimodel does not rely on the assumption of two
qualitatively different routes to information processing. On the contrary, its assumption is that the
processing of issue-relevant information (the content of a message) and issue-irrelevant information
(cues other than the message itself) share the same
route and that there is only a quantitative difference between processing these two types of information (Erb, Pierro, Mannetti, Spiegel, & Kruglanski, 2004; Kruglanski et al., 2003).4 In other words,
according to the unimodel of persuasion, there is
“functional equivalence between cues/heuristics
and messages/arguments in persuasion” (Kruglanski et al., 2006: 108). The unimodel also asserts that
both motivation and cognitive ability come into
play (as in dual-process approaches to understanding persuasion) to determine how the receiver processes information (exerting more versus less effort). This conceptualization suggests that
persuasion outcome is determined by what receivers believe to be the basis for their judgment (e.g.,
“An expert has more valid claims” or “My belief
about social justice is the standard for evaluating
the validity of arguments”) and, therefore, what
qualifies as relevant evidence for consideration.
This conceptual distinction between the dual-

4

The unimodel has not addressed neurological differences in processing different types of information. It is
conceivable that there exist differences in processing information that is affect-laden (e.g., nonverbal cues) versus information that requires only cognitive analysis in
terms of the different brain centers that are activated.
However, the unimodel seems to imply that regardless of
the physiological differences in processing, “cues” and
“arguments” are ruled by the same laws when it comes to
having an impact on the persuasion outcomes (cf.
Brewer, 2003).

<-----Page 4----->2009

Chen, Yao, and Kotha

process models and the unimodel addresses the
subjectivity of what information qualifies as “evidence” for a persuasion-based conclusion. The
unimodel disregards the so-called qualitative differences in information received. In the VC decision context, whether or not passion (affective)
and/or preparedness (cognitive) are considered
relevant will depend on a VC’s implicit mental
model about these two pieces of information. On
the one hand, if a VC does not have the passionventure success relationship in mind, information about how passionate an entrepreneur is will
be irrelevant to the investment funding decision.
On the other hand, if a VC strongly believes that
the display of passion is crucial for the entrepreneur to be successful, then passion becomes
highly relevant in the VC’s decision making
about funding. As a result, we believe that the
unimodel explains the VC decision-making process better than the dual-process model because
it parsimoniously captures the persuasion process in business plan presentation.

Manifestation and Perception of Passion and
Preparedness in Presentations
VC firms receive numerous business plans every
year and are often cautious about making investment decisions (Bhidé, 2000). The typical VC investment decision tends to be nonroutine, complex, and challenging because of the market and
technical, financial, and personal uncertainties involved in proposed ventures. Hence, VCs routinely
elaborate due diligence to accumulate as much data
as possible to assess proposed ventures. Clearly,
one important aspect of this due diligence process
is listening to an entrepreneur’s business plan presentation and assessing his or her passion and preparedness in such a context.
Passionate entrepreneurs are those who show
strong and positive emotions toward their projects,
who cannot stop thinking and talking about their
ideas, and who are busy mobilizing resources to
turn their ideas into reality. Thus, observers of passion draw inferences about it from the affective,
cognitive, and behavioral signs the entrepreneur
displays. To VCs in a natural field setting, entrepreneurs’ passion is observable to the extent that
they display emotions (affective manifestation of
the construct) and present evidence for the thinking they have done (cognitive manifestation of the
construct) and the actions they have taken (behavioral manifestation of the construct). In the context
of a business plan presentation, the judges cannot
observe actions beyond that of the presentation, so

203

in our study we were unable to include the behavioral manifestation of passion.
The affective manifestation of passion for entrepreneurs who present business plans can include
both verbal (as in the use of words that indicate
one’s emotional state, such as “I am very excited
about the opportunity we have”) and nonverbal (as
in the use of facial expressions and body language,
such as a smile) expressions. In this study, we only
examined nonverbal cues related to the emotional
display of passion.
Evidence for thorough preparation in refining a
business idea (cognitive manifestation of the passion construct) is reflected in the quality of the
business plan being presented to VCs: the entrepreneur’s careful consideration of market needs, the
product or service that can meet such needs, the
market segments with the greatest potential for demand, competition from current or potential rivals,
the expected financial return from pursuing the
venture, and the difficulties the entrepreneur may
encounter as the venture unfolds. It is also reflected
in the way the entrepreneur tackles and responds to
questions from the VCs at the end of the business
plan presentation—whether the entrepreneur has
well-thought-out answers and creative solutions for
any concerns raised during the presentation.
The theoretical arguments, anecdotes, and research reviewed earlier suggest that both passion
(affective) and preparedness (cognitive) are likely
to be considered relevant information in VCs’ judgment of whether a proposed venture is worth
funding. Therefore, we propose:
Hypothesis 1. In a business plan presentation,
a VC’s perception of an entrepreneur’s passion
has a significant, positive effect on the VC’s
decision to invest.
Hypothesis 2. In a business plan presentation,
a VC’s perception of an entrepreneur’s preparedness has a significant, positive effect on
the VC’s decision to invest.
METHODS
Overview
We used multiple methods to test our hypotheses. Given the paucity of the research on entrepreneurial passion, we began by using a qualitative approach to develop a perceived passion and
preparedness scale, which we subsequently refined in two studies. In Study 1, we conducted a
laboratory experiment and examined the hypotheses by manipulating the content of a business
plan and the amount of passion exhibited by its

<-----Page 5----->204

presenter. In Study 2, we tested our hypotheses
in a field setting at a university’s annual business
plan competition to examine the generalizability
of our findings.

We developed a scale to measure VCs’ perception
of entrepreneurs’ passion and preparedness based
on entrepreneurs’ business plan presentations. We
adopted an inductive, qualitative, and multistage
approach to developing the scale. First, we administered an open-ended survey to 51 business executives, professors, doctoral students, and MBA students. We asked these respondents to draw from
their experience and indicate the nonverbal cues
and behavioral indicators that would make them
think that a presenter or speaker was passionate
about her or his work. The number of statements
respondents provided ranged from 1 to 8, with an
average of 4.7. The respondents provided a total of
239 statements.
Next, the first two authors independently sorted
the statements into categories and found high consistency between their sortings (r ⫽ .92). The few
remaining discrepancies were thoroughly discussed and a final consensus was reached whereby
all the statements were put into six categories. We
then chose the most frequently mentioned or typical items from each category to form the initial
“perceived passion” scale, which included 22
items.
We then tested the construct validity of these 22
items by asking 224 undergraduate, MBA, and doctoral students to evaluate videotaped or live presentations. We conducted an exploratory factor
analysis that led to a five-factor solution explaining
73 percent of the total variance. We dropped the 3
items that had high cross-factor loadings from further analyses. The remaining 19 items had loadings
higher than .65 on their corresponding factors. We
administered this 19-item measure in Study 1 (a
laboratory experiment), in which 126 people
participated.
Using the data collected from Study 1, we conducted another exploratory factor analysis. This
analysis revealed a two-factor solution explaining
68 percent of the total variance in the sample. In
this analysis, we found 8 items with high crossfactor loadings and dropped them from further
analyses. The remaining 11 items had loadings
higher than .60 on their corresponding latent factors (see Table 1). The items that load on factor 1
(the presenter had energetic body movements, displayed rich body language, was animated, showed
facial emotion, used gestures, and modulated his or

voice) reflect the perception of affective passion.
This factor explains about 52 percent of the variance, and the alpha reliability for this six-item subscale is .95. Items that load on factor 2 (the presentation was thoughtful and reflected depth of
understanding, had substance, reflected the
broader context, was coherent and logical, and was
supported by facts cited) reflect the perception of
preparedness (cognitive passion). This factor explains an additional 21 percent of the variance,
and the alpha reliability for this five-item subscale is .87.
To determine the construct validity of the twofactor model of the 11-item perceived passion and
preparedness scale, we performed a confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) using the data from 55 judges
in a business plan competition at the authors’ university (Study 2 is explained in detail below). This
analysis, for which we used EQS (Bentler & Weeks,
1979, 1980) revealed an adequate overall fit for the
two-factor model (␹2 ⫽ 106.31, df ⫽ 43, p ⬍ .00,

(␹2 ⫽ 547.59, df ⫽ 44, p ⬍ .00, CFI ⫽ .66, NFI ⫽ .64,

indicate that the two-factor model better fits our
data (⌬ខ ␹2 ⫽ 441.29, df ⫽ 1, p ⬍ .00). The correlation between these two subscales is moderate in
both studies (r ⫽ .39, p ⬍ .01, Study 1; r ⫽ .46, p ⬍
.01, Study 2), suggesting that passion and cognitive
preparedness are distinct but related constructs.
These results support our conceptualization of entrepreneur passion as including two distinct components in the business plan presentation context.

STUDY 1: LABORATORY EXPERIMENT
Participants, Design, and Procedures
Participants in this study included 126 executive
MBA (EMBA) and MBA students who took the
corporate entrepreneurship course at a large public
university in the United States, where two of the
authors were faculty members. All students volunteered to participate in the study. The average age
of the participants was 37.10 (s.d. ⫽ 7.30), with an
average of 14.30 years of working experience
(s.d. ⫽ 7.90). Seventy percent were male, 21.6 percent had a four-year undergraduate degree, 76 percent had a master’s degree, and 5 percent had a
doctoral degree. Moreover, 75 percent of participants had taken public speaking lessons.
The experimental design was a two (high or low
passion) by two (high- or medium-quality business
plan) factorial, resulting in four experimental conditions. To choose the appropriate business plans
to use, we examined those that had been entered in
the previous year’s business plan competition at
the same public university. After many rounds of
deliberation, we selected the business plan that
was ranked 1st out of the 16 in the semifinal round
of the competition and the plan that was ranked
8th. The 16 semifinalists were selected from an
initial submission pool of 64 plans during 2004.
The 1st-ranked plan represented a high-quality biotechnology venture, and the 8th-ranked plan was a
medium-quality venture proposing a financial magazine for teenagers.
We first constructed written executive summaries of these two plans for our experiment participants and then recruited a professional actor to
produce four videos that corresponded to the four
experimental conditions: a medium-quality business plan presented with or without great passion,
and a high-quality business plan presented with or
without great passion. The actor was asked to show
affective passion (or not, depending on the experimental condition), but to keep the content (the
words used to describe the business plan) exactly

205

the same for the respective business plans. The
experiment’s purpose was to examine the impact of
passion and preparedness on funding decisions.
Several rehearsals were conducted before the final
video was shot. All four experimental condition
videos lasted for eight minutes.
We randomly chose one of the four experimental
condition videos to be presented to a group of
EMBA or MBA students in classrooms equipped
with audiovisual facilities. They were told to roleplay VCs and make a funding decision for the business plan they saw on video. We first gave them the
business plan’s written executive summary and
asked them to read and consider investing in the
proposed venture for ten minutes. We then showed
them the entrepreneur’s presentation of the business plan in the video and asked them to fill out a
questionnaire evaluating the entrepreneur’s passion and preparedness on a five-point scale (1, “not
at all,” to 5, “frequently”), make an investment
decision (i.e., “yes” or “no”), provide reasons for
their decision, and answer a few demographic
questions. After the questionnaires were collected,
the participants were debriefed and the session was
concluded.
Variables
Reasons for investment decision. We listed five
reasons for a funding decision: (1) the business
model made sense, (2) the product was creative, (3)
the entrepreneur was enthusiastic and the management team members had strong backgrounds (the
executive summary of the business plans described
team backgrounds), (4) there was an attractive market for the product, and (5) the business idea was
profitable. Participants were asked to check all reasons that applied and were encouraged to list any
other reasons not provided on the list.
Demographic variables. Given that few studies
have examined the effects of venture capitalists’
individual differences on their decision making,
we started with those variables that might have an
impact, such as age, sex, years of work experience,
education level, and whether the participant had
taken a public speaking lesson, since this experience could have an impact on how he or she
viewed the business plan presentation.
Results
Manipulation check. To ensure the effectiveness
of the passion manipulation, we calculated participants’ evaluation on the affective passion subscale
and conducted a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The results showed that the participants

in the high-passion condition perceived more passion (mean ⫽ 3.65) than those in the low-passion
condition (mean ⫽ 1.78; F1, 121 ⫽ 158.45, p ⬍ .001).
These results suggest that the actor was successful
in controlling the nonverbal cues (i.e., body movement, facial expression, tone of voice) displayed
during the presentation. These results confirm that
our manipulation of passion was effective in inducing participants’ perception of passion.
To ensure the effectiveness of the business plan
quality manipulation, we used participants’ evaluation on the preparedness subscale and conducted
a one-way ANOVA. The results showed that the
participants in the high-quality condition gave
significantly higher scores (mean ⫽ 3.67) than
those in the medium-quality condition (mean ⫽
3.36; F1, 121 ⫽ 10.60, p ⬍ .01). These results confirm
that our choice of business plans of different quality level effectively generated different perceptions
of preparedness in the participants.
To examine whether the entrepreneur/management team factor was of primary concern to the
participants in their investment decision making,
we calculated the frequencies with which the participants chose the five reasons. As predicted, reason 3 (the entrepreneur was enthusiastic and the
management team members had strong backgrounds), given by 69 percent of the participants,
was the most frequent; it was followed by reason 1
(the business model made sense), given by 58 percent; reason 2 (the product was creative), 47 percent; reason 5 (the business idea was profitable), 41
percent; and reason 4 (there was an attractive market for the product), 40 percent. These results are
consistent with findings from previous research
(e.g., MacMillan, Siegel, & Narasimha, 1985; Tyeb-

jee & Bruno, 1981, 1984), indicating the importance
of the entrepreneur and management team as the
focal point of the investment decision regarding a
new venture.
Hypothesis testing. Table 2 presents the correlations between the variables of interest. Because the
dependent variable of our study—investment decision—was dichotomous, we used logistic hierarchical regression analyses to test the general hypothesis that VCs’ perceptions of the passion of a
presenter would significantly influence their funding decisions. Three out of the 126 Study 1 participants did not make investment decisions, and an
additional 2 participants did not provide information on whether they had taken public speaking
lessons, so we dropped these five cases from the
final analysis, resulting in 121 valid data points.
We entered all of the demographic variables in step
1, the two manipulated variables (i.e., the nonverbal display of passion and the business plan’s quality) and their interaction term in step 2, and then in
step 3 we entered the perceived passion and preparedness variables. Table 3 presents the results.
The results in Table 3 indicate that after the
effects of the demographic variables were controlled for, the experimental manipulation explained a significant amount of variance in participants’ investment decision (⌬R2 ⫽ 16%, p ⬍ .01),
with a significant, positive effect from the quality of
the business plan (␤ ⫽ 2.13, p ⬍ .01). More importantly, we found that neither the main effect of the
passion manipulation nor its interaction with business plan quality was significant at the .05 level,
suggesting that passion might not have the predicted effect.
Of greater interest, we examined the extent to

which perceived passion and preparedness had
positive effects on participants’ funding decisions.
Results in model 3 of Table 3 reveal that perceived
passion and preparedness together explain a significant amount of additional variance in investment
decisions (⌬R2 ⫽ 18%, p ⬍ .05), which supports
our general hypothesis. However, a closer examination of Table 3 indicates that it is preparedness
(␤ ⫽ 1.65, p ⬍ .01) that exerts a significant effect on
funding decisions, whereas the effect of passion is
not significant at the .05 level. These results provide support for Hypothesis 2, but not for Hypothesis 1. Taking these results together, we infer that
the quality of the business plan presented (manipulated through the verbal content of the video presentation and the business plan executive summary) induced investors’ perceptions of the
presenter’s preparedness, which in turn influenced
their funding decisions.
Additional analysis. Our results led us to speculate that preparedness might have played a mediating role. To test this speculation, we conducted a
three-step regression analysis, following Baron and
Kenny (1986). In step 1, we ran two regression
models to examine whether business plan quality
had a significant effect on (1) the investment decisions and (2) preparedness. In step 2, investment
decision was regressed on preparedness. Mediation
was only possible if the step 1 and step 2 regression
models yielded significant results for the predic-

tors. In step 3, business plan quality and preparedness were entered simultaneously as predictors of
investment decision. If both effects remained significant, then preparedness was a partial mediator.
If the effect of preparedness remained significant
while the effect of plan quality was no longer significant, then preparedness was a full mediator.
However, if the finding was the other way around,
then perceived preparedness was not a mediator
(Baron & Kenny, 1986). In all regressions, we included the same set of control variables as in the
previous logistic regression.
This additional analysis confirmed our speculation. We found that (1) the quality of the business
plan had significant effects on perceived preparedness (␤ ⫽ 0.50, p ⬍ .01) and funding decisions (␤ ⫽
1.47, p ⬍ .05); (2) perceived preparedness had a
significant effect on funding decisions (␤ ⫽ 0.54,
p ⬍ .05); and (3) when both variables were entered
simultaneously, both effects remained significant
(␤ ⫽ 2.46 and ␤ ⫽ 1.45, p ⬍ .01). These results
suggest that preparedness is a partial mediator of
the relationship between business plan quality and
VCs’ funding decisions.
Since affective passion did not have a significant
effect on funding decisions, even though the passion manipulation had a significant influence on
perceived passion, it did not qualify as a mediator
of the relationship between passion manipulation
and funding decision.

STUDY 2: FIELD STUDY
Participants and Procedures
Next, to examine the generalizability of these
findings, we conducted a field study to see whether
they could be replicated in a setting in which neither the quality of business plan nor the emotional
display of passion was manipulated. We collected
field study data over two consecutive years of the
university’s annual business plan competition. We
chose to focus on the stage of the business plan
competition at which initial screening had been
completed. The venture plans entering this stage
had great promise for obtaining outside funding.
Study participants included 55 investors who were
invited to serve as competition judges. The judges
came from VC firms, banks, and financial companies in the metropolitan area where the university
was located. The average age of this sample was
46.50 years old (s.d. ⫽ 7.90), and the average work
experience was 23.10 years (s.d. ⫽ 7.10). Eightytwo percent of the sample members were male; 69
percent had a master’s degree or MBA; and 18
percent had a doctoral degree. About 81 percent of
them had taken public speaking lessons. The sample was highly educated and experienced in funding entrepreneurial ventures.
A total of 31 business plans (including teams
from both years) entered the semifinal round of the
competition and were divided into eight panels. As
part of the business plan competition, eight panels
of judges (with six or seven judges in each panel)
were formed. All panels, except one, evaluated four
business plan presentations; the one exceptional
panel consisted of six judges who evaluated three
presentations. The potential number of total observations was 206.
All judges received the written business plans a
week before the presentations. Each team was given

15 minutes to present their business plan, followed
by a 10-minute question-and-answer session. Following a presentation, the judges were asked to
evaluate it in terms of: (1) the passion shown by the
main presenter in the presentation, (2) the preparedness demonstrated through the presentation,
and (3) whether or not the VCs intended to invest.
Judges independently filled out the evaluation
forms immediately after each presentation. At the
end of all the presentations, each panel deliberated
and recommended one business plan out of the
plans reviewed to advance to the final round of the
competition. However, because the time between
presentations was short, some judges were not able
to make a decision for some plans, and others did
not complete all of the items in the evaluation form.
Therefore, instead of having 206 observations, only
159 complete evaluations were available for data
analysis.
Measures
Passion and preparedness. The 11-item scale
from Study 1 was used to measure judges’ perception of the presenters’ passion and preparedness.
The alpha reliability for the passion scale was .94,
and the alpha reliability for the preparedness scale
was .90. These reliability measures are similar to
the ones obtained in Study 1.
Demographic variables. We again included the
judges’ age, sex, education level, work experience,
and history of taking public speaking lessons as
control variables.
Results

hypotheses. Since we were interested in the individual-level relationship between perceived passion and funding decision, even though each judge
evaluated four business plans, we treated each
evaluation as an independent observation. We entered the judge’s demographic variables (age, sex,
education, public speaking lessons, and work experience) in step 1. Because the business plan in
the competition was not manipulated, we coded it
as a dummy variable and also entered it as a control
variable at this stage (each plan was given a random
number). In step 2, we entered the two key variables—perceived passion and preparedness. Table
5 presents the results of this analysis.
Findings from Study 2 were consistent with results from Study 1; we found that overall perceived
passion and preparedness explained a significant
amount of unique variance in judges’ investment
decisions (⌬R2 ⫽ 24%, p ⬍ .001). These results
provide considerable support for our broad hypothesis that VCs’ perceptions of entrepreneur passion
and preparedness positively impact their investment-funding decisions.
A closer examination of Table 5 indicates that the
explained unique variance came mainly from preparedness (␤ ⫽ 1.69, p ⬍ .01). As in Study 1’s
results, the effect of passion is not statistically significant (␤ ⫽ ⫺0.09, n.s.). These findings support
Hypothesis 2 but not Hypothesis 1. They suggest

209

that with our experienced judges, it was the perceived preparedness rather than the passion of the
presenter(s) that significantly influenced their investment decisions.
Additional analysis. To further examine the mediating role of perceived preparedness in the business plan quality–funding decision relationship,
we used the panel funding decision as an indication of business plan quality. That is, we coded the
business plan that was chosen by each panel to
advance to the final round as having a higher quality (coded 1) than those not chosen (coded 0). We
then conducted a three-step regression analysis
(Baron & Kenny, 1986) to test the mediation effect.
Consistently with the results from Study 1, we
found that (1) the quality of a business plan had
significant effects on perceived preparedness (␤ ⫽
0.65, p ⬍ .01) and the judges’ funding decision (␤ ⫽
2.16, p ⬍ .01); (2) perceived preparedness had a
significant effect on the judges’ funding decision
(␤ ⫽ 1.97, p ⬍ .01); and (3) when both the quality of
a business plan and perceived preparedness were
entered simultaneously, the effects of both variables remained significant (␤ ⫽ 1.71 and 1.83, respectively, p ⬍ .01). These results again suggest
that perceived preparedness was a partial mediator
between business plan quality and the judges’
funding decisions.
In sum, results from both Studies 1 and 2 provide
strong support for Hypothesis 2 but not for
Hypothesis 1.

DISCUSSION
This study systematically investigated the role
passion and preparedness played in VCs’ investment decision making. The results support our conceptualization that in the context of business plan
presentations, the passion construct has two distinct but related components—passion and preparedness. Passion is manifested through facial expressions, body movement, tone of voice, and other
nonverbal cues, whereas preparedness is manifested in the verbal content and substance of a
presentation.

Passion and Preparedness: Counterintuitive,
Contrasting Effects
In the two studies we conducted, we found preparedness to be positively related to the VC funding
decision, whereas the effects of perceived passion
were statistically insignificant. We also found that
preparedness partially mediated the relationship
between business plan quality and the funding de-

<-----Page 11----->210

cision. According to the unimodel of persuasion
employed to ground our theoretical arguments, preparedness information is more relevant than the
information on passion in a VC’s mind. These findings are both counterintuitive and intriguing. The
findings are counterintuitive because the affective
aspect is what comes to people’s mind when “passion” is mentioned; however, we found no significant effects of this variable on VCs’ decisions about
funding new ventures. In contrast, the VCs in our
study were more receptive to cognition-based preparedness. They tended to focus on their perceptions of how prepared an entrepreneur was as a
way of “feeling” the entrepreneur’s passion for his
or her venture. In other words, the results are more
nuanced than our general understanding of passion
as used in ordinary parlance.
However, these findings somewhat echo Baron’s
(1989) analysis of why some people are more successful than others in employing impression-management tactics to get favorable evaluations: they
appear more sincere and genuine than those who
are less successful. In other words, their ingratiation comes with “substance.” Along the same lines,
if an entrepreneur shows affective passion, yet her
or his business plan lacks substance, it is as if the
ingratiation is fake and manipulative, and thus unlikely to generate a positive effect. Several studies
conducted by Ferris, Treadway, and colleagues
(e.g., Ferris, Treadway, Perrewe, Brouer, Douglas, &
Lux, 2007; Treadway, Ferris, Duke, Adams, &
Thatcher, 2007) have demonstrated the importance
of “sincerity” as a necessary component of successful
political skills.
These findings are intriguing because, on the surface, they seem inconsistent with prior entrepreneurship research that indicates a positive relationship between passion (operationalized as intense
affect or emotional expressiveness) and firm- or
individual-level outcome variables such as venture
growth/success (Baum et al., 2001) and entrepreneur financial success (Baron & Markman, 2000,
2003; Spence et al., 1999). However, our study differs significantly from the extant studies highlighted above in terms of the context studied and
the outcome variable examined. It is conceivable
that passion may be important in sustaining an
entrepreneur’s motivation in making a venture successful over the long term (i.e., growth) (Baum et
al., 2001). However, it appears that neither the investors who played the role of VCs nor the actual
VCs in our study considered it relevant in making
their funding decisions, which in practice may not
be unusual. This story about the managing partner
of Northwest Venture Associates is illustrative: “He

February

[the managing partner] had the opportunity to be an
early investor in a small company called Starbucks.
He liked the passion of Howard Schultz but didn’t
understand how one would make money selling
coffee, so he didn’t invest” (Ouchi, 2004: c4). The
theme of this passage is not unlike our findings
here: it was the substance of Starbucks’ business
plan that seemed to have mattered to the man from
Northwest Venture Associates, and not the affective passion displayed by Mr. Schultz.
We can only speculate on other possible explanations as to why the effect of perceived passion
was statistically insignificant. First, compared to
the general population, the judges in the business
plan competition were highly educated, had significant investing experience, and had (for the most
part) taken public speaking lessons. As a result, it is
possible that they were more aware of the danger of
emphasizing emotional expression (displayed as
passion) as opposed to the substance of the business plans being presented to them. Second, the
entrepreneurs in the business plan competition
were also more experienced in presentation than
the general population. Since substantial financial
amounts were involved (i.e., $100,000 worth of financial awards in our setting), most entrepreneurs
in our field study had gone through two competitive rounds and one noncompetitive round of
coaching for presentation style before entering the
semifinal round of the competition. It is possible
that these earlier activities reduced the possible
variation in presentation styles that the judges
observed.
This suggests a final possibility, a restriction of
range in our data set. Perhaps in a randomly chosen
large sample of entrepreneurs making their investment pitches, one would observe a greater variation
in presentation styles (nonverbal cues) than was
available in a restricted setting such as ours. It is
likely that the role of passion may turn out to be
different from what we were able to uncover. All
these possibilities suggest that more research is
needed to understand the role of perceived passion
in the context of investment decisions.
Contributions
The present study makes several contributions to
the understanding of the VC investment decision
process. First, we developed perceived passion and
preparedness scales that help distinguish between
the affective and cognitive components involved in
preparing and presenting business plans. To our
knowledge, this is the first study that has developed such scales in a venture-funding context. Second, this is one of the few studies that empirically

<-----Page 12----->2009

Chen, Yao, and Kotha

links derived passion and preparedness constructs
to VC investment decisions. As a result of the multiple approaches (qualitative, experimental, and
field studies) we employed to validate and test our
proposed passion construct, our study is theoretically grounded and empirically rigorous.
Third, our conceptualization of the VC funding
decision as a persuasion process provides a useful
perspective from which to study the interpersonal
dynamics between VCs and entrepreneurs. It reveals the underlying mechanisms involved in this
often “mysterious” new venture investment decision. Fourth, our use of the unimodel of persuasion
to explain the role of passion and preparedness in
the VC funding decision represents the application
of a rigorous theoretical model in social psychology
literature to a novel setting. The differential impacts on our outcome variable that we found for
passion and preparedness help to establish a tentative theoretical foundation for further study of the
passion construct in situations in which the social
and interpersonal aspects of persuasion matter. For
example, the perceived passion and preparedness
scales developed for this study may have the potential to transcend the VC-entrepreneur setting
and apply to a wide variety of selection contexts
that involve live presentations, such as job talks in
academic settings, project report presentations in
corporate settings, and role auditions in the entertainment business.
Finally, our theory-driven approach to studying
the effects of passion and preparedness in the context of entrepreneur-VC dynamics extends previous
research on VC decision making in both scope and
depth. Researchers conducting past VC funding
studies have either run experiments in which simplified business plans are assessed, without the
entrepreneur(s) behind the plans making a case for
them (Shepherd, 1999), or they have asked participants to highlight the criteria they use to assess
new venture business plans (e.g., Hall & Hofer,
1993; Hisrich & Jankowicz, 1990). In contrast, our
study participants were exposed to extensive details about the business plans and were able to
interact with the entrepreneurs (and entire venture
teams) in vivo. Thus, our setting enabled us to
capture investors’ subjective interpretation of information about the process, whether it related to the
plan or to the person, thereby circumventing the
biases that could have resulted from the post hoc
self-reported assessments found in earlier studies.
Limitations
Although our initial results are promising, we
recognize several limitations. The experimental

211

setting for Study 1 was artificial. Further, the business plan competition, although real in terms of the
financial rewards, is a very specialized setting for
studying the passion construct. These two conditions could limit our findings’ generalizability.
Hence, more research is needed to examine passion
versus preparedness in impacting business decisions in other domains such as job interviewing,
hiring, promotion, and performance appraisal.
In our approach, we did not directly examine
behaviors that accompany the display of passion.
In reality, investors such as VCs and entrepreneurs
often interact with each other on more than one
occasion, and VCs get opportunities to observe entrepreneurs in different contexts. We suspect that
VCs would perceive repeated behaviors as more
telling of internal passion than a one-time presentation, because repeated behaviors might reflect a
deeper level of involvement and commitment to a
proposed venture. Hence, more research is needed
to examine how the behavioral component of passion influences VCs’ judgment in contexts in which
entrepreneurs and VCs interact more extensively.
Given our conceptualization of passion and preparedness in VC investment decisions, we limited
our efforts to examining just a simple mediation
effect of preparedness on the relationship between
the quality of a business plan and a judge’s funding
decision. Future research should expand our model
to include more variables for examining moderating and mediating effects. For example, an entrepreneur’s qualifications and prior track record in
venturing, the innovativeness of a proposed business plan, the industry in which the proposed venture belongs, and the degree of marketing or technical uncertainty pertaining to the proposed
venture may all be important moderating variables.
On the VC side, prior successful investing experience, preference (or bias) toward certain types of
business plans, and personal preference for certain
entrepreneur characteristics may also be important
moderating variables in the persuasion process.
In this study, we focused solely on the communication of one’s internal experience of passion
through nonverbal and verbal cues. The perceived
passion and preparedness scale only captures what
the perceiver thinks to be signs of a passionate
presenter. Our study therefore lends further support to Baron and colleagues’ (Baron & Markman,
2000, 2003; Baron & Tang, in press) findings that
expressiveness, or the ability to communicate one’s
emotions, affects the financial performance of one’s
venture. In reality, however, passion is more than
just expressed and perceived emotions. Entrepreneurs’ subjective experiences and corresponding
cognitions and actions might be quite different and

<-----Page 13----->212

far richer than what outsiders can observe. Thus,
future research should look beyond perceived passion and preparedness to articulate the passion
construct and should explore the measurement of
internally experienced passion, its antecedents,
and its consequences. More research is also needed
on whether experienced and exhibited passions
predict different outcomes (e.g., immediate funding
decision or future success), and on the different
mechanisms underlying such relationships.
Implications
The findings of our study may help entrepreneurs increase the likelihood of their obtaining
funding. New-product champions, “intrapreneurs,” entrepreneurs, and nonprofit enthusiasts
will be more effective if they are better prepared in
delivering their ideas or plans. Specifically, those
who have accurate and detailed knowledge about
their proposals and who display a thorough understanding of the opportunities and challenges they
face are in a better position to receive investment
funding.
Some might argue that all the objective criteria
earlier research has included (e.g., market opportunities, competition, and strategies) already address
the issue of preparedness. However, our results
suggest that perceived preparedness might be the
“missing link” between a set of objective criteria
VCs may or may not use in their investment decisions. They show that effective presentation of content is just as important as the content itself. Thus,
our advice for entrepreneurs is this: If you are passionate about your business idea, do your homework and do it well; then go out and let the potential investors know that you are prepared and
poised!
In summary, we believe that this study makes an
important contribution to the entrepreneurship literature. It suggests that preparedness is one of the
most salient cues VCs consider relevant in judging
whether a business plan is worth funding or not,
and that passion is a construct that scholars need to
study more systematically. As W. Eugene Smith, a
world-renowned photojournalist, once put it, “Passion is in all great searches and is necessary to all
creative endeavors” (http://www.smithfund.org/
aboutfund/overview). Further pursuit of the effects
of passion will, we hope, improve understanding of
the investment decision-making processes of VCs
and others.
