"Who Is an Entrepreneur?" Is
the Wrong Question
William B. Gartner
Entrepreneurship is the creation of organizations. What differentiates entrepreneurs
from non-entrepreneurs is that entrepreneurs create organizations, while non-entrepreneurs do not. In behavioral approaches to the study of entrepreneurship an entrepreneur is seen as a set of activities involved in organization creation, while in trait
approaches an entrepreneur is a set of personality traits and characteristics. This
paper argues that trait approaches have been unfruitful and that behavioral approaches will be a more productive perspective for future research in entrepreneurship.

My own personal experience was that for ten years we ran a research center
in entrepreneurial bistory, for ten years we tried to define the entrepreneur.
We never succeeded. Each of us had some notion of it—what he thought
was, for his purposes, a useful definition. And I don't think you're going to
get farther than that. (Cole, 1969, p. 17)
How can we know the dancer from the dance? {Yeats, 1956)
Arthur Cole's words have taken on the deeper tones of prophecy. Recent reviews of the entrepreneurship literature have found few changes in this dilemma
in the sixteen years since Cole's statement. Brockhuas and Horwitz's (1985)
review of the psychology of the entrepreneur concluded that "The literature appears to support the argument that there is no generic definition of the entrepreneur, or if there is we do not have the psychological instruments to discover it at
this time. Most of the attempts to distinguish between entrepreneurs and small
business owners or managers have discovered no significant differentiating features." (pp. 42-43) Other scholars have concurred that a common definition of
the entrepreneur remains elusive (Carsrud, 01m and Edy, 1985; Sexton and
Smilor, 1985; Wortman, 1985).
Cole's early doubts about whether the entrepreneur could be defined have not
stopped researchers from attempting to do so. Much research in the entrepreneurship field has focused on the person of the entrepreneur, asking the question,
Why do certain individuals start firms when others, under similar conditions, do
not? Asking why has led us to answering with who: Why did X start a venture?
Because X has a certain inner quality or qualities. This focus can be identified in
any research which seeks to identify traits that differentiate entrepreneurs from
non-entrepreneurs: need for achievement (Komives, 1972; McClelland, 1961;
McClelland and Winter, 1969), locus of control (Brockhaus, 1980a; Brockhaus

(Brockhaus, 1980b; Hull, Bosley, and Udell, 1982; Liles, 1974; Mancuso, 1975;
Palmer, 1971), values (DeCarlo and Lyons, 1979; Hornaday and Aboud, 1971;
Hull, Bosley, and Udell, 1980; Komives, 1972), age (Cooper, 1973; Howell,
1972; Mayer and Goldstein, 1961) are but a few examples. X starts a venture
because of qualities that made X who (s)he is. Entrepreneurship research has
long asked, "Who is an entrepreneur?"
I believe the attempt to answer the question "Who is an entrepreneur?,"
which focusses on the traits and personality characteristics of entrepreneurs, will
neither lead us to a definition of the entrepreneur nor help us to understand the
phenomenon of entrepreneurship. This search for characteristics and traits of the
entrepreneur is labeled in this article as the trait approach. In this approach the
entrepreneur is the basic unit of analysis and the entrepreneur's traits and characteristics are the key to explaining entrepreneurship as a phenomenon, since the
entrepreneur "causes" entrepreneurship. The purpose of the first part of this
article is to look at research based on the trait view of entrepreneurship and to
show that this view alone is inadequate to explain the phenomenon of entrepreneurship. Another approach is needed to help us refocus our thoughts on entrepreneurship. That approach—the behavioral approach—wilt be presented and
the two approaches will be compared and contrasted.

THE TRAIT APPROACH
In the trait approach the entrepreneur is assumed to be a particular personality
type, a fixed state of existence, a describable species that one might find a picture
of in a field guide, and the point of much entrepreneurship research has been to
enumerate a set of characteristics describing this entity known as the entrepreneur. One indication of the tenacity of this point of view—i.e., once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, since an entrepreneur is a personality type, a state
of being that doesn't go away—can be seen in the selection of samples of "entrepreneurs" in many well-regarded research studies (Table 1). In many studies
"entrepreneurs" are sampled many years after having started their firms. Hor"entrepreneurs" are sampled many years after having started their firms. Hornaday and Aboud (1971), for example, chose to study individuals who headed
neurs" were interviewed anywhere from two to sixteen years after startup. Is the
owner/manager of an ongoing firm two or ten or even fifteen years after startup
an entrepreneur? If this individual is included in a sample of entrepreneurs, what
does that imply about the researcher's definition of the entrepreneur, and what
will the resulting data reflect?
Tabte 1 is an attempt to organize concisely much of the major literature on the
entrepreneur and entrepreneurship. It represents a succumbing to the grand temptation that haunts many writers and researchers in the entrepreneurship field: if
we could just systematically go back and extract, categorize, and organize what
has already been discovered about the entrepreneur, we will return with the
pieces of a puzzle which we can then fit together into the big picture, and the
entrepreneur will appear defined on the page. Table 1 is most emphatically not
the big picture. Instead Table 1 shows;
(1) that many (and often vague) definitions of the entrepreneur have been used
(in many studies the entrepreneur is never defined);

<-----Page 10----->(2) there are few studies that employ the same definition;
(3) that lack of basic agreement as to "who an entrepreneur is" has led to the
selection of samples of "entrepreneurs" that are hardly homogeneous. This lack
of homogeneity occurs not only among the various samples listed, but actually
within single samples. For many of the samples it could be said that variation
within the sample is more significant, i.e., it could tell us more than variation
between the sample and the general population.
(4) that a startling number of traits and characteristics have been attributed to
the entrepreneur, and a "psychological profile" of the entrepreneur assembled
from these studies would portray someone larger than life, full of contradictions,
and, conversely, someone so full of traits that (s)he would have to be a sort of
generic "Everyman."

BEHAVIORAL AND TRAIT APPROACHES
TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP
I think the study of the entrepreneur is actually one step removed from the
primary phenomenon of entrepreneurship—the creation of organizations, the
process by which new organizations come into existence (Vesper, 1982). This
behavioral approach views the creation of an organization as a contextual event,
the outcome of many influences. The entrepreneur is part of the complex process
of new venture creation. This approach to the study of entrepreneurship treats the
organization as the primary level of analysis and the individual is viewed in terms
of activities undertaken to enable the organization to come into existence
(Gartner, 1985). The personality characteristics of the entrepreneur are ancillary
to the entrepreneur's behaviors. Research on the entrepreneur should focus on
what the entrepreneur does and not who the entrepreneur is.
This behavioral view of entrepreneurship is not new. Many authors have asked
as their primary question, "How does an organization come into existence?"
(Herbert & Link, 1982; Shapero & Sokol, 1982). Arthur Cole, for example,
taking a behavioral viewpoint, quoted Say (1816) and defined the entrepreneur as
an economic agent who;
unites all means of production—the labor of the one, the capital or the land
of the others—and who finds in the value of the products which result from
their employment the reconstitution of the entire capital that he utilizes, and
the value of the wages, the interest, and the rent which he pays, as well as the
profits belonging to himself (Cole, 1946, p. 3)
This view places the entrepreneur within the process of new venture creation,
performing a series of actions that result in the creation of an organization. However, after setting out admirably to define the entrepreneur according to a behavioral orientation. Cole immediately falls back to the "who is an entrepreneur"
approach, and we are once more with traits and characteristics:
This person, this entrepreneur, must have special personal qualities: . . .
(from Say) judgement, perseverance, and a knowledge of the world as well
as of business, (p. 3, emphasis added)

Spring, 1988

21

<-----Page 11----->Although the behavioral view of entrepreneurship is not new, it seems that it
has always been a difficult view to maintain (Peterson, 1981). As we have seen,
the entrepreneur has long seemed to many researchers to be a special person
whose qualities need to be investigated. In 1980 Van de Ven issued a warning to
entrepreneurship researchers not to be tempted into studies of traits and characteristics:
Researchers wedded to the conception of entrepreneurship for studying the
creation of organizations can leam much from the history of research on
leadership. Like the studies of entrepreneurship, this research began by investigating the traits and personality characteristics of leaders. However, no
empirical evidence was found to support the expectation that there are a finite
number of characteristics or traits of leaders and that these traits differentiate
successful from unsuccessful leaders. More recently, research into leadership
has apparently made some progress by focusing on the behavior of leaders
(that is, on what they do instead of what they are) and by determining what
situational factors or conditions moderate the effects of their behavior and
performance, (p. 86)
Jenks (1950) and Kilby (1971) have also strongly criticized research which seeks
to develop personality profiles of the entrepreneur; both have encouraged researchers to study the behaviors and activities of entrepreneurs. In empirical research (Brockhaus, 1980; Brockhaus & Nord, 1979; Sexton & Kent, 1981) have
found that when certain psychological traits are carefully evaluated, it is not
possible to differentiate entrepreneurs from managers or from the general population based on the entrepreneur's supposed possession of such traits.
The trait approach to entrepreneurship research is understandably persistent.
Entrepreneurs often do seem like special people who achieve things that most of
us do not achieve. These achievements, we think, must be based on some special
inner quality. It is difficult not to think this way. But let us try to step outside this
way of thinking. We can illustrate this point with a story. What if the United
States suddenly found itself unable to field a team of baseball players that could
win in world competition? One response to such a problem might be to do research on baseball players to leam "Who is a baseball player?," so that individuals with baseball playing propensity could be selected from the population.
Such studies might determine that, on average, baseball players weigh 185
pounds, are six feet tall, and most of them can bench press over 250 pounds. We
could probably develop a very good personality profile of the baseball player.
Based on upbringing and experience we could document a baseball player's locus
of control, need for achievement, tolerance of ambiguity, and other characteristics that we thought must make for good baseball playing. We could then recruit individuals with this set of characteristics and feel confident once again in
our competitive edge. Yet, this type of research simply ignores the obvious—
that is, the baseball player, in fact, plays baseball. Baseball involves a set of
behaviors—running, pitching, throwing, catching, hitting, sliding, etc.—that
baseball players exhibit. To be a baseball player means that an individual is
behaving as a baseball player. A baseball player is not something one is, it is
something one does, and the definition of a baseball player cannot stray far from
this obvious fact without getting into difficulty.
22

American Journal of Small Business

<-----Page 12----->This might be said about any occupation—manager, welder, doctor, butcher.
How can we know the baseball player from the game? How can we know the
entrepreneur from starting an organization?
While this baseball metaphor might help to make the difference between behavioral and trait viewpoints very clear and keep it clear, this clarity is not so
easily achieved in real life empirical research, and researchers' viewpoints become cloudy and out of focus. Behavioral and trait issues merge and conclusions
are vague and don't really tell us anything.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRAIT VIEWPOINT
An article by Carland, Hoy, Boulton and Carland (1984), "Differentiating
Entrepreneurs from Small Business Owners: A Conceptualization" is, I believe,
a good recent example of research which continues in the long tradition of "ifwe-can-just-find-out-who-the-entrepreneur-is-then-we'11-know-what-entrepreneurship-is." By singling out this article I do not mean to imply that it is any
better or worse than the myriad of other entrepreneurship articles that take the
trait approach. I have chosen it because it is the first review article on entrepreneurship to appear in a major journal since 1977, and after such a long hiatus, my
reaction was to focus hard on the offering.
As noted above, the centra! issue in trait approach research is to distinguish
entrepreneurs from other populations of individuals. And, indeed, the Carland, et
al. article begins by rearticulating the perpetual dilemma of entrepreneurship researchers:
If entrepreneurs exist as entities distinct from small and large organizations
and if entrepreneurial activity is a fundamental contributor to economic development, on what bases may entrepreneurs he separated from nonentrepreneurial managers in order for the phenomenon of entrepreneurship to be
studied and understood? (p. 355—emphasis added)
Carland, et al. do recognize that the owner/manager of the ten or fifteen-yearold firm is not necessarily engaged in entrepreneurship, and therefore these
"small business owners," as Carland et at. calls them, should not be included in
a sample of entrepreneurs. However, when it comes to distinguishing between
the entrepreneur and the small business owner, it can be shown that Carland et al.
are hindered by trait views, by focusing on the entrepreneur and who (s)he is as
the primary level of analysis. After a selective review of the literature, the paper
concludes with some definitions which attempt to distinguish the entrepreneur
from the small business owner:
Entrepreneur: An entrepreneur is an individual who establishes and manages
a business for the principal purposes of profit and growth. The entrepreneur
is characterized principally by innovative behavior and will employ strategic
management practices in the business.
Small business owner: A small business owner is an individual who establishes and manages a business for the principal purpose of furthering personal
goals. The business must be the primary source of income and will consume
the majority of one's time and resources. The owner perceives the business
Spring, 1988

23

<-----Page 13----->as an extension of his or her personality, intricately bound with family needs
and desires, (p. 358)
From the previous discussion, focusing on the intentionality of the individual
in order to determine whether that individual is an entrepreneur is just another
variation on the trait theme, and requires us to investigate the psychology of the
entrepreneur and establish a psychological profile of the entrepreneurial entity.
Furthermore, even if we take the definitions at face value, we are immediately
aware that the definitions raise more questions than they answer. If by definition
a small business owner establishes a business to further personal goals and an
entrepreneur establishes a business for profit and growth, then what do we do
with the individual whose personal goal is to establish a business for profit and
growth? (Are the goals of profit and growth to be considered impersonal goals?)
How do we distinguish personal goals from goals of profit and growth? Are we
not, then, embroiled in another dilemma of distinguishing? When you define
small business owners as having a business which is their primary source of
income and will consume the majority of their time, do you not thereby imply
that entrepreneurs start organizations that will nol be their primary source of
income, and will not occupy the majority of their time and resources? (Are we to
assume that the entrepreneurs are off spending the majority of their time pursuing
personal goals, which, by definition, cannot be related to their organizations?) If
small business owners perceive the business as an extension of their personalities, intricately bound with family needs and desires, as opposed to entrepreneurs who do not perceive their firms in this way, then isn't this definition of
small business likely to include such family run organizations as Marriott, Best,
and Nordstrom, leaders of their industries in both profits and growth? To suggest
that entrepreneurial startups are not intricately bound up with the personality of
the founders is to suggest that organizations such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard,
Lotus, and Microsoft are not entrepreneurial.
The last part of the Carland et al. entrepreneurial definition ties the state of
being an entrepreneur to innovative behavior and strategic management practices. Carland et al. use a Schumpeterian definition of innovative behavior (p.
357) which identifies five innovative strategic postures: (1) introduction of new
goods, (2) introduction of new methods of production, (3) opening of new
markets (4) opening of new sources of supply, and (5) industrial reorganization.
Correlating entrepreneurship with innovation, although it is intuitively appealing,
and seems to take more of a behavioral viewpoint, leads to the problem of identifying which firms in an industry are the innovative ones. Would the first entrant
in an industry be considered the entrepreneurial firm, while all subsequent entrants would be small businesses? How are we to determine the degree of difference between one product and another similar product which constitutes innovation? Do new methods of manufacturing/marketing/distributing the product count
as innovative, and, again, what is the degree of difference between the truly
innovative and the not so innovative? Among the fifty or so personal computer
manufacturing companies, e.g., Compaq, Columbia, Leading Edge, Intertec,
ACT Ltd., Polo Microsystems, Tava, Steams Computer, Wyse Technology, Microcraft. Electro Design, STM Electronics, MAD Computer, Seequa Computer,
GRiD Systems, Bytec-Comterm, Seattle Computer, Durango Systems. Otrona
Advance Systems, which are the innovators; which are the small businesses?
24

American Journal of Small Business

<-----Page 14----->Correlating innovation with entrepreneurship implies that almost all firms in an
industry which sell to similar customer groups would be considered small businesses. The Carland et al. definitions, while intending to achieve greater precision, actually increase the ambiguity in what is already a definitional dilemma.
Operationalizing these definitions—pinpointing who is an entrepreneur—becomes more and more difficult as Van de Ven (1980) warned.
Carland et al. discuss some past research studies in order to identify and list
many characteristics that have been attributed to entrepreneurs. As I mentioned
earlier, this is the grand temptation. Entrepreneurship research has reached such a
point of accumulation of data that the Carland et al. attempt to sort out past
research according to characteristics studied and to list these characteristics in a
table (Table 1: Characteristics of Entrepreneurs, p. 356) certainly might seem
like the most effective way to proceed in attempting to reach a definition of who
is an entrepreneur (although it is hoped that my own Table 1 has shown that such
a mega-table is not the answer). On setting up the table, however, it becomes
immediately clear, as Carland et al. admit, that the studies which investigated
these characteristics and attributed them to entrepreneurs were not all empirical,
and more importantly, as Carland et al. point out, the research samples were by
no means homogeneous. As discussed earlier, the authors of these past studies
usually did not provide important information regarding their samples; e.g., what
type of industry or type of firm was studied. The past studies usually made broad
generalizations in defining an entrepreneur, and the samples, therefore, included
executives, managers, salespersons, and small business persons. Onee Carland et
al. set up the table and recognize difficulties with it, we are left wondering about
the relevance of including Table 1 in a paper whose main purpose is to distinguish entrepreneurs from small business owners.' Carland et al. end the discussion of Table 1 with this question:
Are the characteristics listed in Table 1 those of entrepreneurs, of small business owners, or of some mixture that may or may not be capable of demonstrating the entrepreneurial function of economic development?
By ending the discussion in this way they view Table 1 as worthless. In the
Carland et al. attempt to distinguish the entrepreneur from the small business
owner do we come any closer to a definition of the entrepreneur or to an understanding of entrepreneurship? I hope I have shown the Carland et al. article is a
'Carland et al. attempt to make sense ofthe wide range of characteristics attributed to entrepreneurs
in their Table 1 by stating that Vesper's view (1980) (that several types of entrepreneurs exist) may
be an appropriate view, and by implying that different entrepreneurs may possess different characteristics, thus accounting for the wide range of them in their table. However, Carland et al, quickly
undercut Vesper's notion of entrepreneurial types by calling Vesper's typology "a continuum along
which several 'types' of entrepreneurs exist," and then insisting that the entrepreneurs along the
continuum differ, not merely by possesing different characteristics, but by displaying different
degrees of intensity of the set of characteristics which makes a person an entrepreneur. We are back
to making fine distinctions and measuring imponderables. Vesper's notion of entrepreneurial types
is reduced by Carland et al. to a caste system, with the most entrepreneurial entrepreneurs (the
purest types) at the furthest end of the continuum. This is another illustration of the extremes to
which the trait view may take us; the entrepreneur is an entity like an accordian file who can be
more full or less full of entrepreneurial "stuff."

<-----Page 15----->good example of where we end up when, with every good intention, we ask the
wrong question. Who is an entrepreneur? is the wrong question.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE CREATION
OF ORGANIZATIONS
Organization creation (Vesper, 1982), I believe, separates entrepreneurship
from other disciplines. Studies of psychological characteristics of entrepreneurs,
sociological explanations of entrepreneurial cultures, economic and demographic
explanations of entrepreneurial locations, etc., al! such investigations in the entrepreneurship field actually begin with the creation of new organizations. Entrepreneurship is the creation of new organizations. The purpose of this paper is not
to substitute one highly specific entrepreneurial definition for another. "Entrepreneurship is the creation of new organizations" is not offered as a definition,
but rather it is an attempt to change a long held and tenacious viewpoint in the
entrepreneurship field. If we are to understand the phenomenon of entrepreneurship in order to encourage its growth, then we need to focus on the process by
wbich new organizations are created. This may seem like a simple refinement of
focus (i.e., look at what the entrepreneur does, not who the entrepreneur is), but
it is actually a rather thoroughgoing change in our orientation. From this perspective, other issues in the field migbt be seen with new clarity.
An example of such an issue: if entrepreneurship is behavioral, then it can be
seen that these behaviors cease once organization creation is over. One of the
problems in the entrepreneurship field is deciding when entrepreneurship ends
(Vesper, 1980). (Actually, the Carland et al. attempt to distinguish entrepreneurs
from small business owners might be approached more fruitfully if looked at
from the behavioral perspective of entrepreneurship ending.) The organization
can live on past its creation stage to such possible stages as growth, maturity, or
decline (Greiner, 1972; Steinmetz. 1969). From the process viewpoint, the individual who creates the organization as the entrepreneur takes on other roles at
each stage—innovator, manager, small business owner, division vice-president,
etc. Entrepreneurs, like baseball players, are identified by a set of behaviors
which link them to organization creation. Managers, small business owners, etc.,
are also identified by their behaviors. As long as we adhere to the behavioral
approach and view entrepreneurship as something one does and not who one is,
then we can more effectively avoid the Carland et al.-type definitional dilemmas.
But once we are tempted to view the entrepreneur, the manager, the small business owner, etc., as states of being, we become embroiled in trying to pin down
their inner qualities and intentions. Tbis approach may not completely resolve the
question of when entrepreneurship ends, but it makes us look at the organization,
rather than the person, for our answer. Entrepreneurship ends when the creation
stage of the organization ends.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH ON THE ENTREPRENEUR
Reorientation toward a behavioral approach to entrepreneurship begins by
asking the primary question, "How do organizations come into existence?" We
should think of entrepreneurs in regard to the role they play in enabling organizations to come into existence (Jenks, 1950; Kilby, 1971; Peterson, 1981; Van de
26

American Journal of Small Business

<-----Page 16----->Ven, 1980). The focus will be on research questions that ask (among other
things) what individuals do to enable organizations to come into existence, rather
than on the traits and characteristics of these individuals.
Entrepreneurship research should follow the path of research taken in managerial behaviors (Mintzberg, 1973). The issues that Mintzberg articulated regarding
managers are tbe issues which also confront entrepreneurship. Substitute the
word entrepreneur for manager, and entrepreneurial for managerial in Mintzberg's statement of the purpose of his study:
We must be able to answer a number of specific questions before we can
expect managerial training and management science to have any real impact
on practice:
What kinds of activities does the manager perform? What kinds of information does he process? With who must he work? Where? How frequently?
What are the distinguishing characteristics of managerial work? What is of
interest about the media the manager uses, the activities he prefers to engage
in, the fiow of these activities during the workday, his use of time, the pressures of the job?
What basic roles can be inferred from tbe study of the manager's activities? What roles does the manager perform in moving information, in making
decisions, in dealing with people?
What variations exist among managerial jobs? To what extent can basic
differences be attributed to the situation, the incumbent, the job, the organization, and the environment?
To what extent is management a science? To what extent is the manager's
work programmed (that is, repetitive, systematic and predictable)? To what
extent is it programmable? To what extent can the management scientist "reprogram" managerial work? (Mintzberg, 1973: 3)
I believe that research on entrepreneurial behaviors must be based on field
work similar to Mintzberg's study of managerial work. Researchers must observe
entrepreneurs in the process of creating organizations. This work must be described in detail and the activities systematized and classified. Knowledge of
entrepreneurial behaviors is dependent on field work.
The results of this field work should also be able to answer additional questions. Wbat are the specific organization creation skills that an entrepreneur
needs to know? (Palmer, 1971) If we've given up the perspective that tells us that
an entrepreneur is bom with these skills and abilities, then we must ask how are
these skills acquired? Some research suggests that entrepreneurial skills are
"leam-as-you-go" (Collins & Moore, 1970; Gartner, 1984). Entrepreneurs who
have started one organization seem to be more successful and more efficient in
the startup of their second and third organizations (Vesper, 1980). If this is
usually true, then what expertise, what special knowledge do these entrepreneurs
gain from doing their first startup? One skill they might learn is how to identify
and evaluate problems. A new organization is confronted by many problems, and
some problems are more important tban others. It would seem that the more
successful entrepreneurs develop expertise in judging which problems need immediate attention (Hoad & Rosko, 1964; Lamont, 1972).
The process of team formation needs to be studied (Timmons, 1979). How and

<-----Page 17----->why do individuals enter a new venture? How do they claim ownership of a new
idea, organization, etc.? How is esprit de corps generated? How do individuals
convince themselves that entering a new organization wiil benefit them (Kidder,
1981)?
All new ventures need some type of support, e.g., financial, legal, marketing,
technological. This assistance can be obtained in many ways. In internal startups
the entrepreneur has to convince senior management to provide support (Schollhammer, 1982). What is the political process—the strategies—that the entrepreneur undertakes to gain internal assistance? Is this any different than the process
undertaken by independent entrepreneurs to persuade venture capitalists to invest
in their ventures? In either case, we need to make this process more efficient and
successful because it appears that few new venture plans gain support. The importance of business plans to the process of obtaining venture capital and support
needs to be studied (Roberts, 1983). What are the features of successful business
plans?

CONCLUSION
How do we know the dancer from the dance? When we view entrepreneurship
from a behavioral perspective we do not artifically separate dancer from dance,
we do not attempt to fashion a reassuring simplicity. The behavioral approach
challenges us to develop research questions, methodologies and techniques that
wilt do justice to the complexity of entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1985). The creation of an organization is a very complicated and intricate process, influenced
by many factors and influencing us even as we look at it. The entrepreneur is not
a fixed state of existence, rather entrepreneurship is a roie that individuals undertake to create organizations.
