Speed to Initial
Public Offering of
VC-Backed Companies
Dean A. Shepherd
Andrew Zacharakis
Venture capitalists realize returns on their investments when their portfolio companies
either go public (IPO) or are acquired by a publicly traded company. Finance theory implies
that the sooner a particular return can be realized the higher the real" return to the investor.
We use an ecosystem perspective to investigate speed to Initial Public Offering. Findings
indicate that geography of the portfolio company matters, that non high-tech portfolio companies go public faster than do those in the computer-related sector, and that speed is
increased with the recent favorable IPO market but not at the same rate for all regions.

M.ost of the research on venture capitalists" decision making has investigated how
venture capitalists (VCs) assess the future performance of a venture in terms of profitability (Robinson. 1987: Roure & Keeley. 1990). survival (Gorman & Sahlman. 1989;
Shepherd. 1999). and performance in general (Kahn. 1987; Zacharakis & Meyer. 1998).
The implicit assumption in these .studies is that VCs believe their tlnn's performance is
dependent upon the performance of its portfolio companies. This assumption appears
reasonable to the extent that there is likely to be a high correlation between the profitability of the portfolio company and the valuation of that venture at the time the VC
exits.' We argue that high valuations and subsequent high exit amounts provide an
incomplete picture of a V C s investment considerations.
Finance/economic theory proposes that time must also be a consideration for investors in order to obtain a clear assessment of the attractiveness of an investment (Douglas.
1992). The importance of time is evident in how VCs value companies in which they
invest (Sahlman. 1988). VCs target a harvest date (some number of years in the future)
and calculate their expected return by evaluating the target venture's pro forma financials
(i.e.. projected net income) and the price/earnings ratio that the firm might generate at
that future time. The concern for harvesting sooner rather than later may be related to the
V C s present value of the expected return or issues of liquidity."
Bygrave and Timmons (1991) found that companies that went public within 34
months of the first round of financing had a higher time-adjusted rate of return (287%
versus 158%).'* An initial public offering appears to offer the entrepreneurial company
a number of benefits, including legitimacy with stakeholders, access to debt capital
(Sutton & Benedetto, 1988), and a mechanism by which entrepreneurs can reacquire
1 However, this assumption does not appear to be appropriate for web-based businesses, which often have
negative profits yet high valuations.
'> An attractive IPO market is one that provides both high company valuations and liquidity for both
entrepreneurs and investors.

mechanism (Sutton & Benedetto, 1988). Sahlman (1990) documents that almost all of
the returns on venture capital funds are earned on companies that go public. Bygrave and
Timmons (1991, p. 159) note that "hot IPO markets are by far the most important cause
of peaks in venture capital returns."
While there have been a number of studies that have investigated the company's
value at time of IPO (e.g.. Deeds, DeCarolis, & Coombs, 1997), rarely has the speed with
which a company reaches its IPO been investigated. Therefore, an interesting and important research question becomes: "What explains a portfolio company's speed to
IPO?" This question has not received much attention to date. This is surprising considering the importance of time in determining the attractiveness of an investment and the
importance of IPOs as exit mechanisms. A glance at the IPO market indicates that the
current attractive circumstances have not been evenly spread. Geographic regions, industry sectors, and periods in our history have developed differently. This paper utilizes
an ecosystem perspective to investigate the effects of geography, industry, and time to
gain a deeper understanding of a company's speed to IPO.

ECOSYSTEM AND COMPANY DEVELOPMENT
According to Lucas (1993), the pace of technical progress varies over time and
space. A powerful explanation for these spatial patterns of development is the unique
way a region's ecosystem combines to create the entrepreneurial momentum that spawns
increasing numbers of entrepreneurial start-ups and drives their growth towards IPO. Just
as with a natural ecosystem, "growth and success can be attributed to the incessant
formation of a multitude of specialized, diverse entities which feed off, support, and
interact with one another" (Bahrami & Evans. 1995, p. 63).

Geography
A number of models have been developed to explain regional development. The
view of economic geography proposed by Krugman (1991a, b) states that entrepreneurial
conditions within regions mutate and accelerate on the basis of what has been done
before. In this view, regions develop and evolve because of the pooling of demand for
specialized labor and the development of specialized intennediate goods industries
(Krugman, 1991a; Marshall, 1920). Knowledge also appears to be localized through
knowledge spillovers leading to interorganizational learning (Deeds et al., 1997).
As entrepreneurs commercialize innovations within the region, they draw supporting
infrastructure to the region (i.e., other entrepreneurial conditions such as financial support, commercial infrastructure, etc.). Economic success is a magnet for other engineers
and aspiring entrepreneurs. All combine to create a dynamic ecosystem that continues to
support innovation. Minniti (1999) asserts that regions with high entrepreneurship rates
are in a self-perpetuating equilibrium—and so are regions with low entrepreneurial rates.
Specifically to IPOs, Deeds et al. (1997) found that location has a significant relationship
to a biotechnology company's value at IPO.
Anecdotally, the Silicon Valley has led the way in the Internet boom, with such early
high fliers as Yahoo, Excite, etc. The boom in Silicon Valley has continued as more
recent Internet stars have been bom and grown at a rapid pace. Bahrami and Evans
(1995) note that the keys to the success ofthe Silicon Valley ecosystem are (1) venture
capital, (2) a talent pool of knowledgeable professionals, (3) universities and research
institutions, (4) a professional service infrastructure, and (5) customers and lead users of
innovation.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->We propose that a strong ecosystem not only increases the birth rate of new organizations but also provides a nurturing environment that allows it to develop faster and
therefore reach IPO earlier. However, with a lack of empirical evidence on differences
between regions in the degree that each creates a nurturing environment, we offer an
exploratory hypothesis based upon the anecdotal evidence of regions with high birth
rates for new organizations. Thus,
HI: Geographical location within the U.S. affects the speed to IPO of portfolio
companies that have gone public.
H2: U.S. portfolio companies based in the West have greater speed to IPO than
portfolio companies from the Northeast, South, and Midwest.

Industry
Entrepreneurs (and VCs' investments) tend to cluster in attractive industries (e.g.,
biotech, Internet-related industries, etc.). While there is dispute amongst strategy scholars over the relative effect of corporate strategy and industry on business unit performance, there appears to be agreement that the type of industry has a significant effect on
venture performance (Rumelt, 1991; McGahan & Porter. 1997; Roquebert, Phillips, &
Westfall, 1996). Bygrave, Johnstone, Lewis, and Ullman (1998) investigated the differences between companies that had gone public from 1994 to 1997. They found that
certain high-tech industry segments were faster to IPO than others (i.e.. Internet <
Software < Hardware < Semiconductors) and relative returns also differed (i.e., Internet
5079^, Software, 125%, Hardware 148%, and Semiconductor 31%). The differences
were attributable to the different phase of the industry lifecycle that each business
was in.
In general, an industry progresses through phases once the necessary resource endowments of basic scientific knowledge, financing, and competent human resources
begin to interact (Van de Ven & Garud, 1989, 1993). These phases are iterative, where
the capabilities developed in one phase provide the basis for the next phase (Mathews,
1997). The emergence of computers and then the Internet represents a classic example.
The Internet industry is growing rapidly as more and more people go on-line. Today,
about 30% of all U.S. households are on-line, and that is expected to grow to over 50%
by 2003 (McQuivey, Gazala, Lanpher. & Metzger, 1999).
Firms in the growth stage of the industry lifecycle typically face less competition and
higher potential profits than those in later stages (Timmons, 1999). Such attributes are
likely to be seen as desirable by investors and they will enter the market earlier to acquire
an equity stake in such companies. The rapid growth associated with high-technology
sectors implies that they will be quicker to IPO than non-high-technology sectors. Thus,
H3a: Industry sector affects the speed to IPO of portfolio companies that have gone
public.
H3b: Portfolio companies from the high-technology sectors have greater speed to
IPO than those from non-high-technology sectors.

Trends in the IPO Market
While there appears to be a self-perpetuating equilibrium for regions with considerable entrepreneurship and industries that are highly attractive, an important attribute of
the environment is how "hot" the IPO market is. The IPO market is cyclical (Bygrave,
1999). At some points in time, the IPO market is unattractive, meaning that firms receive
poor valuations. During hot markets, the market for IPOs rises substantially, lifting the
market capitalization of certain stocks (Ibbotson & Jaffe, 1975; Ritter, 1984).
Spring, 2001

61

<-----Page 3----->The recent explosion of Internet IPOs has been striking in terms of the size of
company capitalization and the returns those early investors have received. The average
valuation of VC-backed IPO companies has increased from $163 million in 1995 to $503
million in 1999 (Venture Economics, 2000a). In years past, companies were not viable
IPO prospects unless they had 18 months of consecutive profits; however, today, revenue
growth of 200% per year seems to drive which companies are attractive IPO candidates
(Rosenberg, 1999). It is relatively common for newly public companies to have never
had a profitable quarter, and to not forecast profit for as long as two years hence. These
returns should not be looked upon as chance or luck, as research has shown that seasoned
VCs are particularly proficient at taking companies public during market peaks (Lemer,
1994)—jt appears that VCs will work with entrepreneurs to race and catch an open IPO
window. Thus,
H4a: The relative activity of the IPO market over time affects the speed to IPO.
H4b: Portfolio companies that have gone public more recently have greater speed to
IPO.

Contingent Relationships
An important consideration of the ecosystem perspective is the differential effects
that time can have. For example, some regions may develop at a faster rate than other
regions because they have accumulated the necessary infrastructure or achieved a critical
mass. Alternatively, one region may be uniquely positioned to support the next wave of
entrepreneurial ventures. Similarly, ventures within certain industries may be well situated to capitalize on what the IPO market sees as the next "hot" area. This suggests a
number of contingent relationships. There is insufficient theory to hypothesize the nature
of these relationships, although they will be explored in the discussion section below.
Thus,
H5a: When a portfolio company goes public moderates the relationship between
geographic location and speed to IPO.
H5b: When a portfolio company goes public moderates the relationship between
industry and speed to IPO.

RESEARCH METHODS
Sample
The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), along with the company Venture Economics, has created a database of VC deals from 1984 to June 1999.^ The
NVCA members (primarily senior managers or vice presidents of the VC firms) provided information on their portfolio companies and investment activity through a
NVCA-endorsed survey. Those portfolio companies that are based in the U.S. and have
gone public were included in this article's sample. This represents 906 portfolio companies that have gone public.^

Dependent and Independent Variables
The dependent variable is speed to IPO and is operationalized by the number of days
from the company's founding (i.e., start-up) to its IPO. The independent variables are
4. The database is being continually updated, although for the purposes of this paper the latest information
is for June 1999.
5. The sample investigated here will raise questions for, but not generalize to, non-VC-backed companies
or companies (VC-backed or not) that have not yet gone (or never will go) public.

<-----Page 4----->geography, industry group, and the macro-economic trend. The portfolio company's
geographical location within the U.S. is categorized into four regions: the Northeast
(including New England, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), the South (including North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Arkansas), the
Midwest (including Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, Illinois,
and Nebraska), and the West (including Arizona, Colorado, and California).
Industry group has been classified by Venture Economics. Venture Economics provides a series of more detailed classifications of industry type. The classifications we
used were communication (including telephone, facsimile, data, satellite, etc.); computer
related, semiconductors and other electronics (including hardware, software, services,
semiconductors, electronic equipment, fiber optics); biotechnology and medical/health
(including biotech—human, animal, and industrial—biosensors, medical diagnosis and
therapeutics); and non-high-technology (manufacturing, transportation, industrial/
energy, finance/insurance/real estate, agriculture/forestry/fishing).
Trend in the IPO market was operationalized by classifying the portfolio company's
date of IPO into one of two groups: before 1998 and 1998 to present. We chose 1998
because there seems to be a shift in IPO mindset around that time. Pre-1998 was
characterized by a more traditional mindset. Another aspect is the increasing valuations
of public companies: the valuation of VC-backed IPO companies has increased from
$163 million in 1995 to $503 million in 1999, with the largest increases occurring after
the lull in 1997 (Venture Economics, 2000a).

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

faster to IPO than the Northeast (-527 days and -572 days respectively).^ These findings
provide support for hypotheses 1 and 2a. Hypotheses 2b (West faster than South) and 2c
(West faster than Midwest) were not supported. Industry group did not significantly
affect speed to IPO. except between non-high-technology industries and the computer
industry. Interestingly, non-high-technology companies were faster to IPO (by 468 days)
than companies primarily involved in computer-related products, semiconductors and
other electronics. Therefore, hypothesis 3a is not supported and hypothesis 3b is actually
in the opposite direction to that predicted. Finally, tho.se portfolio companies that went
public after 1997 were speedier to IPO than those that went public before 1997 (by 438
days). This provides support for both hypotheses 4a and 4b.
Table 3 shows the results of the multivariate ANOVA. which indicates that geographical region within the U.S. trend, and the interaction of the two all significantly
explain variance in speed to IPO (p < .05). Industry is marginally significant in its
explanation of speed to IPO. These findings provide support for hypotheses 1. 4a. and
5a, and marginal support for 3a. The model explains a significant portion of the variance
(R- of .06. p < .05).
Due to the exploratory nature of this paper, we included an empirical test for
two-way interactions. As indicated above, there was a significant interaction. Interpretation of interactions involving categorical variables is challenging and really suggests
that follow-up research is required using more rich data. In an attempt to gain a deeper
understanding of the interaction between region and trend, the means for all level
combinations were calculated and are reported in Table 4. The findings suggest that
portfolio companies from the West are now faster to IPO than they were prior to 1998
(p < .01). The Midwest and the South are marginally faster to IPO in recent years than
in the past (p < .10).

CONCLUSION
Discussion
The goal of this research was to examine macro-level factors that affect speed to
IPO, an important determinant to VC returns (and by extension entrepreneur returns).
The speed to IPO is associated with a venture's ecosystem, namely, its geographic
location and macroeconomic trends (its industry was marginally significant). The find-

<-----Page 7----->ings of this study offer direction for future micro-level research as well as implications
for practicing VCs.
Hypotheses 1 and 2, which suggest that geography is important, are supported.
Those ventures located in the West were faster to IPO than those from the Northeast.
This finding is consistent with ecosystem studies that have tried to gain a greater
understanding of why the West, in particular Silicon Valley (Saxenian, 1994), has been
such a success. It appears that the more developed a region's entrepreneurial ecosystem
and tradition, the faster its ventures proceed to IPO. Surprisingly, the Midwest was also
faster to IPO than the Northeast.
It was also somewhat surprising that non-high-technology companies are faster to
IPO than computer and semiconductor companies (hypothesis 3). One possible explanation may be that high-technology ventures take longer to develop. For example, the
technology may not be proven, it may take considerable time to build a prototype, it may
take a while to communicate the new technology's benefits, which slows market acceptance and adoption, etc. More fine-grained investigation is required to answer why this
high-tech sector is slower to IPO.
Portfolio companies that have gone public more recently have greater speed to IPO
(hypothesis 4). We have suggested that this is due to the increasing attractiveness of the
IPO market. We believe entrepreneurs and VCs realize that the favorable IPO conditions
are unlikely to remain indefinitely and there is a concerted effort to go public before the
window of opportunity closes. Gompers (1996) finds that young VC firms take companies public earlier than older VC firms with good reputations in order to grandstand—
establish a reputation to successfully raise capital for new ventures. The entry of more
that 550 new VC firms since 1993 (Pratt, 1999) and the incentive for young firms to
grandstand could partially explain the increased speed to IPO in recent years. Therefore,
the attractive IPO market in recent years could be responsible for encouraging VC firm
entry, increasing grandstanding, and thus speed to IPO. Our macro fmdings are consistent with this logic.
This paper suggests that the relationship between the attractiveness of the macroeconomic environment (operationalized by IPO date) does not apply to all regions
equally. While portfolio companies from the Midwest and West were faster to IPO than
the Northeast, it appears that the speed to IPO for those from the West has increased even
more than the other regions in recent years (p < .01). This finding is consistent with
anecdotal evidence on the rapid rise of the Silicon Valley area as an effective ecosystem.
As Bahrami and Evans (1995) suggest, venture capital is a key component to a strong
ecosystem and the Silicon Valley continues to dwarf other regions. In 1999, the Silicon
Valley accounted for over 35% of all venture capital investments or $17 billion. The
Northeast was a distant second with $9.6 billion or 20% (Venture Economics, 2000b).
There was no support for a trend/industry interaction.

Euture Research and Implications
The macro-level findings suggest several interesting questions for finei-srained studies. First, what is behind the Midwest's surprising speed to IPO relative to the Northeast?
It may be a function of the VCs who are backing these ventures. First, are these VCs
primarily based in the Midwest, or are VCs from the West and Northeast backing the
Midwest companies? Do these VCs have closer ties to investment banks? Are they
leveraging their own resources by pushing ventures to IPO faster so they have fewer
follow-on rounds? Are they moving the venture too quickly to IPO, at least from the
perception of the entrepreneur? Since the Midwest is faster to IPO than the Northeast
we would expect the returns for investors to be higher, but is this the case? If not, are
66

<-----Page 8----->other factors coming into play? Could it be that the Midwest has newer venture capital
firms grandstanding in order to gain legitimacy?
Another interesting line of inquiry would be to understand why the West is becoming
increasingly fast at nurturing portfolio companies to IPO, Considering that the post-1997
IPO market has been very "hot," why have the other regions not responded in similar
ways as the West? Is this a short-term anomaly or does it portend a more fundamental
systematic shift? Although these two areas are of great interest, there are a number of
other research questions that arise from this research. Direct implications for VCs and
entrepreneurs are not clear from this macro-level investigation of interaction effects.
More fine-grained research is required to more fully understand this relationship.
In conclusion, the contribution ofthe current study is an identification of macro-level
factors and trends affecting speed to IPO, along with a framework, an ecosystem perspective, which places these results in context. It is hoped that this paper has spawned
some interest to look further into these differences.
