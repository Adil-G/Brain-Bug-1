Data Analysis and
Modeling Longitudinal Processes
DAVID CHAN
National University of Singapore
This article presents a nontechnical overview of the major data analysis techniques for modeling
longitudinal processes, with an explicit focus on their advantages and disadvantages as tools for
drawing inferences about different specific aspects of change over time. It is argued that traditional longitudinal analysis techniques offer limited ways of addressing many specific questions
about change. Recent advances in latent variable techniques, when adequately driven by theory,
design, and measurement, offer a unified and flexible framework for addressing such questions.
Keywords: longitudinal analysis; assessment of change; latent variable; growth modeling

In group and organizational management research, many of the questions of
interest concern longitudinal processes that focus on the pattern of intraunit
change over time. The unit of theory may be at the individual, group, or organizational level of conceptualization. Examples of these three levels are a
study of changes in the extent of information seeking by organizational newcomers over time, a study of changes in group cohesion over time, and a study
of changes in organizational culture over time, respectively.
In quantitative longitudinal research, regardless of the unit of theory, the
process nature or time-based change of the data has to be explicitly modeled
by an appropriate data analysis technique to translate the longitudinal data
obtained into substantive inferences about the longitudinal process of interest. Recent advances in data analysis allow researchers to apply appropriate
techniques to make more direct inferences from longitudinal data. Unfortunately, the majority of the work in data analysis, particularly recent advances
in latent variable modeling, is highly technical and may not be easily understood by group and organizational management researchers who may not be
experts in data analysis. Moreover, although individual cookbook or how-to
treatments and substantive applications of specific techniques are available,
there is a lack of an integrative overview of the various longitudinal analysis

techniques to serve as a framework or heuristic to guide researchers in the
selection of the appropriate technique for application in their specific substantive investigations. To attempt to bridge this gap, this article presents a
nontechnical overview of the major longitudinal data analysis techniques,
with an explicit focus on their advantages and disadvantages as tools for
drawing inferences about different aspects of change over time. In the interest of space, only the basic logic of each technique and the features necessary
for understanding its relationship with specific aspects of change over time
are presented. More details, particularly technical information, of each technique are readily available in the relevant literature, some of which is listed in
the Reference section.
Before one can select the appropriate data analysis technique, the specific
question about the change over time in the longitudinal process must be
explicated (Chan, 1998a). One way to broadly classify these questions is to
group them into descriptive and explanatory questions. A descriptive question asks how an individual, group, or organization changes over time on one
or more focal variables (e.g., feedback seeking, group cohesion, organizational climate for safety). For example, in a study of changes in group cohesion over time, one may ask whether the change in group cohesion is reversible. That is, does the trajectory of change in cohesion follow some
monotonically increasing or decreasing (e.g., linear) functional form that
represents an irreversible (at least within the longitudinal time period studied) change or some nonmonotonic functional form (e.g., an inverted U) that
represents reversible change over time? Another example of a descriptive
question is whether the change in the focal variable is simply a direct quantitative change in magnitude, often referred to as alpha change, or a qualitative
change in the conceptualization, often referred to as gamma change, of the
construct of interest (Chan, 1998a; Golembiewski, Billingsley, & Yeager,
1976). In newcomer adaptation research, an interesting question concerns
whether organizational commitment is changing in strength only (alpha
change) or in dimensionality (gamma change) over time.
Although the descriptive question is concerned with the what or how of
the change trajectory, the explanatory question focuses on the why by seeking to understand and predict the pattern of intraunit change over time
described by (i.e., obtained from) the data. The variation to be explained or
predicted here is typically the interunit differences in intraunit changes over
time. Consider the case where all groups follow a positive linear trajectory of
change in group cohesion but differ in the rate of change (i.e., slope). If this
intergroup variation in rate of change is systematic and not due to measurement error, then addressing the explanatory question may involve seeking to
understand and predict the variation by incorporating one or more explan-

atory variables (e.g., group size) in the model of change and estimating their
predictive validity. The explanatory variable can either be a time-invariant or
a time-varying predictor.
Descriptive and explanatory questions constitute broad ways of categorizing questions about longitudinal processes. These broad categories are
useful in helping researchers generate or identify relevant questions about
longitudinal processes. However, an adequate study requires explicit linkages among theory/hypotheses, selection of study variables/measures/
design, data analysis, and inferences from results. To explicate these linkages, it is necessary to go beyond each broad category to more specific questions about particular aspects of the change over time. The adequacy to which
the relevant specific change questions are addressed forms a primary component of the basis on which researchers evaluate the appropriateness of the
application of a data-analytic technique in a particular substantive investigation. There are at least nine fundamental questions corresponding to different
aspects of change over time. I have given extensive treatment of these questions in Chan (1998a). I only briefly summarize the questions below. The
major longitudinal analysis techniques are then discussed in terms of their
strengths and weaknesses in addressing the relevant specific change questions. I argue that traditional techniques are limited in their ability to answer
many of these questions, whereas recent advances in latent variable techniques offer a unified and flexible framework for addressing such questions.

FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ON CHANGE OVER TIME
Chan’s (1998a) nine fundamental questions highlight the complexities
involved when considering change over time and the importance of clarifying the specific question asked of the change phenomenon (i.e., identifying
the specific aspect of change), which in turn provides the basis for evaluating
the change analysis and the substantive inferences made from data. The questions are summarized below.
Question 1: Is an observed change over time (and observed between-group differences in change over time) due to meaningful systematic differences or random fluctuations resulting from measurement error?

If measurement error is not adequately taken into account when specifying
the data analysis model and estimating the parameters, results of the analyses
can be severely affected by measurement error. The classic independence-oferrors assumption, which is common among many traditional data analysis

techniques, may be violated when assessing change over time in longitudinal
designs. This violation is likely to occur when the longitudinal data are collected on measurement occasions closely spaced together using identical
measures.
Question 2: Is the change over time reversible?

The question on the reversibility of change over time can be construed in
terms of the functional form of the intraunit growth (change) trajectory. For
example, monotonically increasing or decreasing (e.g., linear) functional
forms represent irreversible (within the time period studied) change in the
sense that there is no returning or restoring to previous levels on the focal
variable, at least during the period under investigation. On the other hand, a
nonmonotonic functional form (e.g., an inverted U) would represent reversible change over time.
Question 3: Is the change over time proceeding in one single pathway or through
multiple different pathways?

Two (or more) groups of individuals may follow the same or different trajectories as they proceed from one time point to another (through intervening
time points measured in the study). For example, in a four-time-point study,
two groups may have the same value on the focal variable at initial status
(Time 1) and at end point (Time 4), but one group may follow a positive linear
trajectory and the other a positively accelerated, monotonically increasing
trajectory. That is, change from one value of the focal variable at Time 1 to
another value at Time 4 could proceed through multiple different pathways.
Question 4: Is the change on the quantitative variable proceeding in a gradual
manner or is it best characterized as large-magnitude shifts at each time
interval?

Quantitative change over time may proceed gradually as characterized by a
linear trajectory with a low slope or it may be characterized in terms of largemagnitude changes as represented by a high slope.
Question 5: Is the change over time (or across groups) to be considered as alpha,
beta, or gamma change?

Golembiewski et al. (1976) distinguished three types of change: alpha, beta,
and gamma. Alpha change refers to changes in absolute levels given a constant conceptual domain and a constant measuring instrument. One can

345

meaningfully speak of alpha change only when there is measurement
invariance of responses across time. Measurement invariance across time
exists when the numerical values across time waves are on the same measurement scale (Drasgow, 1984, 1987). Measurement invariance could be construed as absence of beta and gamma changes. Beta change refers to changes
in absolute level complicated by changes in the measuring instrument given a
constant conceptual domain. Beta change occurs when there is a
recalibration of the measurement scale. That is, in beta change, the observed
change results from an alteration in the respondent’s subjective metric or
evaluative scale rather than an actual change in the construct of interest.
Gamma change refers to changes in the conceptual domain. Gamma change
(i.e., change in the meaning or conceptualization of the construct[s] of interest) can take a variety of forms. For example, in the language of factor analysis, the number of factors (a factor representing a construct) assessed by a
given set of measures may change from one time point to another.
Question 6: Is the change over time occurring at the individual, the group, or both
levels of conceptualization?

Change over time can be conceptualized and assessed at the individual level,
the group level (e.g., team, department), or both levels. Any analytic technique that is restricted to only one level of conceptualization and analysis is
limited in an important way because the assumption of no or irrelevant
change at the other level is not tested.
Question 7: In addition to detecting interunit in intraunit change, can one predict
(and hence increase understanding of) these differences?

Units (e.g., individuals) may systematically differ in the way they change
over time. Understanding can increase if the longitudinal modeling can
incorporate additional variables and assess their efficacy in predicting the
different aspects of these interunit differences (e.g., individual differences in
rate of change, individual differences in trajectory forms).
Question 8: Are there cross-domain relationships in change over time?

Changes in one focal variable may be related to changes in another focal variable. For example, during the period of newcomer adaptation, the rate of
change in information seeking may be positively correlated with the rate of
change in task mastery. An adequate longitudinal modeling technique would
allow researchers to explicitly model these cross-domain relationships.

GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT

Question 9: Do the various relationships with respect to specific facets of change
over time vary or remain invariant across groups?

Different groups may either share or differ in the various specific facets of
intraunit changes. An adequate longitudinal modeling technique would
allow researchers to explicitly model and test the various hypotheses concerning between-group differences or similarities in change over time.

TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING LONGITUDINAL DATA
The major longitudinal analysis techniques reviewed here are classified as
traditional or latent variable techniques. Traditional techniques include (a)
difference scores, (b) repeated measures analysis of variance and regression,
and (c) time series model. Latent variable techniques include (d) longitudinal
factor analysis, (e) longitudinal mean and covariance structures analysis, and
(f) longitudinal growth modeling, which together lead to a unified analytical
framework.
DIFFERENCE SCORES

Traditionally, intraunit change has been examined using data collected at
two points in time and assessed by some two-wave analysis such as computing a difference score or a residual change score (Willett, 1989). Two-wave
designs are widely employed in longitudinal studies in organizational
research. However, two-wave analyses have been a source of much debate.
Within the organizational and management literature, the debate over the
appropriateness of difference scores for change analysis, which started in the
1950s and continued into the 1990s (for a recent debate, see Edwards [1994]
and Tisak & Smith [1994a, 1994b]), has attracted most attention. The difference score has been criticized for its purported inability to be reliable and
valid, its frequent negative correlation with initial status, and its relatively
low reliability (e.g., Bereiter, 1963; Cronbach & Furby, 1970; Linn & Slinde,
1977). Some critics have even argued that the use of difference scores for
change assessment should be discontinued (e.g., Cronbach & Furby, 1970;
Johns, 1981; Werts & Linn, 1970). However, many of these criticisms were
subsequently shown to be founded on misconception, and Rogosa and others
(e.g., Rogosa, Brandt, & Zimowski, 1982; Rogosa & Willett, 1983, 1985;
Zimmerman & Williams, 1982) have demonstrated that the difference score
can be an intuitive and unbiased simple measure of individual growth
(change).

Although the difference score can be an unbiased measure of individual
change, only very limited information on intraunit change over time can be
obtained from a difference score analysis. The problem lies in the limitation
of the two-wave design rather than in any inherent deficiency in the difference score. In addition to the well-established validity problems inherent in
two-wave designs for assessing change over time (e.g., Campbell & Stanley,
1963; Cook & Campbell, 1979; Cook, Campbell, & Peracchio, 1990), such
designs are problematic for assessing change over time because measurements are repeated at only two points in time and, as such, they provide no
precise information on intraunit change over time. That is, no precise individual growth curves (trajectories) can be plotted for the units. In two-wave
designs, there are two observations over time for a single individual, and the
most complex functional form that can be fitted is a straight line passing
through the two data points. There is no way to evaluate the adequacy of the
straight-line functional form for the growth (i.e., change over time). In addition, there is no way to compare the fit between the straight-line function and
other growth curves such as quadratic or cubic curves that could pass perfectly through the same two data points (Rogosa, 1995). The two-wave
design represents two snapshots of a continuous growth process (Bryk &
Weisberg, 1977). Without the ability to assess the functional form of the trajectory that most adequately describes intraunit change over time, the simple
difference score analysis of data from two time points clearly fails to answer
the fundamental descriptive questions on change over time. Descriptive
questions such as whether the change over time is reversible or follows a
hypothesized functional form cannot be addressed.
To address two-wave problems, repeated measurement from individuals
over multiple (i.e., three or more) time points is needed. Multiwave repeated
measurement within a longitudinal design allows the assessment of the
intraunit change process as it unfolds over time. A large number of techniques have been developed to analyze data collected from these multiwave
designs. In addition, other techniques, which are within-subjects analyses
rather than specifically developed to analyze longitudinal data, can be and
have been employed to assess change over time in multiwave designs. The
best-established examples of such techniques are repeated measures
ANOVA and repeated measures regression, which are described next.
REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA AND REGRESSION

Repeated measures ANOVA and repeated measures regression, which
were developed to handle within-subjects factors/predictors, can be applied
to the analysis of longitudinal data by simply treating time as the

GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT

within-subjects factor/predictor. Both repeated measures techniques attempt
to detect differences in means of the focal variable as it repeats over time
within the longitudinal design.
Although these repeated measures analyses are straightforward extensions of the general linear model, substantive application of these techniques
to longitudinal analysis is often problematic. Bergh (1995) reviewed how
repeated measures analysis has been applied in the organizational literature.
On the basis of a content analysis of 86 studies, Bergh concluded that organizational researchers, when applying repeated measures analysis techniques,
often failed to control for violations in data assumptions, perform analysis of
characteristics of differences in measurement means, and fully test
multivariate models.
In addition to the issues raised by Bergh (1995), researchers need to pay
more attention to the explicit linkage between the logic of the repeated measures analysis and the underlying theory of change as it relates to the nine fundamental questions discussed above. To illustrate, consider the notion of violation of analytical assumptions in repeated measures ANOVA. The validity
of the repeated measures ANOVA application is dependent on several
important data assumptions. One assumption is that the common,
orthonormalized variance-covariance matrix of the time observations is
spherical. That is, the matrix demonstrates constant variance across time
observations and constant covariance between time observations. Huynh and
Mandeville (1979) demonstrated that sphericity is a necessary and sufficient
condition for the validity of repeated measures ANOVA. When sphericity is
violated, the F test in repeated measures ANOVA becomes too liberal and
biases the value upward. Box’s (1954) epsilon is an index of the departure
from sphericity and can be used to correct the biased F test. However, as
noted by Chan (1998a), it is important to realize that in the context of
intraunit change over time, it is simplistic to conceptualize the sphericity
assumption as merely a statistical hurdle to be cleared for appropriate application of an analytic technique (i.e., repeated measures ANOVA) to the
change assessment. As noted above, individuals (or some other level of unit
of theory) may differ systematically in their individual growth parameters.
For example, all individuals may share a positive (increasing) linear trajectory and be very similar in initial status (at Time 1) but differ in their rate of
change (slope). Given this pattern of intraindividual change, one would
rightly expect lack of constant variance across time observations. However,
this lack of constant variance (i.e., violation of sphericity) is substantively
meaningful because it reflects systematic interindividual differences in
intraindividual change over time. Repeated measures ANOVA fails to structure these meaningful differences in intraindividual change patterns, and the

very existence of these true differences violates the statistical assumption of
the technique. Hence, repeated measures ANOVA is inherently deficient for
examining differences in individual growth trajectories. When such differences exist, it makes little sense to correct for departure from sphericity.
Techniques that do not assume sphericity and can directly address the fundamental questions of change are needed.
Because repeated measures ANOVA and repeated measures regression
assume that the same construct is repeatedly measured over time and with the
same precision (in fact, without measurement error) and focus on the detection of differences in means over time, they suffer from many common inadequacies as techniques for assessing change over time. These inadequacies
become clear when one relates the techniques to the fundamental questions
on change. When these traditional repeated measures techniques are applied
to assess change over time, it is generally assumed that the change of interest
is a quantitative change (over time or across groups) on the same continuous
variable as opposed to a qualitative change or conceptual difference (over
time or across groups) in the focal construct (Question 4). This is part of the
larger assumption that only alpha change exists and there are no beta or
gamma changes (Question 5). Often, measurement error is not accounted for
in the analysis, and the researcher has to assume that any measurement error
that exists does not obscure the true nature of the change patterns (Question
1). Also, change over time is generally assumed to be unitary rather than
multipath (Question 3). It is not clear how the growth trajectories of individuals who have similar levels in initial status and similar levels at the last time
wave can be grouped into different pathways. This problem is largely a result
of the fact that the techniques used do not have a model for structuring individual growth trajectories and identifying and comparing different functional forms of trajectories because no individual growth parameters are
defined or estimated. It follows that there is no systematic way of relating
interunit differences in intraunit changes over time to individual predictors of
these differences (Question 7). In addition, many traditional techniques do
not allow the researcher to model the distinction between change patterns
occurring at the group level and those occurring at the individual level (Question 6). Although some idea on reversibility of change over time (Question 2)
may be inferred at the group level by plotting the focal variable over time, no
precise definition and representation of the functional form of the growth trajectory is provided, and reversibility at the individual level of analysis is not
assessed because no individual growth trajectories are specified. Because of
the above inadequacies, it is not meaningful to talk about cross-domain relationships of change patterns over time (Question 8) or multiple-group comparisons of specific facets of change patterns (Question 9).

TIME SERIES MODELS

In the most general sense, time series models include all longitudinal analysis techniques insofar as time series models analyze a sequence of observations generated through time (Schmitz, 1990; Vandaele, 1983). In practice,
the term time series models is often used to refer to specific classes of techniques developed to describe a relatively long series of observations typically
consisting of several tens of time points. One way to classify these time series
techniques is to distinguish between two general subclasses of models,
namely, time domain and frequency domain models. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are representative of time domain
models, whereas spectral analysis models are representative of frequency
domain models.
Time domain and frequency domain models differ in how they represent
the same time series information. Time domain models analyze the longitudinal data and make inferences based on the autocorrelations in the sequence
of observations (autocorrelation refers to the correlation between later items
in a time series and earlier items; when the time series is completely random,
the autocorrelation is zero). The time series is expressed in terms of an
autoregressive or some other time-based parameter. In these models, a given
observation in time is characterized as a weighted function of past observations of the same underlying process. These time series models, such as
ARIMA models, are typically used for forecasting purposes. Frequency
domain models, on the other hand, express and account for the time series
data in terms of trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine functions.
These functions are used to represent rhythms or cycles assumed to underlie
the time series data. Clearly, the choice between the two classes of models is
dependent on the nature of the research question at hand. For example, questions that forecast time points call for time domain models, whereas those
that assess rhythms or cycles within the data call for frequency domain
models.
Although both classes of time series models have potential applied value
in substantive longitudinal research in group and organizational management (e.g., frequency domain models can be applied to the study of mood
variability at the workplace), the requirement of a large number of repeated
measurements (i.e., at least tens of time points; Metzler & Nickel, 1986) in
the longitudinal design limits the actual applied value of these time series
models, at least in the current state of research.
More fundamentally, the researcher should evaluate the use of time series
models in terms of how they succeed or fail to address the various facets of
intraunit change over time in his or her specific research questions. Similar to

<-----Page 11----->Chan / DATA ANALYSIS

351

the traditional repeated measures techniques discussed earlier, the application of time series models assumes, without demonstrating it, that the change
of interest is a quantitative change (over time or across groups) on the same
continuous variable as opposed to a qualitative change or conceptual difference (over time or across groups) in the focal construct (Question 4). Again,
this is part of the larger and untested assumption that only alpha change exists
and there are no beta or gamma changes (Question 5). Measurement error is
not explicitly accounted for in time series analyses, and the researcher has to
assume that any measurement error that exists does not obscure the true
nature of the change patterns (Question 1).
Use of time series allows the study of reversibility of change over time
(Question 2) because each time series model presents the functional form of
the trajectory representing intraunit change. However, to assess whether
change over time is unitary or multipath (Question 3), one has to compare different distinct time series models, with each model representing an individual’s time series data or a group’s time series data. More important, within a
given time series model, the technique does not allow the researcher to model
the distinction between change patterns occurring at the group and those
occurring at the individual level (Question 6). Although it is possible to fit a
time series to an individual’s repeated observations (hence compare different
individuals’ function by comparing distinct time series models) or to the
summary statistics of a group of individuals (hence compare different
groups’ functions by comparing distinct time series models), it is not possible
to do both at the same time. That is, it is not possible, within a single time
series model, to examine a group’s intraindividual change function at the
aggregate (group) level and, at the same time, individual differences in
intraindividual change functions (Rovine & von Eye, 1991).
Without the flexibility to systematically represent, within a single analytic
model, individual differences in the parameters of individual change functions, there is no systematic way of relating interunit differences in intraunit
changes over time to predictors of these differences (Question 7). The inability to represent both individual- and group-level growth (intraindividual
change over time) information within a single analytic model also limits the
flexibility of time series for representing cross-domain relationships of
change patterns over time (Question 8) or making multiple-group comparisons of specific facets of change patterns (Question 9).
In short, traditional techniques are limited in important ways with respect
to addressing various aspects of change over time. In contrast, recent
advances allow several latent variable techniques to be integrated into a unified framework for assessing intraunit change over time.

GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT

In latent (unobserved) variable approaches to longitudinal modeling, a
variety of structural equation models can be fitted to the longitudinal data to
describe, in alternative ways, the change over time. Structural equation models make use of a set of hypothesized relationships between variables, both
observed and latent, to account for the observed pattern of relationships in a
covariance structure. Various parameters of the model are estimated from the
set of structural equations. An advantage of latent variable approaches is the
ability to explicitly take into account both cross-sectional and longitudinal
measurement errors. These approaches allow the researcher to model a variety of error covariance structures and assess any distorting effects that crosssectional or longitudinal measurement errors may have on the various parameter estimates of true change.
The different latent variable approaches differ in what they assert about
the various aspects of change over time. The next three subsections describe
the relevant latent variable approaches, which lead to an integrative twophase unified framework for conceptualizing and assessing intraunit change
over time. However, first note that autoregressive latent models, which are
among the simplest latent variable approaches, are inadequate for the analysis of longitudinal data representing intraunit change over time. In general,
autoregressive models estimate scores on a variable based on values of the
same variable. Proponents of the inclusion of autoregressive models in the
longitudinal modeling of intraunit change argue that the autoregressive
effect (the effect of the Time 1 measure on the Time 2 measure of the same
variable) is a legitimate competing explanation for an observed effect and
therefore must be included before causal inferences can be made regarding
the influence of other predictors of change over time. The inclusion of
autoregressive effects in longitudinal modeling of intraunit change is problematic because they tend to remove all potentially important predictors of
change except those that predict changes in rank order of the observations
over time. For example, in a monotonically stable growth process in which
all individuals increase at a constant rate (i.e., linearly) while maintaining the
same rank order, the important predictors of the individual slopes would be
eliminated with the inclusion of autoregressive effects. The autoregressive
model fails when intraunit change is accompanied by high-rank-order stability over time (Stoolmiller & Bank, 1995). In addition, the autoregressive
effect is questionable as a true causal effect, and researchers have argued that
proponents of its application in longitudinal modeling have misinterpreted
the autoregressive effect as a parameter representing a true causal effect
when it is in fact a stability coefficient representing the boundary or initial
values of the system. For more comprehensive discussions of the problems
associated with including autoregressive effects in longitudinal modeling of

LONGITUDINAL FACTOR ANALYSIS

Longitudinal factor analysis (LFA) requires multiple indicators (observed
measures) of the latent construct (i.e., the focal variable being examined for
intraunit change over time) at each time point of the longitudinal design. Figure 1 depicts a four-wave longitudinal factor-analytic model in which the
focal latent variable is measured by the same three indicators or items at each
time point. As shown in the figure, within each time point, the model is simply a single-common-factor model. Within each time point, the common factor (construct) loadings and unique factor (error term) loadings allow the separation of the observed variance in the items into common and specific
variance. In addition, because the same items are used over time, the model
separates the common covariance over time from the specific covariance
over time.
The LFA model directly addresses the questions of measurement
invariance over time in terms of whether the same construct is being measured over time and measured with the same precision (Questions 4 and 5).
That is, in addition to hypotheses on quantitative changes, LFA allows
hypotheses about qualitative changes over time to be tested. For example, a
researcher may hypothesize an integration process describing how an individual develops psychological safety climate perceptions. Let us suppose
that the hypothesized development is an integration process, moving from an
initial state in which distinct beliefs about various safety practices are

unrelated or, at best, loosely interrelated through progressive states in which
these separate beliefs become increasingly interrelated to the eventual state
in which they become integrated into a single global belief (Chan, 1998b).
The researcher now requires an analytical technique to test these hypothesized qualitative changes represented by the integration process. LFA is well
suited for this purpose.
In LFA, tests of qualitative change (also known as factorial change in the
language of LFA) are accomplished using widely used chi-square difference
tests of nested structure equation models. It is generally accepted (e.g., Alwin
& Jackson, 1981; Reise, Widaman, & Pugh, 1993; Sörbom, 1974) that evidence of measurement invariance across time is present if each time point has
the same number of factors (in this case, we expect a single factor at each time
point) with the same specific items loading on each factor (this equal factor
pattern is called configural invariance) and the factor loadings corresponding
to the identical items are equal across time points (this equal factor loading is
also called factorial invariance).
To perform the chi-square test of invariance over time, a LFA model in
which factor loadings across time are freely estimated (usually, one item is
selected as the reference indicator and its loading is fixed to 1 at each time
point for scaling purpose, i.e., λ11 = λ42 = λ73 = λ10,4 = 1 in Figure 1; Bollen,
1989) is first fitted to the data. Next, a second and more constrained model in
which factor loadings of the identical items are fixed to be equal and estimated (i.e., λ21 = λ52 = λ83 = λ11,4; λ31 = λ62 = λ93 = λ12,4) is fitted to the data. The
second model is nested under the first model and the difference in chi-square
values from both models is used as a test of statistically significant change in
fit between the models. A nonsignificant reduction in fit from the first (free
loadings) model to the second (equal loadings) model is taken as evidence of
equality of factor loadings, that is, evidence of measurement invariance. This
in turn indicates that if we fit a trajectory to represent intraunit change over
time, the trajectory would represent quantitative variations on the same construct rather than different noncomparable quantitative values from qualitatively different constructs. Conversely, a significant reduction in fit from the
less to the more constrained model would indicate inequality of factor loadings, that is, evidence of a lack of invariance. In this case, the researcher has
to reevaluate his or her theories of change and perhaps reformulate hypotheses or direct efforts to instrument development. If the researcher ignores this
lack of measurement invariance and proceeds to uncritically fit trajectories of
intraunit change over time, then results obtained from the trajectory models
are likely to be misleading.

Before fitting and directly comparing trajectories across groups, there is a
need to first establish evidence of measurement invariance across groups for
the same reason of comparability described earlier. The popular multiplegroup approach described by Jöreskog and Sörbom (1989) is used to assess
invariance across groups. The logic is similar to the nested model comparisons just described except that we now have two mutually exclusive samples
(groups). In this multiple-group assessment, a LFA model is fitted to the two
groups simultaneously. First, a model in which factor loadings are freely estimated (except for loadings of the reference indicator, which are fixed) across
groups is fitted to the data. Next, a second and more constrained model in
which factor loadings of the identical indicators are fixed to be equal across
groups is fitted to the data. As before, a nonsignificant reduction in fit from
the free-loadings model to the equal-loadings model indicates equality of
factor loadings across groups and is taken as evidence of measurement
invariance across groups. Conversely, a significant reduction in fit would
indicate inequality of factor loadings, that is, evidence of a lack of invariance.
Substantive examples on how LFA models can be used to systematically test
for measurement invariance across time can be found in Vandenberg and Self
(1993). For examples of testing invariance across time and groups, see Chan
(1998a).
LONGITUDINAL MEAN AND
COVARIANCE STRUCTURES ANALYSIS (LMACS)

Another latent variable technique is LMACS, which is an extension of
LFA whereby mean-level information is analyzed in addition to the variancecovariance information analyzed in LFA. A LMACS model is identical to the
LFA model depicted in Figure 1 with the exception that two types of parameter estimates are added to the model. The two are the intercepts (means), τs,
of the indicators and the factor means, µs.
Because the LMACS model is simply an LFA model with additional
parameters estimated, we can test for measurement invariance across time
and groups in a LMACS model in exactly the same way as in the LFA model
just described. However, the inclusion of factor means in LMACS provides a
useful way to change assessment that goes beyond testing for measurement
invariance. Specifically, the invariance or the lack of invariance of the factor
means, variances, and covariances across time or groups may reflect true
change patterns (Chan, 1998a). For example, if the true intraindividual
change over time for all individuals in a group follows a positive linear
growth trajectory and all individuals change at the same rate, then we would

<-----Page 16----->356

GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT

expect the factor means to increase rather than remain equal over time. Alternatively, if all individuals follow a positive linear growth trajectory and they
have similar levels at initial status but differ systematically in their individual
slopes, then we would expect differences in factor variances (increasing)
across time. In the two examples just described, the differences in factor
means and factor variances should be interpreted as a result of substantive
intraindividual change and substantive individual differences in
intraindividual change, respectively, rather than a lack of measurement
invariance, assuming we have demonstrated that there is a single factor
across time with corresponding equality of factor loadings. In areas of
research in which there are no well-established theories to derive specific
functional forms of the trajectories of change (e.g., changes in adaptive performance; Chan, 2000a, 2000b), LMACS serves as a useful preliminary
analysis, which both suggests and constrains the specific trajectory forms
from a virtually infinite number of possible trajectory forms to be fitted to the
data.
LATENT GROWTH MODELING (LGM),
EXTENSIONS USING MULTIPLE INDICATORS (MLGM),
AND THE INTEGRATIVE LMACS-MLGM FRAMEWORK

Latent growth modeling (LGM) is a flexible latent variable technique that
offers a direct and comprehensive assessment of the nature of true intraunit
changes and interunit differences in these changes. LGM also allows the estimation of the associations between these differences and time-invariant or
time-varying predictor variables, and hence addresses explanatory questions
on change over time.
A basic LGM model can be elaborated into a multiple-indicator model
(MLGM). The latter is essentially a LGM analysis in which the focal variable
of change is modeled as a latent variable represented by multiple indicators. I
have described LGM and MLGM in detail elsewhere (LGM: Chan, 2002;
Chan, Ramey, Ramey, & Schmitt, 2000; Chan & Schmitt, 2000; MLGM:
Chan, 1998a) and will only summarize the logic of the models here.
LGM represents the longitudinal data by modeling interunit differences in
the attributes (i.e., parameters) of intraunit changes over time (i.e., individual
growth curves). The model depicted in Figure 2 represents the basic form of a
univariate LGM (without multiple indicators) in which two parameters,
intercept (representing initial status) and slope (representing rate of change),
together describe a linear pattern of intraunit change over time. The variables
Y1 to Y4 refer to the focal variable measured at four points in time at equal
intervals. As shown in the figure, the LGM resembles the classic

confirmatory factor analysis. However, because repeated measures data
from the same variable (Y) are used, the latent factors are actually interpreted
as chronometric (time) common factors representing intraunit differences
over time rather than psychometric (measurement) common factors
(McArdle, 1988). Repeated measures polynomial ANOVA models are actually special cases of LGMs in which only the factor means are of interest
(Meredith & Tisak, 1990).
Using LISREL notation, we say that the first latent factor, labeled Intercept, ηI, is a constant for any given unit (e.g., individual) across time, hence
the fixed values of 1 for factor loadings on the repeated measures. The intercept factor represents information about the mean, µI, and variance,σ 2I , of the
collection of intercepts of each unit’s growth curve. The second latent factor,
labeled Slope, ηS, represents information about the mean, µS, and variance,
σ 2S , of the collection of slopes of each unit’s growth curve (for technical
details concerning choice of slope factor loadings and the variety of growth
models such as those that leave the shape of trajectory unspecified, include
additional growth factors to represent different curvilinear functions [Question 2], and has unequal time intervals, see Chan, 1998a). Both latent factors,
which are estimated from the data, are allowed to covary (estimated as σSI) as
indicated by the double-headed curved arrow between the factors. The εs

represent error variances in the repeated measures. The error variances can
either be freely estimated or fixed at certain values. They can also be constrained to be equal across repeated measurements. Similarly, provided that
the model is identified, any of the error covariances can either be freely estimated or fixed at certain values including zero, thus allowing a variety of a
priori error covariance structures to be modeled (Question 1).
In an LGM analysis, we can estimate the means and variances of the two
growth parameters (intercept and slope factors) and examine whether the two
parameters are correlated with each other. The means and variances allow us
to examine, within a single analytic model, intraindividual change at the
group level and individual level, respectively (Question 6). The LGM analysis can also be used to examine associations between the growth parameters
and predictor variables (Question 7). For example, in newcomer adaptation
research, we can use LGM to predict initial status and rate of change in information seeking from a proactive personality (Chan & Schmitt, 2000). Different univariate latent growth models can also be combined to form a
multivariate latent growth model. In a multivariate growth model, parameters from different change trajectories can be correlated to examine crossdomain associations (i.e., relationships between two focal variables being
examined for intraunit change over time, Question 8). For example, in a study
of interpersonal relationships, rate of change in relationship building can be
correlated with rate of change in social integration. One or more predictors
can also be included in the multivariate model, thereby allowing tests of
hypotheses regarding differential predictions (using the same predictor) of
intraunit change across domains. Finally, latent growth models (univariate or
multivariate) can be fitted simultaneously to different groups of units (e.g.,
gender, ethnic, occupational, experimental groups), and multiple-group
LGM analyses can be performed to test for across-groups invariance of one
or more of the specified relationships in the latent growth model (Questions 3
and 9). Any two distinct growth models, provided they share a nested relationship, can be tested for statistical significance of difference in model fit
using the chi-square difference test of nested latent variable models as
described earlier.
The majority of LGM applications have not incorporated measurement
invariance concerns in the model specification. To address these concerns
within the LGM framework, LGM can be extended to a MLGM in which the
focal variable of change is modeled as a latent variable assessed by multiple
indicators as opposed to a manifest variable as is typically the case in prior
work on LGM. In MLGM, the focal change variable is represented as a firstorder latent variable at each time point, the intercept and slope factors are

<-----Page 19----->Chan / DATA ANALYSIS

359

represented as second-order latent factors, and the predictors, if any, are represented as exogenous latent variables with structural effects on the intercept
and slope factors (represented as endogenous latent variables). For details,
see Chan (1998a).
The use of multiple indicators in a latent growth model allows both random and nonrandom measurement errors to be taken into account when
deriving the intercept and slope/shape factors. The use of multiple indicators
to assess the focal construct allows reliable (nonrandom) variance to be partitioned into true score common (construct) variance and true score unique
variance. True score unique variance is nonrandom and it is that portion of
variance in a measure that is not shared with other measures of the same construct. In LGM, the same measures are repeatedly administered over time.
Hence, a failure to partition nonrandom variance into true construct variance
and unique variance leads to distorted (inflated) estimates of true change in
the focal construct over time (Question 1). Because only scale/composite
level but no item-level (multiple indicator) information on the focal variable
is used in the standard LGM described earlier, the procedure does not provide
the isolation of nonrandom error variance from reliable variance and it takes
only random errors into consideration. MLGM addresses the problem.
Finally, Chan (1998a) combined the latent variable approaches described
above into a two-phase analytical procedure that provides a unified framework for conceptualizing and assessing change over time. In Phase 1 of this
integrative LMACS-MLGM framework, LMACS (of which LFA is simply a
subset) is used to examine issues of measurement invariance across time and
across groups (Questions 4 and 5). These issues have logical priority because
establishing invariance provides evidence that results of subsequent growth
modeling constituting Phase 2 of the procedure are meaningful. Building
invariance assessments into the analytic procedure as the first logical step to
longitudinal modeling contrasts with the analytical models that left untested
the assumption of measurement invariance across time or groups (e.g., the
traditional techniques discussed earlier). In addition to invariance assessments, Phase 1 of the procedure helps in the preliminary assessment of the
basic form of intraunit change by identifying the constraints on the patterns
of true score (factor) means and variances over time. In Phase 2, MLGM is
used to directly assess change over time by explicitly and simultaneously
modeling the group and individual growth trajectories of the focal variable as
well as their relationships to other time-invariant predictors and/or timevarying correlates (i.e., growth trajectories in a different domain). As
explained above, LMACS and MLGM together provide a unified framework
for directly addressing the nine fundamental questions on change over time.

framework in organizational research, see Chan (1998a).

SOME CAUTIONARY REMARKS
For all the latent variable techniques described in this article, the focal
change variable is assumed to be continuous in nature. The techniques were
not intended to handle categorical variables, although it is possible to adapt
them to accommodate categorical and other nonnormal variables (Muthen,
1984, 1996). In cases where the change variable is categorical and the interest
is in modeling qualitative changes or shifts over time from one categorical
state to another, analytic models such as survival analysis, event history analysis, and latent class analysis for stage-sequential dynamic variables are well
suited. Excellent examples of substantive applications of these three analytic
models are available, respectively, in Morita, Lee, and Mowday (1989); Harrison and Hulin (1989); and Collins (1991).
The strengths of latent variable techniques include the ability to explicitly
account for the biasing effects of random measurement error and model different a priori error covariance structures, test a variety of complex theoretical interrelationships among variables, make more direct inferences from
and enhance the explanatory power of nonexperimental data by testing and
ruling out alternative models, assess the effects of imposing restrictive
assumptions on a set of relationships, and assess a variety of specific measurement and structural relationships across multiple groups. Latent variables models including LGM can also be easily extended to specify
mediational effects linking predictors to focal change variables via intervening variables.
Because the problem of attrition is typical in studies employing longitudinal designs, the issue of small sample sizes is likely to be problematic in
applications of latent variable techniques, which require large sample sizes.
When subjects are lost at different repeated measurement occasions, we have
incomplete data at the individual level across the selected number of time
waves. To obtain adequate models of growth trajectories, recent extensions
of standard latent growth models have been developed to deal with this
incomplete data problem. These extensions essentially apply the logic of
convergence analysis to “recover” missing longitudinal information.
Accounts and empirical examples of these extensions are available in
Duncan and Duncan (1994); Duncan, Duncan, and Hops (1994); and
McArdle and Hamagami (1991). Note, however, that although these

<-----Page 21----->Chan / DATA ANALYSIS

361

extensions may be able to deal adequately with random missing data situations, they are likely to lead to model misspecifications and misleading interpretations due to biased parameter estimates when applied indiscriminately
to situations of nonrandom patterns of missing data.
Like any other analytic model, latent variable techniques have no magical
solutions if a study has poor design and instrument development, or if the
measurements, time intervals, and duration of study selected fail to capture
the true causal intervals underlying the change process over time. For example, a change that is in fact continuous and gradual can appear in the results as
large in magnitude if the time interval (i.e., the interval between Timet and
Timet+1) is too large. The converse of the problem can also occur: A change
that is in fact large in magnitude would not be revealed in the results if the
time period selected for study is smaller than the true causal interval. The
time interval for repeated measurements can have dramatic effects on the
results of the analysis performed, including substantial changes in the magnitude of the effect sizes (e.g., Cohen, 1991; Collins, 1991; Gollob &
Reichardt, 1991). In organizational research, we almost never have a good
approximation of what the true causal interval is. Researchers have to make
some judgments when selecting time intervals and the time period in the
study based on some educated guess from theory and previous research
findings.
As in all data analysis, the application of any longitudinal technique has to
base the change analysis on adequate theoretical foundations. For example,
in latent growth analysis, it is almost always possible to get an empirically
good-fitting growth model simply by sequentially increasing the fit of the
model through a series of atheoretical nested models differing in the number
of freely estimated parameters in the error variance-covariance matrix. The
resulting atheoretical model would probably have little substantive meaning
and would probably not cross-validate in a different sample. When fitting
error structures, the researcher should, ideally, have a theory of error (e.g.,
specifying a particular form of method variance), model and test the hypothesized and alternative error structures, and provide convergent validity for the
theory by further modeling and testing relevant error structures using additional measures (e.g., including an additional measure of the hypothesized
method variance construct; see Chan, 2001, and Williams & Anderson,
1994). In short, the latent variable techniques described in this article, when
driven by adequate theory, design, and measurement, provide a unified
framework for addressing the different questions on change over time corresponding to various aspects of the longitudinal process of interest.
