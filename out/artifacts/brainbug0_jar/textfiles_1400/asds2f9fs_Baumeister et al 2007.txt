ABSTRACT—Psychology

calls itself the science of behavior,
and the American Psychological Association’s current
‘‘Decade of Behavior’’ was intended to increase awareness
and appreciation of this aspect of the science. Yet some
psychological subdisciplines have never directly studied
behavior, and studies on behavior are dwindling rapidly in
other subdisciplines. We discuss the eclipse of behavior in
personality and social psychology, in which direct observation of behavior has been increasingly supplanted by
introspective self-reports, hypothetical scenarios, and
questionnaire ratings. We advocate a renewed commitment to including direct observation of behavior whenever
possible and in at least a healthy minority of research
projects.
For decades now, psychology students have been taught from the
first day of class that psychology is the science of behavior and
that its ultimate goal is to describe and explain what people do.
Is that a fair description? The answer varies with the specific
area of psychology. Neuroscience and cognitive psychology have
never had much to say about the meaningful activities people
perform in their daily lives, nor have they really intended to.
These fields are more interested in understanding the internal
workings of the mind and brain rather than behavioral outcomes.
In contrast, animal learning and developmental psychology
have consistently focused on behavior, perhaps because
participants studied by these fields generally cannot fill out

questionnaires or read prompts on a computer screen, and
their studies have ranged from bar pressing as a function of
rewards to behavioral coordination between small children and
their parents.
The fields of social and personality psychology, however, offer
a special and discouraging case. Both of these related fields have
a mandate to study the important social behaviors that compose
the very texture of human life, with personality psychology focusing on individual differences in those behaviors and social
psychology exploring situational influences. But personality
psychology has long relied heavily on questionnaires in lieu of
behavioral observation, a state of affairs that has begun to
change only recently and ever so slowly, at that. Even worse,
social psychology has actually moved in the opposite direction.
At one time focused on direct observations of behaviors that
were both fascinating and important—a focus that attracted
many researchers to the field in the first place—social psychology has turned in recent years to the study of reaction times
and questionnaire responses. These techniques, which promised to help to explain behavior, appear instead to have largely
supplanted it. The result is that current research in social and
personality psychology pays remarkably little attention to the
important things that people do.
The 1990s was named the ‘‘Decade of the Brain’’ by the
American Psychological Association (APA). This widely-advertised rubric, promoted heavily by the APA, focused attention
on the importance of and advances in research on brain processes. It was wildly successful, to the extent that many funding
agencies jettisoned many other research priorities as they
poured money into expensive brain research and articles and
conference sessions on brain studies proliferated. Brain
researchers have always been more interested in brain and
nervous system functioning than in behavioral implications.

Ironically, however, their research has benefited hugely from the
conviction by funding agencies and the public at large that
anything a neuron does must be behaviorally important. Such
relevance has been demonstrated once in a great while (e.g., in
the work by Damasio, 1994, on the interaction between emotional and cognitive systems in decision making), but more often
it has merely been taken on faith. Meanwhile, the increase in
study of the brain has helped erode interest in the actual observation of behavior.
It seemed an extremely wise move therefore when, impressed
by the success of the brain decade, APA came up with the idea of
making the first decade of the new century ‘‘The Decade of
Behavior.’’ The goal was to focus attention on the contributions
of psychology toward understanding and affecting important
behaviors and consequent life outcomes, thereby adding relevance, credibility, and (one hoped) big research budgets to the
enterprise. This emphasis was—or at least should have been—
especially welcome to social and personality psychologists,
whose research programs would seem to be in a position to
benefit greatly from a renewed recognition of the importance of
behavior.
It is now past halfway through the putative Decade of Behavior
and is therefore a fair time to ask, ‘‘How’s it going?’’ In particular,
how are social and personality psychologists doing? To anticipate our answer, we think they are doing fine in many respects—
but not in respect to studying behavior.
LOOKING FOR BEHAVIOR

With that question in mind, we picked up a recent (January
2006) issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
(JPSP), by consensus the premier journal in our subdisciplines
(we are all social and personality psychologists). It is undeniably
a fine issue, offering important advances in the topics the articles address. The methods are rigorous, and the discussions are
thoughtful. The editors, reviewers, and authors did their jobs
well.
But behavior is hard to find. Or if it is there, it is rather
different than what we had imagined it to be. If this issue offers a
representative sample, then human behavior is almost always
performed in a seated position, usually seated in front of a
computer. Finger movements, as in keystrokes and pencil
marks, constitute the vast majority of human action.
In fact, a remarkable amount of ‘‘behavior’’ turns out to be
really just marks on a self-report questionnaire. Sometimes
these questionnaires ask people to report what they have done,
will do, or would do. More often, they ask people to report what
they think, how they feel, or why they do what they do. In other
words, most personality and social psychological studies gather
self-reports of inner states.
Nisbett and Wilson (1977) thought they had discredited introspection back in the 1970s, when they demonstrated that the
factors that drive behavior are often invisible to the people who

Volume 2—Number 4

perform it. As their title expressed, most introspective reporting
involves ‘‘telling more than we can know.’’ Although aspects of
this research became controversial, it is abundantly clear from
their studies, other research, and everyday observation that
people have not always done what they say they have done, will
not always do what they say they will do, and often do not even
know the real causes of the things they do. These discrepancies
mean that self-reports of past behaviors, hypothetical future
behaviors, or causes of behavior are not necessarily accurate.1
Nonetheless, self-report appears to have all but crowded out
all other forms of behavior. Behavioral science today, at least as
represented in JPSP, mostly involves asking people to report on
their thoughts, feelings, memories, and attitudes. Occasionally
they are asked to report on recent or hypothetical actions. Or,
somewhat differently (and more rarely), reaction times, implicit
associations, or memory recall might be assessed in the service
of illuminating a cognitive process. But that is as close as most
research gets. Direct observation of meaningful behavior is
apparently passé.
This is certainly quite an ironic turnabout from Nisbett and
Wilson’s (1977) critical stance. In fact, Wilson’s more recent
work has shown that when people introspect to analyze the
reasons for their actions, they often mislead themselves (Wilson,
2002). In a choice rhetorical flourish, he advises people who
seek self-knowledge to eschew direct inspection and instead
consult books on social psychology. Yet the books on social
psychology are increasingly based on research that itself is
heavily based on introspection.
The move from behavior to an emphasis on introspective selfreport and hypothetical responses to imagined events is potentially a hugely important shift in the very nature of psychology.
Psychological science started out in the 1800s with introspection (e.g., Wundt, 1894). One major development of the 20th
century was the shift from introspection to direct observation
of behavior, widely regarded as an advance in the development
of scientific methodology. Did someone, somewhere, decide that
that had been a mistake and that we should now go back to introspection?
Let’s take a closer look at this recent issue of JPSP, which
was chosen only for convenience and is presumably representative. It contains 11 articles reporting 38 studies. The closest
thing to direct observation of behavior in the dependent measures of any of these studies was a participant making a decision.
That is, one study asked participants to choose between two
stimulus persons (who were made known to participants via
photographs) to give them the postexperimental interview. Apart
from that borderline case, not a single one of those 38 studies
contained direct observation of behavior. The dependent measures consisted entirely of ratings, either on paper question-

1

This does not mean they are never accurate, but rather that there is no way to
know whether they are accurate or not without direct observation of behavior.

397

<-----Page 2----->Eclipse of Behavior

naires or computer-administered stimuli. The ratings were
mainly introspective self-reports.
Some of the procedures included hints of behavior along the
way. One study had participants read a fictional police report
about a violent act and express a (nonbinding) opinion as to the
appropriate prison sentence for the perpetrator. (So at least they
read about someone else’s behavior, albeit fictional behavior.)
Four studies had participants take tests: one for the purpose of
legitimizing bogus feedback, the other three as a basis for assessing the accuracy of self-ratings of performance. Some of the
questionnaires asked people to report on their past behaviors.
Several asked people to read things, such as descriptions of
hypothetical behavior. One study had participants cross out all
instances of the letter e in a page of printed text.
So that is behavior today in the leading journal of social and
personality psychology: ratings and more ratings, occasionally
making a choice, reading and taking a test, and crossing out
the letter e.
Behavior fared only slightly better in the previous issue: Out
of 38 studies in 13 articles, there was one that measured negotiation moves (Bowles, Babcock, & McGinn, 2005) and one that
studied ‘‘how an individual actually behaves during an induced
conflict’’ (quoted from Knee, Lonsbary, Canevello, & Patrick,
2005, p. 998). Note the authors’ use of the term ‘‘actually,’’ which
illustrates their awareness of how unusual it was to observe
behavior directly.2 That study induced and videotaped a disagreement between romantic partners and then coded for understanding versus defensive behaviors (mainly speech acts;
Knee et al., 2005). Those two studies are about real behavior, but
again they are only 2 out of 38 studies. One additional study
included a behavioral independent variable (of sorts) that consisted of people reading their e-mail message aloud before
sending it (as opposed to just sending it; Kruger, Epley, Parker,
& Ng, 2005). There was also a study that used a questionnaire for
self-report of behavior.
We do not doubt that other surveys would yield similar
numbers. Social and personality psychologists do not report
much actual behavior in their premier journal or elsewhere.
WAS IT ALWAYS THUS?

Our impression is that this trend has been building for a while.
In what psychologists from the baby-boom generation may remember as a golden age, social psychology for a time was
characterized by studies that directly observed important behaviors in vividly evocative contexts (see Aronson, Brewer, &
Carlsmith, 1985). We suspect that more than one social psychologist was inspired onto his or her career by an undergraduate class lecture on John Darley’s and Bibb Latané’s studies
of bystander intervention (e.g., Darley & Latané, 1968) or on

Since we wrote this, we have noticed the increasing frequency with which
behavior is called ‘‘actual behavior,’’ presumably to distinguish from the other,
more commonly studied kinds or perhaps just to dramatize its rarity.

398

Stanley Milgram’s (1975) obedience studies, which put real
people into emotionally powerful situations and then watched
what they did. Even many classic studies of inner variables such
as attitudes and guilt contained dramatic behavioral experiences prior to the self-reporting of inner states (e.g., Aronson &
Mills, 1959; Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959). Studies like this
faded from view, however, when the field embraced the cognitive
revolution in the 1980s, and the success (and apparent rigor and
prestige, see Rozin, 2001) of cognitively-framed studies may
have encouraged many researchers to concentrate on the selfreport measures that were appropriate for those studies rather
than struggle for difficult and expensive behavioral observation.
The impressively successful Decade of the Brain, as we have
already noted, also demonstrated to researchers the success,
prestige, and funding that could accrue to studies exploring
inner psychological processes while postponing, perhaps
indefinitely, examination of the behavioral results of these
processes.
In personality psychology, meanwhile, the interest in behavior
was weaker all along in some ways, especially given the core
emphasis on measurement of traits, for which self-report has
long been the prominent method. Although sophisticated psychometric methods have been developed, the primary method
for validating a personality questionnaire is still to demonstrate
how it correlates with other questionnaires (Funder, 2001).
Hundreds of studies on the ‘‘structure of personality’’ seek that
structure amongst the correlations between questionnaires. One
major recent project that aimed to compare the utility of several
major personality inventories in their ability to predict behavior
did so by seeing how well each one predicted self-reports of
behavior (in other words, yet another questionnaire). Even
personality psychologists who evince skepticism about personality traits are not immune; their research, too, is based almost
exclusively on self-reports or hypothetical predictions, with only
rare (and therefore highly notable) exceptions (e.g., Wright &
Mischel, 1987). In recent years, a few personality psychologists
have begun to look again at behavior in the laboratory (e.g.,
Borkenau, Riemann, Angleitner, & Spinath, 2001), assess behavioral residue (e.g., the condition of a student’s dorm room or
a worker’s office cubicle; see, Gosling, Kos, Mannarelli, &
Morris, 2002), and develop methods to code directly observed
behavior along meaningful dimensions (e.g., the Riverside Behavioral Q-sort; Funder, Furr, & Colvin, 2000). These efforts
remain rare, however, and have not been particularly influential
so far. The dominant method throughout personality psychology,
to this day, is the questionnaire (Funder, 2001).
We were moved by these questions and reflections to take a
slightly more systematic and quantified look at behavior in JPSP
over the decades. Two of the authors went to libraries and selected issues from 1966, 1976, 1986, 1996, and 2006 for coding.
We used our birth months (March and May) for each year, and
we coded all studies reported in the issue as to whether they
included any direct observation of behavior. Coding was

Volume 2—Number 4

<-----Page 3----->Roy F. Baumeister, Kathleen D. Vohs, and David C. Funder

deliberately liberal, such that a study qualified as having behavior if any element involved behavior—that is, if the study
used any manipulation, any dependent measure, or even used
behavior as the conduit for manipulating the independent
variable (e.g., taking a test and getting feedback on it). Hence,
each study in each paper had a score of 0 (no behavior) or 1 (one
or more behavioral element). Some articles were not included
in the final tally because there were no empirical data reported,
such as in conceptual or statistical papers or commentaries.
Self-reports of past behaviors or of hypothetical behaviors did
not count. The use of archival behavioral data (e.g., crime statistics; donating blood) qualified. Reading about someone else’s
behavior was not counted as behavior.
The two issues for each same year furnished quite similar
numbers except for 1966, in which the very young journal had
several peculiar features (including mostly one-study papers
and some short reports, one of which oddly reported four brief
and very similar studies that were ultimately counted as one),
and so we coded two additional issues for that year to furnish a
broader base; in addition, one of the originally coded issues was
lost because of catastrophic computer failure. In all, we coded
304 studies across the 11 issues of JPSP.
Figure 1 shows the results of this coding. Back in 1966, when
most articles contained only a single study, about half of these
involved actual behavior. The study of behavior increased its
share of the journal into the 1970s. But the use and study of
behavior dropped sharply in 1986, and the subsequent decades
have seen a continued downward trend. Apparently, the study of
behavior has been in a steady decline since the early 1980s.
CAVEAT

We want to be very clear that we see nothing wrong with what
social and personality psychologists are doing, as far as it goes.

WONDERING WHY

There are probably many reasons for the sorry state of behavioral
study during these last few years of the Decade of Behavior. For
example, sometimes direct behavioral observations are unethical, unfeasible, or impossible. For the foreseeable future, most
studies of everyday behaviors ranging from eating to sexual
behavior and from exercise habits to drug use will have to rely
primarily on self-report despite the obvious disadvantages.
Moreover, if one wants to know what a participant is thinking or
feeling, there is little alternative but to ask. And even under the
best of circumstances, observing actual social behavior is more
difficult, challenging, and inconvenient than just asking for
ratings or sitting a participant in front of a computer screen and
measuring his or her keystrokes or reaction times. The field is
highly competitive, and the top journals require multiple studies, so the struggle to observe behavior, even when it would be
possible, may well make it harder to crank out the volume of data
that academic success now requires. Moreover, the sad fact is
that many studies fail to show meaningful significant differences. A failed behavioral study is an expensive failure and
could even be a major career setback. Last, and perhaps most
centrally, journals do not seem to give extra points or consideration to studies that observe behavior instead of just getting
ratings, so why bother?3
Our data on JPSP across the years points to the early 1980s as
the beginning of a huge decline for observed behavior in studies.
Several things had changed in the journal between 1976 and

Self-reports of behavior, emotion, intention, and thoughts
are often illuminating, may be the appropriate method for
certain topics (e.g., studies of attitudes or emotional experience), and sometimes are all that is possible. Such measures can
and do lead to important and interesting knowledge that will
advance theory. But the restriction of methods also serves to
constrain the topics that are addressed in the first place (Rozin,
2001). In other words, our chief complaint is with what social
and personality psychologists, and perhaps others in the field,
are not doing.
Surely some important behavior involves standing up?
Or actually talking to another live person, even beyond
getting instructions about how to sign a consent form and
activate the computer program? Whatever happened to helping, hurting, playing, working, taking, eating, risking, waiting,
flirting, goofing off, showing off, giving up, screwing up,
compromising, selling, persevering, pleading, tricking, outhustling, sandbagging, refusing, and the rest? Can’t psychology find ways to observe and explain these acts, at least once
in a while?

One of the authors of this article, in his previous capacities as Associate
Editor of one personality journal and as Editor of another, did follow an (unadvertised) policy of trying very hard to accept any article that included any
direct measurement of behavior, but he received very few such submissions.

1986. First, the journal had been split into three sections, and
they were allocated in ways that might be taken as at best indifferent to behavior. Second, editorial policy changed toward
explicitly favoring articles with multiple studies, and as we have
suggested, it is far easier to do many studies by seating groups in
front of computers or questionnaires than to measure behavior
over and over. To be sure, other trends in the field at that time
may also have contributed. These would include the cognitive
revolution (itself a strong push to focus on inner process and
downplay so-called actual behavior) and the steady increase in
restrictive Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).
IRBs may be more likely to raise objections to behavioral
measures than to ratings. From an IRB perspective, it seems far
less intrusive to ask someone what she would eat than to observe
how much she actually eats.4 The problem is, of course, that
hypothetical behavioral responses may be wildly inaccurate,
and in any case, there is no way to know unless actual behavior is
also measured. In a similar vein, it may seem less intrusive to
measure ‘‘prejudice’’ as indicated by speed of key presses in
response to prompts on a computer screen than to actually see
how a person interacts with a person against whom he or she
might or might not be biased. And it is certainly easier. But, as
psychologists bow to pressure from the IRBs to avoid anything
that might have the remotest chance of slightly upsetting their
research participants and to competitive pressures to produce
lots of studies per paper, they sacrifice the scientific quality of
the discipline. Not to mention abandoning its original goal of
being the science of behavior.
Ratings, reaction times, and similar measures are surely
necessary. The maturation of the field has required a great rise of
interest in inner process. In the 1960s, a researcher could manipulate independent variables, measure behavior, and simply
speculate about the internal mediating process. Now the researcher is required to demonstrate the inner process as well.
Adding ratings surely made for better science. But in principle,
the ratings and self-reports were supposed to shed light on the
behavior, not replace it.
To put it another way: Once upon a time, perhaps, psychologists observed behavior and reported what they saw, along
with their theories about why it happened. The emergence of
competing theories, and therefore competing explanations, led
psychologists to push each other to show what happened inside
the person to produce the behavior. Gradually the focus shifted
on these debates about inner processes, and journals started
publishing studies that made significant contributions about
demonstrating inner processes. Somewhere along the way, it
became acceptable to publish data on inner processes without

One of the authors of this article spent part of her career studying how much
ice cream dieters and nondieters would eat under different conditions. One
university’s IRB feared that measuring eating behavior—namely, having to
admit to participants that their eating was being recorded—might cause dieters
to go into a tailspin and develop disordered eating habits.

any real behavior included at all, which eventually became
the norm.
WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?

One might ask, ‘‘Is there anything wrong with learning about
inner process?’’ We think not. But behavior matters too. It
cannot be blithely assumed that responding to questionnaires
is enough to tell us all we need to know about actual life. It is
necessary to study actual behavior sometimes. For example,
West and Brown (1975) conducted the same experiment two
different ways: once by asking people what they would do in this
situation, and once by actually staging the event. The experiment involved an ostensible accident victim standing on the
street, asking passersby for money to help pay for medical care
at a nearby clinic. Actual and hypothetical behavior differed in
two major ways. First, the levels of help were dramatically
different. Asked how they would react to such a request, participants said they would give fairly generously, but when the
experiment was conducted live, actual donations averaged
barely over 10 cents in some conditions.
The other difference is even more important for psychology’s
goal of building sound theories about behavior. The victim’s
attractiveness did not have a significant effect on hypothetical
donations, but it did have a significant effect on real donations.
This occurred despite the lower overall generosity in actual
behavior (hence, overcoming any possible floor effect). A researcher who followed the common contemporary method of
relying solely on hypothetical behavior would draw a false
conclusion that would omit an important and significant contributor to actual behavior.
In recent years, the reasons for doubting self-reports and the
resulting need to observe actual behavior have increased.
Affective forecasting studies systematically show the inaccuracies of people’s predictions about how they will react and feel
(e.g., Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). Studies on judgment and decision making have likewise shown that people’s predictions are
inaccurate and that hypothetical decisions do not reliably match
actual ones. For example, in hypothetical decisions, people are
moderately risk averse regardless of the amount of money they
imagine is at stake, but when actual money is used, people
become dramatically more risk averse as amounts increase (Holt
& Laury, 2002).
This issue has arisen before. During the 1960s and 1970s,
both personality traits and attitudes came under vigorous attack
on precisely these grounds. Mischel (1968) wrote a famous and
influential critique arguing that personality trait measures seldom have appreciable correlations with measures of actual behavior. Wicker (1969) went so far as to suggest that attitudes,
which had been touted by Gordon Allport as social psychology’s
most important concept, should be abandoned. The fields responded with impressive programs designed to show that, yes,
one could predict some of the people’s behavior some of the time

Volume 2—Number 4

<-----Page 5----->Roy F. Baumeister, Kathleen D. Vohs, and David C. Funder

from attitudes and trait scales (e.g., Ajzen, 2000; Glasman &
Albarracı́n, 2006, Kenrick & Funder, 1988).
The issues remain today, and indeed the question of attitude–
behavior consistency and behavioral predictability remain important research topics. But in a recent class devoted to examining articles published in JPSP, the students were surprised to
find that the latest article on attitude–behavior consistency did
not bother measuring behavior—it asked participants to imagine what they might do in hypothetical situations. Similarly, we
have already mentioned how at least one study has sought to
assess the predictive validity of personality trait questionnaires
via their correlations with a measure of behavior that was itself
a questionnaire. This hardly seems fair. Social psychologists
cannot claim that attitudes or personality predict behavior if by
behavior they do not really mean behavior.
The problem goes even deeper. Although self-reports, reaction times, implicit associations, and the like are good and even
ideal methods for examining certain topics, we believe that
psychology has tilted towards examining precisely those topics
for which these methods are appropriate and away from everything else (Rozin, 2001). This leads us to wonder, in the rush to
test competing theories of internal processes as our discipline
moves away from the description of important behavioral phenomena, what goes missing? What questions are researchers
forgetting to even ask? A partial list is not difficult to generate:
 How do people with different degrees of a personality trait
behave differently?
 How do situational variables such as physical aspects, social
relationships, and cultural structures affect what people do?
 How do prejudiced individuals actually treat the objects of
their prejudice?
 How do those who have been discriminated against respond
behaviorally?
 How and when do women and men act differently in situations
ranging from the first date to leading a meeting?
The reader is invited to make his or her own additions to this
list—it is not difficult to do. Again, our point is not that topics
like these are or never were addressed (e.g., see Nisbett &
Cohen, 1996, for fascinating studies of the relationship between
culture and aggressive behavior), but that they are neglected
relative to the study of cognitive process and certainly relative to
their intrinsic importance. This is why APA’s Decade of Behavior
risks becoming a laughingstock for those in social and personality psychology, the fields that should benefit the most from
this initiative.
Also, it is very possible that the abandonment of behavior
could be seriously detrimental to the field’s goals and broad
influence. A recent president of the Society for Personality and
Social Psychology articulated in the society newsletter that
these fields are suffering from failing to get their message across
to outsiders. They are seen as not making much interesting
progress, even though insiders know that the conferences and

Volume 2—Number 4

journals are filled with exciting new work. But perhaps scholars
in other fields and even undergraduates find it difficult to appreciate the excitement of the work when it rests on correlations
among questionnaire items or significant differences in reaction
times. The dramatic behaviors of the early years of social psychology experiments are still featured in the textbooks, and
probably for good reason.
TODAY’S DILEMMA

Ironically, psychologists who study behavior today find themselves at a disadvantage. Everyone would probably agree that
the ideal paper would report both direct observation of behavior
and measurement of inner processes that mediate and produce
those behaviors. But if you only have one without the other,
preferences are lopsided. Data on behavior without inner process are regarded as unpublishable by most journals. Grant
reviewers often behave similarly. One of the present authors
submitted a grant proposal for a behavioral study that a reviewer
criticized on the grounds that it did not include ‘‘psychological
variables,’’ apparently meaning internal process measures.5 By
this definition, behavior is not even a psychological variable!
Behavior by itself is regarded as only a beginning, an unsolved
puzzle. Meanwhile, however, a study of inner process without
behavior is acceptable.
When confronted with a study reporting behavior but not inner
process, reviewers will immediately ask, why did this happen?
Researchers need to show what goes on inside. But when confronted with a study reporting inner process but no overt behavior, reviewers almost never ask, ‘‘Would this actually alter
behavior?’’ Inner process is considered interesting and important in its own right, without any proof that it has any implications for what people do.
Given those unequal contingencies, it is not surprising that
researchers have turned away from behavior. It is apparently
more trouble than it is worth. Ratings are the keys to success,
and they are publishable with or without behavior. Behavior,
meanwhile, is not publishable by itself without ratings, and
moreover, behavior often has a nasty way of complicating the
cleaner, more elegant picture that one can get from ratings alone.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR ACTION?

We wish to suggest, gently and respectfully,6 that social and
personality psychology try to put a bit more behavior back into
the science of behavior (as psychology still advertises itself).
There is no need to stop asking for ratings or analyzing reaction
times, but perhaps psychologists could all push themselves to
include an occasional study that includes direct observation
5
This is not just sour grapes; the study was funded despite a negative review,
which is itself an unusual outcome.

Any attentive reader can tell by now that we are nothing if not gentle and
respectful.

of what Knee et al. (2005) poignantly called ‘‘actual behavior.’’
To be sure, behavioral observation is not always ethical or feasible, as we have mentioned. But when it is, why not include it?
Researchers could put a bit more effort into developing methods
for observing behavior directly (e.g., Furr & Funder, 2007). We
could do more to build on efforts such as the behavioral batteries
for personality assessment designed by Jack and Jeanne Block
(Block, 1993), the behavior-sampling technologies pioneered by
Matthias Mehl and his colleagues (Mehl, Gosling, & Pennebaker, 2006), behavioral observations in real life such as those
used by James Dabbs, Chris Fraley, and their colleagues (Dabbs,
Hargrove, & Heusel, 1996; Fraley & Shaver, 1998), work on
performance as a function of approach–avoidance frames
by Andrew Elliot and Carol Dweck (e.g., Elliott & Dweck, 1988),
self-regulation work by Baumeister and colleagues (e.g.,
Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998; Vohs,
Baumeister, & Ciarocco, 2005), the studies on eating behavior
by Heatherton and colleagues (Heatherton, Herman, & Polivy,
1991; Vohs & Heatherton, 2000), and speech-sampling methods
such as those developed by Lisa Feldman Barrett, James
Pennebaker, Lisa Fast, and their colleagues (Fast & Funder, in
press; Feldman Barrett, Williams, & Fong, 2002; Pennebaker,
Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003).
Perhaps reviewers, editors, and granting agencies could even
give a little extra preference to studies that contain behavior, in
the spirit of affirmative action for the promotion of methodological diversity. If others share our view that the current system discourages scientists from observing behavior, then
perhaps more vigorous changes can be made to redress the
imbalance. Maybe a new section of JPSP could be earmarked for
studies of behavior. Or perhaps one of the new journals that the
Association for Psychological Science is introducing could be
devoted to behavioral work. Having such a devoted outlet would
reduce the (apparently crippling) demand that behavioral
studies must compete for space with the easier-to-conduct, and
therefore correspondingly more rigorous and plentiful, studies
that use only ratings.
Let us stress that we are not criticizing APA’s initiative on the
Decade of Behavior. We support the goal wholeheartedly. But if
social and personality psychology has given up on behavior, how
can the field expect society as a whole to embrace it? In fact,
even if society (or funding agencies at least) were to embrace the
Decade of Behavior idea, would that benefit the field? The
saddest outcome would be for the powerful and fund-granting
authorities to decide that behavior is important after all and then
to use that as a reason to disrespect the field. They might say, and
not without reason, ‘‘We want to support the study of human
behavior, but personality and social psychologists don’t study
behavior.’’
