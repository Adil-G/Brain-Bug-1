TRUST AND DISTRUST: NEW RELATIONSHIPS
AND REALITIES

We propose a new theoretical framework for understanding simultaneous trust and
distrust within relationships, grounded in assumptions of multidimensionality and
the inherent tensions of relationships, and we separate this research from prior work
grounded in assumptions of unidimensionality and balance. Drawing foundational
support for this new framework from recent research on simultaneous positive and
negative sentiments and ambivalence, we explore the theoretical and practical significance of the framework for future work on trust and distrust relationships within
organizations.

the uncertainty, complexity, and change that
punctuate todoy's fast-paced global business
environment (D'Aveni, 1994; Hamel & Prahalad, 1994) and the resulting strategic impact
of trust and distrust relationships on competitiveness. Given the competitive requirements
of speed (Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995) and quality (Schneider & Bowen, 1995), coordinated action in strategic initiatives (such as quality
improvement, customer service, and new product development) has become essential. Also,
given the competitive challenges of organizational growth, globalization, and expansion
through strategic alliances, the ability to effectively develop and maintain strategic partnerships and alliances among competitors
(Hamel & Prahalad, 1994) and multicultural/
multilingual relations (Cox & Tung, 1997) has
become a critical competence. In all of these
arenas, the trusting qualities of the relations
between parties-through cross-functional
teams, temporary groups, strategic alliances,
and socially embedded partnerships-are critical for successful collaboration (Sheppard,
1995).
The key role played by trust as a foundation
for effective collaboration emphasizes, in no
small way, our recognition of the multiple and
mixed motives that shape collaborative behavior. Yet, while incentives to collaborate and trust
certainly exist, there are simultaneous reasons
to distrust relationship partners (Brandenburger

The view of trust as a foundation for social
order spans many intellectual disciplines and
levels of analysis. Understanding why people
trust, as well as how that trust shapes social
relations, has been a central focus for psychologists (Deutsch, 1962; WorcheL 1979), sociologists (Gambetta, 1988), political scientists
(Barber, 1983), economists (Axelrod, 1984), anthropologists (Ekeh, 1974), and students of organizational behavior (Kramer & Tyler, 1996). Scholars have seen trust as an essential ingredient in
the healthy personality (Erikson, 1963; Shaver &
Hazan, 1994), as a foundation for interpersonal
relationships (Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985),
as a foundation for cooperation (Barnard, 1938;
Blau, 1964), and as the basis for stability in
social institutions and markets (Arrow, 1974;
Williamson, 1974; Zucker, 1986).
Recently, researchers of trust within organizations have focused on understanding the efficiencies of trust and explaining its emergence (Hosmer, 1995; Kramer & Tyler, 1996;
Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993). We are increasingly recognizing

& Nalebuff, 1996). The challenges of speed, quality, and global reach, which require trust, also
have precipitated distrust, through corporate restructuring, downsizing, and fundamental violations of the psychological contracts connecting
individuals with organizations (Heckscher, 1995;
Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Rousseau, 1995).
Bringing these conditions together, we see that
the challenges of the modern global marketplace center on the simultaneous management
of trust and distrust in a hostile environment in
which individuals may be just as inclined to
distrust as they are to trust.
In this article we bring the opportunities forand challenges of-managing trust and distrust
into focus, introducing a new theoretical framework for understanding simultaneous trust and
distrust relations wi thin organizations. We
ground this framework in assumptions of multidimensionality and the inherent tensions of
complex relationships, supplanting older assumptions of relationship unidimensionality
and balance. We construct this new framework
on a foundation of current research, arguing for
the existence of simultaneous positive and negative sentiments and ambivalence, and we explore the theoretical and practical significance
of this framework for future work on trust and
distrust relationships within organizations.

DEFINING TRUST AND DISTRUST
Systematic research on trust in organizations
now spans more than 40 years. In early research
scholars associated trust and distrust with individuals' expressions of confidence in others'
intentions and motives (Deutsch, 1958, 1960;
Mellinger, 1956; Read, 1962). Mellinger (1956), for
instance, defined trust as an individual's confidence in another person's intentions and motives, and the sincerity of that person's word.
Read (1962) built on Mellinger's understanding
of trust, arguing that trusting individuals expect
their interests to be protected and promoted by
those they trust, feel confident about disclosing
negative personal information, feel assured of
full and frank information sharing, and are prepared to overlook apparent breaches of the trust
relationship. Deutsch (1960) saw trust as an individual's confidence in the intentions and capabilities of a relationship partner and the belief that a relationship partner would behave as
one hoped. Likewise, Deutsch viewed suspicion

439

or distrust as confidence about a relationship
partner's undesirable behavior, stemming from
knowledge of the individual's capabilities and
intentions.
In contrast to the emphasis on intentions and
motives of early research, the focus of researchers more recently is on behavior (Hosmer, 1995;
Mayer et al., 1995), where trust is defined as one
party's optimistic expectation of the behavior of
another, when the party must make a decision
about how to act (under conditions of vulnerability and dependence; Hosmer, 1995), and as
"the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to
the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective
of the ability to monitor or control that other
party" (Mayer et al., 1995: 712). In reciprocal
terms, scholars understand distrust to be the
expectation that others will not act in one's best
interests, even engaging in potentially injurious
behavior (Govier, 1994), and the expectation that
capable and responsible behavior from specific
individuals will not be forthcoming (Barber,
1983). Thus, distrust is viewed as the opposite of
trust, and both trust and distrust are understood
in behavioral terms, with little attention given to
the confidences, intentions, and motives that
promote trusting/distrusting and trustworthy/
untrustworthy behavior.
In our analysis we define trust in terms of
confident positive expectations regarding another's conduct, and distrust in terms of confident negative expectations regarding another's
conduct. We use the term "another's conduct" in
a very specific, but encompassing, sense, addressing another's words, actions, and decisions
(what another says and does and how he or she
makes decisions). By "confident positive expectations," we mean a belief in, a propensity to
attribute virtuous intentions to, and a willingness to act on the basis of another's conduct.
Conversely, by "confident negative expectations," we mean a fear of, a propensity to attribute sinister intentions to, and "a desire to
buffer oneself from the effects of another's conduct. We assert that both trust and distrust involve movements toward certainty: trust concerning expectations of things hoped for and
distrust concerning expectations of things
feared.
We argue that trust and distrust are separate
but linked dimensions. Moreover, we propose

<-----Page 3----->440

Academy of Management Review

that trust and distrust are not opposite ends of a
single continuum. There are elements that contribute to the growth and decline of trust, and
there are elements that contribute to the growth
and decline of distrust. These elements grow
and develop through an individual's experiences with another in the various facet-specific
transactions of multiplex relations. Although
broad, generalized inferences across the links
may occur (i.e., strong levels of trust in some
elements may generalize to create lower levels
of distrust in others, and vice versa), it is possible for parties to both trust and distrust one
another, given different experiences within the
various facets of complex interpersonal relationships.
Two-factor models are not unheard of in the
organization sciences (Herzberg, Mausner, &
Snyderman, 1967). We draw the intellectual
foundations for our work from Luhmann's (1979)
articulation of trust and distrust as distinct but
potentially coexistent mechanisms for managing complexity. The empirical foundations for
our work are drawn from recent social psychological research on the separability of positivevalent and negative-valent attitudes (Cacioppo
& Berntson, 1994) and research on conditions of
ambivalence under which positive-valent and
negative-valent attitudes can coexist. Inasmuch
as expectations of benefit and harm (Nucci,
Stapleton, & Tedeschi, 1973), pro-Black and antiBlack sentiments (Katz & Hess. 1988), and love
and hate sentiments have been shown to coexist
(Coser, 1956; Freud, 1918), simultaneous trust
and distrust appear possible (Priester & Petty,
1996).
Within the scope of trust research, our conceptualization corresponds better with earlier foundational work on trust (Deutsch, 1958; Mellinger,
1956; Read, 1962) than with more recent perspectives (Hosmer, 1995; Mayer et al., 1995). Our understanding of the relationship between trust
and distrust represents a clear break with much
of the management literature on trust in organizations, for in management scholarship, the understanding of relationships has driven the understanding of the dynamics of trust and
distrust. We argue that old views of relationships are untenable and that a contemporary
perspective on social relationships must allow
for simultaneous trust and distrust.

TRUST-DISTRUST DYNAMICS AND
RELATIONSHIP REALITIES
Old View of Trust, Distrust, and Relationships
Upon reviewing the spectrum of research on
trust in the organizational sciences, we marvel
at the breadth of theoretical and empirical approaches informing current theory and practice.
Personality theory, behavioral decision theory,
social psychology, and sociological theoryeach of these traditions has been drawn upon to
some extent. Although reviewers of this literature have emphasized the important distinctions
among these approaches (Ross & LaCroix, 1996;
Sitkiri & Roth, 1993), we recognize converging
themes: the characterization of trust and distrust
as separate and opposite constructs, the normative view of trust as "good" and distrust as
"bad," and limited emphasis on social context.
Furthermore, this existing research has proceeded from a perspective on relationships that
emphasizes relationship unidimensionality and
governing norms of balance and consistency.
Trust and distrust as one bipolar construct.
Across intellectual traditions, scholars consider
trust and distrust separate and opposite. For
personality researchers who view trust as an
individual difference, trust and distrust exist at
opposite ends of a single trust-distrust continuum (Rotter, 1971), and they generally view low
trust expectations as indicative of high distrust
(Stack, 1988; Tardy, 1988). Behavioral decision
theorists, examining trust and distrust from a
rational choice perspective, define trust as cooperative conduct and distrust as noncooperative conduct in mixed-motive game situations
(Arrow, 1974; Axelrod, 1984; Coleman, 1990;
Miller, 1992). For social psychologists, conflicting psychological states characterized by simultaneous trust and distrust are unstable and transitory in nature (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995; Lewis &
Weigert, 1985). Sociologists, while recognizing
the importance of trust and distrust as mechanisms for reducing social complexity and uncertainty (Lewis & Weigert, 1985), view them as
functional equivalents or substitutes. Up to this
point, no systematic effort has been made to
address the potential for simultaneous trust and
distrust within organizational settings.
Normative view of trust and distrust. Across
intellectual traditions, scholars view trust as
"good" and distrust as "bad." The focus of attention for personality researchers has been on un-

<-----Page 4----->1998

Lewicki, McAllister and Hies

derstanding distrust as a psychological disorder
to be corrected (Erikson, 1963). Research from the
behavioral decision theory perspective has
been sparked by researchers' desire to solve
intractable conflict situations and to promote
effective collaboration characterized by trust
(Axelrod, 1984). Similarly, within social-psychological and sociological traditions, trust has
been seen as a necessary ingredient for social
order and the research focus has been on understanding its emergence and development (Barber, 1983; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Luhmann, 1979;
Shapiro, 1987). Organizational scientists have
yet to give systematic attention to the limits of
trust and the functions of distrust.
Limited attention to social context and relationship dynamics. Finally, across intellectual
traditions, scholars have given limited attention
to the role of social context. Personality researchers assume the foundational nature of
trust transcends context (Johnson-George &
Swap, 1982; Rotter, 1971; Stack, 1988). Within behavioral decision theory, the "qcrne environment" is devoid of real context information, and
the incentive structure in place predetermines
behavior (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982; Lewis
& Weigert, 1985; Pearce, 1974; Tardy, 1988).
Within the social-psychological tradition, researchers acknowledge contextual differences
but view the "organizational" context as an
overarching condition that limits the relevance
of the social/emotional/relational element of
trust relationships (Gabarro, 1990; McAllister,
1995). And within the sociological tradition,
scholars place emphasis on those social institutions that transcend and/or precede conscious
awareness and predispose people to behave in
characteristic ways (Garfinkel, 1973; Zucker,
1986). We need further recognition of the role of
social context.
Relationships as unidimensional constructs.
For the most part, researchers have considered
interpersonal relationships within organizations unidimensional, with a single component
or dimension of the relationship (such as taskrelated interaction) determining the quality of
the entire relationship. For example, assume
that two academic colleagues, A and B, work
together on a research article. A agrees to do the
data analysis, and B agrees to write the first
draft; thus, to do the job well, B is dependent on
A's performance. Most theories of trust assume
that if A is not always reliable in his or her task

l

441

performance (e.g., he or she is overcommitted
and cannot find the time to complete the analyses or does a careless job), B will come to completely distrust A. This assumption-in our
view, usually unstated but pervasive in the literature (e.g., Gabarro, 1990)-is based on the
logic that B's "overall" trust level for A is wholly
determined by their interdependence around
this writing task. If B determines that A cannot
be trusted with the writing task, B also cannot
trust A in any other context or relational interdependency.
We can attribute pervasiveness of this assumption of unidimensionality in trust research,
especially as it concerns the field of organizational behavior, to the fact that our understanding of relationships is still in its infancy (Greenhalgh, 1995; Greenhalgh & Chapman, 1994;
McAllister, 1995; Sheppard, 1995; Valley, Neale,
& Mannix, 1995). With only a limited "language
of relationships" and a limited framework for
describing the key parameters of relationships
across contexts, it is not surprising that in many
research streams, relationship variables are often selected for research emphasis without
much attention to the broader framework in
which they operate and interact (Greenhalgh,
1995; Greenhalgh & Chapman, 1994).
Relationship homeostasis driven by balance
and consistency. We also note that the traditional view of relationships, which has shaped
our understanding of the simplistic social context of trust relationships, is one that emphasizes the emergence and maintenance of balance and consistency. The principles of balance
and consistency in interpersonal behavior are
among the oldest in social psychology and are
grounded, first and foremost, in a Lewinian perspective on human behavior (Deutsch, 1968).
Within this tradition, psychological imbalance
is an aversive condition that social actors seek
to resolve or minimize (Barker, Dembo, & Lewin,
1941; Deutsch, 1968; Festinger, 1957). In interpersonal relations, norms governing exchange and
reciprocity (Bkru, 1964; Gouldner, 1960; Homans,
1950) predict that imbalanced relationships of
liking or disliking evolve over time toward either mutual liking or mutual disliking. For
larger networks of social relations (triads and
beyond), general theories of balance (Heider,
1958) highlight the inherent instability of imbalance: it is hard to remain friendly with two people who hate each other (Wallace & Wolf, 1986).

<-----Page 5----->442

If one follows balance theories through to their
logical conclusions, social relationships simplify to a single point along a continuum ranging from reciprocated positive to reciprocated
negative sentiment.
Summary. Three interrelated assumptions
provide the foundation for much of the research
on trust relationships in organizations. Traditionally, scholars see trust and distrust as mutually exclusive and opposite conditions, they
see trust as "good" and distrust as "bad," and
they have given the social context of trust relationships limited attention. To the extent that we
can bring social context into the equation, we
note that the foundational assumptions concerning relationships emphasize relationship unidimensionality, balance, and consistency. We
now propose new relationship realities that
ground our more complex view of trust.
New Relationship Realities
We specify two core tenets to replace the central assumptions of the old view of relationships. First, relationships are multifaceted or
multiplex, therefore enabling parties to hold simultaneously different views of each otherviews that may be accurate but, nonetheless,
inconsistent among them. Second, balance and
consistency in one's cognitions and perceptions
are more likely to be temporary and transitional
states. Parties are more dominantly in states of
imbalance and inconsistency, and the tensions
created by these states do not necessarily promote quick and simple resolution. We elaborate
below.
Relationships are multifaceted and multiplex.
In all but the most primitive and simplistic relationships, we relate to each other in multiple
ways. Within the same relationship we have
different encounters in different contexts with
different intentions that lead to different outcomes. These encounters accumulate and interact to create a rich texture of experience. Parties
may have different experiences in working together on tasks and activities, may learn to function together in the same office environment,
and may share conversations about different
topics on which they agree and disagree. For
instance, I may get to know a professional colleague in my academic department fairly well.
Over time, I may learn that this colleague is
excellent as a theoretician, adequate but not

July

exceptional as a methodologist, highly limited
in skills as a classroom teacher, completely at
odds with me in his political beliefs, outstanding as a golfer, tediously boring in committee
meetings but periodically quite insightful, and
terrible at keeping appointments on time. My
disposition toward my colleague will be a function of all of these different encounters with him,
and I may have to learn to live with all of them
if he becomes my department chair. With an
appreciation of the richness of our relationship
and the varied facets of my colleague's "presentations of self," I can come to understand and
appreciate those domains where it is appropriate for me to trust him (and in what respects)
and those domains where trusting him is inappropriate (Baier, 1985; Govier, 1994).
The concept of link multiplexity within network relations provides an essential mechanism for depicting the richness of interpersonal
relationships (Katzenstein, 1996). Linkages connect actors within social networks and can represent any substantive connectivity or interaction. Multiplex relations exist where more than
one linkage is present (Farrace, Monger, & Russell, 1977; Monge & Eisenberg, 1987).1 In organizations scholars have examined multiplexity in
network relations, including exchanges of information, goods, and services; expressions of affection (liking or animosity); and attempts to influence and control (Monge & Eisenberg 1987;
Tichy, Tushman, & Fombrun, 1979).
There has been a tendency among social network scholars to assume that multiplex relations are simply (and unidimensionally) trusting
in nature (Husted, 1994; Ibarra, 1995). Given the
emerging and evolving nature of social relationships, we challenge this view and argue that
both trust and distrust can exist within multiplex relations. This view is grounded in our appreciation of the potential breadth of the bandwidth and richness of ongoing relationships. By
bandwidth, we mean the scope of the domains
of interpersonal relating and competency that
are relevant to a single interpersonal relationship. We see relationships as composed of facets: basic components of experience that an individual has with another. These facets

1 The dictionary defines multiplexity as more than one
channel. By abstraction, a uniplex relationship would entail
only a single form of linkage.

<-----Page 6----->1998

Lewicki, McAllister, and Hies

aggregate into bands, which are groupings of
facets across personal qualities that come to
define our experience with a single individual
in a single context. The broader the experience
across multiple contexts, the broader the bandwidth. In interpersonal relationships of trust and
distrust we see potential for enlargement in
relationship bandwidth as partners accumulate
knowledge of each other's strengths and/or
weaknesses in new interaction domains (Bkru,
1964).
In addition to breadth, we recognize the potential for richness in the texturing of relationships. That is, although some relationships may
be understood provisionally in general terms,
mature relationships tend to be characterized by
greater specification and detail across the
bandwidth (Gabarro, 1978; Holmes & RempeL
1989; Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996). Gabarro
(1978) observes that as trust relationships
evolve from orientation through exploration and
testing to stabilization, trust evolves from impressionistic and highly undifferentiated to
more finely grained and differentiated along
specific bases. He shows that as emphases shift
from "How much do I trust?" to "In what areas
and in what ways do I trust?" the limits of trust
and the domains where trust is inappropriate
become specified more clearly.
The effects of increased bandwidth and richness in texturing serve to create the conditions
for relationship multiplexity. Relationships mature with interaction frequency, duration, and
the diversity of challenges that relationship
partners encounter and face together. Each of
these components is essential. If the parties interact frequently and over a long period of time
but only superficially, or if they have an issuerich and frequent exchange but do so only
around a limited and bounded problem, or if
they interact around many issues but do so infrequently, these conditions limit the potential
for the relationship to mature. Alternatively, as
these components combine, the knowledge of
each relationship partner is enhanced.
Balance and consistency are temporary
states. The other traditional assumption we
challenge is that models of interpersonal behavior have been-and should continue to bestrongly grounded in notions of balance and
consistency. The tenet is that parties who experience any tension, inconsistency, and dissonance in relationships will find such a state

443

discomforting and will be motivated to resolve
the inconsistency. These assumptions are
grounded in the long-standing theories noted
earlier.
Although it is bold to deviate from an assumption that has dominated the physical and social
sciences for so long, we nevertheless need to
challenge that assumption when it comes to our
understanding of relationships. We believe that
the premise has been demonstrated and
"proved" over time because researchers have
tended to oversimplify the nature of relationships and to focus only on specific uniplex linkages. There is an overwhelming body of literature in which scholars have examined the
dynamics of dissonance reduction and tension
reduction, but resolution and tension reduction
are not the only mechanisms for dealing with
tension induced by inconsistent information and
coqnitions.f
Not all of one party's experiences with another
are consistent. Parties often have inadequate or
incomplete information to achieve balance or
resolve inconsistency; more commonly, parties
are interdependent (often not by choice) and
must effectively interact and coordinate action,
whether they like it or not. For example, let us
return to the relationship with the professional
colleague we described in the previous section.
How I relate to this colleague depends upon
whether we are going to write a theory paper
together, design a new course that we will teach
jointly, collaborate on a committee report or
take the afternoon off to play golf together. My
disposition toward my colleague is affected by
all of these different encounters that I may have
with him. I might combine all of these different
experiences and facets into one overall judgment of trust but to do so would be overly simplistic, moot and highly detrimental to my ability to work with him around specific and
compartmentalized interdependencies. So, I effectively function with this individual by "partitioning" my trust of my colleague as we talk

2 It is important to note that scholars may not always view
dissonance as aversive. Zajonc (1960) argues that people
work toward an optimum level of incongruity-psychological inconsistencies in beliefs, thoughts, perceptions, and
behaviors-that can be identified as a point between little
consistency and too much consistency. From this standpoint,
tension may be a condition that individuals choose to manage rather than eliminate (Pinder, 1984).

<-----Page 7----->444

research, work on the committee report, or discuss club choice on the third tee. This type of
compartmentalized, segmented relationship is
the rule, rather than the exception, in much of
our professional and personal lives.
Foundational support for this view of balance
and consistency follows from Lewinian field theory (Deutsch, 1968). From this perspective, consistent with basic principles from engineering
and physics, the current "status" of any dynamic
phenomenon is not a body at rest but, rather, a
body in "quasi-stationary equilibrium." Equilibrium, as distinct from rest, is the combined result of those forces pressuring to increase the
current level of the phenomenon and those
forces pressuring to decrease the current level of
the phenomenon. In relationships, links of interdependency serve as force elements; while each
force element may have a positive or negative
valence, contributing to pressures that can move
the equilibrium of the relationship in a positive
or negative direction, the coexistence of these
positive and negative links is completely acceptable in a complex view of the relationship.
Our argument, then, is that although parties
may pursue consistency and the resolution of inconsistent views, the more common state is not
one of balance but, rather, of imbalance, inconsistency, and "uncertainty" (Holmes & Levinger,
1994). Balance is a transitional state we pass
through as we process information; the continually arriving wealth of new information, the salience and prominence of that information, and
the multiple perspectives we have of this information continually push us toward inconsistency and
incongruer:ce. Balance and consistency depictions may be more accurately represented as single-frame snapshots of a dynamic time-series process, as relationships are transformed through
new information that becomes available and is
processed and interpreted.
In summary, a contemporary view of relationships and the dynamics within them suggests
that we need to stop viewing relationships as
unidimensional and uniplex and, instead, see
them as complex, multidimensional constructs.
The building blocks of these relationships are
facet elements in which we encounter the other
within a given context, at a given point in time,
and around a given interdependency. Within
each facet element, trust or distrust can develop,
and these facet elements aggregate into bands
of experience and across bands to produce rela-

July

tionships with differing degrees of bandwidth.
This aggregation process leads us to the second
critical element of this new view of relationships: it is possible (and likely) that as facets
aggregate, they are not necessarily consistent
with each other, and individuals can accommodate facets and hold views of the other that do
not need to achieve this consistency. Based on
these critical, revised assumptions, we now
elaborate on our new view of trust.

A NEW VIEW: TRUST AND DISTRUST ARE
SEPARATE DIMENSIONS
Having defined trust as confident positive expectations regarding another's conduct, and distrust as confident negative expectations regarding another's conduct, we now examine the
relationship between them and the possibilities
for their coexistence.
Although we define trust and distrust in reciprocal terms, we view them as separate and distinct constructs. Low distrust is not the same
thing as high trust, and high distrust is not the
same thing as low trust. We draw our intellectual foundations for this distinction from Luhmann's (1979) articulation of trust and distrust as
functional equivalents. Luhmann (1979) argues
that both trust and distrust function to allow
rational actors to contain and manage social
uncertainty and complexity, but they do so by
different means. From the scheme of possible
conduct, trust reduces social complexity and uncertainty by allowing specific undesirable conduct to be removed from consideration (simplification of the decision tree) and by allowing
desirable conduct to be viewed as certain. Similarly, distrust functions to reduce complexity by
allowing undesirable conduct to be seen as likely-even certain. Luhmann refers to this distrust
as the "positive expectation of injurious action"
(1979: 72). Distrust simplifies the social world,
allowing an individual to move rationally to
take protective action based on these expectations. Trust and distrust both entail certain expectations, but whereas trust expectations anticipate beneficial conduct from others, distrust
expectations anticipate injurious conductr'

decisions of an actor.

The distinctness of trust and distrust as separate constructs is made clearer when we contrast low trust and high distrust. On the one
hand, situations where certain expectations of
beneficial actions from others are absent (beneficial action is seen as u.ncertain or as certainly
not forthcoming) are best understood by the lack
of hope involved (e.g., hopeless). On the other
hand, situations where certain expectations of
harmful action are absent (harmful action is
seen as unlikely or as certainly not forthcoming)
are best understood by the absence of reasoned
fear (e.q., benign). Importantly, the conditions of
low trust and high distrust do not converge--they
are characterized as conceptually distinct conditions.
Our adaptation of Luhmann's formulation is
straightforward. Trust and distrust exist as two
separate dimensions, as we depict in Table 1.

For each dimension a quasi-stationary equilibrium of forces, composed of facets and bands
within the bandwidth, sustains trust or distrust
at a specific level. As specific facets in the relationship change (through dialogue, interaction,
joint decision making, common experience, and
so on), these changes will tend to move the operational level of trust or distrust upward or downward.
Within this framework, we present trust on the
vertical dimension and characterize it as either
high or 10w.4 Consistent with our definition and
understanding of trust, we see high-trust rela4 In this table we represent the trust and distrust dimensions as orthogonal to each other. Although we postulate
here that trust and distrust are separate dimensions, the
question of the relationship between the two dimensions
remains open, both theoretically and empirically.

tionships characterized by faith, confidence, assurance, initiative, and industry. Trust is the
mechanism by which the risks associated with
social complexity are transcended-risks that
might otherwise stifle initiative.
We present distrust on the horizontal dimension and similarly characterize it as either high
or low. Consistent with our definition and
understanding of distrust, we see distrust
expressed by wariness, skepticism, and such
behaviors as observed defensiveness, watchfulness, and vigilance. Finally, we see distrust-an
actor's assured expectation of intended harm
from the other-manifested in those social constraints (e.g., monitoring mechanisms or bureaucratic and regulatory controls) that represent
practical responses by wary and vigilant dependent parties to perceived threats. Although expressed distrust may become less visible with
controls in place, its manifest presence remains
(Ring & Van de Ven, 1994).
Within our two-dimensional framework, we
identify four prototypical relationship conditions: low trust/low distrust (cell I), high trust/
low distrust (cell 2), low trust/high distrust (cell
3), and high trust/high distrust (cell 4). Each condition is characterized by a distinct relationship
orientation and distinct relationship challenges.

Low Trust/Low Distrust (Celli)
Under conditions of low trust and low distrust,
an individual or actor has neither reason to be
confident nor reason to be wary and watchful.
The relationship likely is characterized by a limited number of facets, few bands, and low bandwidth. Over time and with increased interdependence, awareness of the other will develop
quickly, giving rise to the establishment of beliefs about the other's trustworthiness and untrustworthiness. Parties are not likely to engage
in any relationship dynamics requiring complex
interdependency or in complex assessments of
risk or vulnerability. Conversation most likely is
simple and casual, not violating the privacy of
either party or suggesting the existence of any
closeness or intimacy.

High Trust/Low Distrust (Cell 2)
Under conditions of high trust and low distrust, one actor has reason to be confident in
another and no reason to suspect the other. The

July

relationship likely is characterized by pooled
interdependence, where interested parties are
assured that partners are pussuinq common objectives. The facet elements, bands, and bandwidth of the relationship reflect a large number
of positive experiences, in which the aggregate
experience has been trust reinforcing. This experience creates social capital that enables the
trusting party to exercise initiative, assured of
the support of the trusted party. Parties are
likely to seek ways to continually develop and
enrich this relationship and to expand their mutually beneficial interdependencies. Conversation likely is complex and rich, reflecting each
party's awareness of the other.
In addition, the trusting party is likely to identify with the trusted's values, feel strong positive
affect toward the trusted, and express these feelings through various verbalizations of appreciation, support, and encouragement (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1995; McAllister, 1995). Parties will interact frequently, periodically invent new opportunities for interaction, and also monitor and "repair" the trust as tensions surface and are
resolved (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). These conditions reflect "promotive interdependence" and
cooperation (Deutsch, 1962). Evidence that contradicts trustworthiness beliefs likely is viewed
as suspect and is denied or considered unimportant by trusting parties. Further, we might expect contradictory evidence to invoke defense
mechanisms that serve to further consolidate
and strengthen trusting beliefs (Holmes &
Levinger, 1994; McAllister, 1997; Murray &
Holmes, 1994).

Low Trust/High Distrust (Cell 3)
Under conditions of high distrust and low
trust, one actor has no reason for confidence in
another and ample reason for wariness and
watchfulness. Conditions such as these make it
extremely difficult (if not impossible) to maintain effective interdependent relations over
time. The facet elements, bands, and bandwidth
of the relationship reflect a large number of negative experiences, in which the aggregate experience has been distrust reinforcing. If they must
interact, distrusting parties may devote significant resources to monitoring the other's behavior, preparing for the other's distrusting actions,
and attending to potential vulnerabilities that
might be exploited. For distrusting parties, con-

<-----Page 10----->1998

Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies

versation is likely to be cautious, guarded, and
often laced with sarcasm, cynicism, and sinister
attributions of the other's intentions and motives. In sustained relationships we expect attempts at preemption, as well as control mechanisms to be institutionalized in the form of
supervisory or monitoring roles, bureaucratic
checks and procedures, and the like (Luhmann,
1979; Shapiro, 1990; Zucker, 1986). In Deutsch's
terms the conditions exist for "contrient interdependence" (Deutsch, 1962) or suspicion (Deutsch,
1958, 1960).
Ultimately, we see cell 3 as an uncomfortable
condition for sustained working relationships.
When the parties have low trust and high distrust but are interdependent nevertheless, they
must find some way to manage their distrust.
One effective way is to compartmentalize dependence relationships, constraining the facets
and bands within which parties must be trusted
and separating them from "contamination" by
distrusting facets and bands. A practical example of the transformation of a distrust relationship into a trust relationship is Leon Panetta's
change in his relationship with Dick Morris
(Ogden, 1997). At the outset of their working relationship at the White House, Panetta (White
House Chief of Staff) distrusted Morris (political
adviser to President Clinton). Panetta's method
of handling this relationship was to approach
the President and request that Morris be commanded to work within the rules set out by
Panetta. Within clearly specified parameters
outlined by Panetta, Morris was trusted and
could be drawn upon as an invaluable resource.
Ultimately, we argue that distrust relations are
most effectively managed when they allow for
the emergence of constrained trust relations
that permit functional interaction within the
constraints.

High Trust/High Distrust (Cell 4)
Under conditions of high trust and high distrust, one party has reason to be highly confident in another in certain respects, but also has
reason to be strongly wary and suspicious in
other respects. The relationship likely is characterized by multifaceted reciprocal interdependence, where relationship partners have separate as well as shared objectives. The facet
elements, bands, and bandwidth of the relationship reflect many positive experiences, in which

447

the aggregate experience has been trust reinforcing, and many negative experiences, in
which the aggregate experience has been distrust reinforcing. In order to sustain and benefit
from this form of relationship, parties can take
steps to limit their interdependence to those
facet linkages that reinforce the trust and
strongly bound those facet linkages engendering the distrust.
An example of this bounded trust is the joint
venture between Boeing and the Japanese in
building the Boeing 777. In this joint venture
engineers worked together by sharing significant amounts of technical and proprietary information. However, Boeing consciously protected
itself from vulnerability against Japanese spying by limiting the access of Japanese engineers
to "secure" areas within Boeing (Sabbagh, 1996).
Of the four conditions, we believe this condition of sustained trust and distrust is the most
prevalent for multiplex working relationships in
modern organizations. At their inception, interpersonal relationships may be characterized in
terms of anyone of these four prototypical relationship condi tions (represented in cells 1
through 4). The factors that might influence the
initial relationship configurations can include
trust or distrust accumulated in prior relationships (Larson, 1992), reputation information
(Stinchcombe & Heimer, 1985), personality factors (Rotter, 1971; Stack, 1988), social similarities
and differences (Zucker, 1986), and contextual
factors (Shapiro, 1990; Zucker, 1986). The realities
of organizing in the twenty-first century lead us
to recognize that distrust is much more prevalent than students of trust in organizations have
been willing to admit and, consequently, that
the percentage of high-trust/low-distrust relationships (cell 2) has been overstated. Our expectation is that practical trust and distrust (cell
4) emerges and is the most prevalent form as
business relationships mature and interdependencies are expanded and elaborated between
executives in teams, partnerships, and alliances.

NEW RELATIONSHIP FOUNDATIONSSUPPORT FOR THE NEW VIEW
We believe that our approach to the study of
trust and distrust represents a bold break with
traditional scholarly approaches. Nevertheless,
empirical foundations for the tenets of our re-

<-----Page 11----->448

search are already in place. In this section we
present evidence that positive and negative attitudes frequently do not exist along a single
continuum; that ambivalent attitudes, characterized by simultaneous positive and negative
sentiments, are commonplace; and that the empirical study of trust and distrust shows the separability of these constructs and the possibility
of their coexistence.

The Opposite of Trust Is Not Distrust

Our thesis rests on the contention that trust
and distrust are not opposite ends of a single
trust-distrust continuum-the opposite of trust is
not distrust. More broadly, psychologists are increasingly calling for re-examination of the assumption that positive-valent and negativevalent attitudes are opposite ends of a single
continuum (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Petty,
Wegener, & Fabrigar, 1997). Research findings
regarding positive and negative affectivity suggest that these are not opposite ends of the same
continuum but exist, rather, as distinct bipolar
constructs (Burke, Brief, George, Robertson, &
Webster, 1989; Watson & Tellegen, 1985).
Watson and Tellegen (1985) found that high
positive affectivity (e.g., active, strong, excited,
enthusiastic, peppy, and elated) was not synonymous with low negative affectivity (e.g., calm,
relaxed, at rest, and placid). Similarly, low positive affectivity (e.g., sleepy, dull, drowsy, and
sluggish) was not synonymous with high negative affectivity (e.g., distressed, scornful, hostile,
fearful, nervous, and jittery). Others have similar findings demonstrating the separability of
positive-valent and negative-valent constructs
for optimism/pessimism (Stallings, Dunham,
Gatz, & Bengtson, 1997), interracial attitudes
(Katz & Hass, 1988; Katz, Wackenhut, & Hass,
1986; Patchen, Hofman, & Davidson, 1976), and
attitudes toward blood and organ donation
(Cacioppo & Gardner, 1993).
The consequences of separate positive-valent
and negative-valent constructs are far reaching.
Whereas positive-valent and negative-valent
constructs may be systematically negatively
correlated, their antecedents and consequences
usually are separate and distinct (Cacioppo &
Gardner, 1993). The factors related to positive
affect are distinct from those surrounding negative affect (Watson & Tellegen, 1985).

July

To the extent that trust and distrust are separable and distinct constructs, it is imperative
that we systematically explore and understand
the nature, antecedents, and consequences of
each. For instance, it would be extremely misleading to assume either that the positive predictors of trust would necessarily be negative
predictors of distrust or that the positive consequences of trust would necessarily be influenced negatively by increased distrust. Moreover, our assertion is that there is no unitary
midpoint between the "positive" condition of
trust and the "aversive" condition of distrust. As
positive expectations of another's conduct become less certain (i.e., the accumulation of "negative" facet elements and bands increases),
feelings of uncertainty and unpredictability increase. As negative expectations of another's
conduct become less certain, an individual may
sense that this portion of the social world is
more benign. Importantly, although benign and
uncertain conditions can occur simultaneously,
they do not represent overlapping or intersecting conditions on the singular trust-distrust continuum.
Ambivalence Is Commonplace

Our thesis rests on the possibility of ambivalence with respect to trust and distrust: the possibility of coexistent trust and distrust. Our contention is that it would be misleading to reduce
expressed trust and distrust to some intermediary or average sentiment.
Individuals experience ambivalence when
positive and negative attitudes toward a single
target coexist (Otnes, Lowrey, & Shrum, 1997;
Priester & Petty, 1996; Thompson, Zanna, & Griffin, 1995). The existence of separate and distinct
antecedents of positive-valent and negativevalent attitudes provides for the possibility that
both attitude forms will be primed. Possibly the
earliest recognition of ambivalence can be
found in Freud's systematic reflections on the
coexistence of apparently opposing intimate
sentiments, such as love and hate and affection
and hostility (Freud, 1918). Freud's contention is
consistent with research findings showing that
individuals in abusive relationships may simultaneously harbor strong feelings of love, as well
as hate, for each other (Petty & Cacioppo, 1996).
The evidence of ambivalence as a psychological condition of consequence is considerable.

<-----Page 12----->1998

Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies

For instance, researchers studying racial attitudes among White Americans have shown that
it is possible for individuals to simultaneously
maintain pro-Black and anti-Black sentiments
(Katz & Hass, 1988; Katz et al., 1986). Researchers
studying interpersonal attachments have found
that ambivalence (characterized by simultaneous desires for closeness and distance) is a
distinguishing feature of the attachment orientations for approximately 10 percent of the U.S.
adult population (Mickelson, Kessler, & Shaver,
1997). Also, researchers studying characteristic
attitudes of individuals attempting to quit smoking have discovered frequent evidence of strong
positive and strong negative beliefs and feelings about smoking (Petty & Cacioppo, 1996). Yet
another example of ambivalence is provided by
researchers examining individual expectations
of benefit and harm from confederates in experimental game situations, who have shown these
expectations to be independent and that subjects can expect both benefit and harm from
others (Nacci et al., 1973). Finally, we have noted
that the classical "two-factor" theory of worker
motivation argues that individuals can be both
satisfied and dissatisfied with aspects of a job
(Herzberg et al., 1967; King, 1970).
Just as it is possible to experience attraction
and disattraction, to like and dislike, and to love
and hate, it may be possible to both trust and
distrust others. Importantly, researchers have
shown that as interpersonal relationships become closer (Coser, 1956; Simmel, 1955), and as
the social context of relationships becomes
more complex and characterized by information
overload, role conflicts, and change (Mancini,
1993; Otnes et al., 1997), the likelihood of ambivalence in beliefs, attitudes, and expectations
increases. Of course, in organizational settings
where complexity, uncertainty, and role conflict
are commonplace, and where ongoing interpersonal relationships mature over time and are
multiplex in nature, the potential for simultaneous trust and distrust to emerge is considerable.
Trust and Distrust Are Separable

Above and beyond the potential for trust and
distrust to exist as separate and distinct constructs, and the potential for positive-valent and
negative-valent attitudes such as trust and distrust to coexist, research evidence clearly indi-

449

cates that trust and distrust can be operationalized as separate and distinct constructs.
First, empirical evidence supports the assertion that assessments of the trustworthiness of
others cannot be accounted for on a single continuum. Using the Philosophies of Human Nature (PHN) scale (a survey instrument addressing the beliefs of individuals about the ways in
which other people generally behave), Robinson, Shaver, and Wrightsman (1991) show that
trust beliefs are separate and distinct from distrust beliefs (cynicism) and that the trust and
distrust beliefs cannot be reduced to opposite
ends of a single continuum. Constantinople
(1969), measuring basic trust and basic distrust
among college students, demonstrates that it is
possible to measure trust and distrust as separate constructs and that these constructs have
separate and distinct patterns of variation
across gender, year of college, and time span.
More recent empirical support comes from a
study of coal mineworkers' trust in their managers. Clark and Payne (1997) show that workers'
characteristically certain negative assertions
about the behavior of managers and about how
they, as workers, intend to behave in their
interactions with management (trust-relevant
statements) are clearly separable from characteristically certain positive assertions about
management's behavior and about workers' behavioral intentions (distrust-relevant statements).
Second, evidence supports the assertion that
trust and distrust can coexist. In ethnographic
fieldwork Mancini (1993) explores the practical
challenges of managing ambivalence within
relationships involving confidences and privacy. Mancini's exploration of the relationship
between politicians and journalists in modern
Italy demonstrates the practical importance of
building and maintaining trust relationships
with sources of information, while treating
with suspicion much of the information received from those sources. Ambivalence (of
journalists toward politicians, and vice versa)
that encompasses both trust and distrust is
reality for politicians and journalists alike.
Besides findings from field research, findings
from quasi-experimental research on ambivalence show that trust and distrust attitudes may
coexist. Priester and Petty's (1996) operationalization of ambivalence in their research has
particular relevance for our arguments. These

<-----Page 13----->450

Academy of Management Review

researchers provided subjects with a set of
words that might describe traits of a person,
asking the subjects to form an impression of the
person described. Subjects received combinations of both positive-trait descriptors (dependable, honest, kind, loyal, reliable, trustworthy,
trusting, and understanding) and negative-trait
descriptors (untrustworthy, dishonest, lying, malicious, mean, and untrusting). Importantly, the
terms included "trust" and "distrust," as well as
other words typically associated with them. The
researchers found that subjects had little difficulty
forming impressions of people possessing both
positive and negative traits, signifying the existence of ambivalence with respect to trust and
distrust as a natural condition that people intuitively understand and are comfortable with.

Summary
Our review of available research points to the
possibilities of separating trust from distrust
and for trust and distrust's coexistence. Findings
from the broader scope of social science research show that positive-valent and negativevalent attitudes frequently are separable and
distinct, and they can coexist. Impressively, recent evidence indicates that this might be the
case of interpersonal trust sentiments in particular. This research is still in its infancy, but we
can outline critical implications of what we already know for our understanding of interpersonal relationships in organizations.

IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW VIEW: CORE
ISSUES AND A RESEARCH AGENDA
Our analysis of social relationships within organizations proceeds from the assumption that
trust and distrust sentiments vary independently and can coexist. Within multiplex social
relationships, selected facets of a relationship
can be characterized by varying degrees of trust,
whereas others can be characterized by varying
degrees of distrust. This perspective fits well
with the understanding that networks of social
relations are penetrated by elements of trust
and distrust (Granovetter, 1985: 491). In this section we address the substantive and farreaching implications of this view of trust and
distrust for our understanding of individual relationships as well as broader social and organizational relationships.

Precarious Confidences: Trust and Distrust
Decoupled and Reconnected
Distrust and trust are elements of social relationships present within all social systems.
Scholars generally understand trust and distrust as functional equivalents (Luhmann, 1979),
but social structures appear most stable where
there is a healthy dose of both trust and distrust-a productive tension of confidences exists. As Luhmann argues, "For contemporary circumstances, trust cannot exist apart from
distrust, and trust cannot increase apart from
increases in distrust. Increases in trust or distrust-apart from increases in the other-may
do more harm than good!" (1979: 89). We contend
that the potential for dysfunction in confidence
relationships increases when either trust beliefs
are maintained to the exclusion of distrust or
distrust beliefs are maintained to the exclusion
of trust. We view this dynamic tension of trust
and distrust beliefs as productive, in the best
interests of confiding parties, and as a source of
stability for relationships.
To an extent, we find it surprising that simultaneous trust and distrust have not been explored in some detail. It is rarely the case that a
single summary motive or interest can be identified that accounts for the variety of behaviors
of a given relationship partner. Rather, the motives of relationship partners usually can be
characterized as partially convergent, partially
divergent, and partially unrelated (Sheppard,
1995). Although convergent interests provide
reasonable foundations for trust in the form of
confident positive expectations for desired behavior, divergent interests provide foundations
for distrust, characterized by confident expectations of undesired behavior. Furthermore,
relationships are frequently multifaceted
(Sheppard, 1995) and, in some cases, compartmentalized (Sabbagh, 1995), yielding the possibility that relationship partners might trust each
other in certain respects, not trust each other in
other respects, and even distrust each other at
times. Accordingly, foundations for both trust
and distrust abound, and the manner in which
social relations are managed represents a
chosen strategy for both containing expected
undesired conduct and capitalizing on the
opportunities made possible because of
expected desired conduct.

<-----Page 14----->1998

Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies

A deeper understanding of the importance of
simultaneous trust and distrust emerges when
we consider the dynamics of (1) trust relationships where distrust is consciously suppressed
and (2) distrust relationships where evidence of
possible trustworthiness is summarily dismissed.
In the first case, although trust expressed by
individuals in relationship partners typically is
rational and grounded in experience, it can be
misattributed at times, and existing foundations
for distrust can be discounted or ignored. The
rich sociological tradition of research on whitecollar crime points to the role of "overgeneralized" trust as a necessary precondition for the
undermonitoring of trusted employees that
leads to possible deception, fraud, and embezzlement (Cressy, 1953; Granovetter, 1985; Shapiro, 1987, 1990). As Shakespeare observed,
And oftentimes to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence (Macbeth, Act I, Scene III,
line 123).

While would-be betrayers can strategically
build trust relationships that create the blindness needed for subsequent exploitation,
individuals who are the anticipated targets of
deception can unwittingly participate as coconspirators, invoking justification processes and
sense-making tactics to deny, discount, and reinterpret evidence of untrustworthiness that
would otherwise provide foundations for distrust (McAllister, 1997). For instance, Holmes and
Rempel (1989) found that highly trusting individuals within close relationships evaluated partner behavior and motives more positively after
being asked to recall negative information
about the partner than when asked to recall
positive information. Murray and Holmes (1994)
postulate that positive representations (beliefs
and illusions, rather than true perceptions) of
the other arise because of perceived faults in the
partner-not in spite of them. To the extent that
the other's suspicious conduct is denied or reinterpreted in a positive light, or serves to invoke
justifications for investments in trust relationships, the potential for systematic abuses of
trust relationships will be greatly enhanced.
Apart from a genuine openness to the possible
necessity of distrust, benign and unconditional
trust appears to be an extremely dangerous
strategy for managing social relations.

451

In the second case, although distrust expressed by individuals in relationship partners
usually has some empirical foundation and usually is justifiable, it can give rise to paranoid
cognitions (Bies & Tripp, 1996; Bies, Tripp, &
Kramer, 1997) and to the summary dismissal or
reinterpretation of evidence of actual trustworthiness. Perceptions of hurt and betrayal are not
uncommon in organizations (Hansson, Jones, &
Fletcher, 1990; Harris, 1994) and can be associated with instances where true harm, injury, or
hardship has taken place (Bies & Tripp, 1996).
Perceptions of betrayal provide foundations for
distrust and for subsequent negative framing of
social information concerning the perpetrator
(Bies et al., 1997). Paranoid cognitions can emerge,
centered on the strategic matters of revenge (Bies
et al., 1997), as well as on continual monitoring of
the distrusted perpetrator. From this vantage
point, benevolent or altruistic conduct by the target of distrust may be viewed as further evidence
of manipulativeness, an attempt to "rub it in," an
attempt at impression management, and so forth.
Importantly, objective evidence of trustworthiness
along facets of the relationship can be misattributed and summarily dismissed, and, ultimately,
the potential efficiencies and savings associated
with trust relations can be lost.
Our analysis points to difficulties encountered where broad trust or distrust emerges and
where countervailing facets that support the
contrary view are suppressed. In a more positive
light, Luhmann argues that increases in distrust
can serve the purposes of enabling the emergence of greater trust in social systems. "Trust
depends on the inclination towards risk being
kept under control and on the quota of disappointments not becoming too large. If this is
correct, then ... a system of higher complexity,
which needs more trust, also needs at the same
time more distrust" (1979: 89). Given the inherent
limitations of exclusive trust or distrust (cells 2
and 3) and the practical possibilities for simultaneous trust and distrust, we propose that future research systematically address simultaneous trust/distrust conditions.
Distrust Redeemed: New Theoretical
Foundations
Understanding that distrust and trust relations are embedded and entrenched within systems of social relations, we argue that future

<-----Page 15----->452

Academy of Management Review

research must systematically address the functionality of distrust beliefs and sentiments. Although the espoused view has been that more
trust is better, and that distrust is an unfortunate
reality when trust fails (Arrow, 1974), we believe
that the potential for productive distrust to contribute to, rather than detract from, economic
order and efficiency merits consideration. Given
the reality of distrust within social systems, and
adopting the mindset of the economist who argues that "what is efficient, persists," we feel
the emergent research question must be one
that addresses the efficiencies, functionality,
and utilities of distrust. Here, we explore the
implications of distrust for management theory.
We contend that the theoretical significance
of distrust in our understanding of organizational behavior and organization theory is profound.
Indeed, dynamics of distrust may be fundamental to our understanding of the theory of the firm
and the fundamental principles underlying the
emergence of complex organizations (Simon,
1957; Thompson, 1967; Williamson, 1974). More
specifically, distrust emerges as a central component in the promotion of rationality within
organizations. Simon (1957) argues that organizations are able to achieve a level of rationality
that transcends the rationality of their members
by instituting structures and systems that leverage distrust to constrain and bind individual
rationality. He identifies human limitations that
impede organizational rationality of three
sorts-(l) limitations in skills, (2) limitations in
knowledge and information, and (3) limitations
in values and purposes that diverge from organizational goals-and argues that organizations
enable individuals to behave rationally (from
the perspective of the organization) by creating
work environments where
1. there is a match between individual skills
and job requirements,
2. information provided to individuals corresponds to job requirements,
3. jobs are designed keeping in mind human
limitations in information-processing capabilities, and
4. steps are taken to bring individual values
into conformity with organizationally espoused values.

Ultimately, Simon argues that "rationality
does not determine behavior. Within the area of
rationality behavior is perfectly flexible and
adaptable to abilities, goals, and knowledge.

July

Instead, behavior is determined by the irrational
and nonrational elements that bound the area of
rationality" (1957: 241). Organizational rationality is achieved by restricting those domains of
conduct within which individuals' abilities,
knowledge, and goals do not conform with those
of the organization: domains within which individuals are, a priori, distrusted. Organizational
practices that bound rationality (eliminate nonrational components) serve to manage the dynamics of distrust, creating domains of actionzones of acceptance-within which employees
can be expected to cooperate with authorities.
Interestingly enough, the notion of bounded
rationality effectively serves the purpose of containing elements of distrust, and it does little to
promote trust. We can sharply separate employee acceptance of and/or indifference to authority from wholesale endorsement of the goals
and values of those in authority. Correspondingly, from the perspective of our framework
(Table I), removal of foundations of distrust
(characterized by fear, skepticism, and vigilance) through acceptance of authority does not
necessarily facilitate the emergence of trust
(characterized by faith, hope, and initiative),
which might follow from positive identification
with and endorsement of the values of those in
authority.
Our analysis points to the centrality of distrust as a foundational requirement for effective
organization. Although by no means denying
the importance of trust and the efficiencies attributed thereto, we suspect that the dynamics of
distrust may be even more pivotal as we attempt
to improve our understanding of organizations
and the behavior of the people in them.
Managing Trust and Distrust: New Directions
for Practice and Research

Despite the critical importance of distrust as
well as trust, and the prevalence of conditions
promoting ambivalence, we know very little
about how ambivalence is managed. At the individual level, we note that research by Schulz
(1984) shows that the inability to handle ambivalent conditions and the consistent adoption of
"cll-or-nothinq" positions may indicate abnormal psychological development. Within organizational settings, we contend that the capacity
to cope with ambivalence-promoting conditions
is a critical competence that some may possess

<-----Page 16----->1998

Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies

to a greater degree than others. The capacity for
coping with ambivalence may have foundations
that are both dispositional-associated with an
individual's capacity to handle incongruity
(Zajonc, 1960), risk preferences (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1984), and propensity to differentiate
(Morse & Gordon, 1974; Wilson & Malik, 1995)and developmental (associated with an individual's prior experience with ambivalence and
training).
At the interpersonal level, we see critical opportunities for managing ambivalence in peer
relations and leader-member interaction. Organization members must know not only when
to trust others, and in what respects, but also
when to monitor others closely. Furthermore, organization members must develop the capacity
to manage the ways in which they are trusted
and distrusted by others. For instance, much of
the current research on managerial effectiveness follows Thompson (1967), emphasizing the
role of the "confidence of coordinate others" or
reputation and trustworthiness (Tsui. 1994) as
the foundation for effectiveness assessments.
Interestingly enough, research findings indicate
that the individuals most successful at managing their reputations for effectiveness are distinguished by their efforts to seek negative as well
as positive feedback on their performance, suggesting that effective self-regulation is the product of efforts to manage distrust as well as trust
relations simultaneously (Ashford & Tsui, 1991).
Organization members can direct efforts at minimizing distrust in some relationships and enhancing trust within other relationships.
Also, at the interpersonal level, we believe the
dynamics of ambivalence within collaborative
relations and teamwork merit systematic consideration. We contend that functional coexistence of trust and distrust may be a central component in high-performance teams. Janis's
(1972) foundational work on the dynamics of
groupthink demonstrates the impact of excessive solidarity and cohesiveness within groups
on team performance. Insofar as trust is a necessary precondition for team cohesion, excessive trust and active suppression of distrust
(rather than excessive cohesiveness) may be at
the root of groupthink dynamics. Understandably, distrust that gives rise to questioning and
differences in perspective may be essential for
effective group functioning. By the same token,
distrust that gives rise to questioning is of little

453

value if team participants have insufficient trust
in their peers to voice reservations and alternative perspectives. Ultimately, the functional coexistence of trust and distrust may be a necessary precondition for the emergence of "hot
groups" (Leavitt & Lipman-Blumen, 1995) and
"good fights" (Eisenhardt, Kahwajy, & Bourgeous, 1997).
In the broader scope of interpersonal relating,
we see a dynamic tension between trust and
distrust, reflected in the pressures toward heterogeneity that enhance the foundations for effective decision making and problem solving, as
well as the pressures toward homogeneity that
facilitate harmonious interaction and coordinated implementation. For instance, in
Granovetter's influential argument concerning
the "strength of weak ties," we see the benefits
of distant acquaintances rather than close associates for managing crises (getting a job, thwarting opposition, and the like). Granovetter's argument centers on the fact that "those to whom
we are weakly tied are more likely to move in
circles different from us and will thus have access to information different from that which we
receive" (1973: 1371). By the same token, those to
whom we are weakly tied are more inclined to
have values and preferences different from our
own, providing a partial foundation for distrust
within the relationship. Indeed, Granovetter
notes that as the strength of the ties between
individuals weakens, so does the potential for
trust development. Ultimately, a party's effectiveness in organizing for concerted action depends on his or her ability to leverage the benefits of diversity while managing the inherent
dynamics of trust and distrust within the relationship.
Trust and distrust have been central themes
in negotiation and conflict management research (Deutsch, 1973; Lewicki & Stevenson, in
press). Although in his early formulation
Deutsch (1958) explicitly discussed trust and
suspicion, contemporary authors have tended to
emphasize the former and neglect the latter, not
to mention the coexistence dynamics of the two.
Sheppard (1995) has challenged us to rethink
negotiation theory and principles within and
across organizational relationships. For example, one domain rich for future study is the negotiation of partnerships and alliances. Yoshino
and Rangan address trust as central to the cre-

<-----Page 17----->454

ation and management of alliances. They quote
one alliance manager:
Let's face it, every alliance is plagued by strong
suspicions right from the start. Senior managers
in both firms wonder what the true motives of the
other firm are.... It is our job to make sure that
suspicions do not get so out of hand as to impede
the alliance and to develop working relationships to ensure to the extent possible that the
people in each firm trust those in the other. Believe me, it's not easy" (1995: 124).

The explicit manner in which this manager talks
about both managing suspicions and developing relationships to assure that people trust
each other affirms our arguments.
At more macro levels of analysis, we see
considerable potential for concerted attention
on the institutional dynamics of distrust. Luhmann (1979), who argues that if we hope to
increase levels of trust in society, we must be
prepared to increase aggregate levels of distrust as well, suggests that distrust can be
institutionalized in formal organizational
roles and that this process may be essential
for the expansion of trust. Distrust may be
institutionalized in specialized roles (e.g.,
quality control inspectors or auditors), positions (e.g., first-line supervisors), and sanctions (applicable punishments for specific infractions). Zucker (1986) argues that the drastic
increase in the size of the managerial workforce between 1870 and 1930 signified the
emergence of a new institutionalized mode of
trust production. Interestingly enough, Zucker's argument for the role of managers in the
production of trust hinges on the fact that distrust was institutionalized in specific roles;
ultimately, increases in trust were made possible by increases in institutionalized distrust.
At present, we know little about the mechanisms by which the institutional arrangement of
distrust serves the purpose of promoting trust.
Luhmann (1979) argues that institutionalized
distrust allows for the depersonalization of distrust activities: quality control people do their
work because it's their job-not necessarily because they personally distrust others. Furthermore, formalized procedures for sanctioning infractions may be useful because they specify
limits on the extent of retribution possible and
specifically provide for restitution.

CONCLUSION
In the rural areas around Ithaca it is common for
farmers to put some fresh produce on a table by
the road. There is a cash box on the table, and
customers are expected to put money in the box
in return for the vegetables they take. The box
has just a small slit, so money can only be put in,
not taken out. Also, the box is attached to the
table, so no one can (easily) make off with the
money (Dawes & Thaler, 1988: 195).

Dawes and Thaler's depiction of simultaneous
trust and distrust in operation is revealing.
Rather than representing some average expectation or understanding of human nature, the
example suggests a rich understanding of human nature that gives rise to both distrust (acted
on by making the slit in the cash box small and
affixing the box to the table) and trust (acted on
by leaving the vegetables and the table unmanned). We contend that organizations are rife
with mixed- and multiple-motive conditions that
challenge people's ability to manage the complexities of simultaneous trust and distrust. We
call for a richer understanding of the dynamics
of trust and distrust relations-one which
makes specific provision for conditions of ambivalence. This article represents an initial step
in that direction.
