Abstract
Large, successful firms, even with a history of innovation, may create organizational mechanisms
that hamper innovation and customer response. This paper will describe how 3M purposefully fights
this tendency by attempting to foster innovation within the company through the development of
efficient strategies to commercialize technology in rapidly changing environments. The paper will
describe 3M’s general policies and its entrepreneurial culture, which are largely well publicized in
the popular literature. But the focus will be on on-going strategies to accelerate the commercialization of technology in its electronic business. Specifically, the case of the Electronic Markets Center
(EMC), a 3M Electronic and Communications Group unit created in 1997 to leverage the broad
range of 3M’s electronic products and technologies will be described and analyzed. Fifteen business units were organized around one single entity to more effectively ensure an overall coordinated
strategy for 3M in the electronics market that could change the growth rate of 3M’s sales to the electronic industry from 9% per year to 24% per year. The paper will focus on two critical components
of the EMC: (1) what were the strategies behind the design of EMC; (2) how did EMC developed
processes to manage the interdependence of the technical and business understanding of industry
segments and the relations with key accounts. The paper concludes with lessons learned from the 3M
experience thus far, and with recommendations on how to fight some of the barriers to innovation
and technology commercialization in large firms. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
While the nature of competition among firms is highly dependent on industry structure,
at a high level of abstraction we can contrast two ways of competing. One is through the
optimization of productive resources in order to gain the market-allowed margins of profit. In
a way, this “competition through efficiency” corresponds to the perspective of firm behavior
of neoclassical economics. 1 A second way is to disrupt the market through the introduction
of innovations, which give to the innovative firm a temporary absolute advantage (granted
by a formal patent or secured by secret) over every other firms. Again, these forms of
competition co-exist in all industries, and are a concern of most firms, but Schumpeter
(1950), comparing one with the other, described the “competition through innovation” as
a bomb that destroys the building, while “competing through efficiency” is not much more
than hitting the front door.
Thus, the concern with being innovative as been a major feature of most firms’ behavior. But to be innovative, it is important to know how the innovation process works. Early
conceptualizations of the innovation process stressed the need to undergo research activities to generate new ideas. Through R&D, firms could institutionalize efforts to search the
frontiers of knowledge for inventions that could translate into new products and processes.
The commercialization of these products would ensue. Many studies confirm the linkage
between R&D efforts at the firm level, and increased performance and competitive stance.
Griliches (1998) provides an overview of a vast body of work produced by him largely dedicated to the study of this problem. Mansfield (1984) is another major reference. At the other
extreme, some suggested that innovation should merely be the result of perceived market
needs by firms. The so-called market-pull view of innovation, pioneered by Schmookler, and
critically analyzed by Rosenberg (1972), started as an empirical observation, but quickly
moved into the normative world of management and policy.
Still, despite the existence of a correlation between R&D expenditure in firms and
innovation, this relation was far from being direct, linear and predictable. In the simplest
terms, an increase by a firm of its R&D budget would not certainly assure a proportional
(or even with decreasing returns) growth in innovative output. On the other hand, merely
responding to market needs may not provide the leading-edge technological superiority
needed to introduce really path-breaking innovations. Tidd et al. (1997) review the deficiencies of both of these linear perspectives. The work of Rosenberg (1982, 1994) and
others showed the complexity of the process through which new technologies are created
and commercialized. Much has to do, more than with the resources committed to R&D,
with what Teece (1986) called the firms complementary assets: the way in which in firm
is organized, and interacts with customers, suppliers, and competitors. This view requires
a more casuistic analysis of successful innovation by firms. Instead of general recipes of
“what makes a firm innovative”, research on how successful innovation occurs needs to
be complemented with case analysis of firms with a track record in terms of technology
commercialization.
This paper is a contribution to this literature. We will describe initiatives within a large,
innovative firm, 3M, aimed at improving the performance of technology commercializa1

tion. Why does a large and innovative firm such as 3M need to do something about its
technology commercialization capability? Very successful companies are often the victims
of their own success. Success brings growth, larger size and increasing economies of scale
(Chandler, 1990), more resources to invest in business and technology opportunities (Schumpeter, 1950), higher leverage in the marketplace and in the bargaining relationships with
customers and suppliers (Porter, 1988), to name a few advantages. These benefits translate
into better conditions for further success and growth. Still, success brings with it the curse
of complacency and conservatism. These adjectives should not be understood as making
an universal “moral” judgement on the path followed by successful companies, but are
rather associated with the consequences of the organizational requirements of large enterprises: more codified and rigid procedures (as people cease to know each other personally).
Weber (1997) was the first to conceptualize this need of large organizations, with his theory
of bureaucracies. Chandler (1962, 1980) showed how the creation of bureaucracies based
on organizational innovations such as the multi-division company (pioneered by Alfred
Sloan at General Motors) was critical to the business development of the large American
corporations of the second half of the 20th century.
But, again, bureaucracies tend to be complacent and conservative. Technological change,
innovation, and changing consumer preferences risk being overlooked. While being large
brings advantages in terms of resources available to invest in R&D and other innovative
activities, as Schumpeter (1950) argued, it is also true that size brings with it organizational
features that can hamper innovation (Teece, 1986). Anecdotes on large firms, even with
a history of innovation, becoming complacent and failing to see the technological and
consumer preferences changes abound. The example of IBM in the early 1990s comes
prominently to mind (Hannah, 1998).
The argument outlined in the previous paragraphs seems inconsistent with Chandler’s
(1990) theory of firm development. In this well known work, Chandler (1990) argued
that large corporations, many created by the beginning of the 20th century, were able to
accumulate technical, organizational, and marketing capabilities that translated into virtually
unassailable first-mover advantages that led them to dominate over time the oligopolies
they generated. Based on this argument, Chandler (1990) went as far as suggesting that
the decline of UK’s economic dominance was associated with its inability to create the
conditions for the emergence of these large global giants, while Germany and the US were
able to do just that. However, Hannah (1999) shows that Chandler’s (1990) argument,
which is largely in synch with common sense perception, is clouded by selection bias:
by looking only at successful firms, one looses track of the many failures that occurred
over time.
Table 1 summarizes what has happened in 1995 to the global top 100 industrial of 1912.
It shows that almost half of the giants of 1912 disappeared by 1995, and that almost a third
experienced bankruptcy. Thus, despite our common perception that giant firms created at
the start of the century are still successful today (we may think of Du Pont, Shell, Procter &
Gamble, Siemens, among others), the more common outcome for a large firm, with giant
managerial hierarchies and large market and first-mover advantages, is failure.
By the same token, Chandler’s (1990) hypothesis on the superior performance of large
firms in the US and Germany versus UK fails the scrutiny of careful empirical analysis.
In fact, Hannah (1998) shows that only 23% of the 1912 US giants still existed among

the top 100 in 1995, while 75% of the large UK firms persisted from 1912 to 1995. Thus,
Hannah (1998, p. 64) concludes that “Europe has been the home of the Chandlerian stable
oligopolies; America has more obviously been the creative (and destructive) dynamo of the
Schumpeterian paradigm”.
Therefore, we can now be more secure of Schumpeter’s (1950) assertion mentioned in
the first paragraph, that Schumpeterian competition is a much more powerful force than
“efficiency” competition. But we also see that creative destruction has been a major feature
of the economic history of large firms in the US, probably more intensely than anywhere in
the world. These arguments combine to reinforce the idea that the ability of firms to innovate
is crucial. And even large firms, which have in principle great advantages as compared with
small ones, are not immune to the destructive power of innovation by other firms. We have
also seen that the innovation process is not linear, nor a direct result of R&D, neither a
consequence of predicting market needs with perfect foresight.
So what do successfully innovative firms do right? This answer, obviously, has many
responses, and we again insist that efforts to look for recipes are doomed to fail. But we
can exclude apparently simple, and seemingly reasonable, answers. For example, we saw
that just doing R&D is not enough. And that anticipating market needs is not enough either.
It is also not sufficient to try to create monopolistic positions by relying extensively on
patenting is not likely to work, especially in highly volatile and vibrant high technology
areas. Flamm (1988), and Usselman (1993) showed that Sperry’s attempt to design and
patent basic approaches to computing, in an effort to establish and sustain dominant market
positions early at the outset of the computer revolution failed miserably. The pace and
breadth of technical change was so overwhelming that Sperry’s patents would be obsolete
almost immediately after being granted. Usselman (1993) shows that it was IBM, without
being a particularly outstanding technological innovator, which was able to conquer a large
pie of the emerging computer market. And the reasons had more to do with Teece’s (1986)
complementary assets than with technological innovative capability.
Therefore, as Mathews (1996) has argued, contrary to the traditional “strategy and
structure” thinking of organization theory, successful and innovative firms have attributes
such as flexibility, adaptability, responsiveness, that translate into a capacity to innovate
rapidly. To encompass these new attributes the term “organizational learning” has been advanced. Extending the concept of “learning”, which is traditionally used for human beings,

<-----Page 4----->P. Conceição et al. / J. Eng. Technol. Manage. 19 (2002) 25–38

29

into organizations has its challenges. In the broadest sense, we will follow Mathews (1996)
definition whereby organizational learning is equated with a firm ability to accommodate
changes (e.g. of products, technologies, markets).
To systematize further our concept of organizational learning, we will identify three
elements: information, people, and organizational units. Here, the term “organizational
unit” is the most ambiguous. It can stand for an entire small firm (without any structural
divisions) or for a division within a large corporation. As a working definition, we will
say that it is the smallest unit within a firm with a very high level of autonomy. People
correspond, obviously, to the individuals that work in the firm. Here, we will be interested
primarily in their level of knowledge and potential for learning, which economists often
call human capital. Finally, information stands for all the codified knowledge in the firm
that is formalized, such as contracts, patents, production processes, R&D in progress, and
so forth. Here, we include also all the machinery, computers, and other physical assets, or
what is called physical capital.
Learning occurs both at people level and at unit level. People learn by increasing their
human capital (through education, training, experience, expanding their networks of personal contacts). Learning at the unit level is reflected in increased productivity, resulting
from scale-effects, better communication, and establishment of routines, among other possibilities. Typically, both of these types of learning should also be reflected in an increase
in the stock of codified knowledge of the firm, even if much remains tacit. Organizational
learning is the result of this increase in the stock of codified knowledge, human capital,
and unit-level productivity. Encompassing the way people and units learn is the system
of incentives, rules of conduct, guidelines and informal norms of behavior that surround
the firm’s activity. For better of a better word, we will call this context the firm’s culture.
But organizational learning, that is, learning at the firm level, goes beyond the mere aggregation of individual and unit-level learning: it results from the interaction of people
and units across the firm. It depends on the relationships and networks that are established
between people and units, within the context provided by the firm’s culture and its market
and external environment. For a discussion on economic learning see also Conceição and
Heitor (2001).
Given this framework of analysis, the remaining of the paper proceeds with a case study
of one of the 3M’s efforts to enhance organizational learning. Section 2 will describe,
precisely, 3M’s culture, which we classify as being oriented towards innovation. We will
show in detail how 3M’s structure, strategy, system of incentives, and informal rules of
behavior are oriented towards innovation. A major, and important, feature of this system
is the high level of decentralization of 3M’s divisions. These divisions correspond to the
“units” of our conceptual framework described above. 3M’s culture of innovation has been
extremely successful at promoting individual and unit-level learning. The high level of autonomy granted to its divisions allowed just the characteristics needed to innovate: flexibility,
adaptability, and responsiveness, without the encumbrances of a large hierarchy. However,
while learning at the people and unit levels has largely been optimized, a perception emerged
that firm-wise learning could be enhanced. Section 3 describes a deliberate effort by 3M to
promote organizational learning, that is, learning at the firm level, beyond the individual units
and employees. Since this effort is still underway, Section 4 presents a brief discussion of
preliminary conclusions.

2. The culture of innovation at 3M
3M, founded in 1902 in Two Harbours, MN, is today recognized around the globe as one
of the world’s most innovative and admired companies. 3M is a US$ 15 billion 2 manufacturing company with over 70,000 employees 3 worldwide and more than 60,000 products
organized in two main business sectors: “life science sector” and the “industrial and consumer sector”. Its products, which are the result of 3M’s strategy of building in its more
than 30 core technology platforms (Table 2) instead of focusing on a single strategic core
competence, range from adhesives, pharmaceuticals, to overhead projectors, abrasives and
much more.
3M’s innovation culture comes from the times when the five entrepreneurs who created a
company to explore a mine of what they thought being corundum, 4 realized that all they had
was a low grade anorthosite, which would not meet the requirements of the booming abrasive
industry as they initially believed. Quickly they had to adapt and focus on producing sandpaper products. But it was with McKnight, who joined the company in 1907 has a bookkeeper
and later would become Chairman for more than 40 years, that 3M really developed a culture towards systematic innovation. Since then, 3M has been characterized by McKnight’s
principles of supportive management which encourages employee initiative and innovation.
The following is an analysis of the creative and innovative acts of management used
by 3M to promote innovation within the company, according to the model proposed by
Kozmetzky (as discussed in Carbonara, 1998). On the innovation strategy at 3M see also
Figueroa and Conceição (2000).

2.1. Strategy
3M managers take Peters’ words that “only the companies that thrive on chaos by constant
innovation are the only ones set to survive in the years to come” (Peters, 1997), very seriously.
Coyne, 3M Senior VP, Research & Development, says that while for other companies
innovation is an important element of their strategies, for 3M innovation is its strategy
(Coyne, 1997). Innovation is so important for 3M that is clearly stated in its vision “To be
the most innovative company in the markets it serves”. To promote that innovative spirit
3M has been driven by the following set of strategies.
• 30%/4 Rule: This rule states that each year 30% of 3M’s sales must result from products
introduced in the last 4 years.
• 15% Rule: One of the most important principles in management at 3M is the promotion
of entrepreneurship and freedom to pursue innovative ideas. At 3M that is materialized
through the “15% rule”, which allows technical people to spend 15% of their time in
projects of their own choosing without needing approvals or even without having to tell
management in what are they working on.
• Products are a division’s responsibility: Each division is oriented directly towards the
market, aiming at responding to its customer base.
• Technologies are shared throughout the company: While products’ responsibility lies
within each division, technologies belong to the company. Every division has access to
the technology resources of the entire company but also has the responsibility to share
its customers technological needs throughout 3M.
• Technology combinations: 3M promotes the combination of its core technologies in order
to advantage of those synergies to innovate new products and new applications.
• Strong intellectual property protection.
Furthermore, in order for 3M to prioritize major new programs and allocate the needed
resources to bring them to market sooner, it also sponsors the “Pacing Plus Initiative”. Under
this program, each division is encouraged to develop one or two products that will change
the basis of competition, increase sales and profitability, eliminate low-value projects and
produce growth. Products that qualify for the Pacing Plus Initiative program will be given
additional financial support and access to other resources. To qualify for the Pacing Plus
Initiative, a program must meet all the criteria below: 5
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

2.2. Culture and environment
3M’s culture is based in McKnight management principles laid out in 1948. More than
a great manager McKnight was also a business philosopher, who crated a corporate culture
that encourages employee initiative, entrepreneurship and innovation. The following are
the basic rules of management he laid out in 1948: 6
As our business grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to delegate responsibility and
to encourage men and women to exercise their initiative. This requires considerable
tolerance. Those men and women to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if
they are good people, are going to want to do their jobs in their own way.
Mistakes will be made. But if a person is essentially right, the mistakes he or she makes
are not as serious in the long run as the mistakes management will make if it undertakes
to tell those in authority exactly how they must do their jobs.
Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And
it’s essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow.
• Failure is part of the innovation process: Tolerance for ideas that do not work and learning
from mistakes is an integral part of 3M’s culture of innovation, where failure is seen as
a learning experience.
• Informality: 3M is open, informal and in a first name basis.
• Entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship: Evolutionary spin-offs have developed a key role
in 3M’s growth. 3M also fosters innovation by allowing the formation of both formal
and informal new venture teams. These teams, which are composed by manufacturing,
engineering and marketing full-time volunteers, have the ability to stay together if a
product proves to be successful. These may represent the first steps towards a new business
unit. New venture teams are ruled by the principle of start small, learn how a business
works and then expand “make a little, sell a little”.
• Diversified technological base.
• Technology exchange within the company.
• Customer driven innovation: 3M has a strong commitment to develop products driven
by the marketplace. Since its early days that 3M realized that in order to create products
that really satisfy the customers needs, both sales representatives and technical people had to be in frequent contact with the customers where the products were being
used. It was again McKnight as a Sales Manager who understood that a salesman would
have a better chance of providing competitive products if he could get into the factory
floors, talk to the workmen who used those products, and understand exactly what were
his needs and explain him how 3M products were superior to the competition. This
way 3M identifies the customer problems, anticipate their needs and develop innovative
solutions.
All of these aspects promote a culture that emphasizes risk taking, teamwork, innovation
and entrepreneurship.

2.3. Networks
Communication is an essential part of 3M success. To facilitate the communication
between technical people, marketing, sales, manufacturing and customers, 3M encourages
formally and informally networking activities that will assure coordinated actions.
The following are some of the means through which 3M creates conditions to an efficient
interaction and cooperation among its employees, internal organizations and customers.
• 3M’s Technical Forum: Organization to which all technical people belong and where
they share technology, best practices, policies and procedures. Besides its lectures and
problem solving sessions, the Technical Forum also sponsors an annual event where all
the divisions show their latest products and technologies, and also sponsors specialized
chapters in different technical areas.
• Exchange of personal between divisions and countries: It is a common practice at 3M to
see engineers and other personal come to US labs and US personal go oversees to help
introducing new products or new technologies.
• Infrastructure to facilitate communication: 3M takes advantage of the latest technologies
to promote communication and interactivity between teams. At 3M, the usage of tools
like groupware applications, teleconference and videoconference equipment is a common practice within the entire company. 3M also has its own internal TV to disseminate
corporate information, values and messages, which is also used for distance education
(seminars or courses). Furthermore, even the facilities are designed to facilitate the
interaction between people from different divisions and different functions.
2.4. Organizational form
At 3M each division is managed as an individual company. This decentralization into
small and autonomous business units allows them to minimize bureaucracy and concentrate
on new ideas and their own customer base. Typically, the creation of a business unit is
the result of the consolidation of a new product team. When a 3Mer has an idea for a
new product, he or she recruits a team of members from technical areas, manufacturing,
marketing and sales. The team designs the product and plans how to manufacture, market
and sell it. All members of the team grow according to the project growth. Some of them
become departments, some become divisions, while their project leaders become department
managers or division managers. As a result, although 3M is big it acts small.
2.5. Motivations and incentives
At 3M, recognition is done through formal and informal mechanisms. In addition to the
common tools to promote creativity and innovation, like salary increases and promotions,
nothing is so effective as assuring that dedication, hard work and success are recognized
both by peers and senior management. In this context, 3M developed the following serious
of programs and awards to recognize its most valuable employees:
• Golden Step Award: Recognizes teams whose new products have achieved US$ 5 million
in profitable sales within 3 years of being launched.

<-----Page 9----->34

P. Conceição et al. / J. Eng. Technol. Manage. 19 (2002) 25–38

• Technical Circle of Excellence: Recognizes technical employees who excel in their work.
These awardees are nominated by the entire technical community.
• Carlton Society: Honorary organization of individuals who made extraordinary contributions to 3M’s science and technology.
• Genesis Grants: Corporate grants to support ideas which do not fit into the technical
people’s division.
• Alpha Grants: Grants awarded for innovations in administrative, marketing and nontechnical areas.

3. Case study: the Electronic Markets Center
and the 3M electronic business
In 1995, worldwide 3M sales to the electronic industry were approximately US$ 1 billion
or about 10% of 3M’s total sales. These sales were addressing an estimated total worldwide
electronics industry of US$ 800 billion and an available market for 3M products of at least
US$ 20 billion.
3M’s approach to this market has been very fragmented, mainly based on individual
products and divisions focus. As a result of a lack of coordination between the business
units and the consequent duplication of efforts, 3M was not leveraging its broad range of
products and technologies in the electronic industry and was observing frequent signs of
customer dissatisfaction that often decreases customer loyalty. As another consequence of
that fragmentation 3M’s brands and products and technology presence within the electronic
industry was also diluted.
One of 3M’s greatest strengths is the autonomy and independence of its some 45 divisions,
each able to respond quickly in its business arena, assisted by corporate technology centers
and other resources, but not handcuffed by large organizational structure. Over a dozen
of these divisions have found the electronics industry to be attractive opportunity for their
products, especially due to higher industry growth when compared to some of their other
industrial market segments. These divisions have thus evolved a very curious and interesting
portfolio in electronics, albeit one that grew accidentally, and without purposeful focus on
electronics customers needs. In particular, since business engagement was being managed by
business units which were on the average about 25% focused on electronics, most customer
activity received only fractionated attention and very little cross-division partnering took
place.
In February 1997, the 3M Electronic Markets Center was created to help 3M position in
the electronics industry by driving a one company—one voice initiative in the electronic
business. Although the overall growth of the electronic industry exceeds 12% per year
globally, and some segments are growing even faster at 20–40% per year, 3M growth had
not kept up with these industry levels. The challenge for this new organization was to help
change the growth rate of 3M’s sales to the electronic industry from 9 or 10% per year to
well over 20% per year, with a goal of achieving a US$ 10 billion 3M sales volume to the
electronics industry in 2006.
In this context, the EMC was designed to put in place processes to achieve the established
goals through three main strategies:

<-----Page 10----->P. Conceição et al. / J. Eng. Technol. Manage. 19 (2002) 25–38

35

1. Leverage 3M’s broad product portfolio in key accounts to accelerate growth of existing
and modified products. This “sell what we’ve got” portfolio management strategy focuses
on making it easier for customer decision makers to access and use the rich broad selection
of 3M products.
2. Identify through close key account involvement, opportunities to leverage 3M’s breath
in technologies to sponsor and improve the probability of success of products new to
the world which address real customer problems. This strategy emphasizes deep understanding of customer needs by segment and linking those needs to potential solutions
from multiple 3M technology sources.
3. Identify gaps in 3M’s product and technology portfolios, with respect to industry needs,
and drive alliances/acquisitions to fill them.
In order to drive 3M to the desired growth objectives in the electronics industry initiatives were focused in four industry segments which are growing rapidly and which offer
opportunities for a majority of the divisions related with the EMC. Those segments were:
storage systems, semiconductors, display systems and printed circuit board fabrication and
assembly. These segments each offer significant growth, key accounts running similar manufacturing processes, needs for technology solutions and they each exhibit opportunities
across a number of 3M division.
3M’s business in electronics spans a wide variety of products including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Board and cabinet interconnect: copper, Co–Ax, fiber.
PC and flex circuit component interconnect, sequencing tapes, EMI control.
Flip-chip, MBGA, micro-interconnect to chip.
Chip and wafer processing; micro-abrasives, specialty chemicals, static control, electrooptic packaging.
Vibration control, special tapes and adhesives.
Brightness enhancing films, optical films.

About 60% of 3M’s sales to electronics are outside the US and are supported very heavily
by 3M’s global organization. Divisions are headquartered in the US; 5 in Austin, Texas and
the remaining 40 in St. Paul, MN. These divisions are headed by General Managers who
have global P&L responsibility for their products. For the past 50 years, 3M has been
building a strong international organization, with wholly owned subsidiaries in over 80
countries, structured to support those global divisions with local logistics, sales/marketing,
manufacturing and technical organizations driving country-specific customer satisfaction.
This is a complex task, handled by a complex organizational structure, but the traditional
“think global—act local” approach has worked well for 3M over the years.
As the EMC was created, the need for global emphasis was forefront, as the electronics
industry is made up of a complex shifting pattern of technology and manufacturing regional
strengths and competencies. Thus, regional EMCs were put in place for Europe, Japan and
the southeast Asia region, with directors reporting to the global EMC in Austin, Texas.
Addressing the challenge of better focusing 3M on electronics, and building understanding and intimacy with the industry, the EMC was structured to provide that leadership
for 3M. An industry marketing organization was put in place to provide, for 3M, overall

industry insight, market segmentation and industry consortial involvements. In each selected
segment, technical marketing teams provide segment insight and foresight through technology and process roadmapping, leadership participation in segment industry and standards
organizations, and overall 3M portfolio management strategies and priorities. In addition,
in each selected segment, strong technical sales leaders have been assigned as key Account
Managers for each major customer to provide a single point of presence for both existing
product access and technology problem solving for the accounts.
One of the strongest elements of the EMC approach is the identification of a number of
corporate strategic accounts. These make up the top 20 electronics OEMs in the world. Each
of these have assigned to them a Strategic Account Director or Manager responsible for:
Providing a single channel for these most important customers.
Promote 3M’s total capabilities.
Align 3M’s major programs to customer’s present and future business needs.
Deploy 3M global resource to support customer’s global operation.
Present 3M’s value-add solution package.
These account leaders have put teams in place to ensure that all engagement ranging from
daily support of purchasing and logistics issues all the way to management of joint technology development programs are managed smoothly and coordinated across all of 3M.
The EMC initiative is clearly a departure from the typical 3M approach of product driven
divisions moving into new markets leveraging niche applications from earlier served “home
markets”. That traditional approach was not working until the EMC addressed specifically
the challenge of enabling 14 divisions working together to leverage 3M’s broad technical
offer in electronics, to be closer to the market and to deal with the customer with one single
face. Table 3 lists the divisions involved. The challenges of totally gaining that leverage
while maintaining division autonomy and ability to act are not easy to overcome!
Attempting to accelerate the technology commercialization process through customer
foresight driven compelling business cases only works easily if control is centered in a
single business unit, not dispersed among several. Integration of the efforts of these business
units in electronics is well underway.

4. Conclusions
The EMC initiative exemplifies 3M’s efforts to maintain its innovation leadership through
changes in its organizational structure and strategy. Drawing from the strengths of its culture
and organization a new unit, EMC, was created to coordinate 3M’s response to pressing
market needs in a growing sector. The point we would like to stress is that there was a need
for some higher level of coordination (beyond the division level) to achieve 3M’s intended
integrated response. While the strategy behind the establishment of highly responsible and
autonomous divisions has shown to be sound and effective, the identification of a very
large growth opportunity in the global electronic industry could not be addressed with the
fragmented divisional market approach.
This 3M case study illustrates that organizational change to enhance innovation and
creativity does not necessarily go in the direction of creating smaller and more fragmented
units. Often it is more important to enhance the networks and connections among existing
organizational units to provide a more coherent firm-wide response to market needs.
