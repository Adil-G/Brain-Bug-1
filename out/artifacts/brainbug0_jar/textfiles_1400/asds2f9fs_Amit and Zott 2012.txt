Creating Value Through
Business Model Innovation
Could your company benefit from a new business model? Consider these six questions.
By Raphael Amit and Christoph Zott

The leading
question

Companies often make substantial efforts to innovate their processes and products to
achieve revenue growth and to maintain or improve profit margins. Innovations to improve processes and products, however, are often expensive and time-consuming, requiring a considerable
upfront investment in everything from research and development to specialized resources, new
plants and equipment, and even entire new business units. Yet future returns on these investments
are always uncertain. Hesitant to make such big bets, more companies now are turning toward business model innovation as an alternative or complement to product or process innovation.
A recent global survey of more than 4,000 senior managers by the Economist Intelligence Unit
found that the majority (54%) favored new business models over new products and services as a
source of future competitive advantage. EIU analysts concluded that “the overall message is clear:
The growing popularity of e-reading devices
such as the Kindle is stimulating business
how companies do business will often be as, or
model changes in book publishing.
1 And in a simmore, important than what they do.”
ilar global study conducted by IBM, in which over
750 corporate and public sector leaders were interviewed on the subject of innovation, researchers
found that “competitive pressures have pushed
business model innovation much higher than expected on CEOs’ priority lists.”2 However, this level
of interest may not have been too surprising given
that the IBM study also found that companies
whose operating margins had grown faster than
their competitors’ over the previous five years were
twice as likely to emphasize business model innovation, as opposed to product or process innovation.3
One CEO explained why his company’s focus on
business model innovation had grown:

Business model innovation can also help companies stay ahead in the product innovation game,
where as one CEO from another study explained,
“you’re always one innovation away from getting
wiped out by a new competing innovation that
eliminates the need for your product.” 5 A good
product that is embedded in an innovative business
model, however, is less easily shunted aside. Someone might come up with a better MP3 player than
Apple’s tomorrow, but few of the hundreds of millions of consumers with iPods and iTunes accounts
will be open to switching brands.
Business model innovation matters to managers, entrepreneurs and academic researchers for
several reasons. First, it represents an often underutilized source of future value. Second, competitors
might find it more difficult to imitate or replicate
an entire novel activity system than a single novel
product or process. Since it is often relatively easier
to undermine and erode the returns of product or
process innovation, innovation at the level of the
business model can sometimes translate into a sustainable performance advantage. Third, because
business model innovation can be such a potentially powerful competitive tool, managers must be
attuned to the possibility of competitors’ efforts in
this area.6 Competitive threats often come from
outside their traditional industry boundaries.

About the Research
The ideas presented in this article are anchored in the authors’ decade-long research
program on business models. We started this research with in-depth inquiries into
the business models of 59 e-business companies in Europe and the U.S. that had
undertaken initial public offerings. Under our guidance, several research analysts
investigated each company, using approximately 50 open-ended questions. The
analysts wrote up the answers to the questions using information gathered from
multiple data sources (such as IPO prospectuses), which we then took to develop an
inductive theory on the sources of value creation in e-business.
In our subsequent work, we shifted attention from value creation to value appropriation by linking some of the value drivers of business models (notably, novelty and
efficiency) to company performance. To test our hypotheses, we developed a unique
data set containing detailed information about the business models of 190 entrepreneurial companies listed on U.S. or European public exchanges between 1996 and
2000. We measured each business model design theme as a variable at a particular
point in time, and we regressed these variables on a range of performance measures.
We also supplemented these data on companies’ business models with a manually collected data set on business strategy, establishing empirically that a company’s product
market strategy and its business model are distinct constructs that affect performance.
More recently, we developed cases on business model choice and evolution. These
cases have given us additional insights that have led to further conceptual advances.
Building on these advances in this article, we focus for the first time squarely on business model innovation in the context of established companies rather than start-ups.

We define a company’s business model as a system
of interconnected and interdependent activities that
determines the way the company “does business” with
its customers, partners and vendors. In other words, a
business model is a bundle of specific activities — an
activity system — conducted to satisfy the perceived
needs of the market, along with the specification of
which parties (a company or its partners) conduct
which activities, and how these activities are linked to
each other. We started our research into business
models a decade ago by making in-depth inquiries
into the business models of 59 e-business companies
in Europe and the U.S. that had undertaken initial
public offerings.7 (See “About the Research.”) Later,
we developed a unique data set containing detailed information about the business models of 190
entrepreneurial companies listed on U.S. or European
public exchanges between 1996 and 2000. We supplemented these data on companies’ business models
with another manually collected data set on business
strategy, establishing empirically that a company’s
product market strategy and its business model are
distinct constructs that affect corporate performance.8 More recently, we have developed cases on
business model choice and evolution.9
Building on this work, we focus in this article on
business model innovation in the context of established companies. However, these ideas are equally
applicable to innovators of entirely new business
models and to managers of companies who need to
adapt their business model incrementally with the objective of achieving business model innovation new to
their organization. Even under conditions of resource
scarcity, organizations do not need to renounce innovation as a way of enhancing their performance
prospects. Rather, managers should consider the opportunities offered by business model innovation to
complement, if not substitute for, innovation in products or processes. Business model innovation can
allow managers to resolve the apparent trade-off between innovation costs and benefits by addressing
how they do business, for example, by involving partners in new value-creating activity systems.

Business Model
Innovation in Practice
To illustrate the power of business model innovation,
consider two cases: Apple and HTC, the Taiwansloanreview.mit.edu

for most of its history, apple was focused on the production of innovative
hardware and software, mostly personal computers. By creating the ipod
and the associated itunes, a legal online music download service, apple
introduced a radical innovation of its
business model. apple was the first
computer company to include music
distribution as an activity, linking it to
the development of the ipod hardware
and software. By adding this new activity to its business model, which links
the music label owners with end users,
apple transformed music distribution. Rather than growing by simply
bringing innovative new hardware to
the market, apple transformed its
business model to encompass an ongoing relationship with its customers,
similar to the “razor and blade” model
of companies such as Gillette. this enabled apple, and its business model
partners, to extract ongoing value
from the use of the apple hardware
and software. in this way, apple expanded the locus of its innovation
from the product space to the business
model — and its revenues, profit and stock price
change have reflected that successful business model
innovation. (see “apple’s performance, Before and
after Business model Changes.”)
such performance can be hard for even some
otherwise high-performing companies to match if
they rely solely on product innovation. HtC has
been a very innovative, profitable and growing original equipment manufacturer since its founding in
1997. initially, HtC manufactured handsets for microsoft-powered mobile phones for companies such
as palm, Hp and t-mobile. in 2006, it changed its
product-market strategy from being a contract
oem manufacturer to selling its own HtC-branded
smart phones to wireless network operators and the
general public through various distribution channels. HtC has excelled in many ways, recording
many firsts in the smart phone product market space
and winning numerous awards for its many technosloanreVIeW.mIt.edu

logical innovations. Yet HtC’s business model has
remained centered on hardware design and product
innovation. in effect, HtC sells great razors, but no
razor blades: its business model allows it to benefit
only from the sale of its innovative, state-of-the-art
smart phones and tablets, but not from their use.
Comparing the performance of HtC and apple
stock in the past two years highlights the fact that in
the fast-moving technology market space, product
innovation without business model innovation may
not always provide enough competitive advantage.
(see “the stock price of HtC vs. apple,” p. 44.)
in contrast to apple, HtC has not been involved in
the creation or delivery of mobile content or services,

how to innovate in
Business model design
an innovative business model can either create a
new market or allow a company to create and exploit new opportunities in existing markets. Dell,
for example, implemented a customer-driven,
build-to-order business model that replaced the
traditional build-to-stock model of selling computers through retail stores.10
Changes to business model design, however, can
be subtle; even when they might not have the potential to disrupt an industry, they can still yield
important benefits to the innovator. Consider taco
Bell, the restaurant chain offering mexican-style fast
food, which in the late 1980s decided to turn the restaurant’s kitchens into heating and assembly units.
most chopping, cooking and clean-up activities were
transferred to corporate headquarters. the food was
sent precooked in plastic bags to restaurants, where
it could be heated, assembled and served.11 this incremental business model innovation was not
game-changing for the fast food industry, but it

allowed taco Bell to realize economies of scale and
improvements in efficiency and quality control, as
well as to increase space for customers within the
restaurants. 12 other companies might wish to
change their business models in similar incremental
ways or follow a business model innovator in their
industry in order to achieve competitive parity.
Business model innovation can occur in a number of ways:
1. By adding novel activities, for example, through
forward or backward integration; we refer to this
form of business model innovation as new activity system “content.”13
2. By linking activities in novel ways; we refer to this
form of business model innovation as new activity system “structure.”
3. By changing one or more parties that perform
any of the activities; we refer to this form of business model innovation as new activity system
“governance.”
Content, structure and governance are the three
design elements that characterize a company’s
business model.14 (see “six Questions about Business model innovation.”) Change one or more of
these elements enough and you’ve changed the
model. Consider the following.
The content of an activity system refers to the selection of activities to be performed. for example,
Colombia’s largest bank, Bancolombia, adopted activities beyond those of a typical retail bank. the
perceived market need for these activities was the demand for microcredit among the more than 60% of
Colombians who did not have access to banking services. to perform these new activities — an
innovation in the content of its business model — the
bank needed to train its top management, hire and
train new staff and link the new activities to its existing system (platforms, applications and channels).15
another example of business model innovation focused on content is iBm.16 after a severe financial
crisis in the early 1990s, the company shifted its focus
from being a supplier of hardware to becoming a service provider. Drawing on know-how built over
decades, iBm launched a range of new activities in
consulting, it maintenance and other services. the
transformation was substantial: By 2009, more than
half of iBm’s $96 billion in revenues came from these
activities, which had barely existed 15 years earlier.

<-----Page 5----->The structure of an activity system describes how
the activities are linked and in what sequence. Consider Priceline.com. This online travel agency has
established links with airline companies, credit card
companies and Travelport’s Worldspan central reservation system, among others. By introducing a
reverse market in which customers post desired
prices for sellers’ acceptance, Priceline developed a
fundamentally novel exchange mechanism through
which these parties interact and by which items such
as airline tickets are sold. Priceline was granted a
business method patent on its innovative activity
system — a novel structure that continues to distinguish the company from other travel agencies.
The governance of an activity system refers to who
performs the activities. Franchising, for example,
represents one possible approach to innovative activity system governance. It can be the key to
unlocking value, as when Japanese entrepreneur Toshifumi Suzuki realized in the early 1970s that the
franchise system that had developed in the U.S. was
an ideal response to the strict regulations imposed
by the Japanese government on retailing outlets,
which limited their size and restricted opening
times. By franchising 7-Eleven stores in Japan,
Suzuki adopted a novel type of activity system governance (new to Japan, but not to the rest of the
world) and managed to create value through professional management and local adaptation.17 Another
example of an innovative governance structure is
the recent formation of a consortium of magazine
publishers, including Time, Hearst, Meredith and
Condé Nast, to develop an online magazine newsstand using multiple digital formats. The resulting
company, Next Issue Media, is jointly owned by industry rivals and is a response by the rival publishers
to declining print circulation (and hence print advertising revenue) and the growth of digital media.
Fighting for survival, the publishers are looking beyond their otherwise fierce competition to their
common interest in inventing a new context for
magazines in the digital era. As Ann Moore, the former CEO of Time, stated, “It’s increasingly clear that
finding the right digital business model is crucial for
the future of our business.”18
But how does a company increase the odds of
developing the right business model for its situation? In our earlier work,19 we identified four major

interlinked value drivers of business models: novelty, lock-in, complementarities and efficiency.
 ovelty captures the degree of business model in1. N
novation that is embodied by the activity system.
2. Lock-in refers to those business model activities
that create switching costs or enhanced incentives for business model participants to stay and
transact within the activity system. Consider for
example Nespresso, a division of Nestlé Corporation. It introduced a new, low-cost espresso
maker that uses Nespresso-produced coffee capsules. Once a customer buys a Nespresso
machine, he or she needs to use Nespresso coffee
capsules — creating a lock-in that enables Nestle
to profit from both the sale of the machine and
the use of the machine by selling consumables
that machine owners must buy from Nespresso.
Launching these products involved a radical redesign of the activity system, for example, by
branching out into retailing activities.
3. Complementarities refer to the value-enhancing effect of the interdependencies among business
model activities. Consider, for example, eBay,
which offers a platform to conduct sales over the
Internet among individual buyers and sellers of
used and new products. A key requirement for the
platform to function properly is a payment mechanism that allows buyers to make credit card
payments even when the seller does not have access

<-----Page 6----->S t r at e g y i n C h a n g i n g M a r k e t s : N e w B u s i n e ss M o d e l s

to credit card services. PayPal, the online payment
company that eBay acquired, offers such a function, facilitating trades that could not otherwise be
completed. In other words, PayPal has a value-enhancing effect on the eBay activity system.
4. Efficiency refers to cost savings through the interconnections of the activity system. Consider
Wal-Mart, which not only championed the concept
of discount retailing but also designed an activity
system that supports its low-cost strategy. An important activity within this system is logistics. Over
time, Wal-Mart developed highly sophisticated
processes, such as cross-docking, unrivalled in the
industry. These processes help the company to keep
its costs lower than its competitors, giving WalMart an important competitive advantage.
Our research suggests that the presence of each of
these value drivers enhances the value-creation potential of a business model. Moreover, we find
important synergies among the value drivers. Complementarities, for example, can be more valuable
when supported by novel business model design.

Interdependencies in
Business Models
Interdependencies in business models are created by
entrepreneurs or managers in several ways: when
they choose the set of organizational activities they
consider relevant to satisfying a perceived market
need, when they design the links that weave activities
together into a system and when they shape the governance mechanisms that hold the system together.
Interdependence among business model design
elements. Content, structure and governance can be
highly interdependent. Take the San Francisco, California-based peer-to-peer lending company Prosper,
for example. The venture aims at enabling direct,
small, unsecured loans between individual lenders
and borrowers. Early on, the founders made the conscious decision to let lenders choose the borrowers
to whom they wanted to lend their money. This was
a structural choice that settled the question of how
lending and borrowing activities were linked, but it
also constituted a decision about governance because it shifted the evaluation and selection activities
to the customers and away from the company.
Interdependencies between business and revenue models. Managers also need to consider the
46 MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW SPRING 2012

A12-MI1-003 Zott.indd 46

interdependency between a company’s business
model and its revenue model. The revenue model refers to the specific ways a business model enables
revenue generation for the business and its partners.20
It is the way in which the organization appropriates
some of the value that is created by the business model
for all its stakeholders. A revenue model complements
a business model design, just as a pricing strategy
complements a product design. Consider Better Place,
whose business model aims to provide electric vehicle
charging services. Like a mobile phone operator
whose business model centers on enabling the use of
the mobile phone device through its network rather
than on the handset device itself, Better Place’s business model centers on providing charging networks
and services rather than on the electric vehicle itself.
It involves an innovative business model structure
with partners ranging from governments, vehicle
manufacturers, clean energy producers and others.
Just as mobile phone operators charge customers
variable or flat rates for telecommunication services,
Better Place intends to implement a revenue model
as a function of customers’ car usage (miles driven),
thus taking into account the interdependency between its business and revenue models.21
The concepts of business and revenue model, although conceptually distinct, may be quite closely
related and even inextricably intertwined. For example, in the product world, Gillette uses its pricing
strategy of selling inexpensive razors to make customers buy its more expensive blades. A business
model lays the foundations for a company’s value
capture by codefining (along with the company’s
products and services) the overall “size of the value
pie” (that is, the total value that is created), which can
be considered an upper limit to the company’s value
capture.22 The greater the total value created through
the innovative business model, and the greater a
company’s bargaining power, the greater the amount
of value that the company can appropriate.23
Caveats. As the Better Place example suggests,
business model innovators need to bear in mind that
identifying technologically or strategically distinct
activities can be conceptually challenging, because
the number of potential activities is often quite
large.24 Many seemingly inseparable activities can
now be broken down even further, especially given
ongoing advances in information and communicasloanreview.mit.edu

3/6/12 9:49 AM

<-----Page 7----->tions technologies.25 (This, of course, represents not
only a conceptual challenge but also an opportunity
for innovative managers to redesign the activity systems of their organizations in novel ways.)
What’s more, making changes to a company’s
whole activity system rather than optimizing individual activities (such as production) requires
systemic and holistic thinking, which can be demanding. When responding to a crisis, operating in
tough economic times or taking advantage of a new
opportunity, rethinking an entire business model
may not always be the first thing on a manager’s
mind. This is particularly true when the level of
resistance to change is predicted to be high. As a result, choices on business model design often go
unchallenged for a long time.

Six Questions to Ask Before
Launching a New Model
Our research shows that in a highly interconnected
world, especially one in which financial resources
are scarce, entrepreneurs and managers must look
beyond the product and process and focus on ways
to innovate their business model. A fresh business
model can create and exploit opportunities for new
revenue and profit streams in ways that counteract
an aging model that has tied a company into a cycle
of declining revenues and pressures on profit margins.26 We suggest that managers ask themselves the
following six key questions as they consider business model innovation:
1. What perceived needs can be satisfied through
the new model design?
2. What novel activities are needed to satisfy these perceived needs? (business model content innovation)
3. How could the required activities be linked to
each other in novel ways? (business model structure innovation)
4. Who should perform each of the activities that are
part of the business model? Should it be the company? A partner? The customer? What novel
governance arrangements could enable this structure? (business model governance innovation)
5. How is value created through the novel business
model for each of the participants?
6. What revenue model fits with the company’s
business model to appropriate part of the total
value it helps create?

A12-MI1-003 Zott.indd 47

To illustrate how managers might productively
and proactively use these questions, consider the
business model of McGraw-Hill’s book publishing
business.27 In the U.S., general and trade books (including consumer titles and celebrity author
books) represent about 55% of industry revenues,
while academic and professional books generate
the remainder. Until recently, only in business-tobusiness and academic text segments have websites
been a true marketing platform for digital content.
While e-readers such as the Kindle and the iPad are
now rapidly gaining popularity, the time-consuming and expensive book publishing process had not
changed in a material manner in many decades.
However, Google, Amazon and other competing
information and content providers have stimulated
a growing customer interest in electronic formats.
Publishers in the U.S. and Europe are searching for
solutions to meet the emergent demand for creating and delivering digital content on portable
devices while preserving and enhancing value.
Meeting the demand for digital content may require publishers to perform new activities (new
business model content). Although it is unlikely that
the traditional hardback/paperback book will disappear, it is expected that the demand for printed
publications will fall sharply. If printing and physical distribution become less relevant in the process,
the time it now takes to add a new title to a catalogue and to bookstore shelves will be reduced.
Accordingly, designing, uploading and maintaining the most complete online catalogue may become

a central new activity in publishers’ business models.
In addition, to the extent that publishers decide to
bypass traditional retail bookstores in their new
business models, they will have to develop a new
marketing activity targeting retail buyers. Production will need to change as well. Creating content
with a digitally enabled streamlined process is another activity 21st-century publishers will probably
need to incorporate into their new business models.
Linking the various activities to each other, sequencing these linkages and deciding how
stakeholders will interact with one another in the
new business models requires careful consideration
(new business model structure). For example, the
ways in which McGraw-Hill decides to interact with
multiple digital distribution partners such as Apple
and Amazon, through which McGraw-Hill distributes digital content to retail consumers, will affect
the breadth of the company’s access to the retail
digital book market. The linkages among content
creators, including authors, editors, other publishing professionals and distributors, will constitute
the heart of the new business model. These linkages
must reflect alternatives available to authors — such
as bypassing publishers altogether — as well as approaches adopted by competing publishers.
48 MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW SPRING 2012

A12-MI1-003 Zott.indd 48

Determining whether McGraw-Hill
or another partner will carry out each of
the activities of the new business model
requires a careful consideration of tradeoffs (new business model governance). For
example, should the publisher’s content
be delivered through a new McGrawHill branded device, or by proprietary
devices offered by such partners as Amazon (with its Kindle) or Apple (with its
iPad), thereby leveraging their existing
position in the market? Or should its
content be delivered through Internetbased platforms compatible with a
broad range of devices, enabling global
distribution? These are crucial governance decisions that a new publishing
model will answer.
Publishers’ new business models will
create value through the complementarities and interdependence among
activities and through the enormous efficiencies in the publishing process that the new
business models could generate. A number of alternative revenue models associated with these new
business models could be considered, such as single
subscription pricing independent of the number of
downloaded manuscripts, piecemeal pricing and/or
value-based pricing for time-sensitive publications.
	

Taking a Systemic View

Addressing the six questions outlined above can help
managers see their companies’ identities more clearly
in the context of the networks and ecosystems in
which their organizations operate. Without a business
model perspective, a company is a mere participant in
a dizzying array of networks and passive entanglements. Adopting the business model perspective can
help executives purposefully structure the activity
systems of their companies; the purposeful design
and structuring of business models is a key task for
general managers and entrepreneurs and can be an
important source of innovation, helping the company look beyond its traditional sets of partners,
