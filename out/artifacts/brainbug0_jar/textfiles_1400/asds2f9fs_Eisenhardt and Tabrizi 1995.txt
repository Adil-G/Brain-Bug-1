achieving fast adaptation through product innovation.
The compression model assumes a well-known, rational
process and relies on squeezing together or compressing
the sequential steps of such a process. The experiential

U.S. computer firms. The results indicate that using an
experiential strategy of multiple design iterations,
extensive testing, frequent project milestones, a powerful
project leader, and a multifunctional team accelerates
product development. In contrast, the compression
strategy of supplier involvement, use of computer-aided
design, and overlapping development steps describes
fast pace only for mature industry segments. The results
also show that planning and rewarding for schedule
attainment are ineffective ways of accelerating pace. We
conclude with linkages to punctuated equilibrium and
selection models of adaptation, fast organizational
processes, organic versus improvisational structures, and
complexity theory.'

AcceleratingAdaptive
Processes: Product
Innovationin the Global
ComputerIndustry

Adaptationis a process of fundamentalinterest to
organizationalscholars. Historically,a debate has been
shaped by two extreme perspectives. One is that
organizationsare inertialand so are unableto change
significantly.The other is that organizationsare malleable
and can realignwith evolving conditions. More recently, this
debate has shifted from whether adaptationhappens to how
and when it occurs (Gersick,1994). Punctuatedequilibrium,
which centers on large, infrequent,structuralchanges to
achieve adaptation,has emerged as the dominantmodel of
such processes (Millerand Freisen, 1984; Romanelliand
Tushman, 1994). Yet, as others (Millerand Chen, 1994;
Brownand Eisenhardt,1995b) have observed, adaptation
can also occur throughsmall, frequent shifts in how firms
compete in the marketplace.

Productinnovationis a primaryway in which this alternative
form of adaptationcan happen. For many organizations,
creating new productsis a centralpath by which they adapt
and sometimes even transformthemselves in changing
environments(Womack,Jones, and Roos, 1990; Dougherty,
1992; Brownand Eisenhardt,1995a). Hewlett-Packard
transformedfrom an instrumentscompany to a computerbased one throughnew productdevelopment. Similarly,Intel
changed from a memory company to a microprocessorfirm
throughproductdevelopment (Burgelman,1991). Thus, in
the face of intense internationalcompetition, rapid
technology evolution,and customers' maturingexpectations,
productinnovationis a primaryway in which firms actually
adapt.
In recent years, fast adaptationhas become a pivotal,
strategic competence for many organizations(e.g.,
Eisenhardt,1989; Stalkand Hout, 1990). Not surprisingly
then, this same theme of fast pace has become criticalin
productinnovation.The evidence for the importanceof rapid
84/AdministrativeScience Quarterly,40 (1995): 84-110

productdevelopment to success is compelling.Vesey (1991)
reportedon a study of high-technologyproducts,showing
that productsthat were six months late in entering the
market,but were within budget, earned 33 percent less over
a five-yearperiodthan they would have if on time. Entering
the marketon time, even 50 percent over budget, reduced a
firm's profitabilityby only 4 percent for that product.
Moreover,fast productdevelopment is usuallymore
productiveand lower cost, because lengthy time in product
development tends to waste resources on peripheral
activities, changes, and mistakes (Stalkand Hout, 1990;
Clarkand Fujimoto,1991). Thus, althoughthere may be
pitfallsto rapidproductdevelopment (von Braun,1990), it is
often essential for the successful adaptationand, ultimately,
for the survivalof firms.
But how do firms develop productsquickly?Several previous
research streams providesome insights. One stream
synthesizes the experiences of the authors, often people
with decades of experience in productdevelopment (e.g.,
Gold, 1987; Rosenau, 1988; Stalkand Hout, 1990; Cordero,
1991; Vesey, 1991). Althoughthey typicallyhave little
systematic data or theoreticalfoundation,they do tend to
have captivatinganecdotes and many ideas for managerial
practice. Drawingon his extensive industrialexperience,
Rosenau (1988), for example, enumerated about 10 factors
that are organizedaroundthe key idea of shorteningthe
time of steps in the development process. Similarly,Cordero
(1991) drew on his industryexperience to emphasize the
use of computer-aideddesign (CAD)as well as careful
planningand targeted rewardsto accelerate product
development.
A second stream emphasizes impressionisticdata gathered
from managers engaged in productdevelopment (e.g., Gupta
and Wilemon, 1990; Mabert,Muth,and Schmenner, 1992;
McDonough,1993). Typically,the methodology involves
using surveys to gather the broad,general attitudes and
opinions of single informantswithin a firmabout fast product
development. Guptaand Wilemon (1990) surveyed 80
managers on the factors that they believed would speed up
and slow down productdevelopment. Among these factors
are the importanceof senior management support,
multifunctionalinvolvement,and detailed product
requirementsplanning.Millson,Raj,and Wilemon (1992)
extended this work to a rationalblueprintfor accelerating
new productdevelopment: (1) simplify,(2) eliminate delay,
(3) eliminatesteps, (4) speed up operations, and (5) perform
parallelprocesses.
A thirdresearch stream is characterizedby in-depthcase
studies or small-samplestudies conducted in global
industries,frequentlyemphasizingthe virtues of Japanese
management (e.g., Quinn,1985; Imai,Nonaka,and
Takeuchi,1985; Clark,Chew, and Fujimoto,1987; Womack,
Jones, and Roos, 1990; lansiti, 1992). Imai,Nonaka,and
Takeuchi(1985) studied five innovativeand successful
Japanese products,each representinga different
technology-based industry.The authors argued that an
involvedsuppliernetwork has the strongest effect on the
speed of development. In a later study, Clarkand his
85/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 3----->colleagues (Clark,Chew, and Fujimoto,1987; Hayes,
Wheelwright,and Clark,1988; Clarkand Fujimoto,1991)
found that supplierinvolvement,multifunctionalteams, and
overlappingproductdevelopment stages are among the
pivotaldeterminantsof rapidproductdevelopment in the
global automotive industry.
Takentogether, these research results outline broadfactors,
such as planning,the use of CAD,supplierinvolvement,
powerful projectleaders, and multifunctionalteams that
quickenthe pace of productdevelopment. This work gives
much needed insight into fast productdevelopment. Yet
these ideas often rest on impressionisticdata from the
authors'career experiences or managers' subjective
perceptions of productdevelopment processes. Although
the data underlyingthe thirdstream are more systematic,
even here, the theory is modest, the sample sizes are small,
and there is limitedor no multivariatetesting of hypotheses.
Also, since most of these studies emphasize the
management practices of successful Japanese companies,
often in the auto industry(e.g., Womack,Jones, and Roos,
1990; Clarkand Fujimoto,1991), their generalizabilityis
confounded by the questions of whether the results are
unique to Japan or to large, mechanicalassembly products.
In contrast to the research on fast productdevelopment, a
few authors have looked at pace outside of the product
development context. Bastien and Hostager (1988) explained
how jazz musicians reliedon improvisationto create
innovativemusic rapidly.Eisenhardt(1989) examined how
executives make fast strategic decisions in the high-velocity,
computer industry.Weick (1993) described how some
firefightersquicklyassessed a catastrophicsituationand
lived, while others perished. In each of these studies, the
situations are highlyuncertain,and the people involvedrely
on highlyexperientialand real-timeinformationin the
context of targeted structureto achieve fast pace. Unlikethe
productdevelopment research, this work suggests achieving
fast pace by relyingon iterativeexperiences, flexibility,and
improvisation.

This paper explores rapidadaptiveprocesses, focusing on
productinnovationas a crucialadaptive process. We create
two theoreticalmodels, one buildingon existing product
development research and the other relyingon findings that
emphasize real-timeexperience, flexibility,and improvisation.
We then examine them with data from 72 product
development projects from 36 Asian, U.S., and European
firms operatingin the fast-paced, global computer industry.
The computer industryis characterizedby short productlife
cycles, intense and internationalcompetition,an evolving
scientific base, and a lack of Japanese domination.It is a
high-velocityindustrywhere speed matters (Bourgeoisand
Eisenhardt,1988).
At a higherlevel, the paper attempts to open up organization
theory to a more dynamicconception of firms. Much of
organizationtheory is locked into static equilibriummodels,
such as transaction-costeconomics, resource dependence,
agency, and contingency theories. Even organization
ecology, which is dynamicat the populationlevel, is largely
86/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 4----->Adaptive Processes

inertialat the firm level, and models of change, such as
punctuatedequilibriumare, in fact, highlystatic. Yet fast
pace and quickadaptationhave emerged as central,
competitive capabilitiesfor contemporaryfirms (Eisenhardt,
1989; D'Aveni,1994; Galunicand Eisenhardt,1996). The
two theoreticalmodels developed here sketch potential
organizationalforms for creatingsuch core capabilities.We
also attempt to contributeto the innovationliteratureby
developing more theoreticallybased models of rapidproduct
development and testing them using a largersample and
more systematic research design than previouswork.
BACKGROUND
A classic distinctionin organizationalthinkingis between
situations that can be described as certain,predictable,
well-understood,or routineand situations that are
characterizedas unpredictable,intractable,or uncertain
(Burnsand Stalker,1961; Galbraith,1973; Scott, 1987). An
implicationof this distinctionis that when situations are
certainor predictable,then people can plan and organize
their activitiesto rely on routineand bureaucratic
organization(Galbraith,1973). When uncertaintyreigns, then
people adjustto this lack of informationby being more
experimental,flexible, and even improvisational(Scott,
1987).
This distinctionappears in numerous areas of organizational
inquiry.In organizationaldesign, authors describe how
conditionsof low uncertaintyare best adapted to
bureaucraticor mechanisticorganizations,while in conditions
of high uncertainty,more flexible, adaptive,organic
organizationsare appropriate(Burnsand Stalker,1961;
Lawrenceand Lorsch,1967; Galbraith,1973). The distinction
also appears in decision-makingtheories. Fredrickson(1984)
advised that when uncertaintyis low, rationalmodels of
goals and choice processes are appropriate,whereas less
comprehensive models become relevantin more uncertain,
turbulentsettings. Typologiesof efficient problem-solving
strategies for differingtechnologies (Thompson,1967;
Perrow, 1986) and organizationalcontrol(Ouchi,1980) also
reflect the distinctionbetween certainand uncertaintasks.
This same distinctionemerges in the nascent theorizing
about fast productdevelopment. One approach,drawing
from much of the existing productdevelopment literature
surveyed above (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Womack, Jones, and
Roos, 1990; Stalkand Hout, 1990; Millson,Raj,and
Wilemon, 1992), as well as disciplinessuch as civil
engineering, is based on what we term the compression
strategy. It assumes that productdevelopment is a
predictableseries of steps that can be compressed.
Accelerationinvolves planningthese steps (e.g., Guptaand
Wilemon, 1990; Womack,Jones, and Roos, 1990),
simplifyingthem throughsupplierinvolvement(e.g., Imai,
Nonaka,and Takeuchi,1985; Clarkand Fujimoto,1991),
shorteningthe time that it takes to complete each step in
the development process (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Stalkand
Hout, 1990; Cordero,1991), overlappingdevelopment steps
(Stalkand Hout, 1990; Clarkand Fujimoto,1991), and
rewardingdesigners for speed (e.g., Gold, 1987). Overall,
87/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 5----->this strategy involves rationalizingthe steps of the product
development process and then squeezing or compressing
them together.
An alternativeview is what we term the experiential
strategy. The basic ideas here are found in a varietyof fields,
includingimprovisation(Bastien and Hostager, 1988; Weick,
1993; Moormanand Miner,1994), chemistry and
biochemistry(Curtisand Barnes, 1989), neurobiology(Levy,
1994), cognitive psychology (Payne, Bettman, and Johnson,
1988), and strategic choice (Eisenhardt,1989; Eisenhardt
and Zbaracki,1992), as well as in some product
development literature(e.g., Quinn, 1985). The key
assumption here is that productdevelopment is a very
uncertainpath throughfoggy and shifting markets and
technologies. Thus accelerationin this scenario involves
rapidlybuildingintuitionand flexible options so as to
cope with an unclearand changingenvironment.Yet,
simultaneously,it also involves providingenough
structureso that people will create sensemaking, avoid
procrastination,and be confident enough to act in these
highlyuncertainsituations,which easily lead to paralyzing
anxiety and conflict.This approachis thus more a response
to uncertaintythan certainty,more iterativethan linear,and
more experienced-basedthan planned.
The thesis here is that both compression and experiential
strategies accelerate productdevelopment. Yet because
they have differentassumptions about the underlying
process (i.e., certaintyvs. uncertainty),they do so in
differentways. To the extent that productdevelopment
is a predictablepath throughwell-known markets and
technologies, then the compression strategy is relevant. If
the path is more uncertain,then an experientialstrategy is
relevant. In the next sections, we expand these strategies
througha series of hypotheses and examine them
empirically.
Hypotheses
Compression strategy. The underlyingassumption of the
compression strategy is that productdevelopment is a
predictableor certainprocess, one that can be plannedout
as a series of discrete steps. Such a process can then be
compressed by shorteningthe time of each step,
overlappingthe execution of successive steps, and
rewardingdevelopers for attainingthe compressed schedule.
The result is accelerated productdevelopment.
Froma compression perspective, more time spent in
planningis particularlyimportantfor squeezing product
development time. By emphasizingplanning,product
developers can better understandand rationalizethe
development process (Guptaand Wilemon, 1990). This, in
turn, allows them to eliminate unnecessary steps (Cordero,
1991) and sequence activities in efficient order.Without
such planning,developers are more likelyto do tasks that
are not needed or to do them incorrectly,resultingin wasted
resources throughsubstantialdelays and backtrackingas
these mistakes are fixed. Further,more time spent in
planningcan also help developers to delegate steps
88/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 6----->Adaptive Processes

appropriatelyto the best-qualifiedpeople, who, in turn, can
probablyexecute the task most quickly.Thus more time
spent in planningshould help shorten projecttime by
rationalizingthe process, reducingmistakes, and shortening
delays (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Guptaand Wilemon, 1990;
Cordero,1991; lansiti, 1992). Hayes, Wheelwright,and Clark
(1988) explicitlynoted the importanceof predevelopment
planningto fast productdevelopment.
More time spent in planningalso squeezes development
time because it can help to smooth interactionsamong
developers and gain resources, both of which can accelerate
pace. Planningprovidesa blueprintfor action that organizes
projectteam interaction.Such planningcan limit
misunderstandingsand reduce time-consumingcoordination
problems, as team members can refer to the plan for
common language and understanding.Womack, Jones, and
Roos (1990) observed that when lean automotive
manufacturersspent substantialeffort in planning,conflicts
were resolved and the projects moved ahead more quickly.
Lackof resources can also be a roadblockto fast product
development. Development teams that spend more time
planningmay have an edge in gaining resources because
planningcan enhance the appearanceof being competent
and well organized(Pfeffer, 1992). Thus extensive planning
can serve as an importantsignal of projectquality(Feldman
and March,1981). In formalterms:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): More time spent in planningis associated with
shorterdevelopment time.

A key assumption of the compression perspective is that
productdevelopment is a series of predictablesteps.
Because the development steps are clear in advance,
anotherway to shorten development time is to delegate the
execution of those steps to another organizationthrough
supplierinvolvement(Gold,1987; Imai,Nonaka,and
Takeuchi,1985; Clarkand Fujimoto,1991). Supplier
involvementin many stages of the process reduces the
workloadof the focal team, as Clarkand Fujimoto(1991)
found in their study of the automotive industry,because the
work of developing ideas and designs is shared with
suppliers. Further,supplierinvolvementallows the focal
developers to focus on the execution of tasks that take
advantage of their key competencies and skills. Product
development time is also shortened because suppliers can
exploit their own competencies as well. Thus, since those
with more expertise can execute tasks faster, supplier
involvementin more steps of the design process should
reduce productdevelopment time.
Supplierinvolvementis also fast for other reasons. If
suppliers are involvedin many steps of the process, then
they are more likelyto catch future problems, such as
contradictoryspecificationsor unrealisticdesigns, sooner in
the process, when they are easier to fix. Supplier
involvementalso improves thinkingabout the productdesign
by integratingsuppliers'ideas and alternativeperspectives
into the productin more stages of the process. In their
study of six productdevelopment projects among heavy
industrialmanufacturersin the U.S. midwest, Mabert,Muth,
89/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 7----->and Schmenner (1992) found that the supplierswere
involvedin many stages of fast projects. In formalterms:
Hypothesis 2 (H2): More supplierinvolvementis associated with
shorterdevelopment time.

Productdevelopment time can also be compressed by
shorteningthe time of individualsteps in the development
process (e.g., Rosenau, 1988; Stalkand Hout, 1990). While
approaches to trimmingstep time may varywith different
types of development processes, one importanttool is CAD
(Rosenau, 1988). As Cordero(1991) observed, CADspeeds
up computationtimes in the design process by allowing
developers to reach a finaldesign more quicklythroughthe
automationof predictablecomputationalprocedures. More
CADuse in the development process should shorten the
entire process by acceleratingthe computationsof individual
engineers.

More CADuse by developers also shortens predictable
processes throughthe reuse of past designs (Huber,1991).
Reusing past learningand expertise should dramatically
shorten actual design time and lead to fewer errors
downstream that need to be corrected. Such reuse should
significantlyreduce the riskof a product'snonfunctionalityat
a later date, when such errorsare much more difficultto fix.
Finally,more CADuse by developers can also smooth
interactionamong projectteam members. CADsystems
give developers an electronic communicationnet that can
expedite both communicationand coordinationamong
productdesigners.1 In formalterms:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): More designers using computer-aideddesign
(CAD)is associated with shorterdevelopment time.

Compressionof productdevelopment steps involves not
only shortening individualsteps, but also reducingthe wait
time between steps or even overlappingthose steps (Stalk
and Hout, 1990). Predictablesteps can be overlapped
because they are better known in advance, more tasks can
be accomplished in parallel,and the waiting time between
steps can be eliminatedby overlappingthese steps. Imai,
Nonaka,and Takeuchi(1985) found that problemsolving
could be overlappedby overlayingengineeringand
productionphases in the development of a successful (and
fast time-to-market)copier developed by Fuji-Xerox.
Likewise, Clarkand Fujimoto(1991) found that overlapping
steps, such as integratingdie design and die making,
significantlyreduced productcycle time. Drawingfrom their
experience, other authors (e.g., Gold, 1987; Cordero,1991)
have given similarimportanceto projectoverlap.Therefore:
Hypothesis 4 (H4): A higherdegree of projectoverlapis associated
with shorterdevelopment time.

Hargadon, a Ph.D. student at Stanford
University and former productdevelopment engineer.

Multifunctionalteams are closely linkedto successful project
overlap (e.g., Quinn, 1985; Stalkand Hout, 1990; Clarkand
Fujimoto,1991) because the differentstages rely on
differingblends of multifunctionalexpertise. Such teams
permitdevelopment steps to be integratedand link
technical, marketing,and manufacturingactivities. Such
teams also speed up the productdevelopment process
because downstream problems in the variousfunctional
areas are more likelyto be observed early in the process,
90/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 8----->Adaptive Processes

when they are easier to correct (e.g., Imai, Nonaka, and
Takeuchi, 1985; Gold, 1987). Further, involving more
functions early in the process reduces the wait time
between steps (Stalk and Hout, 1990). The time that it takes
to move between design and prototype manufacturing, for
example, is likely to be reduced when manufacturing people
are already present on the team (e.g., Gupta and Wilemon,
1990; Cordero, 1991; Mabert, Muth, and Schmenner, 1992).
In formal terms:
teams are associated with
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Multifunctional
shorterdevelopment time.
The above hypotheses involve compressing development
time through up-front planning, leveraging the expertise of
suppliers, using CAD to cut the execution time of individual
development steps, and overlapping product development
phases through the use of multifunctional teams. Our final
compression hypothesis addresses motivating developers to
shorten process time.
As suggested by agency, achievement, and learning theories
of motivation, as well as by some product development
writers (e.g., Gold, 1987; Gupta and Wilemon, 1990;
Cordero, 1991), rewards can have an important effect on
product development speed. This is particularlytrue when
the development process is predictable. In these situations,
an explicit development schedule can be created, and
rewards can be tied to meeting that schedule. Rewards
based on schedule attainment focus the attention of
developers on the particularproject at hand, rather than on
other projects, and on time-based performance, rather than
on other issues, such as the technological sophistication of
the product. This increases speed because it limits efforts
that are peripheral to the central task.
In addition, rewarding product developers for achieving clear
deadlines better synchronizes the energies and attention of
the team (Gersick, 1988). Clear goals also typically create
team alignment (e.g., Sherif et al., 1961) and so limit
time-consuming bickering about the ultimate agenda of the
group. For all of these reasons, rewarding the project team
for schedule attainment should focus and motivate
developers to shorten product development time. These
arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 6 (H6): Greaterrewardfor schedule attainmentis
associated with shorterdevelopment time.
Experiential strategy. In contrast to the compression
strategy, the experiential strategy suggests that moving
faster simply by accelerating an existing, albeit streamlined
process is unrealistic. The underlying assumption here is that
product development is a highly uncertain path through
foggy and shifting markets and technologies. The key to fast
product development is, then, rapidly building intuition and
flexible options in order to learn quickly about and shift with
uncertain environments. At the same time, it is also
important to create structure and motivate pace in these
settings, because the uncertainty can create paralyzing

anxiety about the future (George, 1980; Weick, 1993). Thus
fast pace entails both cognitive and emotional issues.
91/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 9----->From the experiential perspective, one way to speed up
product development is through frequent iteration. Just as
catalysts and heat accelerate chemical reactions by creating
more opportunities for reactions to occur (Curtis and Barnes,
1989), multiple design iterations (also termed "prototyping"
in some popular literature) accelerate product design by
simply offering more opportunities or chances for a "hit."
These design iterations can be simultaneous, alternative
designs, designs that are iterations of previous designs, or
some combination of the two. Regardless of the actual
iteration pattern, simply increasing the number of design
iterations improves the odds of success and thus
accelerates the process, particularlywhen predictable paths
do not exist.
Iterations also shorten development time for other,
more subtle reasons. They accelerate the building of
understanding about the product. By trying design variations,
developers can gain an intuitive feel for the sensitivity of the
parameters and the robustness of the designs. Similar to
situated learning (e.g., Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989;
Lave and Wenger, 1991), learning by doing through multiple
iterations is a quicker way to learn than less participative and
more cognitive strategies. Further, as several authors have
described (Payne, Bettman, and Johnson, 1988; Eisenhardt,
1989), judging the worth of an iteration is particularlydifficult
in unpredictable settings. Multiple iterations make such
judgments easier, since comparing alternatives makes
strengths and weaknesses much more apparent (Payne,
Bettman, and Johnson,1988; Eisenhardt, 1989).
Iterations also build more flexibility into understanding. Many
iterations improve cognitive ability to shift with new
information (Eisenhardt, 1989; Weick, 1993). Also, when
there are many iterations, designers are also less likely to
become attached to one particularvariation and so are better
able to adjust if changing conditions warrant it. Finally,
iterations shorten the process by improving the confidence
of development teams. Teams that have created multiple
iterations will be less likelyto procrastinate because they worry
that they may be missing better alternatives and so be more
able to settle on a design (Eisenhardt, 1989). In formal terms:
Hypothesis 7 (H7): More design iterationsare associated with
shorterdevelopment time.
Testing throughout the design process is closely related to
frequent iterations. Testing reveals problems that can then
be addressed in subsequent design iterations. Testing
speeds product development because developers are more
likely to discover errors earlier in the process, when they are
easier to correct (Gupta and Wilemon, 1990). Testing
throughout the development process gives frequent
evaluations of the current design. In contrast, without
extensive testing, developers may uncover their errors too
late. Testing is especially important in uncertain situations, in
which developers are more likely to discover, rather than
anticipate errors.
A related advantage is that extensive testing accelerates
understanding and reconceptualization of the product
through trial and error learning. By confronting real data
about actual results, such as some aspect of the design that
92/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 10----->Adaptive Processes

does not work or works differently than anticipated, the
product team is firmly forced out of faulty preconceptions
(Mabert, Muth, and Schmenner, 1992; von Hippel and Tyre,
1993). The result is a process in which developers are likely
to update and improve their thinking frequently throughout
the design process in response to concrete results.
While the above reasons emphasize the cognitive aspect of
the speed advantages of extensive testing, there are
emotional advantages as well. Testing also increases speed
because it builds developers' confidence. When product
teams test particulardesigns, the development process
becomes more concrete and believable. Like what happens
in the illusion of control (Langer, 1975), developers gain
confidence because they have proactively engaged in a
concrete action. This is especially relevant in unpredictable
situations, in which people often procrastinate in the face of
uncertainty (George, 1980). Testing throughout the
development process also increases speed because it
creates many failures from which designers can learn.
Moreover, because the testing is on-going, the size of any
particularfailure is likely to be small, since designers have
probably incorporated the learning from earlier failures. Such
small, frequent failures are very motivating and create
particularlyrapid learning because they capture people's
attention but yet are not so large as to raise denial or
blocking defenses (Sitkin, 1992).
Finally, testing increases development speed because
attending to the kind of factual and concrete information that
testing provides grounds discussions in concrete facts,
rather than in abstractions that can lead to endless conflict
and interpersonal animosity. Several studies outside of
product development illustrate this phenomenon. Murnighan
and Conlon (1991) found that string quartets that
concentrated on playing music, rather than on discussing
musical choices, got along better. Similarly, Eisenhardt and
Bourgeois (1995) found that slavish attention to factual
operating and environmental data was characteristic of top
management teams that could disagree, but could still get
along. In formal terms:
Hypothesis 8 (H8): More time spent in testing throughoutthe
development process is associated with shorterdevelopment time.
Frequent milestones (i.e., formal project review points) also
accelerate product development, but such milestones do not
imply comprehensive planning. Rather, they suggest
frequent reassessment of the current state of progress.
Frequent milestones shorten development time because
they force people to look often at what they are doing so
that if actions are off-course, they can be corrected earlier in
the process. Particularlyin uncertain situations, frequent
milestones are an effective way of checking current
progress against evolving markets and technologies (Gersick,
1994). Milestones also provide a sense of order and routine
that serves as a counterpoint to the more freewheeling and
even chaotic activities of iteration and testing (Bastien and
Hostager, 1988; Weick, 1993).

Frequentmilestones also shorten development time
because they are motivating.Theirfrequency creates a
93/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 11----->sense of urgencythat keeps developers from procrastinating
(e.g., Gersick, 1988). Achievingthe milestones can also give
people a sense of controland accomplishment that can be
very motivating(McClelland,1961; Langer,1975). In
addition,they also may promote coordinationand
communicationamong different parts of the development
team. In contrast,with widely spaced milestones, problems
are spotted later,when it is usuallyharderto readjust.
Projectprogress can stall or go off trackbecause of limited
or incorrectdirection,and misunderstandingscan arise
because of lack of communicationand coordinationof
activities among developers. The adaptive process can fail
because it becomes too unstructuredand chaotic (Waldrop,
1992). In formalterms:
Hypothesis 9 (H9): Less time between milestones is associated
with shorterdevelopment time.

Powerfulleaders also help to accelerate product
development by keeping the process focused. Such a highly
iterativeand experientialprocess can lose its focus if the
productteam loses sight of the "big picture."Conflictsand
confusion can emerge. Powerfulproject leaders are essential
to hold the productdevelopment process together. Such
leaders accelerate the speed of productdevelopment by
maintaininga discipliningvision that keeps the chaos of
experientialproductdevelopment under control (Brownand
Eisenhardt,1995a). Such a leader is also better able to
secure the resources that the team needs to execute the
design task. Clarkand his colleagues (Clark,Chew, and
Fujimoto,1987; Clarkand Fujimoto,1991) have provided
evidence for the importanceof a powerful leader to the pace
of a productdevelopment project.They used the term
"heavyweight"to describe projectleaders who reportto
high levels within the hierarchy,have high status within the
organization,and have direct responsibilityfor many aspects
of the project.They found that projects managed by
heavyweight managers had a nine-monthadvantage over
projects run by managers with little influence. These
arguments lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 10 (H10): Greaterpower of the projectleader is
associated with shorterdevelopment time.

METHODS
Sample
The research population is large (i.e., greater than $50 million
in sales) computer companies in the U.S., Europe, and Asia
that compete in the personal computer (PC), minicomputer,
mainframe, and peripherals segments of the industry. The
research team assembled company names from a variety of
sources, including Dataquest, International Data Corporation,
and COMPUSTAT,as well as electronics trade sources, such
as Electronics News and Electronics Times.
We chose to use data from the computer industry because
the quickly evolving scientific and competitive base and
modest capital intensity contribute to making this a
high-velocity industry in which rapid pace is critical
(Bourgeois and Eisenhardt, 1988). In addition, in contrast
with several important previous studies (Imai, Nonaka, and
Takeuchi, 1985; Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990; Clarkand
Fujimoto, 1991), we also wanted to focus on an industry that
was not dominated by Japanese competitors or by large,
mechanical designs. Large firms were chosen so that we
could study established development processes rather than
the more idiosyncratic and developing processes of young
and small firms.
The research team sent letters to the presidents or relevant
vice presidents of these companies, asking them to
participate in the study, and followed up with telephone
calls. Executives were assured of the confidentiality of their
data and that only aggregate data would be reported.
The unit of analysis is the product development project.
Within each company, we studied two product development
projects within a single product group. Research team
members and firm executives jointly chose these two
projects to ensure recent projects at similar levels of
complexity within industry segments. Most projects had
been completed within four to nine months of the study. A
few were as old as 12 months or as recent as two months.
We studied one medium-sized development project and one
major development project in each firm. A major project was
defined as one involving significant innovation, a new
product generation, and/or a major commitment of
resources. A medium-scale project was defined as a
representative or typical project resulting in a new product.
Research team members worked with firm executives to
ensure a consistent interpretation of medium and major
across firms, particularlywithin industry segments. Major
projects usually were those to develop a new hardware
platform. Medium projects usually involved the development
of a new product within an existing platform family and
computer architecture, such as a new model with higher
processor speed, more input/output slots, or other similar
functionality features. Executives preferred to select their
most recent projects so that the resulting information would
reflect their current practices.
Thirty-six computer companies participated in the study, with

each contributingtwo productsfrom a single strategic
business unit (SBU),for a total of 72 products.The response
95/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 13----->rate was approximately 70 percent. The high response rate
appears to be due to extensive corporate interest in the
benchmarking information from the study. Firms were to
obtain feedback at the end of the study comparing their
practices with those of others. Reasons for declining to
participate primarilyrevolved around the firms' personnel
being too busy. Reflecting the composition of the global
computer industry, 50 percent of the firms were from the
U.S., 30 percent from Asia, and 20 percent from Europe.
Most firms were begun since 1970, with the majority having
been launched since 1980. Reflecting the composition of the
industry, the sample of projects was approximately 48
percent personal computer, 19 percent peripherals, 14
percent mainframe, and 19 percent minicomputer projects.
While sampling bias is always a possibility when there are
nonrespondents, the potential for sampling bias was reduced
by high response rates, roughly equal response rates across
geographic regions, and the constrained variation of age and
firm size within the population.
Data Collection
Data were collected using a detailed instrument that
included top management, marketing, manufacturing, and
finance sections as well as the product development section
studied here. The total instrument was 107 pages long,
including a 29-page product development section. The
product development section consisted of closed-end items
that focused on primarilyobjective information about the
product development process (e.g., percentage of engineers
who used CAD). Such objective data are likely to be more
accurate and less subject to retrospective sensemaking and
common methods variance than more subjective data
(Wagner and Crampton, 1993). One of the authors was the
principal designer of the product development section. Both
authors have work experience in the computer industry and
academic training in computer-related fields. Several
academics who were knowledgeable about technologybased firms, a venture capitalist, and several management
consultants with significant experience in the industry also
participated in the design. The instrument was pilot-tested at
four sites, foreign and domestic. It was then revised in light
of the pilot-test results.
Data gathering proceeded in several steps. First, after
securing the cooperation of the firm, the research team sent
the data collection instrument to the location where the
products were developed. To enhance data accuracy, the
instrument included not only specific questions but also
detailed instructions, definitions of key terms, a document
giving an overview of the research, and the names of two
members of the research team whom company respondents
could contact with questions at any time. Many respondents
took advantage of these communication capabilities.
According to their knowledge of specific information
required, different people within the firm completed
particularsections of the instrument. The information for
each project was completed by two to four members of the
development project team, including the leader. These
respondents were directly involved with daily product
96/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 14----->Adaptive Processes

development. Such knowledgeable respondents helped to
ensure accurate data. While completing the instrument, firm
personnel called or faxed their research team contacts with
questions and requests for clarification, which also helped to
ensure accurate data.
After the instrument was completed, two research team
members (all with field research training, most with technical
backgrounds, and most completely blind to the hypotheses
of this study) thoroughly reviewed the completed instrument
for problems and completeness. They then met with the
respondents on-site, for an average of one to two days, to
verify the validity of the responses, help respondents
complete any incomplete items, gather qualitative and
observational data, and answer questions. These verification
sessions entailed group meetings among firm personnel
(including developers from both projects, project managers,
and their managers) involved in completing the instrument
and the two research team members. During these
sessions, the product development section was reviewed to
ensure accurate data. These verification sessions also served
to limit further the potential for social desirability bias by
involving a large number of knowledgeable individuals
beyond those specifically responsible for a given project.
Discrepancies were cleared up and archival data were
consulted to verify dates when the accuracy of the data
seemed questionable. Smaller meetings-were held as
appropriate. Any remaining or subsequent issues were
addressed by follow-up phone calls and faxes.
Japanese-speaking research team members worked with the
Asian firms, while Europeans handled European firms, and
U.S. members focused on U.S. firms. The instrument was
available in English, Japanese, and German. The instrument
used in non-Japanese (e.g., Taiwan and Korea) Asian firms
was in English.
The potential for social desirability bias was reduced by the
use of multiple informants in multiple settings and by the
interest among informants in accurate, benchmark data for
their projects in this highly competitive industry. In addition,
the measures of many constructs rest on relatively objective
data, which are less susceptible to social desirability biasing
than subjective data. The study was also embedded in a
larger study of excellence among electronics firms, so firm
respondents were unaware of our specific interest in fast
product development.
Common methods variance is also a concern. The potential
for bias was reduced by having the instrument completed
successively in different ways and at different times, initially
by two to four members of the product development team
and later, during the verification session, by the research
team members and a larger group of firm personnel. In
addition, the many types of measures, including percentages,
elapsed times, types of people involved, and Likert-scale
items, also limits the potential for common methods
problems. Finally, as Wagner and Crampton (1993) observed

in their review of numerous studies, the problemof
common methods varianceis often overstated.
97/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 15----->Measures
It was critical to measure time well, as accurate
measurement of time is particularlyimportant for many
concepts in this study. The start of a project was marked by
the time at which the first meeting was held to consider the
development of this specific product. Frequently, it also
marked the first assignment of firm personnel to assess the
feasibility of the product. The ending date was the date at
which product stabilization was reached. Stabilization is a
well-known industry term describing the time at which no
more changes are made to the product. These dates were
obtained from the group response of multiple informants, as
described above, and were verified, as appropriate, with
archival documents. This information was maintained by a
product development process group in many firms.
Measuring several constructs also required dividing the
product development process into phases. These phases
were developed with several experienced management
consultants, a senior engineering executive with twenty
years of experience in the computer industry, and a venture
capitalist. They were then pilot-tested at four sites. The
corporate informants had little difficulty understanding and
using these categories, as the phrasing and phases are
common within the industry. We determined the start and
end dates, the length of these phases, and their overlap with
other phases from the combined response of multiple
informants.
The phases are as follows: Predevelopment or the planning
phase begins at the project start and ends with completion
of the basic product requirements. The conceptual design
begins with the completed basic product requirements and
ends with final specification of the product. Product design
includes the actual engineering work to take the
specifications to a fully designed product and ends with final
release to system test. Testing begins with component and
system test and ends with release of the product to
production. Process development begins with the first
process design and ends at the completion of the first pilot
run. Production start-up includes increases in production
volume and ends at the stabilization of production. The
following are descriptions of the measures for each of the
hypothesized constructs.
Planning corresponds to the percentage of time that was
spent on the predevelopment phase (i.e., from the start of
the project to the development of basic product
requirements), as designated by the respondent
management group. This percentage was computed by
dividing the total reported time spent on planning the
product by the total elapsed time, from the start date to the
end date, of the development project.
Supplier involvement in stages of the development process
was measured by whether suppliers were involved in each
of the stages of the product development process, as
described above, and was calculated as the number of
stages in which suppliers actually participated. Involvement

was defined as havingone or more employees of a supplier
98/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 16----->Adaptive Processes

as recognized members of the product development team,
actively participating in team meetings and design activities.
CAD usage was measured by the percentage of design
engineers on the product development team (electronic,
mechanical, and manufacturing process) who used
computer-aided design systems when designing on the
project. We also used a second, less direct measure, the
rating by respondents of the importance of increasing CAD
usage to decreasing product development time, on a 5-point
Likert scale (1 = not at all important and 5 = very
important). The correlation between the two measures is
.50.
Project overlap was measured by the sum of the overlaps (in
months) across the six phases described above of the
product development project, divided by the total
development time. Higher percentages of overlap reflected
more project overlap.
Multifunctional team was measured by whether personnel
from specific functions were involved on the product
development team during the various stages of product
development. The functions were purchasing,
manufacturing, marketing/sales, engineering, service, and
finance/cost accounting. For each phase of the project, we
calculated the total number of functions. The final
multifunctional team measure is calculated by adding the
total number of functions in every phase. As in the case of
supplier involvement, involvement is defined as having one
or more members of the function as recognized members of
the product development team, including active participation
in team meetings and design activities.
Reward for schedule attainment was measured by a 5-point
Likert scale asking whether the product development
personnel were rewarded for meeting the schedule
deadlines during the course of the project (1 = never,
5 = always).
Number of design iterations was measured directly by
asking how many iterations occurred in the development of
the product. An iteration was defined as a redesign of at
least 10 percent of a product's parts. Since the scale of this
response might vary by industry segment (e.g., mainframes
and personal computers may have different numbers of
iterations because of differences in the nature of the
product), this measure was adjusted by the average number
of iterations for each industry segment. We divided the
difference between the number of design iterations for a
project and the average number of iterations of its
corresponding industry segment by the average number of
iterations in the industry segment. The industry segments of
personal computers, peripherals, mainframes, and
minicomputers that we used as our research population
correspond to major product categories within the industry.
Test corresponds to the percentage of time that is spent on
testing the designs. Like the planning measure above, this
percentage was measured by dividing the total reported time

spent on testing the product(fromstart to end date) by the
99/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 17----->total elapsed time, from the start date to the end date, of
the development project.
Time between milestones was measured by first asking the
respondent group to provide the number of formal
milestones for the project, with a milestone defined as an
officially scheduled project review point. The respondents
were then asked the average time (weeks) between these
milestones during the project. Since the scale of this
response can vary by industry segment (e.g., the time scale
may differ for personal computers and mainframes), this
measure was adjusted in the same way as the number of
design iterations.
Power of the project leader was measured by asking the
respondent group where in the SBU hierarchy the project
manager reported. We coded this 1 if he or she reported
directly to the SBU manager (the highest reporting
relationship), and 0 if the reporting relationship were with
someone lower in the SBU hierarchy. As a second measure,
we also assessed power by whether or not the project
manager was the final decision maker on the key issues of
budget, team composition, and the project timetable. The
interitem correlations for these measures ranged between
.33 and .50, with a Cronbach alpha of approximately .67.
Dependent and Control Variables
Development time for each development project
corresponds to its duration relative to the average
development time of all projects in its industry segment. The
duration of each project was measured by the start and end
dates of the project, as defined earlier. The average
development time of all projects in each industry segment is
the mean of all the reported industry segment project
durations. The relative development time was calculated by
dividing the difference between each project's duration and
the average project duration of its corresponding industry
segment by the average project duration of its industry
segment. We adjusted the development time of each project
by the average development time of its segment, since the
projects in the personal computer segment, for example,
may take considerably less time than projects in the
mainframe segment and may be subject to different
competitive forces pushing for completion.
Project size. As noted earlier, two projects came from each
strategic business unit. One was a medium-size project
while the other was a major project. Since it seems likely
that major projects would take longer to complete than
medium-scale ones, we controlled for these differences
using a dummy variable. Zero indicates a medium-scale
project, and one corresponds to a major project.

results of the ordinary least squares regression analyses.

regional differences (Asia, U.S., and Europe) and resource
funding and found no significant effects. These results are
available from the authors.
The second regression model adds the variables from the
compression strategy to the analysis. While the overall
regression is statistically significant, the results for several of
the hypotheses are in the opposite direction from what we
hypothesized. Planning led to slower, not faster product
development, contrary to hypothesis 1. Similarly, we had
hypothesized that greater supplier involvement would
decrease the development time (H2). In contrast, the results
indicate that greater supplier involvement slowed the pace
of product development. Also contrary to our hypotheses,
CAD usage, as measured by the percentage of designers
using CAD (H3), slowed product development. In results
available from the authors, we also found that CAD usage as

<-----Page 19----->measured by our less direct measure (i.e., perceived
importance of CAD usage to shorter product development
time) also slowed product development. Among these
variables, only the use of cross-functional teams (H5) led to
faster product development. Reward for schedule (H6) and
overlap (H4) were not significant. Thus, three of the six
elements of the compression strategy significantly
lengthened product development time, rather than
reducing it.
The third model displays the regression results for the
experiential model. The overall model is significant and,
unlike the compression model, the hypotheses are
supported. Hypothesis 7 stated that a higher number of
design iterations is associated with faster development time.
Hypothesis 8 stated that longer product testing is associated
with faster development time. As indicated by the third
model in Table 3, these hypotheses are significantly
supported.2 Time between milestones (H9) also was
significant. Finally, project leader power (H10), as measured
by whether the project manager reported to the SBU
manager, is also related to fast product development,
although other measures of power are not significant. Thus
the experiential strategy significantly shortened product
development times.
The fourth model displays the full regression results for the
combination of the compression, experiential, and control
variables. The full model is significant and, as in the previous
regressions, multifunctional teams (H5), iterations (H7), test
(H8), and milestones (H9) are supported while, contrary to
our hypotheses, planning (H1) and CAD (H3) significantly
lengthened product development time. Supplier involvement
(H2) and project leader power (H10) are no longer significant.
The fifth model is a final, parsimonious model that includes
the most significant variables (p < .10) from the full model,
model 4. The entire model is significant. As indicated, all
variables from the experiential model in the regression are
significant as well: Faster product development is associated
with more testing (H8), more frequent milestones (H9), and
more iterations (H7). Project leader power (H10) was
dropped at the previous stage. In contrast, the compression
results are less significant and sometimes opposite to those
that were hypothesized: Planning (H1) and CAD usage (H3)
were associated with slower product development. Supplier
involvement (H2), project overlap (H4), and reward for
schedule attainment (H6) were dropped at the previous
stage because of lack of significance. Only multifunctional
teams (H5) are positively associated with fast product
development.
Split-sample Analyses
2

In results availablefromthe authors,we
foundthat curvilinearmodels of iterations
and test were not significant.
3

We appreciateLauraKopczak'svery
helpfulsuggestion to perform
split-sampleanalyses.

We explored the surprising results for the compression
model further with split-sample analyses.3 We reasoned that
perhaps the compression results would be more consistent
with our hypotheses if we examined only mainframe and
minicomputer projects, the 24 projects best fitting the
predictability assumption of this strategy. Since these
products have extensive proprietary hardware and software,
their designs are more predictable from project to project
102/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 20----->Adaptive Processes

and more insulated from changing technologies. Also, their
markets are stable and mature (Business Week, 1994).
As indicated in the first model of Table 4, the overall
compression model is statistically significant for these more
certain projects. In addition, supplier involvement (H2) and
use of CAD (H3) switch signs from the full-sample analyses
and are now related to fast product development in the
predicted direction. Overlap (H4) becomes significant. As
before, multifunctional teams (H5) are associated with fast
product development. Finally, only planning (H1-)significantly
slows the pace of product development. The signs of four
compression variables are in the predicted direction, while
only two are for the full sample (Table 2, model 2). The
adjusted R-square for the entire sample is higher, but since
many results are in the reverse direction for the full sample,
the compression model is a better fit with the mainframe
and minicomputer sample.
In model 2, we checked the results of the compression
model for less certain products, such as personal computers
and peripherals. These segments are characterized by high
growth rates and high technological and competitive
turbulence (Business Week, 1994). The results are similar to
those of the full model, indicating weak support for the
compression model. So, although the split-sample is not an
ideal analysis, it does appear that, while the full sample is
better described by the experiential model, the compression
model and in particular,the CAD, overlap, and supplier
involvement hypotheses are a better fit with the data when
the predictability assumption is more closely met.
Table 5 shows the results of the split-sample analyses to
examine the experiential model. As expected, the
experiential model captures the pace of less certain projects
(i.e., personal computers and peripherals) better than either
the pace of the full sample or the more predictable
mainframe and minicomputer projects. The number of
significant coefficients in the predicted direction and the

DISCUSSION
This paper is the first, we think, to examine theoretical
models of fast-paced, organizational processes. We
developed two theoretical approaches from literature on the
classic organizational distinction between certainty and
uncertainty and tested them in a field study of 72 product
development projects among large firms in the global
computer industry. Several of the results are worth
highlighting.
First, our results support the link between fast product
development and multifunctional teams and the experiential
strategy of iterations, testing, milestones, and powerful
leaders. We argued that iterations and testing would rapidly
build understanding and create multiple options. Frequent
milestones and powerful leaders, we argued, would
motivate and focus product development teams, while
multifunctional teams would create a wider range of ideas.
Overall, these results suggest that, in this setting, product
development is well characterized as a process of navigating
through unclear and shifting markets and technologies using
experiential and improvisational tactics. Fast product
development emerges as more uncertain than predictable,
more experiential than planned, and more iterative than
linear.
These findings relate to the existing product development
literature in several ways. The results for multiple iterations,
extensive testing, and frequent milestones extend current
thinking. They suggest a more real-time, hands-on approach
to fast product development, especially for uncertain
products, than the compression approach that is described in
much of the previous writing. The findings for the
importance of powerful project team leaders and

multifunctionalteams strengthen the thinkingand empirical

results of many authors (e.g., Quinn, 1985; Gold, 1987;
Gupta and Wilemon, 1990; Clarkand Fujimoto, 1991) by
replicating them with a more systematic research design and
with field data from an industry that is less Japanesedominated and less characterized by large, mechanical
products.
Second, the results for CAD, supplier involvement, and
overlap are mixed. Like others (e.g., Gold, 1987; Clark,
Chew, and Fujimoto, 1987; Gupta and Wilemon, 1990), we
argued that supplier involvement would simplify the process,
CAD would shorten process step times, and overlapping
would shorten the process. Yet for the full sample, these
variables are negatively or nonsignificantly associated with
fast product development. Why?
For CAD, one reason may be inappropriate implementation.
In talking informally with product developers and executives
after data collection, we learned that many CAD systems
take a long time to learn to use effectively. Further, some
firms end up with incompatible CAD systems that create
new delays. Also, some designers become so involved with
CAD that they get caught up in computer "hacking" and
lose focus on product development. One engineer best
summed up the above arguments: "to foul-up takes a
human, to really foul-up takes a computer." Finally, we also
learned in our informal conversations that current CAD
software is often directed at automating well-known
calculations and facilitating reuse of old designs. While these
applications may speed predictable product design, they are
poorly suited to creating new iterations and comprehensive
testing. Yet the results of this study indicate that these latter
applications would be very useful for speeding product
development. Only in predictable projects that have
well-known computational demands did CAD work well in
this study.
For supplier involvement, one reason for the mixed results
may be that, for less predictable projects, early involvement
may be difficult to achieve because there is less certainty
about which suppliers will be used. Fast developers
therefore may eschew early supplier involvement in favor of
last-minute supplier selection or buying off-the-shelf
components in order to maintain design flexibility much later
into the development process. In contrast, for predictable
projects, suppliers are likely to be clear early on, and, as we
argued in developing this hypothesis, it is possible and even
preferable to involve them early in the process.
The mixed results for CAD, overlap, and supplier
involvement also relate to the previous product development
literature. These variables have been associated with fast
product development by many authors (e.g., Imai, Nonaka,
and Takeuchi, 1985; Rosenau, 1988; Cordero, 1991; Clark
and Fujimoto, 1991; Mabert, Muth, and Schmenner, 1992).
What the results here suggest is that these past results
(which form the heart of the compression strategy) may hold
for predictable, mature products such as automobiles
(Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990; Clarkand Fujimoto, 1991)

and heavy industrialequipment (e.g., Mabert,Muth, and
Schmenner, 1992). In contrast, they are less significantand
105/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 23----->even negative predictors of development speed for products
such as personal computers, for which technology and
markets are rapidly and unpredictably evolving. This
suggests a contingent view of fast product development in
which the compression strategy is relevant for predictable
projects, while the experiential strategy is more germane to
unpredictable projects. In projects with a mix of predictable
and unpredictable aspects, a combination of strategies is
likely to be relevant.
Third, contrary to our and others' arguments, planning and
rewards for schedule are associated with slow product
development (e.g., Gold, 1987; Womack, Jones, and Roos,
1990; Gupta and Wilemon, 1990). Possibly, these concepts
were poorly measured. Certainly, our single Likert-scale item
for reward for schedule is not a strong measure. But other
explanations come to mind. One is reverse causality. Slow
firms may use reward for schedule as a solution to their
pace problems, not vice versa. Another possible reason is
that the schedule may actually slow down developers who
could move more quickly. Designers, who are rewarded for
schedule, may also neglect other outcomes such as quality
and adherence to specifications. This could lead to
inappropriate trade-offs regarding product quality and
subsequent delays or surprises downstream, which
ultimately retard the process. In contrast, fast developers in
this study appear to be motivated by frequent milestones,
which create a sense of urgency (Gersick, 1988) and
achievement (McClelland, 1961), and by extensive testing,
which creates intense task involvement (Sitkin, 1992).
For planning, one explanation is that extensive planning
simply wastes time, especially in high-velocity industries
such as computers. This explanation is consistent with
earlier work in the industry that describes how fast strategic
decision makers avoid planning because it is a futile exercise
when the environment is changing rapidly and unpredictably
(Eisenhardt,1989). Thus, perhaps planning slows down the
pace of the process when information is incomplete or
obsolete. Consistent with situated learning (Lave and
Wenger, 1991), it may be faster to probe, test, iterate, and
experience than to plan.
Beyond Product Innovation
Finally, our results relate to the broader organizational and
strategic literatures. At the outset, we noted that adaptation
research has shifted from whether adaptation happens to
how and when it occurs (Gersick, 1994). Punctuated
equilibrium, which characterizes adaptation in terms of large,
infrequent structural changes has emerged as a dominant
model of adaptation (Miller and Freisen, 1984; Gersick,
1994; Romanelli and Tushman, 1994). Yet adaptation can
also occur through small, frequent shifts in how firms
compete in the marketplace. For example, Miller and Chen
(1994) focused on pricing, advertising, and scheduling moves
in the airline industry. Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996)
examined charter or domain changes among the strategic
business units within a major electronics firm. Here, we
describe product development processes that may provide
the same type of rapid, marketplace adaptation within the
106/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 24----->Adaptive Processes

computer industry. The image is adaptation to evolving
markets and technologies through a consistent, rapid flow of
new products that reposition and ultimately reshape firms.
As an example, Hewlett-Packard evolved from an
instruments company to a computer-based one through
successive new products, while Intel evolved from a
memory to a microprocessor firm through product innovation
(Burgelman, 1991). This view contrasts with adaptation as
wrenching, infrequent change that punctuates long periods
of inertia. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the
organizational processes or, in strategy parlance, the core
capabilities that create this type of rapid adaptation.
Our work also relates to the speed of organizational
processes. There is surprisingly little understanding in the
organizational literature of how and why processes are fast.
At best, there are some traditional assumptions that speed
might be achieved by skimping on analysis and information,
slashing conflict, or being centralized (e.g., Vroom and
Yetton, 1973; Mintzberg, Raisinghani, and Theoret, 1976;
Fredrickson, 1984). Yet each of these tactics also impairs the
quality and effectiveness of organizations and fails to deal
with how people overcome the emotional blocks to speed,
such as anxiety and procrastination. Cutting analysis and
information is likely to impair quality and to sap the
confidence of managers. Eliminating conflict is problematic
because conflict is often linked to high-quality processes. It
is also difficult to suppress. Centralization is problematic,
especially in dynamic environments, because such dictatorial
action often creates isolation and rigidity (Staw, Sandelands,
and Dutton, 1981). So, overall, these views are likely to be
too simplistic.
In contrast, the results here provide three new insights
about the speed of organizational processes. One is that
there is no single way to be fast. Rather, there are multiple
approaches for gaining speed in organizational processes.
Second, these approaches are distinct from those in the
traditional organizational literature, such as cutting
information, suppressing conflict, or relying on centralization.
The compression tactics rely on efficiently organizing the
process and then taking advantage of possibilities for
overlap, technological advances such as CAD, and the
expertise of others, such as suppliers. The experiential
approach rests on accelerated learning through iteration and
testing that is combined with the motivation and focus of
leadership and frequent milestones. Here real-time
interaction, flexibility, and improvisation are essential. Third,
the efficacy of these approaches appears to be contingent
on the task. Compression tactics build on a rational,
engineering perspective from the product development
literature and seem to fit best in more certain settings. In
this study, they best described mainframe and minicomputer
projects. In contrast, experiential tactics build on ideas about
intuition and improvisation that have emerged from
inductive, case research on jazz (Bastien and Hostager,
1988), strategic choice (Eisenhardt, 1989), and survival
(Weick, 1993). Their domain seems to be uncertain settings.

In this study, they best described productinnovationin the
computer industry,particularly
the volatileperipheraland
107/ASQ, March 1995

<-----Page 25----->personal computer segments. Taken together, these insights
begin to outline a more valid and complex view of fast
organizational processes.
Perhaps most importantly, from an organization theory
perspective, we call into question the traditional link
between organic processes and uncertain situations (Burns
and Stalker, 1961; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967; March,
1988). Burns and Stalker (1961) characterized organic
processes as lacking structure. Typical is their report of an
informant's claiming, "Of course, nobody knows his job
here" (p. 93). But playful, fluid organic processes fail to
capture the importance of focus and structure that emerges
here. Fast processes in uncertain situations may not be
organic, but they are improvisational in that they combine
real-time learning through design iterations and testing with
the focus and discipline of milestones and powerful leaders.
Thus our work joins a small but growing number of studies
that challenge the relevance of organic processes to
effective organization (Jelinek and Schoonhoven, 1990;
Weick, 1993; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995b) and relate
closely to emergent ideas on balancing order and disorder
within complex, adaptive systems (Kauffman, 1992;
Waldrop,1992).
CONCLUSION
Many organizational theories have their roots in the 1970s, a
time when the concerns for speed and flexibility that
dominate contemporary firms were not an issue (see also
Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1994). Not surprisingly, theories
such as transaction cost economics, agency, and resource
dependence are static or nearly so. Institutional theory has
little to say about pace and change. Even organization
ecology, which is dynamic at the population level, is largely
static at the firm level. While these theories may be useful
in equilibrium, they are not so appropriate for capturing
organizational forms in abruptly changing, competitive
settings. Yet ironically, many firms exist in industries in
which moving quickly is a key core capability and fast
product innovation is central to maintaining that pace.
In this paper we probed fast product innovation and, in so
doing, attempted to contribute not only to the product
innovation literature but also to the beginning of an outline of
fast, adaptive organizational processes and, ultimately,
organizational forms that fit with competitive, fast-paced
situations. A more dynamic organizational paradigm that
captures key features of continuously adaptive,
contemporary firms is beginning to emerge.
