Investment Practices and Outcomes
of Informal Venture Investors

(Accepted 17 August 2005)

ABSTRACT This study explores a model of venture investing developed from the literature on
formal venture capital research in the setting of angel investing in the USA. The model explores
the role of venture stage, due diligence, deal ﬂow, co-investing and post investment participation
on the distribution of returns to angel investors. Doing so directly addresses an interesting
question regarding the extent to which formal venture capital practices are appropriate and
eﬀective in the typical angel investment setting. In the process, results from the ﬁrst relatively
large-scale study of angel investor outcomes in the USA are reported and related to earlier
ﬁndings for UK angel investors.
KEY WORDS: Angel investing, informal venture capital, venture investing returns, entrepreneurial ﬁnance

Introduction
A few years ago, Mason and Harrison (2002) reported investment outcomes for
business angel investors in the UK, one of the very few investigations of performance
data for these informal venture capitalists. In answer to the question of ‘is it worth
it?’, they raised several concerns about the risk proﬁle of angel investors, where
investment failures are the rule rather than the exception. However, their results
relative to formal venture capital outcomes (Murray, 1999) showed signiﬁcantly
lower proportions of investment failure and comparable ‘homerun’ outcomes. It may
well be worth it, but signiﬁcantly more information is still needed.
The present study furthers eﬀorts to understand informal venture investing in two
ways. First, the eﬀects of using practices that are common in the formal venture
capital industry in an angel investing setting are explored. Exploring these practices
allows direct consideration of the ﬁt of formal venture capital as a model or guide
for angel investors. Second, this study reports results from the ﬁrst large scale study
of angel investor outcomes in the USA. Comparison of this new information to
Mason and Harrison (2002) further triangulates knowledge around this relatively
unspeciﬁed area of venture investing. Together these address the research questions

at hand: ﬁrst, how do important factors in formal venture capital investing relate to
angel investor performance? Second, how do the outcomes of angel investors in the
US compare to earlier outcome data from informal venture investors in Europe?
Angel investing occurs at the intersection of two interesting areas of study: equity
investing and entrepreneurship. While it is a mix of both ﬁelds, the current state of
the art primarily represents the investing perspective, drawing almost exclusively
upon theoretical research into formal venture capital (Prowse, 1998). The bulk of
formal venture capital research, in turn, is informed by principles from large market
practices in capital markets and corporate ﬁnance. Primary theoretical frames such
as information asymmetry, agency theory, and portfolio concepts are used to explain
aspects of formal venture capital practice and the structure of the venture capital
industry itself (Sapienza and Gupta 1994; Lerner, 1995; Hellman and Puri, 2002).
However, in very early stage ventures, where the majority of angel investing takes
place, these principles may or may not be driving factors. Anticipating agency risks
or overcoming contractual hazards due to opportunism, for example, may not be the
primary challenge (Arthurs and Busenitz, 2003; Kelly and Hay, 2003).
Understanding these issues is very important as angel investors play a leading role
in ﬁnancing entrepreneurs beyond their own resources. Current estimates suggest
that the angel investing market is actually larger than formal venture capital
investing (Sohl, 2005). Furthermore, given their focus in seed stage investments, this
translated to approximately $6 billion in angel capital going to seed stage ventures
compared to only $330 million from formal venture capitalists in 2004 (MoneyTree
Survey, 2004; Wiltbank, 2005). Many entrepreneurs and their high potential ventures
are impacted by angel investors at very early points in their development.
With these ideas in mind, the paper proceeds as follows: (i) identifying key factors
from formal venture capital that may also be important for angel investing; (ii)
evaluating these ideas with the results of a national study of US angel investors; and
(iii) looking speciﬁcally at these results in combination with those reported by Mason
and Harrison (2002) for the UK.
Formal Venture Capital Factors in Angel Investing
Formal venture capitalists make private equity investments into new ventures just as
angel investors do, and as a result make a natural comparison group and even role
model for angel investing. The visibility of venture capitalist and formal reporting
requirements given their legal structure have also made gathering data from venture
capitalists much more straightforward than from angel investors who tend to be
signiﬁcantly more private and have no reporting requirements other than private tax
returns. Formal venture capital research has primarily focused on two questions.
First, do formal venture capitalists have a systematic impact on the performance of
the ventures in which they invest? Second, do formal venture capitalists approach
equity investing in ways consistent with existing ﬁnancial theory? Focusing on this
second question, three key theoretical perspectives are central: agency theory,
information asymmetry and opportunism. Results from this research outline
how ‘best practices’ in venture investing address these key theoretical risk factors
(Figure 1). This set of practices provides the backbone for the following set of
hypotheses regarding their potential outcome eﬀects in angel investing.

VC Practice number 1: Investment Stage Focus
Successful new ventures are often conceived as following typical life cycles that
roughly proceed from inception of the venture idea, to a seed stage, then a start up
phase, a growth stage and ﬁnally into some form of exit such as an IPO or
acquisition by an established ﬁrm. Many venture capital funds mirror this process by
specializing in particular stages of funding such as start-up funds, mezzanine funds
and so on (Gupta and Sapienza, 1992; Ruhnka et al., 1992; Jain and Kini, 2000).
Venture capital ﬁrms generally avoid investing too early—that is, during seed and
start up stages—when ventures are barely stable, markets are unknown and the lack
of track record makes prediction of success more diﬃcult (Gupta and Sapienza,
1992). At the same time, they avoid investing too late, when equity prices are likely
more in line with overall market expectations as the uncertainty surrounding the
venture and its opportunity declines.
By not investing in the earliest stages of a new venture, venture capitalists avoid
moral hazards associated with injecting the single largest piece of investment in the
venture. Furthermore, this also signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of time they need to
invest in monitoring the venture (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994; Giﬀord, 1997). Investing
outside the seed stage also helps reduce adverse selection issues, the idea that the best
entrepreneurs self-select out of the venture capital market, as the ability to assess the
deal and track record of performance improves in later stages (Triantis, 2001).
H1: Investors that make fewer investments in seed stage ventures will experience
fewer failures.
VC Practice Number 2: Due Diligence
In addition to emphasizing particular stages of venture development, venture
capitalists also exert considerable eﬀort in carrying out due diligence. Executed over

several months, due diligence includes investigations into virtually every assumption
on which a business is founded (Fried and Hisrich, 1994). It covers background
checks of the founders, competitive assessment of market players, market research
into the size, composition and potential growth of the ﬁrm’s target market,
investigations into the ﬁnancial representations of the company’s position, and so on
(Dileep et al., 1992; Jensen, 2002).
Construction of various ﬁnancial models predicated upon the estimated structure
and size of future markets, as well as eﬀorts to predict the future valuation of the
investee ﬁrms are cornerstones of this eﬀort. For example, Macmillan and
Narasimha (1987) show that forecasted ﬁnancial ratios and their comparison to
peer group ﬁrms constitute a major aspect of VC due diligence and play an
important role in VC investment decisions. With regard to the theories discussed
earlier, once again, moral hazard and adverse selection problems are mitigated
through extensive investigations of the founders’ histories and detailed evaluation of
the quality of the deal under consideration.
H2: Investors that spend more time on due diligence will experience more successes
and fewer failures.
VC Practice Number 3: Deal Flow Initiatives
Deal ﬂow—the generation of a continuous stream of high quality investment
opportunities—is a critical concern for venture investors (Amis and Stevenson, 2001)
and the sources of these deals often diﬀers across individual investors (Kelly and Hay,
2000). Correspondingly, venture capitalists undertake initiatives for establishing a
broad network of relationships that can refer interesting new deals and entrepreneurs
to them. The networks include professionals that work with entrepreneurs,
organizations of entrepreneurs, trade associations, etc. (Benjamin and Marguilis,
2000). Deal ﬂow eﬀorts constitute an important method for addressing adverse
selection problems through extensive search and diversiﬁcation. One major source of
deal ﬂow through which portfolio breadth is accomplished is the practice of
syndication, where investors seek and are sought out by other investors to contribute
capital into various rounds of investment across ﬁrms outside their core portfolio
(Bygrave and Timmons, 1992; Jain, 2001). Where these initiatives are not present and
active, investors are unlikely to have the opportunity to invest in the best set of deals
possible. While it is challenging to evaluate the quality of deal ﬂow, the breadth of an
investor’s sources of deals plays a central role. As a result, where investments are
made through a more narrow and personal network, they are likely to under perform.
H3: Investors that make more investments in ventures found through friends will
experience fewer successes and more failures.
VC Practice Number 4: Co-Investment
When more than one VC is involved in a new deal, these co-investment relationships
provide an important ‘second set of eyeballs’ to the lead investor. Venture capitalists
that agree to lead a particular set of investors in a particular deal may seek to be led

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 15:54 22 April 2008

347

by others in other deals. The diﬀerential standing and mix-and-match of relationships between venture capital ﬁrms in these deals provide important co-operative
and reciprocal checks to overcome the non-excludability issue in private equity
markets (Lerner, 1994; Jain 2001). The necessity to repeatedly participate in each
other’s deals reduces the incentive for competitors of venture capital ﬁrms investing
in due diligence to steal away good quality deals, leaving them ‘holding the bag’ as it
were. For example, Steir and Greenwood (1995) show that prior interactions with
entrepreneurs and investors increase their likelihood of co-operation. Additionally,
involving co-investors requires that more than one set of investors ﬁnd the
opportunity compelling, helping reduce adverse selection problems.
H4: Investors who make more investments with other investors will experience
more successes and fewer failures.
VC Practice Number 5: Participation
In addition, venture capitalists add value to their ventures as they participate in them post
investment. This generally occurs in two primary activities, monitoring venture
performance, and improving the top management team. This monitoring role often
involves overseeing operations and ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrm, and aiding the
founders in deﬁning new markets and strategies (Gompers and Lerner, 2001).
Additionally, venture capitalists are instrumental in initiating changes in the top
management of the new venture (Boeker and Wiltbank, 2005). Jain (2001) reports that
venture capitalists’ involvement on new venture boards facilitates signiﬁcant performance
improvements after a venture goes public. While there is an argument that participation
is highest only when the venture is in trouble, thus causing the empirical relationship of
participation and outcomes to appear negative, the bulk of evidence and theory supports
a value-added contribution for participation. This seems to particularly be the case for
angel investors who emphasize participation a priori in their investing as opposed to
simply responding to problem ventures (Erlich et al., 1994; Van Osnabrugge, 1998).
Through this participation, investors can deal directly with agency issues, help avoid any
exposure to information asymmetry and opportunism concerns, and potentially
contribute expertise that contributes to the success of the venture.
H5: Investors that participate more in their ventures post-investment will
experience more successes and fewer failures.
Each of these practices helps reduce traditional risk factors: agency concerns,
information asymmetry, and opportunism. According to Lerner (1995, 1998) and
Fenn et al. (1997, 1998), venture capitalists incur considerable costs in search and
selection and then underwrite signiﬁcant eﬀorts in developing and administering
mechanisms that overcome potential agency problems and monitor performance of
each investment in the portfolio. In addition to these practices, experience factors of
the angel investors are likely to impact their investment outcomes.
Experience. Research on the value of expertise, reﬁning domain speciﬁc experience
over time, shows a very signiﬁcant relationship to improved performance in a broad

R. Wiltbank

range of settings (Ericsson and Lehmann, 1996). Experience as an investor is likely to
facilitate their deal ﬂow, their ability to do insightful due diligence, and smooth
various transactional details. Additionally, investors who are able to continue
investing over time require to have been reasonably successful in order to be able to
raise new investment funds. In addition to investor experience, many angels have
signiﬁcant entrepreneurial experience (Van Osnabrugge, 1998). Success as an
entrepreneur is often how they are able to subsequently participate in angel
investing. Their ﬁrst-hand experience in building a new venture can greatly enhance
their ability to add value to the ventures in which they invest. Prior entrepreneurial
experience is also likely to enhance their ability to inﬂuence the entrepreneurs in
which they invest, given their speciﬁc and valuable expertise in the ﬁeld. Politis and
Landstrom (2002) go so far as to suggest that a more accurate understanding of
angel investors needs to deal with them as entrepreneurs even as they are in the midst
of investing.
H6: Investors with more investing experience will experience more successes and
fewer failures.
H7: Investors with more entrepreneurial experience will have more successes and
fewer failures.
In total, these characterize a robust venture capital perspective for angel investing.
The above arguments suggest that angel investors will have more successful and
fewer failed investments as they:
.

invest in new ventures that are in somewhat later stages of development;
conduct more due diligence prior to making their investments;
ﬁnd venture investment opportunities from a broader set of sources;
invest in opportunities where other investors are also involved;
participate with the ventures after they have made their investment; and
leverage their experience as an investor and an entrepreneur.

Methodology
The data in this study covers the activities of 121 angel investors reporting on 1,038
new venture investments totalling approximately $218 million invested. The process
of study followed well-established protocol for survey research (Dilman, 2000). The
majority of the sample (75%) was reached in co-operation with 12 angel investor
groups in nine diﬀerent states. The remainder of the sample (25%) was reached
through a survey to 150 accredited members of an online investment network named
NVST, a national forum connecting investors and entrepreneurs. The total sample
reached 600 individuals known to be angel investors, attracting 136 responses for a
23% response rate, 15 of which were incomplete. While a higher response rate is of
course desirable, this is on par with prior work with venture capital investors
(Ruhnka et al., 1992; Sapienza and Gupta, 1994; Giﬀord, 1997). The bulk of the data
relate to investments over the past 10 years (90% of the sample), with the oldest
investment reported being made in 1985.

It is important to note that these data have been collected at the level of the angel
investor. One way to highlight the diﬀerence between data by investor, rather than
by venture, is that while 121 investors in this study were involved in 1,038 ventures,
those ventures may well have more than 121 total investors. For each angel investor,
detailed data on the outcomes for each investment was gathered in order to calculate
their distribution of returns, in combination with aggregate measures of their
approach to making those investments. For example, the due diligence measure is
the average time they typically spend on due diligence as they make new venture
investments, rather than the due diligence speciﬁcally spent on each investment.
This method aﬀords two key advantages. First, it allows the calculation of
outcomes over an investor’s entire angel investment portfolio. When data are
collected by venture, the angel investor’s returns can certainly be calculated for that
venture, but their other investments need to be considered in order to reasonably
estimate overall outcomes, requiring a reversion to gathering data in a similar
fashion to the method used here. Collecting data by angel investor could potentially
still report each variable for each venture separately, but pre-tests with investors
showed that they simply would not or could not respond to this somewhat
overwhelming level of detail. As a compromise, outcome measures were collected for
each venture, but the process measures were collected in aggregate fashion. Second,
this method allows feasible data collection from many more angel investors than any
other method. For perspective, one must consider the low base rate of angel
investment in new ventures (perhaps 20% of new ventures take on angel investment),
as well as the response rate for those angel investors that are identiﬁed (in this study
the rate is 23%). Based on these estimates, gathering a similar sample of angel
investors ‘by venture’ rather than ‘by investor’ would require responses from
potentially 3,000 new ventures and follow up with the 600 angel investors that they
may or may not identify in a reachable fashion. The method used in the present
study took nearly two years of data collection time, and was still signiﬁcantly more
feasible than reaching 3,000 new ventures and their angel investors.
As with any choice, beneﬁts come with trade-oﬀs. In this case, the risk of double
counting ventures and self-selection bias are the primary issues. Double counting the
outcomes of ventures would occur where two responding investors were owners in
the same venture. If this occurred in a substantial enough number of cases, the
conclusions drawn in this paper would potentially be confounded by venture speciﬁc
factors rather than the investor approach factors predominantly used in this paper.
As a result of gathering data by angel investor, this cannot be speciﬁcally controlled
for, but two points suggest that it is not a dominant factor in the results. First, there
is no correlation between speciﬁc angel group membership and outcomes, a unit of
investors very likely to share and co-report the investment outcomes from the same
venture. Second, further investigation with the group contributing the largest
number of respondents, nearly 100 investments were reported and only two of the
investors were jointly in one venture. Additionally, the geographic dispersion of the
sample in total (data resulted from investment in at least 15 diﬀerent states)
minimizes the potential for double counting.
One of the other concerns of sampling on the investors, rather than going through
new ventures, is a self-selection risk; particularly that investors might only respond if
they had been successful overall, and/or only report their positive returns. Given the

<-----Page 8----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 15:54 22 April 2008

350

R. Wiltbank

lack of empirical data on the population of angel investors, this is an incredibly
diﬃcult notion to disprove. However, comparison with other empirical work
suggests that it is not central concern. The stage and age emphases of respondents
are well in line with case study work: 73% occurred at the seed and start-up stage,
and 75% of the ventures were less than two years old (Prowse, 1998). More
importantly, respondents reported the majority of their investments as losses, nearly
two-thirds of their exits occurred at a loss, while only 20% of their investments were
successful (the remaining exits resulted in small positive returns), which is actually
more failure than reported in other work with angel investors (Lumme et al., 1996;
Mason and Harrison, 2002).
These two risks with this method, double counting and self selection bias, cannot
be controlled for directly. However, for the reasons stated it appears that they are
unlikely to dominate the ﬁndings. This understanding of the sample and tradeoﬀs
inherent in its selection set the stage for more careful deﬁnition of the speciﬁc
variables and models used to test the hypotheses.
Independent Variables
.

.
.
.

.

.

.
.

Total Venture Investments is simply the total number of investments an investor
has made, and represents a control for overall activity to standardize the number
of exits in each category.
Investment experience is measured as the number of years over which the
respondent has been investing in new ventures.
Entrepreneurial experience is measured as the number of years over which the
respondent worked as an entrepreneur.
Seed stage is measured as the number of a respondent’s investments made in
seed stage opportunities rather than start up, early growth, late growth, and
buy-outs.
Due Diligence is measured as the total number of hours that the investor spends
investigating the entrepreneur’s references, and the venture’s market, customers,
and operation. This variable was logged for the regressions to normalize it.
Personal Relationships is measured as the respondent’s report of their number of
investments that came from a personal relationship with the entrepreneur, either
as friends, having previously worked together, or the entrepreneur was referred
to the investor through a friend.
Co-investors is measured as the number of a respondent’s investments in which
there were other investors prior to that investment.
Participation, post investment, is measured as the number of hours per week they
spend with ventures in which they have already made an investment. This
variable was logged for the regressions to normalize it.

Dependent Variable
In a perfect world, every investor would report the amount and date of their cash
outﬂows and inﬂows for each new venture in which they invest. Internal rates of
return could then be calculated in ﬁne detail. However, several issues make
measuring investor performance more challenging. First, not all angel investors track

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 15:54 22 April 2008

Informal Venture Investors

351

their cash inﬂows and outﬂows in perfect detail, and they often occur over a large
number of years so that details are not readily accessible. As a result, gathering data
for each of the 1,038 deals at that level of detail simply was not possible.
It would also be useful to gather just a summary statistic per exit event, potentially
IRR among others, and use that as the measure of success. However, through
interviews with angel investors, not everyone tracks their outcomes in the same
fashion. There are no formal reporting requirements to limited partners, and
therefore no standardized method or statistic, not to mention the diﬃculty in
recalling the exact IRR for each deal.
With these things in mind, and for comparison purposes with Mason and
Harrison (2002), outcomes were measured in categories of IRR achieved in each exit.
The IRR categories allow for a margin of error in the details of IRR calculation, and
still allow the evaluation of the distribution of an investor’s returns. Of the 1,038
investments, investors had exited from 414 of them. While there is certainly more
information to be gleaned by looking at all of the investments, performance
measures in new venture investing are consistently more reasonable when looking
only at actual exits. As a result, the hypotheses are tested using only exited
investments.
For purposes of hypothesis testing, outcomes were grouped in three categories,
those that returned less than their capital invested, those exiting with an IRR of 0%
to 99%, and those exiting at 100% or greater. The models for moderate exits were
not signiﬁcant as only 36 investors reported exits in this category, so only the
homerun and negative IRR models are shown.
.
.

Homerun is the number of investment exits where the investor achieved greater
than 100% internal rate of return.
Negative IRR is the number of investment exits where the investor achieved a
negative Internal Rate of Return.

While these two categories anchor the regression modelling and hypothesis testing,
additional descriptive detail in relation to earlier studies will be discussed later in the
paper. The descriptive break down of exits across all of the categories, for example, is
shown in Figure 2.
Results
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics and correlations for the variables, while Table 2
shows the regression models. The measures used in the models are predominantly
sums of the number of investments made in various constructs. To standardize these
sums a control for the overall activity of each investor is included. Essentially, the
more investments they have made the more investments they will have for all of the
measures.
Hypothesis 1 argued that as angel investors make investments in later stage deals,
reducing their investments in seed stage ventures, they will experience fewer failures.
This was not supported. Regressions in Table 2 in fact show the opposite. As
investors made more seed stage investments they experienced signiﬁcant reductions
in investments that exited at a negative IRR.

Figure 2. Distribution of returns in early stage investing

Hypothesis 2 suggested that as angels invest more time in their due diligence
eﬀorts, they will experience more success and fewer failures. This hypothesis was
partially supported, as due diligence was signiﬁcantly related to an increase in
homerun exits. However, more due diligence was also moderately related to an
increase, not a decrease, in negative exits.
In addition to seed stage investing, and due diligence eﬀorts, the source of an
investor’s new venture opportunities is expected to impact their outcomes.
Speciﬁcally, as angel investors invest in opportunities that result merely from their
own personal network rather than a broader ﬂow of deals, they will have fewer
successes and more failures. This hypothesis received no support.
Hypothesis 4 argues that as angel investors invest with other investors they
will experience more success and fewer failed investments. This hypothesis was
not supported, as it was not signiﬁcantly related to either positive or negative
exits.
Hypothesis 5 argued that as angel investors participate more with the ventures in
which they invest they will experience more success and less failure. This hypothesis
was partially supported, as participation was signiﬁcantly related to experiencing
fewer negative exits.
In addition to these direct investment variables, investing and entrepreneurial
experience were expected to capture other aspects that may be outside the speciﬁc
scope of those practices from venture capital research. However, both types of
experience were unrelated to either homerun or negative exits.
These ﬁndings do not suﬀer from multicollinearity (no tolerance statistic was
smaller than 0.5) and are robust to split samples; where the models were run only
with investors having made three or more exits, with only seven years or more
experience, and ﬁnally by deleting the ﬁve highest and ﬁve lowest performers.

In sum, the key results in relation to the practices from formal venture capital
research are:
.
.
.

Outside of overall activity, experience had little impact on outcomes;
investing in earlier stages (not later stages) and more participation post
investment related to fewer negative exits; and
investors who did more due diligence experienced more failures, but also more
homeruns.

In addition to this evaluation of formal venture investing practices among angel
investors, it is interesting to compare the results of this sample with the results
reported in Mason and Harrison (2002). Figure 2 highlights the primary comparison
surrounding the distribution of returns to angel investors, and also includes data
from Murray (1999) on individual investment returns to venture capital investments.
In total, the table shows that the US angel investor returns are more similar in
distribution to those of the venture capital project returns reported by Murray
(1999), with results from the UK angels having signiﬁcantly fewer negative exits,
primarily shifted into the middle categories. Clearly, all three samples show a strong
negative skew in early stage investing, representing the risk involved.
In addition to the distribution of returns, Mason and Harrison (2002) report the
length of holding period and the performance consequences of stage, technology,
and deal size. In these areas, ﬁndings are quite similar. UK angels had a median
holding period of four years for successful exits, and only two years for negative to
break even exits. In this sample of US angel investors, lemons also ripened faster
than plums, though somewhat more slowly. The median time to successful exits was
5.8 years, while the median of negative exits occurred at 3.5 years (with about 1 year
of standard deviation around each).
Similar to the data for the UK angels, few meaningful relationships to outcomes
for angel investors were found when looking at stage, sector, or deal size. The
primary exception to this relates to seed stage investments (discussed above) where
investors experienced negative exits signiﬁcantly less as they invested in seed stage
opportunities. In total 75% of the investments were made in the seed and start-up

stages, which were correspondingly young ﬁrms of two years or less, representative
of the very early stage eﬀorts of angel investors. However, the stage of investments,
beyond seed, did not distinctly relate to outcomes. Likewise, while the average dollar
amount of an investor’s investments (mean ¼ $ 210,000, median ¼ $ 60,000) did lead
to signiﬁcantly more due diligence, it did not have a direct eﬀect on the outcomes of
their investing. Finally, industry categories, collected in categories of hardware,
software, telecommunications, healthcare, retail and manufacturing, also did not
have any signiﬁcant impact on the outcomes to these investors (the majority of deals
in this sample were made in the software category (57%) with the other categories
evenly splitting the remainder).
Conclusion
This study makes two primary contributions. First, it brings together a baseline
model of investment variables from formal venture capital research into a single
model to evaluate their role in angel investor outcomes. Second, it represents a broad
based study of angel investing practices, detailing US angel investment outcomes for
the ﬁrst time.
The regression models in this study characterize a traditional investor perspective
of factors involved in venture investing outcomes. While certainly others, particularly
factors that are harder to measure like management talent or execution, are part of
the mix, this model is a useful application of venture investing principles. Several of
these factors are empirically important in angel investor outcomes. First, the ﬁnding
that seed stage investments were actually related to fewer negative exits is particularly
important to angel investors. Normally these earlier stage opportunities are assumed
to be more risky and less likely to provide a positive outcome. It may be, however,
that these earlier stage opportunities eﬀectively ﬁt the expertise of angel investors.
Due diligence and post investment participation also had some impact angel
investor outcomes. Due diligence among angel investors is not practiced consistently
and ranged in this study from only a couple of hours to over 200 hours of time spent
on due diligence prior to investing. However, the average due diligence in this study
is over 40 hours, which does dispel some of the perception that angel investors jump
into deals without doing meaningful investigation, but is signiﬁcantly fewer hours
than is typically spent on due diligence by formal venture capitalists. When looking
at only investors with exits, the extent of their due diligence was signiﬁcantly related
to an increase in investors’ negative and homerun exits. Clearly, the causal aspects of
this relationship are not yet clear. Are the riskier opportunities driving an increase in
due diligence eﬀort? Alternatively, do due diligence eﬀorts assist in ﬁnding riskier but
higher potential deals? Or do investors willing to do more due diligence also have a
willingness to do riskier deals? In combination with the eﬀect of post investment
participation on reducing negative exits, these ﬁndings make a case for the active role
of angel investors in their success.
Broadly, these ﬁndings begin to outline the aspects of formal venture capital
investing are speciﬁcally relevant to angel investing, as well as those that are less so.
This is particularly useful to angel groups that have been increasing in formality, and
suggests that they need to carefully consider which formal venture capital practices
are well suited for their approach to angel investing.

This study represents the ﬁrst data set of angel investor outcomes in the USA.
From a descriptive standpoint, failures occur in nearly two-thirds of angel
investments, while 20% of the exits were over 100% IRR. This return distribution
is very similar to the distribution of returns reported for individual investments of
venture capitalists (Murray, 1999) but signiﬁcantly higher failure than reported for
UK angels by Mason and Harrison (2002). Clearly, angel investing is a risky
proposition, but presents accordingly large potential successes. In short, angel
investing continues to appear to be ‘worth it’. In fact, if one assumes that the
investment size is comparable across an investor’s investments (this is not a trivial
assumption), the overall cash to cash multiple for this sample is 2.9 in the 5.8 years
that they held their successful investments, a respectable rate of return depending on
how extensively one might adjust for risk.
The study makes key contributions by evaluating a broad set of traditional
investment factors in the angel investment setting, and establishing the role of active
angels in eﬀecting the distribution of their returns. In combination with the few
earlier studies on angel investing outcomes, a clearer picture of the investment
performance of informal venture capital investors is developing. Additional
studies into the approach and returns of angel investors can help to reﬁne the
practice of very early stage venture investing, and inform the organization of angel
investor groups as well as policy makers seeking to co-ordinate angel investing as an
important aspect of encouraging and ﬁnancing entrepreneurial endeavours.
