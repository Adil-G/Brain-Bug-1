Cultural Values and the
Championing Process
Scott Shane
This study examines the relationsh ip between nationa l culture and national preferences for
Innovati on champ ion ing strategies us ing a sample of 24 national offices of a financ ial services company. The study finds that In collectivistic societies, managers prefer champions
who make personal appeals to gather cross-functional support for the Innovation effort. In
uncertainty- avoiding societies, managers prefer champ ion s to work through org anization al
norms , rules and procedures rather than violating them. In powe r-dlstant soc ietie s, managers prefer champions who closely monitor the Innovation process.

R ecently multinational corpora tions have begun to develop new businesses in their
overseas subsidiaries. Th is new business development activity has created a demand for
champions, individuals capable of overcoming organizational resistance to new business
development (Burgelman, 1983). The presence of innovation champions in multinational corporations has raised a fundamental question: Should managers champion new
business development differently in different cultural environments?
Existing research on the championing process has shown that approac hes to championing vary across corporate cultures (Howell & Higgins, 1991 ; Schon , 1963; Lawless
& Price, 199 1), and suggests that approaches might also vary across national cultures.
This paper seeks to investigate whether a relationship between national culture and
preferences for approaches to championing exists.
Three national cultural value examined in this study are identified; the ex isting
research on championing roles is reviewed and six hypotheses, which examine how
cultural values influence preferences for approaches to championing roles, are presented;
the methods used to test the hypotheses are presented , along with the data analysis and
the results; and the paper closes with conclusions and a discus ion of the implications of
this study for future research.

THREE MEASURES OF CULTURAL VALUES
National culture is the set of values and beliefs shared by members of a particular
society (Hofstede, 1980). Much research has demonstrated that national culture influences managerial behavior (Hofstede, 1980; Schneider, 1991). However, no research
has yet examined how cultural values influence championing behavior.
Despite the absence of direct research on the national culture/championing relationship, ex isting research on the relationship between cultural values and managerial behavior suggests that championing should vary across national cultural environments.
Given the wealth of research on the cultural values/managerial behavior relationship , a
co mprehensive test of this hypothesis is not undertaken here. Rather , this study focuses
on the relationship between three well-known cultural values and six dimensions of
championing .

<-----Page 1----->These values are individualism , power distance, and uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 1980). Individualism represents the preference for a social framework in which
people put themselves and their immediate families first, as opposed to collectivism,
which puts the extended family or social group first (Hofstede, 1980). Power distance
measures the social acceptability of an unequal distribution of power (Hofstede, 1980).
Uncertainty avoidance represents a society's tolerance for ambiguous situations (Hofstede, 1980).
These values were chosen for two reasons. First, they influence many managerial
behaviors closely related to championing roles . Second, substantial research has documented their usefulness in large sample survey studies (Hofstede. 1980; Hofstede &
Bond, 1984; The Chinese Culture Connection , 1987; Hoppe, 1990).

CULTURAL VALUES AND CHAMPIONING ROLES
Schon (1963) initiated the study of championing . He found that innovation was more
successful if a champion promoted it. Subsequent research has identified a number of
roles that champions play in the development of new technology , new products, and new
businesses . Prevailing wisdom defines champions as individuals who go beyond their
formal roles in organizations to promote the development of a new product, process , or
business (Lawless & Price, 1992; Venkataraman, MacMillan , & McGrath, 1992;
Burgelman , 1983; Chakrabarti, 1989).
Many scholars have sought to identify the roles that champions adopt to promote
innovation and new business development. They have taken different approaches towards understanding these roles . Some scholars have viewed championing roles from
the perspective of leadership theory (Howell & Higgins , 1990), while others have
viewed championing roles through the perspective of agency theory (Lawless & Price,
1992). Still others have taken a deductive view and have documented championing roles
they observed in organizations (Burgelman, 1983; Frost & Egri, 1991; Chakrabarti ,
1989).
This paper examines six championing roles that have been observed by scholars in
their fieldwork on either the innovation or the new product development process in
organizations. These six are: (1) the role of protecting innovators from the rules, procedures. and systems of the organization (Burgelman, 1983; Pinchot, 1987; Howell &
Higgins, 1991 ; Schon, 1963); (2) the role of monitoring the innovation process (Souder ,
1981; Sathe, 1988; Kanter, 1986; Howell & Higgins , 1991); (3) the role of facilitating
decisions on the development of new ideas and technologies (Burgelman , 1983, 1984;
Howell & Higgins, 1991; Souder, 1981); (4) the role of establishing cross-functional ties
between members of the innovation team so that all necessary parts of the organization
can be employed to develop the new idea or business (Kanter , 1988; Howell & Higgins,
1991 ; Schon , 1963); (5) the role of persuading organization members of the value of the
innovation (Chakrabarti , 1974; Curley & Gremillion, 1983; Frohman, 1978; Howell &
Higgins, 1991); and (6) the role of keeping the innovation from being blocked by the
organizational hierarchy (Burgelman , 1983; Schon, 1963; Curley & Gremillion, 1983).
It is important to note that these six championing roles are not viewed by all scholars
as crucial to the innovation or new business development processes . in fact, some
scholars have questioned the importance of some or all of them (Lawless & Price, 1992).
To date no consensus among scholars has developed as to which championing roles are
important. Moreover, resource constraints precluded the distribution of a survey that
inquired about all championing roles either observed or theorized . The lack of unanimity
combined with resource constraints meant that this study could not be comprehensive,

26

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->and only certain championing roles were selected for investigation. The selection heuristic was threefold. First, the championing roles selected had to be observed by scholars
in actual field settings. Second , the roles had to be observed by at least three researc hers.
Third , some theoretical basis for believing that these championing roles would vary
across national cultures had to exist .
Champions make choices about the approaches that they adopt to accomplis h each
of these championing roles . However, existing research on cultural values sugges ts that
national preferences for these approaches may exist. In the section below, the different
approaches to championing roles are identified and hypotheses about how cultural values
influence these approaches are developed.

eros -Functional Ties
Since innovation requires effort on the part of individuals in many functional areas
(Kanter , 1988), one championing role is to establish linkages between individuals in
differe nt parts of the organization who can contribute to the innovation effort. The
existing research on champions has shown that they approach this problem in two ways .
One approach is to use personal contacts rather than formal channels to test ideas and
gather resources (Schon, 1963). The champion taps personal relationships across functional areas to gain the "release of key people, space, resources, charters, produc tion
time or a customer contact" (Galbraith, 1982, p. 24). An alternative approach is to gain
organizational approval for the innovation and u e individuals from different functional
areas assigned to assist with the innovation effort to build necessary cross-functional ties
(Burgelman, 1983).
Managers in collectivist societies are expected to prefer the personal approach.
People in collectivist cultures have been shown to be more likely to use personal
interaction to gather information (Schneider, 1991; Yoshino, 1979). Moreover, the
intense socialization of workers (Abegglen, 1958) and extensive job rotation (Dore,
1973) in these societies reinforces group norms and ties and creates a preference among
people in such cultures for championing on the basis of personal relationships. Thi
argument leads to the first hypothesis:
HI : The less individualistic a society , the more people prefer champions to make
personal appeals to gather cross-functional support for an innovation.

Decision Making
Innovation is an uncertain activity . As such, it demands many decisio ns. The second
role for champions is to establish a decision-making mechanism for the innovation. The
existing research on champions has shown that they approach this problem in two ways .
One approach is to include all members of the organization, regardles of position ,
in the decision -making process (Howell & Higgins, 1991). This "bottom-up " process
(Burgelman, 1983, p. 229), which employs " management by consensus" (Howell &
Higgins , 1991 , p. 48), avoids the problems created when decisions are made by senior
managers who do not devote sufficient time to the innovation (Souder, 198 1). It also
allows the champion to include the idea generator , who is "usually a low level person"
(Galbraith, 1982, p. 10).
An alternative approach is to limit decision making to higher-level managers . Research has shown that without an influential person behind an innovation , it is more
likely to fail (Curley & Gremillion, 1983). Therefore , the champion needs to ensure that
Summer, 1994

27

<-----Page 3----->the innovation decision maker is someone who has sufficient power and influence in the
company (Schon, 1963) and who controls resources (Maidique, 1980; Roberts, 1977).
Managers in power-distant societies are expected to prefer the latter approach.
Schneider (1991) explains that in power-distant societies decision making is reserved for
senior managers who are considered superior in their decision-making ability to other
organization members , a view consistent with research by Hofstede ( 1980), Crozier
( 1964), O'lrbarne ( 1989), and Granick ( 1972). This emphasis on limiting decision
making to higher-status individuals makes managers in power-distant societies uncomfortable with the idea of having low-status individuals participate as equal partners with
higher-status individuals in the decision-making process. The differences between high
and low power-d istant cultures leads to the following hypothesis about championing
behavior:
H2: The greater the power distance of a society, the less people prefer champions to
include all the members of the organization in the innovation decision-making
process.

Persuasion
Successful innovation requires the acceptance of a new idea by members of the
organization (Lawless & Price, 1992). This acceptance is enhanced by efforts to convince others of the value of the innovation (Curley & Gremillion, 1983) and by packaging it in an appea ling way (Chakrabarti, 1974). The third championing role is to
persuade members of the organization to provide support for the innovation. The existing research on champions has shown that they approach this problem in two ways.
One approach is for the champion to do a formal feasibility analysis for the project
(Frohman, 1978). Under this approach, the champion rationally demonstrates the value
of the innovation through cost-benefit analysis and other quantitative approaches (Howell & Higgins, 1991). By using plans, budgets, financial projections, and presentations
of prototypes (Frohman, 1978; Howell & Higgins, 1991), the champion convince other
managers of the need for the innovation.
An alternative approach is for the champion to convince others to support the
innovation on the basis of arguments not based on "formal analytic techniques"
(Burgelrnan, 1983, p. 233). This usually means convincing others of the need for the
innovation on the basis of its fit with the strategic mission of the company, the corporate
culture (Burgelman, 1983), or a "vision of the potential of an innovation" (Howell &
Higgins, 1990 , p. 320), which appeals "to larger principles or unassailable values about
the potential of the innovation for fulfilling the organization's dream of what it can be"
(Howell & Higgins, 1990 , p. 336).
Managers in uncertainty-avoiding societies are expected to prefer the more formal
approach. In uncertainty-avoiding societies. such as France , managers generally prefer
to use formal mechanisms such as projections and budgets to cope with uncertain events
(Crozier, 1964). They avoid uncertainty by using extensive planning and quantitative
analysis (Horovitz, 1978; Hofstede, 1980). This desire to employ planning and quantitative analysis leads managers in these societies to prefer champions who convince
others to support an innovation on the basis of plans, budgets, and financial analyses .
The differences between uncertainty-avoiding and uncertainty-accepting cultures leads
to the following hypothesis about championing behavior.
H3: The higher the uncertainty-avoidance of a society, the more people prefer
champions who gain support for new ideas by using formal mechanisms such as
projections and plans.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACnCE

<-----Page 4----->Hierarch y
Innovation is more likely to succeed in organizations if members of the organizational hierarchy do not block it. Therefore , the fourth championin g role is to guide the
innovation past potential hierarchical obstacles to the innovation effort. The existing
research on champions has shown that they approach this problem in two ways .
One approach is for the champion to operate outside the organizational hierarchy.
Following this approach, the champion uses informal communication channels rather
than the formal hierarchy to promote the innovation (Schon, 1963). He or she allows the
innovators to set up a " skunk works" (Burgelman, 1983), which enables the innovation
team to make ad hoc decisions and to acquire resources through non-traditional channels .
An alternative approach is for the champion to use the organizational hierarchy to
advance the innovation (Witte, 1973). Under this approach, the champion uses his or her
skills to convince senior management of the value of the innovation rather than to
circumvent the hierarchy (Burgelman, 1983). The champion stays in close contact with
senior management in order to ensure their continued support for the innovation (Burgelman , 1983). As a result , the champion is viewed as a surrogate for senior management
(Curley & Gremill ion, 1983). This permits the champion to punish those who oppose the
innovation and reward those who support it (Witte, 1973).
Managers in collectivistic societies are expected to prefer the latter approach. People
in collectivistic societies place a strong emphasis on preserving social harmony (Ouchi,
1980). They believe that people should not take actions that might conflict with the
decisions of their superiors because this may embarrass their superiors (Hofstede, 1980).
Mann ( 1980) has noted that collectivist societies are ones in which people are more
accepting of authority, and ones in which people are more likely to change their beliefs
to match those of their superiors. The tendency to adhere to authority structures leads
managers in collectivist societies to prefer champions who work within the organizational hierarchy, rather than circumventing it. The differences between individualistic
and collectivistic cultures leads to the following hypothesis about preferences for championing behavior:
H4: The greater the collectivism of a society, the more people prefer champions who
establish support for an innovation through established hierarchical channels.

Monitoring
Innovation is more successful if appropriate mechanisms are used to control it
(Sathe , 1988). The fifth role for champions is to monitor the innovation team to ensure
that they accomplish their goals. The existing research on champions has shown that
they approach this problem in two ways .
One approach is to establish a monitoring system that is non-directive (Galbraith,
1982). This means that the champion gives participants in the innovation effort a clear
mandate to independently develop their projects and imposes few controls on the process
(Souder, 1981) .
An alternative approach is to give innovators "sufficient authority and budget to
perform the first phase or stage of activities" (Souder, 1981 , p. 20), and require them
to return for authority or funding for "each subsequent stage." Under this approach ,
progress reports and frequent meetings are used to gain authority and resources to
proceed with each step of the innovation process (Howell & Higgins, 1991).
Managers in power-distant societies are expected to prefer the latter approach.
Power distance reflects a preference for the concentration of authority at high levels in
SUmmer. 1994

29

<-----Page 5----->organizations (Hofstede, 1980; Tayeb , 1988). This concentration of authority makes
managers uncomfort able with the idea of giving resources and authority to lower level
members of the organization to develop innovations without direct control by senior
management. The differences between high and low power-distant cultures leads to the
following hypothesis about championing behavior :
H5: The higher the power distance of a society, the more people prefer champion s
to closely monitor innovators.

Autonomy
The sixth role of champions is to minimize conflict between the actions of innovators
and the rules, procedures, and systems of the organization so that the innovators can
develop creative solutions to problems. The existing research on champions has shown
that they approach this problem in two ways.
The first approach is to make it possible for innovators to break rules and standard
operating procedures by protecting them from punishment or organizational interference
when they violate these norms and rules (Galbraith , 1982; Howell & Higgins, 1990;
Curley & Gremillion , 1983). Under this approach the champion provides access to
resources from bootlegged funds (Chakrabarti, 1974; Howell & Higgins , 1990; Schon ,
1963; Burgelman , 1983) and allows innovators to "cut comers in corporate procedures"
(Burgelman, 1983, p. 233). He or she allows the innovators to work without formal
authorization and in violation of bureaucratic rules (Howell & Higgins , 1991 ).
An alternative approach is to encourage the innovators to alter the innovation to meet
the characteristics of the organization . Under this approach the champion motivates the
innovators to develop new ideas that fit the strategy and conform with the culture of the
firm (Venkataraman, MacMillan , & McGrath, 1992) . Conflict with organizational
norms, rules, and procedures is minimized by encouraging managers to conform to
them .
Managers in uncertainty-avoiding societies are expected to prefer the latter approach . Managers in these societies are less likely than managers in other societies to
violate organizational rules and social norms (Hofstede, 1980; Milgram , 1961 ; Mann,
1980). This belief in social conformity makes them uncomfortable with championing
behaviors that violate organizational rules, norms, and procedures. The difference s
between uncertainty-avoiding and uncertainty-accepting cultures leads to the following
hypothesis about championing behavior:
H6: The higher the uncertainty-avoidance of a society, the less people prefer champions who allow innovators to violate norms, rules and procedures.

METHODOLOGY
Sample
The sample consists of 24 national offices of a single financial services company
from which 937 managers responded to a Cross-Cultural Championing Survey. The
compan y from which the respondents were drawn has offices in 107 countries and
employs over 50,000 people. Its primary activities are in accountin g and consulting.
The choice of this organization is important since the characteristics of the organization may have an impact on organizational dynamics and hence the results of the
study. The financial services industry is one in which there is less managerial discretion
than in many other industries. Fewer opportunities for discretion means that national

differences in any type of organizational behavior, including championing roles. should
be less common in financial services than in many other industries. Moreover, this
organization spends a large portion of its resources, both time and money, to train and
socialize employees in the company's way of doing business. This approach creates a
strong organizational culture that should lessen national cultural differences in managerial behavior (Hofstede, Neuijen, Ohayv, & Sanders, 1990). Therefore. selection of this
organization provides a more conservative test of the hypotheses than if an organization
from another industry were selected .
A single organization was selected to follow the logic of Hofstede (1980) and others
who explain that one should control for differences in organizational culture by comparing national offices of the same organization. By comparing respondents who are
matched on corporate culture , one can argue that differences between the responses of
managers are a function of differences in national culture, not of any organizational
culture effects.
The respondents were mostly male, highly educated, experienced, and drawn from
across all functional areas of the organization.

Data Analysis
The analysis presented in this study was conducted at the organizational level.
Cultures are dimensions of nations or organizations rather than of individuals . Given this
characteristic, analysis of the data at the organizational rather than the individual level
is important to provide an accurate picture of country-level differences (Leung & Bond,
1989; Hofstede et aI., 1990).
Factor analysis was used to simplify the data . Factor analysis was selected because
Hofstede 's (1980) cultural values scores were based on it, and the use of factor analysis
permitted the direct comparison of Hofstede's cultural values scores with the measures
developed from this study (Hoppe, 1990). Moreover, at the country level of analysis,
non-factorial techniques have confirmed the results from factor analysis (Hoppe , 1990;
Ronen & Shenkar, 1985).
A number of techniques were used to ensure the reliability of this analysis. To ensure
stable organization means , only national offices with 20 or more respondents were
included (Hofstede , 1980; Hoppe, 1990). For five-point Likert scales, mean scores for
20 or more respondents are stable against the extreme responses of a small number of
respondents . Moreover, since group mean scores are highly dependent on assumptions
of normality, the data were examined for skewness and kurtosis, and no deviations from
normality were found. Finally, the analysis used trimmed means and medians to develop
the measures of championing. Each of these measures controlled for one or another
possible bias in the data. The use of trirruned means eliminates the distortive effects of
extreme outliers (Hildebrand, 1986), while median values allow for the possibility that
the questions are ordinal rather than cardinal scales (Hofstede et aI., 1990). All approaches generated identical results .

Measures
The independent variables were Hofstede's (1980) measures of individualism, uncertainty-avoidance, and power distance. The scores are taken directly from Hofstede
and Bond (1988 , pp. 12-13) . The use of Hofstede 's measures of national cultural values
provide two advantages for testing the hypotheses over other measures of cultural values. First , they permit the use of reliable and validated measures (Hambrick & Brandon,
SUmmer. 1994

.

1988) . Second, they permit the rejection of the alternative hypothesis that the results are
an artifact of same-source bias. If a survey of cultural values were administered to the
same respondents as answered the championing questions, one would not be able to rule
out the possibility that correlations between the two measures were simply an artifact of
the tendency of people to answer similarly all questions posed to them .
The dependent variables were organizational-level scores on the championing roles
developed from an ecological (country level) factor analysis of 14 questions about
preferences for innovation-championing strategies. To create championing score , the
championing items were factor analyzed at the organization level , based on mean scores
for the national offices. Four of the hypothesized six championing dimensions were
identified . Table I shows the results of the factor analysis and the four stable championing dimensions: Autonomy, Cross-Functional Ties, Monitoring, and Decision Making.
National championing scores for these factors were computed using the regression
method and are shown in Table 2. To adhere to the cultural values score scales, they
have been normalized to fall between 0 and 100 .
Following the recommendation of Franke , Hofstede , and Bond (199 1), who argued
that outliers might distort the analysis when the number of countries under investigation
is smaller than thirty, Spearman Rank correlations between the three cultural values
measures and the relevant championing factors were examined to test the hypotheses .

champions in different cultures. It seeks to blend the championing and cross-cultural
management literatures in order to develop and test theories about innovation championing across cultures. The study has two goals. The first goal is to demonstrate that
country-level measures of championing strategy can be reduced to meaningful factors,
which represent the underlying structure of championing strategy across countries. This
goal has been achieved . Four dimensions of championing behavior that vary across
countries have been identified.
The second goal of the study is to find out if significant relationships exist between
cultural values and championing strategies . The study has succeeded in demonstrating
support for three of the six hypothesized relationships. Collectivism is associated with a
preference for appealing to group norms. Uncertainty-avoidance is associated with ruleadhering championing strategies, and power distance is associated with favoring monitoring. Table 3 summarizes the results.
The results show that the national cultural value of individualism is significant ly
correlated (rho = - .438, at the p < .025 level) with the preference for champions who
attract support for the innovation by appealing to group norms and personal ties. This
result indicates that in nations in which people are more collectivistic, the preferred
championing strategy is to make personal appeals to other members of the company
group.

The resu lts here are interesti ng in light of findings that stress the importance of the
championing role of creating cross -functional ties . Schon (1961) argued that the champion should create cross-functional ties to promote the development of an innovation .
Frost and Egri (1991 ) explain that the champion should negotiate with other groups both
inside and outside the organization to gather their assistance in promoting the innovation . They argue that " strategy of developing lateral support (coalitions, con sensus ) in
other areas of the organization has often proven to be critical to innovation success "
(Frost & Egri , 1991, p. 265). Howell and Higgins ( 1990) explain that champions use
coalition-formation strategies to promote innovation efforts. However, the data from this
study indicate that in individua listic socie ties, people prefer champions not to make
personal appeals to gather cross-functional support for the innovation effort. This finding
suggests that previous research on championing roles may be culture bound .
Uncertainty avoidance is significantly correlated (rho = - .352 at the p < .05 level ),
with the preference for champions who break organizational norms, rules, and procedures . Thi s result suggests that in nations in which people are more uncertaintyavoiding, the preferred championing strategy is to work within organizational rules ,
norms, and procedures.
This result suggests the fallacy of assuming the universality of domestic approaches
to the championing role of protecting organization members from rules, procedures , and
systems. A number of authors (Burgelman, 1983, 1984; Pinchot , 1987; Schon, 1963;
Souder , 1981) have recommended that innovat ion champio ns hide innovative activities
for as long as is possible, bootleg resources for these projects, and cut comers in
corporate procedures . Souder (1981) argues that a champion should hide a project during
its initial stages and should charge resource s to other budget items. Schon (1961) argued
that champions should break organizational rules, norms , and procedures in the promotion of an innovation. Frost and Egri ( 199 1, p. 261) argue that a champion hould violate
the organization 's rules and boundaries and state that "asking for forgivene s is a viable
strategy when pursuing product innovation ." Pinchot ( 1987, p. 18) writes "Do anything
needed to move your idea forward . If you're supposed to be in research but the problem
is in a manufacturing process , sneak into the pilot plant and build a new process . . . .
Needless to say, this isn't always appreciated, and so you have to remember that it is
easier to ask for forgiveness than for permiss ion. If you go around asking, you are going
to get answers you don 't want , so just do the things that need to be done and ask later ."

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY ond PRACTlCE

<-----Page 10----->In the U.S. context, in which these authors were conducting research , the data from this
study indicate that this type of championing behavior is appropriate, as it is in other
uncertainty-accepting societies. But in uncertainty-avoiding societies, the data from this
study indicate that these normative prescriptions are inappropriate and will be looked
upon negatively by organizational members.
Power distance is positively correlated (rho = .49 1 at the p < .0 1 level) with a
preference for champions who promote innovation by allowing people to get the budget
and approval for only one stage of the innovation process at a time and not to allow
people to take initiative on their ideas without formal managerial approval. This result
suggests that in power-distant societies, the preferred championing strategy has a heavy
component of monitoring of the innovation process.
These findings are interesting in light of the arguments of many scholars about the
championing process. Souder (1981) argued that a champion should make it possible for
innovators to gain control over the innovation's budget proces . Kanter (1988) and
Quinn ( 1985) explain that close monitoring by champion makes it difficult for innovators to respond to the rapid pace of change that occurs during the innovation process .
" Requiring commitment to a predetermined course of action interferes with the flexibility needed for innovation" (Kanter, 1988 , p. 198). Kanter (1986, p. 529) explains
that innovation cannot be effectively managed " by rules, paperwork, and other impersonal means administered through clearly established centers of command." She also
argues that " project teams need to work unencumbered by formal plans, committees,
board approvals and other ' bureaucratic delays' that might act as a constraint against the
change in direction" (Kanter, 1988, p. 197). However , the results of this study show
that in power-distant societies, people prefer champions to use these less-flexible, morebureaucratic monitoring systems. Therefore, U.S. approaches to the championing role of
establishing loose monitoring of the innovation process should not be adopted overseas
without consideration of the cultural acceptability of that rule.
No relationship was found between power distance and championing strategies that
favor equality in decision making. One possible interpretation of this null finding is that
the hypothesis should be rejected. The rejection of this hypothesis would suggest that the
championing role of fostering equality may be universal. Such a result would be of great
value to practitioners who would not have to adapt their championing role to other
cultural environments. If adaptation were unnecessary , there would be less need for
cross-c ultural training or culturally sensitive selection of champions and the cross-border
transfer of champions would be easier and less costly.
To determine if this interpretation were correct, two additional tests would be
necessary. First, studies would need to show that no other national cultural values
influenced the choice of this championing role. Second , research would need to support
the hypothesis that power distance is not associated with the preference for this championing role. Nevertheless, the value of universal findings about championing roles is 0
great that this null finding should encourage further investigation of this championing
role in other cultural contexts.
The relationships between uncertainty avoidance and persuasion based on financial
measures and between individualism and violating organizational hierarch y could not be
tested with the data from thi study since reliable measures for the championing dimensions of persuasion and overcoming hierarchy could not be created. Therefore, no
implications could be drawn from these hypotheses.
Many organizations are faced with the need to bring to life an innovation in many
locations simultaneously. The organization in this study needed to develop a new back
office computer system. Proponents of the new computer system had to overcome
resistance of employees in multiple countries to ensure that a compatible system was
Summer. 1994

<-----Page 11----->established simultaneously in all locations. As senior manageme nt of the company
learned, the use of culturally appropriate championing strateg ies is crucial to the success
of innovations such as this computer system. At firs t, senior managers believed that the
champions should follow U.S. models. They felt that individuals who were to champion
the computer system should follow the normative prescriptions that came out of studies
of championing in the United States because these studies had shown the superiority of
certain championing strategies and implied or argued that these approaches to championing were universal .
However , the results of this study showed the managers of this company that the
definition of what are acceptable championing strategies is influenced by national cultural values. These findings suggest a reevaluation of what championing roles should be
in different cultures . They indicate that champions should use different approaches to
promote innovation in different cultures, and that approaches to champion ing that scholars have found to be useful in the United States may not be appropriate in other cultures .

Limitations of This Study
While this study achieved most of the goals set for it, its failure to demonstrate
support for ome of the specific culture-championing relationships hypothesized requires
an examination of limitations that might have affected these results. One major limitation was that of sample size. The study employed a restricted sample of countries and
had a relatively low number of respondents from each country. To accurately test the
three unsupported hypotheses, greater variance among countries may be needed .
However , operationally, such a design would have been extreme ly diffic ult . Resource restrictions on tran lation and communication, and the ability to gain access to
multiple offices of a multinational corpora tion limited this study to 24 fairly large and
industrialized countries.
Moreover, the study may not have been sufficiently large in terms of the number of
respondents per country. Since the demographic characteristics of the respondents differs across countries, a more accurate measurement of the relationships hypothesized in
this study may require the construction of country means from the means of subgro ups
based on gender , education, experience , and other demographic variab les. With the
creation of stable means dependent on the existence of samples of 20 or more, a more
accurate research design would have required samples of 200-300 in each country. Such
a design is difficult for most researchers to achieve, but it may be necessary to accurately
measure many of the relationships hypothesized.
A third limitation of the study was the decision to focus on people 's acceptance of
championing behavior rather than their actual behavior as champions. The reaso n for this
choice was resource driven. Since only one-half of the respondents had championing
experience, a sample twice as large as the one employed would have been necessary to
confine the analysis to individuals with actual championing experience. A study of those
dimensions was beyond the scope permitted by the resources available. Nevertheless,
the resulting design leaves this study open to the criticism that can be made about all
attitudinal research--that it may not hold true in actual situations.
A final limitation of the study is that it is based on the assumption that the concept
of national culture is something that exists and can be measured. Many anthropologists
question this assumption. Since this paper cannot resolve the debate between anthropologists on the one hand and sociologists and management scholars on the other over
this assumption, I believe it necessary to point out the basis for the anthropologists'
criticism as a limitation of this paper. The anthropologists' criticism of this assumption
is threefold . First, there may not be a statistical basis for arguments about the distribution
36

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->of cultural elements within populations. Second , cultural and social boundaries may not
be cotermi nous, so the nation state may not be a valid proxy for national culture. Third,
it may not be possible to compare questionnaire items about national cultural values to
items about an aspect of behavior because the behavior items and the national culture
items may be part of the same broad construct and so, by definition, be correlated.

FUTURE RESEARCH
All of this brings us to the research agenda. This study suggests two avenues for
future research. First, a theory of how and why championing behavior should vary
across cultures needs to be developed. This study has demonstrated the existence of
culture/championi ng relationships; however , it did not explain the underlying processes
that account for these results. Cultural values are unlikely to be the proximate cause of
differences in championing styles. They are more likely to create organizational norms
and routines that require certain championing styles. Further development of a tbeory
that accurately captures the pattern of the empirical relationships shown in this study will
require research into why champions in different cultures operate in different ways .
This additional effo rt would provide value-added research for practicing managers.
This study shows managers what championing styles are preferred in different countries .
It demonstrates that these differences are associated with differences in national culture.
Managers can use the results here to avoid exporting inappropriate U.S. championing
roles to other countries. However, much of the championing process is emergent. In
each country individuals emerge as champions to promote the development of innovations and new businesses in ways that are appropriate for individuals in that country. To
understand how these champions can be supported and encouraged, more research on
national differences in the championing process is necessary. We need to figure out what
happens in collectivist cultures that creates a need for the championing role of creating
coalitions of support across parts of the organization. We need to understand what
organizational norms and routines create the need for champions who closely monitor
and control innovators in power-distant societies . We need to learn what drives champions in uncertainty-avoiding culture to work within rules, norms, and standard ope rating procedures rather than doing such things as bootlegging resources or hiding their
activities.
Second, we need to identify the role played by corporate culture, national culture ,
industry , firm, stage of the innovation process, and personality characteristics of innovation champions on the choice of championing strategies. To do this, the championing
literature should expand the types of variables that are controlled in cross-national
studies of the championing phenomenon.
Hofstede et al. (1990) found that national and organizational cultures are affected by
industry , job, and function as well as demographic characteristics of the members of the
organizations. This study has strengthened our level of confidence in explaining culture/
championing relationships by demonstrating that they exist even when corporate culture
is contro lled. From this study, managers can learn that championing behaviors are not
affected just by the organization in which they work, but also by the national culture
from which they come.
However, much more work is needed. This study cannot tell managers what the
effect of the interaction of national and organizational culture is on championing behavior. Managers might wonder what differences there might be between two Japanese
managers, each of whom promotes championing in different organizations. Would these
differe nces be greater or lesser than the differences between a Japanese and a U.S . manSummer, 1994

37

<-----Page 13----->ager in the same organization? Only when studies incorporate both organizational and
national culture measures of championing behavior will it be possible to make comparisons of the effects of the two . Now that preliminary results show a relationship between
cultural value s and championing behavi or , we need to answer question s about the
structure of these relationships relati ve to other relationship .
Similarly, many scholars have shown how the characteristics of indi vidual s, the type
of innovation , the stage of the innovati on process, and the organ ization's reward structure influen ce the cbampioning roles that emerge in these organizations (Lawless &
Price , 1992; Venkataraman , MacMillan , & McGrath, 1992; Howell & Higgin s, 1990).
While this study indicates that national culture also influen ces championing roles , it does
not show how national culture interacts with these other variabl es . Managers need to
know if the effect of national culture is moderated by the type of innovation , the stage
of the innovation process, the personality of the champion , and the structure of the
organization and its reward system . Future research should include national culture in
models of the cham pioning process that examine these other influen ces. Such model s
will tell mana ger s how national culture interacts with other factors to determine championing roles.

CONCLUSIO
Recent research has sugges ted that multin ational co rporations have greater opportunities to develop new co mpetitive advantages than do domestic firm s because they are
present in more environments and these environments create the variation necessary for
the development of new competitive advantages (Ghoshal, 1987). Senior managers of
these multinational firm s need to learn how to harne ss this diver ity . One way to do this
is to actively manage new business development across multiple cultural environments.
Thi s study show s that if managers choo se this approach , they cannot simply tran sfer
U.S .-style championing overseas. To gain the support of others necessary for innovation
(Kanter, 1988), mana gers need to learn culturally appropriate innovation championing
strategies.
