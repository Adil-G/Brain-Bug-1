enture capital financing differs from more traditional equity financing
in that the venture capitalist plays a role in the management of the
companies receiving investment. In addition to its importance to
entrepreneurial enterprises, this post-investment role of the venture
capitalist is an important topic to those interested in the governance of large
corporations. Recent studies on U.S. competitiveness' have argued for changing
the American system of corporate governance to one of strong boards made up
of directors with a substantial, long-term ownership position in the company.
Lester Thurow extoUs directors such as J.P. Morgan and other financiers from
the Age of Financial Capitalism and points to modern-day American venture
capitalists as an example of the type of director that is needed for change to
occur.^ Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between venture capitalists and managers is vital for those seeking to overhaul the corporate governance
of large firms.
To examine this relationship, we conducted a series of case studies of
fourteen venture-capital financed companies. These companies were from a
wide variety of industries and geographic regions. Each was financed by a different venture capitalist. The post-investment performance of the companies varied
widely—from spectacular to mediocre to Chapter 11. (The appendix describes
the methodology and sample more fully.)
In this study, we examined the role of the venture capitalist (VC) when
serving as a "lead" investor. Often, several VCs will invest in the same firm with

one or two informally serving as the "lead," and the other VCs generally following their lead. The amount of time a VC spends with a firm may vary widely.
The average lead VC spends about 13 hours a month with the firm, while nonleads average less than 5 hours per month.'

The VCs Role
Because they are a major source of funds, VCs have a significant impact
on the firms in which they invest. In addition to providing funding, VCs can add
a variety of other inputs, such as operating services, networks, and moral support. The value of these inputs varies from company to company, with VC inputs
being used to fill the gaps between the resources needed and those already available to the company. The effectiveness of the VCs inputs also varies depending
on the VCs power in the organization. The VCs inputs thus have an effect on
firm performance. The VC can be either a constructive force, an impotent one,
or even a destructive force in the company. The main inputs the VC has to offer
are: money, operating services, networks, image, moral support, general business knowledge, and discipline.
Money
While the VC provides many inputs, the money input is what causes the
relationship with the entrepreneur to form. Even those entrepreneurs who have
had unsatisfactory relationships with VC investors usually indicate that, if doing
it over again, they would still have utilized venture capital financing since no
other viable alternatives were available.*
Operating Services
VCs provide a variety of operating services to firms, with some VCs calling
themselves "consultants with a financial interest" in the company. However, one
often hears strong statements—from both VCs and managers—that VCs should
not be involved in operations. Some go so far as to say that most VCs cannot
competently run a business.
The reason for this apparent contradiction lies in how VCs and managers
of entrepreneurial firms define operations. In the managers' view, operations are
activities requiring regular contact with mid-level or lower-level employees. The
operating services provided by the VC generally involve contact between the VC
and the top management of the company. Rarely, if ever, is there any contact
between the VC and mid- or lower-level managers. Operations, as defined by
VCs and managers, also include activities that require regular contact with outsiders. However, contact by the VC with outsiders is more permissible than such
contact by lower-level employees. This contact is generally oriented to special
projects, not normal daily activities.' For example, a VC would not make
monthly sales calls on potential key accounts.

On the other hand, a VC is expected to be very active in arranging financing.* There are three reasons for the high level of VC activity in the financing
area. First, they have significant expertise in this area. They arrange and participate in financing for several companies on an on-going basis. Second, the VC
has access to networks of financiers. Third, the pricing of any follow-up financing is an area vitally important to the performance of the VCs initial investment.
In addition to financing, there are other outside-oriented activities that
occur less frequently, such as arranging corporate partnerships or acquisitions.
Another operating service provided by VCs is helping select top management.
Except in the case of CEO selection, VCs generally do not get actively involved
in the search process, but are involved in interviewing potential managers and
then serving as a sounding board for the CEO's decision making.
VCs also serve as a sounding board for management's ideas on dealing
with a variety of other operating problems. For example, one CEO needed
advice on how to deal with a major customer who was threatening to switch
to another supplier if not granted price concessions. Another routinely received
input from VCs on possible product features.
The VCs highest level of operational services occurs when the VC takes
over management of a company. While this does happen occasionally, the attitude of most VCs is summed up by the comment of one venture capitalist:
"There are people in this business who will tell you with great pride how a company got into trouble and they hopped in and helped fix things up. I think that is
horrible. . . . When a venture capitalist becomes involved at an operating level in
a business, it's a sign that he's failed in his craft as venture capitalist."

Networks
While an entrepreneur's own networks are important to company success, the VC also has networks available to the firm. The VCs networks are particularly important to a firm attempting to raise money. Seventy percent of
venture capital investments in low innovation ventures involve co-investments
by more than one VC. Co-investment rises to 86 percent for high innovation
investments.^
VC networks are a major source of candidates for employment—primarily
for top management, but also for some lower-level managers as well. While VCs
may not actively search for managers, they are often aware of potential managers through their networks.
VC networks sometimes locate service providers. In one case, the VC had
the company switch to a law firm more familiar with start-ups. In another, the
VC located a marketing consulting firm to help management refine their marketing strategy. In both cases, the VCs thought the new service providers significantly benefitted the companies. VC networks also occasionally provide
customers.

VC networks can help find acquisitions or corporate partners. This does
not happen often, but when it does it can be quite significant. In one instance,
a start-up company formed to build a specialty semi-conductor chip used VCs
to locate a chip manufacturer to serve as corporate partner for fahrication.
VC networks can also be a valuable source of strategic information, as the
following comments by two managers demonstrate:
"If I want to find out about another company that's privately held—for example,
we did an acquisition last August—I'll take that to the venture guys because the
venture guys can sometimes talk to each other easier than I can talk to the CEO."
"Being on the board of other companies, they [can tell you] how some other
high-technology company is solving a distribution problem in Japan or in Europe,
or tell you what company they are with and how they're doing."

Image
Many VCs, especially those with a record of backing successful companies, have a positive image that is transferred to their portfolio companies.
While VC image and VC networks are closely related concepts, the VCs image
may prove helpful with people outside of the VCs network. In one case, the VC
sat in on discussions with the company's bank lender. Even though the lender
did not know the VC, his presence built up the lender's confidence.
The VCs image may also be used in marketing. Since start-up companies
often have low creditability with potential customers, a VC meeting with potential major customers can help assure that the start-up is "for real." Similarly, the
VCs image may also help convince potential managers to join the company.
Moral Support
The VC can serve as a friend and confidante of the CEO, providing an
outlet where the CEO can discuss sensitive internal issues.* In addition, the VC
can provide moral support in a time of crisis. Many managers use terms like
"supportive," "open," and "friendly" to describe their relationship with the VC.
General Business Knowledge
The concept of general business knowledge and experience is often mentioned by both VCs and managers. Both feel that it is a significant input by the
VC, as refiected in the comments of two managers:
"These are very highly experienced individuals, and I've found them to be
extremely helpful."
"He's been around and seen it all. His advice is worthwhile."

Discipline
Managers view this as a major VC input.

"Everybody reports to somebody in this world. We report to the board [controlled
by venture capitalists]. [VCs are] very bright and experienced, and very demanding. When you're public, you have enormous pressure to be profitable. And when
you're private you don't have those, but you have enormous pressure because of
the power of the board. So it exerts a positive and strong force on management in
the private environment—fear."
There are two specific ways in which discipline is exerted. One is when
VCs pressure managers to perform in accordance with the objectives established
in the business plan,' as is indicated in the following example from a CEO:
"They know general types of goals that we might have. An example would be
an average day's outstanding on accounts receivable. They might call up and say,
'You know, at the last board meeting you thought you could get average day's
outstanding down to so and so. How do you think you're doing?'"
The second way discipline is exerted is in the evaluation and replacement
of management. According to a venture capitalist: "Our job as venture capitalists
is to see that companies are well-managed, and when they're not, to fix those
deficiencies." Similarly a manager indicated: "We've made our numbers and
we've been allowed to run the company. Lord knows what would have happened if we hadn't been succeeding."
Replacing a CEO is a relatively common event for a venture capital
financed company. One study found that 40 percent of the high-performing
companies and 74% of low-performing companies had changed CEOs at
least once.'° In many of these CEO firings, while the VCs served as the "firing
squad," the "coup" was instigated by another member of management, often
a co-founder of the company.

VC Power
The impact of the VCs inputs on the company varies with the VCs power
with management. The VC has three sources of power in the relationship—
money, personal relationships, and formal power.
Money
The ability to allocate money has long been viewed as a major source of
power in large organizations. Not surprisingly, it is also a major source of power
in smaller businesses. Some refer to it as the golden rule: "He who has the gold
makes the rules." This power is not based upon money invested in the past, but
rather on company's current or future needs for money.
This power is often present in venture investments because investments
are generally made in stages based on the company's development. As a result, a
venture-backed start-up is almost certain to need additional funding to survive.
The company's existing venture investors are its most likely source of funding.

<-----Page 5----->The Venture Capitalist A Relationship Investor

particularly since finding new investors is more difficult when the old investors
are not willing to invest more.
This power is strongest when the venture is performing poorly and is
weakest when the company is performing well. With good performance, the
company usually has less need for outside funds, and the external funds that
are needed will be more available because it is an attractive investment.

Personal Relationships
The power of personal relationships is exemplified by the following comments, the first from a venture capitalist and the next two from managers:
"It's really the personal relationship that you develop with the guy running the
company and his team and the other directors. [You have influence] if they conclude that you are an interesting person committed to the success of the company,
that you're going to work hard at it, that you're not going to try to run it, that
you're going to be very open, and that you think clearly and communicate clearly
and are just a valuable person to have around."
"Especially with our lead [VC], who has been the most active, it's been 5'A years
of living through good times and bad times, and all the times in between. So you
certainly get that kind of warm feeling, if you will."
"We respect them as professionals who have a professional interest in what we're
doing as well as a financial interest. I don't just respect these people because they
have money and voting power. I would do business with them anytime."

This power of personal relationships results from the VCs individual
expertise and effort devoted to the company." While the general image of the
VC in the managers' minds is favorable, there are two major criticisms of some
VCs. Managers complain that these VCs either lack sufficient expertise to be of
help or fail to spend sufficient time with the company. In fact, VCs sometimes
express these same negative views of other VCs.
Not surprisingly, relationship power was kind of power preferred by the
VCs as it is more pleasant to use, infringes less on the manager, and can still be
very strong. In one case, the VC convinced a founder with a strong technical
background to voluntarily step down as CEO in favor of a more experienced
businessperson. This decision came at a time when the company was developing
ahead of plan and was extremely well-funded. Feeling that a change in leadership was necessary if the company was to successfully make the transition into
an operating company, the VC convinced the founder through a series of "late
dinners and heart-to-heart conversations" that the move was in the company's
best interest.
While relationship power is extremely useful and enjoyable to use, it is
also the most difficult power to attain, as is indicated by the following comment
of one VC:

106

CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW VOL 37, NO. 2 WINTER 1995

<-----Page 6----->The Venture Capitalist: A Relationship Investor

"What gives [me] the most influence is if the entrepreneur accepts me as a partner in this venture, and he respects my opinion, my industry knowledge, to the
point where he seeks out my advice. If I can position myself that way, I can work
very effectively with someone. That's not easy to do. Some entrepreneurs are very
close to the vest; they view us like they do commercial bankers, you know, as
necessary evils."

Formal Power
VCs have a great deal of formal power as well, frequently being in control
of the board.'^ Even if VCs do not have voting control, there are usually contractual rights giving them control in case the venture fails to perform. However,
formal power is often the least important of the three forms of VC power, especially for early stage VCs. Since later-stage investors often do not have money
power, formal power is more important to them.
VCs tend to avoid the use of formal power because it is highly confrontational, and managers may have some countervailing formal power as well. More
than one group of deposed managers has sued a venture capital backed company over their termination. In fact VCs are reluctant to aggressively use any
power, as is indicated in the comment of one VC:
"We never end conversations with my asking him [the CEO], 'Well what are you
going to do now?' because the only answer that makes sense is, 'Well, I'm going
to do what I decide to do when I decide to do it, and you'll probably find out
about it.' I don't run the company."
There are three reasons for this reluctance. First, the VC is highly dependent on the industry expertise and company-specific knowledge of management, as indicated in the following comments from managers:
"If we're not doing the job, they can vote us out. But they're not going to if there
is the slightest chance that we're going to make it succeed, because we probably
represent a better shot at it than anybody [else]."
"As a venture capitalist on the board of a company, you really cannot imagine
how little you actually know about this company that you've invested in. It's not
through your ineptitude. It's just that you're not there every day." [from a manager who had been a venture capitalist]
Second, the power of the VC is diffused. When several VCs are involved
in the venture's funding, formal power is generally shared by a group of VCs
rather than one individual VC.
Third, VCs want strong, capable management.'' They have no desire to
run a company. For example, both managers and VCs stress that strategy formation is a management function. Rather, the function of the VC in strategy formation is to serve as a sounding board for management. As one VC commented:
"The best strategies come from the operating management and may be refined in
discussions with board members. Venture capitalists invest in so many different

107

<-----Page 7----->The Venture Capitalist: A Relationship Investor

businesses, we can never know as much about the businesses as the guys we
invest in know about their particular business.... While we may have some
perspective on the issue that they don't have, they've got much more information
than we've got. I've always found that the best way to formulate strategy in a
company is for management to take a first crack at it. And then for us to play the
role of sounding board and critic and try to ask the right questions. Also, it seems
to me that if a strategy originates with management, the management will be
much more proprietary about it. I mean, this is their strategy. They created it, they
sold it—maybe with some changes, but essentially they were the fountainhead of
the strategy. Therefore they own the strategy and have a vested interest in making
it work. . . . Our job is to be a backseat driver, and if we take the wheel in our
hands, we have failed, I think, in the teaching and coaching and counseling and
wheedling process. . . . You know, we're sort of like mothers-in-law, I guess. We
kibitz all the time; that's what we're supposed to do."

The VC serves as a sounding board not just in strategy making, but in
dealing with significant operating issues as well. Many CEOs frequently contact
their VCs outside of regular board meetings simply because "they are very, very
helpful in bouncing off ideas."

Impact of theVC
How is the company's behavior infiuenced by the VC? This question is
hard to answer since the upper-level management process in a venture capitalbacked, entrepreneurial enterprise is extremely dynamic and interactive. As one
experienced VC told us:
"It turns out you do have influence, but you don't know when you're going to
have an influence. So it's a tremendous burden on you to be as thoughtful as you
can be and as open as you can be all the time, because you never know when the
guy's listening or when it's going to be important."
In spite of these limitations, one can identify some general ways in which
VCs clearly infiuence firm behavior. The most obvious is when the VC decides
who will make decisions for the company—i.e., who will manage it. As one
manager stated:
"You've got to keep convincing the investor [VC] that you are on the right track.
To the extent that you do, they'll keep providing the money until you get over
the hump, so to speak. To the extent that you don't, they'll either cease providing
money to the company or they'll continue providing it without you."
The firm's behavior is also infiuenced by the availability of VC money—
both the initial investment as well as the VCs willingness to make further
investments. In one case, the manager said his company was losing its technological leadership position because its VCs were unwillingly to adequately fund
the company. Another felt his company's marketing efforts were weak because
the VCs had always kept the company underfunded. On the other hand.

108

CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW VOL 37, NO. 2 WINTER 1995

<-----Page 8----->The Venture Capitalist: A Relationship Investor

another manager indicated that his company was able to expand rapidly because
of the VCs willingness to fund growth.
As a result of their general business knowledge and experience, VCs
develop what is referred to as a dominant logic (a set of common views on the
appropriate management processes a company should use as well as on appropriate strategies to be employed). They then attempt to induce companies to
follow this dominant logic '" As one manager told us:
"To sit on the board of a small growing company and help that company grow and
do so basically in a committee atmosphere—that being the board of directors—is
an exceedingly difficult task. It requires an unusual and somewhat eclectic skill
set, and the venture capitalist brings that skill set."
The VCs dominant logic has five primary components: formal planning,
profit orientation, organizational development, patience and focus.

Formal Planning
VCs expect companies to use some formal planning procedures. A
business plan is usually required before a venture is seriously considered for
initial investment. After the investment is made, the plan is generally updated
annually. Although formal planning is required, it is not an elaborate or timeconsuming task because of the relatively small size of the company.

Profit Orientation
The importance of a profit orientation is refiected in one VCs comments:
"I constantly pusb profitable growth. Many companies grow too fast and sacrifice
profitability. I question whether companies like that will ever develop the discipline necessary to be profitable."

Organizational Development
VCs are interested in organizational development centered around developing a complete, quality top-management team. This is accomplished by either
adding new management positions or replacing old managers. In most cases,
VCs are more interested in organizational development than are CEOs.
Patience
Many managers view their VCs as relatively patient investors. For
example:
"[The impact of VCs has been] a very positive one in the sense that they're very
patient. . . . They have not asked us to roll the dice and be overly risky and try
and turn it into a billion dollar success overnight."
One manager indicated that VCs allowed his company to focus more on
long-run issues than did the public market:

CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW

VOL 37, NO. 2

WINTER 1995

109

<-----Page 9----->The Venture Capitalist: A Relationship Investor

"If you were a small [public] company you'd be really scrambling for earnings.
As a young company you are invariably not going to hit plan, whether you are
public or private. [When that happens] they [the public investor] will go away
and never come back."

Focus
VCs force managers to focus on meeting their stated objectives and
directly limit the number of objectives the company is trying to achieve." This
VC dominant logic is a very significant VC input. Many VCs feel that the growth
of the industry in the 1980s forced the use of inexperienced VCs who did not
possess the dominant logic. In addition, there is concern from institutional
investors and managers that VCs are not as effective when they move into
industries that are radically different from their experience base. In other
words, their dominant logic may not hold in the new industry.
In addition, some very experienced VCs feel uncomfortable advising
large companies. They feel that their dominant logic holds on small, highgrowth firms but not on larger firms. As a result, they are concerned that their
presence might actually hurt a more mature company and they leave the board
when a company gets too mature. As one of these VCs commented:
"My views are largely predictable as far as the direction of tighter focus and
tighter commitment to objectives, as opposed to running off in 93 different directions just so we can say we are doing a lot of things. . . . It's a general predilection
that I have which has been enormously helpful to me in start-up companies and
in small companies that are growing rapidly, but is something of a burden and a
disadvantage when companies are moving into the more mature stage."
Although not an issue in any of the cases we studied, there is potential
for confiict between the goals of the VC and those of the firm. The VC must ultimately make money on his/her investment in the firm. This requires that the VC
"exit" the investment, i.e., convert it to cash or marketable securities, thereby
becoming liquid in order to either invest in new deals or distribute returns to
the VCs limited partners. This is usually achieved by the firm going public, being
acquired, or being recapitalized. However, the best time for the VC to exit may
not coincide with the best time for the firm to undertake one of these
transactions.

Implications for Large Public Companies
Since the VC has historically operated in a small firm environment, often
with an emphasis on very new ventures, it is reasonable to question the relevance of the VC style to the governance of a large, more mature company. In
the existing American system, equity for large companies is generally provided
by impersonal capital markets. Thus the director does not provide a major VC

I 10

CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW VOL 37, NO. 2 WINTER 1995

<-----Page 10----->The Venture Capitalist: A Relationship Investor

input—namely, cash. This also deprives the director of a major source of power
over management—namely, money.
Other VC inputs may not be particularly important to a more mature firm
since the firm already possesses them. Even in VC settings, the significance of
the VCs operating service assistance declines drastically as the firm grows out
of infancy.'* The significance of the VCs image and networks also decreases.
However, the role of Warren Buffett at Salomon Brothers shows that even a
mature firm may benefit from the image of an active director.
Some of the inputs the VC provides are significant no matter what the
size or age of a firm, and the director of a large public company should provide
them as well. Discipline is one such input. Some of the most successful managers
of VC-backed firms view the discipline provided by the VC as vital. As one CEO
simply told us, "Everybody needs a boss."
Like the VC, directors of large public companies can also provide moral
support to their top management. It can be lonely at the top of an organization
—large or small. The director can serve as a potential confidante outside the
organization with whom top management can share major problems.
While the dominant logic needed by the director of a large company may
differ from that needed by a small company, companies of all sizes benefit when
directors possess strong general business knowledge and experience. Many of
the most successful and experienced managers of VC-backed companies are the
most enthusiastic in extolling the value of having "a good VC with a lot of business experience" to serve as a sounding board for top management.
Finally, while the VC may provide a model for large company directors
desirous of taking a more active role, all directors must realize that ultimately
they are dependent on management. One highly successful VC summed up his
experiences:
"What I've found in the past is looking back, after 10 years or so, when somebody
asks the entrepreneur, 'Was I ever helpful?' and then asks me the same thing,
generally I will have one or two incidents where I think, 'Boy, it was probably
important that I was around at that time because I had strong views on this or
that and either something got done or something got not done that I thought was
important.' But the guy that's running the company always has a different view.
'Oh yes, he was enormously valuable.' And then they say, 'When? What can you
really tell me?' And then they'll start talking about some incidents that I can
barely remember, and they'll describe these things in detail. And I can hardly
remember these things. All of which tells you who's most important in this scenario—the guy running the place."

APPENDIX
We followed the methodology outlined by Eisenhardt for building theories from case study research.'^ Six VCs were interviewed from each of three
regions—Silicon Valley, Boston, and the Southwest—all regions of important
venture capital activity. Based upon the suggestions of industry experts, VCs
were selected in each region so as to get a good cross-section of VCs. The
amount of funds under management varied from 4 to 450 million dollars.
Each VC was asked to describe their role in a company they had financed.
Fourteen of the VCs were willing to let us contact a company manager, generally
the CEO. All fourteen companies were willing to participate in the study.
The primary source of data was personal interviews with each of the VCs
and managers. All the interviews were confidential. Written documents (e.g.,
annual reports, business plans) were also examined to gain a richer understanding of the company and its history.
Theory was developed from these cases through a highly iterative process.
Cross-case comparisons were made to develop hypotheses. The hypotheses were
then tested against each case using a replication logic. Hypotheses were refined
and new hypotheses developed based upon these tests. As they were developed
and tested against the cases, these hypotheses were also examined in light of
existing literature. Finally earlier versions of this paper were shown to participants, and others familiar with the relationship, and their comments solicited.
