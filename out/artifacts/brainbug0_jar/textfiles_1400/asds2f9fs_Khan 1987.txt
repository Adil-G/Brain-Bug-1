This article examines the prospect of a decision support system for the
assessment of venture capital investments. It approaches the task of developing decision models from the perspective of the venture capitalist.
Thus venture capitalists have played an active role in dejim’ng the predictor
variables and in providing data on their own investments. Venture capitalists (and recent research) underscore the importance of the entrepreneur
in new ventures and the predictor variables selected reflect this bias.
The literature is now replete with studies demonstrating the superiority of multiattribute actuarial
models ov’er human judgment for diverse decision environments, ranging from medical science to
finance. This class of behavioral decision models consists of the simultaneous consideration of several
attributes relevant to a decision. Actuarial models of this kind can be applied to attribute and decision
data based on the decision maker’s judgments (i.e., expected outcomes) before the events transpiretermed judgment-based models. They can also be applied to data on past events or actual outcomes
where known-termed
environment-based models. Again, it needs to be emphasized that actuarial
models, whether based on the decision maker’s judgments or on the environment, usually outperform
the decision maker. These general principles are applied here.
Among actuarial models a particular subclass of models is called noncompensatory. In these
models, a low value for one attribute cannot be compensated by a high value for another attribute.
As an e.:zmple, in selecting a place-kicker in football, athletic skills other than kicking ability are
irrelevant.
In this study, two types of noncompensatory actuarial models, conjunctive and disjunctive, are
used to model both venture capitalists’ judgments and the environment. Interviews with venture
capitalists reveal that some place strong emphasis on one or two attributes in judging a potential
investment. This type of decision-making behavior indicates a disjunctive decision process. At the
same time, there can be a tendency to ensure that a prospective investment is satisfactory at a minimum

level of each attribute, which implies a conjunctive decision process, To summarize then, conjunctive
and disjunctive types of models are developed for both judgment-based and environment-based data.
A questionnaire was administered to reasonably active venture capitalists. The respondents
provided information on predictor variables, on expected investment outcomes at the time the investments were made, and on actual outcomes where known. The expected outcome data represent the
judgments of the venture capitalists, while the actual outcome data represent the decision environment.
The results showed that conjunctive models were generally superior predictors to disjunctive
models. Both types of models provided a reasonable jfit to the data, however, and this was true for
both judgment-based as well as environment-based applications. All the models performed better than
the venture capitalists’ judgments. In fact the latter turned out to be surprisingly poor predictors of
actual outcomes. Consequently, the judgment-based conjunctive and disjunctive models were not much
better.
However, the environment-based conjunctive and disjunctive models were far more successful
predictors. With a correlation of 0.70 against actual outcomes in the best case, they clearly demonstrated the potential of such decision aids. The direct implications are that support systems to aid
venture capital investment decisions are entirely feasible.
The contrasting performance of the judgment-based and environment-based models was analyzed
further. It revealed that venture capitalists. in arriving at their judgments, emphasized the entrepreneur’s desire for success and the nature of the product. On the other hand, the most important variable,
by far* in the successful environment-based model, was the creativitylingenuity of the entrepreneur.

INTRODUCTION
Drawing on earlier work, Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) have described the venture capital
investment process. They have also presented a descriptive model, which is an indicator of
investments likely to be funded by venture capitalists. The research presented here focuses
on predictive models based on the venture capitalist’s perspective that attempt to identify
successful venture capital investments.
As reported by Tyebjee and Bruno, the process of investing venture capital consists
of five steps: The first step is deal origination where intermediaries can play an important
role. The second step is a broad screening to limit serious investigation to investments in
fields familiar to the venture capitalist. The next step is evaluation. Since most ventures
have limited or no operating history, their assessment tends to be weighted towards the
subjective. The evaluation step is also the focus of this paper. The fourth step consists of
deal structuring. Given that a particular venture is acceptable, the venture capitalist and the
entrepreneur have to agree on the terms of the venture capital investment. Finally, the last
step deals with postinvestment
activities. These can vary from a passive role to actual
involvement
in operations. Most commonly,
it involves representation
on the board of
directors. In fact closer contact can often be a result of operational problems. And in the
most extreme case a venture capitalist may be forced to install a new management team.
To the question as to how a venture capitalist assesses a prospective investment, first
and foremost he looks at the management of the soliciting company. Other factors include
marketability of the product, competition from established firms, technical feasibility, even
the venture capitalist’s experience in the particular industry involved. It is not unusual for
a venture capitalist to turn down an application because he has no knowledge or experience
of that industry. Some firms emphasize the marketing risk on the basis that the product has
to sell. However, most venture capitalists appear to return to the importance of management
and the quality of the entrepreneur (Hines, undated pamphlet); an assertion that is confirmed
by MacMillan et al. (1985).

David McClelland’s (1962, 1965) work in this area hypothesizes that entrepreneurship
can be ascertained by measuring achievement motivation. He also points to an inverse
relationship with dependency need, which is characterized by French (1966) as a need for
interpersonal warmth and support. However, McClelland defines entrepreneurship very broadly
as business activity, and it includes, for example, the work done by an officer of a large
firm.
Lachman (1980) confirms achievement motivation as a positive indicator of entreprenural behavior, but he finds no relationship between dependency needs and entrepreneurship. Sexton and Bowman (1985), however, find that an entrepreneur has “a lower need
for support than his or her corporate counterpart” (p. 138).
Palmer (1971) states that results of extensive research in achievement motivation
indicate that people who score high on achievement motivation tests are likely to end up in
the business world. However, French (1956) earlier found no correlations between achievement motivation and organizational skill. Other studies by Winterbottom (1958) and Rosen
and D’Andrade (1959) explore the sources of achievement motivation, and they conclude
that the seeds are laid in childhood.
The crucial questions, however, remain unanswered: How does one differentiate between a successful and an unsuccessful entrepreneur? And more importantly, how does one
differentiate between successful and unsuccessful investments? Probing these issues further
with venture capitalists, they tend to express their overall judgment as a “gut feel” for a
deal. The purpose of this research then is to provide an objective basis for this “gut feel.”
In other words, the venture capitalists provide major input in the selection of variables and
the models are developed from their perspective.

DECISION MODELS
It is significant that the venture capitalist’s “gut feel” is based on a heavy bias towards one
or two factors. As mentioned before, most emphasize the assessment of the entreprene*n.
Such a judgmental process confirms Payne’s findings (1976) that in a complex decision
problem, the human decision maker resorts to cognitive strain-reducing strategies. His study
confirmed the fact that human beings have definite cognitive limitations, particularly in
processing multidimensional
nonsensory data. They deliberately simplify what may be complex to reduce the problem to a size that they can handle.
Judgments of decision makers have been modeled, for diverse judgmental tasks, by
means of actuarial models. The success of these models has been astonishing, for when a
criterion or “true” judgment has been available for comparison, the models have performed
better than the decision makers themselves. This phenomenon has been termed “bootstrapping,” namely, the existence of the condition whereby the model outpredicts the decision
maker. The “lens model” (Brunswik 1952; Hammond 1955) provides a conceptualization:
the environment separated, by time or space, from the decision maker’s judgment is viewed
through a lens (comprised of decision cues) in arriving at the judgment. Models can be
developed to relate the cues to the environment (actual event); and models can also relate
the cues to judgment.
Studies using actuarial models have embraced a wide range of decision-making
activities. Some examples: Slavic (1969) modeled decisions assessing attractiveness of common
stocks. Dawes (1971) studied judgments on graduate admissions. Hoffman, Slavic, and
Rorer (1968), Goldberg (1970), and Einhorn (1972) looked at clinical judgments in the
medical field. Ashton (1974) and Joyce (1976) studied internal control judgments, in auditing,

<-----Page 3----->196

made by public accountants.
Owens and Henry (1966) employed biographical data as a
predictor of occupational success. Einhorn and McCoach (1977) aggregated subjective utility
values of several attributes as a selection criterion and Khan and Shih (1985) looked at
country risk for international investments.
The bootstrapping reported was explained originally as due to the consistency and
reliability of the model (Goldberg 1970). Others (Dawes and Corrigan 1974) have indicated,
however, that the phenomenon might well be a characteristic of the actuarial model itself.
While the weight of evidence is in favor of bootstrapping, Chakravarti, Mitchell, and
Staelin (1979) report that, in a laboratory study, a group of executives using a judgment
model developed by Little ( 1970) performed no better than an unaided control group. The
failure has been attributed to bias in human judgment and to nonstationarity of the response
function because of carryover effects. When these two factors are kept in check, however,
judgment models continue to be successful (McIntyre 1982).
Given the superiority of the model and the limitations of the human in processing
multidimensional
information, the role of the decision maker is more appropriate in identifying, measuring, and scaling the predictor variables for the model. The aggregation of
this information and the final decision is provided by the model. This is the basis for
man-machine
systems to aid decision making. The objective is to use humans for what they
do best, and machines for what they do best. Thus, humans provide the priors and the
machine do the aggregation.
Edwards (1962) used precisely this principle when he introduced the idea of a probabilistic information-processing
(PIP) system. Here humans provided the initial probabilistic
data and computers developed the aggregated Bayesian posterior probabilities. Einhom, in
his 1972 paper, “Expert Measurement and Mechanical Combination,”
employs experts (in
his study, clinical pathologists) to identify and scale the predictor variables. He then models
the experts’ judgments of the predictors together with the actual outcomes. And his models
significantly outperform the experts. Here again, the experts and the model complement
each other, both doing what they do best-the
experts identifying the relevant predictors
and the model aggregating the information to provide a decision.
As mentioned earlier, most venture capitalists tend to emphasize one or two factors
in assessing an investment. Further discussions reveal that a few also tend to apply a certain
minimum requirement for major characteristics. These two types of decision-making behavior
can be described by disjunctive and conjunctive models.

The Conjunctive Model
A conjunctive formulation of the venture selection process requires that an acceptable venture
surpass a certain minimum level of each salient attribute. Dawes (1964) calls this a minimum
evaluation function. Such a decision process implies a noncompensatory
procedure, for if
the cutoff value is not met on any one attribute, the venture is rejected; that is, the lack of
a particular attribute cannot be compensated by a surfeit of another.
Einhom (1970) presents a functional approximation for the conjunctive model. Extended to n variables the formulation is

type of response surface ensures that Y is larger for values of Xi that are
the same, as opposed to values of Xi that are markedly different.

The Disjunctive Model
A disjunctive formulation of the venture selection process requires that an acceptable venture
surpass a sufficiently high level of one attribute. These high levels for the attributes form a
maximum evaluation function. In personnel selection, for example, such a function represents
specialization and the search for specialists.
An algebraic approximation for the disjunctive model (Einhom 1970) for n variables
can be written,

where co is a constant set above the largest Xi value to ensure Y will not be infinite. The
hyperbolic type of response surface means that a high value of Y is obtained for a high value
of just one Xi even though the scores for the other X,‘s may be low.

VARIABLE SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION
As noted earlier, a survey of relevant literature helped to identify entrepreneur characteristics.
In addition, interviews with a sample of prominent venture capitalists served to consolidate
the selection of predictor variables. These selected variables are the entrepreneur’s Desire
for Success (X1), Creativity/Ingenuity
(X2), Tenacity/Courage
(X3), Enthusiasm/Capacity
for Work (X4), Competence in Field of Endeavor (X5), and lastly, Uniqueness of Product
or Service Relative to Competition (X6).
The criterion or dependent variables are Expected Outcome (Y,) and Actual Outcome
(Y,). The expected outcome is the outcome anticipated by the venture capitalist at the time
the venture is (or was) initiated). It therefore represents the venture capitalist’s judgment of
the investment when made. The actual outcome represents what actually happened to the
investment.
The venture capitalist’s interpretation and rationale for the predictor variables is as
follows:
The entrepreneur’s desire for success (Xi) is synonymous with the will to win. It is
also intermingled with a desire to make money because in business money often serves as
a barometer of success.
Creativity and ingenuity (X2) represent the ability to be innovative, which in turn
implies not just invention but the resourcefulness
and ingenuity to market that invention
successfully. Creative entrepreneurs have the resourcefulness
to invent, improve, or repackage products in a way, and at a price, that makes them attractive to consumers.

<-----Page 5----->198

Tenacity and courage (X,) are personality traits that help the entrepreneur overcome
the myriad problems expected to plague new ventures. These qualities embrace a toughness
that enables a person to continue forging ahead in circumstances where many might quit.
Enthusiasm and capacity for work (X,) represent, to a great extent, what Sexton and
Bowman (1985) describe as “energy level.” Not only does it help in meeting the demands
of a new business, but it serves as a motivator for subordinates. While these variables appear
difficult to measure, the venture capitalist’s reputation for shrewdness is not without merit!
One venture capitalist said that if he gets interested in a deal he calls the entrepreneur and
suggests a 6:30 a.m. breakfast meeting. Any hesitation at the other end of the line is a
negative signal.
Competence in field of endeavor (X,) is perceived as reducing the risk level. From
the venture capitalist’s point of view the entrepreneur who has previously been successful
in a venture is a good bet. Sahlman and Stevenson (1985) note, for example, that finding
equity capital for startups in the early days of the Winchester disk drive industry was relatively
easy. Among the reasons why, they observe, “The entrepreneurs were extremely well qualified. Some
. had already been involved with successful ventures. Others . . had top
executives who cumulatively had over 100 years of disk drive industry experience” (p. 19).
Uniqueness of Product or Service (X,): Most venture capitalists consider product
relatively unimportant,
as long as it provides some new “twist” that generates consumer
interest. The variable is included to test this contention.

DATA COLLECTION
As venture capital firms are generally private and jealously guard their financial data, a
measure of anonymity had to be assured to obtain their cooperation. Thus data forms were
coded to ensure confidentiality.
The predictor variables were scaled from 1 to 5 (1, poor;
2, below average; 3, average; 4, above average; and 5, excellent) and the criterion variables
were scaled from 1 to 6 (I, wipeout; 2, loss; 3, below average profit; 4, average profit; 5,
above average profit; and 6, real winner). The scale descriptions were provided to ensure
consistency.
On the basis of recent investment activity (at least two investments in the past year),
a sample of venture capital firms was selected from A Guide to Venture Capital Sources
published originally by Capital Publishing Corporation and now by Venture Economics.
The respondents provided information on predictor variables as well as expected outcomes
and actual outcomes (where known) for each investment. The investment had to be categorized as startups or nonstartups, that is later stage financings. A total of 36 responses
yielded data on 104 investments. In all, there were 68 investments where actual final outcomes
were known, and of these, 35 were startups and 33 second stage or later financings.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Conjunctive and disjunctive noncompensatory
models are constructed first for data where
expected outcomes are the decision criterion. Thus the dependent variable is the expected
outcome (Y,) and the independent variables are X, through Xb. As the expected outcomes
of ventures represent the judgments of venture capitalists, these models, in both conjunctive
and disjunctive form, are also termed judgment-based
models.
The second set of models, again in conjunctive and disjunctive form, are based on
the actual outcomes of ventures. As these are actual events, these models are termed en-

Models

For these models the data are segregated into two cases: In the first case actual outcomes
are not known, and therefore the judgments are pure, in the sense that the data have not
been or could not have been influenced by knowledge of actual outcomes-this
possible
influence is discussed later. The second case represents “look-back” judgments because
actual outcomes are known.
The R2 (coefficient of determination) values for the first case models are presented in
Table 1. The conjunctive model provides an excellent fit with an R2 of 0.90 and an F value
of 43.58. It is conclusive evidence that the judgments of venture capitalists can be modeled
successfully. The disjunctive model is not a bad fit with an R* of 0.5 1, but it suffers from
model coefficients that are not significant.
Table 2 shows R* values for the second case, namely, where outcomes are known.
The data here were sufficient to develop separate models for start-up financings and nonstartup financings; an overall model is also included. Here the performance of the disjunctive
model is marginally superior to the conjunctive. However, neither model type displays the
spectacular fit of the conjunctive model (Table 1) with unknown actual outcomes.

Predictor Variable Coefficients in the Judgment-Based

Models

To gain some insight into the venture capitalists’ decision process, one can examine the
coefficients of the predictor variables in the judgment models. The data set where actual
outcomes are not yet known to the venture capitalists avoids any possibility of judgment
contamination.
And the conjunctive model type is considered first because of its superior
performance.
Table 3 presents the variable coefficients and significance levels. As all independent
variables are measured on the same scale, a direct comparison of the coefficients gauges
the relative importance of the variables to the venture capitalists. It is clear from Table 3
that XI, the entrepreneur’s desire for success, is considered most important, followed there-

after by Xb, the product variable. Both these variables also happen to be highly significant
statistically.
While desire for success was often mentioned by venture capitalists as almost a prerequisite to successful entrepreneurship,
product was equally often decried, other than at a
minimal level of a new “twist” that can generate market interest. Yet the model of venture
capitalists’ judgments shows very clearly that significant importance is attached to it. Product
then appears to be an intuitive filter, given much more credence by venture capitalists than
they themselves appear to realize.
A stepwise regression procedure with the conjunctive model confirms these findings:
Thus X, accounts for 72% of the variance and 80% of the total RZ, and, X, and X6 taken
together account for 87% of the variance, which is almost 97% of the total R2.
The disjunctive model for the same case has only one significant variable (Table 4)
and that too at a modest .08 level. This happens to be the product variable X6, which again
serves to underscore its validity in the mindset of the venture capitalists.

Data Verification
Venture capitalists had been asked to rate expected outcomes for their investments. In 36
investments the final outcomes were not known; in 68 investments the final outcomes were
known so that in rating expected outcomes the respondents were looking back to when they
originally made the investment.
In the latter case, it can be argued that a respondent’s
assessments of expected outcomes could have been tainted by knowledge of actual outcomes.
Furthermore, the possibility exists that contact with the entrepreneur over a prolonged period

might so change the venture capitalist’s perception that it might be difficult for him to
recreate the original evaluation.
To test the data for this type of bias the expected outcome or judgment-based
models
developed for the two kinds of data (Table 1 and overall data in Table 2) are used to predict
the outcomes of all 104 investments. The conjunctive model type is selected because it is
markedly superior for the case where actual final outcomes are not known (Table 1) and not
substantially different where final outcomes are known (Table 2, Overall data).
If the assessments of expected outcomes a priori and ex post are substantially different,
the two conjunctive models will be different, and their predictions will also be different.
Instead, the correlation between the 104 predicted values obtained from the two models is
found to be 0.952, which suggests an absence of bias. It also points to a shrewd realism
that enables venture capitalists to reproduce original decisions without being affected by
later events.

Environment-Based

Models

The next step is to develop environment-based
models. The data (ventures) considered here
are the same as for the models in Table 2 except that now the dependent variable represents
the actual outcomes of the ventures as opposed to the venture capitalists’ prior judgments
of them. As before, these actual outcome or environment-based
models are constructed for
start-up, nonstart-up, and overall data.
Table 5 shows the performance of these models and in each case the conjunctive model
is superior. The failure of the disjunctive model in the nonstartup case can be attributed to
the inability of such a model, with its emphasis on a single variable, to absorb all the useful
information about the other variables that becomes available in later stage financings.

Predictor Variable Coefficients in the Environment-Based

Models

The variable coefficients for the conjunctive model with overall data are shown in Table 6.
Since the predictor variables are all measured on the same scale, these coefficients can be
compared directly with each other to assess variable importance.
The highest weighted variable in this model is the entrepreneur’s creativity/ingenuity
X,. This variable is also the most significant. It is interesting to note that in analyzing the
coefficients of the judgment-based
models earlier, desire for success X1 and product Xb
carried the highest weights (Table 3). Both these variables have negative coefficients in the
environment-based
model, with the coefficient of X, being significant at the .05 level.
A stepwise regression procedure for the different environment-based conjunctive models
shows that X2 accounts for 71% of the total R2 in the start-up case and 59% for overall data.
In contrast, the most important variable in the judgment-based
model discussed earlier is
desire for success X,, and it alone accounts for 80% of model R’.

The variable coefficients for the environment-based
disjunctive model are shown in
Table 7. Again XZ carries the highest weighting and it is quite significant at the .04 level.
And again the coefficients of X, and X6 carry a reversal of sign as in the conjunctive
formulation, so that the earlier findings are reinforced.
The insignificance of the product variable might at first sight appear to be contrary to
the results of the recent MacMillan et al. (1987) study. However, their significant product
variable was “demonstrated market acceptance for product,” whereas the variable used here
is different and represents the “uniqueness of product or service.” In addition, the dependent
variables also differ.
The comparison between the judgment-based
and environment-based
models makes
it quite clear tnat there are striking differences in variable significance and importance between
the two. The judgment-based
model, serving as a proxy for the venture capitalist, emphasizes
desire for success X1, and to a lesser extent product X 6; the environment-based
model
emphasizes the entrepreneur’s creativity/ingenuity
X2. The question is, which one is correct?
The next section on model performance attempts to answer this question.

Performance
Table 8 summarizes the correlations of the venture capitalists’ judgments as well as the
different models against actual outcomes. Somewhat surprisingly, there is almost no correlation between the judgments of the venture capitalists, represented by expected outcomes,
and the actual outcomes (first column). Consequently, the models based on these judgments
also exhibit small correlations with actual outcomes. Consistent with other studies, however,

the models confirm bootstrapping, for their correlations with actual outcomes, such as they
are, do represent an improvement over the judgments themselves.
The correlations for the environment-based
models versus actual outcomes given in
the fourth and fifth columns are merely the square roots of the values given in Table 5. The
correlations here are substantially better than with the judgment-based
models, so that the
environment-based
models appear to offer a fruitful basis for a decision support system for
venture capitalists.
Given the very different performance of the judgment-based
and environment-based
models, their strikingly dissimilar specifications ascertained previously are no longer surprising. The unsuccessful judgment-based
models show that the venture capitalist in general
stresses desire for success and product. On the other hand, the successful environment-based
models emphasize the creativity and ingenuity of the entrepreneur. Therefore the successful
venture capitalist in all likelihood does the same.

Intercorrelations of Predictor Variables
In assessing predictive models, an important issue is the intercorrelation of predictor variables. A major problem of this nature can damage the predictive power of a model, and in
this study, the salient variables identified by the experts gave cause for concern. The highest
intercorrelations observed were .61 between desire for success XI and tenacity/courage X3,
and .60 between X3 and enthusiasm/capacity
for work X4. It is of interest then to investigate
models without X3. These reveal very little shrinkage (Table 9), and it would appear that

SUMMARY
This study has demonstrated the potential for decision aids in evaluating new ventures. It
has first presented predictive judgment-based
models that reflect the viewpoint of the venture
capitalist. The high correlations of these models indicate that the judgment process of a
venture capitalist can be modeled successfully. Unfortunately, the judgments on which these
models had been based appear to be poorly correlated with actual outcomes. Consequently,
these models do not predict the actual outcomes of ventures very well. However, environment-based models (i.e., based on actual outcomes) are also shown to be possible. These
offer a better potential as predictors and among them the conjunctive model performs best.
Further analysis of the environment-based
models reveals the tremendous importance
of the creativity/ingenuity
variable. In contrast the poorly performing judgment-based models
emphasize the entrepreneur’s desire for success and the nature of the product. Thus it appears
that the venture capitalist must exercise particular scrutiny on the entrepreneur’s potential
for creativity and ingenuity. And given the predictive importance of this variable, future
research might consider disaggregation,
to evaluate creativity and ingenuity as a broad
spectrum varying from pure creativity at one end to shrewdness at the other.
Venture capitalists receive several hundred proposals each year out of which the number
funded can usually be counted on the fingers of one hand. For the practitioner, then, the
results of this study open up the possibility of an early filtering device. Application is not
cumbersome. Given model coefficients, it consists of variable assessments and simple computation. Moreover later evaluations, when more is known about the entrepreneur, can serve
to confirm the selection of an investment receiving further consideration.
