INTRODUCTION

Organizational Survival

SOCIAL and economic activities, such as religion, entertainment, education, research, and the production of other goods and services, are carried
on by different types of organizations, for example, corporations, proprietorships, partnerships, mutuals, and nonprofits. Most goods and services
can be produced by any form of organization, and there is competition
among organizational forms for survival in any activity. Absent fiat, the
form of organization that survives in an activity is the one that delivers the
product demanded by customers at the lowest price while covering costs.
This is the telling dimension on which the economic environment chooses
among organizational forms.
An important factor in the survival of organizational forms is control of
agency problems. Agency problems arise because contracts are not costlessly written and enforced. Agency costs include the costs of structuring,
monitoring, and bonding a set of contracts among agents with conflicting
interests, plus the residual loss incurred because the cost of full enforcement of contracts exceeds the benefits.1 In this paper we explain the

special features of the residual claims of different organizational forms as
efficient approaches to controlling special agency problems. We analyze
only private organizations. In related papers we examine other features of
the contract structures of different organizational forms that contribute to
their survival; in particular, (1) the control of agency problems in the class
of organizations characterized by separation of "ownership" and "control," and (2) the effects of special characteristics of residual claims on
decision rules for resource allocation.2
B.

Residual Claims: General Discussion

The contract structures of organizations limit the risks undertaken by
most agents by specifying either fixed payoffs or incentive payoffs tied to
specific measures of performance. The residual risk-the risk of the difference between stochastic inflows of resources and promised payments
to agents-is borne by those who contract for the rights to net cash flows.
We call these agents the residual claimants or residual risk bearers.
The characteristics of residual claims distinguish organizations from
one another and help explain the survival of organizational forms in
specific activities. We first analyze and contrast the relatively unrestricted
residual claims of open corporations with the restricted residual claims of
proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations. We then turn to
the more specialized residual claims of professional partnerships,
financial mutuals, and nonprofits.
II.

OPEN CORPORATIONS

Most large nonfinancial organizations are open corporations. The common stock residual claims of such organizations are unrestricted in the
sense that (1) stockholders are not required to have any other role in
the organization, (2) their residual claims are freely alienable, and (3) the
residual claims are rights in net cash flows for the life of the organization.
Because of the unrestricted nature of the residual claims of open corporations, there is generally almost complete separation and specialization of
decision functions and residual risk bearing.
A.

Common Stock versus State Contingent Claims

One can imagine claims that are even less restricted than the common
stocks of open corporations. There could be "state contingent claims"2
Eugene F. Fama & Michael C. Jensen, Separation of Ownership and Control, in this
issue. See also Eugene F. Fama & Michael C. Jensen, Organizational Forms and Investment
Decisions (Working Paper No. MERC 83-03, Univ. Rochester, Managerial Economics Research Center 1983).

329

that is, claims of the sort discussed by Arrow and Debreu3 specifying
payoffs for each possible future state of the world. Such state contingent
claims allow any (hence generally "less restricted") allocation of risk.
They are, nonetheless, fixed payoff promises. To specify the total payoffs
to be obtained in all future states, one would need to identify all current
and future decisions of an organizationthrough state contingent claim
contracts. Given the costs and informationrequirementsthis implies, it is
not surprisingthat state contingentclaims are not the dominantsystem for
allocatingrisk.
We can also imagine state contingent claims that are true residual
claims. The claim would cover a fraction of the organization'snet cash
flows in a given state ratherthan a specifiedpayoff in that state. However,
this type of claim generates conflicts amongthe claim holdersof different
states because alternativedecisions shift payoffs across states and benefit
some claim holders at the expense of others. Common stock that represents proportionateclaims on the payoffs of all future states eliminates
these agency problems, but at the sacrifice of some efficiency in the
allocation of risk. Common stock and other common forms of residual
claims also avoid most of the costs of definingand verifyingstates of the
world.
B. The Advantages of Common Stock Residual Claims
1. UnrestrictedRisk Sharing among Residual Claimants. The common stock of open corporationsallows more efficient risk sharingthan
residual claims that are not separable from decision roles, as, for example, in proprietorshipsand partnershipswhere the proprietors and
partners are the decision makers and the primary residual claimants.
Common stock allows residual risk to be spread across many residual
claimantswho individuallychoose the extent to which they bear risk and
who can diversify across organizationsofferingsuch claims. Otherthings
equal, portfolio theory implies that such unrestrictedrisk sharinglowers
the cost of risk-bearingservices.4
2. SpecializedRiskBearing by ResidualClaimants. The activities of
large open nonfinancialcorporationsare typically complicated,involving
contractswith manyfactors of production,for example, differenttypes of
labor, raw materials, and managers. When there is significantvariation
throughtime in the probabilityof default on these contracts, contracting
costs increase. In addition,because the humancapitalof agents is gener3 Kenneth J. Arrow, The Role of Securities in the
Optimal Allocation of Risk Bearing, 31

ally employed in a single organization,risk aversion tends to cause them
to charge more for any risk they bear than security holders who can
diversify risk across many organizations.5
Efficient accommodationof large-scale specialized risk bearingby residual claimants is an advantage of corporate common stock. To bond
contractualpayments to other agents, the common stockholdersput up
wealth, which is used to purchase assets. If the wealth requiredto bond
promisedpayments goes beyond the value of inputs optimallypurchased
rather than rented, common stock proceeds can be used to purchase
liquidassets, for example, the securitiesof other organizations,that have
no function except to bond specialization of risk bearing by residual
claimants.
3. Purchase of Organization-specificAssets. Klein, Crawford,and
Alchianand Jensen and Mecklingarguethat because of conflicts of interest with outside owners of organization-specificassets-assets that have
lower value to other organizations-rental contractsfor such assets generate higher agency costs than outrightpurchase.6Commonstock, with
its capacity for raising wealth from residual claimants, is an efficient
vehicle for financing such purchases in activities where using large
amounts of organization-specificrisky assets is efficient.
4. Specialization of Management. In the complicated production
and distributionactivities of large open corporations, coordinatingthe
activities of agents, recontractingamong them, and initiatingand implementing resource allocation decisions are specialized tasks which are
importantto the survival of the organizationand largely fall on its managers. However, managerialskills are not necessarily tied to wealth or
willingness to bear risk, and incompetent managerswho are important
residualclaimantscan be difficultto remove. Thus, ignoringagency problems in the decision process, the survival of a complex organizationis
enhanced by common stock residual claims that allow specializationof
management-in effect, the absence of a classical entrepreneurwho is
both decision maker and residualrisk bearer.
5. The MarketValue Rulefor InvestmentDecisions. Whencommon
stocks are traded without transactionscosts in a perfectly competitive
capital market, the stockholdersagree that resource allocationdecisions

claimantsand for referencesto the relatedliterature.

shouldbe evaluatedaccordingto their contributionto the currentmarket
value of their residual claims.7 The market value rule weighs current
against future resources accordingto the opportunitycosts at which resources can be tradedacross time in the capitalmarket.For example, the
market value rule favors expendituresto reduce the currentand future
costs of delivering products whenever the current market value of the
futurecost savings is greaterthan the currentexpenditure.Productprices
can then be lowered while still covering costs.
In contrast, when the horizonof the residualclaims is less than the life
of the organization,residualclaimantsassign zero value to cash flows that
occur beyond the horizon.8Similarly,when residualclaims are not freely
alienableor separablefrom other roles in the organization,it is rational
for risk bearers to attributelower currentvalue to uncertaincash flows
than is implied by capital market prices for the future resources.9As a
consequence, ignoringagency problemsin the decision process, organizations with common stock residualclaims, investing accordingto the market value rule which is optimalfor their residualclaimants,will be able to
deliver products at lower prices than organizationswith restrictedresidual claims.
C. The Agency Problems of CommonStock Residual Claims
The unrestrictednature of the common stock residual claims of open
corporationsleads to an importantagency problem.The decision process
is in the hands of professionalmanagerswhose interests are not identical
to those of residualclaimants.This problemof separationof "ownership"
and "control"-more precisely, the separationof residual risk bearing
from decision functions-has troubled students of open corporations
from Adam Smith to Berle and Means and Jensen and Meckling.10In
"Separationof Ownershipand Control"H1we arguethatthis agency problem is controlledby decision systems that separatethe management(initiation and implementation)and control (ratificationand monitoring)of
importantdecisions at all levels of the organization.

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

Devices for separating decision management and decision control include (1) decision hierarchies in which the decision initiatives of lower
level agents are passed on to higher level agents, first for ratification and
then for monitoring, (2) boards of directors that ratify and monitor the
organization's most important decisions and hire, fire, and compensate
top-level decision managers, and (3) incentive structures that encourage
mutual monitoring among decision agents. The costs of such mechanisms
for separating decision management from decision control are part of the
price that open corporations pay for the benefits of unrestricted common
stock residual claims.
III.

UNRESTRICTED
RESTRICTED
VERSUS
RESIDUAL
CLAIMS

The proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations observed in
small-scale production activities differ in many ways both from one another and from open corporations. For example, proprietorships have a
single residual claimant, whereas partnerships and closed corporations
have multiple residual claimants. As a consequence, the residual claim
contracts in partnerships and closed corporations must specify rights in
net cash flows and procedures for transferring residual claims to new
agents more explicitly than the residual claims in proprietorships.
However, for control of the agency problems in the decision process,
the common characteristic of the residual claims of proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations that distinguishes them from open corporations is that the residual claims are largely restricted to important
decision agents. This restriction avoids the agency problems between
residual claimants and decision agents that arise because of separation of
risk-bearing and decision functions in open corporations. Thus, costly
mechanisms for separating the management and control of decisions are
avoided.12
Restricting residual claims to decision makers controls agency problems between residual claimants and decision agents, but at the expense
of the benefits of unrestricted common stock. The decision process suffers efficiency losses because decision agents must be chosen on the basis
of wealth and willingness to bear risk as well as for decision skills. Residual claimants forgo optimal diversification so that residual claims and
decision making can be combined in a small number of agents. Forgone
diversification and limited alienability lower the value of the residual
claims, raise the cost of risk-bearing services, and lead to less investment
12 However, in partnerships and closed corporations, some mechanisms for resolving
conflicts among residual claimant decision makers (for example, buy-out rules) are required.

333

in projects with uncertain payoffs than when residual claims are unrestricted. Finally, because decision agents have limitedwealth, restricting
residualclaims to them also limits resources availablefor bonding contractualpayoffs and for acquiringrisky organization-specificassets.
An organizationalform survives in an activity when the costs and
benefitsof its residualclaims and the approachesit providesto controlling
agencyproblems combine with availableproductiontechnology to allow
the organizationto deliver products at lower prices than other organizationalforms. The restricted residual claims of proprietorships,partnerships,and closed corporationsare more likely to dominatewhen technology does not involve important economies of scale that lead to large
demandsfor specialized decision skills, specialized risk bearing, and
wealthfrom residualclaimants. Inthese circumstances,the agency costs
saved by restricting residual claims to decision agents outweigh the
benefitsthat would be obtained from separation and specialization of
decisionand risk-bearingfunctions. On the other hand, unrestrictedcommonstock residual claims are more likely to dominate when there are
importanteconomies of scale in productionthat (i) can be realized only
witha complex decision hierarchythat makes useof specializeddecision
skillsthroughoutthe organization,(ii) generatelargeaggregaterisks to be
borneby residual claimants, and (iii) demand large amounts of wealth
fromresidualclaimantsto purchaserisky assets and to bond the payoffs
promisedto a wide range of agents in the organization. Insuch complex
organizationsthe benefits of unrestrictedcommon stock residual claims
arelikely to outweigh the costs of controllingthe agency problemsinherentin the separationand specializationof decision and risk-bearingfunctions. Inthese circumstances,the open corporationis more likely to win

THEJOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

A. ProfessionalPartnerships
Like the proprietorships,partnerships,and closed corporationsdiscussed above, the residual claims of the professional partnershipsobservedin law, public accounting, medicine, and business consultingare
restrictedto importantdecision agents. However, in professionalpartnerships,a partner'sshare in net cash flows is renegotiatedperiodically,and
hisrightsin net cash flows are often limitedto his periodof service in the
organization.In effect, a professionalpartner'sresidualclaimis a flexible
andinalienable share of net cash flows for a limited horizon. Flexible
sharingrules, inalienability,and limited horizons distinguishthe residual
claims of professional partnershipsfrom those of the proprietorships,
partnerships,and closed corporationsobserved in other activities. Moreover,these special featuresof professionalpartnershipresidualclaimsare
generallyretainedwhen these organizationsbecome professionalservice
corporationsfor tax purposes.

1. DecentralizedDecisionMakingand RestrictedResidualClaims.

Inprofessionalpartnerships,large and small, individualsor small teams
workon cases, audits, and so on. Because of the importanceof specific
knowledgeabout particularclients-knowledge that is costly to transfer
amongagents-it is efficient for the teams in large partnershipsto make
most decisions locally. Thus, with respect to the services rendered to
customers,decision control takes place within teams, where interaction
andmutualmonitoringare heaviest. At this level, however, decision management(initiationand implementation)and decision control (ratification
and monitoring)are not separate. To control the resultingagency problems, the residualclaims in professionalpartnershipsare restrictedto the
professionalagents who are the importantteam membersand who have
majordecision makingroles. This is consistent with the hypothesisdeveloped in "Separationof Ownershipand Control"14that combinationof
decisionmanagementand controlfunctionsin one or a few agentsleads to
restrictionof residual claims to the importantdecision agents.

public accountants, physicians, and some business consultants provide
services where one incompetentact can do largedamageto a client. As a
consequence, certificationand pedigree are importantto clients. Moreover, even in the largest professional service organizations,services are
renderedin individualcases by one or a few professionals.Responsibility
for variation in the quality of services is easily assigned to individual
agents, and the performanceof agents is often well known to clients. In
these circumstances, the value of human capital is sensitive to perfor14 Id.

mance. In effect, unlimitedliability is imposed on the humancapital of
professionalagents by the marketfor their services. This gives the professional incentives to purchase monitoring and consulting to help limit
losses in the value of human capital.
Since professional services are technical, a lawyer, physician, public
accountant, or business consultant is efficiently monitoredby others of
the same trainingwho can also providevaluableconsultingservices. Such
mutual monitoring and consulting are encouraged when professional
agents agree to pool net cash flows and to shareliabilityfor the actions of
colleagues. Pooling of net cash flows and liabilityis attractivebecause it
encourages mutual monitoring and consulting. Mutual monitoringand
consulting improve the quality of services delivered, control liability
losses, and enhancethe humancapitalof the partners.Poolingof net cash
flows and liability also has risk-sharingadvantages.
The analysis is robustto the fact that partnershipssometimespurchase
malpracticeinsurance.Insuranceeliminatesvariabilityof liabilitypayoffs
by substitutinga certain insurancepremium.However, if premiumsare
renegotiatedto reflect the malpracticeexperience of the insured, insurance does not destroy the professional'sincentives to be monitoredor to
consult with other professionals.15In addition,insurancecovers liability
to customers but not reductionsin the value of humancapital caused by
incompetentor malfeasantacts.
3. Large Professional Partnerships and Flexible Sharing Rules.
Some professionalpartnershipshave hundredsand sometimesthousands
of partners.Such large partnershipsprovideportfoliosof specialized services that are marketed and delivered over a wide geographicalarea.
They can also provide large bonds to protect clients against losses from
malfeasanceor incompetence.16Large partnershipsare also educational
organizations,offeringyoung professionalsa wide rangeof opportunities
and interactionwith otherprofessionals.We are more concerned,though,
with the effects of size on the contract structuresof these organizations
than with explainingwhy they are large.
Having attainedpartnerstatus, a professionalmay be temptedto freeride on the efforts of colleagues. The residualclaims of largepartnerships
take a direct approachto this agency problem. The residualclaim is not
generally a fixed share of net cash flows. Rather, a partner's share is
renegotiatedannuallyon the basis of past performanceand estimates of
likely contributionsto future net cash flows. In these large partnerships
15 David Mayers & Clifford W. Smith, Jr., On the Corporate Demand for Insurance, 55
J. Bus. 281 (1982), argue that insurance itself is a way to purchase monitoring.
16 See Linda DeAngelo, Auditor Size and Audit Quality, 3 J. Accounting & Econ. 183
(1981).

<-----Page 10----->336

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

service to a client is delivered by a small group of professionals who
interact and monitor one another intensively. The composition of the
teams changes from case to case to match specialized talents to specialized problems. As a result, the professionals develop knowledge of the
talents and contributions of a range of colleagues. Flexible sharing rules
add to partners' incentives to gather and communicate such knowledge to
the renegotiation process.
Given flexible sharing rules and the way payoffs are tied to performance, large professional partnerships can be viewed as associations of
proprietors who get together to obtain the benefits from marketing a portfolio of specialized skills both to clients and to young professionals who
purchase specialized education. Or, since the partners often work in small
teams that shift from case to case, a large partnership can be regarded as a
fluid association of small partnerships.
4. Limited Horizon Residual Claims. Limitations on the horizon
covered by residual claims cause organizations to bias decisions against
alternatives that generate net cash flows beyond the horizon. In "Organizational Forms and Investment Decisions" 17 we argue that the limited
horizon feature of the residual claims of professional partnerships reflects
the relative unimportance of assets that are not effectively capitalized in
the human capital of existing partners. There are generally no important
patents, specialized assets, or technologies to be passed from one generation of partners to the next. Each partner brings a depleting asset-human
capital-to the partnership. The annual readjustments of shares in net
cash flows that are typical, especially in large professional partnerships,
calibrate a partner's payoffs to reflect the current and expected future
contributions of his human capital. When a partner's human capital is
used up or withdrawn from the organization, contributions to net cash
flows cease, and this is reflected in the termination, without substantial
compensation, of his residual claim.
This explanation of the limited horizon feature of the residual claims of
professional partnerships gets support from several sources:
1. Professional human capital serves as a bond against malfeasance
when its value is sensitive to performance. However, professional human
capital cannot be sold to cover liability losses to customers. To satisfy the
demand for reimbursement for such losses and to bond their services
further, partners generally extend their liability to tangible assets held
outside the organization (that is, they contract for unlimited liability), or
they purchase insurance against liability losses to clients. Such use of
17 Fama & Jensen, supra note 2.

<-----Page 11----->AGENCYPROBLEMS

337

unlimitedliabilityand insuranceis consistent with the propositionthatthe
dominantasset in a professional partnershipis the inalienable human
capitalof the partners.
2. Unlike professional partnerships,the proprietorships,partnerships,
and closed corporations observed in small-scale production activities
commonlyhave mechanismsfor transferringresidual claims to the cash
flowsgeneratedby assets other than human capital. Buy-out provisions
withinternalpricing rules for residual claims and first refusal rights are
examplesof such mechanisms. Moreover, the residual claims of these
organizationsare similarin other respects to those of professionalpartnerships,for example, restrictionof the residualclaims to importantdecision agents and periodic renegotiation of salaries to reflect variation
throughtime in the contributionof humancapital to net cash flows.
3. Most important,professionalpartnersdrop the limited horizon featureof their residual claims when there are substantialassets in the organizationin addition to the human capital of existing partners. For example, a departing partner is generally compensated for his share in
assets, such as cash and accounts receivable. More interesting,professionalpartnershipssometimes have devices for compensatinga retiring
partnerfor informationabout his clients that he passes along to remaining
partners.Such paymentsfor informationreducethe incentives of partners
to take actions that substitute near-termcash flows for long-termcash
flows in a manner that inhibits organizationalsurvival. It is also interesting that organizationsin business and financialconsulting that were
once professional partnershipswith limited horizon residual claims are
tendingto reorganizeas open corporations.We hypothesize that this is
largelycaused by the pressureto transferthe rightsto valuablenonhuman
capitalassets owned withinthe organizationfromone generationof residual claimantsto the next.
B. Financial Mutuals
A common form of organizationin financialactivities is the mutual.In
some financialactivities, includinglife insurance,casualtyinsurance,and
personal savings, mutualsexist side by side with open corporations,and
there is no obvious tendency for one form of organizationto dominate.
Mutualsare dominantamong investment mutualfunds, but commercial
banks are always corporations. Our task is to explain why mutuals survive in some financialactivities but not in others.
1. The ControlFunctionof RedeemableClaims. An unusualcharacteristic of mutuals is that the residual claimants are customers, for example, the policyholders of mutualinsurancecompanies, the depositors

<-----Page 12----->338

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

of mutualsavings banks, and the shareholdersof mutualfunds. However,
the unique characteristicof the residualclaims of mutuals,which is importantin understandingtheir survival value, is that the residualclaims
are redeemableon demand. The policyholder, depositor, or shareholder
can, at his initiative, turnin his claim at a price determinedby a prespecified rule. For example, the shareholderof an open-end mutualfund can
redeem his claim for the market value of his share of the fund's assets,
while the whole life or endowmentinsurancepolicyholder,like the shareholder of a mutual savings bank, can redeem his claim for its specified
value plus accumulateddividends.
There is a special form of diffuse control inherent in the redeemable
claims of financialorganizations.The withdrawaldecisions of redeemable
claim holders affect the resources underthe control of the organization's
managers,and they do so in a more direct fashion than customer decisions in nonfinancialorganizations.The decision of the claim holder to
withdraw resources is a form of partial takeover or liquidationwhich
deprives managementof control over assets. This control right can be
exercised independentlyby each claim holder. It does not requirea proxy
fight, a tender offer, or any other concerted takeover bid. In contrast,
decisions of customers in open nonfinancialcorporations,and the repricing of the corporation'ssecurities in the capital market, provide signals
about the performanceof its decision agents, but withoutfurtheraction,
either internalor from the corporate takeover market, the judgmentsof
customers and of the capital market leave the assets owned within the
organizationunder the control of the managers.
2. The Limitations of Redeemable Claims. Redeemableclaims are
not an efficient general financinginstrumentfor nonfinancialorganizations. Giving every claim holder the right to force contractionsof assets
would impose substantialcosts on nonfinancialactivities. For example,
nonfinancialcorporationstypically have large demandsfor organizationspecific assets that have lower value to other organizations.Substantial
costs would be incurredin forced sales of such illiquidassets to accommodate redemptionsof claims. In contrast, a financialorganizationpurchases and sells financialassets to meet purchases and redemptionsof
claims. This is accomplishedat low cost because financialassets are not
organizationspecific and can be traded with low transactionscosts.
There is a more subtle problem with redeemable residual claims in
nonfinancialactivities. The pricingrule used to redeem claims preempts
developmentof an outside secondary marketfor the claims. No one will
buy at a price higher than the redemptionprice or sell at a lower price.
The absence of secondary marketsfor the redeemableclaims of financial
organizationsis no problem since redemptionprice rules (for example,
the net asset value rule for mutualfund shares)can be based on prices of

<-----Page 13----->AGENCYPROBLEMS

339

financialassets quoted in the capital market. In contrast, the residual
claimsof nonfinancialorganizationsare claims on uncertainfuture cash
flows.Withouta secondary marketfor the claims, accurateand inexpensive external indexes of their value would not exist, and any internal
redemptionpricingrule would be costly or arbitrary.
3. CorporateFinancial Organizations. Ouranalysis should also explainwhy some financialorganizationsare mutualsand others are open
corporations.The theory predicts that more of the business of financial
mutualsis managementof portfoliosof financialassets whereascorporate
financialorganizationsare more involved in business activities requiring
assets that are expensive to trade and that generate
organization-specific
flows that are not easily priced.
cash
net
future
uncertain
Observationof different financial organizationsis roughly consistent
withthese hypotheses. Most investmentmutualfunds manageportfolios
of traded securities. The funds are open-end mutuals with redeemable
residualclaims, except for a handful of closed-end funds organized as
open corporationswith nonredeemablecommon stock residual claims.
Consistentwith our hypothesis, the closed-end funds often hold assets
suchas real estate or shares in new ventures that are expensive to value
andto trade, though this is not universal.18
Commercialbanks are requiredby law to be corporations.Ouranalysis
suggeststhat they would be corporationsin the absence of the requirement. A major part of bank business is providingtransactionservices.
Depositorspay for these services directly or by forgoingreturnson deposits. The primary assets of commercial banks are short-termloans.
Grantingand renewingthese loans involves monitoringthe borrowersand
certifyingcredit worthiness-a service for which the borrowerspay. The
capitalvalue of the stochastic net cash flows from services to depositors
andborrowerswould not easily be capturedin the internalpricingrule of
a redeemableresidual claim.
Whatsurvives in commercialbankingis a contract structureinvolving
depositsthat, like all redeemableclaims, allow the depositorsto affect the
resources under managementcontrol. Consistent with our model, variation in deposits is met by purchasesand sales of governmentand private

common stock. Since the common stock is not redeemable, there are
incentives for development of a secondary market. The residual claims
against uncertainfuture net cash flows are then priced more effectively
than would be the case with redeemableresidualclaims for which there
would be no secondarymarket. Such mixed capitalstructures,with fixed
value redeemableclaims (policies or deposits) and nonredeemablecommon stock residualclaims, are also characteristicof the savingsbanksand
insurancecompanies organizedas open corporations.
Ouranalysis should also explain the differencesbetween the corporate
and mutualorganizationsobserved in the same financialactivity, for example, life insuranceor personal saving. Relative to the mutuals,corporate financialorganizationsshouldbe more involved in business activities
other than managementof financialassets, and these business activities
shouldinvolve relatively more nonfinancialassets that can only be varied
with large costs. The data on the business receipts (revenues other than
interest,dividends,and capitalgains) andlong-termnonfinancialassets of
banks and life insurance companies in Table 1 are consistent with these

<-----Page 15----->AGENCY PROBLEMS

341

hypotheses. Corporate commercial banks have more business receipts
relative to total receipts and more long-term nonfinancial assets relative to
total assets than mutual savings banks or savings and loan associations.
More interesting, savings and loans, which are sometimes corporations,
have relatively more business receipts and long-term nonfinancial assets
than mutual savings banks. Likewise, corporate life insurance companies
have higher ratios of business receipts to total receipts and higher ratios of
long-term nonfinancial assets to total assets than mutual life insurance
companies.19
The data for casualty insurance organizations are less supportive. Consistent with our analysis, mutual casualty companies show lower ratios of
long-term nonfinancial assets to total assets than corporate casualty companies. However, contrary to our analysis, the mutuals have higher ratios
of business receipts to total receipts.2?
Finally, an interesting organizational experiment is taking place in the
banking sector. Although commercial banks are required to be corporations, regulations restricting commercial banks and savings banks to different activities are being relaxed. The direction is toward allowing savings banks to provide services such as checking privileges and short-term
business loans, previously restricted to commercial banks. If the dominance of the corporate format in commercial banking is not the consequence of regulation, then as savings banks become involved in the service activities of commercial banking, they will tend to organize as
corporations. On the other hand, if commercial banking services can be
provided at lower prices with the mutual format, corporate commercial
banks will not survive when mutual savings banks are allowed to compete
with them.
C.

Nonprofit Organizations

The familiar economic analysis of the entrepreneurial firm is of little
help in explaining the dominance of nonprofits in some activities, such as
religion, education, research, and classical music, but not in others, including automobile manufacturing, legal services, and popular music. We
explain the survival of nonprofits in donor-financed activities as an
efficient solution to the special agency problem posed by private donations.
'9 Because policy premiums are included as business receipts, business receipts are a
larger fraction of total receipts for insurance companies than for banks. Nevertheless, comparison of the business receipts of corporate and mutual insurance companies is relevant.

Structure, and Conflict Control in Insurance Markets, 54 J. Bus. 407-33 (1981), for additional hypotheses regarding contract structures in the insurance industry.

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

1. NonprofitOrganizationsand Donations. Donationsper se do not
imply dominance for the nonprofitform. When donations are applied
directly to well-defined units of output, a for-profitproducerperceives
them as a reduction in variable costs or as an increase in demand and
increases output accordingly. In fact, we observe unit subsidies both in
activities organizedon a nonprofitbasis, for example, educationalscholarships, and in activities organizedon a for-profitbasis, for example, free
tickets to sports events for various groups.
However, some donors wish to providegeneraldonationsto particular
producers(churches, universities, etc.) ratherthan unit subsidies. Such
unrestricteddonations pose agency problemsfor any organizationwith
residual claimants. Residual claimants contract for rights to net cash
flows. When activities are financedin part throughdonations,part of net
cash flow is from resources providedby donors. Contractsthat definethe
shareof residualclaimantsin net cash flows are unlikelyto assure donors
that their resources are protected from expropriationby residual claimants. One solution to this agency problemis to have no alienableresidual
claims and to contract with donors to apply all net cash flows to output.
Thus, our hypothesis is that the absence of residual claims avoids the
donor-residualclaimant agency problem and explains the dominanceof
nonprofitsin donor-financedactivities.21
The absence of alienable residual claims in nonprofitsdoes not mean
that residual risk is not borne. When net cash flows are used to expand
outputsor to lower the prices of outputs, partof the risk of net cash flows
is borne by consumers and part by the factors used to produce the outputs. Thus, residualnet cash flows are allocated,but there are no specific
residualclaimantswith alienablepropertyrightsin net cash flows. Moreover, the absence of residualclaims does not mean that nonprofitsmake
no profits. It means that alienableclaims to profitsdo not exist.
Donations can substitutefor the resources providedby residualclaimants to purchase assets that are optimally owned rather than rented.
When held as endowment, donations also help to bond contracts with

21 Henry B. Hansmann, The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise, 89 Yale L. J. 835 (1980),
analyzes the nonprofit organization in detail, but he tends to attribute the nonprofit form
more to the nature of products than to the agency problems of donations. He treats donors
as customers and looks for product characteristics that would make for "contract failure" in
a for-profit framework. For example, charity is delivered to third parties, and the customer
(donor) has difficulty verifying delivery. Hansmann also argues that the nonprofit form is
attractive for high technology goods (because the customer has difficulty verifying quality)
and public goods. However, his approach predicts wider dominance for nonprofits (for
example, all high technology or public goods) than is observed. The hypothesis that the
nonprofit form is related to donor financing is more promising.

<-----Page 17----->AGENCY PROBLEMS

343

other agents in the organization.Froma survivalviewpointthe advantage
of donationsover resources providedby residualclaimantsis that donors
forgo claims on their donations and on the returnsearned on the donations, and this tends to allow the organizationto deliver its products at
lower prices.
Our nonprofithypothesis deals only with activities financedby donations. Such donor-financedactivities are dominated by nonprofits,for
example, private universities, churches, hospitals, charities, and cultural
performinggroups (symphony orchestras, ballet companies, and opera
companies). However, the limited scope of the hypothesis means that it
cannotexplain the nonprofitsobserved in activities where donationsplay
no role, for example, country clubs.

2. Other Explanationsfor Nonprofits. One criticismof our hy-

pothesis about the causal relationfrom donationsto the nonprofitform is
that it ignores the difficultyof measuringand selling the outputs of, for
example,churches. The inference is that this explains the nonprofitform
in these activities. It is difficultto measure all the things one gets from
religion,education, research, or culturalactivities. However, the same is
true of products such as rock music and legal or psychiatric services
marketedby organizationsthat have residualclaims. Moreover, if donations disappeared,for-profitorganizations,or more precisely organizations that have alienable residual claims, would arise to supply religion,
research,and education. Some for-profitorganizationssupply these services now. For-profiteducationalorganizationsand researchgroups sell
definableparts of their outputs; tuition for education and royalties to
patentsare examples. For-profitchurches might sell ordinations,indulgences, or admission to services. Consistent with our hypothesis, when
educationand researchare providedby organizationsthat have alienable
residualclaims, these organizationsare not also financedwith donations.
Someargue that sale of some productsand services (for example, religion)is not acceptable and that this explains the nonprofitform in these
activities. This is consistent with our hypothesis. When giving outputs
away generates more resources through donations than sale, survival
dictates the nonprofitform. Thus, universities generally make research
freelyavailablebecause this generates more resources throughresearch
grantsand other donations than direct sale of the research. Churches
usuallydo not insist on payment of admissioncharges or membertaxes
because they attract more total resources through voluntary contributions.
Coldlyeconomic statements like these lead to the criticism that our
analysis leaves no room for altruism. The opposite is true. Altruistic
internalagents increase the willingnessof altruisticcustomersand donors

<-----Page 18----->344

THE

toprovide resources. In our terms, the altruism of internal agents allows
lowcost control of agency problems and acts to bond donors and customersagainst expropriation. Strong tastes for an organization's outputs on
thepart of internal agents and customers-what we call altruism in the
caseof nonprofits-contribute to the survival of any organization. All
organizationstry to develop such brand loyalty, but the nonprofits are
especially successful, perhaps because of the nature of their products.
Somereaders claim that donors, customers, and internal agents have
tastesfor the nonprofit form itself in some activities. To explain the completedominance of nonprofits in an activity, however, this approach requiresuniformity of tastes. If subgroups of customers, internal agents,
anddonors have no preference for the nonprofit form, we would expect
more competition among profit and nonprofit organizations in donorfinancedactivities.
Finally, tax concessions are important to some nonprofits. However,
the major activities dominated by nonprofits, such as religion, private
education, research, hospital care, and certain cultural activities, were
dominated by nonprofits before taxes were a major issue.22 Our hypothesis about the relation between unrestricted donations and the
nonprofitform provides a more consistent explanation of the historical
dominanceof nonprofits in these activities. On the other hand, tax exemptionsprobably explain the nonprofits in activities where private donations
are not a factor, including nursing homes, homes for the elderly, and
private nursery schools.
3. The General Control Problem in Nonprofits. The donors of
nonprofits have agency problems with internal decision agents similar to
those faced by residual claimants in other organizations, such as open
corporations and financial mutuals, where important decision managers
do not bear a major share of the wealth effects of their decisions. We
argue in "Separation of Ownership and Control"23 that, like all other
organizations characterized by separation of decision management from
residual risk bearing, a nonprofit is on stronger footing in the competition
for survival when it has a decision system that separates the management
(initiation and implementation) and control (ratification and monitoring)
of important decisions. For nonprofits the survival value of such decision
systems is due to the assurances they provide that donations are used
effectively and are not easily expropriated.
For example, like open corporations and financial mutuals, donor
22 See id.

<-----Page 19----->AGENCY PROBLEMS

345

nonprofitshave boards of directors (or trustees) with the power to ratify
and monitorimportantdecisions and to hire, fire, and set the compensation of importantdecision agents. The similaritiesof the decision control
systems of nonprofits, financial mutuals, and open corporations, along
with the differences due to special agency problemsand special features
of residualclaims (includingthe absence thereof), are discussed in "Separationof Ownershipand Control."
V.

SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS

Most goods and services can be producedby any form of organization.
Organizationscompete for survival, and the form of organizationthat
survives in an activity is the one that delivers the productdemandedby
customers at the lowest price while covering costs.
The characteristics of residual claims are importantboth in distinguishingorganizationsfrom one anotherand in explainingthe survivalof
specificorganizationalforms in specific activities. We explainthe survival
of organizationalforms largely in terms of the comparativeadvantagesof
characteristicsof residualclaims in controllingthe agency problemsof an
activity. The analysis identifiesthe underlyingcharacteristicsof activities
that determinethe organizationalforms that survive.
A. Open Corporations
The common stock residual claims of open corporations are unrestrictedin the sense that (1) they are freely alienable,(2) they are rightsin
net cash flows for the life of the organization,and (3) stockholdersare not
requiredto have any other role in the organization.Other things equal,
the open corporationis more likely to survive in an activity the greater
1. the benefits of unrestrictedrisk sharing,
2. the benefits of specialized management,
3. the amount of organization-specificassets to be purchased,
4. the wealth requiredto bond contractualpayoffs, and
5. the lower the cost of separatingdecision management(initiationand
implementation)from decision control (ratificationand monitoring).
For example, these factors favor the open corporate form when the
technologyin an activity implies economies of scale that involve (a) large
aggregateresidual risks to be shared among residualclaimants,(b) large
demandsfor specialized decision agents throughoutthe organization,and
(c) large demands for wealth from residual claimants to bond contracts
andto purchaseorganization-specificassets. Economies of scale are also
likely to imply organizationsthat are complex in the sense that valuable
specific knowledge-knowledge that is expensive to transfer across

<-----Page 20----->346

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

agents--is widely diffused among agents.24Such complexity tends to
favor unrestrictedcommon stock residualclaims which allow specialization of managementand delegation of decision functions to agents with
valuable relevant knowledge.
The benefits of unrestrictedcommon stock residualclaims in activities
where optimal organizationsare large and complex offset the agency
costs resultingfrom the separationof decision functionsand residualrisk
bearing. In "Separation of Ownership and Control" we contend that
these agency costs are controlledby decision structuresthat separatethe
managementand control of importantdecisions.
B. Proprietorships,Partnerships,and Closed Corporations
In a fictional world where contracts with decision agents were costlessly writtenand enforced, separationand specializationof decision and
risk-bearingfunctions would involve no agency costs, and most if not all
organizationswould have unrestrictedresidualclaims. However, actual
organizationscan realize the benefits of unrestrictedresidualclaims only
by incurringcosts to control agency problemsbetween specialized decision agents and specialized residualrisk bearers. As a consequence, it is
advantageousin some activities to tradethe benefitsof unrestrictedcommon stock residualclaims for the low-cost control of agency problemsin
the decision process obtained when residualclaims are restrictedto importantdecision agents. This restrictionis a commoncharacteristicof the
residualclaims of proprietorships,partnerships,and closed corporations.
Other things equal, these organizations with their restricted residual
claims are more likely to survive in activities where the costs of separating decision managementfrom decision control are high. They are also
more likely to survive when there are no importanteconomies of scale
andthus (a) no largedemandsfor unrestrictedrisk sharingand specialized
decision skills, and (b) no large demandsfor wealth from residualclaimants to bond contracts and purchase organization-specificassets.
C. Special Forms of Residual Claims
Organizationssuch as professionalpartnerships,financialmutuals,and
nonprofitshave residual claims with unique characteristicsthat we explain as devices for controllingspecial agency problems.
1. Professional Partnerships. These are characterizedby (1) restriction of residualclaims to majordecision agents, (2) periodicrenegotiation
24 The role of specific knowledge is discussed in Fama & Jensen, Separation of Ownership and Control, in this issue.

<-----Page 21----->AGENCY PROBLEMS

347

of partnershares in net cash flows (flexiblesharingrules), and (3) inalienable residualclaims in net cash flows with horizons that are often limited
to a partner'speriod of service in the organization.Professionalpartnerships are more likely to survive in an activity when
1. valuable specific knowledge relevant to both the managementand
control of decisions is combined and diffused among agents,
2. there are no strongdemandsfor organization-specifictangibleassets,
and
3. the benefits from consultingand mutualmonitoringamong decision
agents are high.
These characteristics are observed in professional service activities
(law, public accounting, and business consulting) where (1) restricting
residual claims to importantdecision agents helps control the agency
problemscaused by delegatingcombineddecision managementand control rights with respect to cases, audits, and so forth, to agents with
relevantspecific knowledge;(2) the primaryasset of the activity is professional human capital; and (3) mutual monitoringand consulting among
agents are importantto maintainthe value of human capital, which is
sensitive to performance.
2. Financial Mutuals. The distinguishingcharacteristicof the residual claims of financial mutuals is that the policyholder, depositor, or
shareholdercan sell his claim to the organizationon demand at a price
determinedby a rule. The decision to withdrawresourcesby the holderof
a redeemableclaim is a form of partial takeover or liquidationthat deprives managementof control over assets. This mechanismfor decision
control can be exercised independentlyby each claim holder.It does not
requirea proxy fight, a tender offer, or any other concertedtakeoverbid.
Mutualsare more likely to survive in an activity the lower the cost
1. of expandingand contractingassets and
2. of obtainingaccurate indices of asset values.
These conditions occur in financial organizations where assets are
primarily the securities of other organizations. Redeemable residual
claims are a low-cost mechanism for controlling agency problems between the residualclaimantsand the decision agents of financialmutuals
because accurate and inexpensive indexes for asset values are available
and the assets are tradedwith low transactionscosts. Redeemableclaims
are a high-cost mechanismfor decision control in activities that involve
large amounts of assets not traded in secondary markets. Redeemable
residualclaims are also inefficientin activities that involve large amounts
of lumpyor organization-specificassets that can be variedonly with large
costs.
3. Nonprofits. The nonprofit organizationis characterizedby the

<-----Page 22----->348

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

absence of alienable residual claims to net cash flows and contractual
constraints on the distribution of net cash flows. Inalienable residual
claims are vested in a board of trustees and net cash flows are committed
to current and future output. Nonprofits are more likely to survive in an
activity
1. the greater is the potential supply of donations and
2. the lower is the cost of separating decision management from decision control.
The nonprofit organization is a solution to the agency problem posed by
donations. When the activities of an organization are financed in part
through donations, part of stochastic net cash flow is due to the resources
provided by donors. Contracts that define the share of residual claimants
in net cash flows are unlikely to assure donors that their resources are
protected against expropriation by residual claimants. One solution to this
agency problem between donors and residual claimants is to have no
residual claimants and to contract with donors to apply net cash flows to
future output. The absence of alienable residual claims means that decision managers in nonprofits do not bear the wealth effects of their decisions. As in other organizations where residual risk bearing and decision
management functions are separated, the resulting agency problems in the
decision process are controlled by decision structures that separate the
management and control of important decisions.
