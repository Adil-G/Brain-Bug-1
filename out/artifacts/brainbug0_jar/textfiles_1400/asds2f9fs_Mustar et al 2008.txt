University spin-off firms: lessons from ten years
of experience in Europe
Philippe Mustar, Mike Wright and Bart Clarysse

This paper advances our understanding of university spin-off creation and development in
environments outside the high-tech cluster of the USA. It adopts a multi-level approach in its
examination of this phenomenon in diverse institutional environments. In particular, units of analysis
involving universities, technology transfer offices, spin-off firms, finance providers and individual
entrepreneurs and teams are analysed. Policy implications are analysed and recommendations are
proposed for current policy on university spin-offs.

S

ince the mid-1990s, the transfer of research results to industry has received growing interest
from European policy-makers and from the
managers of university campuses or other public research organisations (PROs). Traditionally, emphasis
has been on the licensing of innovations but greater
attention is now being paid internationally to the creation of new ventures that involve the spin-off of technology and knowledge generated by PROs.
Governments and institutions have been very active in
creating measures, schemes, initiatives, programmes,
laws, technology transfer offices (TTOs) etc. to foster
the creation of university spin offs (USOs). These
public policies are a response to the capacity of USA
universities to generate high-growth technological

firms from Genentech to Google. The USA capacity
to transform research results into high-growth firms
appears to be a model for Europe to emulate.
Across several European countries, researchers
have shown that there has been a substantial increase
in the creation of USOs (Wright et al., 2003;
Clarysse and Moray, 2004). This rise in the number
of USOs seems to have been accelerated by at least
three contextual factors. First, the ownership of intellectual property (IP) rights by TTOs relative to
that of faculty has increased. Most countries have
enacted Bayh-Dole-like legislation, which grants
universities the rights over their own IP (OECD,
2003). Second, there is increasing institutional pressure on PROs to commercialise research through licensing and/or academic spin-offs. Third is the
availability of public funds aimed at addressing the
so-called financing and knowledge gap (Wright et
al., 2006). However, notwithstanding this increase in
the number of USOs, major challenges remain in
both creating and developing USOs that generate
growth in employment, profits and financial gains.
Concurrently, the literature on USOs has grown
rapidly (Mustar et al., 2006). This literature can be
divided into four distinct streams. First, a policyoriented stream of papers typically deals with issues
relating to bridging the knowledge and/or finance
gaps supposedly faced by spin-offs. The finance gap
refers to the need for funding by technologyintensive start-ups that have difficulties in obtaining
early stage venture capital (VC). The knowledge gap

in contrast refers to the need for business coaching
by early stage high-tech start-ups. The spin-off companies supposedly lack entrepreneurial knowledge
skills to develop their businesses (Franklin et al.,
2001). A second stream of research fits within the
resource-based view of the firm and emphasises the
heterogeneity between the different types of technology intensive spin-offs (Heirman and Clarysse,
2004; Druihle and Garnsey, 2004). This research
stream emphasises the importance of particular resources, notably the human resources of spin-offs
(Forbes et al., 2006; Vanaelst et al., 2006; Nicolau
and Birley, 2003), to predict their likelihood of success or their ability to attract financial resources
such as VC (Hellman and Puri, 2000; Wright et al.,
2006). Third, we can distinguish the institutional
view which suggests that the environment in which
spin-offs are created has a specific impact on the
starting configuration of these companies (Mustar,
1997, 2002; Moray and Clarysse, 2005). Finally,
some authors have taken the view that it is necessary
to study spin-offs as a process rather than a single
decision in time (Vohora et al., 2004).
Although the literature on spin-offs has mushroomed in recent years, our contextual understanding of the policy implications resulting from these
findings remains limited. Our point of departure is
that these two issues, the policies and the spin-offs,
are inextricably linked. To understand the creation
and the development of these firms, it is necessary to
take into account the support they have benefited
from, and conversely, it seems difficult to evaluate
public policies in this field without understanding
the nature of these firms and the processes involved
in their creation and development (Mustar, 2002).

This paper considers research on spinoffs based on empirical evidence in the
spin-off and high-tech literature

This paper seeks specifically to contribute to policy research relating to spin-offs based upon the
empirical evidence in the spin-off and high-tech literature. In contrast to previous research in which
policy insights have predominantly been based on a
small number of successful USA institutions such as
MIT and Stanford (Shane and Stuart, 2002), we
draw upon a literature including observations from
European studies and analyses of mid-range universities. Our aim is to generate new policy conclusions
that are more apposite to meeting the challenges in
creating and developing spin-offs across a broad
range of universities. We would stress that the purpose of this paper is not to provide a systematic
review of the literature but to develop policy conclusions and recommendations. Systematic reviews of
the literature are contained in Rothaermel et al.
(2007) for the period to the end of 2005 and in
Siegel et al. (2007) for the period to 2007.
The analysis in this article is based on a multilevel programme of studies carried out across
Europe. The programme covers issues relating to
universities, TTOs, spin-off firms, academic entrepreneurs, financiers and government policy. For example, data relating to the activities of TTOs were
identified by different studies using both quantitative
and qualitative methods at the national and the
European level. To examine the different incubation
processes in universities and public research institutes in-depth analysis was carried out in 50 institutions across 13 European regions. To examine
university spin-off development, qualitative data
were collected using in-depth interviews with representatives from 12 spin-offs, as well as their financial investors and associated universities. For the
analysis of the spin-off team processes, a detailed
field study of ten academic spin-offs located in
Flanders was carried out. To examine issues relating
to the perspective of financiers, a questionnaire survey of 27 VC funds in the UK and a subsequent
face-to-face study of 65 VC firms in six European
countries was used. The analysis of the public policies to foster academic spin-offs results from an
in-depth study in France and the UK and from an
international comparative analysis. Full details of the
studies have been provided in Wright et al. (2007,
pp. 26–30).
The paper unfolds along the following lines. First,
we summarise the main results from the above research work undertaken on spin-offs and, relatedly,
high-tech start-ups in several European countries

Science and Public Policy March 2008

<-----Page 2----->University spin-off firms

(mainly Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden and the
the UK). Second, we propose some policy recommendations at two different levels: the university
and the government.
Summary of the evidence
Policies to bridge financial and knowledge gaps
have had limited effects

Interest in technological entrepreneurship is not new
in Europe. During the 1970s, public policies in the
UK, Germany, France and elsewhere tried to develop a VC industry on the basis that VC was the
key element of the success of Silicon Valley
(Lockett et al., 2002). During the 1990s, policy focused on creating new stock markets to provide an
exit for VC investments. But the development of a
VC industry and the creation of new stock markets
were not sufficient to give rise to a large number of
new technological companies. At the end of the
1990s, policy focused on the notion that the early
phases of many of these start-ups were closely tied
to public-sector research laboratories (Larédo and
Mustar, 2001).
For this purpose, European countries have developed various frameworks to facilitate the process of
start-up creation in general. Experience in these
countries has shown that neither these frameworks,
nor money alone (VC funds) were enough to
develop a dynamic spin-off sector. It was necessary
to create diverse micro (or meso) schemes or instruments. These measures concern: (a) the ownership of IP; (b) changes to researcher status so that
academics, who are public servants in many
countries, are able to create a company; (c) support
for a project or firm; and (d) the development of
TTOs, incubators and seed capital funds in or around
universities and public research institutions.1
The ownership of IP and the legislative changes,
which make it possible for an academic to take equity are so-called facilitators. However, each European country also developed stimulators for spin-off
policy. At first, the general view was that researchers were facing a so-called ‛finance gap’. This gap
implied that there was insufficient 3F (friends, family and fools) money to cover the pre-seed and even
the seed phase, which researchers faced when they
had an idea they wished to commercialise. In the
USA, 3Fs provide the first financial resources for
start-ups (Roberts, 1991). In Europe, the various
Global Enterprise Monitor reports have clearly
shown that 3F money lags behind in comparison
with the USA. This immobility of capital has inspired national governments to develop a range of
initiatives to support innovative start-ups and spinoffs financially. These initiatives can be classified
into six categories, ranging from loan guarantee
schemes to 100% public funds2 (Wright et al.,
2007).

Science and Public Policy March 2008

There is little doubt that the various public forms
of finance boosted the amount of spin-offs created in
the mid- and late 1990s (Wright et al., 2006). However, it remains questionable whether or not these
spin-offs will become sustainable companies. Publicly available evaluations of financing schemes are
limited and have tended to focus on the number of
spin-offs created and funding received rather than
their effects (e.g. SQW, 2005).
After the boost in the number of companies
created following the development of various
financing schemes at the end of the 1990s, the average number of companies created gradually began to
fall. Universities complained about the lack of projects among their researchers and the low level of
entrepreneurial initiative among their academics. So,
business plan competitions and various forms of entrepreneurship training were developed to bridge the
so-called ‘knowledge gap’. This knowledge gap refers both to the lack of awareness among researchers
to engage themselves in entrepreneurial activities
and the lack of knowledge among them about how to
develop a business plan (Lockett et al., 2005).
To address this gap, various sorts of business incubation initiatives have been stimulated. Although
theoretically, these business incubators have a very
clear role, our analysis based on 50 cases across
Europe shows that they often lack sufficient in-depth
knowledge about the sector or the technology to be
really useful (Clarysse et al., 2005). The tenant
companies included in our analysis were not impressed with the services offered to them by the incubator in which they were located. This finding
suggests that incubators are most useful when they
are really focused on a certain technology, sector
or at least the main departments of a technological
university. If not, the services that are offered tend
to stay only marginally important and probably
remain limited to the facility management that is
provided.
Since incubators have been the subject of policy
attention in many countries for several years, the
finding of their relatively low added value to the
tenant companies is intriguing (Clarysse et al., 2005;
Phan et al., 2005). If they provide so little added
value, why do policy makers repeatedly use incubators as an instrument to leverage business plans?
One explanation might be the legitimacy which
these organisations have developed. Legitimacy of
an organisational form leads to institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). This means
that policy makers use benchmarks about the initiatives taken in other countries upon which to base
their own policy actions. Incubators are clearly such
a benchmark result.
In addition to the independent analysis of the different policy initiatives, an important policy concern
relates to the complementarity between the diverse
initiatives taken to promote spin-offs. In the French
case, there is an important overlap between the business plan competition and the incubators. But our
69

<-----Page 3----->University spin-off firms

analysis of the available data and our discussion
with the managers of the incubators and the public
seed capital funds shows that there is a significant
gap between these two instruments (Mustar, 2006).
The linear government intervention model in its present form (competition → incubation → seed money
fund) is only partially effective. This linear model is
limited as only a very small percentage of the startups financed by seed capital funds are from publicsector incubators. At the end of the year 2005, the 11
public seed capital funds resulting from the project
initiative of 1999 (five national funds and six regional funds) were invested in 106 distinct companies. Among these, 45 companies (43%) are located
in the incubators: there is thus a complementarity
between the funds and the incubators. However,
these 45 companies accounted for only 6% of the
844 companies located in the incubators at the end
of 2005 (Direction de la technologie, 2006). As so
few projects are financed by seed capital, this undermines the main premise of French policy towards
spin-offs. Existing data already show that the government intervention model in its present form functions only partially.
The findings of quantitative and qualitative studies in various countries are consistent on one point:
the majority of public-research spin-offs are and remain very small enterprises. Most studies show that
the majority of these high-tech small and medium
enterprises remain very small or grow slowly, even
if these spin-offs are a fast growing subpopulation of
the entire population of young technology-based
firms (Heirman and Clarysse, 2006). (For example
in France three-quarters are still in business six years
after set up, but 80% of them have less than ten employees (Mustar, 1998, 1999)). Although promising,
it is too early for a true evaluation of them. Most
spin-offs have been founded since the mid-1990s
and were therefore less than ten years old at the time
of our data collection. The fact that a majority of
these firms still exist might simply be a reflection of
the larger amounts of public support available to
them.
It is also important to recognise that researchbased spin-off firms are not a source of revenues for
PROs. Contrary to the third stream policy idea
where spin-offs are viewed as bringing supplementary resources to the university, USOs will not create
enormous wealth for PROs. Many studies of the
financial returns from investments in innovating activities show that a small number of projects generate the major part of the returns, see for example the
effects of the Bayh-Dole Act (Mowery, 2001). Only
rarely have we found instances of this return in
Europe. For the large majority of the PROs, their
USOs will not bring additional funding.
The reason for these disappointing effects may
partly lie with a policy constructed on an anticipated
linear trajectory from the creation of a firm by a
scientist based on a licence or patent from a public
sector institution to a venture-backed firm that will
70

be able to float on a stock market. These difficulties
of the USO sector in Europe are linked to this
mythical view of the creation and development
process of a USO. This policy approach ignores the
diversity of USOs, which is the focus of the second
lesson.
Spin-offs are not homogeneous
Our detailed analysis at the firm level suggests that
three very different types of spin-offs exist, which
we have labelled, respectively, the ‘VC-backed
type’, the ‘prospector type’ and the ‘lifestyle type’.
(Wright et al., 2007) (see Table 1). Each type differs
significantly from the others in terms of institutional
link, resource base and business model.
The VC-backed type (or ‘investor acceptance
type’) is probably the most visible and attractive
from a policy perspective. It is the kind of company
that primarily plays a role in the market for ideas
(Gans and Stern, 2003), builds up credibility and
visibility in a fast manner and looks for continuous
media attention. This means that its business model
is oriented towards convincing different stakeholders, among which investors are an important
party, about its technology.
Although the VC-backed academic spin-off is
attractive through its growth process, it implies a
number of risks which have to be recognised by both
the university and the policy maker. First, few
research groups have the potential to start up such a
company. This company requires a balanced portfolio of technology, which is carefully constructed
through the licensing or buying in of IP developed
by others and protected by their own IP. It also
requires a research group which has received recognition in the scientific community and which plays a
significant role in the market for ideas. Finally, it requires human and financial resources which underscore this reputation. In other words, it must be able
to attract a significant amount of VC at start-up to be
credible in its actions and it must be able to attract
most of the researchers that were working on the
technology at the university or public research institute to retain the scientific credibility. However,
each university is likely to have only a few research

groups that are able to generate this kind of company. As a result, it is unrealistic to set quantitative
targets for PROs in terms of the number of spin-offs
they should create each year. In fact, the possibility
of creating such a spin-off will be rather exceptional.
In addition, the spin-off will inherently represent a
risk. The spin-off will probably be sold to an incumbent firm. If the incumbent firm is not located in the
region or even the country in which the spin-off was
founded, this probably means that it will have a foreign parent company and may become an R&D lab
of this company. In other words, policy makers cannot expect these companies to generate excessive
amounts of employment. Only a few of these spinoffs will be able to achieve significant growth. Even
then, there are a number of challenges.
Most academic spin-offs will not belong to the VCbacked group. The potential of these spin-offs will be
more limited because the technology base which underpins their founding is not sufficiently new or
credible to play a significant role in the market for
ideas. Usually, they have a patent-protected prototype
or maybe a beta version to sell on the market for products. Unlike the market for ideas, the market for products follows a bootstrapping logic. This means that
the company should economise on its expenses and
use internal funds instead of external forms of capital.
The time to break-even is crucial and the sources of
finance that are used should not interfere with the

business model. In most cases, the business model
adopted by these companies is focused on consulting
or contract research which requires little capital investment. In contrast, external private equity investors have expectations of returns that exceed those
that can be generated in the product market. Therefore, they tend to interfere with the business model of
spin-offs since they are not interested in investing in
companies which do not have the potential for rapid
growth. Consulting or contract research companies
typically do not have such a growth path. The remaining spin-offs can be divided into two groups.
The ‘prospector’ category of companies attract
external companies from public or private equity
funds which are linked to the university or public research lab.3 These companies begin with a business
model which essentially follows a contract research
or consulting path and attempts to identify a product
to commercialise. Policy makers and university administrators should be aware that external capital
from a pre-seed capital fund is probably not the best
way to finance these prospectors. In the early phases
of the start-up, especially when the business model
is not clear, pre-seed sources of finance should allow
the company to fail or to be free to adopt a business
model that is not in line with a seed fund investor’s
expectation. As a result, one should carefully analyse the need for and the management of pre-seed
capital funds.
71

<-----Page 5----->University spin-off firms

The ‘lifestyle type’. We have identified academic
spin-offs which follow a very familiar business
model which is oriented on market acceptance (as
opposed to the VC-backed type which is investor
acceptance oriented). These spin-offs start small in a
market for products or services and optimise the
time to break-even, following the pecking order
theory in terms of financing Wright et al., 2006).
Some of these companies might become highgrowth companies later on, but this is often not clear
at start-up. External factors such as: increasing customer demand, particular partnerships or favourable
financial market conditions, might be the reason
why their business model makes the transition from
a low-growth orientation towards a high-growth orientation. But even if they remain as low-growth oriented companies, their added value as a population
might be significant. However, technology transfer
officers usually overlook these initiatives and universities show very little support for researchers or
academics that want to create a company which does
not involve a formal transfer of technology. This is
remarkable since these companies are less demanding in terms of human, financial and technological
resources and might increase the visibility of the
university in the region. They form the heart of what
is often referred to as the entrepreneurial university.
An estimation based on the French case shows
that around 50% of the research-based spin-offs are
of the prospector type, between 30 and 35% are of
the lifestyle type, and between 15 and 20% of the
VC-backed type (CapInTech, 2003). Clarysse (2004)
has shown very similar percentages for Belgium.
10% of the research-based spin-offs created after
1995 were VC-backed, 50% prospector and 40%
lifestyle.
TTO organisation directly impacts
the spin-offs
Our research on how PROs organise their spin-off
support activities, based on 50 cases drawn from 13
of the most high-tech regions of Europe (Clarysse et
al., 2005) distinguishes between three sustainable
models: (a) the low selective model; (b) the incubator model; and (c) the supportive model.
First, the ‘low selective model’ fits closely with
the idea of an entrepreneurial university (Etzkowitz,
2003). Its objective is to stimulate as many entrepreneurial ventures as possible. The entrepreneurs that
set up these ventures do not need to belong to the
university on permanent contracts nor do they have
to be based on technology developed at the university. The model facilitates the spin-off process
through granting small amounts of money to potential entrepreneurs and the provision of office space
at the university. The majority of the spin-offs
created fit the ‘lifestyle’ company profile. As described above, this company focuses on contract research and consulting as its main activity. Not
72

surprisingly, this lifestyle company is the one most
frequently encountered in a university setting. Researchers or academics will have a tendency to set
up a company with a business model that is familiar
to their pre-start up activities and which needs little
investment. Lifestyle companies fit this profile.
They need little investment and the business model
of consulting, contract research or, in a rare case,
product sales is familiar to the researcher, academic
or student who wants to set up this type of company.
Despite the attractiveness of the low selective
model, the incubator model has received much more
attention among policy makers and TTOs. The incubator model focuses on the creation of spin-offs
which we have labelled as VC-backed. Because this
model aims to stimulate the creation of growth oriented ventures, it is highly selective in projects it
supports; it is not the quantity but the quality of the
created ventures that counts. As suggested, this VCbacked model implies that the technology is innovative and can be protected. As a result, we observe
that TTO officers in the incubator model devote significant time to the protection of the technology base
in the incubation or pre-start up phase. This includes
the licensing in of missing elements and a clear distinction between exclusive and non-exclusive patent
rights. Later on in the process, the VC-backed model
demands a well-balanced founding team, preferably
with experience in the sector. Again, during the incubation phase the TTO officer is actively searching
to compose a team which can attract an investor.
Finally, the VC-backed model assumes that the spinoff can attract a sufficient amount of capital at startup. Again the TTO is actively looking for private
venture capitalists that are willing to invest the
capital at start-up. Because of its size at founding,
public VC cannot provide the capital required
without the help of private VC.
Finally, other universities have developed an inbetween type, which we label the ‘supportive
model’. Unlike the incubator model, the prospective
model is not so selective in terms of the kind of spinoffs it wants to stimulate. Quality is traded against
quantity. So, even companies with few growth prospects can receive support in this model. In contrast
with the low selective model, however, the companies that receive support usually embody a formal
transfer of technology from the university to the
company. They also start with a larger capital basis
than the lifestyle companies and they might attract
surrogate entrepreneurs to complete the founding
team. The company model that probably best fits the
kind of companies targeted by this model is the
‘prospector’ type. These companies are started very
early in the product development process and are not
certain at start-up about their business model. They
are not yet able to attract VC, but their ambition is
higher than creating a lifestyle company. The public
money associated with the university allows these
companies to start. The development of a structure
to support academics that want to create a company

Science and Public Policy March 2008

<-----Page 6----->University spin-off firms

within the university seems to be a key success factor in the development of such a model. In such a
company, academics usually perform contract research or consulting. Without having to leave the
university and with a business model that is very
familiar to them, they can experience whether or not
creating an entrepreneurial venture is attractive to
them.
A general university may be in need of the three
models described above. An incubation model might
serve a research department which is leading in its
field and which has developed a critical mass in a
certain domain. The low selective model fits very
well with the idea of an entrepreneurial university
and can also serve the social science departments.
Finally, the supportive model might be useful for
those departments where the critical mass is lower
but that have developed a specific type of technology which might be a success on the market place. A
major difficulty at most universities is that TTOs
tend to be structured following one of these models
and traditionally have had difficulties in allowing the
existence of different models at the same institution.
On the basis of previous work (Clarysse et al.,
2005), we estimate that the incubator model represents around 10% of the incubators, the supportive
model around 35% of the incubators and the low selective model around 55%). Although PROs may
now be adapting their approach, the problem is that
a uniform approach may be adopted to a heterogeneous set of spin-offs, many of which may not be
suitable for support on the basis of the model used
by VCs. Moreover, it was also evident from our
analysis that some universities seek to adopt an incubator approach without sufficient resources or developing the necessary capabilities to enable their
objective of high-value spin-offs to be fulfilled. This
mismatch between resources, capabilities and objectives gives rise to resource deficient and competence
deficient incubator models.
Entrepreneurial teams in spin-offs
The previous point emphasised the importance of the
founding teams in the process of creating spin-offs.
In particular, our detailed qualitative studies of ten
entrepreneurial teams in spin-offs at different stages
of their development shows that TTO officers as
‘privileged witnesses’ tend to match researchers
with surrogate entrepreneurs that offer their services
to the TTO (Vanaelst et al., 2006). As such, the TTO
officer plays a very important role in this team formation process. However, since various researchers
(e.g. Heirman and Clarysse, 2006) have shown that
the quality of the founding team has a very important impact on the subsequent performance of the
spin-off, this team formation process needs to be addressed carefully. More specifically, researchers
have shown that teams which are diverse in their
functional background but combine this with joint

Science and Public Policy March 2008

working experience tend to be quite successful. This
is often attributed to the positive impact of ‘cognitive diversity’, which stimulates members of a team
to challenge each other and hence make better decisions (Vanaelst et al., 2006). Cognitive diversity not
only assumes a different functional background, it
also implies that the team members have a different
view on how the spin-off should develop.
Adopting an organisational culture framework,
which classifies team members according to their
flexible versus control orientation and their internal
versus external orientation, shows that team members that combine flexibility and external orientation
tend to be ‘innovative’ persons that embody a high
degree of creativity and vision (Wright et al., 2007).
Many high flying academics tend to have a high degree of this orientation. In contrast, people with a
high degree of external orientation but also a high
degree of focus on control, tend to be ‘goal oriented’. In a founding team, it is very important to
have a person with such a vision since their absence
is likely to be a project killer. Privileged witnesses
such as TTO officers should recognise the need for
these different personalities. However, our research
shows that often the surrogate entrepreneurs (Franklin
et al., 2001) attracted to form a founding team with
the researchers have the same kind of ‘innovative’
orientation as the researchers themselves. This leads
to homogeneity instead of heterogeneity at the
founding team level. This reflects the problem that
TTO officers typically do not want to have conflicts
with the researchers on whom they are dependent for
deal flow and invention disclosures.
Functional heterogeneity is related to what
researchers label the cognitive diversity in teams.
Cognitive diversity means that founding team members challenge each other about the strategy the spinoff should ideally follow. Cognitive diversity
increases the performance of a team because discussion leads to better decisions. However, this discussion should not result in affective conflict, which
means that the founders start to dislike each other.
Teams who know each other and who have developed non-instrumental relations before starting the
spin-off are much less likely to experience affective
conflict than those who do not know each other
(Wright et al., 2007). Non-instrumental relations can
be joint working experience or similar.
Spin-off development is iterative
Our examination of the different phases in the development of spin-offs based on detailed qualitative
studies of 12 spin-offs, their entrepreneurial teams,
their TTO advisors, and their VC investors showed
that these could be characterised as involving an iterative process that may require issues that arose at
previous phases to be revisited. In moving between
phases, spin-offs needed to address specific critical
junctures (Vohora et al., 2004). The first critical
73

<-----Page 7----->University spin-off firms

juncture involving opportunity recognition typically
requires the spin-off to acquire the capability to
synthesise scientific knowledge with an understanding of the market to which it might apply. There
may be a need for networks of market contacts outside the scientific environment of the university.
The second critical juncture (entrepreneurial commitment) requires the venture to acquire an entrepreneurial champion committed to the development
of the venture. Where this is a problem, it appears
to arise from universities not providing sufficient
resources and network contacts or not developing
appropriate incentives and policies. As a result,
academic scientists or surrogate entrepreneurs fail
to become sufficiently committed to developing the
spin-off. The third critical juncture, that of credibility, is particularly problematical due to: the academic entrepreneurs lacking a commercial track
record; the often intangible nature of the spin-off’s
resources at this early stage; and the noncommercial environment from which the spin-off
emerged. All these elements create barriers to attracting customers and financiers. Building links
with surrogate entrepreneurs at earlier phases in the
development process may help the spin-off overcome this juncture. However, universities need to
devise policies to attract the surrogate in the first
place, such as through building network links. The
demonstration of proof of concept and the potential
for a portfolio of products may also help to establish credibility in relation to financiers. Relocation
in commercial premises away from the university
can help signal a commercial approach to prospective customers. The fourth critical juncture (sustainable returns), requires the spin-off to develop
entrepreneurial capabilities that enable the venture
to reconfigure deficiencies from earlier phases into
resource strengths, capabilities and social capital.
In the absence of overcoming social capital deficiencies, resources weaknesses and inadequate
internal capabilities, spin-offs did not have the absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989; Zahra
and George, 2002) to become established as rentgenerating businesses. In the earlier development
phases it is the individual entrepreneur who needs to
acquire the requisite human capital that embodies
these entrepreneurial capabilities. Over time, as
growth became more turbulent and complexity of
the challenges increased, the entrepreneurial capabilities become located in the team.
Important financial interactions for spin-offs
TTOs and spin-offs see VC as more important early
in the process than internal funds. Our study of 27 of
the most active VCs investing in high-tech ventures
in the UK shows that, while venture capitalists do
invest smaller sums, their preference is to invest in
spin-offs after the seed stage, particularly once proof
of concept has been achieved (Wright et al., 2006;
74

Clarysse et al., 2007). Our evidence from face-toface interviews with 65 high-tech investing VC
firms located in six European countries suggests that
this pattern is the same in different European
countries. For example Moray and Clarysse (2005)
came to a similar finding in an in-depth study of a
Belgian public research organisation, while Heirman
and Clarysse (2004) have reported that less than one
out of ten spin-outs could attract VC, other than
from the Belgian University Challenge Fund (UCF)
programme in the seed stage.
From our survey of spin-off activity in 124 UK
universities, UCFs in the UK appear to have become
more important in the very early stage of funding requirements but these are typically concentrated
among the top universities, or among a small number of USOs. This also appears to be the case with
similar schemes elsewhere, such as the Fonds
d’amorçage publics in France (Mustar, 2006).
Universities point to the difficulties in attracting
VC and business angel finance but mechanisms to
increase the possibility of internal funding and debt
financing as an intermediate step towards VC investment remain underdeveloped, reflecting the financial constraints upon universities, especially in
those countries where the universities have limited
autonomy.
VC firms consider that universities fail sufficiently to understand their requirements or to present
investor-ready proposals for the funding of spin-offs
(Wright et al., 2007). Few VC firms have developed
links with universities and even fewer with more
than one university.
Last, but not least, many VC firms do not possess
sufficient appropriate human capital skills to screen
and add value to potential spin-off investees.
Policy recommendations
Many studies have shown that university systems
differ across countries. Over the last 20 years, universities have moved into an era of mass higher education. We have observed in Europe a large diversity
in the way universities have developed their ‘third
mission’ (i.e. their contribution to industry and

Universities point to the difficulties in

society beyond traditional areas of research and
teaching). These three roles are articulated differently across countries and at the same time between
universities inside the same country. Some scholars
have observed “a shift from the traditional generic
university – embracing all disciplines from mathematics to humanities and aspiring to excellence in all
of them – to the specialised or ‘thematic’ university
with research excellence concentrated in just one or
two fields” (Larédo, 2003). But despite these differences, it is striking to see the importance that the
public authorities across Europe attach to university
engagement in a third stream of activities including
patenting and spin-off creation.
In this section, we propose some policy recommendations at two different levels: the university
(and public research organisations) and the government. These recommendations are derived from the
evidence in each of the previous sections. This
evidence highlights that the heterogeneity of both
spin-offs and the process of their creation and development present challenges to the effectiveness of
policy implementation that have hitherto been
neglected. But the reader needs to bear in mind that
the effectiveness and efficiency of these recommendations depends not only on the design and implementation of different policy schemes or instruments
but mainly on policy mixes, that is on the way that
instruments are combined. This emphasises the need
for a new research focus in science and public policy: to pay attention to the policy mix rather than to
individual and separate policy tools.
University level
University strategies

Given the major challenges facing PROs and universities with respect to generating revenue streams
from spin-off activity, universities need to adopt a
strategic approach to knowledge transfer. They need
to make choices concerning institutional goals and
priorities, resource allocation, technological emphasis, patent strategies and modes of technology transfer. Universities can choose a mixture of licensing,
start-ups, sponsored research and other mechanisms
for technology transfer. However, there is a need to
recognise that a spin-off strategy requires different
resources and capabilities from those required for
licensing and sponsored research activities.
Most policy attention seems to be focused on
spin-off creation, yet this may still mean that the
venture is a long way from generating revenue. Support may be needed to ensure that spin-offs are not
created too early before a prototype is available. The
sections of this paper on policies to bridge financial
and knowledge gaps, and on spin-offs not being
homogeneous, indicated that spin-offs were heterogeneous in terms of their growth prospects and market focus. Hence, the development of the venture

Science and Public Policy March 2008

post-creation may also require different expertise as
it does not simply require the continuation of activities, resources, business models etc. adopted during
the initial phase.
Opportunities for knowledge transfer and academic entrepreneurship vary substantially across
disciplines (Wright et al., 2004). Different types of
spin-off in different disciplines may have different
business models. For example, business models for
biotechnology sectors may not be applicable for ITrelated sectors, nanotechnology or engineering.
Many mid-range provincial universities may traditionally have adopted a broad base of disciplines
but their limited resources may constrain their ability
to be world class in all areas. In developing a spinoff strategy, these institutions may need to focus on
developing a critical mass of world class research in
a more focused number of areas where they can
attract industrial partners.
Incubators Policies need to recognise that the
heterogeneity of spin-offs identified earlier requires
a differentiated approach to their creation and development. The section titled ‘TTO organisation
directly impacts the spin-offs’ indicated heterogeneity in incubator types. Some universities may seek to
facilitate large numbers of lifestyle, consulting or
service start-ups that, individually, are unlikely to
grow large but which collectively may have a significant impact on local economies. Other universities may seek to provide a more intensive support
regime that focuses on producing fewer spin-offs in
areas of research excellence. TTOs thus need to
develop a fit between the resources at the TTO level,
in terms of the availability of skilled personnel and
capabilities for spinning-off ventures, and the espoused strategy of the TTO (Clarysse et al., 2005).
The heterogeneity of spin-offs within a particular
university may thus require the establishment of different incubator models that run separately from one
another. A central part of the implementation of a
spin-off strategy for universities is to match their
objectives with the resources and capabilities of the
incubators in which the firms are to be developed.
IP and patent strategies Universities need to develop IP and patent strategies. TTOs need to ensure
that IP is clean, well-defined and protected before

trying to raise commercial interest. This involves
costs in terms of recruiting sufficient expertise or
paying for external advice. The ownership of IP
needs to be resolved. The IP and patent strategy
should thus consider what technology is proprietary
to the department, which is licensed on an exclusive
base and which parts are licensed on a non-exclusive
basis.
Remunerating and attracting TTOs The third to
sixth subsections of the section of this paper titled
‘Summary of the evidence’ emphasised, from different perspectives, the importance of the expertise in
TTOs. Increasing government policy recognition is
being given to the need to enhance the skills of
TTOs (e.g. Her Majesty’s Treasury, 2004). However, a major problem concerns the ability of universities to attract and remunerate personnel with the
appropriate skills to support the creation and development of spin-outs, especially those that will create
significant value. The requisite skills base extends
beyond the need to be able to provide legalistic skills
in protecting IP to a requirement to be able to provide opportunity recognition and other commercialisation skills. There is a need both for training, which
some industry associations are providing, but also
for further recruitment of personnel with private
sector experience and of attracting VC (Wright et
al., 2006).
Boundary spanners and university–industry links
We have already indicated in this paper that university spin-offs may not be able to develop in the marketplace because academics and businesspeople
effectively speak different languages. There is thus a
need for universities to recruit and develop individuals who can act as intermediaries or boundary spanners between the two areas. These individuals will
need to be able to transfer knowledge by building
links between academics and business. The links
might usefully involve the development of understanding of business and market concepts and the
identification of customers, financing, and so forth.
Evidence available from pilot schemes such as the
Medici Fellowship Scheme in the UK suggests that
universities need to focus on enhancing the entrepreneurial behaviour skills of fellows and to develop
a more defined career path for fellows if these
schemes are to be effective over a longer period of
time (Mosey et al., 2006).
Academics and the third stream

Star and middle-ranking researchers A central policy issues concerns the impact of entrepreneurial
activities on individual academics. Researchers are
heterogeneous in their academic and entrepreneurial
expertise. To what extent are entrepreneurial activities likely to be most attractive and feasible for top
or middle-range researchers? To what extent does
76

involvement in entrepreneurial activities adversely
impact top researchers? Interestingly, studies in both
the USA and Europe clearly show that leading researchers are not disadvantaged. Van Looy et al.
(2004) found, for the University of Leuven in Belgium, that engagement in entrepreneurial activities
coincides with an increased level of publication,
without affecting the nature of the publications
involved. For North America, Lowe and GonzalezBrambila (2007) also found that faculty entrepreneurs who start businesses are among the most
productive and best-cited in their respective fields.
However, they do note a differential discipline effect
with faculty entrepreneurs in engineering experiencing a more positive effect that their colleagues in
chemistry and biomedicine. This finding indicates
that academic entrepreneurship in some disciplines
requires more time and resources than in others and
leads us to suggest that policy support may need to
be developed that recognises this difference.
Top researchers may have a particular interest in
world-leading innovative companies, but they may
be able to obtain sufficient research funding from
the national funding councils. Middle-range researchers, who may experience greater difficulty in
obtaining research council funding, may find research funding from industry attractive.
Incentivising academics While there may need to
be input from entrepreneurs with external commercial experience, academic scientists may still have
an important role in spin-offs, for example in providing continuing innovations to sustain development.
Universities have introduced programmes to stimulate academics to start spin-offs, the structure
through which most universities operate creates constraints since career progression typically still depends largely upon the evaluation of a scientist’s
academic output. There is a need, both at a systemic
level and within universities, to adapt promotion and
remuneration systems so that commercialisation activities are valued. For example, standard royalty
distribution and equity holding formulae might be
adapted to specific case contexts. Mechanisms for
formalised periods of leave might be introduced to
enable academics to focus on the development of a
spin-off with the possibility of returning if the venture is not successful or the academic skills are no
longer required. More generally, these suggestions
indicate that the ‘third stream’ activities involving
the commercialisation of academic research needs to
become a core component of universities’ activities
rather than merely being bolted on to the traditional
streams of research and teaching. It may be worthwhile for universities to adopt policies of being
more flexible in the application of formulae regarding royalty distributions on licences and equity
stakes in spin-offs. This may especially be the case
in respect of ‘star scientists’ who are more likely to
obtain external grants and who are more likely to be
mobile.

Government level
Policy focus

A major issue at government level concerns the focus
of policy towards spin-offs. The section of this paper
titled ‘Policies to bridge financial and knowledge
gaps have had limited effects’ derived some lessons
from previous policy mechanisms. Overall, two broad
approaches can be distinguished. First, support for
academic spin-off firms may form part of a larger
knowledge transfer policy aimed at developing the
transfer of knowledge between universities and
business and society that constitutes third-stream activities of universities. Policy is aimed at filling both
a financial gap and knowledge gap based on the notion of addressing market failure. A decentralised
approach is adopted as funding for universities is
managed by the universities (or by a wholly owned
subsidiary of the university), and the universities can
take shares in the spin-offs. The goal is to integrate
third-stream activities into the decision-making
structure of the universities rather than them being
an add-on function. The approach adopted in the
UK, for example, exemplifies this policy.
Second, support may be part of a technological
entrepreneurship policy. The public research system
is at the centre of this policy but the measures are
not exclusive for university spin-offs. A systemic
approach is adopted with spin-off creation viewed as
a process from the lab to the market and with public
intervention covering each stage in order to address
systemic failures. The measures adopted are not part
of a broader view of the relationship between public
research and business. The French approach exemplifies this. In France, the title of the law of July
1999 is the ‘Law on innovation and research to promote the creation of innovative technology companies’; firms that are not spin-offs can take part in the
national competition and can request seed capital
funds. The emphasis is on financial issues (the competition, the seed money funds). A centralised approach is adopted as the funding is for spin-offs
(competition) or for the creation of new intermediary
institutions (incubators, seed capital funds who give
the money to spin-offs) independent of universities
and universities do not have shares in their spin-offs.
Time horizon for policy initiatives

The time horizon for government policy support for
the development of spin-offs needs careful consideration in the context of the policy objectives. While it is
difficult to justify completely open-ended support
schemes, sufficient levels of support over a sufficient
period of time are necessary if objectives of promoting spin-offs that create wealth are to be achieved.
Evaluations of policy support based on an objective
concerning the number of spin-offs created may come
to different conclusions from the case where the

Science and Public Policy March 2008

objective was to create the conditions whereby high
growth spin-offs could be developed. Our highlighting of the heterogeneity of spin-offs indicates that it
may be relatively straightforward to stimulate the
creation of consultancy style businesses serving local
markets. However, the section in this paper titled
‘TTO organisation directly impacts the spin-offs’
emphasised that it takes considerable time to develop
the capabilities and resources that are needed to develop spin-offs that can achieve significant growth in
international markets. This suggests a need for longer
term policy initiatives that help create the basis to develop spin-offs rather than just create them.
Similarly, it takes considerable time to develop
networks between universities and the business
community. Hence, for example, a potential shortcoming of schemes to develop boundary spanners is
that support may need to be provided for longer
periods than is typically the case to enable them to
develop networks both inside and outside the university. There may therefore be a need for systemic policy initiatives that provides for more longer-term
structures to develop these support mechanisms. For
example, it may take considerable time for boundary-spanning individuals to become self-financing.
Shorter term initiatives have undesirable consequences of support ending too soon, leading to leakage of the expertise that is being developed. This
problem is compounded by the associated lack of
career structure for boundary spanners, that is also
likely to leads to extensive turnover of staff.
These observations suggest that rather than introducing a plethora of short-term support schemes,
there is a need for a more strategic perspective that
envisages longer term support. A staged approach
might be envisaged whereby an integrated set of
policies is developed that would provide incremental
support contingent upon certain milestones having
been met.
Regional aspects

Regions are heterogeneous. Our analysis of incubator
types was based on those regions with relatively
strong high-tech bases; for many other regions this is
not the case. The nature of university–industry links
may thus depend on the nature of the region in which
a university is embedded (core, peripheral, and so
forth). In designing regional policies on knowledge
transfer and entrepreneurial activities at universities,
it may be important to devote explicit attention to
market segmentation in terms of which universities
within a region or locality are most suited to deliver
certain types of links with industry. Our discussion in
the sections of this paper on policies to bridge the financial and knowledge gaps, and on TTO organisation, indicates a heterogeneity in the universities and
this applies both to regions and countries. A major
tension for mid-range as opposed to top universities
arises from pressures to develop internationally
recognised areas of research excellence, with the
77

<-----Page 11----->University spin-off firms

associated critical mass, and at the same time to transfer knowledge to the local economy. A market segmentation approach may enable better matches to be
made between the range of knowledge- and technology-transfer activities that universities offer and the
different types of local industry that they can serve.
Large and small firms locally may have very different
requirements. In particular, large companies are
unlikely to be motivated to work with a university just
because it is close by; however, they may be attracted
to work with a university if it has a reputation for
world-class research and critical mass in an area.
Hence, universities need to build areas of expertise
that locally based large firms will want to access.
Small firms often need routine business management
and financial skills. For the majority of new small
firms, it is not clear that a university has a comparative advantage in the provision of such expertise.
However, there may be scope to develop this activity
in an integrated way if these firms can spin technology out from the university.
In more peripheral regions, there may be scope
for regional cooperation between universities to
create critical mass in certain areas. Universities in
developing regions might face greater difficulties in
establishing links with local industry. Equally, universities in regions that are facing decreasing economic activity might face a difficult situation, which
could be exacerbated by leakage of knowledge and
graduate mobility to more dynamic regions. Universities in more mature regions may need to develop
graduate programs that more closely match the
emerging needs of the region or that are compatible
with policies to regenerate regions. Regional authorities may have an important role in stimulating
university–industry linkages. However, the extent to
which such agencies provide an integrated set of initiatives is unclear. Policy may benefit from specific
efforts to learn from those regions identified as having developed good practice.
A further dimension of integration concerns the
development of networks among public partners in a
region such as TTOs, regional development agencies, public research labs and intermediary organisations. However, there may be scope for further
development of networks with private partners, such
as incumbent companies that are interested in a department’s technology or specialised VC funds, as
well as the development of international networks
which are important if spin-outs are to realise global
growth ambitions. Such linkages may help TTOs in
deciding whether an invention is most appropriately
developed as a license or a joint venture with a private sector corporation rather than as an independent
spin-off with VC backing (Wright et al., 2004).
Funding gaps

Extensive financial support is now available in many
countries to fund the creation of spin-offs (Wright et
al., 2006). Earlier sections of this paper have surveyed
78

the lessons to be learnt from policy attempts to address funding gaps. There is some scepticism that
such funds will generate returns that cover the cost
of investment and generate a surplus for future investment. Such funds may not be large enough to
become self-sustaining and the restrictions on the
amount that can be invested in any one project may
also lead to sub-optimal investment. Ownership and
returns in highly successful projects are likely to be
diluted after subsequent rounds of financing
(Clarysse et al., 2007).
A funding gap may exist in the slightly later phase
post-creation where the venture has established that
there is a market but has yet to earn revenues or become of sufficient size to be attractive to mainstream
VC firms. Incentives could be introduced, such as
tax breaks, to encourage investment in spin-offs that
have gone beyond the initial seed phase but which
require funding to continue product development
and to access customers.
Further, an important issue that relates to addressing funding gaps concerns attitudes of private equity
firms towards ownership of IP. VC firms may
seek the assignment of IP rather than licensing in order to offset some of the risks of investment but
this could constrain the ability of the university to
obtain economic and scientific benefits from further
developments.
Conclusions
The commercialisation of academic research by
spin-off creation has been a high policy priority in
many countries. Our detailed examination of the
phenomenon across several levels of analysis
stresses that spin-offs involve various objectives by
public research organisations, adopt different organisational support structures, take different forms and
appear in diverse institutional contexts.
Why create companies from research? There are
several answers to this question including: to contribute to national competitiveness, to create jobs locally,
to ensure a financial return for the university etc.
What kind of spin-offs do the public authorities
want to create? The answers are varied. We have
distinguished three types of ventures, but also various trajectories and development phases, various
kind of teams with a diversity of creators (such as
different academic or industrial experience).
In which kind of institutions are spin-offs created?
World-class large scientific universities, public research organisations which are focused on a specific
sector, ‘small’ universities without a strong research
specialism, and institutions with or without a TTO
and with different types of TTO do not generate the
same types of venture.
This heterogeneity of objectives, types of companies, teams, parent institutions and TTOs,
poses major challenges for the development and implementation of specific effective political tools and

Science and Public Policy March 2008

<-----Page 12----->University spin-off firms

schemes. However, many schemes have been introduced in the majority of countries with a significant
public scientific base. Despite the provision of substantial sums of support funding, the results across
Europe seem disappointing. This failed expectation
is, as we have shown in this paper, mainly linked, on
the one hand, to the fact that the difficulties which
are expected in the commercialisation of research
through the creation of spin-offs were certainly underestimated, and, on the other hand to the fact that
the multiple actors involved with this issue at the national, regional, institutional and spin-off firm levels
have experienced some difficulties in defining their
strategies.
Should a university be selective and choose to
support only one to two projects per year, which are
associated with star scientists and have strong
growth potential? Or should it encourage its young
students to create companies which expected to remain small service companies? Should the authorities which support them encourage the creation of
these companies or should they concentrate on their
development as many observers have proposed?
Both in universities and in national agencies or ministries, it seems that these choices are seldom, if
ever, made. The result appears to be that the public
authorities and the universities increase the budgets
intended for the transfer of technology through spinoffs because they do not want to make choices. But
the public authorities may also expect too much
from spin-offs (the vast majority of them remain
small companies) and from universities (they have
multiple missions and are in an environment which
is seldom favourable with marketing). To expect too
much is bound to lead to disappointment. At the
European level, pressures on public research centres
and universities to become more proactive in the
economic development of their regions are growing.
European policies foster the creation academic spinoffs with the idea that they will bring employment
and economic benefits to their local environments,
particularly in less developed regions. Our findings
propose a less optimistic, or at least a less mechanical, view.
Hence, faced with the heterogeneity of spin-offs,
TTOs, entrepreneurial teams, the dynamics of
venture development, and institutions and their objectives, public intervention needs to be more finegrained. Public policies need to be linked to the
objectives of the commercialisation of research (at
the national or the university level), to the type of

sums of support funding, the results

spin-offs that will be created, and the environments
in which the ventures emerge. All these elements
suggest a need for heterogeneous policy measures.
This poses major challenges for the centralised approach which characterises the majority of European
countries and suggests a more decentralised focus is
needed.
Notes
1. Although there is debate about the aims of national level initiatives and the growth of regional and European ones, the
national level was generally the engine of policy to encourage
spin-offs.
2. These six types of public finance support programmes are:
public fund, public/private equity fund, Small business investment company-type refinance schemes, guarantee schemes,
fiscal incentives, and incubation schemes.
3. Usually, neither the amount of capital is sufficient to play a role
in the market for ideas, nor do the human or technological resources show the intrinsic quality or quantity required to attract
different stakeholders. So, the question arises as to why these
companies will still attract a significant amount of capital at
start-up. An explanation is that the capital serves to value the
technology licensed or transferred from the university into the
start-up. Another explanation is that the capital is used as preseed money to test some assumptions behind the business
model. In both cases, the multiple that can be realised will not
be in line with that expected by an investment manager.
