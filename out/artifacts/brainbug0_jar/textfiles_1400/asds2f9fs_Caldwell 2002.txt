<-----Page 0----->Organizational Trustworthiness:
An International Perspective

ABSTRACT. Although trust has been widely
recognized as a vital component of relationships and
a critical element to the success of organizations,
the literature describing trust and trustworthiness
is known for its varying perspectives and its inconsistencies. Trustworthiness has been identified as
a condition precedent to the development of trust.
Building upon the established constructs of interpersonal trustworthiness, we propose a related model
containing the seven constructs of Competence,
Legal Compliance, Responsibility to Inform, Quality
Assurance, Procedural Fairness, Interactional Courtesy, and Financial Balance. Citing evidence from
trust-related literature, we identify the utility of these
seven constructs in encompassing organizational trustworthiness as a subjectively perceived aspect of
organizational effectiveness. We analyzed questionnaire data and conducted comparative world-region
analyses.

Introduction
The recent events surrounding the collapse of
the seventh largest company in the U.S., along
with the dismantling of the fifth largest U.S.
accounting firm suggests that we are in need
of understanding how organizational trust is
formed. Many Enron employees trusted the
company they worked for so much that they had
their entire life savings invested in it. As Enron’s
stock price plummeted from a high of $85 to
$0.25 many individuals and institutional investors
lost billions of dollars. The Justice Department
has opened a criminal investigation into Enron,
whose bankruptcy has put thousands of people
out of work, devastated many investors and
wiped out the pension plans of thousands of
employees. In addition, it has been alleged that
Enron management was involved in market
manipulation, during the California energy crisis,
in order to increase profits.
Stakeholders trusted not only that Enron was
providing accurate information regarding its
operations, but also trusted in the checks and
balances of nationally established audit standards
for insuring accurate reporting and interpreting
of data. Despite the fact that trust is considered
to be fundamental to the understanding of interpersonal and group behavior (Hosmer, 1995;
Hirsch, 1978) and the foundation upon which
societies are founded (Bok, 1978), some scholars
suggest that trust is at an all time low and is
needed now more than ever in interpersonal relationships and in organizations (Reina and Reina,
1999).
This decline in trust should come as no
surprise as we hear about cases such as Enron,
the Ford Explorer/Bridgestone-Firestone tires

roll-over problems, nicotine spiking of cigarettes,
and other examples that are becoming increasingly common. Who do individuals trust and
why do individuals trust them? This question is
important not only for American business leaders
to understand, but for leaders in a global
economy.
The interactions of individuals and groups
creates social relationships. Social relationships are
constantly shifting as a result of adaptation to
individuals’ perceptual experiences within the
milieu of human interactions. Trust is an essential aspect of the adaptive process; indeed, trust
is the very fabric which holds our society
together. The adaptive process involves the assessment of trustworthiness of individuals, institutions, and organizations that are a part of the
social network. The perception of trustworthiness is based upon the observed behaviors of
others (Mayer et al., 1995; Caldwell and Jeffries,
2001; Caldwell et al., 2001).
The assessment of trustworthiness often occurs
through repetitive interactions where individuals
form opinions and adjust not only their own
behaviors but, where possible, the nature of the
relationships network1. It is intuitively obvious
that interactions occur among individuals, yet we
form trustworthiness opinions about institutions
and organizations as well. While an individual
may not be fully aware of the dynamics involved
in an interaction with another individual, at the
very least, there is a recognizable entity with
which one is dealing.
How so for an organization? Barnard (1938)
defines an organization as “a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces of two or
more persons” (p. 81). While an organization
may be recognized as distinct and unique, we
cannot touch or see it. As Barnard (1938)
describes, “sometimes physical things, persons,
statements, etc., serve to define or locate an
organization, just as magnets and affected metals
define or locate magnetic fields” (p. 76). In other
words, individuals form their perceptions about
organizations based upon information about
the organization and experiences with the
organization that might include such things
as interactions with employees and product/
service purchases. Within the context of

Barnard’s definition and description of organizations we can begin to explore organizational
trustworthiness.
The purpose of this paper is to build upon
the current literature to present a model of organizational trustworthiness that offers testable
criteria upon which to measure this important
construct. Given the recent history of the Enron
case, with its accompanying embarrassing impact
upon Arthur Andersen and the entire investment
community, perhaps there is no more important
time for organizational leaders to understand
the factors that make up organizational trustworthiness.
In this paper Section one will provide a brief
overview of the definitions of trust and trustworthiness and will provide a context in which
organizational trustworthiness logically fits.
Section two will then present a seven factor
model for organizational trustworthiness, briefly
defining how this model relates to the classic
three factor model of interpersonal trustworthiness established by Mayer et al. (1995). Section
three will return to the academic literature to
demonstrate that our seven factor model has
a sound theoretical footing. Section four will
briefly discuss Hofstede’s cross-cultural perspective and develop hypotheses. Section five and six
will identify the data and discuss analyses and
results. Section seven discusses the findings and
the final section presents limitations and future
research.

Definitions of trust and trustworthiness
The academic literature about trust has
historically been described as “a paradox”
(Golembiewski and McConkie, 1975, p. 131), “a
confusing pot pourri of definitions” (Shapiro,
1987, p. 624), and limited by “a lack of conceptual clarity” (Bluhm, 1987, p. 334). Trust and
trustworthiness are constructs that are commonly
interchanged as if they were the same concept
(Caldwell and Jeffries, 2001), and a multitude of
definitions and approaches from a diversity of
perspectives have been offered to provide insight
into the field (Hosmer, 1995). The interchange
of trust and trustworthiness is most likely due to

<-----Page 2----->Organizational Trustworthiness
the cheek-by-jowl relationship of the constructs.
While it is difficult to imagine one without the
other, we will attempt to define each and discuss
their interrelatedness.
“Trust is an expression of faith and confidence
that a person or an institution will be fair,
reliable, ethical, competent, and nonthreatening”
(Carnevale, 1995, p. xi). If you close your eyes
and fall backward into another’s arms, you trust
that individual has the desire to catch you, they
have the strength to catch you and they will not
move away from your fall. Certainly, the act of
closing one’s eyes and falling is a risk; it is giving
up control of where and how you land. Two
soldiers walking down a trail in enemy territory,
each carefully scanning one side of the trail and
putting their life in the hands of the other.
Soldiers trust that their comrades have the ability
to spot the enemy, have the fire-power to divert
an attack, and will make the right response if an
enemy is encountered. These examples illustrate
that “the context of the relationship will affect
both the need for trust and the evaluation of
trustworthiness” (Mayer et al., 1995, p. 727). The
act of trusting is a temporal phenomenon since
it is based on experiences, interactions, and perceptions of others, organizations and institutions.
Trust is an attitude reflecting a willingness to
assume a risk and relinquish control in the hope
of receiving a desired benefit.
As Mayer et al. noted, ability, benevolence,
and integrity are each important to trust, “and
each may vary independently of the others”
(Mayer et al., 1995, p. 720). Caldwell and Jeffries
(2001) noted that the three elements in the
Mayer et al. model are subjectively perceived by
each individual – and that each person’s individual lens contains an ethical filter and a set of
core beliefs that form the basis of one’s frame of
reference and unique perceptual paradigm. As a
dyadic relationship, interpersonal trust is “determined by contextual factors such as the stakes
involved, the balance of power in the relationship, the perception of the level of risk, and the
alternatives available to the trustor” (Mayer et al.,
1995, pp. 726–727). Similarly, “the context of
the relationship will affect both the need for trust
and the evaluation of trustworthliness” (Mayer et
al., 1995, p. 727).

351

Carnevale et al. (1982, p. 13) affirmed the
ethical nature of the individual lens, described by
Caldwell and Jeffries in describing trust as “a
concomitant expectation that the other (in a relationship) will reciprocate”. Hosmer also emphasized the ethical elements of trust and identified
ten ethical principles as the decision rules that
impact the trust decision (Hosmer, 1995).
Similarly, Caroll (1996) listed fourteen ethical
frameworks or principles as the lenses through
which individuals interpret the world. The
elements of one’s ethical lens are derived from
the set of core beliefs – about self, others, the
past, current reality, and the future – that
Caldwell et al. (2000) called the Five Beliefs
Model (cf. Senge, 1990; Sehein, 1985).
Trustworthiness is the antecedent accumulated
perceptual experiences that lead one to trust
another person, institution, or organization.
Caldwell and Jeffries (2001, p. 6) defined interpersonal trustworthiness as “the subjectively
perceived point on a continuum at which an
individual’s behaviors are perceived as complying
with the ethical duties considered to be owed to
the person who is making the decision to trust.”
Interpersonal trustworthiness is individually
determined and based upon each individual’s
ethical perceptions regarding the duties to which
he or she is owed by the person whose objective behaviors are being observed. As noted by
Caldwell and Jeffries (2001), the subjective nature
of the interpersonal trustworthiness process helps
to explain why two people may differ in interpreting whether or not the observed person is
one to trust.
Describing trust in terms of one’s ethical perceptions, Hosmer (1995, p. 389) defined trust as
“the result of a given decision or action that recognizes and protects the rights and interests of
other people through an application of the ethical
principles of analysis.” We suggest that the trust
decision described by Hosmer is based upon the
subjective perceptions of each individual, and that
it is a product of their individual lens. Figure 1
illustrates the relationships between the objective behavior, the perceptual lens, perceived trustworthiness, and the decision or attitude to trust
(Caldwell and Jeffries, 2001).

Figure 1. Trustworthiness and the mediating lens.

Organizational trustworthiness
Trustworthiness as an organizational construct is
closely related to interpersonal trustworthiness.
Hosmer defined trust as “the exception by one
person, group, or firm of ethically justifiable
behavior – that is, morally correct decisions and
actions based upon ethical principles of analysis
– on the part of the other person, group, or firm
in a joint endeavor or economic exchange”
(1995, p. 399). Though Scott (1987) would
contend that organization members – not organizations – are the ones who trust, we concur
with Hosmer that trust can be extended to individuals, to groups, and to organizations of various
types – and that many organization types can
possess express or implied duties and be expected
to be trustworthy.
Just as interpersonal trustworthiness involves
a set of personal and ethical duties perceived as
owed to another person, organizational trustworthiness incorporates a related but uniquely
different set of duties. In describing the nature
of duties, Solomon (1993) noted that duties are
defined by one’s role and carry a moral weight,
even when they are not explicitly articulated.
Duties, according to Solomon (1993, p. 163) are
more specific than generalized “obligations” or
“responsibilities” but are “ground-level, rolespecific aspects of one’s position” that carry the
burden of honoring both specific and general
ethical imperatives. At the organizational level,
duties require the ability to serve a multitude of
stakeholders while balancing each duty within
the larger organizational and community setting.

Caldwell et al. (2001) have identified a set of
seven duties that are commonly owed in the
human resource management selection process
that represented a model of organizational level
trustworthiness. The duties that they listed in
their study of public sector assessment centers
include the following seven elements:
Competence – Competence includes the level
of knowledge and ability to achieve results
associated with the purposes of an organization.
Quality Assurance – Quality assurance addresses
the extent to which standards of quality are
understood and adhered to on a continuous
basis to achieve desired outcomes.
Interactional Courtesy – Interactional courtesy
encompasses the degree of respect and
courtesy shown to others in performing
organizational duties.
Procedural Fairness – Procedural fairness
includes the extent to which stakeholders
are given the opportunity to participate in
fair processes and systems associated with
the formal and informal practices of the
organization.
Responsibility to Inform – Responsibility to
inform incorporates the level of communication provided to stakeholders who have
an interest in organization objectives and
outcomes.
Legal Compliance – Legal compliance refers to
the degree to which applicable laws are
understood and followed.
Financial Balance – Financial balance includes

<-----Page 4----->Organizational Trustworthiness
the ability of the organization to achieve
both efficiency and effectiveness in accomplishing organizational results.
Although Caldwell et al. (2001) defined these
seven duties in terms of the human resource profession, we suggest that these duties make up a
comprehensive model of the elements of organizational trustworthiness – and that they are
directly comparable to the Mayer et al. (1995)
model of interpersonal trustworthiness. Table I
briefly summarizes the relationships that we
suggest are similar in the seven elements of organizational trustworthiness with the three factors
of interpersonal trustworthiness:
As noted by this table, the seven elements in
the Caldwell et al. (2001) set of organizational
duties parallel the three factors of ability, benevolence, and integrity of interpersonal trustworthiness.

Theoretical and conceptual connections
Affective component
Several scholars have presented key ideas that
reinforce the theoretical and conceptual connections between interpersonal and organizational
trustworthiness. McAllister (1995) noted that
interpersonal trust contains both an affective and

353

a cognitive component, and that these components are closely related. Williams (2001) noted
that people’s perceptions about their interdependence with other groups influence their beliefs
about group members’ trustworthiness and their
affect for group members. Fiske and Taylor
(1991) confirmed that developing trust and cooperation across organization boundaries can be difficult because differing organizations typically
have conflicting goals. Williams (2001, p. 378)
noted that trust development is affected by group
association between two diverse groups because
people are “likely to hold positive perceptions
of fellow group members’ trustworthiness and
exhibit cooperative behavior toward them” (c.f.
Brewer and Kramer, 1995). Brewer and Miller
(1996) noted, however that people who have
little common association experience “out-group
effects” in which members of low contact groups
are perceived as less trustworthy than their own
members. Some studies note that dissimilar
groups – including culturally diverse as well as
functionally or demographically different categories – view members of contrasting groups
with distrust and suspicion (Thilbeault and Kelly,
1991). Other research suggests that dissimilar
professional groups can develop rapid trust when
working on joint projects (Meyerson et al.,
1996). However, Williams (2001) noted that confidence, associated with professional certification,
can generate positive beliefs about another

group’s trustworthiness. Lewicki and Bunker
(1996) confirm that the trustworthiness of others
is increased by interacting with them over an
extended period of time. Mayer and Davis (1999)
determined that in the performance appraisal
process that employees who felt treated by
persons high in ability, benevolence, and integrity
were equated with an increased propensity to
trust.
These findings suggest that trustworthiness has
a highly affective component – a point emphasized by McAllister (1995). Pennings and
Woiceshyn (1987) found that people make emotional investments in trust relationships, express
genuine care and concern for the welfare of
partners, believe in the value of such relationships, and believe that these sentiments are
reciprocated. Ultimately, the emotional ties
linking individuals can provide the basis for trust.
The emphasis on benevolence by Mayer et al.
(1995) at the individual level corresponds, of
course, to this affective trust.
Correspondingly, organizational level trustworthiness – typified by interactional courtesy,
procedural fairness, and the responsibility to
inform – also has a distinct affective element.
Tyler et al. (1997) incorporate within their definition of procedural justice elements of trustworthiness, benevolence, and the sharing of
information. Butler and Cantrell (1984) describe
trustworthiness as demonstrating loyalty to the
interests of another individual. Kouzes and
Posner (1993) equated trustworthiness in organizations with the dedication to another’s welfare,
growth, and wholeness. They note that organizations that create systems that demonstrate
dedication, receive a corresponding increase in
trust from their employees, as well as higher performance and greater employee loyalty. Tepper et
al. (2001) found that Organizational Citizenship
Behavior (OCB) – behavior that reflects the
highest level of personal commitment to organizations and their goals – was directly related to
procedural justice conditions. Similarly, CoyleShapiro and Kessler (2000) found that employee
commitment and a willingness to engage in OCB
behaviors was reduced when procedural fairness
decreased.
From an affective trust standpoint, it seems

clear that the theoretical and conceptual literature strongly reinforces the relationship between
organizational trustworthiness and the elements
of procedural fairness, interactional courtesy, and
the responsibility to inform that we propose in
our model.

Cognitive component
Costigan et al. (1998) emphasized that trust and
trustworthiness consist of a cognitive side that
pertains to the rational decision to trust or to
withhold trust. McAllister (1995) also noted that
trust and trustworthiness have a strong cognitive
element. McAllister stressed that “reliability and
dependability” were the key elements of cognitive interpersonal trust. Relating that trust to
the organizational setting, McAllister wrote
that competence and responsibility were key
elements. According to McAllister, the competence of an individual or an organizational made
it possible for others to consider them trustworthy in terms of the ability to count on the
performance of the person or group.
In writing about the cognitive rationale of
trust decisions, Lewis and Wiegert (1985, p. 970)
explained “we choose whom we will trust in
which respects and under what circumstances,
and we base the choice on what we take to
be ‘good reasons,’ constituting evidence of
trustworthiness.” This contextually contingent
approach to trustworthiness not only reinforces
the importance of the cognitive nature of organizational trustworthiness but corresponds well
with the Caldwell and Jeffries (2001) model of
the individual perceptual lens.
The cognitive-based elements of organizational
trustworthiness that predict reliability and consistency are competence, quality assurance, financial balance, and legal compliance. Steel and
Lloyd (1988) found that involvement in quality
improvement programs tended to have a positive
impact on interpersonal trust. A study of organizations in France by Hancke (1998) confirmed
that companies that followed quality improvement practices also strengthened their trust
relationship. Seiders and Berry (1998) noted
that service quality was equated with organiza-

<-----Page 6----->Organizational Trustworthiness
tional trustworthiness as well as the fairness
of the organization. La Berge and Svendsen
(2001) identified six features of quality improvement programs that strengthen organizational
trust.
Covey (1990) noted that competence was a
foundation element of both interpersonal and
organizational trustworthiness. Competence and
reliability – fundamental factors in cognitivebased trust – are two of the five dimensions of a
model for organizational trust recommended by
Shockley-Zalabak et al. (2001). Nooteboom
(1999) noted that perceived competence not only
lowered transaction costs but increased trust levels
in inter-firm research projects. Madhavan and
Grover (1998) found that companies that developed shared competence by co-locating and
exchanging personnel on inter-firm projects
increased mutual trust.
Financial balance – or the combining of
outcomes that are both efficient and effective –
was shown by Berman (1997) to increase resident
trust in local governments. Collins and Porras
(1994) and their study of outstanding businesses
of the past fifty years, noted that a common
quality of these businesses in creating both
internal organizational trust and the trust of the
general public was their ability to balance profitability and a commitment to organizational core
values – and that financial success was balanced
with a commitment to those values. Pfeffer’s
(1998) extensive research also found that high
performance organizations were both more profitable and more committed to the welfare of their
employees than comparable organizations – reinforcing the importance of financial balance in
creating not only trustworthiness but also greater
organizational wealth.
Legal compliance is related to integrity to the
degree that individuals and organizations that
adhere to prevailing laws avoid legal conflicts and
demonstrate their technical understanding of
societal demands (Caldwell et al., 2001). Carroll
(1996) reviewed the importance of legal compliance as an indicator of ethical commitment
and trustworthiness in his discussion of immoral,
amoral, and moral management. Citing the
example of Sears Roebuck & Co. in 1992,
Carroll noted:

355

In the face of declining revenues and a shrinking
market share, Sears’ executives put into place new
goals, quotas, and incentives for auto center service
personnel. Service employees were told to meet
product-specific and service-specific quotas – sell so
many brake jobs, batteries, and front-end alignments
– or face consequences such as reduced working
hours or transfers. Some employees spoke of the
“pressure” they felt to generate business. Although
Sears’ executives did not set out to defraud customers, they put into place a commission system
that led to Sears’ employees feeling pressure to sell
products and services that consumers did not need.
Soon after the complaints against Sears occurred,
CEO Edward Brennan acknowledged that management had created an environment in which mistakes
were made, although no intent to deceive consumers had existed (Carroll, 1996, p. 127)

The complaints resulted in attorney generals
in 40 states accusing Sears Roebuck & Co. of
misleading customers and selling them unneeded
parts and services. In describing the three perceptions of obligations to legal compliance of
immoral, amoral, and moral companies, Carroll
noted that a moral company would pursue obedience toward the letter and the spirit of the law
and would view it as a minimal standard of
ethical behavior – preferring to operate well
above legal mandates. In contrasts, immoral companies would view the law as a barrier to
overcome and amoral companies would ask,
“What can we do legally?” (Carroll, 1996). In
response to observed behaviors of commitment
to legal compliance, both individuals and organizations would perceive the moral philosophy as
most trustworthy.
Factors that determine whether an individual
or an organization are likely to be trusted based
upon their reliability and predictability are largely
related to ability at the interpersonal level. We
posit that cognitive-based trustworthiness at the
organization level is likely to be based upon the
perception of competence, financial balance, and
quality assurance. Our model of trustworthiness
suggests that integrity at the interpersonal level
equates with legal compliance.
We argue that the elements of legal compliance and procedural fairness of organizational
trustworthiness match well with the integrity of

<-----Page 7----->356

Cam Caldwell and Stephen E. Clapham

interpersonal trustworthiness identified by Mayer
et al. (1995). Elements of cognitive-based and
affect-based trust identified as a key part of trust
and trustworthiness (Jeffries and Reed, 2000;
McAllister, 1995; Williams, 2001) are integrated
with both organizational and interpersonal trustworthiness.
We defined organizational trustworthiness as
“the subjectively perceived point on a continuum
at which a group or organization’s behaviors
are perceived as complying with the ethical
duties considered to be owed to the person or
organization who is making the decision to
trust.” The parallel of this definition with the
previously provided definition of interpersonal
trustworthiness is intentional. The following
figure reflects our model of organizational trustworthiness.
We suggest that the subjective individual
lens identified by Caldwell and Jeffries (2001)
at the individual level applies in interpreting
the perceived trustworthiness of organizations
and groups – based upon the seven elements
of our model – just as ability, benevolence,
and integrity are interpreted as part of the subjective lens in the Caldwell and Jeffries (2001)
model.

Cross-cultural perspective
There is considerable evidence of cross-cultural
differences in values. Hofstede (1980, 1991,
1994, 2001) has written extensively about the
impact of cultural factors on differences in values
and individual perceptions. Hofstede investigated
differences in values in fifty different countries
between 1967 and 1978. Through his early
studies he identified four interpersonal dimensions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance,
individualism and masculinity (Hofstede, 1980).
He has since added an additional dimension he
refers to as “Confucian or time-oriented”
(Hofstede, 2001). These five dimensions are
useful to describe general differences in attitudes
and values between different cultures: (1)
Individualism-Collectivism: individualism and
collectivism refer to the degree that members of
a society give precedence to the individual or the
group; (2) Power Distance: power distance has to
do with the degree to which unequal distribution of power and wealth is accepted in society;
(3) Uncertainty Avoidance: uncertainty avoidance reflects the way in which different societies
deal with uncertainty about the future and the
need for control; (4) Masculinity-Femininity:
masculine cultures tend to focus on task achievement, goal-accomplishment, assertiveness, and
self-interest. Feminine cultures are more likely to
emphasize relationship development, preservation

Figure 2. Organizational Trustworthiness.

<-----Page 8----->Organizational Trustworthiness
of quality of life, and creating harmoniously
functioning organizations; (5) Confucian or
Time-Oriented: Confucian or time-oriented
designations refer to the degree that organizations
distinguish between a long-term and short-term
orientation toward life and work. Hofstede notes
that the dimensions are useful to characterize
groups but should not be applied to the more
micro individual level of analysis (Hofstede,
2001). Hofstede et al. (1990) concluded that
organizational values are determined primarily
by the larger societal culture. The value of
Hofstede’s model is that it provides insights that
can be useful in inferring likelihoods or patterns
of behavior that may aid understanding in
attempts to bridge cultural paradigms. Hofstede’s
five-dimension framework can be conceptually
useful to develop hypotheses regarding the seven
dimensions we purport help determine organizational trustworthiness.
We will examine differences among the seven
theorized dimensions between North Americans
and Asians. Previous research has found that
North Americans are high in individualism, low
in power distance, medium in uncertainty avoidance, high in masculine values, and short-term
oriented. Asians are low in individualism (i.e.,
emphasize collectivism), high and low in power
distance, high and low in uncertainty avoidance,
masculine and feminine values, and long-term
oriented (Hofstede, 2001), thus:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): North Americans will
perceive “competence” as more important
that East Asians in their perception of organizational trust.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): There will be no difference
between North Americans and East Asians
in the perceived importance of “quality
assurance” as it relates to the perception of
organizational trust.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): North Americans will
perceive “interactional courtesy” as less
important than East Asians in their perception of organizational trust.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): North Americans will
perceive “procedural fairness” as more
important than will East Asians in their perception of organizational trust.

357

Hypothesis 5 (H5): North Americans will
perceive “responsibility to inform” as more
important than East Asians in their perception of organizational trust.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): North Americans will
perceive “legal compliance” as more important than East Asians in their perception of
organizational trust.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): There will be no difference
between North Americans and East Asians
in the perceived importance of “financial
balance” as it relates to the perception of
organizational trust.

Respondents and measures
As discussed in the theory section, we suggested
that organizational trust can be measured with
seven dimensions: competence, quality assurance,
interactional courtesy, procedural fairness,
responsibility to inform, legal compliance, and
financial balance. A thirty-five item questionnaire
was developed with these dimensions in mind. A
seven-point Likert scale was used: very strongly
agree (1), strongly agree (2), agree (3), neutral
(4), disagree (5), strongly disagree (6), and very
strongly disagree (7). Respondents were asked to
think about the factors that they considered
being important in a highly trustworthy organization (see appendix). Respondents were asked
to indicate their opinions about each of the items
by circling a number from 1 to 7.
We conducted the survey at three different
universities in the United States. Respondents
were 339 part-time MBA students, 190 men and
149 women. Thirty-six per cent of the students
were under twenty-five years of age while sixtyfour per cent were twenty-six years of age and
older. Two respondents were from Africa; fortythree were from East Asia (Taiwan [70%],
Thailand [4%], Hong Kong [4%], and People
Republic of China [22%]); five were from
Europe; four were from the Middle East & North
Africa; 273 were from North America (United
States [99.6%] and Canada [0.04%]); five were
from Latin America & the Carribbean; and seven
respondents did not indicate region of citizenship. 242 of the respondents had undergraduate

<-----Page 9----->358

degrees in business and ninety-seven had undergraduate degrees in other areas.

Results
To evaluate the extent to which respondents
grouped dimensions (factors) from the 35 item
questionnaire (5 items per dimension), a factor
analysis was conducted. Applying the minimum
eigenvalue of 1.00 criterion, six factors were
extracted. Factors were then rotated using the
varimax (orthogonal) technique. A scree plot was
also analyzed. The resulting factor structure coefficients are presented in Table II. Six factors
accounted for 60.1 per cent of the variance. In
interpreting the rotated factor pattern, an item
was said to load on a given dimension if the
factor loading was 0.40 or greater for that dimension, and was less than 0.40 for the others
(Stevens, 1986). Since three items violated the
preceding criteria, they were scratched from
further analyses. Eleven items retained meaningful loadings on Factor 1, which we will refer
to as the “honest communication” dimension.
Four items loaded on factor 2, which we refer
to as “interactional courtesy.” Four items loaded
on factor 3; we refer to that factor as the “quality
assurance” dimension. Four items loaded on
factor 4; we refer to that dimension as “task competence.” Four items loaded on factor 5; we refer
to that dimension as “financial balance.” Five
items loaded on factor 6; we refer to that dimension as “legal compliance.” Dimension scores
were then created for each respondent by adding
together item scores that loaded on each of the
six dimensions. Dimension reliability was assessed
by calculating coefficient alphas (Cronbach,
1951) (see Table II).
To examine differences in dimension scores
across regions, a one-way between groups
MANOVA was conducted. Because sample size
for the world regions of Africa, Europe, Latin
America & the Caribbean, and the Middle East
& North Africa were too small, they were not
included in the analyses. Therefore, the independent variable for these analyses included the
world regions of North America and East Asia.
The dependent variables include the six dimen-

sions identified through factor analysis. The
MANOVA revealed significant multivariate
effect for world region, Wilks’ lambda = 0.95,
F(6, 310) = 2.99; p = 0.008. Further analyses,
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
were conducted on each of the six dimensions.
Mean dimension by region scores are presented
in Table III. These analyses revealed significant
effects for three dimensions: dimension 1,
“honest communication,” F(1, 317) = 12.77,
p = 0.00; dimension 4, “task competence,”
F(1, 317) = 4.20, p = 0.02; and dimension 6,
“financial balance,” F(1, 317) = 4.21, p = 0.01.
A summary ANOVA table is presented in
Table IV.

Discussion
The factor structure found in the present study
shows a remarkably close approximation of the
theorized dimensions. While we theorized seven
dimensions, this study has indicated six clearly
identifiable dimensions: honest communication,
task competence, quality assurance, interactional
courtesy, legal compliance, and financial balance.
Honest communication appears to be a melding
of the procedural fairness and responsibility
to inform dimensions. We defined procedural
fairness in terms of stakeholders opportunities to
participate in fair processes and systems of the
organization, and we defined responsibility to
inform in terms of the level of communication
provided to stakeholders. As defined, procedural
fairness and responsibility to inform could be
conceptualized as one dimension. If stakeholders
have the opportunity to participate in fair
processes they are likely to perceive that they are
being heard and that the organization cares about
what they have to say. In addition, if participation is encouraged, it makes sense that individuals are informed for input to be meaningful.
The responsibility to inform dimension could be
viewed in terms of the extent to which stakeholders are given the opportunity for participation in the communication process. Hence, a
confluence of the two dimensions. On the other
hand, it could be that the questionnaire items are
not yet crafted to capture the distinctions that

may be present. Further work needs to be carried
out to provide greater reliance on this instrument
to measure the dimensions of organizational trust.
This study has provided support for our model
of organizational trust. Overall dimension mean
scores indicate that each dimension is viewed as
important in creating the perception of organizational trust.
We hypothesized that North Americans would
consider task competence, procedural fairness,
responsibility to inform, and legal compliance to
be more important in their perceptions of
organizational trustworthiness than East Asians.
We further hypothesized that North Americans
would consider interpersonal courtesy as less
important than East Asians in their perceptions
of organizational trustworthiness. The findings
suggest that North Americans do consider competence, honest communication (procedural
fairness and responsibility to inform), and legal
compliance to be more important than East
Asians in forming their perceptions of trust.
However, our findings suggest that North

Americans also consider interactional courtesy to
be more important than East Asians.
Research has found that North Americans are
more comfortable with impersonal organizations
that encourage individual initiative; are more
likely to regard one another as equal in power;
have a low preference for rules and regulations,
more decentralized; are assertive with an intense
motivation to achieve; and seek immediate
outcomes and results (Hofstede, 2001). The
findings in this study suggest that there is an
overall higher threshold that organizations
must meet in order to gain the trust of North
Americans. In order to meet the higher expectations for immediate outcomes organizations
must develop a high level of competency. If
immediate outcomes are not in evidence, the
findings suggest that North Americans lose trust
in the organization.
Recent events in the United States have cast
a shadow of mistrust over the entire investment
community. This has resulted from the failure to
provide honest communication to stakeholders.
Our findings suggest that organizations that
provide access to accurate, honest information are
more likely to be trusted.
East Asians favor more personal organizations
that encourage loyalty, duty, and group participation; are more likely to regard one another as
equal in power; prefer written rules and regulations; feel more comfortable in an environment
where interpersonal support and work are valued;
and are patient with a lower expectation for
immediate results (Hofstede, 2001). Collectivist
societies value harmony with emotional dependence on belonging in tight social frameworks.
Within this context we hypothesized that East
Asians would expect a greater degree of interactional courtesy than North Americans. Our
results did not find a significant difference
between North Americans and East Asians and
the direction was not as expected. This could
indicate that East Asians have a higher level of
tolerance for less courteous behavior. Loyalty,
duty and the desire for interpersonal support
could all contribute to this higher level of tolerance. This suggests the organizations are not
likely to lose trust of East Asians simply because
they are less courteous.

<-----Page 12----->Organizational Trustworthiness
Since East Asians are more comfortable with
rules and regulations, we hypothesized that legal
compliance would be less important to them than
to North Americans. Our results have found
support for this hypothesis. Disputes are handled
less formally in East Asia and often do not end
up in the court system. In addition, more rules
and regulations mean less uncertainty and since
most East Asians are comfortable living in a more
rigid rule run society, where fewer disputes arise.
Hence, less focus or concern about legal compliance. The North American society is a more
litigious society with fewer rules. Ambiguity
could lead to more disputes and a greater propensity to resolve in the court system. Hence, in
North America, there is a greater focus and
reliance on the legal system.

Limitations and future research
Some limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, respondents of the questionnaire
were MBA students in the United States. We did
not collect information regarding the length of
time foreign students had been in the United
States, nor did we gather information regarding
their association with North American firms in
their own country. A significant amount of time
in North America or association with North
American Firms prior to entry into the MBA
program could have influenced their responses to
the questionnaire.
Second, because of small sample sizes we were
only able to conduct a comparative analysis
between two regions of the world. Hofstede’s
cultural dimensions are more country specific.
The East Asian countries we have grouped
together all fall within the same cultural dimension quadrants, identified by Hofstede, with one
exception; on the masculine/feminine dimension, Hong Kong tends to be masculine with
weak uncertainty avoidance, while the other
countries tend to be feminine with strong uncertainty avoidance. Since a majority of our East
Asian respondents were from Taiwan, we felt this
one difference was not a large enough influence
to skew our results. However, it is always risky
to generalize even to small groups much less to

361

regions of the world. So, generalizability of these
findings to other groups cannot be determined
on the basis on one study. Nonetheless, we feel
that the quantity and quality of the data are sufficiently high as to provide initial insight into a
much needed area.
Future research of individual countries, rather
than regions, could help organizations understand
the areas of emphasis that can best bring about
an environment of trust.

Note

In this article we are mostly concerned about social
networks. We recognize that there are those occasions
where the decision to trust must be made immediately without prior interactions (e.g., if you are
hanging from a cliff and an unknown person extends
their hand to pull you off ). Meyerson et al. (1996)
refer to this aspect of trust as “swift trust”.
