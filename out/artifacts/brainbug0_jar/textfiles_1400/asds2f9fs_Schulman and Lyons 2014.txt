New Frontiers of the Innovation Economy
and Education
Abstract: The global recession of 2008 has created lingering economic uncertainty
and the necessity for innovative thinking and action. Workforce development, with
its focus on massification and replication needs to incorporate entrepreneurial
innovation and development to scale while disruptive innovation provides the
stimulus that animates and drives the model. Education at the university level,
entrepreneurship education in particular, needs to examine both new models and
new types of students, because acting entrepreneurially is not just for entrepreneurs but for everybody. The model presented in this commentary is an attempt to
focus on the processes and linkages between the various “actors” that define the
disparate relationships and opportunities described in this commentary.
Historically, entrepreneurship and workforce development have been
viewed as separate, often conflicting priorities, frequently competing for scarce
resources in the landscape of economic development. Although both entrepreneurship and workforce development bring resources and add value to the
community economy and share common roots in education and training, there
has been little current research that examines how they can be leveraged
together to provide new models for economic development and innovation
that accelerate growth, while providing for a vibrant economic future for our
communities and nation via well-educated, nascent entrepreneurs.

representation and is an attempt to focus on the processes and linkages between
the various “actors” that define the disparate relationships and opportunities
described in this commentary.
Historically, entrepreneurship and workforce development have been
viewed as separate, often conflicting priorities, frequently competing for scarce
resources in the landscape of economic development. Although both entrepreneurship and workforce development bring resources and add value to the
community economy and share common roots in education and training, there
has been little current research that examines how they can be leveraged
together to provide new models for economic development, innovation, and
accelerate growth, while providing for a vibrant economic future for our communities and nation via well-educated, nascent entrepreneurs.

Toward an entrepreneurial workforce
Workforce development attempts to build/enhance a region’s economic prosperity and stability by focusing on the creation of a skilled workforce and matching
that workforce with employment opportunities. It is often a demand-based
(employer) effort to match employment demand, through certification and education, with a skilled workforce that corresponds to that demand. In this respect,
traditional workforce development has been problem focused (Blakely and Leigh
2010). Consequently, workforce development has expanded beyond notions of
employment, training and development to deal with such issues as transportation and human service support (Giloth 2000).
Two major strands of workforce development are sector-based and placebased programs (Conway et al. 2007). Sector-based programs consider the
demand-side of both industry and workers with specific training and education
provided to workers for particular regional industries/services. Place-based programs are designed to meet ABE (Adult Basic Education) needs of the participant
and facilitate rapid placement into the workforce. Although usually at an entry
level, these jobs, too, are tied to local employers who determine what types of
skills/competencies they are seeking (Bloom and Riccio 2005).
The expansion of the knowledge-based economy with its increasing skills
level has left many low-wage workers outside the new job market (Katz and
Kreuger 1999). This has led to various attempts to blend sector- and place-based
approaches into new models, often with a greater emphasis on education and a
recognition that workforce programs need to work more closely within the
context of neighborhood and community economic development. Community

colleges have emerged as catalysts in these emerging partnerships. This is
understandable because of their existing partnerships with local industry and
their ability to respond more quickly to changing needs (Ruhe 2013).
This increasingly demand-side driven need for greater preparation in technical skills, critical thinking, technology, and problem-solving skills has led to
an accelerating disconnect with the supply-side of workforce development. In
response, some private sector employers dealing with the skills gap have developed initiatives like Microsoft’s “Employability, Entrepreneurship and Workforce
Development program” that seeks to both leverage the workforce to increase
productivity by “allocating workers” to higher value activities and to build
“regional capacity for entrepreneurship” to drive sustainable growth. Their
vision is to accomplish these goals through a fundamental education based on
twenty-first century learning skills that focuses on employability and entrepreneurship as key strategic elements to both education and life choices made by
the learner (Microsoft 2011a, 2).
Microsoft is not alone in this approach that envisions a causal relationship
between entrepreneurship and employment. A number of empirical studies have
demonstrated the link between unemployment and entrepreneurship (Audretsch,
Carree, and Thurik 2001) suggesting that higher levels of unemployment will lead to
an increase in start-up activity based on decreased opportunity costs in launching a
business enterprise (Dixon and Clifford 2007). However, Microsoft and other employers view this as a flexible, permeable arrangement, with the employee becoming an
entrepreneur, seeking re-employment, and creating new entrepreneurial opportunities as a life process and journey rather than as a singular discrete activity.
As Thom Ruhe (2013) has stated,
Workforce needs to be redefined … as part of a larger academic reform … this is what large
employers want-skills coupled with the ability to think and be an innovator … an entrepreneurial mindset will propel people to consider a trajectory to their craft, allowing them
to leverage the labor and output of others, to a scale that will generate greater wealth for
themselves and employment opportunities for others…This is about making sure that
everyone regardless of background, education level, interest, at least perceives the opportunity to be Entrepreneurial. It is about democratizing access to entrepreneurship. And by
doing so, we will unlock the key to our nation’s economic prosperity.
(Ruhe 2013)

Entrepreneurship and innovation
The primary role that Schumpeter (Herbert and Link 1989) assigned to entrepreneurs is the ability to convert a new idea or invention into a successful innovation. As an agent of change and innovation, entrepreneurship is not solely about

141

a choice of occupation or about ownership. It is fundamentally dynamic and
does not simply involve entrants to a market that is fundamentally the same
year after year (Glaeser, Rosenthal, and Strange 2009).
Schumpeter also posited that entrepreneurship results not only in new
industries but also in new combinations of existing inputs/industries. To
Schumpeter, the entrepreneur is not the bearer of risk. That is the role of the
investor/capitalist. Drucker (1985) adds that entrepreneurs do not necessarily
create change but find opportunities created by change. Thus, they are not
passive players buffeted by existing markets; they create new markets by embracing change. Also, entrepreneurship can be defined as the pursuit of opportunity
without regard to resources currently controlled, an acknowledgement that
entrepreneurs build crucial networks that bring the resources of others to bear
on achieving their business goals (Gartner and Baker 2010). Casson (1982) has
identified five facets of entrepreneurship: self-employment, small firms, ownership, entry, and innovation. These narrow definitions often exclude activities
and interactions. Unlike the metric driven parameters of workforce development,
measuring the economic aspects of entrepreneurship is often difficult (Glaeser,
Rosenthal, and Strange 2009).
Entrepreneurship may result in new organizations or in the revitalization of
organizations in response to a perceived opportunity (Shane 2003).
Entrepreneurship has been identified as a major driver of economic growth in
both the United States and Western Europe. Although entrepreneurship and
entrepreneurs often seem to have been “…significantly influenced by features
of their local economies, and they have often influenced the fates of those
economies … economists have only infrequently looked directly at the local
causes and consequences of entrepreneurship” (Glaeser, Rosenthal, and
Strange 2009).

Agglomeration, clusters, and uncertainty
Although there has been little direct formal study of entrepreneurship by economists, such areas as the research on agglomeration economies is relative to the
interrelationship between entrepreneurship and workforce development, particularly in an urban setting (Rosenthal and Strange 2005). Work on agglomeration has “sometimes involved direct estimates of productivity … and estimating
correlates of productivity including wages and growth” (Henderson 2003;
Glasser and Mare 2001; Henderson, Kuncoro, and Turner 1995). Related productivity correlates, including new establishment employment and business

“births,” has confirmed the importance of a metropolitan environment
(Rosenthal and Strange 2003) and shows that agglomeration effects attenuate
geographically (Rosenthal and Strange 2003).
Porter (1998, 78), in his work “Clusters and the New Economics of
Competition,” builds on the concept of agglomeration with this notion of “clusters which are defined as geographic concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field.” Clusters include many types of
entities and embrace competitors, support industries, government, and education. In a global, knowledge-based economy, Porter finds that: “The enduring
competitive advantage in a global economy lies increasingly in local things –
knowledge, relationships, and motivations that distant rivals cannot reach”
(Porter 1998, 89). Porter argues that geographic attenuation is mitigated by
more sophisticated and immediate communication and that productivity gain
is an essential element in any successful cluster.
The birth, evolution, and decline of clusters is often based on historical
factors or happenstance, but Porter’s focus is more definitional, utilizing existing clusters as conceptual models rather than proposing new models that unite
workforce development and entrepreneurship into a model for future cluster
formation and development. He raises a clarion call for “new public-private
responsibilities,” citing how clusters reveal the “…mutual dependence and
collective responsibility of all” (Porter 1998, 89–90).

Education as a catalyst
Agglomeration and cluster theories acknowledge the importance of education as
a critical element in entrepreneurial development. During a 15-year period,
Sweden undertook a spatial decentralization of its system of higher education.
Findings of this 15-year experiment revealed significant effects of this policy on
the average productivity of workers, suggesting that the decentralization of
regional development is economically important. Business “births” and “…significant but extremely localized externalities in productivity” were supported by
the decentralization of the Swedish university system (Anderson, Quigley, and
Wilhelmson 2004, 371–72).
With 24 institutions serving 500,000 learners across the five-boroughs of
New York City, The City University of New York (CUNY) might be described as
spatially decentralized as in the above-cited “Swedish Experiment”. It is clear
“…that some force is leading entrepreneurs (in New York City) to agglomerate…”
(Rosenthal and Strange 2005, 29). Urbanization has also been identified as a

factor in business “births and birth employment” and that for all industry
groups, localization is positively associated with entrepreneurship (Rosenthal
and Strange 2005). The role of education, generally, and specifically entrepreneurship education needs to be examined through the lens of community,
localization, and urbanization. In New York City, both educational agglomeration and entrepreneurship agglomeration reside in the same urban ecosystem
with possible, mutually reinforcing interactions. Decentralization of public
higher education has existed in New York City for far longer than the term of
the “Swedish” experiment. Yet, this relationship has largely gone unexamined
and is an opportunity for researchers interested in exploring the relationship
between decentralization of higher education and entrepreneurial start-ups.
Yet in a workshop: “Global Entrepreneurship and Workforce Development”
Senior University (CUNY) Dean for Academic Affairs, John Mogulescu stated: “…
why is there this perception out there that things are troubling, and down the
road a bit we may have some real problems? You can’t read the newspaper any
day without some aspect of us being in this competitive fight, that somehow
we’re falling a bit short…” (AAARI 2005, 8). It would appear that although
educational and entrepreneurial agglomeration exist in the same ecosystem
that they are not, yet, in sync.
Both workforce development and entrepreneurship cite the critical need for
education; yet, there are few studies relating, specifically, to entrepreneurship
education and how it might lead the way in defining how education could be the
catalyst that unites these two priorities. This is particularly important, as our
communities are challenged with educating entrepreneurs to fast-track the
innovation economy to provide the new firm generation and job growth to
secure our economic future. A focus on education would provide a better
formula for economic growth that connects “smart risk takers” (entrepreneurs)
with the workforce community (Wadhwa 2010).

Toward a new model
“Build a magnificent technology park next to a research university; provide
incentives for chosen businesses to locate there; add some venture capital.
That is the common recipe for harnessing higher education and industry to
spur economic growth as described (by)…” the cluster theory developed by
Michael Porter (Wadhwa 2010). Hundreds of regions all over the world have
spent billions of dollars on such efforts; practically all have failed. All of
these are well-intentioned efforts to build Silicon Valley-style technology

hubs, but they are based on the same flawed assumption: that government
planners can pick industries they want to develop, and, by erecting buildings
and providing money to entrepreneurs and university researchers, make
innovation happen. It simply does not work that way. It takes people who
are knowledgeable, motivated, and willing to take risks. Those people have to
be connected to one another and to universities by information sharing social
networks.
(We should) teach Entrepreneurship not just to university students, but also to experienced workers in the workforce. They have ideas for technologies that can be built, and
when they get tired of working for others and want to build wealth, they develop the
motivation to start companies. Most often they simply don’t know how to do this … this
(and other measures) will boost entrepreneurship and increase economic growth (and
employment), but it won’t lead to the creation of the disruptive technologies that
emerge from our universities. To do this, we need to clear the pathways for university
research commercialization and connect researchers with entrepreneurs (and workforce
development).
(Wadhwa 2010)

Thus, it is suggested that a melding of Porter’s prescription and the education of
all workers in the skills of entrepreneurship is what is needed to ensure a
competitive workforce.
All of this implies the need for linkages between universities or other
developers of entrepreneurship skills, government agencies, corporations, community-based organizations, and other interested parties that create a system, or
ecosystem, of support for entrepreneurship-focused workforce development. It
has been argued that such ecosystems have the power to economically transform the communities in which they exist by helping to maximize synergies
between and among their participants (Lichtenstein and Lyons 2001, 2010;
Malecki 2011; Mayer 2012).

Opportunities for further research
The ecosystem described in this commentary has explored “what we know”:
– In times of uncertainty, entrepreneurial clusters tend to agglomerate, especially in urban centers.
– In times of uncertainty and higher unemployment, entrepreneurial activity
increases.
– Spatial decentralization of higher education seems to have a positive impact
on increased entrepreneurial “births”.

It is the relationships and interrelationships between and among these
factors that requires further research. As we continue in this prolonged period
of uncertainty, a better understanding of how education “scaffolds” innovation
and growth is critical to foster innovation, economic growth, and development.
The model in Figure 1 suggests an opportunity for scholars in the fields of
entrepreneurship, economics, higher education, community development, economic development, and among others, to more fully explore the interface
between workforce development and entrepreneurship. Such investigation
might include studies of the necessary linkages for creating impactful entrepreneurship-focused workforce development, the development of models for delivering entrepreneurship education to a broader audience, the creation of metrics
for measuring the impact of efforts to foster entrepreneurship as workforce
development policy, and much more. Like successful entrepreneurs, we scholars
need to recognize the opportunity that exists in the changes affecting the workforce and exploit it for the benefit of society.
