<-----Page 1----->lntellectual Human Capital and the Birth 

of U.S. Biotechnology Enterprises 


The number of American firms actively using
biotechnology grew rapidly from nonexistent to
over 700 in less than two decades, transforming
the nature of the pharmaceutical industry and
significantly impacting food processing, brewing, and agriculture, as well as other industries.
Here we demonstrate empirically that the commercialization of t h s technology is essentially
intertwined with the development of the underlying science in a way which illustrates the significance in practice of the localized spillovers
concept in the agglomeration literature and of
the tacit knowledge concept in the information
literature. Indeed we present here strong evidence that the timing and location of initial usage

by both new dedicated biotechnology firms
( "entrants ") and new biotech subunits of
existing firms ( "incumbents ") are primarily
explained by the presence at a particular time
and place of scientists who are actively contributing to the basic science as represented by
publications reporting genetic-sequence discoveries in academic journals.
By quantifying separable effects of individual scientists, major universities, and federal
research support we provide specific structure
to the role of universities and their faculties in
encouraging local economic development
through what are conventionally described in
the literature as geographically localized
knowledge spillovers.' Such localized knowledge spillovers may play fundamental roles in
both economic agglomeration and endogenous
growth (Paul M. Romer, 1986,1990; Gene M.
Grossman and Elhanan Helpman, 1991 ) .
However, our evidence, like the other literature cited here, specifically indicates localized
effects without demonstrating that they can be
characterized as spillovers (or externalities),
Section I lays out our basic hypothesis. The
data are described in Section 11. Empirical results are reported and discussed in Section 111.
A summary and conclusions section (Section
IV) and Data Appendix complete the article.

' Zvi Griliches ( 1992) has surveyed the importance of
R&D spillovers as a major source of endogenous growth
in recent "new growth theory" models and the difficult
empirical search for their existence. Despite these difficulties, there have been a number of articles reporting evidence of geographic localization of knowledge spillovers,
including Adam 5. Jaffe ( 1989), Jaffe et al. ( 1993), and
Edwin Mansfield ( 1995).

users at a zero marginal cost (Richard R. Nelson
and Romer, 1996). A complementary literature
recognizes that some infomation requires an investment of considerable time and effort to master. The human capital developed by this
investment is seen as earning a normal return on
the cost of the investment, both direct costs and
foregone earnings. We believe that some innovations, particularly a breakthrough ''invention
of a method of inventing" (Griliches, 1957),
may be better characterized as creating (rivalrous ) human capital -intellectual human
capital-characterized by namral excludability
as opposed to a set of instructions for combining
inputs and outputs which can be protected only
by intellectud property rights. This natural excludability arises from the complexity or tacitness of the information required to practice the
innovation ( see Nelson 11959 1, Kenneth J.
Arrow [1962], Nelson and Sidney G. Winter
[1982], and Nathan Rosenberg [1982]).
Based on both extensive interviews and empirical work summarized in Zucker and Darby
(1996), we believe that, at least for the first
10 or 15 years, the innovations which underlie
biotechnology are properly analyzed in terms
of naturally excludable knowledge held by a
small initial group of discoverers, their coworkers, and others who learned the h o w l edge from working at the bench-science level
with those possessing the requisite know-how.
Ultimately the knowledge spread sufficiently
widely to become part of routine science
which could be learned at any major research
university. After the initial 1973 discovery by
Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer of the basic
technique for recombinant DNA-the foundation of commercial biotechnology as well as
of a burst of scientific innovation-the financial returns available to talented recombinantDNA scientists first rose dramatically as the
commercial implications became widely appreciated and then more gradually declined as
more and more scientists learned the techniques, until knowledge of the new techniques
per se earned only the normal return for the
time required for a graduate student to master
them. Further, mere knowledge of the techniques of recombinant DNA was not enough
to earn these extraordinary returns; the knowledge was far more productive when embodied
in a scientist with the genius and vision to con-

291

tinuouslv innovate and define the research
frontier and apply the new research techniques
in the most promising areas.
We hypothesize that entry of fims into biotechnology in a given year thus will be determined by the geographic distribution of stars
and perhaps others then actively practicing the
new science as well as by the geographic distribution of economic activity. Stars are properly viewed as locationally (semi-) fixed since
few star scientists who knew how to do recombinant DNA were willing to abandon their university appointments and laboratory teams to
pursue commercial applications of biotechnology. The primary pattern in the development
of the industry involved one or more scientistentrepreneurs who remained on the faculty
while establishing a business on the sidebusinesses which, where successful, resulted
in millions or even billions of dollass for the
professors who acquired early ownership
stakes. Thus, we see the university as bringing
about local industrial benefits by permitting its
professors to pursue private comercial interests while their faculty appointments tie them
to the area. In preliminary work not reported
here, we tried to develop measures of local
economic activity for industries, like pharmaceuticals, specifically impacted by the new
technology, but these attempts never added
significantly to the measures of general activity used in the empirical work below The local availability of venture capital is widely
believed to play a significant role in the birth
of new biotech entrants (Martin Kenney,
1986; Joshua Lerner, 1994, 1995); so we also
include that variable in our regressions.
11. The Data

Data has been collected in panel for111 for 14
years (1976-1989) and 183 regions ( f ~ n c tional economic areas as defined by the
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
Economic Analysis [ B E A ] , 1932b). Frequently, the data are aggregates of data at the
zip code or county level.2 Lagged variables
The I3EA's functional economic areas divide all the
counties in the United States into regions including one or
more cities, their suburbs, and the rural countiles most
closely tied to the central clty.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

include data for 1975 in the unlagged form.
See the Data Appendix for more details.
A. Firms
Our data set on firms was derived from a
base purchased from the North Carolina Biotechnology Center (NCBC) ( 1992) which
was cleaned and supplemented with information in Bioscan ( 1989- 1993) and its precursor
(Cetus Corp., 1988). We identified 751 distinct U.S. firms for which we could determine
a zip code and a date of initial use of biotechnology. Of these 751 firms, 51 1 were entrants,
150 incumbents, and 90 (including 18 joint
ventures) could not be definitively classified.
By 1990, 52 of the 751 firms had died or
merged into other firms.
We then calculated the number of births in
each region by year of initial use of biotechnology for all 751 firms as well as for their
identified subcomponents of entrants and incumbents. We also have the stocks of surviving firms, entrants, and incumbents by region
and year.
B. Scientists
Early in our ongoing project studying the
scientific development and diffusion of biotechnology, we identified a set of 327 star scientists hased on their outstanding productivity
through early 1990. The primary criterion for
selections was the discovery of more than 40
genetic sequences as reported in GenBank
(1990) through April 1990.%owever, 22 scientists were included based on writing 20 or
more articles, each reporting one or more
In the 1990's,
genetic-sequence di~coveries.~

'See Zucker et al. ( 1993). As will be obvious, much
of the time between 1990 and the initial submission of this
paper was spent in developing reasonable measures of intellectual human capital and in collecting and coding data
necessary to locate the authors of the discoveries reported
in the articles in question and to trace the diffusion
process.
Scientists advised that some sequence discoveries are
more difficult than others and thus merit an article reporting only one sequence. Therefore we included scientists
with 20 or more discovery articles to avoid excluding scientists who specialized in more difficult problems.

MARCH 1998

sequence discovery has become routinized and
is no longer such a useful measure of research
success. These 327 stars were only threequarters of one percent of the authors in
GenBank ( 1990) but accounted for 17.3 percent of the published articles, almost 22 times
as many articles as the average scientist.
We collected by hand the 4,061 articles authored by stars and listed in GenBank and recorded the institutional affiliation of the stars
and their coauthors on each of these articles.
These coauthors are called "collaborators " if
they are not themselves a star. Some data on
the stars and collahorators who ever published
in the United States is given on the left side of
Table 1, where the scientists are identified by
the organization(s) with which they were affiliated on their first-such publication. The
higher citation rate for firm-affiliated scientists
is explored at length in Zucker and Darby
(1996).
Figure 1 illustrates the time pattern of
growth in the numbers of stars and collaborators who have ever published and the total
number of firms using biotechnology in the
United States. There was a handful of stars
who published articles reporting geneticsequence discoveries before the 1973 breakthrough, but even after 1973 their number
increased gradually until taking off in 1980.
The numbers of collaborators and firms lagged
behind the growth in stars by some years.
To identify those scientists clearly working
at the edge of the science in a given year, we
term a star or collaborator as "active " if he
or she has published three or more sequencediscovery articles in the three-year moving
window ending with that year. As seen in the
right side of Table 1, this stringent second
screen provides an even more elite definition
of star scientists as well as identifying some
very significant collaborators. We count for
each year the number of active stars and active
collaborators who are affiliated with an organization in each region.
The locations of active stars and firms are
both concentrated and highly correlated geographically, particularly early in the period.
Figure 2 illustrates this pattern for the whole
period by accumulating the number of stars
who have ever been active in each region up
to 1990 and plotting them together with the

C . Other Measures of Intellectual 

Human Capital 


Active stars and collaborators may be incomplete measures of location of the scientific
base because there are techniques other than
recombinant DNA which have played an important role in commercial biotechnology.
Some skeptical readers might also think that
some simpler measures of regions' relevant
academic resources would contain all the information which we have laboriously collected. We found two measures of regional
scientific base which entered separately in regressions reported below, but none which
were capable of eliminating the effects of the
star scientists.

One measure is a count of the number of
"top-quality universities " in a region where
top quality is defined by having one or more
"biotech-relevant" (biochemistry, cellular1
molecular biology, and microbiology ) departments with scholarly quality reputational ratings of 4.0 or higher in the 1982 National
Research Council survey (Lyle V. Jones et al.,
1982). There are 20 such universities in the
United state^.^ Our second measure, "federal

Technology, Rockefeller University, Stanford University, University of California-Berkeley, University of

Pennsylvania, University of Washington (Seattle), University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Yale University.

111. Empirical Results

We test our hypothesis using both the full
panel data and by regressing the geographical
distribution of the data in 1990 on values
of the independent variables circa 1980. The
former more fully exploit the available information while the latter avoid problems of possible simultaneity which might arise after
1980 when commercial biotechnology became a significant economic factor in some
regions. All the regressions reported here, as
well as an extensive sensitivity analysis noted
below, were estimated in the poisson forni appropriate for count variables with numerous
zeroes using LIMDEP (William W. Greene,
1992 pp. 539 - 4 9 ) , with the Wooldridge
regression-based correction for the variance-

covariance matrix estimates."he
poisson
regressions estimate the logarithm of the expected number of firm births; so the signs and
significance of coefficients have the usual interpretation. Although 01,s regressions are inappropriate for our count dependent variables
with most observations at zero and the rest tailing off through small positive integers, we

As discussed in Jerry Hausnian et al. ( 1984), the poisson process is the most appropriate statistical rnodel for
count data such as ours. In practice, overdispersion (possibly due to unobserved heterogeneity) frequently occurs.
Given the problems with resort to the negative binomial
(A. Colin Cameron and Pravin K. Trivedi, 1990), Jeffrey
M. Wooldridge ( 1991 ) developed a ilexible and consistent
method for correcting the poisson variance-covariance
matrix estimates regardless of the ur~derlyingrelationship
between the mean and variance. We are indebted to
Wooldridge and Greene for advice in implementing the
procedure in LIMDEP.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

reported broadly consistent results using that
technique in an earlier version of the paper
(Zucker et al., 1994).
In our sensitivity analysis, we ran the same
poisson regressions for entrants and incumbents defined both exclusive and inclusive of
the arguable case of joint ventures. The results
were generally very similar to the subcomponent regressions in Table 4. In other unreported poisson regressions, we found that
eliminating those regions with no firms and no
stars from the sample did not result in gualitatively different results.

A. The Long-Run Model
Because of concerns about possible sirnultaneity biases once the industry became a
significant economic force, we begin our empirical discussion with models which relate the
number of firms in each region at the beginning of 1990 to the distribution of intellectual
human capital and other variables as of about
1980. These results provide something of an
acid test of our approach.
In Table 2, we present cross-section poisssn
regressions across the 183 regions explaining
the number of firms in each at the beginning
of 1990 when our data set ends.' Cdumn (a)
restrains the analysis to only the numbers of
stars and collaborators ever active in each region at any time up through 1980, while columns (b) and ( c ) add first their squares and
then our other intellectual human capital variables. Columri ( d ) considers alternatively
other economic variables which might explain
entry, and column ( e ) combines the variables
in ( c ) and ( d ) . Column (f ) adds to this model
the number of biotech firms existing in 1980.
Column (a) in Table 2 indicates that thc
number of stars and collaborators active
through 1980 is a powerful predictor of the

'

In an earlier version of this paper we included an alternative form of Table 2 (available from the authors upon
request) in order to forestall interpretations that the results
in Table 2 may reflect reverse causality. This alternative
table reported regressions which explain the number of
firms alive at the beginning of 1990 that were born after
1980. Nearly identical results were obtained, reflecting the
fact that bulk of new biotechnology enterprises were
founded after 1980.

geographic distribution of biotech enterprises
in 1990, since the log-likelihood increases to
-871.9 com~aredto -1401.7 for a constant
alone. It is the star scien~iststhat contribute
positively, with collaborators having a much
smaller negative coefficient in this regression
and most f the other long-run models discussed below. We had expected that the coefficient on collaborators would be much
smaller than that on stars, but ~ositive.We do
obtain a positive coefficient on activc collaborators when the squared terns are added in
column (b) , but that turns negative again upon
addition of other variables in the remaining
columns of Table 2.'" (In the annual regressions discussed below, we generally estimate
positive effects of active collaborators, but
they are often statistically insignificant.)
We can offer two explanations for the generally negative sign oi the number of active
collaborators in the long-run regressions: (i)
This coefficient reflects two partially offsetting
influences: collaborators have a ~ositivedirect
effect on the entry of films but reduce the effect of stars who are devoting more of their
time to training students and relatively less to
starting their own finns. Training collaborators
is surely a useful and rewarded activity-particularly for the academic stars-but k t may
take more of the stars9 energy than it is worth
if firm birth were the only criteria." (ii) The
sign and magnitude of the coefficient on collaborators may simply reflect significant multicollinearity among the intellectual human
capital variables in the very early years. This
is especially likely since when we examine thc

"I In column ( b ) of Table 2 (and Table 3 ) , the negative
coefficient on the squared term indicates that as the number of stars or collaborators increases, their marginal contribution diminishes eventually passing through zero. For
collaborators, in columns ( c ) - ( f ) of these tables the sign
pattern reverses so that the partial derivative of the log
probability of birth with respect to collaborators starts out
negative, and increases as their number increases, eventually becoming positive.
" In support of this explanation, we note that in our
sensitivity analysis we tried regressions which substituted
interaction terms multiplying the numbers of active stars
and collaborators for the squared terms. In those regressions, we obtain significant positive coefficients on the
numbers of stars and col!abnrators and a significant negative coefficient on their interaction.

full cross-sectionltime-series results just below we obtain (we think more reliable) zero
or positive coefficients on collaborators, so the
puzzle largely disappears.
The full "fundamentals" model (excepting
the decade-lagged dependent variable) is presented in column ( e ) of Table 2, where all the
coefficients are significant except that for total
employment. Leaving aside the question of the
negative collaborator coefficient, we note the
strong, positive, separate effects of stars, topquality universities, and federal research

grants tit universities on birth of firms in a
given geographic region. The intellectual human capital variables alone increase the loglikelihood ratio from -1401.7 to -543.2 [see
column (c)], with the final three variables
bringing this quantity up to --416.0. As to the
last three variables, the quality of the labor
force, measured by average wages per job,
seems much more relevant than its size. Surprisingly, to some observers, the number of
venture capital firms in a region enters, but
with a significantly negative sign. We interpret

<-----Page 9----->298

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

the negative sign as evidence that venture capitalists did play an active role in the formation
of entrant firms, but they apparently resulted
in fewer, larger firms being born in the areas
in which they were more active."
This sign of the coefficient of the number of
venture capital firms in a region is robust in
sensitivity experiments with other forms (not
reported here) except for regressions which
exclude the intellectual human capital variables such as in column ( d ) . That regression
looks good in terms of significance and expected sign pattern although it has a much
lower explanatory power than the intellectual
human capital variables alone [column ( c ) ] .
Just below, we report very similar results in a
cross-sectionltime-series context. Thus, it is
certainly easy to see why the evidence for an
important positive impact of venture capital
firms on the birth of biotech firms may have
appeared stronger in previous work than seems
warranted based on fuller models: Since venture capital firms have developed around a
number of great universities, their presence
proxies for intellectual human capital in the
absence of more direct measures; if they are
the only variable indicating presence of great
universities and their faculties, they enter positively even if their packaging activities result
in a negative direct effect on births.
The decade-lagged dependent variable is
added to the full fundamentals model in column ( f ) of Table 2. Doing so primarily has
the effect of weakening the significance of the
top-quality universities variable (but, see the
annual model below) due to significant multicollinearity between the variables.'' One interpretation of this positive coefficient on the
lagged dependent variable is that agglomera-

''

This hypothesis was derived from anecdotal evidence, but note that the top nine of Emst & Young's list
of top-ten companies by 1993 market valuation (G. Steven
Burrill and Kenneth B. Lee, Jr., 1334 p. 54) were located
and founded in regions richly endowed with venture capital firms: Boston (3), San Francisco ( 3 ) , Los Angeles
( 1 ) , San Diego ( 1 ) , and Seattle ( 1) .
j 3 In the alternative version of Table 2 (see footnote 9
above), the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable
was nearly as large as in Table 2, so the significant positive
coefficient does not arise from firms born 1976- 1980 appearing in both the current and lagged dependent
variables.

MARCH I998

tion effects strengthen the impact of fundamentals on regional development. However,
the statistical properties of poisson regressions
with lagged dependent variables are somewhat
so such regressions and their estimated standard errors should be viewed
cautiously.
In conclusion. the intellectual human c a ~ i t a l
variables play a stron-tg role in determining
where the U.S. biotech industry developed
during the B 980's. We have been able to iden-tify particular star scientists who appear to
play a crucial role in the process of spillover
and geographic agglomeration over and above
that which-would be ~redictedbased on university reputation and scientists supported by
federal grants alone. The strong positive role
of venture capital variable reported previously
is not supported for firm births. Indeed, the
data tell us that there were fewer firms
founded, other things equal, where there more
venture capital firms. It is left to future re.search to explore whether firms which are associated with particular star scientists or were
midwifed by venture capitalists are more successful than other fi~ms.'"

B. The Annual Model
We next report analogous poisson regressions exploiting the panel nature of our data
set with observations for the 183 regions for

as the knowledge diffuses we expect that more
and more stars will result in less and less payoff to any one of them if he or she were to start
a firm, and indeed stars are less likely to result

in birth of firms after 1985 than before. This
is illustrated in column (c) of Table 3 where
we add four interaction ternls in which these
counts and their squares have been multiplied

<-----Page 11----->300

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

by a dummy DUMMY1986-89 equal to 1
during 1986- 1989 and 0 otherwise, as well as
the other intellectual human capital terms.
During 1986-1989 the positive effect of stars
is sharply reduced while that of collaborators
more than triples.15 Nonetheless, we should
view this inference cautiously since the significance values of the interaction terms for
stars and collaborators with DlJMMY 198689 fall between 0.10 and 0.05, except for stars
in the full fundamentals model in column ( e )
where the stars interaction term is significant
at the 0.01 level.
Thus, we see that (at least during the first
decade of this industry) localities with outstanding scientists having the tacit knowledge
to practice recombinant DNA were much more
likely to see new firms founded and preexisting fims begin to apply biotechnology. There
is some evidence that as knowledge about
gene splicing diffused and the tacit knowledge
lost its scarcity and extraordinary value, the
training function of universities became more
important relative to the attraction of great scientists to an area. It is interesting that the quadratic term for stars is negative, suggesting
diminishing returns (or possibly just proportionately fewer, larger firms) rather than the
increasing returns suggested by standard
views of knowledge spillovers which posit uninternalized, positive external effects from
university scientists.'' In the same regression
in column ( c ) , we see that, beyond the identified stars and collaborators, university quality and federal support are also significant
measurer of intellectual human capital relevant to firm founding.

" T o compute the effects of stars in the 1986-1989
period, we need to add the coefficients of the number of
active stars and the coefficient of the same variable interacted with DIJMMY1986-89 and then do the same for
the two terms involving the squared values of these variables. An analogous approach yields the effect of collaborators during 1986- 1989. We examined also interactions
with dummy variables for 1976-1980 and with a time
trend. Since the coefficients were very small and statistically insignificant for interaction terms involving 19761980 dummies, we believe the reported form inore
accurately reflects the time or diffusion dependence than
a negative trend throughout the period.
''We are indebted to Jeff Armstrong for this point.

Column (d) of Table 3 leads to the same
conclusions with panel data as found for the
same column in Table 2: 'The economic variables enter significantly with the expected sign
if the intellectual human capital variables are
omitted from the regression: However, unlike
the previous long-run case, we can now enter
the earnings-price ratio.17 Here this variable
enters with the correct sign, but does not even
reach the 0.10 level of significance.
Column (e) of Table 3 presents the annual
full fundamentals model incorporating the intellectual human capital and other variables.
The results for the intellectual human capital
measures are robust while the sign of the venture capital variable turns significantly negative as in the long-run model and the
employment variable becomes insignificant
(and negative)
Column ( f ) of Ta.ble 3, analogously to Table 2, adds ;a lagged dependent variable to the
full fundamentals model. We also included the
one-year lagged regional and national counts
of firms using biotechnology as dynamic influences reflecting local agglomeration effects
and market competition effects, respectively,
None of the three dynamic variables enter significantly although their signs are consistent
with some geographic agglomeration.

THE AMERICAN ECONOlMlC REVIEW

cantly positive effect on the birth of new firms
but an insignificant effect on the birth of subunits of existing firms which would not normally be financed by venture capital firms. The
full fundamentals model is reported in columns ( c ) and ( d ) for births of entrants and
incumbents, respectively, which is to be compared to column ( e ) for all firm births in Table
3. Again, in the presence of intellectual human
capital the simple economic story does not
hold up: the coefficients of venture capital
firms and total employment turn negative, significantly so in the former case. Similar results
are obtained in the dynamic versions of the full
model reported in c o l u m s ( e ) and ( f ) of Table 4. The robustness of the negative venture
capital coefficient remains a puzzle for future
work, particularly in view of Yolanda K.
Henderson9s ( 1989 ) evidence that, despite
some significant localization, most investments by venture capitalists cross regional
boundaries.
IV. Summary and Conclusions

The American biotechnology industry
which was essentially nonexistent in 1975
grew to 700 active firms over the next 15
years. In this paper, we show the tight connection between the intellectual human capital
created by frontier research and the founding
of firms in the industry. At least for this hightech industry, the growth and location of intellectual human capital was the principal
determinant of the growth and location of the
industry itself. This industry is a testament to
the value of basic scientific research. The number of local venture capital firms, which appears to be a positive determinant when
intellectual human capital variables are excluded from the regressions, is found to depress the rate of firm birth in an area, perhaps
due to the role of these venture capital firms
in packaging a number of scientists into one
larger firm which is likely to go public sooner.
We conclude that the growth and diffusion
of intellectual human capital was the main determinant of where and when the American
biotechnology industry developed. Intellectual
human capital tended to flourish around great
universities, but the existence of outstanding
scientists measured in terms of research prs-

MARCH 1998

ductivity played a key role over, above, and
separate from the presence of those universities and government research funding to them.
We believe that our results provide new insight into the role of research universities and
their top scientists as central to the formation
of new high-tech industries spawned by scientific breakthroughs. By being able to quantitatively identify individuals with the ability
both to invent and to commercia!ize these
breakthroughs, we have developed new specificity for the idea of spillovers and in paiticular
raised the issue of whether spillovers are best
viewed as resulting from the nonappropriability of scientific knowledge or from the maximizing behavior of scientists who have the
ability to appropriate the commercial fruits sf
their academic discoveries.

The data used here are generally in panel
form for 14 years ( 1976.- 1989) and 183
regions (functional economic areas as defined
by the BEA). Frequently, the data are aggregates of data at the zip code or county level.
Lagged variables include data for 1975 in the
unlagged form. These data sets, part of our ongoing project on "Intellectual Capital, Technology Transfer, and the Organization of
Leading-Edge Industries: Biotechnology,"
will be archived upon completion of the project in the Data Archives at the UCLA Institute
for Social Science Research. A full description
of the data is available from the authors upon
request.
Biotechnology Firms
The starting point for our firm data set cavered the industry as of April 1990 and was
purchased from NCBC ( 1991) , a private firm
which tracks the industry. This data set identified 1075 firms, some of which were duplicates or foreign and others of which had died
or merged. Further, there were a significant
number of firms missing which had exited
prior to April 1990. For these reasons, an intensive effort was made to supplement the
NCBC data with information from Bioscan
(1989-1993) and an industry data set provided by a firm in the fndustry which was also

<-----Page 14----->VOL. 88 NO. 1

ZUCKER ET AL.: HUMAN CAPITAL AND BZOTECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISES

the ancestor of the Bioscan data set (Cetus
Corp., 1988).
We generally counted entry of firms by adding up for each year and region the number of
entrants founded and incumbents first using
biotechnology. A few special cases should be
noted: Where a firm enters the data set due to
the merger of a entrant and another film, we
count it for the purposes of this paper as a continuation of the original entrant and not a new
birth (the older entrant if two are involved).
If firms already in the data set merge and one
continues with the other(s) absorbed, the enterprise is counted as the continuing enterprise
and not a new birth.
Scientists

Star scientists and their collaborators were
identified as described in the text. Individual
scientists are linked to locations through the
institutional affiliations reported in their
publications in the article data set. The discovery of genetic sequences is recognized by
GenBank's assignment to an article of a "primary accession number" to identify each. The
22 additional stars added to the 3 15 with more
than 40 primary accession numbers thus had
20 or more articles with at least one primary
accession number and 20-40 primary accession numbers total.
Articles

Our article data set consists of all 4,061 articles in major journals listed in GenBank as
reporting genetic-sequence discoveries for
which one or more of our 327 stars were listed
as authors. ( A small number of unpublished
papers and articles appearing in proceedings
volumes and obscure journals were excluded
to permit the hand coding detailed below.) All
of these articles were assigned unique article
ID numbers and collected bv hand. For each
article, scientist ID numbers are used to idenand the institut i f ~the
tional affiliation and location for each author
on each article. This hand coding was necessary because, under the authorship traditions
the head of the laboratory who
for these
is often the most prestigious author frequently
appears last. Our stars, for example, were first

303

authors on 18.3 percent of the articles and last
authors on 69.1 percent of the 4,031 articles
remaining after excluding the 30 sole-authored
articles." Unfortunately, only first- and/or
corresponding-author affiliations are available
in machine-readable source^.'^
The resulting authorship data file contains
19,346 observations, approximately 4.8 authors for each of the 4,061 published articles.
Each authorship observation gives the article
ID number, the order of authorship, the scientist ID number of one of our stars and collaborators, and an institutional ID number
for the author's affiliation which links him
or her to a particular institution with a known
zip code as of the publication date of the
article.
Citations

We have collected data for 1982, 1987, and
1992 on the total number of citations to each
of our 4,061 published articles listed in the Institute for Scientific Information's Science Citation Index (1982, 1987, 1992). These
citation counts are linked to the article and authorship data set by the article ID number. The
citations were collected for articles if and only
if they appeared in the article data set; so scientists are credited with citations only insofar
as they are to the 4,061 articles reporting
genetic-sequence discoveries and published in
major journals.
Universities

Our university data set consists of all U.S.
institutions listed as granting the Ph.T). degree
in any field in the Higher Education General

This positional tradition holds across national baundaries: As a percentage of articles coauthored by their fellow nationals. American stars are 16.4 Dercernt of first
authors and 71.2 percent of last autllors, compared to 21.2
percent and 63.1 percent, respectively, for Japanese, and
19.7 percent and 69.2 percent for other nationalities.

No additional information has been collected
on these institutions.
Venture Capital Firms
We created a venture capital firm data set
by extracting from the Pratt ( 1982) directory
the name, type, location, year of founding, and
interest in funding biotech firnis. This information was extracted for all venture capital
which were legally permitted to finance startups. This latter requirement eliminated a number of firms which are chartered under
government programs targeted at small and
minority businesses. This approach accounts
includes founding date of firms appearing in
the 1982 Pratt directory, excluding those firms
that may have either entered thereafter or existed in earlier years but exited before the directory was compiled.
Other Economic Variables
Total employment and average earnings
per job by region and year are as reported by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis based on
county Level data in U.S. Department of
Commerce ( 199%) : Total employment is
from Table K, line 010 (in millions of persons). Average earnings is from Table 61,
