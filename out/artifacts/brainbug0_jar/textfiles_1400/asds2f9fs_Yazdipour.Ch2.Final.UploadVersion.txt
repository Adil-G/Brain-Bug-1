Abstract Three central decisions in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial finance – entry/seed
funding, financing/investment, and growth/exit – are discussed and case is made for applying the
behavioral finance theories and concepts to better understand the involved decision processes
and consequently, to help improve the decision making process for both entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists. The behavioral finance approach is important because the traditional finance
has remained silent on the first issue, and the Agency Theory (financial contracting), which is
effectively the only theory that is applicable to issues in entrepreneurial finance, has produced
mixed empirical results2. Attempts are also made in this chapter to introduce some new concepts
– “Perception Asymmetry”, “Resident Risk”, and a preliminary behavioral risk framework – that
as complements to the existing constructs could be used in discussions on decision making under
risk and uncertainty. Although the focus is on individual decision making under highly uncertain

be extended to decision making in other uncertain environments.

2.1 Introduction
In general, there are three types of problems that require decision making on part of the
entrepreneurs and investors. They are:
1.
2.
3.

Entry/Seed Funding Decisions,
Financing/Investment Decisions, and
Growth/Exit Decisions.

Given our approach in this chapter is on the application of theory, I have stated the above
problems in such a way that they involve two decision makers that are needed to conclude a
transaction. Throughout this writing, such two decision makers are entrepreneurs and investors,
also known as venture capitalists or VCs.
Additionally, regardless of one’s association with either of the two finance paradigms, traditional
finance or behavioral finance, uncertainty and return remain to be the determining factors in all
the three decision problems listed in above3.
Moreover, although the traditional finance and economic theories have had some successes
in providing some solutions to the last two problems, but they have had little to say on how
entrepreneurs decide to start a new venture and how investors select such ventures for investment
purposes4. By design, the dominant traditional theory, the Agency Theory, can not make any
predictions regarding firm entry or exit issues. Furthermore, such paucity of research on the
subject should not be surprising at all because in the standard finance and economic theory,
problems have to be definable in mathematical terms to be considered for any type of analysis
and application. The rational construct assumes that economic agents- investors, managers of all
kind, and entrepreneurs- are “capable of understanding vastly complex puzzles and conduct
3

In this chapter, and especially where both traditional and behavioral finance paradigms are discussed, we
intentionally use the terms risk and uncertainty interchangeably. As will be seen soon, some leading scholars have
shifted the whole notion and source of risk and uncertainty away from evidence-based risk, as defined by
statistical tools, to perception-based uncertainty. Chapter 3, written by Professor Olsen, mainly deals with the
latter notion of risk.
4
Two points should be mentioned in here:
a. I use the word “some” because as will be seen in this writing, traditional finance models such as Agency
Theory continue to have their own shortcomings in explaining and predicting behavior. For details see
Bitler, et, al, 2009 and Kaplan and Kaplan and Stromberg, 200; and
b. On related research we have to mention Camerer and Lovallo’s work (1999) where they use
overconfidence to explain failure.

2

<-----Page 2----->endless instantaneous optimizations”5. Also the standard finance theory has built its whole
foundation after a human brain that in H.A. Simon’s words “… serves, perhaps, as a model of
the mind of God, but certainly not as a model of the mind of man”6. Therefore, to the traditional
financial economists, uncertainty – a truly perceptual and personal phenomenon – does not fall
in such a category and therefore cannot be operationalized in any “meaningful” way7.
On the other hand, over the past 30 years or so psychologists, and more recently
neuroscientists, have helped us to better understand the human decision making processes; and
more specifically, how we as individuals perceive risk and uncertainty and how we take the
required actions at the judgment time8. Scientific breakthroughs in those fields have also given
rise to the new subfield of behavioral finance9. It is through such behavioral lenses that we
believe attempts should be made to address the three central questions listed in above. Our main
focus in this chapter involves the application of behavioral finance and economic theories to the
least explored of such three decisions; i.e., the Entry/Seed Funding decisions. Given we first
need to communicate with each other in this rather unfamiliar territory, attempts are made in this
chapter to introduce some new concepts – which include “Perception Asymmetry”, “Resident
Risk”, and a behavioral risk model – that as complements to the existing concepts and tools
could be used in any discussion on decision making under risk and uncertainty.
Section 2 provides a brief background on the decision problems that entrepreneurs and
their financial backers, venture capitalists or VCs, face in the course of their business. Section 3
discusses some new concepts along with an attempt to provide a preliminary behavioral risk
model; believing that if we better understand the uncertainties that are involved in and around the
problems, we will have a better chance of providing more effective solutions to them. Section 4
summarizes the chapter and provides some suggestions for future research.

<-----Page 3----->As said in above, our main focus in here is on the application of behavioral finance and
economics theories to entry/seed funding decisions- jointly defined as launch decisions. Such
joint decisions involve two separate but related decisions by both an entrepreneur and a VC. The
reason for discussing and analyzing the two decisions together is a practical necessity. That is,
the decision to enter a business by an entrepreneur alone does not mean much; unless, she can
convince a VC to fund her startup. With this in mind, there are two central questions that both
entrepreneurs and VCs face in a launch decision.
a. What are the decision processes for entrepreneurs in a launch decision, and what
are the decision criteria in that regard?
b. What are the decision processes for venture capitalists in investing in a launch,
and what are the decision criteria in that regard?
2.2.2 Markets for Venture Capital
In free enterprise systems, the role of efficient capital markets is to facilitate the flow of funds
between the suppliers and the demanders of capital. Well functioning capital markets also insure
that funds are raised and invested at competitive and reasonable rates. Operational transparency
is among the most important requirements for the smooth working of such markets. Efficient
market mechanisms certainly support innovation, job creation, economic development, and
business growth. Inefficient capital markets will have the opposite effects. In the U.S. and other
free market economies, transparent and public capital markets which serve large corporations
have played such a role with unprecedented success in history.
However, markets for venture capital, broadly defined in this chapter as those markets that serve
the capital needs of small firms ranging from startups to pre-IPO companies, are certainly not
among the well functioning capital markets. This is true even in the U.S., the birthplace of
venture capital. The opaqueness of these markets is the main reason behind their operational
inefficiency. Naturally, such inefficiency translates into increased levels of risk and uncertainty,
and consequently increased costs of doing business for small and entrepreneurial companies
which such markets serve.
2.2.3 Traditional Finance and Economics’ Response to Launch Decisions
To resolve the problems that arise in the opaque venture capital markets that we just described,
traditional finance theory has offered a relatively large body of literature and theories that are
based on the classical Principal-Agent and Information Asymmetry theories. Under one version
of the Information Asymmetry (IA) for example, the opaqueness of the IPO markets is addressed
and a solution like Signaling Theory is provided. Other IA problems addressed range from
4

<-----Page 4----->corporate debt financing to dividend policy and corporate takeovers10. Under Principal-Agent, or
Agency Theory (AT), the presumed conflict of interest between owner-managers and investors is
addressed11 (this is also called “interest asymmetry”) and “optimum” financial contracts are
offered to compensate for the assumed conflicts of interest and other additional risks and
uncertainties 12.
However, even with so much work done in the area of financial contracting, a recent study
(Bitler, et al, 2009) states, “an extensive theoretical literature examines the principal-agent
problem, …. yet, evidence supporting theory’s predictions is mixed and weak.” Besides,
Treating entrepreneurs as agents and venture capitalists as principals, as it is the case in AT, is a
questionable start; because by definition entrepreneurs are the opposite of agents who are good at
taking orders. Entrepreneurs on the other hand are independent individuals, again by definition,
because they want to be their “own bosses”! In fact a great majority of entrepreneurs cannot even
work within a corporate structure just like a regular employee, an agent.
And this now takes us to the main topic of this chapter as discussed in the following section.

3. A Behavioral Approach to Decision Making in Entrepreneurial Finance
The approach that we have taken in this chapter and especially this section is based on the belief
that if we can better understand the types of risks and uncertainties that are involved in and
around the entrepreneurial finance problems listed at the beginning of the chapter, we will have a
better chance of understanding the related decision processes. Moreover, we also believe that
such an understanding alone would bring more transparency for all parties in any given
transaction, like a financial contract, and consequently, improve their decision processes.
However the attempt will not end here as we also try to put together “pieces of the risk puzzle”
and see if a meaningful risk framework can emerge for any future use and analysis. With these
in mind, we now continue with such a plan and as follows.

3.1Perception Asymmetry
We introduce the Perception Asymmetry as a counterpart to standard finance theory’s
Information Asymmetry as described in below. But before defining and further discussing the

it must be the financial contracting branch.

<-----Page 5----->proposed imbalance, it would be helpful if we refresh our memory about the Prospect Theory
and the Affect Heuristic which are discussed in more details the Appendix.
According to Prospect Theory (PT), there are two distinct phases to each decision- an initial
phase called Editing or Framing; and a second phase called Evaluation phase. The editing phase
includes a number of operations that simplify decision problems before they are sent for
evaluation. Options are evaluated via the Value Function so that a final decision can be made
regarding the decision problems under consideration.
According to Affect theory, subjective impressions of "goodness" or "badness" can act as a
heuristic, capable of producing fast perceptual judgments. For example, stocks perceived as
"good" are judged to have low risks and high returns and stocks perceived as "bad" are judged to
have low returns and high risks.
By building upon the Prospect Theory and the Affect heuristic as just mentioned, and using our
example of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists for illustration, we propose that the perceptions
of both entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and consequently their judgments, will be shaped
by the triple effects of:
1. The Prospect Theory’s editing operations which include Coding, Combination,
Segregation, and Cancellation,
2. The Prospect Theory’s value function where “probability weights” are assigned, and
3. The Affect heuristic’s capability of producing perceptual judgments.
In addition to above, the working of the brain would add the fourth effect; but for now we will
limit our coverage to the key psychological phenomena13.
We now define Perception Asymmetry as the situation under which a perception gap exists for at
least one party to a transaction. More specifically, in case of our present discussion, we define
Perception Asymmetry (PA) as the situation under which a perception gap exists between an
entrepreneur and a venture capitalist (VC) regarding the same business opportunity, its gain and
loss potentials, and consequently the opportunity’s perceived value. Furthermore, the only
situation in which such a gap will not exist is when both the entrepreneur and the VC in question
share the same psyche; something that is not physically possible.
We suspect the proposed imbalance would help create a better understanding for both parties
regarding each other’s views on a transaction like a seed funding deal. Such an understanding
13

I am not specifically discussing other heuristics and biases for two main reasons. First, the Prospect Theory and
Affect cover most, if not all, of such heuristics and biases. Second, given this is a preliminary framework, I’d rather
to stay on the central issues to prevent any confusion. For detailed discussion of these biases see the Appendix.

beneficial decision and ultimately conclusion of a deal.

3.2 Resident Risks and Behavioral Risks: Toward a Behavioral Risk Model
Some behavioral finance scholars, especially Slovic and Olsen, have advocated that risk
is not “something out there”. By that, they mean risk is not an evidence-based phenomenon like
standard deviation, beta, or other variations thereof that can be measured and used in financial
decision making14. Put differently, risk does not exist “out there” so that we a) observe it, b)
measure and analyze it, and c) use it as an input in our Expected Utility (EU)-based calculations.
Slovic (1987) attributes business risk to individual survival risk where he says, “Humans have an
additional capability that allows them to alter their environment as well as respond to it. This
capacity both creates and reduces risk”15. He further adds that the “concept risk means different
things to different people”16. Moreover, as we will see in this chapter, affect plays one of the
most important roles in the perception of risk by individuals17. For example if a person has a
positive affect regarding a given venture, she/he may perceive the risk in that venture much less
than the risks perceived by other individuals with a lower level of affect for the same exact
venture under otherwise the same exact circumstances.
Olsen specifically states that, “all risk that is acted upon must be perceived risk because
perception is based upon sensory data. We can only sense the ‘real world’ because we have no
other way of being informed.”18 This effectively means risk is a phenomenon that is created in
our psyche- the “in here” risk versus the “out there risk” phrase that we use in this chapter.
However, and especially from a more applied point of view, we argue that risks and uncertainties
are not completely perceived “in here” either (in our psyche). This can be seen clearly when we
break down the notion of total risk and uncertainty into its components and discuss “Resident
Risks” below. We then believe the truth about the sources of risks probably lie somewhere
between “out there” and “in here”. To get our discussion started, we define risk and uncertainty
as follows.

14

Needless to say that the standard finance theory definitions of risk have no relevance at all to a great majority of
entrepreneurial finance problems where there is little or no historical data “out there” to be measure in the first
place! For example, in case of startups almost all the data are projected data and are contained in a highly guarded
Business Plan.

According to Olsen, culture, including trust, is another source of risk. However, in this writing we will limit our
discussions to the factors stated in above.

<-----Page 7----->Total (Perceived) Risk and Uncertainty = “Resident Risks” + or – “Behavioral Risks”

Resident Risk: Risk as the “Other Side of a Business Opportunity Coin”
First note that due to the nature of the topic, I use the terms risk and uncertainty interchangeably
throughout this writing. Second, for simplicity and illustration I use the decision to launch a
brand new business venture, a business opportunity, as an example. Now think of “Resident
Risks” as the type of risks that actually resides in, or are native to, a given business opportunity;
without which the opportunity would be riskless. (Riskless in the sense of a short-term U.S.
Treasury Bill.) In other words, in our example, risk is the “other side of a business opportunity
coin”.
I especially use the coin analogy to make the point that Resident Risk (RR) automatically comes
with any selected and implemented business opportunity; just like throwing a coin that comes
with it known odds of success/fail. Of course, measuring success/failure rates in business are
much more complicated; but still doable. Another analogy for the definition is water and the
wetness of water. That is, one cannot exist without the other; and you know if you throw yourself
in the water, you will get wet, and the odds are 100% in your favor! Just like tossing a coin with
well defined outcomes, we can also define the possible outcomes in a launch decision. For
example, success can mean reaching $5M sales in three years and failure can mean not reaching
that sales threshold by the third year.
Additionally, dissecting Total Perceived Risk as such has another theoretical and empirical
advantage. It allows us to have a significant portion of the total risk measurable and concentrate
on its elusive component- the behavioral risk component.
Determinants of Resident Risk
In anticipation of making the resident risk component operational and consequently measurable,
we can proceed as follows. Imagine yourself as an entrepreneur who has not only found a unique
business opportunity, but has also developed a non-working prototype of her product and wants
to launch the business by first perfecting the prototype and then mass producing and selling the
finished product. She also needs capital to do all the above. You may also imagine yourself at the
other side of the transaction and as a venture capitalist who is considering funding such an
entrepreneur. Given this background, we can list and define the following factors as the key
determinants of residual risk.

8

<-----Page 8----->a. Commercialization and Technology risk factor- the risk of taking an opportunity or a
prototype and turning it into a fully functional product or service that consumers will pay
to use it,
b. Market risk factor - whether or not a profitable and sustainable market will emerge for
the envisioned product/service,
c. Management risk factor - whether or not the entrepreneur behind the opportunity and her
team will succeed in executing the envisioned business strategies
d. Financing risk factor - whether or not the entrepreneur and her team can raise the needed
capital on a timely basis to execute the envisioned business strategies, and finally,
e. Macro risk factors- including regulatory risks, environmental risks, etc.
The above risks certainly exit “out there” in and around any business opportunity. However, they
do not exist in vacuum as there must be a real asset in the physical world to contain such native
risks. And that is exactly why I refer collectively to these risks as Resident Risks.19
Behavioral Risks
The “Behavioral Risk” component is mainly shaped by the editing, evaluating, and affect
processes as described earlier in this chapter. As shown by the risk equation, behavioral risks can
either increase or decrease the total risk. The increase part seems very intuitive by the standards
of the traditional finance; although that is not the case for the decrease part as it can easily be
ignored as a behavioral “anomaly”! To a behavioral economist however, the decrease is a result
of the affect heuristic.
Furthermore, according to the proposed risk framework and the theories behind it – Prospect
Theory and Affect Heuristic – the behavioral risk portion of the total risk is our own creation. In
other words, when we consider a set of opportunities for evaluation and final selection, we
automatically, and possibly unknowingly, construct a portion of the risks that involve all those
opportunities. Given the current state of brain technology, this is the type of risk that is very
hard, if not impossible, to quantify.
Behavioral Risk Processes

19

Resident Risks can become the only risks, and therefore the only “real” risks, if we take all the heuristics out of
the simple equation suggested in this section. In such a case, Total Risk is equivalent to the Total Risk under
standard finance paradigm, and measurable. But again, to take the behavioral risk component out is equivalent to
assuming a “mind of God” for a normal earth-bound human being.

9

<-----Page 9----->Although discussion on making the behavioral risk component operational is well above and
beyond the present writing; however we can still list and describe the four underlying processes
that produce it as follows.
a.
b.
c.
d.

Framing processes
Evaluation processes
Affective processes, and
Other non-Affect processes like Overconfidence, Availability, Anchoring, etc.

All the above processes are as described in this chapter.

3.3 Individual Decision Making in Highly Uncertain Entrepreneurial Settings:
A Discussion and Some Final Thoughts
By building upon the Prospect Theory and Affect heuristic, we argued how the editing and
evaluation phases, coupled with affect’s capability of producing perceptual judgments, can
influence the perception and judgment of the entrepreneurs and VCs regarding the business
opportunities that they consider in the course of their businesses. Moreover, by building upon
Slovic and Olsen’s notion of risk that all risks are perceptual, and introducing the real-life
aspects of risk and risk taking into the discussion, we proposed a two-component risk formula
that contained both objective and subjective elements of risk.
Based on what was said in above, and given my own personal experiences as a real-life
entrepreneur, investor, and consultant to 100s of entrepreneurs in California, we argue that an
entrepreneur:
a. Bases her final decision mainly on the perceived gains and losses of the venture
opportunity that she has eventually selected as a result of her search for similar
opportunities; and more importantly,
b. The finalized and selected business opportunity already has a level of risk and
uncertainty residing in it that the entrepreneur feels comfortable about.
Proposition “a’ is based on the Prospect Theory; and proposition “b” is based on both the now
familiar Affect heuristic and the “Homeostasis Principle”, or “Comfort Hypothesis”, as
mentioned in below.

10

<-----Page 10----->Moreover, proposition “b” is a simple extension of the two-component risk equation just
mentioned and discussed in details earlier. Built in proposition “b” is the observation that in the
real life, business risks automatically come with business opportunities; just like the coin toss
analogy20.
More importantly, we may already have support from the fields of psychology and neuroscience
especially for the more significant proposition “b”. Specifically, on the neuroscience side,
Konopka and Ackley (2010) state that “actions are initiated to maintain an individually defined
level of homeostasis. In other words, one may try to answer questions such as: What is my level
of discomfort?” And on the psychology side and along the same line, Neace (2010) argues that
“… uncertainty creates a state of psychological discomfort that motivates the decision maker to
move the decision from a state of uncertainty toward a state of certainty in order to reduce the
discomfort created …”21.

4. Summary and Some Suggestions for Future Research
In this chapter, we discussed three central decisions in entrepreneurial finance and made the case
for applying the behavioral finance theories and concepts to better understand these decisions
and the underlying processes. We also introduced some new concepts such as “Perception
Asymmetry”, “Resident Risk”, and a preliminary behavioral risk framework to further facilitate
discussions on related risks and uncertainties. This was done with the belief that if we can better
understand the issues, we would have a better chance of improving the decision making
processes.
Although the discussions in this chapter did not lead to any specific model, but we certainly hope
the theory- and experience-based thoughts and concepts provide a starting point for future
theoretical and empirical works on the topic. What follows are some suggestions for future
research relative to the stated problems.
a.

One immediate and relatively easy-to-implement work is to survey a group of
entrepreneurs and see if they behave as hypothesized in this chapter. My instinct and
first-hand experiences tell me that they do; however I never conducted a formal study.
b. The same exact experiment in above can be conducted in case of VCs. Again, my view is
that VCs also behave as proposed in this chapter; but this needs to be verified too.

20

Another fact regarding risk taking in real life goes like this, and every honest venture consultant will tell the same
to her/his clients: “The only way to know the risk is to take the risk!”
21
See Konopka and Ackley, chapter 5, and Neace, ch 6, both in this book.

11

<-----Page 11----->c. Related to item be above and as compared with entrepreneurs, I suspect VC’s Total Risk
is much influenced by the resident risks than the behavioral risks. In other words, VCs
are expected to be less affective when it comes to investment decisions. On the other
hand and by definition22, entrepreneurs behave the opposite way; i.e., more affectively.
d. Finally, and this is where the real challenge is, work can be done to make the proposed
risk equation operational so that it could be tested for further analysis and possible use in
decision making. Selection and/or development of a suitable methodology that can
process both objective and subjective risks and uncertainties is a first major in such
direction. A possible starting point on methodology is Lewis’ (1980) “The Principal
Principle”23

22

This follows from the fact that entrepreneurs are passionate individuals. Such notion of passion is consistent
with the use of the term “baby” in the English language to describe one’s project or initiative. Moreover, passion is
a key factor that experienced VCs look for in an entrepreneur when they consider different venture proposals.

<-----Page 12----->Appendix

A. The Prospect Theory
According to Prospect Theory (PT), there are two distinct phases to each decision- an initial
phase called Editing or Framing; and a second phase called Evaluation phase.
1.1.The Editing or Framing Phase.
According to Kahneman and Tversky (KT), framing effects in decision situations arise when
different imagery and descriptions of the same problem highlight different aspects of the decision
outcomes. Choices often depend on the manner in which alternatives are framed (described) and
presented to us; something not allowed in the Expected Utility (EU) theory. The role of the
initial editing phase is to organize the possible options for the purpose of simplifying the
evaluation phase and consequently making it easier to select the final option that has the highest
value to the decision maker.
In other words, framing leads to a representation of the acts, outcomes, and contingencies that
are associated with a particular choice problem like the choice to pursue a specific venture
opportunity by an entrepreneur. Moreover, often time the entrepreneur does not have the basic
information about different choices available to her/him; or at least all the available choices are
not that clear to him. In such cases she has to actually figure out and possibly mentally construct
what her options are; a process that is referred to as the Opportunity Recognition phase in the
traditional entrepreneurship literature and practice24.
1.2. Editing Operations
24

In a working paper on this topic I argue that by mentally constructing different opportunities and in preparation
for the next phase of evaluation – where she/he select a specific opportunity for starting a business based on the
chosen opportunity – the entrepreneur is effectively, knowingly or knowingly, creating the matching risk that
she/he will be comfortable with when and if the envisioned venture is actually launched; pending the needed
financing. Otherwise, she/he will not take the next steps of actually starting the venture, including starting his
search for a financial backer. Moreover, such constructed and perceived risk – which is unique to the entrepreneur
behind the given opportunity – will be discussed along with the real uncertainty that certainly exists in the selected
opportunity; the risk that is referred to in the literature as “risk out there”. For the lack of a better term, I refer to
this “risk out there” as the “resident risk” or the risk that resides in any new opportunity; as there is no such a
thing as riskless opportunity. I will also argue that the new term (new as far as I know) is not a tautological
argument as it is the next natural step in better understanding how at least entrepreneurs make decisions in the
real life and how their financiers would have their own perceived risk which will be different from the one seen by
the entrepreneurs and possibly different from the “resident risk” or “native risk” . Finally we hypothesize that the
VC’s envisioned/perceived risk is closer to the real risk- the “resident risk” or “native risk” - than that of the
entrepreneur.

13

<-----Page 13----->The editing phase also involves the application of a number of operations by the decision maker
as briefly outlined in below.
Coding. Coding is simply the categorization of the outcomes in terms of gains and losses; and
not as final states of wealth which is an underlying assumption used by the EU model.
Furthermore, gains and losses are defined relative to the status quo or the reference point. Ruling
out any “psychic income” for entrepreneurs and VCs, the reference point for them corresponds to
their current assets or their current value of their portfolios. Moreover, by moving the reference
point, outcomes may be categorized
Combination. This refers to the tendency to add together the probabilities of choices that present
identical outcomes. For example, the prospect (500, .25; 500, .25) is reduced to (500, .50) to
facilitate evaluation.
Segregation. This is where the riskless component of a prospect is separated from its risky
component.
Cancellation. This is the tendency to discard common outcome-probability choices. . For
example, and using KT’s example, the choices (200, 0.2; 100, 0.5; 20, 0.3) and (200, 0.2; 300,
0.4; -50, 0.4) can be reduced to choices (100, 0.5; 20, 0.3) and (300, 0.4; -50, 0.4).
1.3.The Evaluation Phase.
A second phase where acts, related contingencies, and outcomes for each decision choice are
evaluated. In this phase, the edited prospects, such as business opportunities, are evaluated and
the business opportunity with the highest value is selected. The Value Function as formulated in
what follows will be used to assign values to each prospect or opportunity.
To see this, consider a gamble with two outcomes: x with probability p, and y with
probability 1 − p; where x ≥ 0 ≥ y. Also assume an initial level of wealth (W) is our reference
point in this example. According to PT, value of the gamble (or prospect) is
V = π (p) v (x) + π (1 − p) v (y);
where π is a probability-weighing function and v is value of an outcome. KT’s value function is
shown in Figure 2.1 in below.
Place figure 2.1 about here
The value in PT is defined in terms of expected gains and losses and not in terms of

B. The Affect Heuristic
According to Finucane, et al, the affect heuristic refers to the way in which subjective
impressions of "goodness" or "badness" can act as a heuristic, capable of producing fast
perceptual judgments, and also systematic biases. For example, as Ganzach has demonstrated,
• Stocks perceived as "good" were judged to have low risks and high return;
• Stocks perceived as "bad" were judged to have low return and high risks.
That is, for unfamiliar stocks, perceived risk and perceived return were negatively
correlated, as predicted by the affect heuristic. For familiar stocks, perceived risk and perceived
return were positively correlated; riskier stocks were expected to produce higher returns, as
predicted by ordinary economic theory.

C. Other Heuristics and Biases
When faced with huge amount of data and information and an array of decision
problems, people do not do and in fact are not humanly capable of doing the rather complex
optimization calculations that are expected of them under standard finance theory. Instead, they
rely on a limited number of cognitive strategies or heuristics that will simplify the complex
scenarios faced by them in making decisions. We can think of heuristics as information
processing shortcuts that mainly result from one’s experiences in a field of work. Of course, such
simplifying shortcuts are productive; until we consider that heuristics, by nature are imperfect,
and, consequently, will result in biases and errors.
We furthermore have to add that, in traditional theory, unsystematic biases are expected
to average out at the market level and consequently have no effect on asset prices. However, the
behavioralists argue that both heuristics and biases are in fact systematic, thereby potentially
lasting for long periods of time and affecting prices accordingly.
Tversky and Kahneman (TK, 1974), as well as other new researchers, have brought to the
attention of the finance professionals a number of such systematic biases as follows.
15

<-----Page 15----->1. Representativeness (Similarity)
According to TK (TK, 1974), many of the probabilistic questions that people are
concerned with can be characterized by, “What is the probability that object A belongs to class
B? What is the probability that event A originates from process B? etc.” To answer questions
like these, people utilize the representative heuristics, in which probabilities are evaluated by the
degree to which A resembles B. For example, when A is highly representative of B, the
probability that A originates form B is judged to be high.
In such cases the representative heuristic assists in evaluating the probabilities dealing
with objects or processes A and B. As an example, when A is highly representative of B, the
probability that A originates from B is judged to be high; and so forth. The problem is that
representativeness (similarity) should not affect the judgment of probability. What should be
considered in the judgment to probability is “prior probability” or “base rate.” However, the
latter is not the case in practice. (violation of Bayes’ rule).
The Representativeness Heuristic in a Nutshell:
•
•

The "representativeness heuristic" is a built-in feature of the brain for producing rapid
probability judgments, rather than a consciously adopted procedure.
As humans we are not aware of substituting judgment of representativeness for judgment
of probability.

2. Availability
To understand this judgment heuristic, we just need to know that people
disproportionately recall the salient events, those that are very recent and/or those that are/were
emotionally involved with especially in the recent past. The more salient an event is, the more
likely the probability that we can recall that event. The result is that this sort of bias prevents us
from considering other potential and related outcomes. For example, one may assess the risk of
getting mugged in New York City (NYC) by recalling such incidences among friends and
family. Under availability, people search their memories for relevant information.
The problem, however, is that not all memories are equally retrievable/available and this
leads to error in judgment. For example, more recent incidences and more salient events (getting
mugged in NYC) will weigh more heavily and will lead to prediction biases and distort the
judgment or estimate.

estimates of risk.
3. Anchoring, Adjustment, and Contamination
According to TK (1974), when forming estimates and predictions, people usually start
with some initial arbitrary value and adjust away from it. Also, people make estimates by starting
from an initial value that is adjusted to yield the final answer. The initial value may be suggested
by the formulation of the problem or it may be the result of a partial calculation. Regardless, TK
argue that “adjustments are typically insufficient”, and “Different starting points yield different
estimates which are biased toward the initial value”. This is anchoring. Anchoring happens
when the starting point is given to the subject; as well as when the subject bases her estimate on
the result of some incomplete computation.
The Anchoring Heuristic in a Nutshell:
• Information that is visibly irrelevant still anchors judgments and contaminates guesses.
When people start from information known to be irrelevant and adjust until they reach a
plausible-sounding answer, they under-adjust.
• People under-adjust more severely in cognitively busy situations and other manipulations
that make the problem harder.
• People deny they are anchored or contaminated, even when experiment shows they are.
• These effects are not diminished or are only slightly diminished by financial incentives,
explicit instruction to avoid contamination, and real-world situations.
Contamination Effects:
It turns out that almost any information could work its way into a cognitive judgment.
(Chapman and Johnson 2002); and you cannot decrease Anchoring or Contamination effects
either (Tversky and Kahneman 1974) and (Wansink et. al. 1998).
4. Overconfidence Heuristics- and Calibration
People typically have great confidence in judgments based upon them. For example,
events to which subjects assigned a probability of 2% happened 42.6% of the time!
5. Hindsight Heuristics
Hindsight bias is when subjects, after learning the eventual outcome, give a much higher
estimate for the predictability of that outcome than subjects who predict the outcome without
advance knowledge. Hindsight bias is sometimes called the I-knew-it-all-along effect. Hindsight
17

<-----Page 17----->bias is important in legal cases, where a judge or jury must determine whether a defendant was
legally negligent in failing to foresee a hazard (Sanchiro 2003).
6. Others- Black Swan Phenomenon
As Taleb has coined the term and discussed this phenomenon is much detail, sometimes
most of the variance in a process comes from exceptionally rare, exceptionally huge events.
Consider a financial instrument that earns $10 with 98% probability, but loses $1000 with 2%
probability; it's a poor net risk, but it looks like a steady winner. As another example, why did
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) borrow leverage of $125 billion against $4.72 billion
of equity, almost ensuring that any Black Swan would destroy them?
Heuristics and Biases: Evidence and Implications- some examples
•

Implication for performance-based management contracts: People/managers will prefer
performance-based incentives schemes more often than standard theory predicts. This can
be attributed to the overconfidence trait. Due to overconfidence, managers prefer riskier
projects because they think they can beat the odds. This goes against the standard theory;
which predicts that, as output variance increases, principals should offer less outputsensitive contracts to agents because, under standard theory, agents are assumed to dislike
risk. According to Camerer and Lovallo (1999) there is some evidence in support of this
phenomenon.

•

Implication for stock selections due to availability bias: People easily recall the
information that has recently arrived, especially in the media and corporate releases; and
their memory is fresh with their broker’s/advisor’s recommendations. According to a
study, stocks with very high level of press coverage underperformed in the subsequent
two years.

•

Implication for asset valuation due to anchoring bias. In a study done in the field of real
estate, subjects were asked to give their opinions on the appraisal value, appropriate
listing price, and the lowest price they would accept if they were the seller. This was done
after they had been given detailed and identical information about the house they had
been shown for such a purpose. The only information that was changed in this study was
the asking price (the anchoring factor). The result of this study showed individual
valuations of houses were directly related to the asking price given to them.

Note: The value function is defined by gains and losses on deviations from a reference point,
where the function is concave for gains and convex for losses. This function is steeper for losses
than gains (loss aversion). This means a loss causes a greater feeling of pain than a joy caused by
