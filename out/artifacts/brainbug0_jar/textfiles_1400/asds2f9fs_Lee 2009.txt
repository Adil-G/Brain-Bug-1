This paper analyzes the way a ﬁrm can control its entry timing after missing the opportunity to pioneer
an emerging market. The ﬁndings, based on a panel of 224 potential entrants, reveal that alignment with
invention and commercialization capabilities of early entrants has positive effects on the timing of ‘fastsecond’ entry. When comparing invention and commercialization capabilities, the latter dominate. In
addition, subsequent alignment as the market develops, as opposed to initial alignment at the beginning
of market emergence, is associated with the reconﬁguration of capabilities and is the more important
determinant of entry timing.

1. Introduction
A great deal of previous research has (a) analyzed the
(dis)advantages associated with the timing of market entry
(Bohlmann et al., 2002; Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988, 1998;
Robinson et al., 1992), (b) considered the prospects of entering
after the early entrants have established a growing market (Cho
et al., 1998; Shamsie et al., 2004; Shankar et al., 1998; Zhang and
Markman, 1998), and (c) examined whether and when to follow
early entrants into a market (Fuentelsaz et al., 2002; Mitchell,
1989; Schoenecker and Cooper, 1998). Despite this research, aspects
that allow a ﬁrm to control its timing of market entry as a follower remain elusive. A recent development in market evolution
literature suggests that the strategies of ﬁrms can indeed vary
systematically across the industry lifecycle. For example, becoming a ‘fast-second mover’ has been argued as a way to allow
ﬁrms that missed the opportunity to pioneer an emerging market to participate in growing the market (Markides and Geroski,
2005). Unlike second movers who are low-cost producers of the
dominant design, fast-second movers do not wait for the dominant design to arise. Instead, fast-second movers are advised to
time their market entry such that they transform a niche market into a mass market (Markides and Geroski, 2005). Moreover,
for entrants that missed the opportunity to be pioneers, enter-

ing before the number of ﬁrms in the market increases sharply
has been found to be associated with a higher chance of survival
(Agarwal and Bayus, 2004). However, little research has analyzed
what would allow a ﬁrm to control its entry timing so as to
compete more effectively in a certain stage of the industry life
cycle.
Until recently, the kinds of ﬁrm capabilities required to compete effectively across the various stages of the industry life cycle
had not been explored rigorously (McGahan et al., 2004). Research
on the relationship between business strategy and the industry
life cycle has mainly focused on the development of ﬁrm capabilities that can shape the structure of competitive interaction. Rather
than focusing on generalized principles of competitive interaction,
recent work has started to examine how ﬁrms leverage and adapt
existing capabilities and build the required capabilities in the face
of technological and regulatory change (e.g. Lacatera et al., 2004;
Macher and Mowery, 2004; Mukherjee et al., 2004). However, no
study has compared the different types of capabilities regarding
their relative effects on ﬁrm performance. A gap remains in the
understanding of the tradeoff between different capabilities on
which potential entrants, under time pressure and resource constraint, can optimize investments in reconﬁguring capability for
market entry. To ﬁll part of the research gap, we compare two
types of capabilities and explain their relative effects, pre- and
post-reconﬁguration, on the timing of entry into an emerging market.
In order to compare the relative effects of capabilities preand post-reconﬁguration, we propose a ﬁrm-speciﬁc time-varying

<-----Page 1----->G.K. Lee / Research Policy 38 (2009) 86–95

capability relevance framework in this paper. Firstly, we create
the concept of capability relevance, which is the projection of a
potential entrant’s organizational capabilities that align with the
pioneers who serve as a comparison group. Using the structural
patterns of the pioneers’ patent and product portfolios, we construct two similarity indices to separately capture the invention
and commercialization capabilities that are required to enter the
emerging market: one is the similarity index of invention based
on patent portfolios and the other is the similarity index of commercialization based on product portfolios. Secondly, we use the
indices to measure two types of capability relevance, including
invention and commercialization. The more similar a potential
entrant’s invention or commercialization capabilities are with
respect to the capabilities required to enter, the more the potential entrant’s capability relevance is aligned. Thirdly, we capture the
dynamics of capability relevance by tracking the extent of a potential entrant’s capability reconﬁguration annually with respect to
market entry requirements. As a ﬁrm’s capabilities become reconﬁgured with respect to market entry requirements, the alignment
in invention and commercialization may shift from their initial levels, which are measured at the beginning of market emergence.
This ﬁrm-speciﬁc time-varying capability relevance framework
allows us to use a panel design to compare the relative effects of
a ﬁrm’s invention and commercialization capabilities on performance.
The empirical results from panel data report two important
ﬁndings. Firstly, the relevance of capabilities in commercialization
rather than that in invention has a larger effect on the likelihood
of entry. A one-standard-deviation increase in the capability relevance in commercialization leads to a 93% increase in the likelihood
of entry. In contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in the capability relevance in invention contributes to a 42% increase. The
capability relevance in commercialization rather than that in invention also has a higher level of statistical signiﬁcance. Therefore, the
dominant determinant of entry timing is the potential entrant’s
commercialization capabilities that are relevant to market entry
requirements. In contrast, the general scope of the patent portfolio (the number of technology classes that the patents cover) does
not affect the likelihood of entry. The general scope of the product portfolio (the number of categories that the products cover)
also does not affect entry likelihood. Secondly, the effect of the
relevance in commercialization becomes stronger over time. A
ﬁrm’s initial level of relevance in commercialization at the time
of market emergence does not affect its likelihood of entry. Without capability reconﬁguration, a potential entrant’s relevance in
the year when the market emerged most likely remains at its
initial level throughout the course of market development. However, after reconﬁguration, the relevance in commercialization
becomes the most important determinant of the likelihood of
entry.
The research policy implication of our ﬁndings is that if a
potential entrant needs to make a tradeoff between investing in
invention versus commercialization capabilities, it should focus
on the match in commercialization capabilities with respect to
the market entry requirements. In practice, a ﬁrm can enhance
the competitive advantage of its unique resources by paying more
attention to the pioneers’ product portfolios rather than their
patent portfolios in devising a concrete direction for capability
reconﬁguration. This paper provides a framework and associated analytical tools for gaining a better understanding about
the antecedents of entry timing for the R&D managers of established ﬁrms. As the managers make investment tradeoffs, our study
informs the design of a more concrete plan in reconﬁguring the
ﬁrms’ capabilities to deliver the promise of a fast-second strategy.

2. Literature review and hypothesis development
2.1. Market evolution and its implications for organizational
capability
Life cycle theory has long postulated that industries evolve
through distinct phases and that each phase is associated with
a different basis of competition. The basis of competition shifts
from product innovation to process innovation as an industry
evolves (Utterback and Abernathy, 1975; Utterback and Suarez,
1993; Utterback, 1994; Klepper, 1996, 1997; Adner and Levinthal,
2001). The model proposed by Utterback and Abernathy (1975)
maintains that early after market emergence, ﬁrms compete based
upon product differentiation. The focus of ﬁrm investments is on
developing new product features and understanding what consumers want. However, as the market matures and consumer wants
become more deﬁned, ﬁrms may shift their focus towards competition in cost and economies of scale. The focus of ﬁrm investments is
on manufacturing and other processes that make production operations more specialized and efﬁcient. This model assumes a clear
ordering between product and process innovation (DeBresson and
Townsend, 1981). It posits that ﬁrms will tend to ignore production process and cost control until the emergence of the dominant
design when the product design becomes ﬁxed.
A key implication of the changing life cycle is that each basis of
competition requires a different type of organizational capability.
For incumbents, surviving a shakeout requires a transition from a
focus on R&D and product innovation to a focus on operational efﬁciency and production processes (Utterback and Abernathy, 1975;
Anderson and Tushman, 1990). A successful transition from a focus
on product innovation to process innovation has been found to
affect ﬁrm survival (Suarez and Utterback, 1995). For potential
entrants, the changing life cycle implies that the determinants of
market entry vary systematically across the industry lifecycle. Market entry opportunities are available to ﬁrms with capabilities that
match the entry requirements.
In the context of fast-second entry (Markides and Geroski,
2005), the basis of competition shifts from functionality and
performance to price and quality as a market evolves from the
introduction stage to the growth stage. The pioneers initiate a niche
market by embedding technological inventions into a new product.
The mastery of technical knowledge and engineering skills enables
the pioneers to attract the early consumers with product attributes
such as functionality and performance. In contrast, the fast-second
entrants grow the niche market into a mass market by delivering
an economically priced product. To attract the average consumers,
the price of the product has to be acceptable to the masses. The
integration of engineering, production, value-chain management,
marketing and ﬁnancial control enables the fast-second entrants
to reduce the cost and price of the product. In addition to bringing
down the price to a level that is acceptable to mainstream customers, the fast-second entrants also improve the quality of the
product and consumer satisfaction. Moreover, fast-second entrants
may grow the market by promoting the symbol and status associated with the consumption to average consumers. When the
product gains acceptance by the mass market, sales take off and
the market grows rapidly. As an illustrative example, the pioneers
that created the market of portable computers (Osborne and Apple)
used technical performance and features as their basis of competition. The fast-second entrants (e.g. IBM) emphasized price and size
as their distinct basis of competition (Markides and Geroski, 2005,
p. 93).
Despite the general capability requirements for each stage of the
life cycle, little research has compared the relative effectiveness of
different types of capabilities that would allow a ﬁrm to control its

<-----Page 2----->88

entry timing as a market evolves from the introduction stage to the
growth stage. Some researchers recommend that ﬁrms broaden the
scope of upstream activities while they retain focus in downstream
activities. Broad technological competence and narrow product
diversiﬁcation have been shown to contribute to the rise of Japanese
semiconductor ﬁrms in the 1980s and the resurgence of the American semiconductor ﬁrms (Langlois and Steinmueller, 2000). Quite
the opposite, others suggest that when transforming technology
into highly demanded products, maintaining a broad scope is less
important in the technology than in the value network (Christensen
and Rosenbloom, 1995). Still others argue that the exact composition of the core knowledge bundle and the product market portfolio
largely emerges from a series of autonomous initiatives (Burgelman
and Doz, 2001). The emergent nature suggests that the scope of
invention and commercialization capabilities may not be subject to
planning. Since existing research offers contradicting recommendations for ﬁrm-level research policy, what exactly allows a ﬁrm to
control entry timing remains elusive.
2.2. The relevance of organizational capabilities and the timing of
market entry
To inform ﬁrm-level research policy on the tradeoff between
different types of capabilities, we develop a framework that can
help ﬁrms optimize their investments in reconﬁguring capabilities
for market entry. As a market evolves, potential entrants evaluate
the extent to which their capabilities are relevant with respect to
the requirements of entry and make decisions about what aspects
of the pioneers to emulate. The cost of learning partly depends on
how close the new knowledge and capabilities are to the existing
knowledge and capabilities (Helfat and Raubitschek, 2000), so a
ﬁrm’s capability relevance with respect to the entry requirements
may affect its timing of market entry.
Empirical evidence shows that the better the match is between
a ﬁrm’s relevant experience prior to entry and the market entry
requirements, the earlier the ﬁrm enters the market. For example, ﬁrms with radio production experience are found to enter
the market of television (TV) receivers earlier than those without
that experience (Klepper and Simons, 2000). However, among R&D,
marketing, and distribution, which dimension of a radio producer’s
experience was more useful to entering the television market earlier? Invention and commercialization are two types of capabilities
that have been shown to affect the development of new knowledge in related areas (Helfat, 1997). Each type of capability leads to
a speciﬁc path that potential entrants can emulate. Therefore we
propose a hypothesis for each type of capability. Ultimately the relative importance between the two will be determined by empirical
evidence.

applications result from the recombined prior art, as well as from
the knowledge and experience absorbed from related patents. The
potential entrants may ﬁle and receive patents across multiple technology classes. Among the technology classes, we assume that some
are related to the focal technology class in which the pioneers serving the emerging market have many patents. When the potential
entrants have patents in technology classes that are related to the
focal class, the potential entrants are likely to have invention capabilities that are relevant with respect to market entry requirements.
Hence,
Hypothesis 1. The higher a ﬁrm’s relevance of capabilities in
invention, the higher its likelihood of market entry.
2.2.2. Capability relevance in commercialization
Commercialization capabilities require operating routines for
developing and producing products, managing sales force and
distribution channels, providing customer service, maintaining
reputation and brand recognition, and participating in setting
industry standards and practices. The search routines in technology commercialization seek to integrate the operating routines
with complementary assets. According to Teece (1986, 2006),
complementary assets may include competitive manufacturing,
distribution, service, and complementary technologies. New applications result from the integration as well as the knowledge
and experience absorbed from related markets. As an example,
Cisco Systems has an extensive set of complementary assets that
aid commercialisation—a distribution network, brand equity and
installed base, and a standardized New Product Introduction process that enables relatively smooth transitions from prototype to
market (O’Reilly, 1998).
In addition, the complementary assets employed in serving a
ﬁrm’s existing product markets that are related to the emerging
market can be recombined to serve the emerging market. Imitators
can make a diversifying entry by leveraging their complementary
assets (see He et al., 2006 for a case study of entry in the mobile
telecommunications market). They found that one approach for
imitators to catch up with the ﬁrm that was the ﬁrst to commercialize a new product design concept is by deploying complementary
assets along a new technological trajectory. We argue that when
ﬁrms serve the same product markets that are related to the product market served by the pioneers, the ﬁrms are likely to have more
complementary assets and thus more commercialization capabilities that are relevant with respect to the market entry requirements.
Hence
Hypothesis 2. The higher a ﬁrm’s relevance of capabilities in commercialization, the higher its likelihood of market entry.
3. Methods

2.2.1. Capability relevance in invention
As a form of new knowledge creation, an invention requires
operating routines for conducting research and developing prototypes. The pioneers’ inventions reveal the opportunity-rich
areas and/or the bottleneck problems. As an example, the pioneers’ patents leave a paper trail documenting the codiﬁcation
of their new knowledge and capabilities gained from exploring
the emerging market. Although the patents may deter entry, their
unintended consequence to the potential entrants is inspiring
new ideas, inducing substitute technologies (through “inventing
around” an important patent), and providing a basis for benchmarking (Granstrand, 2005).
More importantly, the paper trail shows the requirements of
novel, non-obvious, and useful inventions. When the potential
entrants cite the pioneers’ patents as prior art, they are likely
to build on the knowledge and capabilities of the pioneers. New

3.1. Empirical context
The empirical context is voice/data convergence, which is the
convergence of telephony communications and computer networking technologies (cf. Fai and von Tunzelmann, 2001 on technological
convergence from 1930 to 1990). Combining voice and data leads
to entirely new forms of communication, such as universal messaging (the integration of voice mail and email), teleconferencing,
collaborative applications, and white boarding. New products for
the packet-based networks promise to deliver multi-media (voice,
data, and video) services that, for example, would enhance distance learning, enable just-in-time professional training, increase
worker productivity, and improve collaboration among geographically dispersed individuals for product development. Among
many inventions, network operators and service providers become

interested in networking switches. A networking switch is a highperformance internetworking hardware component that is used to
direct trafﬁc in both the core and the periphery of the Internet.
The timing of entry into the networking switch market is studied
because it is one of the important product markets that emerged in
the 1990s. By the year 2000, the worldwide revenue of the networking switch equipment reached $22 billion USD, with $16.4 billion
USD in the local area segment and $5.6 billion USD in the wide area
segment (International Data and Corporation, 2001a,b).
3.2. Data, samples, and variables
The period of our investigation was from 1989 until the end of
2003, that is, from the beginning of market emergence until the data
collection phase of our study was completed. We used the directory
of “Who Makes What” that is published annually by CorpTech as
the data source for the coding of market entry events. The directory
provides information on product listings by ﬁrm, product code, and
year. From its survey of high-technology manufacturing establishments, CorpTech compiles data from domestic- and foreign-owned
public and private ﬁrms that operate in the United States. For
ﬁrms that have multiple operating units, divisions, or subsidiaries,
including those that come from mergers and acquisitions, we combined the data at the level of the parent company or holding
company. The CorpTech directory is also used as the data source for
a ﬁrm’s annual product portfolio. For a ﬁrm’s annual patent portfolio, we used the NBER U.S. Patent Citations Data File compiled by
Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002) and updated by Hall (2004).
In establishing the market entry requirements, we identiﬁed
eight networking switch producers among the pioneers as a comparison group because these ﬁrms met two criteria. The ﬁrst
criterion is that the producer entered during the beginning stage
of the life cycle. The number of networking switch producers
increased rapidly after 1994 and declined sharply after 2001 (see
Fig. 1). Hence, we consider 1989–1994 as the beginning stage of the
life cycle during which the net rate of entry was signiﬁcantly lower
than that in the subsequent growth stage (cf. Gort and Klepper,
1982). In the subsequent growth stage, the market transitioned
from a niche into a mass market characterized by sales takeoff and
new entry (cf. Agarwal and Bayus, 2002).

The second criterion is that the producer commanded top market shares during the beginning stage of the life cycle. Selecting
producers that command top market shares increases the likelihood that their knowledge and capabilities deﬁne the market
entry requirements. According to International Data Corporation’s reports on segment-speciﬁc data (International Data and
Corporation, 1994, 1996a,b), the combined worldwide market
shares of the eight producers that we identiﬁed were 56% in the
segment of switching hub, 42% in the segment of frame relay
switch, and 56% in the segment of asynchronous transfer mode
wide area network switch during the beginning stage of market
development.
We used all the patents granted to the eight successful pioneers
before and during the beginning stage of the life cycle in order to
establish the entry requirements for invention. The assumption is
that these patents provide information on the relevance between
the focal patent class and other patent classes. The eight producers received a total of 573 patents during 1989–1994, inclusive. Of
these, multiplex communications (Class 370) has the highest share
(12.6%) among a total of 69 classes that their patents cover. For this
reason, we used Class 370 as the focal class in creating the interpatent-class similarity index. In comparison, we used the product
portfolios of the eight producers in their entry year to establish the
entry requirements for commercialization. The assumption is that
the product categories produced by the successful pioneers during
their year of entry provide information on the relevance between
the focal product category and other product categories. The eight
producers had products across 21 categories. Of these, networking
switch (TEL-NW-CS) is the focal category that we used to create the
inter-product-category similarity index.
With the relevant patent classes and product categories, we generated a population of potential entrants that met two criteria: (1)
the ﬁrm was established prior to the emergence of the networking
switch market; and (2) the ﬁrm has received a patent under the
relevant classes and produced a product under the relevant categories prior to entry or censoring. The ﬁrst criterion allows the
potential entrants enough time to observe market emergence. The
second criterion ensures that each ﬁrm in the pool of potential
entrants has a greater-than-zero degree of relevance for at least
one time period before entry or censoring. Although not all the

Signiﬁcant at 5%.

ﬁrms in the sample enter the market by the end of the observation
period, and some may choose not to enter at all, the established
literature on the timing of market entry suggests that it is reasonable to sample ﬁrms with at least some non-zero probability of
entry (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1998; Helfat and Lieberman,
2002). The eight successful pioneers are excluded from the panel
of potential entrants.
3.3. Dependent variable
The estimation of entry timing follows a hazard-rate framework
under a duration model and speciﬁes the hazard rate of entry as the
probability of ﬁrm entry in the next year, given that the ﬁrm has not
entered in the current year (see Petersen, 1995). Firm entry takes
the value of 1 if ﬁrm n becomes an entrant. For the years prior to
the entry event, the state variable stays constant at 0. To be clear,
the duration variable is the number of years elapsed since market
emergence before a ﬁrm’s entry event or censoring (end of study)
occurs.

normalized count of the pioneers that produce both i and x. The
second step is to calculate each potential entrant’s intensity score
in year t. The intensity score is the proportion of a ﬁrm’s patents
(products) in a particular class (category). Finally, we compute a
potential entrant’s capability relevance in year t as a summation
of the similarity score multiplied by the intensity score across
the patent classes (product categories) and time periods until t.
See Appendix A for detailed descriptions and illustrative examples.
We denote the level of capability relevance in invention and
commercialization at the beginning of market emergence with
Rinvent (0) and Rcommerce (0), respectively. In comparison, we use
Rinvent (t) and Rcommerce (t) to denote a potential entrant’s relevance
in invention and commercialization, respectively, during the course
of market evolution. By specifying both the initial level and the subsequent levels of capability relevance over time in the model, we
control for between-ﬁrm variations while examining within-ﬁrm
variations over time.
3.5. Control variables

3.4. Degree of relevance
Capability relevance has two components: a similarity score
(weight) and an intensity score (share). To calculate a ﬁrm’s similarity score, we start with a pair-wise index of similarity between
the focal patent class (product category) and each patent class
(product category) in the eight pioneers’ portfolios. The pair-wise
index of similarity is constructed as follows: Let Pi be the row vector of binary entries in the patent (product)-ﬁrm matrix (i by j),
where a 1 in cell ij indicates that patent (product) i is present
in ﬁrm j’s patent (product) portfolio, and is 0 if otherwise. Let
x represents the focal patent class (product category). The index
of similarity between i and x is the cosine of the angle between
the vectors Pi and Px . The index of similarity is a real number
between 0 and 1 and it measures the angular separation between
the two vectors. It is easy to see that the index of similarity is the

The basic set of control variables includes the scope of a ﬁrm’s
patent and product portfolio, in addition to a ﬁrm’s size and age.
The scope is measured as the count of patent classes and product
categories in a year. As a proxy for human resources, a ﬁrm’s annual
headcount is expected to increase the likelihood of entry. As a proxy
for structural rigidity, a ﬁrm’s age is expected to decrease the likelihood of entry. Other ﬁrm-level control variables include a ﬁrm’s
annual R&D intensity and proﬁtability (return on assets). The likelihood of entry is expected to be higher for ﬁrms that invest in R&D
and those that have slack resources. Additionally, we control for
the characteristics of the environment. One environmental factor
is the legitimacy of the emerging market and the intensity of market competition. We include the number of producers listed in the
directory in a year as a control variable. Another environmental
factor is time period. We include a constant that is speciﬁc to each

<-----Page 5----->G.K. Lee / Research Policy 38 (2009) 86–95

time period, where the time periods are determined empirically as
judged by the ﬁt of the model.

3.6. Empirical models
We use a hazard model for estimating the timing of entry. The
hazard model has a piecewise exponential speciﬁcation and makes
no assumption about how the hazard rate depends on duration t,
which would require a speciﬁc parametric distribution. With the set

4. Results
When the market of networking switches emerged in 1989, the
average age of the 224 potential entrants in our sample was 22
(S.D. = 21, min = 1, max = 125, see Table 1). To these established ﬁrms,
the networking switch market likely presented an attractive opportunity. The size of the worldwide networking switch market grew
more than 50 fold in the local area segment alone between 1994
and 2000, reaching $16.4 billion USD from less than $327 million
USD before 1994 (International Data and Corporation, 2001a, 1994).
Of the 224 potential entrants, 36 entered the market of networking
switches. A number of the 36 fast-second entrants became the top
vendors in 2000 and captured at least 54% ($3 billion USD) of the
market share in the local area segment as a group (International
Data and Corporation, 2001a).

4.1. Findings
The duration analysis shows that Rinvent (t) has a positive effect
(p-value < .10) the likelihood of entry by potential fast-second
entrants during the growth stage of industry lifecycle (Model 4
in Table 2). Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is supported. The higher the
relevance of capabilities in invention, the higher the likelihood of
entry is. In comparison, neither Rinvent (0) nor the general scope
of the patent portfolio has a signiﬁcant effect on the likelihood
rate of entry. Next, Model 4 shows that Rcommerce (t) has a positive effect (p-value < .01) on the likelihood of entry. As such, we
ﬁnd empirical support for Hypothesis 2. The higher the relevance
of capabilities in commercialization, the higher the likelihood of
entry is. In comparison, neither Rcommerce (0) nor the general scope
of the product portfolio has a signiﬁcant effect on the likelihood of
entry.
In testing the two competing hypotheses, we compare the
effects of capability relevance in invention and commercialization.
As shown in Model 4, the effect of Rcommerce (t) has a much higher
level of statistical signiﬁcance (p-value < .01) compared to Rinvent (t)
(p-value < .10). In addition to the relative difference in the level of
signiﬁcance, Rinvent (t) and Rcommerce (t) also differ in the amount of
impact. A one-standard-deviation increase in Rinvent (t) contributes
to a 42% increase in the likelihood of entry. In contrast, a onestandard-deviation increase in Rcommerce (t) leads to a 93% increase
in the likelihood of entry. Therefore, the relevance of capabilities in
commercialization has a stronger effect on the likelihood of entry
than the relevance of capabilities in invention.
Additionally, we compare the effects of capability relevance preand post- reconﬁguration. At the beginning of market emergence,
the potential entrant’s initial level of capability relevance in invention or commercialization before reconﬁguration is not a signiﬁcant
determinant of the likelihood of entry. In contrast, as the market
evolves, the potential entrants’ subsequent level of capability relevance in invention and commercialization after reconﬁguration
becomes a signiﬁcant determinant of the likelihood of entry. As
such, capability relevance after reconﬁguration is the more important determinant. This ﬁnding complements Lee’s (2008) that ﬁrms
starting with unfavorable initial positions can still achieve early
entry, provided they improve their capability relevance over time.

She showed that, between the initial alignment and subsequent
alignment, the subsequent alignment is the dominant determinant
of entry timing. The initial misalignment is signiﬁcant only in the
sense that it constrains the subsequent alignment. So long as ﬁrms
reconﬁgure their product portfolios (and thus the capability relevance) toward the entrants’, they increase the likelihood of entering
the market early.
Our results strongly suggest that relevance of capabilities in
commercialization after reconﬁguration is the most important
determinant of a potential entrant’s entry timing into an emerging market. By controlling for a ﬁrm’s proﬁtability (return on
assets) and R&D intensity (expenditure in research and development divided by net sales), we eliminate the possibility that
organizational slack or resource allocation to R&D drives our results.
The behavioral theory of the ﬁrm posits that a ﬁrm’s ability to innovate and create new opportunities for above-average returns can be
determined by the availability and control of organizational slack
(Cyert and March, 1963) and the strategic intent to allocate slack to
invention. However, neither the level of proﬁtability nor the intensity of R&D spending at the ﬁrm level has a signiﬁcant effect on
entry timing.
4.2. Construct validity tests
We conduct tests of construct validity to bolster the connection
between the concept of capability relevance and its operationalization. The ﬁrst part of the test is convergent validity, where we
conﬁrm whether the validity of the theoretical construct under
scrutiny is consistent with related constructs. The second part
of the test is discriminant validity, where we conﬁrm whether
the theoretical construct is unrelated to different constructs. The
inference of the relevance concept is logically consistent with a
large body of work using technometrics based on archival data.
For instance, the use of resource similarity to infer relatedness
between industries is an established practice in studying diversiﬁcation. Researchers assume that industry A is more closely related
to industry B if the two industries have more similar resource proﬁles. This assumption implies that the distance between industries
A and B should be different from that between industries A and C
if A and C do not share similar resource proﬁles. Thus, we use the
construct of resource proﬁle similarity in the ﬁrst part of the test
to conﬁrm whether the relevance of capabilities is consistent with
inter-industry relatedness. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
shows that the relevance of capabilities has different mean values
across industries (based on a potential entrant’s standard industry
classiﬁcation code), including the focal industry of the emerging
market. The F statistic in ANOVA for both Rinvent (t) and Rcommerce (t)
are statistically signiﬁcant (p-value = .000). This means that the
measures of capability relevance can capture the distance between
the focal industry and other industries. As such, capability relevance
is consistent with the construct of inter-industry relatedness.
For the second part of the test, the objective is to verify that
the relevance in invention is conceptually and empirically distinct
from the relevance in commercialization. We recognize that the
two measures may not clearly delineate between invention and
commercialization capabilities. For instance, ﬁrms use patents in
multiple ways. As a somewhat effective but limited instrument in
appropriating the returns from R&D, patents serve as an important instrument for blocking competitors’ products, bargaining in
cross-licensing negotiations, and preventing or defending against
infringement suits (Levin et al., 1987). Thus, the measure of relevance in invention based on patent classes may also capture the
relevance in commercialization regarding the management of intellectual property rights and appropriability regime. Analogously,
the measure of relevance in commercialization based on product

categories may also reﬂect the relevance in invention regarding
engineering design and technical speciﬁcations. Despite these concerns, however, the two are empirically distinguishable because
their pair-wise correlation is statistically insigniﬁcant (see Table 1).
In addition, we conduct tests to examine various assumptions on
how quickly a ﬁrm’s capabilities may become obsolete or forgotten.
The results we report are based on the assumption that capabilities
are permanent. This assumption leads to an intensity score that is
based on cumulative patent and product counts in calculating the
share of patents (products) in a particular class (category). Alternatively, we may assume that older capabilities become obsolete or
forgotten. In this case, we use a 5-year rolling window to ﬁlter out
patents whose year of application was 5 years before the current
year as well as product listings that were 5 years before the current
year. In another test, we assume that capabilities last for only 1 year.
This assumption leads to an intensity score that includes only the
patents whose year of application was 1 year prior to the current
year and the product listing that was 1 year prior to the current
year. Our results remain robust under all three assumptions.
The construct validity tests conﬁrm that our measures of capability relevance operationalize what they purport to measure. One
strength of the measures is that they are suitable for analyzing large-scale panel data. In addition, our measures allow for
replication tests because the formulation requires a less contextdependent operationalization and use publicly accessible data (as
opposed to proprietary data that other researchers often do not
have access to). Most importantly, through the measures of capability relevance, we provide a basis of comparison for assessing
the relative effects between two types of capabilities to which
researchers have previously offered contradicting recommendations.
4.3. Robustness checks
We performed several sensitivity tests for robustness checks.
First, we examined how quickly the market entry requirements
inferred from the eight pioneers may become outdated. During
the later stage of market evolution, the combined market shares
of these ﬁrms were 65.9% in the local area segment in 2000 and
61.1% in the wide area segment in 1998 (International Data and
Corporation, 1999, 2001a). Compared to the 56% share they occupied during the beginning stage, the later stage market share data
suggest that these ﬁrms continued to set the entry requirements
throughout the course of market development. Thus, the pioneers’
capabilities continue to serve them as the market evolves and the
entry requirements they established should remain valid.
We also checked the sensitivity of the sampling frame when
creating the pool of potential entrants. We relaxed one criterion
so that as long as the sample has a greater-than-zero relevance
in commercialization, a zero degree of relevance in invention is
accepted. Relaxing the criterion increases the number of potential
entrants to 391, among which 167 have no patents. Our ﬁndings
were robust under the more inclusive sampling frame. In addition,
we used a different sampling criterion in selecting the successful
incumbents for constructing the comparison group. Instead of using
market share as one of the criteria, we used patents. The pioneers
that had patents in 1989–1994 were used to construct the similarity
indices. Changing the criterion led to seven successful pioneers of
which four overlapped with the eight generated with the original
sampling frame. Using the alternate sampling frame leads to the
inclusion of startups, which are likely to have cutting-edge technologies in their patents and are thus better candidates in deﬁning
the market entry requirements for invention. Class 370 remains the
largest technology class representing a 39% share and this conﬁrms
our choice of the focal patent class.

<-----Page 7----->G.K. Lee / Research Policy 38 (2009) 86–95

To check the sensitivity of our results to model speciﬁcation,
we used the Cox model where proportional hazard was assumed.
Our ﬁndings remain signiﬁcant under the Cox model speciﬁcation. Finally, we considered the possibility that the characteristics
of the pioneers’ knowledge and capabilities, such as codiﬁability
and complexity, are associated with the height of the imitation
barriers (Kogut and Zander, 1992). No empirical evidence supports
the hypothesized associations between the time of imitation and
the codiﬁability or complexity of the incumbents’ knowledge and
capabilities (Zander and Kogut, 1995), so we do not include either
codiﬁability or complexity in our analysis.
4.4. Limitations
First, our analysis omits the potential entrants that do not have
any patents or products in the same classes or categories as the pioneers. Thus, our ﬁndings cannot explain the entry timing of ﬁrms
that use radically different designs of technology and product compared to the ones used by the pioneers in creating the market. Even
though we infer the market entry requirements from a wide range
of patent classes and product categories covering 56 SIC codes, we
cannot account for every single background from which a potential
entrant may originate. However, the pool of potential entrants is not
some ‘faceless mass that gives rise to a diffuse – if, at times, overpowering – sense of unease amongst incumbents’ (Geroski, 1991, p.
46). Rather, the pool comes from ‘nearby’ markets, including those
that are vertically related upstream or downstream, those that produce a similar product in a geographically different area, and those
that follow a similar technological trajectory as the host market
(Geroski, 1991). As such, our ﬁndings can be generalized to cover
potential entrants diversifying from most nearby origins.
Secondly, an assumption we make is that the potential entrants
have the will and the skill to observe the pioneers. However, we
do not control for information scarcity or verify the attention
span of the potential entrants. Neither do we address managerial
cognition or perception regarding the size of market opportunity and the potential rate of return that may change over time.
Nevertheless, the assumption is most likely to be valid in an empirical context where the emerging market attracts much attention.
The Internet is a prominent example where a long pre-history of
technical development occurred in relatively small and peripheral
market segments before its dramatic and rapid development in
the mainstream market (Adner and Levinthal, 2002, p. 53). One
way to verify the assumption, as a direction for future research,
is to study how the potential entrants learn from the pioneers.
Inter-organizational relationships such as alliances may affect the
information available to the potential entrants, and thus have
an impact on decision-making. For the timing of market entry,
the network resources derived from the structure, relation, and
composition of a ﬁrm’s strategic alliances present opportunities
and constraints (Lee, 2007). Additionally, creating and maintaining
inter-organizational networks may be difﬁcult and costly. If indirect
observations on the pioneers are sufﬁcient in revealing what constitutes the requirements of market entry, direct contacts between
the potential entrants and the pioneers may not be necessary.
5. Conclusion and discussion
This paper compares two types of capability relevance – invention and commercialization – as the antecedents to the timing of
market entry. The measures of capability relevance capture the
alignment of a ﬁrm’s capabilities with respect to market entry
requirements. The relevance of capabilities in invention and that
in commercialization each have a positive effect on entry timing.
Between the two, however, the relevance in commercialization is

93

dominant. In addition, our ﬁndings highlight the importance of
capability reconﬁguration. The initial level of a potential entrant’s
capability relevance in the year of market emergence is not a strong
predictor of entry timing. However, as the capabilities become
reconﬁgured with respect to the market entry requirements, the
relevance in commercialization arises as the most important determinant of entry timing.
Our ﬁndings have important implications for research on market
entry. While a ﬁrm’s knowledge and capabilities have been shown
to affect its timing of market entry, the way by which ﬁrm capabilities and entry timing are connected is complex and remains
poorly understood (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1998, p. 1113). For
instance, the extent to which a ﬁrm’s resource base retains value in
emerging technical subﬁelds has been shown to affect its timing of
entry into the subﬁelds (Mitchell, 1989). Yet, our ﬁndings highlight
the connection between the stage of market evolution and the type
of capability relevance. As a niche market makes a transition into
a mass market, a ﬁrm can control its entry timing by reconﬁguring
its capabilities with respect to the pioneers and, more speciﬁcally,
by improving its capability relevance in commercialization. In contrast to prior research that focused on the extent of which a ﬁrm’s
resource base retains value, our research emphasizes the extent
of which a ﬁrm’s capabilities can be reconﬁgured toward market
entry requirements. In this paper, we move beyond the more traditional focus of how stocks of unique resources sustain entry barriers
and retain value. Instead, we focus on the processes of capability
reconﬁguration that allow potential entrants to contest entry barriers and control entry timing. By incorporating the processes of
changing capabilities across the ﬁrm-level and the industry-level
during market evolution, our framework contributes to a better
understanding of how investment decisions on the reconﬁguration
of different types of capabilities affects entry timing.
Our ﬁndings stand in contrast to the static argument for the
stock of unique resources as barrier to entry (Lippman and Rumelt,
1982). We argue that through capability reconﬁguration, a potential entrant’s unique resources can be adapted and its competitive
advantage enhanced. The role of a comparison group in devising a concrete direction for capability reconﬁguration has been
neglected so far. One major difference between the fast-second
entrants and the subsequent entrants is the choice of comparison group. The subsequent entrants are more likely to select
their comparison group from ﬁrms that represent the average
of the population (Massini et al., 2005), as opposed to selecting
their comparison group from ﬁrms that deﬁne the market entry
requirements. As the pioneers explore what the market views as a
reasonable trade-off between product performance and production
cost, they generate variations representing different experimentations on cost-performance possibilities. However, only certain
variations are retained by the selection forces that eliminate inferior experiments. In order to gain market acceptance, the potential
entrants have to at least match their offer against those of the pioneers. Our conceptualization of a ﬁrm’s capability relevance and its
operationalization contribute to a better understanding of the role
of successful pioneers as a comparison group for the reconﬁguration of unique resources.
Also, in contrast to earlier research that views market entry as
a head-on technological competition between potential entrant(s)
and a monopolistic incumbent (e.g. Gilbert and Newbery, 1982, on
patent races), our focus on the reconﬁguration of ﬁrm capabilities moves beyond the incumbent’s entry deterring tactics. Instead,
we analyze and compare potential entrant’s routines that would
allow them to contest entry barriers. While the earlier research
that focused on entry deterrence would inform potential entrants
whether to invest in building an intellectual property portfolio to
trade with the incumbent or to directly compete with the incum-

<-----Page 8----->94

bent, our analysis informs the investment decision to undergo
capability reconﬁguration given the cumulative nature of knowledge and the incumbent’s head start in pioneering the market.
Finally, we offer a few comments on the conditions under
which the policy implication of our research would hold. Although
the empirical context of our research is an industry experiencing
technological and market convergence, we believe the research
policy that we recommend can be generalized. Our policy recommendation is valid to the extent that the patent and product
portfolios of successful pioneers provide sufﬁcient information on
entry requirements and to the extent that the entry requirements
remain stable for the stage of life cycle under consideration. These
conditions cover newly emerging industries as well as established
industries undergoing major shifts.

The higher the joint occurrence, the more similar the patent
classes (product categories) are. Six is equal to 1 when i and x have
identical patterns of occurrence across the M entrants’ portfolios. Six
is 0 when i and x do not co-occur at all. Sorting the index in descending order leads to Sx = (S1x , S2x ,. . .,Skx ) where K is the number of
patent classes (product categories) that have a Six greater-thanzero.1
The intensity score is the proportion of a ﬁrm’s patent (product)
count that is under a particular patent class (product category). Cit
is the count of a ﬁrm’s patents whose class is i and whose year
of application is t. Shipment volume by product category is not
reported in the CorpTech directory, so we use the count of a ﬁrm’s
product categories. Ct is the total count of a ﬁrm’s patents whose
year of application is t (product categories that are listed in the
directory in year t).

Appendix A. Calculating capability relevance
A ﬁrm’s capability relevance in year t, R(t), is its similarity score
multiplied by its intensity score. The similarity score, Six , is based
on the cosine index of similarity. The calculation of the cosine index
of similarity starts with a Q by M matrix for each period t, where Q
is the number of patent classes (product categories) in the patent
(product) portfolios of a sample of M entrants. The (i, j)th entry of
the matrix is a binary number, where 1 indicates that ﬁrm j has a
patent (product) under class (category) i and 0 otherwise. Let Pi be
the ith row vector of the matrix, which indicates the presence or
absence of patent class (product category) i across the M entrants’
portfolios. Let Px be the row vector that indicates the presence or
absence of the focal patent class (product category) x across the M
entrants’ portfolios. The cosine index of similarity is a measure of
patent class (product category) i and patent class (product category)
xs joint occurrence in the M entrants’ portfolios.
