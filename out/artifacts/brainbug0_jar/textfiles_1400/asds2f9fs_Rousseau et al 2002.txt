Vallerand and his colleagues (Vallerand & Blanchard, 1999; Vallerand, Blanchard, Koestner, & Gagné, 2001) have recently proposed a new concept of passion. According to
these authors, passion refers to a strong inclination toward an activity that we like, find
important, and in which we invest time. Vallerand et al. have identified two types of
passion: obsessive and harmonious. Obsessive passion refers to an internal pressure that
forces an individual to engage in the activity. Harmonious passion, on the other hand,
refers to an internal force that leads an individual to choose freely to engage in an
activity. While obsessive passion has been shown in some circumstances to lead to negative psychological and physical consequences, harmonious passion generally leads to
positive psychological and physical consequences. The purpose of the present research
was to validate a measure of passion toward gambling: the Gambling Passion Scale
(GPS). The GPS consists of two subscales (obsessive passion and harmonious passion)
comprising five items each. Results from two studies involving a total of 340 participants
revealed satisfactory internal consistency and temporal stability indices, as well as a twoPlease address all correspondence to Robert J. Vallerand, Laboratoire de Recherche sur le

series of partial correlational analyses between the two subscales and scales assessing
behavioral measures related to gambling supported the construct validity of the GPS.
The present results suggest that the GPS is a useful scale for research on gambling.
KEY WORDS: obsessive and harmonious passion; scale validation; gambling behaviors.

Despite its potentially negative consequences for individuals and
society (Ladouceur, Boisvert, Pépin, Loranger, & Sylvain, 1994), gambling is increasingly gaining in popularity. For instance, for the fiscal
year of 1998–1999, Loto-Québec, a state-owned corporation that operates the lotteries, casinos, and bingos in the province of Quebec, reported net profits of (CAN)$1.2 billion. This represents an increase of
(CAN)$111.6 millions over the previous fiscal year (Loto-Québec,
1999). The increased popularity of gambling has also been reported in
several other countries, including the United States (D. A. Abbott &
Cramer, 1993; Volberg, 1996) and New Zealand (M. W. Abbott & Volberg, 1996). This interest in gambling can partly be explained by the
enjoyment and thrill individuals experience when gambling (e.g.,
Dickerson & Adcock, 1987; Spanier, 1987). This enjoyment can lead
certain individuals to develop a serious interest for, and invest more
time in, gambling. Some people may even come to refer to gambling
as a passion. Vallerand and his colleagues (Vallerand & Blanchard,
1999; Vallerand, Blanchard, Koestner, & Gagné, 2001) recently developed a general motivational approach to passion highly relevant to the
domain of gambling.
According to Vallerand et al. (2001), passion is a strong inclination toward an activity that we like, find important, and in which we
invest time. Two types of passion are proposed: obsessive passion and
harmonious passion. Obsessive passion refers to an internal pressure
that forces individuals to perform an activity. People with an obsessive
passion experience an urge to do the activity that is difficult to resist.
This can create conflicts because individuals feel trapped between the
urge to partake in their passionate activity and their obligations in
other life contexts. As a result, they are likely to experience negative
consequences during and after the practice of their passionate activity.
For example, individuals for whom gambling is an obsessive passion
may feel guilty for spending too much time at the casino instead of
spending time with their family. Harmonious passion, on the other

hand, refers to a motivational tendency that leads individuals to
choose freely to engage in the activity. Instead of feeling pressured, as
is the case with obsessive passion, individuals with a harmonious passion feel in control of their activity and can decide when to engage in
it. The passionate activity is thus in harmony with activities or responsibilities in other life contexts. Harmonious passion is expected to result in positive consequences.
The type of passion that individuals develop depends on the way
the activity has been internalized into the self (Vallerand et al., 2001).
Obsessive passion is hypothesized to develop as a result of nonselfdetermined internalization (Deci & Ryan, 1991). Individuals with an
obsessive passion would have internalized their passionate activity
while they felt pressured to engage in it. For instance, they may have
developed an obsessive passion for gambling because they originally
felt coerced by their friends to participate in gambling games. It is
important to note that the pressure could also have been self-imposed
(see Ryan & Deci, 2000). On the other hand, harmonious passion is
hypothesized to develop as a result of self-determined internalization.
Individuals with a harmonious passion would have internalized their
passionate activity while they originally felt totally free to partake in
the activity or not.
Several factors are likely to be involved in the development of
passion. Personality variables are hypothesized to be one type of influence. In line with this perspective, Vallerand et al. (2001) showed that
global motivation (a type of motivation akin to a personality trait; Vallerand & Ratelle, in press) was associated with passion. More specifically, nonself-determined global motivation (i.e., a general motivational orientation to interact with the environment out of external or
internal pressures) was associated with obsessive passion, while selfdetermined global motivation (i.e., a general motivational orientation
to interact with the environment out of pleasure, satisfaction, or personal choice) was associated with harmonious passion. Specific personality traits have also been linked to different types of passion. In a
study conducted with undergraduate students, Blanchard, Heatherton, Koepsel, and Hull (2001) found that obsessive passion was positively related to neuroticism, but harmonious passion was positively
related to openness to experience.
External forces (e.g., encouragement, criticism, etc.) can also play
a role in the development of passion. Research conducted with chil-

<-----Page 3----->48

dren and their parents suggests that parents influence the development of obsessive passion in their children (Salvy, Mageau, Seidah,
Vallerand, & Bouffard, 2001). Salvy et al. found that this influence
results from parents’ wishes that their children develop a passion for
an activity, and that they engage in only one, rather than several, activities. With respect to gambling, external factors such as pressure from
friends and colleagues could lead an individual to develop a passion
for that activity. Major life events or life transitions may also play a role
in the development of passion. Individuals going through a difficult
time (e.g., divorce) might feel the urge to escape self-awareness (Baumeister, 1998) by investing time and energy into an activity like gambling, which may then become an obsessive passion. In contrast, other
situations may lead individuals to develop a harmonious passion. For
instance, with more time on their hands, recently retired individuals
might freely decide to invest more time and energy into an activity
that they find very interesting (Atchley, 1993). Although, research on
the determinants of passion are still in the early stages, empirical findings already provide support for the potential role of personality traits
and external forces in the development of passion.
Several studies have examined the consequences associated with
obsessive and harmonious passion in domains as varied as sport
(Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001; Rousseau, Dumais, & Vallerand, 2000;
Mageau, Demers, Vallerand, & Provencher, 2000), work (Houlfort, Vallerand, & Blanchard, 1999), theatre (Salvy, Vallerand, & Blanchard,
1999), internet use (Séguin-Lévesque, Laliberté, Pelletier, Blanchard,
& Vallerand, 2001), summer camps for children (Salvy et al., 2000),
and aging (Rousseau, Vallerand, LeMartret, & Clark, 1999). Taken
together, the results of these studies show that obsessive passion is
typically associated with negative consequences such as conflict in
interpersonal relationships (Séguin-Lévesque et al., 2001), depression
(Rousseau et al., 1999), and perceived stress (Blanchard & Vallerand,
2001), while harmonious passion is associated with positive consequences such as enhanced subjective well-being (Houlfort et al., 1999;
Rousseau et al., 1999; Salvy et al., 1999), better emotional control
(Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001), and increased meaning in life and
vitality (Rousseau et al., 1999). No study, however, has applied Vallerand et al.’s (2001) concept of passion to gambling. Doing so could
yield important information about the psychological processes, and

the consequences, associated with gambling. On the basis of previous
studies on passion, it could be argued that gambling involvement as
such might not necessarily lead to negative consequences. Rather, it
should only be the case if obsessive passion is at play. Gambling involvement originating from harmonious passion may even lead to
some positive outcomes. It is therefore important to examine the role
of different types of passion toward gambling.
In order to measure passion, Vallerand et al. (2001) developed
the Passion Scale. The Passion Scale is made up of two subscales (obsessive passion and harmonious passion) of seven items each. Depending on the needs of the study, two sets of instructions can be used. In
one set of instructions participants are asked to think of the activity
that is most important to them. The passionate activity can thus differ
from one participant to the next. In another set of instructions, participants are asked to think about a specific activity determined ahead of
time by the researchers. This last set of instructions is used when researchers are interested in examining passion toward a specific activity,
such as work (Houlfort et al., 1999) or basketball (Mageau et al.,
2000). All participants (regardless of the instructions they receive) are
then asked to indicate their degree of agreement with each of the 14
items of the Passion Scale referring to their passionate activity. An example of an item from the obsessive passion subscale is “I have a tough
time controlling my need to do this activity,” while a sample item from
the harmonious passion subscale is “This activity is in harmony with
the other activities in my life.”
Although the Passion Scale is a reliable and valid instrument, its
length and item content need to be adapted to reflect the specific
characteristics of the activity of gambling. Gambling differs from other
passionate activities examined in past research in at least two respects.
First, for some individuals the consequences associated with gambling
(e.g., severe financial losses, interpersonal problems, and criminal behavior) can be extremely detrimental (Ladouceur et al., 1994; Meyer
& Stadler, 1999). Thus, the items used to measure passion toward
sport or work for instance may not directly apply to gambling, and
therefore need to be adapted. Second, gambling takes place in locations where testing might be difficult to conduct (e.g., casinos). A
shorter instrument would be very useful in such circumstances. The
purpose of the present study was therefore to validate the Gambling

<-----Page 5----->50

Passion Scale (GPS), a French measure of passion toward gambling
based on Vallerand et al.’s (2001) Passion Scale.1 We hypothesized that
the GPS would be both reliable and valid among a population of casino gamblers. More specifically, we hypothesized that results from factor analyses (exploratory and confirmatory) of the GPS would yield a
two-factor structure and that both subscales would have satisfactory
reliability. We also hypothesized that the associations between the two
types of passion for gambling and several behavioral consequences related to gambling would lead to findings similar to those observed in
other contexts (e.g., Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001; Vallerand et al.,
2001). We expected obsessive passion to be associated with negative
behavioral consequences, but harmonious passion to be either unrelated or weakly related to such consequences.

STUDY 1
The purpose of the first study was threefold. The first purpose was
to examine the factor structure of the GPS through exploratory and
confirmatory factor analyses. The second purpose was to assess the
internal consistency of the two subscales (obsessive passion and harmonious passion). The final purpose was to assess the construct validity of
the GPS by conducting a Pearson correlation between the two subscales, as well as by conducting partial correlations between the two
subscales and behavioral outcomes related to gambling.
Method
Participants. The GPS was completed by 312 French-speaking
participants (134 females, and 177 males; gender information was
missing for one participant). The average age of the participants was
47.9 years and their average income fell between (CAN)$30,000 and
(CAN)$39,999.
Procedures. Participants were recruited in one of the main entrance halls of the Montreal Casino. The interviewers approached all
passersby. After identifying themselves as students from a local university, interviewers told casino gamblers that they were conducting a sur-

<-----Page 6----->FRANÇOIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL.

51

vey on gambling and asked them if they gambled at the casino at least
once a month. Passersby who said yes were then asked to fill out a
questionnaire on their general attitudes toward gambling. (It is not
possible to report how many passersby refused to fill out the questionnaire because interviewers did not record this information.) Passersby
who agreed to fill out the questionnaire were taken to a table located
behind dividers. There, they where given additional explanations
about the survey. They were told that there were no right or wrong
answers, that they should answer spontaneously and honestly, and that
their answers would remain confidential and anonymous. Participants
were offered a coffee or a juice while they filled out the questionnaire.
Upon completion of the questionnaire, participants were offered a lottery ticket for their participation. Participants who felt the need to talk
to someone about gambling-related issues were given phone numbers
to contact either the counselling services of the Montreal Casino or
Gamblers Anonymous.
Measures. The questionnaire included the GPS. Participants were
asked to think about their favorite gambling game and to indicate
their degree of agreement for each item of the GPS accordingly. The
GPS was adapted from Vallerand et al.’s (2001) Passion Scale. The
items in the GPS were adapted to refer to a gambling game or the act
of gambling. Also, four items were deleted to shorten the scale, leaving
five items to measure obsessive passion and five items to measure harmonious passion. An example of an item from the obsessive passion
subscale on the GPS is “I have a tough time controlling my need to
gamble at this game,” while a sample item from the harmonious passion subscale is “Gambling is in harmony with the other activities in my
life” (see Table 1 for the other items). Participants’ responses to each
item were scored using a seven-point Likert scale anchored by the end
point “Not agree at all” (1) and “Very strongly agree” (7). The questionnaire also comprised six behavioral measures related to gambling.
First, we measured the amount of money participants usually spent at
their favorite gambling game [“In general, in my favorite gambling
game I spend . . .”; 9-point scale anchored by the end point “Little
money” (1) and “A lot of money” (9)]. Second, we measured participants’ perceptions of themselves as gamblers [“In general, in my favorite gambling game I consider myself . . .”; 9-point scale anchored by

Third, we measured participants’ longevity of gambling at their favorite game [“I have been playing at my favorite gambling game . . .”;
9-point scale anchored by the end point “For very little time” (1) and
“For a very long time” (9)]. Fourth, we measured the number of gambling games at which participants played. Fifth, we also measured participants’ gambling frequency [“I play at my favorite gambling game.
. .”; 9-point scale anchored by the end point “Very rarely” (1) and

<-----Page 8----->FRANÇOIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL.

53

“Very often” (9)]. Finally, we measured participants’ perceptions of
gambling as being part of their self. This was done by adapting the
“Inclusion of Others into Self Scale” (see Aron, Aron, & Smollan,
1992; Blanchard, Perreault, & Vallerand, 1998). Participants were provided with Venn diagrams of two circles depicting the relation between
themselves and their favorite gambling game. One circle represented
the participant and the other circle represented the participant’s favorite gambling game. The first diagram showed the two circles side by
side (i.e., no overlap between the two circles). Going from left to right,
six more Venn diagrams were presented with the circles gradually overlapping, until the seventh Venn diagram depicted an almost complete
overlap of the two circles. Participants had to circle one of the seven
diagrams [7-point scale anchored by the end point “Me and the game
represent two distinct entities” (1) and “Me and the game represent
almost the same entity” (7)]. The questionnaire also comprised a short
version of the Social Desirability Scale (SDS; Crowne & Marlowe, 1960;
e.g., “When I make a mistake I am always ready to admit it”; 14 items,
alpha ⳱ .64). The SDS was assessed on a 7-point scale anchored by
the end points “Do not agree at all” (1) and “Agree completely” (7)
with the midpoint “Agree moderately” (4). The SDS was randomly included in some questionnaires in order to keep the questionnaire as
short as possible for most participants. In total, 164 participants filledout the SDS. Results from t-tests revealed no significant differences on
socio-demographic variables and behavioral measures of gambling between participants who filled out the SDS and participants who did
not. Finally, measures of socio-demographic information (i.e., sex, age,
schooling, and income) were included in all questionnaires.
Results and Discussion
First, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted in order to test
the hypothesized structure of the GPS, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the structure of the GPS. We randomly divided
the main sample into two subsamples (see Joiner et al., 1999 for a
similar procedure), leaving 162 participants for the exploratory factor
analysis and 150 participants for the confirmatory factor analysis. All
the other analyses were used with the total sample (n ⳱ 312), unless
indicated otherwise. Second, internal consistency of the subscales was
assessed using Cronbach alphas. Finally, in order to establish the con-

<-----Page 9----->54

struct validity of the GPS, we conducted a Pearson correlation between
the two subscales, as well as partial correlations between the two subscales (controlling for the other Passion subscale) and the six behavioral measures related to gambling described in the previous paragraph.
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). As a first step, we examined separately the univariate distributions of all variables and verified that
they were normally distributed (levels of skewness and kurtosis within
Ⳳ2). Then an EFA was conducted on the 10 items of the GPS, using a
maximum likelihood method of estimation with Oblimin rotation. Results showed that two factors could be extracted, explaining a total of
56.3% of the variance (see Table 1). Both factors were identified as
obsessive passion and harmonious passion, with eigenvalues of 4.32
and 2.17, respectively. Each subscale was composed of five items, and
all loadings were higher than .50. Finally, the correlation between both
factors was .33 (n ⳱ 162), indicating that although related (since both
factors represent passion toward gambling) they were relatively independent from each other.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). As a second step, a CFA using a
maximum likelihood method of estimation was performed with EQS
(Bentler, 1995) on the second half of the sample (n ⳱ 150). A confirmatory factor model that allowed free loadings on the items within
each of the two factors as postulated by the theory was tested. Factor
variances were fixed at unity and both factors were allowed to correlate
freely. The adequacy of fit for the model was based on the chi-square
statistic (Bentler, 1980), the comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990),
the normed fit index (NFI; Bentler & Bonett, 1980), and the nonnormed fit index (NNFI; Bentler, 1990).
In this model, two factors were postulated. These factors corresponded to the two subscales of the GPS and were made up of the 10
corresponding items. No cross-loadings were postulated. The chisquare statistic p value was non-significant, ␹2(34, n ⳱ 150) ⳱ 48.14,
p ⬎ .05, and all three fit indices were satisfactory (CFI ⳱ .97;
NFI ⳱ .92; NNFI ⳱ .97). Taken together, these results indicate that
the postulated model was acceptable. The model is presented in Figure 1.
Internal Consistency and Means. The internal consistency of the
two subscales was assessed using Cronbach alphas. As can be seen from

p ⬍ .01. Means on the GPS were also examined according to the gambling games reported by participants. Three games were clearly more
popular than the other games: slot machines (197 participants), blackjack (47 participants) and roulette (22 participants). The means on
the obsessive passion subscale for these three activities were 2.67, 3.00,
and 2.11, respectively. A oneway analysis of variance showed no significant difference among those scores. The means on the harmonious
passion subscale were 3.21 (slot machines), 3.83 (blackjack), and 3.55
(roulette). Results from a oneway analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect, F(2, 265) ⳱ 4.50, p ⬍ .05. Scheffé post hoc tests
revealed that the mean scores on harmonious passion for participants
whose favorite game was blackjack were significantly higher than the
mean scores for participants whose favorite game was slot machines,
t(263) ⳱ ⳮ2.90, p ⬍ .01. There were no significant differences between the mean scores for participants whose favorite game was roulette and the mean scores for participants whose favorite game was slot
machines.
Correlations Between the Two Subscales. In line with past research
(e.g., Houlfort et al., 1999; Vallerand et al., 2001), we expected obsessive and harmonious passion to be only moderately correlated. Results
showed that the Pearson correlation between obsessive and harmonious passion was .28 (n ⳱ 312), thus underscoring that both subscales are relatively independent from each other.
Partial Correlations. First, partial correlations were conducted between the GPS subscales and socio-demographic variables (controlling
for the other Passion subscale). As can be seen from Table 3, the only
significant partial correlation occurred between sex and harmonious
passion, showing that men tended to report more harmonious passion
toward gambling than women (partial r ⳱ .17, p ⬍ .01). Therefore,
both types of passion do not seem to vary according to the socio-demographic variables measured in this study, with the exception of sex. It
should also be noted that there was no significant association between
obsessive or harmonious passion and social desirability.
We then conducted partial correlations (again controlling for the
other Passion subscale) between the GPS subscales and the six measures of gambling behaviors (see Table 4). With respect to obsessive

passion, there was a significant positive association with the amount of
money gambled in general (partial r ⳱ .51, p ⬍ .001), being a heavy
gambler (partial r ⳱ .49, p ⬍ .001), longevity of gambling (partial
r ⳱ .19, p ⬍ .001), and the number of gambling games involved in
(partial r ⳱ .14, p ⬍ .05). These partial correlations indicate that participants who reported higher levels of obsessive passion toward gambling also reported (1) gambling more money in general, (2) perceiving themselves as being heavier gamblers, (3) having gambled for a
longer period of time, and (4) gambling at more games. Harmonious
passion was not significantly associated with any of those measures.
Obsessive passion and harmonious passion were both positively associated with game frequency (partial r ⳱ .31, p ⬍ .001 and partial
r ⳱ .17, p ⬍ .01 for obsessive and harmonious passion, respectively)
and game as part of the self (partial r ⳱ .46, p ⬍ .001 and partial
r ⳱ .15, p ⬍ .01 for obsessive and harmonious passion, respectively).
In both instances, however, the partial correlations were stronger for

obsessive passion than for harmonious passion. Thus, participants who
reported higher levels of obsessive passion toward gambling reported
gambling more frequently and perceived the game as being more part
of their selves. Taken together, the results from partial correlations
indicate that obsessive passion is associated with several potentially
negative outcomes. Although our results do not allow us to talk about
causality, they indicate that obsessive passion may contribute to remaining a heavy gambler and betting large sums of money at more
games. Harmonious passion, on the other hand, may contribute to a
healthier style of engagement in gambling.
In summary, the results from Study 1 underscore several important findings. First, results from both an EFA and a CFA support the
two-factor structure of the GPS. Second, obsessive and harmonious
passion are relatively independent from each other. Third, the internal
consistency values of the obsessive passion subscale and the harmonious passion subscale are satisfactory. Fourth, social desirability and
socio-demographic variables, with the exception of sex, are not related
to the two types of passion. Finally, obsessive passion was more strongly
associated with negative behaviors related to gambling than harmonious passion, thus providing support for the construct validity of the
GPS.
STUDY 2
In order to demonstrate that the GPS is a reliable measure of
individuals’ passion toward gambling, it should be relatively stable
across time. The purpose of the second study was therefore to evaluate
the temporal stability of the GPS using test-retest correlations. The
internal consistency of the subscales was also reassessed.
Method
Participants. Twenty-eight French-speaking individuals (11 females and 17 males) took part in this study. The average age of the
participants was 44.8 years and their average income fell between
(CAN)$30,000 and (CAN)$39,999.
Procedures. Participants were first contacted at the Montreal Casino, where they filled out a questionnaire (the procedure used was

the same as the one described in Study 1). Upon completion of the
questionnaire, participants were asked if they would accept to complete a second questionnaire a few weeks later. They were informed
that the questionnaire would be mailed to them and that they would
also receive a pre-addressed and pre-stamped envelope to return their
questionnaire after completing it. They were also reminded that their
responses would remain confidential. Participants who agreed to participate gave their address and their name or initials. Approximately
four weeks later, participants were mailed a second questionnaire comprising the GPS and the same socio-demographic information used in
the first study. A lottery ticket was also included in the package as a
token of our appreciation. Of all the participants who agreed to take

part in the study, 28 filled out and returned their questionnaire. Unfortunately, the exact number of participants who agreed to take part
in Study 2 is not available.
Internal Consistency and Means. The internal consistency of the
two subscales was assessed using Cronbach alphas. As can be seen from
Table 2, values were satisfactory with alphas ranging from .83 to .96.
The means for pretest for obsessive passion were 2.33 and 2.17, for
females and males, respectively, t(26) ⳱ 0.28, n.s. The means for pretest for harmonious passion were 2.04 and 3.44, for females and males,
respectively, t(26) ⳱ ⳮ3.02, p ⬍ .01. The means for posttest for obsessive passion were 2.29 and 1.77, for females and males, respectively,
t(26) ⳱ 1.09, n.s. The means for posttest for harmonious passion were
2.42 and 3.37, for females and males, respectively, t(26) ⳱ ⳮ1.89, n.s.
Results and Discussion
First, results showed that the test-retest correlations for the obsessive (r ⳱ .83, p ⬍ .001) and harmonious (r ⳱ .82, p ⬍ .001) passion
subscales were high and significant, thus supporting the temporal stability of the GPS (see Table 2). Second, as indicated in the previous
paragraph, alpha values for the pretest (␣ ⳱ .96 and ␣ ⳱ .83 for the
obsessive and harmonious subscales, respectively) and the posttest
(␣ ⳱ .89 and ␣ ⳱ .84 for the obsessive and harmonious subscales, respectively) were also satisfactory. Taken together, these results provide
further support for the internal consistency of the obsessive and harmonious subscales. The results of Study 2 thus show that the GPS is a
reliable instrument to measure casino gamblers’ passion toward gambling.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
The purpose of the two studies reported in this article was to validate the Gambling Passion Scale (GPS), a scale that measures individuals’ passion toward gambling. The present results reveal that the GPS
has adequate levels of reliability and validity. With respect to the reliability of the scale, results from the two studies showed that both
subscales have adequate levels of internal consistency and display good

<-----Page 17----->62

JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES

levels of temporal stability over a four-week period. With respect to the
validity of the GPS, results from an EFA and a CFA supported the
hypothesized two-factor structure of the GPS, thereby providing factorial validity to the scale. Moreover, partial correlations showed that obsessive passion is associated with negative behavioral measures related
to gambling while harmonious passion is generally not associated with
those measures. These results underscore the importance of examining both obsessive and harmonious passion toward gambling as these
two types of passion may lead to different consequences.
One advantage of the GPS is its short length. With only 10 items,
the GPS can be administered rapidly and can be used in locations
generally less conducive to testing (e.g., casinos). For instance, the
GPS could be administered to individuals while they are actually gambling. This could lead to interesting studies.
Although the present results are very encouraging, further studies
will be needed to examine the psychometric properties of the GPS
more thoroughly. First, we will need to determine if the GPS can also
be used with non-casino gamblers, such as individuals who buy lottery
tickets or play at video lottery terminals (VLT). Lotteries and VLTs are
easily accessible and very popular. Indeed, they accounted for 77% of
Loto-Québec’s net profits for the fiscal year of 1998–1999 (LotoQuébec, 1999). Having an instrument to measure passion toward several casino and non-casino gambling activities would further our
knowledge of gambling and its consequences. Second, the GPS should
be translated and validated in English. Doing so would yield at least
two benefits. First, it would make the scale available to a greater number of researchers. Second, it would then be possible to try to replicate
the present results in other countries and cultures.
The validation of the GPS shows that gambling is an activity that
can be subjected to the psychological processes of passion. This finding opens up several avenues of research on gambling. First, Vallerand
et al. (2001) proposed that obsessive passion generally leads to negative consequences while harmonious passion generally leads to positive
consequences. Results from Study 1 showed that obsessive passion toward gambling is associated with negative behavioral consequences
such as gambling large sums of money, being a heavy gambler, having
gambled for a longer period of time, and gambling at more games.
On the basis of past studies (e.g., Blanchard & Vallerand, 2001;
Houlfort et al., 1999; Salvy et al., 1999; Rousseau et al., 1999; Vallerand

<-----Page 18----->FRANÇOIS L. ROUSSEAU ET AL.

63

et al., 2001), we would expect this pattern to occur for affective and
cognitive consequences as well. For instance, we would expect obsessive passion toward gambling to be associated with negative affective
consequences such as anxiety and guilt, while harmonious passion
should be associated with positive affective consequences such as fun
and enjoyment. Future studies should therefore examine the behavioral, affective, and cognitive consequences associated with obsessive
and harmonious passion toward gambling. A second avenue of research concerns the possibility that different patterns of fluctuations in
gamblers’ behaviors, affects, and cognitions may emerge according to
the types of passion reported by gamblers. For instance, individuals for
whom gambling is an obsessive passion might experience great pleasure while gambling, only to experience intense guilt later on (following a gambling episode) upon realizing that their gambling led them
to spend large sums of money or to miss an important meeting. On
the other hand, individuals for whom gambling is a harmonious passion might report experiencing more positive consequences regularly.
Addressing this issue would lead to a better understanding of the consequences of gambling, not only in the context of gambling, but also
with respect to outcomes it can produce in other life contexts such as
work and family relationships.
From an applied perspective, the GPS should help researchers
gain a better understanding of pathological gambling, a disorder of
impulse control with important social consequences (American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV, 1994; Walker, 1992). Vallerand et al. (2001) see people with an
obsessive passion as individuals who are controlled by, and cannot resist the urge to engage in, their favorite activity. Obsessive passion may
represent the psychological mechanism responsible for the lack of control observed in pathological gambling. In line with this hypothesis,
results from Study 1 showed that obsessive passion was associated with
potential indicators of pathological gambling (e.g., higher amount of
money generally spent on gambling, being a heavier gambler, longevity of gambling). Equally important is the fact that the GPS, contrary
to other standard measures of pathological gambling (South Oaks
Gambling Screen, Lesieur & Blume, 1987), makes the distinction between two types of gamblers who can both be as passionate for gambling, but who experience very different consequences as the result of
their passion. The distinction between obsessive and harmonious pas-

<-----Page 19----->64

sion should allow researchers to discriminate between passionate gamblers who suffer from pathological gambling (obsessive passion), and
passionate gamblers who are relatively free from such problems (harmonious passion). In other words, the GPS taps into a dimension not
available through other measures of problem gambling, according to
which individuals who are very involved in gambling automatically experience negative consequences. Moreover, future research on passion
might be able to determine if individuals can switch from one type of
passion to the other, and if so, under what conditions. If obsessive
passion for gambling is indeed related to pathological gambling, a better understanding of the fluctuations between harmonious and obsessive passion could lead researchers and clinicians using the GPS to
develop better prevention programs against pathological gambling by
identifying individuals who are at risk.
In summary, although the GPS is a new instrument that needs
further testing, the present results underscore the quality of its psychometric properties. Those characteristics, combined with the flexibility
offered by the short length of the scale, and the information not obtainable through the use of other standard measures of gambling,
should make the GPS a useful tool in future research on gambling.
