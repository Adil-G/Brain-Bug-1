Strategic Alliance Management

This article argues that the success of international strategic alliances requires attention not only to the hard
side of alliance management (e.g., financial issues and other operational issues) but, also, to the soft side.
The soft side refers to the development and management of relationship capital in the alliance. Relationship
capital consists of the socio-psychological aspects of the alliance that are positive and beneficial to the
alliance. Two important areas of relationship capital are mutual trust and commitment. Based on our
findings from two major studies of Japanese strategic alliances, we develop a dynamic model of trust and
commitment based on mutual adjustments of alliance partners. We also show how the dynamics of trust and
commitment affect the performance of international strategic alliances with the Japanese. The article
concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications of our findings and the dynamic model.

sitions, physical plants, and production
resource allocation. They formulate detailed schedules for the sharing of rewards
and outputs of the alliance. In other
words, managers in the partner firms
work diligently and conscientiously on
the hard functional (e.g., the legal, financial, operational) side of strategic alliance
management and planning. However, we
suggest that no amount of financial investment and no amount of attention to
the hard side of alliance management are
worth the risk without corresponding attention to the soft side.
In strategic alliances, the soft side of
management refers to the development
and management of relationship capital

the investment of financial capital, partner firms in both domestic and international strategic alliances must invest in
relationship capital. We consider relationship capital in the alliance as the
quality of the relationship that exists
between social actors (Coleman, 1990).
Relationship capital consists of the
socio-psychological aspects of the alliance, more specifically those sociopsychological aspects that are positive
and beneficial in the alliance. It involves the pattern of interaction between partner firms that facilitates and
allows for the effective functioning of
the alliance on a day-to-day basis. It is
through relationship capital that the alliance is actually enacted and implemented. Relationship capital involves
having alliance partners attend to and
invest in time and effort toward building positive feelings and interaction patterns in the alliance relationship. Although often ignored completely or
subordinated as secondary to financial
considerations, the alliance cannot optimize performance without adequate relationship capital. After the alliance
deal is made, parent companies must
grant local alliance managers the autonomy, resources, and time to build a relationship beyond the arm’s length contract.
Although not the only aspects of relationship capital, most researchers consider trust and commitment as the major
forms (Burt, 1997; Hosmer, 1995;
Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer
1998). Other types of relationship capital include, for example, norms of reciprocity, information exchange, and cultural sensitivity. However, trust and
224 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

commitment are the essential threads in
the social fabric of any alliance relationship. Managers from both failed and
successful strategic alliances recognize
the importance of building mutual trust
and commitment among partners. No
matter how mutually beneficial and logical the venture may seem at its start,
without trust and commitment, the alliance will fail entirely or, at the very
least, it will fail to reach its strategic
potential. Even in situations where the
economic structure of a relationship
may seem paramount, without the social glue of trust and commitment, alliances will not deliver their potential
strategic or economic payoff (Madhok,
1995). Given the increased complexities of managing alliances that span national cultures, trust and commitment
may be even more important in international strategic alliances.
Over the past several years, we have
studied how Japanese firms and their
partners develop commitment and trust
in strategic alliances. The alliances we
examined came in a variety of forms
including both equity joint ventures and
nonequity cooperative agreements. All
of the alliances involved Japanese companies and companies from other countries. In this article, we propose a dynamic model of trust and commitment
and their relationships to strategic alliance performance. We derive this
model from the implications of our previous studies and additional results presented below. We show how trust and
commitment affect alliances with the
Japanese and, in some cases, how the
Japanese differ from their partners. We
conclude with specific managerial implications.

<-----Page 2----->COMMITMENT AND TRUST IN
INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
Definitions
Trust and commitment are distinct
concepts even though they are often
closely related in practice and are mutually reinforcing in alliances. As such,
in this section, we provide formal definitions of each concept based on current
research and theory.
Trust, the first major component of
relationship capital, is based in beliefs
about how an alliance partner will behave in the relationship. Can our alliance partner be trusted? Are they reliable? Would they do something to harm
us? Will they take care of the relationship and us? While these questions capture the general essence of trust, most
experts believe that trust in alliances is
rooted in two distinct bases, one rational and the other emotional (Kramer,
1999; Moorman, Deshpande, & Zaltman, 1993). We briefly describe the two
components of trust below.
Credibility trust, the rational component of trust, is the confidence that the
partner has the intent and ability to meet
their obligations and make their promised contributions to the alliance (Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, & Takenouchi,
1996). It is the practical side of trust. It
concerns beliefs about whether or not a
partner can really deliver what they
promise. Can the partner be relied upon
in alliance activities and operations?
Does the partner have the expertise and
resources they say that they have? Beyond this, lie questions about whether
or not the partner will use and apply that

expertise and those resources in alliance
activities and operation.
Benevolent trust is the belief that an
alliance partner will behave with goodwill toward the alliance and the partner
(Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, & Takenouchi, 1996). Benevolence is the subjective or emotional side of trust. It has
more to do with one’s beliefs regarding
a partner’s caring about the relationship. Can the partner be trusted not to
harm the alliance? Can the partner be
trusted to protect and preserve the alliance even when conditions change?
Commitment is the second major
component of social capital. In general,
commitment in an international strategic alliance concerns a partner’s intention to continue in a relationship. Does
the firm intend to stay in the relationship and put forth effort for the relationship to succeed? As with trust, commitment in a strategic alliance stems from
two bases. One form of commitment,
referred to as instrumental, can be
thought of as rational, the other as attitudinal (Becker, 1960; Mowday, Porter,
& Steers, 1982).
As in all business dealings, commitment to the strategic alliance relationship must have an instrumental base.
That is, businesses do not enter alliances to make friends; they enter alliances to gain some form of economic
reward. Evaluations, expectations, and
concerns about the future potential for
gaining rewards in and from an alliance
relationship provide drive instrumental
commitment. For a relationship to continue, there must be a positive benefit/
cost analysis for the partners. Managers
must see a potential for returns and/or a
need to avoid switching costs. This is

Success Through Commitment and Trust: The Soft Side of Strategic Alliance Management

225

<-----Page 3----->the rational and economic side of commitment. It is called calculative commitment.
Commitment also has an emotional
or affective component. In this regard,
commitment in an international strategic alliance means that partners, in a
sense, internalize the alliance relationship. The alliance assumes a position of
status and importance; the partners are
willing to nurture and care for it. There
is a fairly deep psychological identification with the relationship and a pride
of association with the partner and with
the alliances. This type of commitment
is called attitudinal commitment. It
means giving extra effort to make the
venture work and a willingness to go
beyond mere contractual obligations.
Committed partners dedicate resources
and effort and face risks to make the
venture work.

WHY ARE TRUST
IMPORTANT?

AND

COMMITMENT

We believe that mutual trust and
commitment are central for international strategic alliances for several reasons. First, no contract or other agreement, no matter how complete or
detailed, can account for every issue or
every contingency that might arise. Formal contracts can never anticipate and
identify all the events and changes that
occur over the lifetime of the strategic
alliance. Likewise, it is not feasible that
partner companies rewrite an agreement
every time a new issue or situation
arises. Necessarily, much of what happens between partners in alliances develops informally in the alliance rela226 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

tionship. Ultimately, especially in
evolving or long-term alliances, managers must default to trust and commitment, the social fabric of the relationship, to fill the gaps in the formal
agreement and to keep the relationship
running smoothly.
Second, the alliance of two or more
companies creates a strong potential for
dysfunctional conflict and mistrust.
Companies often differ in strategic
goals and objectives for the alliance;
they differ in the extent and type of
experience with alliances. Companies
differ in organizational cultures and
management philosophies; they differ
in their routine policies and procedures.
When the partners are from different
national cultures, these differences are
magnified and commonly generate misunderstandings. Even for the most financially rational relationship, without
a continuous investment in and building
of commitment and trust, differences in
partner companies in conjunction with
cultural differences can greatly inhibit
the alliance’s durability and its success.
Without a sense of mutual commitment
to each other, partners often fail to work
out the inevitable problems of crossnational alliances. Instead they retreat
to their own companies or cultures leaving issues unresolved and often feeling
the venture is not worth the effort. The
result is an alliance with less than optimal performance and perhaps eventual
dissolution.
However, as in marriages between
individuals (Quinn & Odell, 1998; Kotler, 1989; McDonald, 1981), if partners
involved in an alliance demonstrate mutual commitment, the venture will develop based on the principle of fair ex-

<-----Page 4----->change (Lane & Beamish, 1990). Fair
exchange means that all partners believe that they receive benefits from the
relationship that equal their contributions. If partners go beyond fair exchange and develop an attitudinal commitment to the relationship, the
relationship can often sustain periods of
unequal exchange. Strong norms of reciprocity develop in the relationship
where there is a sense of give and take
between the alliance partners. Mutual
commitment and the resulting norms of
reciprocity hold the relationship together. The partners believe that each
company will eventually receive its
due. As Lane and Beamish (1990: 100)
point out, “A successful relationship requires constant attention and nourishing. As one executive explained, ‘good
local partners have to be cherished and
taken care of.’”
Again similar to interpersonal relationships (Quinn & Odell, 1998), mutual trust is important because successful cooperation requires alliance
participants to contribute quality inputs
into the alliance organization. When
partners do not trust each other, they
hold back information or take unfair
advantage of each other if given the
opportunity. If this happens, the alliance
seldom produces all the mutual benefits
possible from cooperation. Unreliability, unfairness, and opportunistic behavior by partners set the alliance on a path
not only of suboptimization, but also
toward dissolution (Zand, 1972).
An additional reason that trust and
commitment are important in strategic
alliances involves learning, often cited
as one of the major benefits and motivations for strategic alliances. Some al-

liances are formed for technology transfer and exchange, or for the joint
development of technology. If partners
do not trust each other and are not committed to the alliance, technology transfer is greatly inhibited. The exchange of
information and scientific knowledge
necessary in the development of new
technologies may never take place.
Other more nebulous forms of knowhow referred to as “tacit knowledge”
exist in organizations. Tacit knowledge
includes skills, capabilities, and ways of
doing things that are parts of the organization’s culture. Tacit knowledge is
not written down and people often are
unaware of its exact nature. Thus, because tacit knowledge is deeply imbedded in an organization, it is difficult to
share outside of the context of a close
social relationship. Consequently, for
two organizations to share willing sensitive information and knowledge imbedded in the organization, they must
work closely. Without trust and commitment this is often not possible.
Are trust and commitment more important for strategic alliances with Japanese firms? We suspect so. For the
Japanese, the affective and social components of any business relationship are
extremely important. For the relationship to work smoothly, it must deemphasize formal contracts and build
on personal relationship (Peterson &
Shimada, 1978). That is, consistent with
Japanese business practices, trust and
commitment are components of relationships that are necessary for both
short term and long term success. The
formally negotiated relationship is only
the starting point. The real relationship
can only proceed when one is ade-

227

<-----Page 5----->quately comfortable with the partner.
This comfort is based on beliefs regarding the partner’s good will and dedication to the relationship.
In fact, the emotional sides of trust
and commitment, attitudinal commitment and benevolent trust, can serve as
flexible substitutes for formal contracts
for the Japanese. The Japanese accept
and expect that circumstances change.
They resist committing absolutely to
specific conditions of the relationship.
They accept, at any one time, that there
will be imbalances in the relationship.
Such imbalance can be tolerated only
when each side commits to the relationship and trusts that their partner will
eventually reciprocate (Madhok, 1995).
What happens when mutual trust is
low? Consider the example of Toshiba,
IBM, and Siemens AG (Browning
1994). Although traditional competitors, these firms united in an R&D joint
venture to produce the next generation
of computer chips. Over 200 scientists
from these culturally different companies and countries work in the IBM
research facility in New York. In theory, the cultural diversity and varied
backgrounds were supposed to foster
creativity and dramatic advances.
Unfortunately, not all went smoothly.
Initially, the Japanese found it difficult
to work in small isolated offices. The
closed cubicles were totally different
from their accustomed open office
spaces. The Germans were horrified
that Japanese slept in meetings when a
topic did not concern them. The IBMers
complained that the Germans planned
too much and were slowing things
down. Difficulties with communication
in English, lack of sufficient cross228 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

cultural training, and differences in
management styles also plagued the
venture. The result was a lack of trust, a
withdrawal of the Japanese, Germans,
and Americans into their own teams
and, perhaps more important, the belief
that the other companies’ scientists and
engineers held back information and
didn’t share ideas.
In the above example, the investments in social capital were not sufficient. Trust and commitment did not
build so that cultural differences could
be bridged and communication problems could be solved. The social fabric
of the alliance relationship was too
weak to sustain the pressure and hold
together, let alone build the kind of context in which such widely diverse constituents could develop productive interactions and generate a productive
outcome for anyone involved.
To understand why commitment and
trust develop in some alliances but not
others, a team of U.S. and Japanese
researchers conducted two major studies of international strategic alliances
involving Japanese companies and
companies from other nations. The next
section describes these studies in more
detail.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
PROCEDURES

AND

This article reports on the results of
two field research studies. One study
involved Japanese equity joint ventures
with partners from 11 other countries
where the language of business is English. The other study involved nonequity Japanese strategic alliances with

<-----Page 6----->U.S. companies. Data were gathered by
questionnaires sent, in Japanese, to the
top Japanese manager in each alliance
and, in English, to the top foreign manager in each alliance. Japanese participation in the study was secured by directly through personal contacts with
the research team. More extensive detail on the research methods, procedures, and questionnaire items has been
reported previously in more technical
papers (Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, &
Bronson, 2000; Cullen, Johnson, & Sakano, 1995; Johnson, Cullen, Sakano, &
Takenouchi, 1996).
The joint venture study looked at Japanese alliances located outside of Japan.
It included information from 79 Japanese partners and 73 local partners. The
major research question of this study
focused on how commitment was related to the joint venture’s performance
and the systems of control used in the
joint venture organization. We refer below to this study as the “IJV study.”
The nonequity strategic alliance
study looked at Japanese alliances
based in Japan. For this study, we gathered information from both Japanese
and U.S. partners in 98 alliances. The
major objective of this study was to
discover: the interrelationships among
forms of commitment and trust, the effects of cultural sensitivity on trust and
commitment, how partners build reciprocal trust, and how trust and commitment affect alliance performance. We
measured performance by asking alliance partners how well they achieved
their goals in 19 areas including, for
example, profits, penetration of new
markets, spreading risks, gaining access
to distribution channels, and pooling

complementary resources. We refer to
this study below as the “ICA study”
because it included international cooperative alliances that were not equity
based.
In this article, we focus on the managerial implications of our findings. In
addition to the empirical findings from
our surveys, we base the discussion below on interactions with IJV managers
during the studies and on closely related
work by other researchers. We also report on some information dealing with
performance not previously published
in more technical papers.
Table 1 shows a matrix of correlations from the ICA study that summarizes the relationships among the key
variables discussed below. We report
these data only for the ICA study because the IJV study did not include a
measure of trust and had a less sophisticated measure of performance. The relationships found among the facets of
trust, commitment, and goal achievement were the highest in our study.
They far exceeded other relationships
among variables measured similarly
suggesting that the correlations are not
due entirely to common methods.

HOW DO ALLIANCES BUILD TRUST
COMMITMENT?

AND

The development of trust and commitment in strategic alliances involves a
complex interplay between the dimensions of trust and the dimensions of
commitment within the individual alliance partner firm and across the alliance
dyad. In attempting to understand the
development of trust and commitment,

it is useful to consider the perspective of
the individual partner firm separately
from the interactions between firms in
the alliance relationship.
From the perspective of the individual partner firm, trust provides a foundation for commitment. The trust dimensions, benevolence and credibility,
are highly correlated and develop in
parallel. Firm managers develop beliefs
about their partner’s reliability and delivery on expectations in alliance activities, the credibility side of trust. Simultaneously, they develop beliefs that the
partner firm will act with good intentions and will not harm them, the benevolence side of trust. From the individual firm’s perspective, once
established, the trust dimensions appear
to contribute significantly to the development of commitment. Particularly,
once in place, credibility and benevolence lead to the instrumental dimen230 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

sion of commitment, that is, calculative
commitment. Attitudinal commitment,
the more emotional side, is the more
evolved form of commitment and may
take longer to develop. In addition,
whereas attitudinal commitment develops out of both dimensions of trust, it
appears to be rooted more deeply in the
emotional component of trust relative to
the rational component. Thus for the
alliance firm, trust — both credibility
and benevolence — of the partner builds
and leads the firm to commitment toward the alliance, first in the more rational or instrumental form and then
likely later at the deeper attitudinal
level.
The picture of trust and commitment
becomes more complex and dynamic
when viewed in terms of interactions
and responses of partners to each other
in the relationship, that is, from the dyadic perspective rather than the individ-

<-----Page 8----->ual firm’s perspective. In this case, the
issues involve mutual trust and mutual
commitment. As in all business interactions, the building of trust and commitment depends on the partners’ signaling
to each other and the interpretation and
response to this signaling in the relationship (Butler, 1991; 1995).
Most experts who study business negotiations believe that trust in relationships, such as those between alliance
partners, builds in through a feedback
pattern called a “trust cycle” (Butler,
1995; Zand, 1972). Just as individual
people in personal relationships, partners in strategic alliances often feel vulnerable in the initial stages of the relationship (Neale & Bazerman, 1992).
Firms often begin a relationship suspicious of each other’s motives. This
early vulnerability and suspicion makes
partners tentative in their involvement
in the relationship and reluctant to reveal true motives, business “knowhow,” or technology. For example, typical fears and questions include the
following: Do they want to steal our
technology? Are they trying to take us
over? Are we creating a new competitor? Are we giving away too much proprietary knowledge? Will they or can
they provide what we agreed on? If this
reluctance is apparent in the firm’s behavior and interactions with the partner
firm, it can be interpreted, perhaps
rightly so, as distrust. In turn, the partner firm will reciprocate with distrust in
their feelings and behaviors. Obviously,
such a pattern in the signaling between
partners makes trust difficult. In fact,
such early signaling may set a cycle of
distrust into motion in the relationship.

Conversely, by their behaviors and
interactions in the relationship, partners
in the alliance can signal trust of each
other, thereby setting in motion a positive cycle. Examples include delivering
more than expected in the exchange,
concessions in negotiations, forbearance in the wielding of power even if
justified, accommodation and flexibility
when the partner faces organizational
crises. In addition, strong information
sharing can signal trust and trustworthiness in alliance relationships. In related
research, interviews with managers
found that trust signaling symbols can
involve behaviors suggestive of openness and receptivity in communication
patterns, fairness and discretion in interactions (Butler 1991). Gradually, as
each side deals repeatedly with their
partner, suspicion declines and trust
grows reciprocally (Johnson et al.,
1996; Ring & Van de Ven, 1992). In
addition, based on our discussions with
managers and the high correlations between trust measures we believe that
forms of trust develop almost simultaneously.
Similar cycles seem to exist for commitment. Through behaviors and interactions firms signal commitment. In response, partners commit to each other
and to their alliance. However, differing
from the patterns of trust cycles, we
suspect that, in commitment cycles, the
rational component may build first.
Only later is this followed by the deeper
emotional component of commitment.
Suggesting this lag are the lower correlations between calculative and affective commitment (0.57 for the Japanese;
0.6 for the U.S.) than for the relation-

231

<-----Page 9----->Figure 1.
The Trust/Commitment Cycle

ships between the two forms of trust
(0.8 for Japanese; 0.86 for the U.S.).
In the alliance, a firm signals calculative commitment and the partner
likely reciprocates. Calculative commitment does not develop simultaneously
or in parallel with attitudinal commitment. Instead it seems to develop independently, perhaps because of mutual
trust or other positive factors in the relationship. Some evidence suggests that
the presence of too much of the calculative aspects of commitment or a dominance of calculative commitment without the attitudinal component may
actually be detrimental in the relationship (Kumar, Hibbard, & Stern 1994).
If a firm believes that its alliance partner
stays in the alliance only for economic
payoffs or because no other alliance has
greater payoffs, the development of the
relationship may be inhibited and the
positive benefits limited.
Figs. 1 and 2 summarize the impli232 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

cations of our findings for the relationships among forms of commitment and trust over time in strategic
alliances with the Japanese. We extrapolated processes from our crosssectional survey research based on our
discussions with managers and the dynamic processes generally observed in
negotiation behaviors (Butler, 1995;
Zand, 1972).
Fig. 1 shows that, as an anchor in the
business relationship, credibility trust
starts the trust/commitment cycle. That
is, being reliable, delivering what is
promised at the agreed upon quantity,
quality, and date builds a foundation.
This component of trust is followed
very closely by the development of benevolent trust. Perhaps they even develop simultaneously. Commitment
then follows. The implication is that the
more subjective investments in relationship capital, trust of partner and a commitment to the well being of the rela-

<-----Page 10----->Figure 2
The Reciprocity of Trust and Commitment

tionship, must begin with the
practicalities of the business relationship. This, however, does not discount
the importance of attitudinal commitment to the eventual success of the strategic alliance.
An additional implication from our
studies, illustrated in Fig. 2, is that
one partner’s trust and commitment
breeds trust and commitment in the
other partner. Note the strong crossdyad correlations in trust and commit-

ment for the Japanese and their U.S.
partners. Cross-dyad correlations
were 0.76 for credibility trust, 0.83 for
benevolent trust, 0.56 for calculative
commitment, and 0.68 for affective
commitment. Even with other variables controlled, we found that the
U.S. partner’s trust of its Japanese
partner accounted for over 55% of the
variance of the Japanese trust of the
U.S. firms (Johnson, Cullen, Sakano,
& Takenouchi, 1996: 995). Thus, our

Success Through Commitment and Trust: The Soft Side of Strategic Alliance Management

233

<-----Page 11----->data suggest that, whereas both partners undergo the processes shown in
Fig. 1, there is also reciprocity in the
relationship supporting the trust and
commitment cycles, that is, the development of mutual trust and commitment. Trust begets trust. Commitment
begets commitment. And trust begets
commitment.
When one partner trusts another
partner, they engage in trust-signaling
behaviors. Such signals include, for
example, meeting obligations and expectations, performing relevant tasks
competently and reliably, sharing information, consistently delivering expertise and resources, and generally
nurturing the relationship. Trustsignaling behaviors in turn motivate
the alliance partner to feel and expect
trust. The partner firm is then more
likely to reciprocate with similar behaviors, which signals trust back to
the other company. This feedback pattern of behaviors is likely reinforced
by alliance managers’ verbal statements of their confidence in partners.
Similarly, when a partner is committed to the relationship, they signal
their commitment with extra effort
and work for the alliance. For example, Japanese managers noted that
they believed that U.S. managers who
worked (as they do) until sundown
showed a commitment to the alliance.
Behaviors such as these in turn encourage the partner to do the same. In
essence, our findings suggest that,
when a firm trusts its partner or is
committed to the relationship, trust
and commitment become manifest in
behaviors that communicate these val234 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

ues to partners and encourage the
partners to reciprocate similarly.

ALLIANCE PERFORMANCE,
COMMITMENT, AND TRUST
Fig. 3 illustrates the implications of
our findings regarding how performance relates to commitment and trust.
Again, note the strong correlations of
meeting objectives with the dimensions
of trust and commitment found in our
ICA study (Table 1).
Performance in strategic alliances includes a range of possible outcomes
(Anderson, 1990). Learning a new market, gaining a new technology, and
learning new business practices are examples other than traditional financial
dimensions of performance. Our findings suggest that performances of all
types interplay with commitment and
trust. The data shown in Table 1 illustrate the high correlations of meeting all
types of alliance objectives and the facets of trust and commitment. Similarly,
our IJV study (Cullen, Johnson, & Sakano, 1995) showed a positive relationship between commitment and satisfaction with performance. Our findings and
theoretical reasoning on the bases of
commitment and its effects suggest that,
on one hand, higher levels of mutual
trust and commitment lead to better performing alliances in terms of both financial and nonfinancial aspects. On the
other hand, higher levels of performance result in more mutual commitment and trust.
The prevailing logic of why trust and
commitment affect the performance of
strategic alliances focuses on efficiency

<-----Page 12----->Figure 3
Trust and Commitment and Performance

and long term benefits. When two or
more firms combine their assets for strategic reasons (e.g., complementary
skills, economies of scale), then they
must build an alliance organization to
manage these combined assets. The
costs of building the necessary control
mechanisms to safeguard critical assets
and resources (e.g., technical knowledge) can be prohibitive if one does not
trust one’s partner (Parke, 1993). Surveillance frameworks and mechanisms
put in place to ensure partner performance and compliance, managerial
time and resources dedicated to surveillance, bureaucratic paper work and reports to monitor processes, and legal
fees to renegotiate contacts can often
eat away at potential alliance profits.
Conversely, when mutual trust and
commitment are high, none of these is
necessary, thus reducing the costs of
monitoring. In addition, in the long

term, even the most economically rational alliances seldom endure the inevitable conflicts and temporary inequities
without a strong social foundation
(Madhok, 1995).
As noted above, our research suggests that, because they allow for the
more effective and efficient functioning
of the alliance relationship, trust and
commitment increase performance.
Here again, a feedback loop exists.
Strong performance influences and reinforces the trust/commitment cycle
making partners even more committed
and more trusting. This likely happens
because of the rational dimensions of
trust and commitment are based in economic considerations. With trust, when
the alliance performs well, the firm will
be even more inclined to behave reliably and credibly, delivering fully on
resources and expertise promised.
When the alliance performs well, a

see greater rewards and higher switching costs.

HOW DO THE JAPANESE DIFFER FROM
THEIR PARTNERS?
Although the Japanese and their partners generally follow similar paths to
the development of trust and commitment, we did find some results unique
to the Japanese.
Although cultural sensitivity toward
others in the alliance relationship is important for developing credibility and
benevolent trust for both the Japanese
and their partners, we found that it is
more important for the Japanese
(Cullen, Johnson, & Sakano, 1995).
This suggests that the Japanese are
more likely to believe that a partner’s
culturally sensitive behaviors and actions communicate the partner’s reliability and goodwill. Similarly, we also
found that the reciprocity of trust is
more important for the Japanese than it
is for their partners. Such findings suggest that the Japanese are more sensitive
to a partner’s signals of trust and maybe
more opened and willing to trust. That
is, when given such signals, Japanese
alliance partners are more likely to increase their own trust of the partner and
begin seeing the relationship in terns of
increasing mutual trust.
We found that for both the Japanese
and their alliance partners, trust is a
major factor in generating commitment.
However, the major driver of commitment for U.S. firms was credibility
trust, the more rational and less emo236 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

tional aspect of trust. The Japanese, in
contrast, responded with higher levels
of commitment to the alliance when
their trust was benevolent, that is, based
more on the emotional, nonrational
component of trust. We suspect that this
finding reflects the cultures and social
institutions of the respective nations.
For the Japanese, commitment to a relationship arises only after participants
have the personal contact to really
“know” a person or company (the affective side of trust). In contrast, in the
individualistic U.S. society, reliable
performances backed by the sanctity of
contracts provide a stronger basis of
commitment.
Although the Japanese seem to respond well to reciprocal trust and see
benevolent trust as a basis for commitment, it would be a mistake to discount
the practical side of Japanese relationship building (Hofstede & Bond, 1988).
The Japanese alliance partners we studied showed, in some cases, a more pragmatic approach to alliance management
than did their partners. For example, in
the equity joint ventures we studied, the
percentage of ownership and percentage
managers on the board of directors were
not as important for the Japanese developing commitment to an alliance as
they were for their partners. Rather, the
Japanese were more committed to alliances when they believed that they had
actual decision making control, even if
this was not associated with their equity
position nor their placement of Japanese
managers and directors in the alliance
organization.
Also in a pragmatic vein, performance on a wider variety of dimensions
seems more important for building Jap-

<-----Page 14----->anese commitment to an alliance than it
is for their partners. Based on some of
our findings regarding Japanese satisfaction with alliances, we suspect that
building commitment to a relationship
for Japanese companies is based on success in an array of strategic issues, not
just financial. These include, for example, the development of human resources, accumulating expertise, organizational learning, reduction of risk,
and market development. When the
Japanese alliance partner believes that
they can achieve these multiple goals in
the long or the short run, then they will
develop a strong commitment to the relationship.

CONCLUSIONS: BUILDING AND
SUSTAINING TRUST AND COMMITMENT
There are several essential factors
that multinational managers need to
consider to build and sustain commitment and trust in international strategic
alliances. These include:
䡠 Pick your partner with trust in mind.
As a major step in alliance implementation, issues considered in picking a
partner must involve more than potential strategic complementary and resource contributions. Alliance partners
must believe that they can trust each
other and they must believe that mutual
commitment is possible.
䡠 Seek a level of trust and commitment that is appropriate for your strategic goals for the alliance. With the benefits of trust and commitment comes
vulnerability. Both alliance managers
and parent company managers must assess the appropriate level benefits and

vulnerability for their unique alliances.
Maximum investment in relationship
capital may not always be required.
Thus, for example, a short-term alliance
may rely mostly on the contract to deliver mutual benefits. In contrast, an alliance with long term goals may emphasis building trust and commitment to
carry the marriage through the inevitable rough times. Fig. 4 illustrates this
tradeoff. The zone of comfort for the
relationship exists below the tradeoff
point where the benefits exceed the vulnerabilities.
䡠 Understand that behaviors and interactions in the relationship serve as trust
or commitment signals to the partner.
This means that managers should attend
to the signals that they are sending to
partners and that they should look for
partner signals and attend to the interpretation. Where appropriate, to build a
strong and effective alliance relationship, focus on signaling the deeper
more emotional levels of trust and commitment. Exercise caution in signaling
instrumental concerns in the relationship such as a dominant focus on monitoring mechanisms (e.g., contracts, reports). Our research coupled with other
preliminary evidence suggests that,
when calculative commitment is the
dominant factor in the relationship, performance is not enhanced and may even
be damaged.
䡠 Gradually reveal your long and shortterm goals for the alliance in concert with
your partner doing the same. Mutual revelations of goals for the alliance is a crucial step in the trust cycle. This allows
partners to realize early in the relationship
whether they can accept each other’s strategic goals and begin at least calculative

commitment. However, alliance partners
must realize that strategic goals for an
alliance may change.
䡠 Seek mutually beneficial situations.
To achieve and maintain mutual commitment and trust in an alliance, each
side must gain something of importance
from the relationship. Although the outcomes from the alliance need not be the
same, both sides must perceive them as
a fair exchange for commitment and
trust to evolve (Beamish, Killing, Lecraw, & Morrison, 1994). Our studies
suggest that commitment in Japanese
strategic alliances increases when both
partners achieve their strategic goals,
even if their goals differ.
䡠 Be patient in the development of
trust and commitment. Participants in
international strategic alliances must re238 Journal of World Business / 35(3) / 2000

alize that trust and commitment cycles
take time to develop and often must
weather problems and conflict. Our
studies suggest that Japanese alliance
partners can tolerate a significant
amount of conflict as long as it does not
become overt and damage the relationship.
䡠 Invest in cross-cultural training. As
with all international ventures, managers with cross-cultural sensitivity and
language competence will likely have
more success in understanding partner
needs and interests (Pucik, 1988). Quality cross-cultural interactions between
partners’ employees will avoid conflict
and misunderstandings, facilitate accurate trust/commitment signaling, and
lead to greater trust and commitment
between partner companies.

<-----Page 16----->䡠 Invest in direct communication. To
overcome national, business, and organizational cultural differences, alliance
partners of the Japanese are more successful at building trust and commitment when they deal with issues faceto-face. Retreating into home company
groups inhibits the speed of the development of trust and commitment cycles.
