<-----Page 1----->What do we mean by
“emerging firm”?
Attempts by individuals to start a new venture.
– Expect to be owners or part owners of a new firm.
– Have been active in trying to start a new firm in
the past 12 months.
– No positive cash flow covering expenses for more
than 3 of those months.

<-----Page 2----->Why emerging firm financing?
• This study explores financing choices made by
entrepreneurs
• Despite a wealth of studies on corporate and SME
financing, little is known about resource acquisition at the
emerging venture stage.
• Firm emergence is a unique phenomenon (Ang, 1991;
1992).

<-----Page 3----->Theories
• Capital structure (Titman and Wessels, 1988)
– Firms choose funding that minimize costs and maximize the
benefits associated with debt and equity

• Agency conflicts (Jensen and Meckling, 1976)
– Shareholders as residual claimants have an incentive to increase
financial risks. Debt holders impose monitoring policies on firm.

• Pecking Order Theory (Myers, 1984; Myers and Majluf,
1984)
– Firms do not aim for target debt ratio. Rather, capital structure
emerges as the firm selects funding that minimizes the cost of
capital

<-----Page 4----->Prior Research
• Firms likely to use capital structure for strategic purposes or to maximize
shareholder returns (Fama and French, 2002; Shyam-Sunder and Myers,
1999)
• Small firms face different agency and information asymmetry challenges
(Ang, 1991)
• Bootstrapping (Winborg and Landstrom, 2000)
• Outside investors of small firms pay close attention to entrepreneur’s
creditworthiness and reputation (Ou and Haynes, 2006)
• Individual characteristics and firm characteristics as determinants of startup financing (Cassar, 2004)
