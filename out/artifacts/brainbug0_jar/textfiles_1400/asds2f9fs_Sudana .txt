ABSTRAK
Prinsip heuristics tidak dapat dikatakan sebagai sebuah pendekatan
pengambilan keputusan yang non-rasional, karena penerapan atau penggunaan
yang unconscious atau subtle mind tidak dapat dianggap sebagai tindakan
yang irrational. Dengan alasan tersebut, terdapat cukup alasan untuk
menyatakan bahwa pengklasifikasian pendekatan-pendekatan keputusan
semestinya menggunakan terminologi analytical dan experiential, dan bukan
memakai istilah rational dan non-rational seperti yang umumnya diikuti.
Penerapan pendekatan heuristics dapat ditemukan pada berbagai disiplin,
termasuk bisnis dan akuntansi. Topik heuristics semestinya mendapat
perhatian yang cukup luas dari para periset di bidang akuntansi. Bidang
behavioral research in accounting menawarkan banyak kemungkinan untuk
dikaji, karena prinsip heuristics bertautan erat dengan aspek manusia sebagai
pelaku dalam pengambilan keputusan.
Keywords: heuristics, decision making, rational choice theory

INTRODUCTION
Rational choice theory, or analytical system (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, &

MacGregor, 2002), argues that decision should be made after considering all
available alternatives. The best decision can be made only if all possible
solutions taken into consideration. However, opinions and evidences do not
always support that argument [see for example (Simon, 1955), (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1974), (Busenitz & Barney, 1997), (Krabuanrat & Phelps, 1998),
(Stoner & Freeman, 1992, p. 259), (Slovic et al., 2002), and (Bonnefon, Dubois,
Fargier, & Leblois, 2008)]. Herbert Simon was among experts questioning

<-----Page 1----->practical application of the rational theory. Simon’s bounded rationality
principle in decision making was developed after his doubt on the acceptability
of that theory. He stated that (Simon, 1955):
“My first empirical proposition is that there is a complete lack of
evidence that, in actual human choice situations of any complexity,
these computations can be, or are in fact, performed”.

In line with Simon’s proposition, Stoner & Freeman (1992, p. 259) mentioned
that in most situations decision makers actually use simpler methods. Human
beings are not like super calculating machines. In making decisions, they tend
to ignore the complicated methods and adopt less complex methods to speed
up the process.
As replacement for the rational model, decision makers practically make
their decision by applying alternative approaches, such as bounded rationality
and rules of thumb called heuristics. By adopting alternative approaches,
decision makers know, assume, and accept if their decisions are influenced by
biases (Stoner & Freeman, 1992, p. 259). Research by Tversky and Kahneman
(1974) has extended Simon’s ideas on bounded rationality. They have
demonstrated that people rely on heuristic principle to simplify decision
making. Heuristic principle is a method of decision making that proceeds along
an empirical lines, using rules of thumb, to find solutions or answers.
This paper aims to discuss heuristic principle as an alternative approach
to decision making. It is expected to give some understanding on how this

<-----Page 2----->principle can be a very useful method under certain circumstances. Certain
articles investigating the principle are posited for further exploration. The rest
of the paper is organized as follows: approaches in decision making, challenges
to rational-economic (analytical) model of decision making, and heuristics
principle and related researches. These theoretical elaborations direct the
discussion part of the paper. The paper ends up with conclusion.

II. THEORITICAL REVIEW
Approaches to Decision Making

Greenberg & Baron (2000, pp. 343-345) identified several different approaches
to how individuals make decision. Three of the most important are:
(1) The rational-economic model: that is theoretically considered as the best
approach in search of ideal decision. An economically rational decisionmaker attempts to maximize profit by searching for the optimum solution
to a problem. For this to occur, the decision maker must have perfect
information and then process it in an unbiased fashion.
(2) The administrative model: that is reckoning for the limits of human
rationality, or what is called as bounded rationality. This model
recognizes that a decision-maker may have a limited view of the problem
confronting it. Thus, in that situation, he or she might selects a solution
that may be good enough but not optimal, termed as satisficing
decisions.

<-----Page 3----->(3) Image theory: an intuitive approach to decision making. This theory
assumes that selecting the best alternative by weighing all options is not
always a major concern when making a decision. In image theory, the
decision making process is both rapid and simple. People make adoption
decisions based on a simple, two steps process: the compatibility test
and the profitability test.
Good decision making is undoubtedly very important to the strategic
success of an enterprise. In a dynamic environment, decision processes not
only need to be well designed but they must also adapt rapidly to changes in
the environment. As noted by Krabuanrat & Phelps (1998), although the
existing researches on decision making have centered around the concepts of
rational and bounded rationality decision processes, recent works have
indicated the acceptance of the third model of decision, based on the use of
heuristics.
Approaches to decision making might be associated with aspects of
human thinking that has been well discussed in other disciplines. Researches
in cognitive and social psychology and in cognitive neuroscience informed us
that there are two basic modes of thinking: experiential and analytic (Slovic et
al., 2002). The experiential mode is characterized by its affective basis. It is
assumed to be related with experience of affect, the subtle feelings of which
people are often unaware. The analytic mode can be tied to the rational choice
theory. Table 1 compares the two modes of thinking.

Challenges to the Rational-Economic (Analytical) Model
The most important characteristic of the rational-economic model is
careful evaluation of each possible alternative. If implemented, step-by-step
processes in the model should be well documented. While the exact number of
stages and their contents vary somewhat from author to author, the general
steps may be summarized as follows (Krabuanrat & Phelps, 1998):
(1) A precise formulation of the problem
(2) Information search
(3) Listing of alternative solutions
(4) Evaluation of alternatives according to predetermined criteria
(5) Choice of solution

<-----Page 5----->Unfortunately for this model, extensive testings, both in laboratory
situations and in the field, have revealed that very few business decisions are
taken in this way [(Jamal & Sunder, 1996),

(Busenitz & Barney, 1997),

(Krabuanrat & Phelps, 1998), (Glockner & Betsch, 2008)]. Although analysis is
certainly important in some decision-making circumstances, reliance on affect
and emotion is a quicker, easier, and more efficient way to navigate in a
complex, uncertain, and sometimes dangerous world.(Slovic et al., 2002)
In conducting their duties, decision makers are affected by biases, make
their decisions become less ideal. Some major factors contributing to the
imperfect nature of individual decisions, (Greenberg & Baron, 2000, pp. 346352), are:
(1) Framing effects
(2) Reliance on heuristics
(3) Bias toward implicit favorites
(4) Escalation of commitments phenomenon

The work of Krabuanrat & Phelps (1998) identified that analysis of
decision protocols provides evidence that heuristics are commonly used both
individually, in combination with others, and in combination with more formal
elements. They pointed out two lessons for strategic decision makers can be
drawn. First, that the options or decision process designed to avoid "garbage
can" processes and optimize decision characteristics in response to needs.
Second, that contrary to a widely held belief, the "rational" model of decision

<-----Page 6----->making may not be an ideal at which to aim (even in the sense of bounded
rationality) for dynamic strategic decisions; instead the development of
heuristics and mental models may present a more relevant aim.

Heuristic Principle and Related Researches
Heuristic principle is a method of decision making that proceeds along
an empirical lines, using rules of thumb, to find solutions or answers (Stoner &
Freeman, 1992, p. 259). In politics, heuristics defined as shortcuts voters use
to decide between candidates (Allen & Wilson, 2009). Heuristics can speed up
decision making, but they are fallible if individuals rely too heavily or taint
them with their own biases. There are two advantages of employing heuristics
in decision making: (1) heuristics have reasonable rationales, so they generally
produce correct results, (2) they save enormous amounts of time for the
decision makers (Stoner & Freeman, 1992, p. 262). This heuristic enables us to
be rational actors in many situations. However, it fails miserably when the
consequences turn out to be much different from what we anticipated. In the
latter circumstances, the rational actor may well become the rational fool
(Slovic et al., 2002).
Stoner & Freeman (1992, p. 259) identified three heuristics in human
decision

making:

availability,

representativeness,

and

anchoring

and

adjustment. Availability heuristic based on assumption that people judge an
event's likelihood by testing it against their memories. Since it is easier to recall
frequently occurring events, thus, events that are more readily available in

<-----Page 7----->memory

are

assumed

to

be

more

likely

to

occur

in

the

future.

Representativeness heuristic assumes people tend to assess the likelihood of
an occurrence by trying to match it with a preexisting category, the
representative, or stereotype. Anchoring and adjustment heuristic argues that
when people make decisions, they start with some initial value, the anchor,
and then make adjustments to that value in order to arrive at a final decision.
As noted by Krabuanrat & Phelps (1998), heuristic principle has recently
gained attention from researchers in the area of business decision making.
However, Bonnefon et al. (2008) admitted that this principle still have received
scarce attention. Among those limited number of researches in heuristics, the
area of coverage includes: qualitative heuristics in decision on two alternative
choices (Bonnefon et al., 2008); biases and heuristic adoption between
entrepreneurs and managers (Busenitz & Barney, 1997); disclosure bias
(Fischera & Verrecchia, 2004); empirical test of the priority heuristic against
cumulative prospect theory (Glockner & Betsch, 2008); affect heuristic as a
function of regulatory focus (Pham & Avnet, 2009); biased heuristics and
Bayesian equilibrium (Jamal & Sunder, 1996); heuristics and rationality in
decision making (Krabuanrat & Phelps, 1998); and implications of the affect
heuristic for behavioral economics (Slovic et al., 2002).

III. DISCUSSION
Decision making is the work of many people in many positions. Without
any doubt, one shall agree that good decision making is very important to the

<-----Page 8----->strategic success of an enterprise. In a dynamic environment, however,
decision processes need not only to be well designed but they must adapt
rapidly to the changes in the environment. For that reason, one can not apply
the best model in every situation faced. A decision maker should be very
flexible in adopting approaches to decision making. There is no best approach
for every problem confronted by decision maker. The best model is the one that
is suitable in decision environment faced by decision makers.
Similar to other approaches to decision making, heuristics principle
could become an appropriate approach in certain circumstances. Some
researches discussed in previous section underlined the acceptance of the
approach in many fields. Although characterized by its speed and simplicity,
heuristic principle cannot be considered as non-rational way of making a
decision. There are strong elements of rationality in all three models of decision
making. When implementing heuristic approach, a decision maker is utilizing
her/his unconscious or subtle mind which has been understood as an
information bank. Slovic (2002) stated:
“It was the experiential system, after all, that enabled human beings to
survive during their long period of evolution. Long before, there was
probability theory, risk assessment, and decision analysis, there was
intuition, instinct, and gut feeling to tell us whether an animal was safe to
approach or the water was safe to drink.”

Since decision making is the work of many people in many positions,
heuristic related researches could be expanded to many areas, including

<-----Page 9----->accounting, as long as the topics under consideration are related to the human
aspect of decision in accounting fields, the area that is covered in behavioral
research in accounting (Arnold, 1997, p. 52). In auditing, decision on client
acceptance might become a subject under examination, since a public
accountant might possibly not employing analytical steps as required by the
professional standards. Many areas of decision in management accounting
should offer a rich occasion to quest the adoption of heuristic principle. In this
area, characterized by dynamic environment and tight competition, decision
processes not only need to be well designed but they must adapt rapidly to
changes in the environment. Of course, the application of heuristic principle in
behavioral research in accounting is not limited only in the areas just
discussed. Beyond that, there are a lot of possibilities waiting to be uncovered.
IV. CONCLUSION
Heuristic principle is not a non-rational approach to decision making,
since utilizing unconscious or subtle mind cannot be considered as irrational.
It should be arguable if the classification of the approach should be in favor of
analytical and experiential terms than rational and non-rational notions.
Adoption of heuristic approach can be observed in many areas of discipline,
including business and accounting. The topic should be of accounting
researchers interest as well. The area of behavioral research in accounting
offers a vast array of possibility to be examined, since heuristic principle is
tightly related to human aspect of decision making.
