The venture capital market plays a significant role in
providingcapitalto a wide varietyof enterprises.While Fried
and Hisrich(1994), Sahlman(1990) and Barry,Muscarella,
Peavy, andVetsuypens(1990) have examinedthe value of a
venture capitalist after an investment is made, this paper
focuses on the way the venturecapitalistmakes the investment decision. (In the rest of this paper,venturecapitalists
will be referredto as VCs.)
The decision to invest is a difficult one with serious
adverse selection risk. Once an investment is made, the
investmentis illiquid,and its success is highly dependenton
a small group of managers/entrepreneurs. Significant
information asymmetries allow managers to engage in
opportunisticbehaviorafteran investmentis made(Sahlman
(1988)), making it all the more importantthat the initial
decision to invest be a good one.
Opinionsvaryabouthow successfulVCs arein allocating
resources.Chan (1983) and Sahlman(1990) argue that the
presence of a VC encourages efficient capital allocation.
Amit, Glosten, and Muller(1990a, p. 110), though,aremore
critical,stating:
Under the currentinstitutionalstructureof the venture
capital industry,the most promising entrepreneurswill
not seek venturecapitalfinancing,and arelikely to make
slower progressin the developmentand commercialization of emerging technologies. Further,those entrepreneursthatarebackedby venturecapitalare less likely to

succeed in developing their ventures because of their
relativelylow ability.
If we are to know whether the venture capital market
allocates resources properly, we need to understandhow
VCs make investment decisions. This problem can be
expressed in two relatedquestions:"What criteriado VCs
use to evaluatepotentialinvestments?"and "What process
do VCs use to evaluatepotentialinvestments?"
Our study of venture capitalist decision making uses a
two-stage research methodology. First, we gathered data
from eighteen VCs in three differentregions of the United
States. Personal interviews about the investment process
each used on their most recent investments yielded
informationthat we analyzed for generic criteria.We then
developed a model of the investmentprocess. The second
stage involved verifying the model and its genericcriteria.
There is prior research on the criteria VCs use in
evaluating potential investments. Some examples are
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), MacMillan, Siegel, and
Subbanarasimha (1985), and MacMillan, Zemann, and
Subbanarasimha(1987). These researchersuse relatively
simple, structured-mailquestionnairesasking VCs to rank
the importanceof various criteria.This methodology has
been criticized on several points by Sandberg,Schweiger,
and Hofer (1988).
Studies by Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990) and Hall and
Hofer (1993) examinethis topic using significantlydifferent
methodologies. Neither work examines the entire process
involved in making an investmentdecision. Sandberget al.
(1988, p.13) summarize the problems with the existing
research:

DECISIONMAKING
/ TOWARDA MODELOF VENTURECAPITALINVESTMENT

It is graduallybecoming clear thathumandecision making cannotbe understoodby simply studying final decisions. The perceptual,emotionaland cognitive processes
which ultimatelylead to the choice of a decision alternative must also be studied if we want to gain an adequate
understandingof humandecision making.
The earliestVC decision process studywe find is a study
of VCs in Pittsburghby Wells (1974). This model of the
process is modifiedandelaboratedon by TyebjeeandBruno
(1984). While this model defines stages in the process, the
underlyingTyebjee and Brunostudy focuses on investment
criteriaanddoes not examinethe specific activitiesthatVCs
undertake.
Ourworkexaminesthe entireprocess,using actualcases.
From our study of the cases, we propose a model of the
process and identify generic investmentcriteria.
The VC investmentdecision-makingprocess is designed
to reducethe riskof adverseselection.The VC aids suppliers
of capitalby servingbothto produceinformationandto make
decisions. VCs also benefit the usersof capitalby providing
both equity (on a confidential basis) and non-financial
resources,such as business advice. By reducinginformation
and contractingcosts, the VC can supplyequity to firmstoo
small to access the public equity marketefficiently.

I. Methodology
Traditional financial research methodologies are not
well-suited to an examination of the venture capital
investment process. The transactionsinvolved are private.
What little information that is available from secondary
sourcesdescribesthe ultimateinvestmentbutnot the process
used to make it.
Ourtwo-stage methodologyaddressesthis problem.The
initial stage is a multiple-casestudyto gatherinformationon
which to base a model. Then, an industrypanelcritiquedand
verified the model.

29

VCs were asked to describethe investmentprocess each
followed in their most recent investment as lead investor.
Focus on an actual investment eliminates any problems
associated with hypothetical or non-contingentresponses.
Use of the most recent investmentshelps to ensure that the
recollection is more accurate.Because the financialresults
of the investment were then unknown, this techniquealso
minimizes any tendencyof self-reportingbias. Finally, and
perhapsmost important,sequentialdecision making could
be examined.
The authors (who have extensive interviewing
experience) conducted and recorded all interviews. The
transcriptsgave us 18 case studiesdescribingthe investment
process in a variety of different industries and stages of
companyinvestment.Table 1 providesa brief descriptionof
each case. Investmentsstudiedrangein size from $50,000 to
$6 million.

To obtaindatawith more informationalcontentthanthat
used in prior studies (Harrigan(1983)), we interviewed 18
VCs personally and followed up with a structured
questionnaire.We choose six representativeVCs in each of
three regions with significant venture capital
activity-Silicon Valley, Boston/Cambridge, and the
Southwest United States. Choices were based upon
recommendationsof a panelof industryexperts.Eachperson
interviewedis associatedwith an establishedventurecapital
fund. The amountof funds undermanagementvaries from
$4 to $450 million, with a mean fund size of $99 million and
a medianfund size of $50 million.

also asked for descriptivedata about the firm, such as fund

One of the authors and an outside researcher
independentlytried to fit each case into the Tyebjee and
Brunomodel. While the resultswere generallysupportiveof
that model, there were some majorexceptions. A modified
model was then createdusing a replicationlogic (Eisenhardt
(1989)). This approachproposesmodificationsto a model to
deal with flaws in the initial version. Modificationsarethen
tested againsteach case untilthe case supportsthe proposed
modification.The resultingmodel was thenverifiedthrough
a second study (discussed later).
The cases and writtenquestionnaireswere analyzedfor
specific activitiesperformedby venturecapitalists.Because
the characteristicsof a venturevaryby stage of development
(Kazanjianand Drazin(1989), RuhnkaandYoung, (1987)),
the VCs were divided into late- and early-stageinvestors.
In the first two interviews,the VCs were asked how they
assessed the various investment criteria suggested by
MacMillanet al. (1985). Responsesindicatedthatthese VCs
do not use these explicitcriteriain evaluatingventures.These
comments,coupled with the numerousobjectionsraisedby
Sandberget al. (1988) to the MacMillancriteriaindicatethat
the MacMillancriteriado not adequatelydescribethe VCs'
criteria.We thenused a groundedtheoryapproachto develop
a new set of generic criteria(Glaserand Strauss(1967)).
The grounded theory approach is a highly iterative
process that uses cross-case comparisons to develop
hypotheses.Thehypothesesarethentestedagainsteachcase.
Hypothesesare then refinedand new hypothesesdeveloped
on the basis of these tests and resultsfrom earlierpublished
studies.The resultinggenericcriteriawere thenexaminedby
an industrypanel.

B. Industry Panel
After developmentof the model and generic criteria,we
presentedthe results of the initial study to five new VCs,
selected to representa broadrange of firms and geographic
areas. Two of the five are large Midwestern firms
emphasizinglate-stage investments;one is a large Silicon
Valley/New Yorkfirmthatinvests in all stages;one is a New
York venturecapital subsidiaryof a majorEuropeanbank
that focuses on large, late-stage investments;and one is a
moderatelysmall, Pittsburgh-basedVC firm that invests in
all stages.
Each was mailed a summaryof the model and generic
criteria.They also received a copy of Table 2 with brief
comments on the differences observed between early- and
late-stage investors. We made furthermodificationsto the
model based on theirresponses.

II. Results
We describe results first in terms of the generic criteria
and then as they fit the process model.

A. Generic Criteria
Fifteen criteriacommon to the investmentsstudiedwere
identified.Giventhe breadthof investmentsstudied,it seems
safe to call these criteriaa commonbase for VC investments.
These criteria expand upon the three basic constructs
identified by Hisrich and Jankowicz (1990): concept,
management,and returns.Concept has four components.
First,theremustbe significantpotentialfor earningsgrowth.
This is obvious for early-stageventures,which may not be
generatingrevenuesyet, butit is also importantfor late-stage
investments.It is difficult, if not impossible, to get venture
capitalratesof return(30%to 70%IRRs)withoutsignificant
earningsgrowth.Earningsgrowthmay come from a rapidly
growing market or through increasing market share or
significantcost cutting.
Second,the investmentmustinvolve a businessidea(new
product,service, or retailconcept)thatworksalreadyor can
be broughtto marketwithin two to three years. Third,the
conceptmustoffer a substantial"competitiveadvantage"or
be in a relatively non-competitive industry. Fourth, the
concept must have reasonableoverall capitalrequirements.
This criterionwas addedat the suggestion of the two large
investorsin the industrypanel. One states:
In today's environmentan entrepreneurwould be well
servedto develop a businessplan for which the totalcash
requirementto achieve self-fundingis withinthe reachof
the venturecapitalistand his originalinvestmentgroup.
If not, both he and the original investment group are
subject to being washed out in subsequentfinancings,
even if the companyhas done moderatelywell, due to the
limited availabilityof growthcapital.
The otherraised a concern as to whetheradditionalmoney
was availableanywhereandalso pointedoutthathigh capital
requirementscould seriously impactROI.
Managementis also an importantconsideration.Thereare
several attributes VCs want to see in managers. First,
managersmustdisplaypersonalintegrity.Second,they must
have done well at priorjobs. The trackrecorddoes not have
to be with the currentcompany. Association with losing
venturesin the past does not disqualifythe entrepreneursif
they can show they personallyperformedwell in the earlier
venture. In later-stageinvestments, the focus tends to be
more on performanceon the currentjob.
Managers must be realistic. VCs try to judge the

need to be hardworking,flexible, and have a thorough

importantfor early-stageventures.

as significant in an early-stage venture as long as the

major differences in their judgment as to how well a

B. A Model of the Decision-Making Process
The decision-makingprocesscanbe modeledin six stages
as shown in Figure 1. The process is time-consumingand
labor-intensive.VCs indicate it takes on average 97.1 days
(s.d. = 45.0) for an investmentto pass throughthese six stages

proposal for which they serve as lead investor, the process
requires 129.5 hours of theirtime (s.d. = 99.8).
Origination. The first phase is origination.While VCs
generally wait for deals to come to them, they do make
themselves known to companies through industry
directories. The bulk of the VCs' efforts to generate
investment proposals focus on developing a network of
referrers.While VCs receive many deals "cold" (without
any introduction),they rarelyinvest in them. None of the 18
deals in the study was received cold. Most fundedproposals
come by referral.Occasionally, the VC alreadyknows the

founder through work either as a manager of a prior
investmentor a consultant.
The referreddeals in our study come from a variety of
sources: investment bankers, investors in the VCs' fund,
commercial bankers, management of firms in the VCs'
portfolio,consultantswho hadworkedfor the VC in the past,
and family friends. There are two reasons for this heavy
incidenceof referrals.First,referreddeals aremore likely to
pass throughthe generic screen if the VC has confidence in
the referrer'sjudgment.Second,the referreris more likely to
understandwhat type of investments the VC might find
attractive.
A growing minorityof VCs aggressively seek out deals
and, in some cases, may actually help create them. In one
at a partywhen
case in the study,the VC met theentrepreneur
the entrepreneurwas working for a Fortune 100 company.
Whenthey discusseda technologyin whichthe VC was very
interested, the VC was impressed by the entrepreneur's
knowledge and invited the entrepreneurto contacthim if he
was ever interestedin startinghis own company.A year and
a half laterthe entrepreneurcalled-without a business plan
andwith only a rudimentaryknowledgeof business.The VC
workedwith the entrepreneurto develop the business side of
the concept and to write a business plan. Only afterthe plan
was writtendid the VC invest any money.
VC Firm-Specific Screen. ManyVCs have firm-specific
criteriaon investmentsize, industriesin which they invest,
geographic location of the investment, and stage of
financing.The firm-specificscreeneliminatesproposalsthat
clearly do not meet these criteria.1 At most, the firm
specific-screeninvolves a cursoryglance at the businessplan
withoutany analysis of the proposal.
Generic Screen. Many proposals pass through the
firm-specific screen only to be rejected without extensive
review when the VC analyzes the proposed investmentin
termsof the genericcriteria.Most deals thatpass throughthe
firm-specificscreen are rejectedat the generic screen based
upona readingof thebusinessplancoupledwithanyexisting
knowledge the VC may have relevantto the proposal.The
generic screen will be less rigorously applied when the
quality of referreris high. The net result of the two screens
is thatmost proposalsarerejectedwith minimalinvestment
of time.
First-Phase Evaluation. After proposals pass through
the generic screen, the VC begins to gather additional
informationaboutthe proposal.One VC with experienceas

opportunitiesoutsidethatscreenmay still have anopportunityto be funded."

a commerciallenderin a money centerbanktold us thatthe
VC process is much more involved thanbank loan reviews.
At the same time, thereareof coursesome limits. As one VC
says: "If you reallywantedto haveall the marketchecksand
talk to all the customerspriorto puttingin your first dollar,
not very many ventureswould get off the ground."
Table 2 providesa list of activitiesthatVCs undertakein
the evaluation phases. Evaluation involves general
monitoring by the VC. In these phases, the information
gathered from both company and outside sources is
comparedto the informationin the entrepreneur'sbusiness
plan. "We filter all these reportsin just like an intelligence
officer would in the army-a lot of sources-you know,
some reportsare good and some reportsarebad."
After clearing the generic screen, a proposal's progress
through the remaining stages is not preordained, as is
indicatedby the wavy line in Figure 1.As one VC comments:
It's not a nice slow curve where you sort of get mildly
interestedand then come to a crescendo at the end. It's
more the other way around.And you have peaks and
valleys in the middle.
The first-phaseevaluationgenerallystartswith a meeting
with the principalsof the companyseeking financing.As the
proposalis being evaluated,a series of meetings with all the
top managementteam will occur. These meetings have two
goals: to increasetheVC's understandingof the businessand
to allow assessment of the manager'sunderstandingof the
industry, the proposal, and problems that may be
encountered.They also providean opportunityto assess how
managersthinkand behave.
One VC even wants to visit an entrepreneur'shome and
meet the family. He explained:
I like to go out and meet the spouse and the kids and try
to see if their home is in chaos or if it's prettyorderly.
Ratherthanme passingjudgmenton how they live, what
I want to understandis what kind of environmentthat
entrepreneur'scoming out of.

ability of managementto react underpressure.As one VC
states:

we might lean on them a little bit to see what kind of
pressurepoints they have.... We see how they interact
with theirmanagementteam,andwe ask questionswhere
we know there'sgoing to be some controversyto see how
they handleit.

entrepreneur. The extent of reference checking varies
dependingon the VC's priorknowledgeof the entrepreneur.
Accordingto one VC, the abilityto get references,as well as
other people, to "really talk" is one of the factors
differentiatinga good VC from a bad one.
Late-stageinvestorsaremorelikely to talkto accountants
than early-stage investors, reflecting applicability of the
financial history available. Information availability also
leads late-stage investors to engage more frequently in
libraryresearch.Late-stageinvestorsare also more likely to
talk to banks,but banksare not viewed as particularlyfrank
sources, especially if owed money.
Both existing and potential customers are contacted to
determine why they are buying or not buying from the
company.In the case of the educationalsoftwarecompany,
the VC accompaniedthe company's managementto sales
presentationsmade to school boards to see the reaction of
potential customers. Similarly, early-stage investors may
contactpotentialcustomersbefore a producthas been fully
developed. In the case of the semi-conductor materials
producer, the VC, through a personal contact, located a

a potential purchaser of the product and discussed the
productconcept.
Formalmarketstudies may also be made, sometimes by
outside consultants.VCs reportdoing this only about 30%
of the time, for several reasons. First, a great deal of
informationis almost always in the business plan. Second,
contacts with customers and potential customers provide
additionalinformation.Third, sometimes the marketis not
clearly defined.
In the case of the microcomputerdisplay,the VC felt that
the marketwas not totally analyzable,as nothing similarto
the productexisted. He explained:
Basically you look at the applications-radio pagers.
How many radio pagers are sold per year? How may of
those radio pagers are alpha-numericversus simpleminded numeric ones?... So you got a gazillion radio
pagers.... And you factorthatout and you say, "OK, this
will get 10 or 15%of the radiopager market."And you
can workthroughsome numbers,but in the end you have

/ AUTUMN1994

Technical studies of a productare used much more by
early-stage investors than late-stage, because late-stage
investors can get a good feel for the state of the company's
technology by talkingwith customersand industryexperts.
Early-stageinvestorsachieve theirtechnologicalevaluation
in a variety of ways. Several early-stage investors have
formalaffiliationswith technologyexperts.One of the firms
in our studyis associatedwith a consultingfirm well-known
for technology assessment. Another VC firm uses
"technology partners,"consultantsformallyaffiliatedwith
the firm who drawa retainerandparticipatein profitsbut do
not make any investment decisions. Other early-stage
investors handle technology assessmenton an informal,ad
hoc basis.
VCs often discuss an investmentwith managersin some
of theirexisting portfoliocompanies,particularlywith those
in closely-related industries. These portfolio companies
might also be customersor potentialcustomers,or suppliers
or potentialsuppliers,of the company underconsideration.
Early-stage investors tend to contact management of
portfolio companiesmore than late-stageinvestorsbecause
they tend to specialize more by industryand are therefore
more likely to have portfolio company managers with
relevantinformation.
VCs also talk to each other. Their experience with
proposals they have analyzed and investments they have
made gives VCs knowledge that might be useful to others.
In fact, as Reiner'shistoryof the industry(1989) points out,
VCs have traditionallyinvestedthroughloose syndicates.To
some extent this is to pool capitalin orderto sharerisk and
increase the absolute amount of capital that can be can
invested in any one company.Syndicatesare also formedin
order to share knowledge, according to Bygrave and
Timmons(1992). In fact, some of the firms in our study will
not become the sole investorin a company. (Lerner(1994)
describesthe syndicationprocess.)
VCs analyzepro formafinancialprojectionspreparedby
the entrepreneurto assess a project's potentialfor earnings
growth, as well as gain informationabout management's
understandingof their proposaland theirrealismtowardits
future. The financial projections provide a basis for
comparisonwith the market value of other companies, to
give the VC an estimateas to the potentialvalue thatcan be
receivedwhen it exits the investment.(See Morris(1989) for
an exampleof how valuationis doneby a late-stageinvestor.)
Late-stage investments have more historical financial
information available, which allows a more meaningful
analysis.
Second-Phase Evaluation. At some point the VC
develops an "emotional"commitmentto a proposal,which

marksthe startof the secondphaseof the evaluationprocess.
Evaluationactivities continue, but the amountof VC time
spent on the proposalincreasesdramatically,and the VC's
goal changes.While in the firstphasethe goal is to determine
whetherthereis seriousinterestin a deal, in the second phase
the objectis to determinewhatthe obstaclesto theinvestment
are andhow they can be overcome.2
The degree to which firms formally recognize the
movement from first to second evaluation phase varies
greatly. The same is true for the shift from second-phase
evaluationinto the closing stage. These last threestages are
not clearly distinguishablein all VC firms.
Because of the significant amount of time spent in the
secondphase,VCs like to have at leasta roughunderstanding
about the structure of the deal, including price, before
entering this phase. This keeps the VC from devoting
significanttime evaluatingproposalsthatultimatelywill not
be investablebecause they arepricedtoo high. Since totally
unrealistic initial pricing proposals from the entrepreneur
may lead to a quick turn-down,some entrepreneurssubmit
proposalswithouta price to avoid negativelyinfluencingthe
VC in the generic screen and first-phaseevaluationstages.
Two of the deals in our study did not requirea defined
evaluation phase after the formal request for funding was
made. In one case, the VC had spenta substantialamountof
time helping the entrepreneurspreparethe business plan.
With this active involvement in creationof the deal, there
was no needfor a separateevaluationphase.Inthe othercase,
the VC had turnedthe deal down a few yearsearlierbut had
stayed in regularcontactwith the companysince.
Closing. After progressing through the second-phase
evaluation,the proposalenters the closing stage, where the
details of the structureare finalized and legal documents
negotiated.Afterthe documentsare signed, a check is given
to thecompany.Even thoughbothVC andentrepreneurhave

Second, the VC can ask for significant changes in the
originalproposal.This happenedin 4 of the 18 cases studied.
It is not unusualfor new managersto be addedas a condition

may simply go ahead and do the deal even though some
serious concernsare present.
Finally, by far the most commonresponseis to rejectthe
deal. Sometimes proposalsrejectedearliermay reappearin

this assumptiondoes not hold, theirmodel predictsthat the
market will not break down. Thus, it is important to
determinewhethermost entrepreneursseeking VC funding
have the optionof fundingtheirventureswith personalfunds
or borrowing.
While ourstudyis not specificallydesignedto answerthis
question,as partof the studywe did look at 18 entrepreneurs
seeking VC financing. None of the 18 had the financial
ability to fund their enterprisefully with personalfunds or
borrowing.Thus underAmit's model, the marketshouldnot
breakdown in any of the cases examined.

The VC does not serve merely as an

a decision-making agent. As Sahlman points out, VC
investment decisions involve a great deal of uncertainty.
Often two investorsmay come to differentconclusionson a
project, even with the same information. Most VC
partnerships are structured so that the VC has total
decision-making authority (Terms and Conditions of
VentureCapitalPartnerships(1987)). Inthis study,few VCs
even consulted with their investors before making an
investment.
VCs arebetterableto makeinvestmentdecisions thanare
theirinvestors.Barryet al. (1990) andMegginsonandWeiss
(1991) show that the capital markets attach value to the
post-investmentactivities of a VC, assuming that VCs are
better at overseeing and guiding new enterprisesthan the
investor.Similarly,Friedand Hisrich(1989, 1992) find that
venturecapital investorswant theirfunds managedby VCs
who are experienced,provendecision-makers.
The VC also offers demand-sidebenefitsthat may make
it more attractiveto the entrepreneurthan a public equity
offering. In addition to providing capital, the VC may
provide business advice, contacts, and reputationalcapital
thatarenot availablefromthe public equitymarkets(1990).
Anotherdemand-sidebenefit is confidentiality.A public
offering requires the entrepreneur to make certain

the significanceof confidentialityin debt markets.
Finally, Fama and Jensen (1983a, 1983b) point out that
public equity is unavailable to most entrepreneurs.The
amount of money needed may not be enough to achieve
minimumefficient scale in the public equity market.Public
equity has high fixed informationand contractingcosts. By
reducinginformationand contractingcosts, the VC is able

C. Suggestions for Future Research
There are several importantareas for future research.
First,becausethe numberof VC firms involved in this study
is small, the model needs to be validatedfurtheron a larger
sample througha structuredmail questionnaire.
Second, our generic model was developed to cover all
types of VCs. Not all VCs are the same, so the differences
between variousVCs need to be explored.Some differences
involve those between early- and late-stage investors.
Elango, Fried,Hisrich,and Polonchek(1994) identifyother
sources of differences, including geographic location and
firm size. Also, our study follows only AmericanVC funds.
The venture capital industry outside the U.S. has grown
explosively in recent years and is now largerthan the U.S.
industry.Bygrave and Timmons (1992) point out that the
natureof the industryvaries from countryto country.
Finally, one must ask, "How do the benefits thatventure
capitalistsprovide as intermediariescompareto the costs?"
While we show thatthe role of an intermediaryis valuable,
the VC style of investing has high costs. VC funds
traditionallypay a managementfee of 2.5% of assets per
year,as well as 20%of any profits.Moreempiricalworkwill
be neededto explore in what situationsventurecapitalcosts
arejustified. E
