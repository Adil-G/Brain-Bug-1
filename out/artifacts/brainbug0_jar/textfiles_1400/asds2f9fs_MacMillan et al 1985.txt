A questionnaire was administered to one hundred venture capitaiists to
determine the most important criteria that they use to decide on funding
new ventures. Perhaps the most important Jinding from the study is direct
confirmation of thefrequently iteratedposition taken by the venture capital
community that above all it is the quality of the entrepreneur that ultimately
determines the funding decision. Five of the top ten most important criteria
had to do with the entrepreneur’s experience or personality. There is no question that irrespective of
the horse (product), horse race (market), or odds t’financial criteria), it is the jockey (entrepreneur)
who fundamentally determines whether the venture capitalist will place a bet at all.
The question is if this is the case, then why is so much emphasis placed on the business plan?
In a business plan there is generally little to indicate the characteristics of the entrepreneur-it
is
generally devoted to a detailed discussion of the productlservice, the market, and the competition. To
us, the implications are obvious-such
content is necessary, but not suficient. The business plan
should also show as clearly as possible that the “jockey is fit to ride”-namely,
indicate by whatever
feasible and credible means possible that the entrepreneur has staying power, has a track record, can
react to risk well, ana’ has familiarity with the target market. Failing this, he or she needs to be able
to pull together a team that has such characteristics and show that he or she is capable of leading
that team.
Factor analysis of the results indicate that venture capitalists appear to assess ventures systematically in terms of six categories of risk to be managed. These are: risk of iosing the entire
investment; risk of being unable to bail out tf necessary; risk offailure to implement the venture idea:
competitive risk; risk of management failure; and risk of leadership failure.
Finally, three clusters of venture capitalists were ident$ed: those who carefully assess the
competitive and implementation risks; those who seek easy bail out; and those who deliberately keep
as many options open as possible.

capitalists when they evaluate venture proposals. The objectives of study were
threefold. First, it was intended as a follow up and replication of the study reported by
Tyebjee and Bruno (198 I), but for a broader group of venture capitalists and at a later period
in time.
Second, it is hoped that the results will provide members of the venture capital community (as well as other institutions providing funds for new ventures) with an aggregate
picture of what the most common current criteria are and what current weights are being
attached to each criterion by their peers. Finally, the results should provide those seeking
funds with an idea of what the critical criteria are. They can then assess how their ventures
compare with these criteria and take the steps necessary to resolve any major flaws in their
proposals before submitting them. Given that most venture capital firms are operated with
lean staff, the fact that they are inundated with proposals becomes a significant bottleneck
in their operations. Two disadvantages result-first
the venture capitalist’s time is consumed
with the processing, evaluation, and subsequent rejection of flawed proposals, which unneccesarily distracts them from more productive activities; second, some viable proposals
are rejected because they have flaws that could have been removed if the entrepreneurs were
alerted to them before they were submitted to the venture capitalist.
By expanding venture capitalists’ awareness of the weights being attached to various
criteria by their peers, and by alerting those seeking venture capital funds to potential flaws
that can be rectified before submission, it is hoped that enhanced knowledge of evaluation
criteria will help make the venture capital market a little more efficient.

First, fourteen venture capitalists in the New York rne~~li~n
area were inte~iewed
in
order to establish what criteria they use in evaluating venture proposals. Twenty-seven such
criteria were identified, collated, and assembled in Table 1. The criteria were classed into
six major groups. In Table 1 were group I, those to do with the entrepreneur’s personality;
group II, those to do with the entrepreneur’s
experience; group III, those to do with the
characteristics of product/service;
group IV, those to do with characteristics of the market;
and group V, those to do with financial considerations.
In Table 2 was group VI, those
criteria that had to do with composition of the venture team.
These criteria were then assembled into a questionnaire.
The first 24 criteria were
scaled on a four point scale, as per Table 3. In this questionnaire,
a four point scale was
deliberately chosen in such a way that each advance up the scale represents a distinct and
clear increase in the importance of the criterion.
As a check on consistency, we also asked the respondents to specify the five most
impo~~t
criteria. These selections should correlate highly with the criteria that had been
rated highest in the first part of the questionnaire.
This turned out to be the case.
The questionnaire was mailed to all members of the National Venture Capital Association, and all members listed in Venture Magazine’s 1983 Directory of Venture Capitalists.
A total of 150 questionnaires
was sent out, and 102 responses were received, indicating a
very high level of interest in the project.
In the questionnaire we also asked respondents to list any additional criteria that they
considered to be important. Only five additional criteria were suggested, none of which were
reported by other respondents. We took this as evidence that the additional criteria suggested
were not widely used.

Such a study has all the weaknesses of a self-report study. It is possible that respondents
could be influenced by their perception of what is a desirable response or a response that is
seen as appropriate to their position as representatives of the venture capital community,
rather than the criteria they actually use. There is also a danger that some respondents may
not actually use the criteria in the ways that they think they do, This will be tested in a later
study. Given these limitations, the results reported below need to be interpreted with some
circumspection.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
Means and standard deviations
means and standard deviations,

of the responses appear in Table 1. From a review of these
one can make the following observations,

Personality and Experience
The most important personality characteristics are evidence of staying power and an ability
to handle risk. Given the low standard deviation of the result for staying power, it is clear
that there was high consensus on the need for staying power.
On the other hand, venture capitalists in general claimed they were not much concerned
with whether the entrepreneur had a compatible personality. However, the high standard
deviation for this criterion does indicate that some venture capitalists do regard it as important,
but not essential.
There was high consensus that the key experience requirement was a thorough familiarity with the target market. Almost as important were demons~t~
leadership capability
and a track record that is relevant to the venture. Of least concern was the need of the
venture capitalist to be familiar with the entrepreneur’s reputation.

Product and Market Characteristics
The most important product characteristic appears to be some proprietary protection. On the
other hand, venture capitalists claimed that the need for the product to be “high tech’ was
not important. This is a surprising claim, given that about 70% of all ventures are in the

<-----Page 4----->VENTURE

PROPOSALS

high tech category (Venture Capital Journal 1984). However, the high standard deviation
for this variable indicates that there are many who regard high tech as important.
The critical market requirement is a high growth rate. In general, other market characteristics were not regarded as important.

Fiiancial Considerations
As expected, the key financial concerns are with high upside potential and high investment
liquidity. Most venture capitalists recognize that the payout is only likely in 10 years, rather
than 5 years, but still expect a handsome return on that investment. Of least concemgenerally considered irrelevant-was
whether or not they were involved in the first round
of financing and whether or not they would be expected to make subsequent investments.
In general, personality and experience concerns dominate the financial criteria, which in
turn are regarded as more important than product or market criteria.

F-LAWED VENTURES
The next issue of interest is the degree to which certain venture characteristics disqualify
them for the venture capitalist. To assess this we identified the 10 criteria that were most
frequently rated as essential by the respondents. The results are listed in Table 4. Note that
a rating of “essential” means that the responding venture capitalist would reject the plan
regardless of any other characteristics, no matter how redeeming.
In Table 4, five of the ten criteria most commonly rated as essential have to do with
the entrepreneurs themselves-by
and large venture capitalists will not back ventures unless
the entrepreneur is capable of sustained effort, has demonstrated leadership in the past,
evaluates and reacts to risk well, has a track record relevant to the venture, and is capable
of articulating the venture well.
What becomes even more interesting is to identify the characteristics of “critically
flawed” proposals-that
is, proposals that would be rejected by a significant majority of
venture capitalists if they had only two flaws. These results are in Table 5, which lists the
ten most serious combinations of flaws.

The results of Table 5 can be interpreted in the following way. Take item one on the
list. If a new business were proposed in which the entrepreneurs appeared to have little
staying power and the business did not at least show the potential for delivering a return of
10 times within 10 years, then 84% of all venture capitalists in the sample (a sample that
is highly representative of the whole venture capital community) would reject the proposal,
however redeeming its other features may be. Such a proposal would be critically flawed,
in that it would get an “audience” with only 15% of the venture capital community, who
would then still assess it for further flaws. So its chances of being funded at all would be
miniscule unless the proposers of the venture could find some way of identifying and
compensating for these critical flaws.
In every case in Table 5 the critically flawed ventures had at least one criterion that
concerned the entrepreneur’s personality or experience. So entrepreneurs seeking funding

who have any of these personality or experience flaws must realize that they are wasting
their time unless they can assemble around them a team of people who can compensate for
these flaws.
Table 6 reinforces this point-it
shows that just under one-half of venture capitalists
will not even consider a venture that does not have a balanced team for the venture. Once
again, the venture would be rejected irrespective of how glamorous the industry was or
exciting the proposed product was.

FACTOR ANALYSIS
In order to explore whether them was a more general pattern underlying the venture capitalists’ responses, the data were factor analyzed. Because many of the criteria were not
considered to be important by respondents, only those factors that had a mean score significantly greater than 2.0 were included in the factor analysis. This means that all criteria
with a mean score of less than 2.8 were excluded (t = 1.98, P < 0.05).
The results of the
factor analysis are reported in Table 7.
In attempting to explain these factors, we fell back on a concept elaborated by Driscoll
(1974) who suggested that the role of the venture capitalist goes beyond the mere provision
of funds to the venture, He contended that the real challenge to the venture capitalist lies

in managing the risks of the venture. This theme of “managing the risk” is what seems to
draw together the evaluation criteria that were loaded onto each factor.
Factor 1 is associated with a concern with competitive risk. A venture with a proprietary
product that has little threat of competition within 3 years and an existing market is clearly
competitively insulated.
Factor 2 reflects a concern with managing bail out risk. Venture capitalists who are
thoroughly familiar with the industry and have a highly liquid investment in that industry
will be confident that they will know when to bail out and be able to do so if necessary.
Factor 3 represents a concern with investment risk. Ventures run by meticulous entrepreneurs, with sound track records, in high growth markets, and the prospect of 10 times
payback in 5-10 years are relatively insulated from the threat of total loss of the investment.
Factor 4 relates t6 management risk. The venture capitalist who backs a venture where
the entrepreneur is capable of intense sustained effort, knows the market thoroughly, and
reacts well to risk will be relatively comfortable that the venture will not be mismanaged.
Factor 5 taps implementation risk. Ventures in which the entrepreneurs have a clear
idea of what they are doing, who have already developed a functioning prototype, and which
product has a demonstrated market acceptance are more cushioned from product and market
development failures.
Factor 6 reflects a concern with leadership risk. It stands apart from other characteristics
of the entrepreneur, such as staying power, experience, ability to evaluate risk, and so on,
and addresses the issue of whether the entrepreneur is also able to lead others. If the
entrepreneurs cannot do this, then despite their other positive characteritics the venture could
still fail. Unfortunately,
this is a single item factor. Future research could include more
items that tap leadership qualities.
Tyebjee and Bruno (198 1) independently developed a questionnaire with the six factors
that they identified have a number of areas of high correspondence. First they found a factor
that they called uncontrollable
risk, which paralleled our competitive risk. Second, their
cash out factor paralleled our bail out risk. Next, their quality of management factor was
associated with the management risk that appeared in our study; their viability factor approximated the implementation
risk that our analysis identified; and their market factor
correlates with the investment risk we found.
The major shift that has occurred since Tyebjee and Bruno’s study is that venture
capitalists in the mid-1980s have reduced their expectation of specific skills (marketing,
technical, and so on) on the part of the entrepreneur and shifted these expectations to the
venture team.
From the above discussion, the factors that were identified seem to tap all the major
risks associated with new ventures. To the extent that the venture capitalists can screen
ventures and accept those that have some insulation from each of the above risks, they will
have done everything possible to manage the risk of the ventures in which they do invest.

CLUSTER

ANALYSIS

The last area of interest is whether there are any broad types of venture capitalists, with
common approaches to the overall evaluation of venture proposals. To determine this, we
carried out a cluster analysis of all criteria that had a mean value significantly greater than
2.0. The cluster analysis for which the cubic clustering criterion appeared to have a change
in slope was not distinct, but occurred between the 3 and 4 cluster solution. In the interest
of parsimony, we selected the 3 cluster solution. The results are presented in Table 8.

The first cluster, which represents about 40% of the venture capitalists in the sample,
was representative of a group of venture capitalists we called “Purposeful Risk Managers.”
This group of venture capitalists is inclined to expect several attributes in the venture that
assure that the various risks that were identified in the factor analysis are well managed.
This group seeks the following: entrepreneurs with demonstrated leadership skills and a
product and market with characteristics that clearly reduce the risk to manageable levels.
They prefer protectable products, for which a prototype has been developed; there is clear
market acceptance in an existing market with which the venture capitalist is familiar and in
which the threat of early competition is low. Whereas few ventures will have all of these
characteristics, the venture capitalists in this group seek ventures that are high on as many
of these as possible-the
idea being to manage down the inherent uncertainty of venturing
by seeking such risk managing characteristics at the very start of the venture.
The second group of venture capitalists is totally different, so much so that they have
been dubbed “Determined Eclectics,” because they appear to deliberately impose an absolute
minimum number of restrictions on what ventures they will be prepared to consider. Thus
they rate most criteria low compared to the purposeful risk managers. This is not a surprising
result. A substantial number of venture capitalists take pride in being open to all types of
venture proposals and in being prepared to consider any deal. Whether the openness to

127

<-----Page 9----->128

ET AL.

review deals is translated in equally broad based investment behavior is another issue. They
comprised a solid 33% of all the venture capitalists in our sample.
Finally, there is a group of about 25% of the venture capitalists whom we call “Parachutists.” They are perfectly willing to support most ventures as long as they feel that they
have a high liquidity “parachute” via which to escape with if things go wrong. In fact, they
appear to feel that as long as they have an entrepreneur who has staying power, a venture
in an indust~ with which they the venture capitalists are familiar, and a highly liquid
investment, they can commit to any such venture, secure in the knowledge that they will
be able to spot problems and bail out if necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
Perhaps the most important finding from the study is direct confirmation of the frequently
iterated position taken by the venture capital community that above all it is the quality of
the entrepreneur that ultimately determines the funding decision. In Table 1, five of the top
ten most important criteria had to do with the entrepreneur’s experience or personality. In
Table 5, every pair of criteria included at least one that concerned the entrepreneur. There
is no question that irrespective of the horse {product), horse race (market), or odds (financial
criteria) it is the jockey (entrepreneur) who fundamentally
determines whether the venture
capitalist will place a bet at all.
The question is if this is the case, then why is so much emphasis placed on the business
plan’? In a business plan there is generally little to indicate the characteristics of the entrepreneur-it
is generally devoted to a detailed discussion of the produc~se~ice,
the market,
and the competition. Such content is necessary, but not sufficient. The business plan should
also show as clearly as possible that the ‘jockey is fit to ride”-namely,
indicate by whatever
feasible and credible means possible that the entrepreneur has staying power, has a track
record, can react to risk well, and has familiarity with the target market. Failing this, he or
she needs to be able to pull together a team that has such characteristics, and show that he
or she is capable of leading that team.
This study benelitted
the questionnaire.
