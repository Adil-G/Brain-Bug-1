Regulatory Focus and Strategic Inclinations:
Promotion and Prevention in Decision-Making
ELLEN CROWE AND E. TORY HIGGINS
Columbia University

A promotion focus is concerned with advancement,
growth, and accomplishment, whereas a prevention
focus is concerned with security, safety, and responsibility. We hypothesized that the promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and insure against errors of
omission, whereas the prevention focus inclination is
to insure correct rejections and insure against errors of
commission. This hypothesis yielded three predictions:
(a) when individuals work on a difficult task or have
just experienced failure, those in a promotion focus
should perform better, and those in a prevention focus
should quit more readily; (b) when individuals work
on a task where generating any number of alternatives
is correct, those in a promotion focus should generate
more distinct alternatives, and those in a prevention
focus should be more repetitive; and (c) when individuals work on a signal detection task that requires them
to decide whether they did or did not detect a signal,
those in a promotion focus should have a “risky”
response bias, and those in a prevention focus should
have a “conservative” response bias and take more
time to respond. These predictions were supported in
two framing studies in which regulatory focus was
experimentally manipulated independent of valence. q 1997 Academic Press

A strategy refers to a pattern of decisions in the acquisition,
retention, and utilization of information that serves to meet certain objectives, i.e., to insure certain forms of outcome and to
insure against certain others.

Probably no motivational principle has received more
attention than the hedonic principle that people approach pleasure and avoid pain. Biological models have

distinguished between the appetitive system involving
approach and the defensive or aversive system involving avoidance (e.g., Gray, 1982; Konorski, 1967; Lang,
1995). Models in personality and social psychology have
distinguished between the motive to move toward desired end-states and the motive to move away from
undesired end-states (e.g., Atkinson, 1964; Bandura,
1986; Carver & Scheier, 1981, 1990; Lewin, 1935, 1951;
McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, & Lowell, 1953; Roseman,
1984; Roseman, Spindel, & Jose, 1990). But it is not
only hedonism that underlies approach and avoidance
strategies. The present paper considers the approach
and avoidance strategies that derive from an independent principle of motivation, “regulatory focus,” and
examines their implications for decision-making while
problem-solving.
A self-regulatory system can have either a desired
or an undesired end-state functioning as the reference
value. The system attempts to move the current actualself state as close as possible to a desired end-state and
as far away as possible from an undesired reference
point. Carver and Scheier (1981, 1990) refer to the former discrepancy-reducing system as an approach system and the latter discrepancy-amplifying system as
an avoidance system. They also suggest that the discrepancy-reducing system is more common than the
discrepancy-amplifying system. Higgins, Roney, Crowe,
and Hymes (1994) proposed that there are two alternative means or strategies for accomplishing discrepancy
reduction—approach actual self states that match the
desired end-state or avoid actual self states that mismatch the desired end-state. A person who wants to
get a good grade on a quiz (a desired end-state), for
example, could either study hard at the library the day
before the quiz (approaching a match to the desired
end-state) or turn down an invitation to go out drinking
with friends the night before the quiz (avoiding a mismatch to the desired end-state). Thus, different approach and avoidance strategies can be used in the
service of the same general approach system. Higgins

CROWE AND HIGGINS

et al. (1994) proposed that individuals’ chronic self-regulation in relation to different types of desired selves
exemplifies this strategic distinction.
Self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987) distinguishes
between two types of desired end-states: (a) ideal selfguides, which are individuals’ representations of someone’s (self or other) hopes, wishes, or aspirations for
them; and (b) ought self-guides, which are individuals’
representations of someone’s beliefs about their duties,
obligations, and responsibilities. Self-regulation in relation to either ideal or ought self-guides is discrepancyreducing and involves approach at the general system
level. Higgins et al. (1994) proposed, however, that ideal
and ought self-regulation differ in their strategic inclination.
Actual self congruencies to hopes, wishes, or aspirations represent the presence of positive outcomes
whereas discrepancies represent the absence of positive
outcomes. Thus, the psychological situations involved
in ideal self-regulation are the presence and absence of
positive outcomes (see Higgins, 1989). Unlike hopes,
wishes, and aspirations that function like maximal
goals, duties, obligations, and responsibilities function
more like minimal goals (see Brendl & Higgins, 1996).
These are goals that a person must attain or standards
that must be met. When strong enough, such as biblical
commandments, oughts can even function like necessities. Discrepancies to such minimal goals represent the
presence of negative outcomes whereas congruencies
represent the absence of negative outcomes (see Gould,
1939; Rotter, 1982). Thus, the psychological situations
involved in ought self-regulation are the absence and
presence of negative outcomes.
Higgins et al. (1994) proposed that the concern of
ideal self-regulation with positive outcomes (their presence and absence) should engender an inclination to
approach matches to hopes and aspirations as a strategy for ideal self-regulation. In contrast, the concern
of ought self-regulation with negative outcomes (their
absence and presence) should engender an inclination
to avoid mismatches to duties and obligations as a strategy for ought self-regulation. In one of their studies,
Higgins et al. (1994) tested these predictions by first
asking undergraduates to report either on how their
hopes and aspirations have changed over time (to prime
or activate ideal self-guides) or on how their duties and
obligations have changed over time (to prime ought
self-guides). Next, the participants read about several
episodes that occurred over a few days in the life of
another student, completed a filler task, and then tried
to remember the episodes in a free recall task. The
episodes all described the target as trying to experience
a desired end-state but varied in the strategy used, as
in the following examples: (a) “Because I wanted to be

at school for the beginning of my 8:30 psychology class
which is usually excellent, I woke up early this morning.” [approaching a match to a desired end-state]; and
(b) “I wanted to take a class in photography at the
community center, so I didn’t register for a class in
Spanish that was scheduled at the same time.”
[avoiding a mismatch to a desired end-state]
As predicted, the participants remembered episodes
that exemplified approaching matches to desired endstates significantly better when ideal versus ought selfregulation was activated, whereas they remembered
episodes that exemplified avoiding mismatches to desired end-states significantly better when ought versus
ideal self-regulation was activated. A second study
found that individuals with strong ideal self-regulation
versus strong ought self-regulation selected different
tactics when asked about their strategies for friendship,
with the former selecting tactics that involved approaching matches (e.g., “Be supportive to your friends.
Be emotionally supportive”) and the latter selecting tactics that involved avoiding mismatches (e.g., “Stay in
touch. Don’t lose contact with friends”).
The results of this and other studies (see Higgins et
al., 1994; Higgins & Tykocinski, 1992) supported the
proposal that ideal self-regulation involved a concern
with positive outcomes (presence and absence) and a
predilection for approach means to obtain desired endstates, whereas ought self-regulation involved a concern with negative outcomes (absence and presence)
and a predilection for avoidance means to obtain desired
end-states. But more generally, ideal and ought selfregulation can be considered as involving two types of
regulatory focus (see Higgins, 1996a). Ideal self-regulation has a promotion focus whereas ought self-regulation has a prevention focus. To appreciate better the
nature of these two types of regulatory focus, their hypothesized involvement in self-guide acquisition will be
described briefly (for a fuller discussion of socialization
processes, see Higgins, 1996a).
The child experiences the presence of positive outcomes when caretakers, for example, encourage the
child to overcome difficulties or set up opportunities for
the child to engage in rewarding activities, and the
child experiences the absence of positive outcomes when
caretakers, for example, take away a toy when the child
refuses to share it or stop a story when the child is not
paying attention. The caretaker’s message to the child
in both cases is that what matters is attaining accomplishments or fulfilling hopes and aspirations, but it is
communicated in reference to either a desired or an
undesired state of the child—either “This is what I
would ideally like you to do” or “This is not what I would
ideally like you to do”. The regulatory focus is one of

<-----Page 2----->REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

promotion, i.e., a concern with advancement, growth,
accomplishment.
In contrast, the child experiences the absence of negative outcomes when caretakers, for example, train the
child to be alert to potential dangers or teach the child
to “mind your manners,” and the child experiences the
presence of negative outcomes when caretakers, for example, yell at the child when he or she does not listen
or criticize the child when he or she makes a mistake.
The caretaker’s message to the child in both cases is
that what matters is insuring safety, being responsible,
and meeting obligations, but it is communicated in reference to either a desired or an undesired state of the
child—either “This is what I believe you ought to do”
or “This is not what I believe you ought to do.” The
regulatory focus is one of prevention, i.e., a concern with
protection, safety, responsibility.
These caretaker–child interactions occur over long
periods and consist of a child’s significant other communicating about the child’s contingencies in the world.
The different messages engender ideal self-regulation
involving a promotion focus concerned with advancement, growth, accomplishment or ought self-regulation
involving a prevention focus concerned with protection,
safety, responsibility. But regulatory focus should not
be limited to such chronic individual differences. After
all, momentary situations should also be capable of temporarily inducing either a promotion focus or a prevention focus. Just as the responses of caretakers to their
children’s actions provide feedback to the children
about how to attain desired (rather than undesired)
end-states, feedback from a boss or a teacher communicates to an employee or a student, respectively, how to
attain desired end-states. And such feedback can occur
in a momentary situation without there being a long
history or strong relationship between the interactants.
Thus, promotion or prevention feedback, whether it concerns a desired state (positive feedback) or an undesired
state (negative feedback), should be capable of inducing
a temporary state of regulatory focus that influences
motivation.
This possibility was tested in a recent study by Roney,
Higgins, and Shah (1995). Undergraduate participants
worked on a set of anagrams that included both solvable
anagrams and unsolvable anagrams. The participants
were given 45 s to solve each anagram but they could
quit before the time was up. Success or failure feedback
was given after each problem. Half of the participants
received promotion focus feedback, such as “Right, you
got that one” (presence of positive) when they solved
an anagram or “You didn’t get that one right” (absence
of positive) when they did not solve an anagram. The
other half of the participants received prevention focus
feedback, such as “No, you missed that one” (presence

119

of negative) when they did not solve an anagram and
“You didn’t miss that one” (absence of negative) when
they solved an anagram. After the first trial in which
feedback was given, the participants immediately performed a second trial without feedback. The results for
this trial are of special interest because there was no
longer feedback but a regulatory focus had been induced
from the first trial. For the unsolvable anagrams, the
study found that participants with a prevention focus
quit before the time was up on 19% of the problems,
whereas participants with a promotion focus quit on
only 4% of the problems.
The results of this study suggest that feedback is
capable of inducing temporarily either a promotion focus or a prevention focus, and this in turn can influence
motivation to persist on a task. But feedback is not
the only situational variable that should be capable of
inducing different types of regulatory focus. To use
again the analogy of caretaker–child interactions, it
should be possible to induce a regulatory focus with
instructions that present a task contingency concerning
which actions produce which consequences, i.e., how
to attain desired (versus undesired) end-states. This
possibility was tested in a second study by Roney et al.
(1995) on motivational persistence.
Undergraduate participants were told that they
would perform two tasks. For everyone the first task
was an anagrams task that included both easy anagrams pretested to be solvable by everyone and unsolvable anagrams. All of the participants were told that
the second task would be either a computer simulation
of the popular “Wheel of Fortune” game or a task called
“unvaried repetition” described in such a way as to
appear very boring. Although the performance contingency for playing the fun game rather than the boring
game as the second task was the same for everyone, the
framing of the contingency was experimentally varied.
Half of the participants were given a promotion focus
in which they were told that if they solved 22 (or more)
out of the 25 anagrams they would get to play the
“Wheel of Fortune” game, otherwise they would do the
“unvaried repetition” task. The other half of the participants were given a prevention focus in which they were
told that if they got four (or more) out of the 25 anagrams wrong, they would do the “unvaried repetition”
task, otherwise they would play the “Wheel of Fortune”
game. The time participants spent working on the unsolvable anagrams was recorded. Consistent with the
results of the first study described earlier, this study
found that participants with a promotion focus persisted over one-third longer on the unsolvable anagrams than participants with a prevention focus.
The results of these two recent studies suggest that

<-----Page 3----->120

CROWE AND HIGGINS

regulatory focus can be induced situationally and influence motivation. Thus, regulatory focus is not just an
individual difference variable relevant to chronic personal predilections. Rather, it concerns different selfregulatory states. Individuals can be chronically predisposed to experience a particular state or it can be induced in them temporarily by properties of the current
situation. In either case, individuals in a promotion
focus state versus a prevention focus state will have
different strategic inclinations. Let us reconsider, then,
the nature of this difference in strategic inclinations.
A promotion focus is concerned with advancement,
growth, accomplishment. Goals are hopes and aspirations. The strategic inclination is to make progress by
approaching matches to the desired end-state. In contrast, a prevention focus is concerned with security,
safety, responsibility. Goals are duties and obligations
or even necessities. The strategic inclination is to be
prudent and precautionary and avoid mismatches to
the desired end-state. Given these differences, one
would expect that people’s self-regulatory states would
be different when their focus is promotion versus prevention. With a promotion focus, the state should be
eagerness to attain advancement and gains. With a prevention focus, the state should be vigilance to assure
safety and nonlosses.
How might a state of eagerness versus a state of
vigilance impact strategic inclinations? In signal detection terms (e.g., Tanner & Swets, 1954; see also Trope &
Liberman, 1996), individuals in a state of eagerness
from a promotion focus should want, especially, to accomplish “hits” and to avoid errors of omission (i.e., a
loss of accomplishment). In contrast, individuals in a
state of vigilance from a prevention focus should want,
especially, to attain correct rejections and avoid errors
of commission (i.e., making a mistake). Thus, to use
Bruner et al.’s (1956) classic terminology cited earlier,
the promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and
insure against errors of omission, whereas the prevention focus inclination is to insure correct rejections and
insure against errors of commission.
How might these different strategic inclination impact behavior on an anagram task as used by Roney et
al. (1995)? An anagram task requires participants to find
one or more words hidden in a letter string. Success at
finding a word would be a correct acceptance or “hit”
whereas failure to find a word would be an error of omission. On this task, then, the promotion focus individuals
should be eager to find words (“hits”) and to avoid omitting any possible words. This should yield high persistence and a strong desire to find words following a failure
to find any. In contrast, the prevention focus individuals
should be vigilant against nonwords and want to avoid
committing the error of producing them. When difficulty

is experienced, this orientation might motivate quitting
to avoid explicitly committing an error.
The findings of Roney et al. (1995) need to be reconsidered in light of this analysis. The unsolvable anagrams
in their studies appeared among the first few problems,
and thus the participants experienced failure early on
in the tasks. This early failure experience might have
been necessary to produce the regulatory focus difference that was found. One of the aims of our first study
was to examine directly for the first time whether anagram performance on solvable anagrams is better with
a promotion focus than a prevention focus only when
participants are experiencing difficulty. A new “embedded figures” task was also included in our first study
in order to consider this possibility more generally. It
was expected that individuals in a prevention focus
would quit an especially difficult hidden figure before
the time limit was up in order to avoid committing a
mistake, whereas individuals in a promotion focus
would persist longer to prolong the opportunity for a
“hit.” To broaden our examination of this issue still
further, an additional counting backward task was also
included that had an easy sequence followed by a difficult sequence. It was expected that a performance advantage of the promotion focus would emerge only during the difficult sequence.
A more central purpose of our first study (as well as
the second study) was to address a limitation of the
Roney et al. (1995) studies that is evident in the general
literature as well. In manipulating regulatory focus,
the first “feedback” study controlled for valence by including both positive and negative feedback within each
regulatory focus condition. The second “task contingency” study confounded regulatory focus and valence
by framing the contingency positively for the promotion
focus and negatively for the prevention focus. To address this limitation, the present studies used the “task
contingency” paradigm and independently manipulated both the regulatory focus and the valence of the
contingency framing. Thus in the context of contingency
framing, the present studies examine for the first time
how regulatory focus as one motivational principle and
valence or hedonic value as a separate motivational
principal influence strategic inclinations, both independently and in combination.
The other major aim of the present studies was to investigate an additional implication of the hypothesized
strategic inclinations that has not previously been examined. Specifically, one would expect differences in the
strategic motivation to generate alternatives. Some
tasks allow people to produce few or many alternatives
without penalty. On a sorting task, for example, individuals could use the same criterion, such as color, to sort a
set of fruits and to sort a set of vegetables or they could

<-----Page 4----->REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

use different criteria, such as color for the fruits and
shape for the vegetables. Either strategy is considered
correct. The requirement is only that the sorting criterion be consistent across all members of a category. Thus,
individuals can reduce the likelihood of making a mistake and still be correct by simplifying the task, such as
sticking to one criterion for both categories. Individuals
in a vigilant state from a prevention focus want to avoid
errors of commission and thus should be inclined to be
repetitive. In contrast, individuals in an eager state from
a promotion focus want to accomplish “hits” and thus
should be inclined against a strategy that omits alternatives. Thus, when the task permits, one would expect
such individuals to use different criteria.
This hypothesized difference in strategic inclinations
for considering alternatives was tested in our first study
by including two additional tasks among the initial set
of tasks. One of these tasks was a sorting task like the
one just described. A second task was a characteristic
listing task that permitted generating many different
alternatives. Participants are presented with the
names of furniture objects, such as desk, couch, or bed,
and are asked to write down all of the characteristics
they can think of for each object. It was hypothesized
that individuals with a promotion focus, compared to
individuals with a prevention focus, would be more fluent in listing unique characteristics for the different
members of a category because of their stronger strategic inclination to generate many different alternatives
when possible. In contrast, individuals with a prevention focus, who are inclined to avoid errors of commission, should be more repetitive than individuals with
a promotion focus (controlling for fluency).
The first study examines performance when experiencing difficulty and generating alternatives. Each of
these measures permits a test of the proposal that individuals in an eager state from a promotion focus are inclined to insure hits and insure against errors of omission, whereas individuals in a vigilant state from a
prevention focus are inclined to insure correct rejections
and insure against errors of commission. Given that this
proposal was inspired by a signal detection analysis, it
would be reasonable to test it as well with a signal detection task. This was the aim of our second study which
examined decisions on a recognition memory task.
STUDY 1
Method

Participants
Columbia University undergraduates were paid to
complete a battery of questionnaires. Of those who had
appropriately filled out the critical questionnaires for

121

the study, 138 were randomly selected and scheduled
to participate as paid subjects in the experiment that
took place approximately two months after the battery.
Materials
As part of the battery completed weeks before the
experiment, all participants filled out the Task Rating
Questionnaire and the Selves Questionnaire.
Task rating questionnaire. This questionnaire asks
respondents to rate 16 tasks or activities on a
7-point Likert scale, from 23 (Dislike Very Much) to
13 (Like Very Much). The tasks included such activities
as solitaire, alphabetizing, playing a video game, proofreading, transcribing audiotapes, and playing blackjack
(“21”). Each participant’s most liked task and least liked
task were selected from their ratings to be used as part
of the experimental framing to be described later.
Selves questionnaire. This questionnaire asks respondents to list up to 8 or 10 attributes for each of
three different self-states: (a) their actual self, the kind
of person they believe they actually are; (b) their ideal
self, the kind of person that someone (self or other)
would ideally like them to be, someone’s hopes, wishes,
and aspirations for them; and (c) their ought self, the
kind of person that someone (self or other) believes
they ought to be, someone’s beliefs about their duties,
obligations and responsibilities. The questionnaire is
administered in two sections, the first involving the
respondent’s own standpoint and the second involving
the standpoints of the respondent’s significant others
(i.e., mother and father). The magnitude of the selfdiscrepancy between the actual self and each of the
ideal and ought self-states is calculated by summing
the total number of mismatches with the actual self,
then subtracting the total number of matches with the
actual self (see Higgins, Bond, Klein, & Strauman,
1986). Because the present studies were concerned with
how situationally-induced regulatory focus influences
strategic inclinations, we wanted to control for the effects of chronic strategic predispositions. Thus, the different self-discrepancies were included as covariates in
the multiple regression analyses.
Mood questionnaire. During the experimental session, measures of participants’ mood were taken to
check on whether the experimental framing manipulation itself or the tasks themselves had emotional effects.
We did not expect to produce changes in emotions because the participants were given no feedback about
their level of performance and, indeed, there was no
right or wrong answer on two of the five tasks used.
Still, we were concerned about this possibility because

<-----Page 5----->122

CROWE AND HIGGINS

any change in the participants’ mood might itself influence their strategic inclinations. The mood measures
permitted us both to check on and to control for this
possibility. Mood was assessed three times—once at the
very beginning of the experimental session, once about
halfway through the study (i.e., after the sorting task),
and again at the very end of the session.
The Mood Questionnaire contained 16 different mood
terms. Because ideal self-regulation produces
cheerfulness/dejection-related emotions whereas ought
self-regulation produces quiescence/agitation-related
emotions (see Higgins, 1996b), the mood questionnaire
was constructed to include positive and negative items
from each of these two emotional dimensions: (a) cheerfulness-related feelings (happy, upbeat and satisfied);
(b) dejection-related feelings (discouraged, sad, and disappointed); (c) agitation-related feelings (uneasy, tense,
and worried); and (d) quiescence-related feelings (calm,
secure, and relaxed). The remaining four mood terms
were general feelings unrelated to these two emotional
dimensions. Most of the mood terms were taken from
two mood factors in the Semantic Differential Mood
Scale (Lorr and Wunderlich, 1988)—Cheerful–
Depressed, and Relaxed–Anxious. Some more extreme
items (e.g., gloomy) were changed to less extreme items
(e.g., discouraged). For each mood term, the respondents were asked to indicate which extent rating “best
describes HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW” on a 5-point
Likert scale that ranged from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very).
All of the participants worked on the following five
tasks in the order listed:
Characteristic listing. This task was based on an
attribute listing task employed by Mikulincer, Kedem,
and Paz (1990). Participants were presented with the
names of eight objects, each on a separate sheet of paper, and were told to write down all of the characteristics they could think of for each object. Participants
were given 1 1/2 min per object. They completed the
pages in the order presented, and could not look forward
or backward at pages other than the one they were
working on. The eight objects, on eight different pages,
were (in order of appearance): desk, couch, bookcase,
table, cabinet, bed, chair, mirror. All objects were members of the superordinate semantic category of furniture
as determined by Rosch (1975).
Counting backwards. Participants in this task verbally counted backwards from a given number by an
assigned decrement. They were given 1 min in which
to do so, and were told that the purpose of the task was
to see how many numbers they could get in a minute.
They performed this task two times. The first trial involved decrements of 6, which is relatively easy, and

the second trial involved decrements of 9, which is relatively difficult.
Sorting. This task was based on a sorting task employed by Mikulincer, Kedem, and Paz (1990). Participants were given a set of 12 members of a given category, and were instructed to sort or separate this set of
items into subgroups according to a single criterion or
dimension which made sense to them. They first sorted
a list of fruits and then sorted a list of vegetables. Only
the names of the items appeared on each page—no pictures were included. The fruits and vegetables listed
were all members of the semantic categories as determined by Rosch (1975). The twelve fruits were [listed
in order]: orange, strawberry, banana, pear, lime, pineapple, apple, grapes, blueberry, raspberry, watermelon,
plum. The twelve vegetables were [listed in order]: peas,
cucumbers, green beans, spinach, eggplant, corn, lettuce, beets, celery, carrots, green peppers, broccoli.
There was no time limit, and there were no restrictions
on the number of subgroups or the number of items per
subgroup. The only stipulation was that the subgroups
represent different values on the same dimension (e.g.,
fruits of different colors). After completing the second
page in which they sorted vegetables, the participants
were asked on the third page to write down as many
different criteria as they could think of, as many dimensions as possible, for separating the same set of 12
vegetables into subgroups, excluding the dimension
they had used to sort the vegetables on the previous
page. They were allowed as much time as they needed
to complete this exercise.
Embedded figures. This task was developed by Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, and Karp (1971; see also Ruebush,
1960). As described by them, the participant’s “task on
each trial is to locate a previously seen simple figure
within a larger complex figure which has been so organized as to obscure or embed the sought-after simple
figure (p. 3).” The simple and complex figures were
geometric shapes that fit on 39 3 59 cards. The simple
design was always present in the complex one. Additionally, the simple figure was always right side up
and had the same size inside the complex figure. Three
minutes (180 s) was allotted for each figure. Given that
the norms for college students fall in the range of 46
to 70 s per figure for this test (Witkin et al., 1971),
this was considered to be an ample amount of time for
participants to work on each figure. The participants
were given seven embedded figures. Six of the figures
were in color and one was in black and white. Pretesting
of the figures had indicated that the black and white
figure was clearly the most difficult. This difficult figure

<-----Page 6----->REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

permitted a test of persistence by measuring the percentage of participants in each condition who quit working on the figure.
Anagrams. The participants were asked to complete four anagrams, one per page. The instructions
were to complete the pages in order, and the participants were not allowed to return to a page once they
had completed it. There was no time limit per page.
The four anagrams, in order, were: “cleets”, “tisrnp”,
“tohcass” and “wderra”. The first two had two solutions
each, and the last had four solutions. The third anagram was unsolvable. Participants were told that each
anagram could have multiple solutions or no solution.
Before beginning, the participants were given a practice
anagram that was easier than the task anagrams.
Procedure
Upon arriving at the experimental session, the participants were asked to complete the Mood Questionnaire. They were told that studies have shown that
mood can influence performance and such effects would
interfere with the aims of our research. Thus, we would
like to determine whether mood is influencing performance on our study so that we can correct for it if it is.
Using the participants’ earlier idiographic responses
to the Task Rating Questionnaire, one activity was selected for the experiment that a participant clearly liked
and another was selected that the participant clearly
disliked. After completing the Mood Questionnaire, the
participants were told that they would first perform
an initial set of five exercises [the experimental tasks
described above] and then they would be assigned a
final task. The liked activity (e.g., playing a video game)
and the disliked activity (e.g., proofreading) were each
fully described as an alternative final task that a participant might perform. Props related to a participant’s
alternative final task were also included (e.g., a deck
of cards for solitaire) to convince participants that either of these tasks could be their final task. The debriefing at the end of the experimental session indicated
that the participants believed that they would perform
one of these tasks during the session.
Four of the experimental framing conditions were
contingency conditions in which participants were told
that which of the alternative final tasks they would
work on at the end of the session depended on their
performance on an initial set of five exercises [the five
experimental tasks providing the dependent measures]. The relation between the initial set of exercises
and the final task was described as contingent for everyone, but the framing varied in different conditions as
a function of both regulatory focus and valence. All
instructions began with, “We’re now going to have you

complete a series of different attention and problemsolving measures. Your performance on these tasks will
determine what your final task will be, and it will be
one of 2 things, either [participant’s liked task] or [participant’s disliked task].” The instructions then varied
across conditions, as follows:
(a) Promotion Working—“If you do well on the exercises I’m about to give you, you will get to do the [participant’s liked task] instead of the other task.”
(b) Promotion Not Working—“If you don’t do well
on the exercises I’m about to give you, you won’t get to
do the [participant’s liked task] but will do the other
task instead.”
(c) Prevention Working—“As long as you don’t do
poorly on the exercises I’m about to give you, you won’t
have to do the [participant’s disliked task] but will do
the other task instead.”
(d) Prevention Not Working—“If you do poorly on
the exercises I’m about to give you, you will have to do
the [participant’s disliked task] instead of the other
task.”
In addition to these four contingent framing conditions, there was also one experimental noncontingent
framing condition. Here the relation between the initial
set of exercises and the final task was described as
noncontingent. The two alternative final tasks were
described and the participants were told that one of
these tasks would be randomly assigned to them, as
follows: “We’re now going to have you complete a series
of different attention and problem-solving measures.
After you have completed these tasks, your final task
will be randomly assigned to you, and it will be one of
two things, either [participant’s liked task] or [participant’s disliked task].” By including a noncontingent
framing condition, it was possible to examine how the
variable of contingency per se influenced strategic inclinations.
The participants were randomly assigned to one of
the above five framing conditions upon arrival at the
experiment. There were 28 participants in the “Promotion Not Working” condition and 29 in the “Prevention
Working” condition. There were 27 participants in each
of the remaining three conditions. Each participant remained in one of these five conditions while working
on all of the initial set of exercises. The participants
were reminded of their specific contingency or noncontingency condition halfway through the initial set of
tasks (i.e., after the sorting task), and they filled out the
Mood Questionnaire for the second time at this point.
After finishing the Anagrams task, the participants
filled out the Mood Questionnaire for a third time. At
this point, the experiment was over. All participants
were told that they had done well on the exercises. They
were then thanked and fully debriefed.

Results and Discussion

Methods of Analysis
Multiple regression analyses were performed on the
dependent variables to assess the independent effects
of each framing variable while controlling for all the
other variables. Differences among the four contingency
framing conditions were examined by including two
different framing variables in the analysis. The first
framing variable was Regulatory Focus, distinguishing
between promotion focus conditions (Promotion Working; Promotion Not Working) and prevention focus conditions (Prevention Working; Prevention Not Working).
The second framing variable was Valence, distinguishing between pleasant or positive valence conditions
(Promotion Working; Prevention Working) and painful
or negative valence conditions (Promotion Not Working;
Prevention Not Working).
Differences between the four contingency framing
conditions combined and the noncontingency framing
condition were also analysed as a Contingency variable
(Contingency Framing; Noncontingency Framing).
Two- and three-way interaction terms were also included in the multiple regression to determine whether
any interaction effects occurred among Regulatory
Focus, Valence, and Contingency. Finally, each regression analysis included participants’ ideal and ought discrepancy scores as covariates. (Possible interactions between self-discrepancies and the other variables were
also investigated but none were significant.)
Motivational Response to Difficulty
It was proposed earlier that the promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and insure against errors of
omission, whereas the prevention focus inclination is
to insure correct rejections and insure against errors
of commission. When a task becomes difficult, or just
following failure, promotion focus individuals should be
eager to find “hits” and insure against omitting any
possible “hits,” whereas prevention focus individuals
should be vigilant against mistakes and insure against
committing the error of producing them. When a task
becomes difficult, then, one would expect promotion
focus individuals to perform better and prevention focus
individuals to quit more readily. The results on three
of the tasks are relevant to this hypothesis.
Anagrams. The participants completed two solvable anagrams before encountering the unsolvable anagram. They were given as much time as they wanted
to work on each of the anagrams and time spent working on the anagrams was included as a covariate. A
regression analysis on the number of solutions found for
the first two solvable anagrams revealed no significant

effects (all F’s , 1). In contrast, a regression analysis on
the number of solutions found for the solvable anagram
that followed the unsolvable anagram (controlling for
solutions to the anagrams preceding the unsolvable
anagram and time spent on the unsolvable anagram)
revealed a significant effect of regulatory focus, F(1,115)
5 4.6, p , .05. As predicted, participants in the promotion focus condition found more solutions (M 5 1.5; with
a maximum of 4) than participants in the prevention
focus condition (M 5 1.0). There were no other significant effects.
Embedded figures. As discussed earlier, the embedded figures task permitted an additional test of the
effects of task difficulty on persistence because it included one especially difficult problem. The participants were given the option of quitting any embedded
figure and moving on to the next one if they wanted;
that is, they were told that at any time they could stop
searching for any simple figure they had not yet found.
The participants rarely quit searching for more than
one of the embedded figures and, as expected, the figure
that they typically quit was the most difficult one. (It
was the fifth problem in the sequence of seven problems.) A logistic regression analysis on quitting this
difficult figure revealed a borderline significant effect
of regulatory focus, Wald 5 3.37, p , .07. As expected,
the participants in the prevention focus condition were
more likely to quit this difficult figure (54%) than the
participants in the promotion focus condition (35%).
Counting backwards. This task included both relatively easy and relatively difficult trials of counting
backwards. It was hypothesized that higher motivation
and performance with a promotion than a prevention
focus would appear when the task became difficult. The
participants were given two trials of counting backwards, counting first by an interval of 6 and then by a
interval of 9. As expected, the participants found the
first trial easier as reflected in their counting markedly
faster on the first trial (M 5 21.7 numbers/min) than
on the second trial (M 5 14.8 numbers/min), F(1,117)
5 10.9, p , .0001.
A regression analysis first revealed a significant effect of contingency on counting speed during the first
trial, F(1,118) 5 7.9, p , .01, reflecting the fact that on
the first trial participants in the contingency condition
counted more quickly (M 5 22.4 numbers/min) than
participants in the noncontingency condition (M 5 18.7
numbers/min). The effect was in the same direction on
the second trial but it was nonsignificant. There were
no other main effects but there was a significant Regulatory Focus 3 Trial Order interaction, F(1,117) 5 3.9,
p 5 .05. Consistent with our prediction, on the easier

<-----Page 8----->REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

first trial the participants in the prevention focus condition were somewhat faster (M 5 22.9 numbers/min)
than participants in the promotion focus condition (M
5 21.9 numbers/min), whereas on the more difficult
second trial the prevention focus participants were
somewhat slower (M 5 14.7 numbers/min) than the
promotion focus participants (M 5 15.3 numbers/min).
It should be noted, moreover, that the slower speed of
the prevention focus participants on the second trial
was not in the service of reducing errors because, if
anything, they also had more errors on the second trial
(M 5 1.3) than the promotion focus participants
(M 5 0.9).
Generating Alternatives
It was proposed earlier that, given a task where generating any number of alternatives is correct, individuals in a prevention focus state would tend to be relatively repetitive and generate less alternatives than
individuals in a promotion focus state. We proposed
that individuals in a vigilant state from a prevention
focus want to avoid errors of commission and thus
should be inclined to use the strategy of sticking to as
few alternatives as possible and repeating ones already
used. On the other hand, sticking to as few alternatives
as possible means that some possibilities will be omitted
during the task. We proposed that individuals in an
eager state from a promotion focus want to accomplish
“hits” and thus should not be inclined to use this strategy. Indeed, in a task where many different alternatives
could be produced, we proposed that these individuals
would be inclined to generate many different alternatives. Both the characteristic listing task and the sorting task directly tested this hypothesis.
Characteristic listing. When counting the number
of characteristics listed for each item, all repetitions,
including synonyms, were excluded. The average number of characteristics that participants listed per item
on this task is a measure of their fluency in generating
unique aspects of these different members of the furniture category. The multiple regression analysis on this
fluency measure revealed a borderline significant effect
of regulatory focus, F(1,117) 5 3.7, p , .06. As predicted,
participants in the promotion focus condition displayed
more fluency (M 5 10.0) than participants in the prevention focus condition (M 5 9.0). No other effects were
significant. As another indicator of characteristic listing style, the average number of times a subject repeated terms or words when describing more than one
item was calculated. The number of possible repetitions
for any specific term varied from 2 to 8. A multiple
regression analysis on the mean number of term repetitions across all items (controlling for fluency) revealed

125

a borderline significant effect of regulatory focus,
F(1,116) 5 3.7, p , .06. As predicted, participants in
the prevention focus condition had higher repetition
scores (M 5 2.8) than participants in promotion focus
condition (M 5 2.5). There were no other significant effects.
Sorting. The first measure was the total number of
subgroups that participants generated in both the fruit
and vegetable sortings together. There was no time
limit on the sorting task and participants varied in
how much time they spent. Although the conditions
themselves did not differ in time spent sorting, time
spent was included as a covariate in the analysis. Multiple regression on this measure of total number of subgroups generated revealed both a borderline significant
effect of regulatory focus, F(1,117) 5 3.2, p , .07, and
a significant effect of valence, F(1,117) 5 4.4, p , .05. As
predicted, participants in the promotion focus condition
sorted the items into more subgroups (M 5 6.3) than
participants in the prevention focus condition (M 5
5.7). In addition, participants in the positive valence
condition produced more subgroups (M 5 6.4) than participants in the negative valence condition (M 5 5.7).
There were no other significant effects.
The two main effects meant that participants in the
Prevention Not Working condition produced an especially low number of subgroups (M 5 5.5), whereas
participants in the Promotion Working condition produced an especially high number of subgroups (M 5
6.7). One possible explanation for this difference is that
participants in these conditions selected different categories that naturally varied in their subgrouping potential, such as the category “Has seeds [Yes; No]” versus
“color” [green, red, yellow, etc.]. A review of the categories selected in the different conditions indicated that
this was not the case. Instead, the difference was due
more to participants in the Prevention Not Working
condition employing the strategy of choosing one subgroup, “X,” as a reference point and creating the two
subgroups, “X” and “not X.” For example, a participant
might choose to sort vegetables into “green” and “not
green”.
To eliminate any possibility that differences in subgroup production was due to choice of category for
grouping, an analysis was performed on just the number of subgroups used when sorting vegetables by
“color.” The category of “color” was selected because it
was the most frequently employed category for sorting
both fruits and vegetables, and the analysis was performed on vegetables because color was more frequently
used in sorting vegetables than in sorting fruit. The
framing conditions did not differ in how often participants used color as their sorting category. The logistic

<-----Page 9----->126

CROWE AND HIGGINS

regression analysis revealed a significant effect of regulatory focus, Wald 5 5.2, p 5 .02. As expected, participants in the prevention focus condition were more likely
to use an “X”/not “X” color sorting strategy (58%) than
participants in the promotion focus condition (41%).
There were no other significant effects.
Most of the criteria that were employed by participants in the sorting task, such as “color,” “size,” or
“taste,” could have been used to sort both the fruits and
the vegetables listed. Some criteria, such as “citrus/
noncitrus” for fruits, could be applied to only one list.
The participants were given no instructions regarding
whether or not they could repeat the criterion employed
for sorting the fruits when sorting the vegetables, and
it was certainly correct to do so. A logistic regression
analysis on repeating the sorting category with vegetables that had been previously used with fruits (controlling for the number of subgroups produced) revealed
a significant effect of regulatory focus, Wald 5 5.8,
p , .02. As expected, the participants in the prevention
focus condition were more likely to repeat their sorting
criteria with both fruits and vegetables (28%) than participants in the promotion focus condition (14%). There
were no other significant effects.
After the participants had sorted both the set of fruits
and then the set of vegetables, they were asked to list
as many additional criteria or dimensions as they could
think of for sorting the same set of vegetables (i.e., excluding the criteria they had just employed when sorting
the vegetables.) A regression analysis of the number of
different sorting criteria participants produced (controlling for time spent) revealed a borderline significant effect of regulatory focus, F(1,116) 5 3.0, p , .09. As expected, the participants in the promotion focus condition
produced more different sorting criteria (M 5 8.7) than
participants in the prevention focus condition (M 5 7.6).
There were no other significant effects.
Mood
One possible way that the different framing conditions might influence performance was that they could
influence the participants’ mood and their mood could
influence their performance. Although this might be
interesting in its own right, we were more interested
in the strategic effects of our framing variables, independent of any mood effects. Thus, we needed both to
check for and control for mood effects.
There were three emotions each for cheerfulness, dejection, quiescence, and agitation as the four general
types of emotion. Thus, because each scale measuring
current feelings was from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very), each
of these four general types of emotion had a total score
that ranged from 0 to 12, with 6 being the midpoint of

the scale. At each of the three measurement times, both
the dejection-related and agitation-related emotions
had scores below 3.5, i.e., slightly dejected and slightly
agitated. At each of the three measurement times, both
the cheerfulness-related and the quiescence-related
emotions had scores above 5.5, i.e., moderately cheerful
and moderately quiescent.
A repeated measures analysis by framing condition
was conducted for each mood type across the three measurement times. There were no significant mood effects
as a function of framing condition. Equally important,
each of the significant findings reported earlier on the
different task measures remained significant when the
four types of emotions at the different measurement
times, and the changes in emotions between measurement times, were included in the regression analyses.
The results of Study 1 provide support for the hypothesized difference in strategic inclinations between individuals in a promotion focus and individuals in a prevention focus. We had proposed earlier that the
promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and insure
against errors of omission, whereas the prevention focus inclination is to insure correct rejections and insure
against errors of commission. One implication of this
difference was that promotion focus individuals should
be eager to find “hits” and insure against omitting any
possible “hits”, whereas prevention focus individuals
should be vigilant against mistakes and insure against
committing the error of producing them. Thus, when a
task becomes difficult, individuals in a promotion focus
should perform better than individuals in a prevention
focus, and the latter should quit more readily. This
implication was supported by the results on the anagram task (participants in the promotion focus condition found more solutions for the solvable anagrams
than participants in the prevention focus condition following the difficult, unsolvable anagram), the results
on the embedded figures task (more participants in the
prevention focus condition than in the promotion focus
condition quit the difficult figure), and the results on the
counting backwards task (participants in the promotion
focus condition were faster than participants in the
prevention focus condition on the more difficult second
trial but not on the easier first trial). We believe that
these results for the three tasks taken together provide
strong support for the first implication.
Another implication of the proposed difference in
strategic inclinations was that, given a task where generating any number of alternative categories is acceptable, individuals in a vigilant state from a prevention
focus should tend to be relatively repetitive and generate few alternatives in order to avoid errors of commission, whereas individuals in an eager state from a promotion focus want to accomplish “hits” and thus should

<-----Page 10----->127

REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

be inclined to generate more alternatives. This implication was supported by the results on the character listing task (participants in the promotion focus condition
were more fluent in generating alternatives than participants in the prevention focus condition, and, independent of this effect, participants in the prevention focus
condition repeated terms or words more across items
than participants in the promotion focus condition), and
the results on the sorting task (participants in the promotion focus condition generated more subgroups than
participants in the prevention focus condition, with the
latter being much more likely to use a simple “X”/not
“X” sorting strategy, and, independent of the number
of subgroups generated, participants in the prevention
focus condition were more likely than participants in
the promotion focus condition to repeat their sorting
strategy across object categories). We believe that these
results taken together provide strong support for the
second implication.
In sum, the results of Study 1 support our proposal
that individuals in an eager state from a promotion
focus are inclined to insure hits and insure against
errors of omission, whereas individuals in a vigilant
state from a prevention focus are inclined to insure
correct rejections and insure against errors of commission. This proposed difference in strategic inclinations
was inspired by a signal detection analysis (e.g., Tanner & Swets, 1954; see also Trope & Liberman, 1996).
It would be useful, then, to use a signal detection task
to test more directly the hypothesized differences in
strategic inclinations or response biases. A recognition
memory task was selected for our second study to accomplish this aim.
Study 2 used the same basic paradigm as Study 1.
Undergraduate participants filled out a questionnaire
where they expressed their liking for different kinds of
activities during a large survey held weeks before the
experiment. Each participant’s responses were used idiographically to select one activity that the participant
clearly liked and another he or she clearly disliked.
When the participants arrived for the study, they were
told that they would first perform a recognition memory
task and then would be assigned a second task. The
liked and the disliked activity previously selected were
each described as an alternative second task.
The recognition memory task is a signal detection
task that requires participants to make decisions. In
signal detection tasks, a signal is either presented or
not presented, and a respondent says either “yes” (they
detected a signal) or “no” (no signal was detected). There
are four possible outcomes for a signal detection trial:
(a) a “Hit”—saying “yes” when a signal was presented;
(b) a “Miss”—saying “no” when a signal was presented;
(c) a “False Alarm”—saying “yes” when there was no

signal; and (d) a “Correct Rejection”—saying “no” when
there was no signal. The decisional criterion employed
by a person is assumed to depend upon the weights
or payoffs that the person assigns to these possible
outcomes. If the gain for getting a Hit is greater than the
gain for a Correct Rejection and the cost for “Missing” a
signal is greater than the cost of getting a False Alarm,
then the person will be inclined (or have a bias) to
say “yes.” In contrast, if the gain for getting a Correct
Rejection is greater than the gain for a Hit and the cost
for getting a False Alarm is greater than the cost of
Missing a signal, then the person will be inclined (or
have a bias) to say “no.”
Signal detection theory per se is silent on motivational determinants of a person’s payoff matrix. The
principle of regulatory focus, however, does make a prediction. Participants with a promotion focus are in a
state of eagerness. This state should induce advancement tactics, an inclination to approach accomplishments. They want to insure hits and insure against
errors of omission. These participants, then, should
want to insure Hits (successfully recognizing a true
target) and insure against Misses (omitting a true target). That is, these participants should try to recognize
as many items as possible, producing an inclination to
say “yes” (i.e., a risky bias).
In contrast, participants with a prevention focus are
in a state of vigilance. This state should induce precautionary tactics, an inclination to avoid mistakes. They
want to insure correct rejections and insure against
errors of commission. These participants, then, should
want to insure Correct Rejections (i.e., successfully
avoiding a false distractor) and insure against False
Alarms (failing to avoid a false distractor). That is,
these participants should try not to commit mistakes,
producing an inclination to say “no” (i.e., a conservative
bias). In addition, because of their vigilance against
errors of commission, these individuals should take
more time to respond. Thus, we also predicted that the
response latencies would be longer for participants in
the prevention focus condition than those in the promotion focus condition.
STUDY 2
Method

Participants
Columbia University undergraduates were paid to
complete a battery of questionnaires. Of those who had
appropriately filled out the critical questionnaires for
the study, 65 were randomly selected and scheduled to
participate as paid subjects in the experiment that took
place approximately 1 month after the battery. There

<-----Page 11----->128

CROWE AND HIGGINS

were 13 participants randomly assigned to each of the
five framing conditions.
Materials
The Task Rating Questionnaire, Selves Questionnaire, and Mood Questionnaire were the same as those
used in Study 1. The recognition memory task that was
used was part of a software system developed by Eugene
Galanter at Columbia University. It was developed for
the Macintosh computer and was designed to allow undergraduate psychology students to run their own experiments. No modifications of the software were necessary in order to use it in this experiment. The program
itself randomly generated the nonsense words used to
assess subjects’ recognition memory.
Procedure
The initial procedure when participants arrived at
the experimental session was basically the same as in
Study 1. The participants were told that their mood
would be measured during the session to correct for any
possible influence it might have on their performance.
After completing the first Mood Questionnaire, the participants were told that they would first perform an
initial recognition memory task [the experimental tasks
described above] and then they would be assigned a
second, final task. The participants’ earlier idiographic
responses to the Task Rating Questionnaire were used
to select one liked activity and one disliked activity.
The liked activity (e.g., playing a video game) and the
disliked activity (e.g., proofreading) were each fully described as an alternative second task that a participant
might perform. Props related to a participant’s alternative second task were again included, and the debriefing
at the end of the experimental session indicated that
the participants believed that they would perform one
of these tasks during the session.
As in Study 1, four of the experimental framing conditions were contingency conditions in which participants
were told that which of the alternative final tasks they
would work on at the end of the session depended on
their performance on the initial recognition memory
task. The relation between the initial memory task and
the second, final task was described as contingent for
everyone, but the framing varied in different conditions
as a function of both regulatory focus and valence. All
the participants were told that they would first be given
a word recognition memory task. The instructions then
varied across conditions, as follows:
(a) Promotion Working—“If you do well on the word
recognition memory task, you will get to do the [participant’s liked task] instead of the other task.”
(b) Promotion Not Working—“If you don’t do well

on the word recognition memory task, you won’t get to
do the [participant’s liked task] but will have to do the
other task instead.”
(c) Prevention Working—“As long as you don’t do
poorly on the word recognition memory task, you won’t
have to do the [participant’s disliked task] and will do
the other task instead.”
(d) Prevention Not Working—“If you do poorly on
the word recognition memory task, you will have to do
the [participant’s disliked task] instead of the other
task.”
In addition to these four contingent framing conditions, there was also the experimental noncontingent
framing condition. As in Study 1, the relation between
the initial recognition memory task and the second,
final task was described as noncontingent. The two alternative final tasks were described and the participants were told that one of these tasks would be randomly assigned to them after they had completed the
recognition memory task.
For the recognition memory task, the participants
completed three trials. (The computer program automatically combined the results for the three trials.) In
the first part of each trial, they were shown 20 nonsense
words, one at a time for 2 s. Each nonsense word consisted of five letters in which the first, third, and fifth
letters were consonants and the second and fourth letters were vowels. The participants then performed a
vowel–consonant filler task in which they identified
letters as either vowels or consonants for 20 s. Next,
they were shown another set of 40 nonsense words and
asked whether or not they had seen them before. Of
these 40 nonsense words, 20 were nonsense words that
they had seen before in the trial, and the other 20 were
new nonsense words that they had not seen in the trial
(or in any earlier trial). Participants first ran through
a practice trial. After the practice trial, they performed
the three consecutive experimental trials, with a pause
of 30 s between each. There was no time limit for the
last recognition phase of the trial. The experimenter
recorded the duration of this recognition phase for each
trial. After all the trials were completed, the participants filled out the Mood Questionnaire for a second
and final time.
Results and Discussion

Methods of Analysis
As in Study 1, multiple regression analyses were performed on the dependent variables to assess the independent effects of each framing variable while controlling for all the other variables.

<-----Page 12----->REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

Response Bias
The statistics for signal detection parameters are
based on the standardized frequency distributions of
the “noise” alone distribution and the “signal plus noise”
distribution, plus the location of a person’s decision criterion in relation to these two distributions. This criterion line, which is also in standard scores, is referenced
with respect to the noise distribution (Galanter, 1994,
p. 142). For this study, the response bias statistic beta
(b), which is based on the criterion statistic, was used
to represent each participants’s decision criterion point
for giving a “yes” or “no” answer. Beta is calculated
by taking the ordinate value of the signal plus noise
distribution at the criterion line (indicating the proportion of Hits) and dividing it by the ordinate value of
the noise distribution at the criterion line (indicating
the proportion of False Alarms) [b 5 f(H)/f(FA), where
f is the height of the ordinate, also known as the density
function]. A beta value of 1 indicates no bias, whereas
beta . 1 indicates a bias toward saying “no” and beta
, 1 indicates a bias toward saying “yes”.
A regression analysis on the beta values revealed a
significant effect of regulatory focus, F(1,60) 5 6.9,
p 5 .01. As predicted, participants in the promotion
focus condition had a risky bias to say “yes” as indicated
in scores lower than one (M 5 0.92), and participants
in the prevention focus condition had a conservative
bias to say “no” as indicated by scores greater than one
(M 5 1.13). There were no other significant effects.
Response Latency
The response latency of each participant was the
number of seconds waited on average before saying
“yes” or “no” to a presented nonsense word. A regression
analysis on the response latencies revealed a significant
effect of regulatory focus, F(1,60) 5 6.2, p , .02, reflecting the fact that, as predicted, participants in the
prevention focus condition waited longer on average to
respond (M 5 1.40 s) than participants in the promotion
focus condition (M 5 1.23 s). Response latency was
uncorrelated with beta in this study, but to make certain
the two were independent the multiple regression was
repeated with beta included as a covariate. The effect
of regulatory focus remained significant. There were no
other significant effects.
Recognition Accuracy
The participants’ recognition memory accuracy is
their accuracy rate in detecting the presence and absence of signals, a standardized score known as d8
(“d prime”). This measure was calculated with reference
to the two distributions of noise alone and signal plus
noise. The d8 measure is the distance in standard scores

129

between the two distributions, and is calculated using
the formula, d8 5 Z(FA) 2 Z(H) (i.e., the z-score for
False Alarms minus the z-score for Hits) (Galanter,
1994, pg. 141). A larger d8 value indicates greater sensitivity to the signals, or a greater ability to distinguish
between noise alone and signal plus noise.
A regression analysis on the accuracy scores revealed
a significant effect of valence, F(1,60) 5 4.6, p , .04,
reflecting the fact that participants in the negative valence condition had a higher recognition accuracy score
(M 5 1.58) than participants in the positive valence
condition (M 5 1.40). This effect was due mostly to the
very high recognition accuracy scores of participants in
the Prevention Not Working condition (M 5 1.72). This
condition differed significantly from all other conditions
combined (M 5 1.40), F(1,60) 5 4.4, p , .05), whereas
the other conditions did not differ significantly from
each other. The participants’ recognition accuracy
scores were not correlated with either their beta values
or their response times in this study, but to make certain
the accuracy scores were independent the multiple regression was repeated with beta and response time included as covariates. The effect of valence and the difference between Prevention Not Working and all the other
conditions combined remained significant. There were
no other significant effects.
Mood
As in Study 1, we were interested in the strategic
effects of our framing variables, independent of any
mood effects. Thus, we needed both to check for and
control for mood effects. Again, the four general types of
emotion were cheerfulness, dejection, quiescence, and
agitation, and each of these four general types of emotion had a total score that ranged from 0 to 12, with 6
being the midpoint of the scale. At each of the two
measurement times, both the dejection-related and agitation-related emotions had scores below 4.0 and mostly
below 3.0, i.e., slightly dejected and slightly agitated.
At each of the three measurement times, both the cheerfulness-related and the quiescence-related emotions
had scores above 5.0 and mostly above 6.0, i.e., moderately cheerful and moderately quiescent.
A repeated measures analysis by framing condition
was conducted for each mood type across the two measurement times. There were no significant mood effects
as a function of framing condition. Equally important,
each of the significant findings reported earlier remained significant when the four types of emotions at
the different measurement times, and the changes in

GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A promotion focus is concerned with advancement,
growth, and accomplishment and the strategic inclination is to make progress by approaching matches to the
desired end-state. In contrast, a prevention focus is
concerned with security, safety, responsibility and the
strategic inclination is to be prudent and precautionary
and avoid mismatches to the desired end-state. A promotion focus, then, would involve a state of eagerness
to attain advancement and gains whereas a prevention
focus would involve a state of vigilance to assure safety
and non-losses. Given these differences, we hypothesized that the promotion focus inclination is to insure
hits and insure against errors of omission, whereas the
prevention focus inclination is to insure correct rejections and insure against errors of commission.
This general hypothesis yielded three basic predictions. One prediction was that when individuals work
on a difficult task or have just experienced failure, those
in a promotion focus should be eager to find hits and
insure against omitting any possible hits, whereas
those in a prevention focus should be vigilant against
mistakes and insure against committing the error of
producing them. Under these circumstances, then, individuals in a promotion focus should perform better than
individuals in a prevention focus and the latter should
quit more readily.
Taken together, the results of Study 1 on the anagrams task, the embedded figures task, and the counting backwards task strongly support this prediction.
Participants in the promotion focus condition, compared to those in the prevention focus condition, found
more solutions on the anagram following their failure
on the unsolvable anagram, and counted backwards
more quickly on the difficult sequence. Participants in
the prevention focus, compared to those in the promotion focus, were more likely to quit the difficult embedded figure.
The second prediction was that when individuals
work on a task where generating any number of alternatives is correct, those in a prevention focus should
want to avoid errors of commission by sticking to as
few alternatives as possible and repeating ones already
used, and those in a promotion focus should want to
accomplish hits and insure against omitting possible
alternatives. Under these circumstances, then, individuals in a prevention focus should be more repetitive
than individuals in a promotion focus and the latter
should generate more distinct alternatives.
Taken together, the results of Study 1 on the characteristic listing task and the sorting task strongly support this prediction. Participants in the promotion condition, compared to those in the prevention focus

condition, were more fluent in generating unique characteristics of different members of a category, sorted
different members of a category into more subgroups,
and used a greater number of different sorting criteria
across categories. Participants in the prevention condition, compared to those in the promotion condition, repeated more characteristics across category members
(controlling for fluency) and repeated the same sorting
criteria more across categories (controlling for the number of subgroups produced in each category).
The third prediction was that when individuals work
on a signal detection task that requires them to decide
whether they did or did not detect a signal, those in a
promotion focus should want to insure hits and insure
against errors of omission by deciding that a signal was
presented, whereas those in a prevention focus should
want to insure correct rejections and insure against
errors of commission by deciding that a signal was not
presented. In a recognition memory task, then, individuals in a promotion focus should be inclined to recognize
as many items as possible and thus to respond “yes”
(a risky response bias), whereas individuals in a prevention focus should be inclined to try not to commit mistakes and thus to respond “no” (a conservative response
bias). Moreover, individuals in a prevention focus vigilant against errors of commission should take more
time to respond than individuals in a promotion focus
eager for hits. The results of Study 2 for response bias
and for response latency (controlling for response bias)
supported these predictions.
Another major objective of the present studies was
to examine for the first time how regulatory focus as
one motivational principle and valence or hedonic value
as a separate motivational principal influence strategic
inclinations, both independently and in combination.
Our studies considered this issue in the context of framing manipulations that created contingencies between
performance on the target tasks and assignment of a
final task. There were two alternative final tasks, one
liked and one disliked by each participant. The same
objective contingency was framed in relation to a positive or a negative outcome (valence) and, orthogonally,
in relation to a promotion or a prevention focus (regulatory focus). In addition, these contingent conditions
were compared to a noncontingent condition in which
the final task was randomly assigned, unrelated to previous performance.
As summarized earlier, regulatory focus framing had
many significant effects. In contrast, contingency had
only one significant effect and valence framing had just
two effects. The contingency effect was simply that on
the first trial of the counting backwards task, participants in the contingency condition counted more

<-----Page 14----->REGULATORY FOCUS AND STRATEGIC INCLINATIONS

quickly than participants in the noncontingency condition. This might have reflected greater motivation in
the contingency than the noncontingency condition, but
there was little evidence for this conclusion on the other
tasks. It should also be noted that the effects of valence
framing seemed to be driven by specific conditions that
involved regulatory focus as well. Specifically, the valence difference in producing subgroups on the sorting
task reflected mostly the fact that participants in the
Prevention Not Working condition produced an especially low number of subgroups whereas participants
in the Promotion Working condition produced an especially high number of subgroups. And the valence difference in recognition accuracy reflected mostly the fact
that participants in the Prevention Not Working condition had very high recognition accuracy scores. This
suggests that individuals focusing on prevention not
working might be especially vigilant under certain circumstances, and vigilance might be an advantage in
certain tasks such as recognition memory.
Overall, the present studies clearly indicate that regulatory focus, independent of valence, can influence
strategies or decision patterns in task performance and
problem-solving. The results support the general hypothesis that the promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and insure against errors of omission, whereas
the prevention focus inclination is to insure correct rejections and insure against errors of commission. Our
studies found that regulatory focus can be induced using a contingency framing manipulation. This manipulation was inspired by regulatory focus differences in
the messages that caretakers give to their children
when they respond to them contingently. But such contingency messages are not restricted to caretaker–child
interactions. As noted earlier, teacher–pupil and employer–employee interactions also communicate contingencies. More generally, organizations and institutions
communicate contingencies through the kinds of formal
incentives and feedback that they use. An interesting
question for future research is how different kinds of
formal incentives and feedback relate to regulatory focus and thereby influence motivation and performance.
