SUMMARY
upon the probability of three possible performance outcomes: (I) failure,
(2) marginal survival, or (3) high growth.
Four categories of initial human and financial capital are examined.
General human capital, represented here by the entrepreneur’s education, gender, and race, may
reflect the extent to which the entrepreneur has had the opportunity to develop relevant skills and
contacts. Management know-how, embodied in the entrepreneur or available through advisors or
partners, reflects management-specific skills and knowledge, without regard to the kind of business.
Industry-specific know-how reflects specific experience in similar businesses.Financial capital is one of
the most visible resources: it can create a buffer against random shocks and allow the pursuit of more
capital-intensive strategies, which are better protected from imitation.
The study utilizes a longitudinal study of IO53 new ventures, representative of all industry sectors
and geographical regions. The research departs from most previous studies in considering different
measures of performance (marginal survival and growth) and in considering explicitly whether the
factors contributing to marginal survival differ from those contributing to high growth.
It was found that measures of general human capital injluenced both survival and growth (except for
gender, with women-owned ventures being less likely to grow, but just as likely to survive). Management
know-how variables had more limited impact. Having parents who had owned a business contributed to
marginal survival, but not to growth. Number of partners contributed to growth but not to survival.
Management level, prior employment in non-projit organizations or not having been in the labor force,
and the use of professional advisors did twt have significant effects. Industry-specific know-how
contributed to both survival and growth. Amount of initial financial capital also contributed to both.

The usefulness of the model is enhanced by the fact that the resource variables considered are
relatively easy to assess and all can be considered at the time of start-up. Although some of the human
capital variables cannot easily be changed, the benefits or risks associated with each can be assessed.
In some cases,potential problems can be identified so that plans can be modified to improve prospects.
Overall it appears that, using a model based upon the initial human and financial capital of the
venture, it is possible to predict the perfomtance of new ventures with some degree of confidence.

INTRODUCTION
Whereas, in the aggregate, new firms appear to be a vital part of the economy (Birch 1987),
the prospects for any individual new firm are uncertain. The failure rate of new firms is high
(Shaper0 and Gigherano 1982) and many survivors achieve only marginal performance
(Reynolds 1987). What is needed by entrepreneurs,
their advisors, and those who might
commit resources to new ventures is a better understanding of the factors relating to survival
and growth. It would be particularly valuable if we could identify performance determinants
that are discernible prior to or at the point of start-up, rather than after significant capital has
been expended. These determinants may be based, in part, upon the initial resources of the
firm. In this study, the resources focused upon are the general background of the entrepreneur,
management
know-how, specific industry know-how, and financial capital. This study
examines the extent to which this initial resource profile can be used to predict the
probabilities of different performance outcomes. Three performance outcomes are identified:
(1) failure, (2) marginal survival, and (3) high growth.
If a framework can be developed to predict new venture performance before major
financial and other investments have been made, it can lead to substantial benefits for
entrepreneurs,
those who supply resources to them, and for researchers. It may permit
identification
of “high risk” or “high potential”
businesses
at an early stage. For
unpromising ventures, this assessment may help to prevent losses by suggesting caution,
more extensive preparation, and even abortion of venture plans. For businesses that appear to
have high growth prospects, it may provide encouragement.
A focus upon initial skill bases and other conditions observable at the birth of a venture
may be particularly appropriate, given the extent to which these factors impact how firms
evolve. Boeker emphasized that characteristics of founding can imprint an organization’s
strategy and thus influence its subsequent development. He quoted Kimberly who said, “just
as for a child, the conditions under which an organization is born and the course of its
development in infancy have important consequences for its later life” (Kimberly 1979;
Boeker 1989:490). Initial resources, including the know-how and capital that can be drawn
upon, bear upon the range of alternatives that can be considered by the entrepreneur. Thus,
initial resources influence strategies, which in turn bear upon the capabilities developed in the
young firm. Later competitive positions may be path-dependent, with firms that were unable
to pursue desirable early strategies, later finding themselves unable to match those that could
(David 1988).
Initial resources may act as a buffer against the liabilities of newness and smallness. New
ventures are engaged in a process of experimentation
whereby concepts are tested. The new
venture does not enjoy the benefits of well established
routines and administrative
procedures, clearly defined institutional
identity, market momentum, or credibility with
customers and suppliers (Stinchcombe 1965). The process of experimentation is characterized
by iterations of trial and error. Hence, the availability
of entrepreneurial
preparation,
knowledge bases, and financial capital at start-up may influence the venture’s ability to
withstand unfavorable shocks and undertake corrective actions.

<-----Page 2----->CAPITALAS PERFORMANCEPREDICTOR 373
Although we believe that the ability to predict performance outcomes at an early stage
holds many benefits, our focus does not imply that actions undertaken after start-up do not
bear upon venture performance. Whereas initial resources may predispose ventures to certain
paths or equip them with unequal abilities to meet challenges, they do not predetermine this
future. Clearly the subsequent unfolding of events, including key decisions, strategies and the
management practices of the entrepreneur, will shape the performance of the venture. Note
that the focus upon resources discernible before operations have commenced is an especially
severe test of whether or not venture performance can be predicted.
We should note that the predictive model specified and tested in this study does not
directly examine how particular human and financial capital resources drive performance.
Such demographic variables as entrepreneur’s education are clearly proxies for underlying
forces that may directly influence how a venture is set up and managed. Thus, again using
education as an example, we do not know what the individual had studied, how much was
learned or retained, or how relevant those studies were to the challenges confronted by the
entrepreneur. However, we do suggest that such variables as education may be useful proxies
for qualities such as commitment and problem-solving ability. This study does not examine
or model the underlying behavior of the entrepreneur. Our intended contribution focuses upon
the specification of a predictive model of venture performance that can be used with a high
degree of confidence, is generalizable across different types of start-ups, and draws upon data
that are easily accessible to the users of this model. To this end, extensive efforts were placed
on the research design of this study pertaining to sample selection and the methodologies that
were used for model estimation and testing.

Research on Predictors of Organizational

Performance

The examination of predictors of new venture performance has been one of the major streams
of entrepreneurship research to date. For instance, Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon (1992)
reviewed 63 studies that considered such relationships. Fundamental to research on predictors
of performance is the assumption that initial resources (including such intangibles as
entrepreneurial preparation and the fii’s knowledge base) will exert subsequent influence,
even though the environment and the firm may continue to change. Firms with stronger
resource positions are in a better position to survive environmental shocks and weather bad
decisions. Entrepreneurs with stronger preparation and those who can tap into the experience
of others are more likely to be able to deal with the problems that arise as their ventures
develop, problems that may not even have been foreseen at the time of founding.
Despite the growing body of empirical studies that address venture performance, there
is not a clear picture of how initial resources are related to subsequent performance. Findings
across studies are difficult to compare and often are inconsistent. (See reviews by Low and
MacMillan 1988 and Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992.) There are several possible causes
for this. First, there is the wide variation across samples-in venture age, industry sector, and
potential, As Gartner (1985) noted, differences among entrepreneurs and among their
ventures are as great as the variation between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs and
between new firms and established firms. Thus, it may not be surprising that there seems to
be little correspondence between the predictors of success for high-growth potential firms and
for “mom and pop” businesses.
Second, the lack of consistency across previous studies may also reflect the different
ways in which performance has been opcrationalizcd, including survival, profits, growth,

<-----Page 3----->374

A.C. COOPER ET AL.

absolute size, and subjective assessments. Although there are exceptions (Kalleberg and
Leicht 1991), little attention has been devoted to whether or not choice of performance
measure makes a difference.
A third problem relates to the analytical methods that have often been used. Earlier
studies often utilized cross-tabulations
or univariate analysis. It is only recently that much of
the research in this young field has utilized the multivariate methods that allow the impact of
different factors to be considered jointly.
A fourth problem of comparison arises because much previous research has included
variables that can only be observed after start-up. For example, VanderWerf’s model (1989)
incorporated factors such as decision-making
processes, organizational style, and entrepreneurial time allocation. Studies of predictors of performance for new ventures by Reynolds
(1987), Stuart and Abetti (1987), Sandberg and Hofer (1987), Romanelli (1989), and
Kalleberg and Leicht (1991) were in part based on actions or strategies adopted by ventures
after they were started. For these models, the predictive power of only the subset of initial
resources can be difficult to establish or separate from the other factors, given the likely
collinearity between initial conditions and future behavior.
The work by population ecologists, focusing upon populations of firms, has examined
influences upon firm survival. Much of this research has focused upon the impact of such firm
characteristics as age and size and such environmental
characteristics as population density
upon firm survival (Stinchcombe 1965; Carroll and Delacroix 1982). Initial resources have
only been examined to a limited degree (Bruderl 1992; Kimberly 1979), with some of this
work considering dimensions of strategy (Romanelli 1989). Much of the population ecology
stream does not cast light upon how firms that started at the same time or in similar
environmental settings may have different prospects for success.
The following discussion will review previous studies for the purpose of developing
expected theoretical relationships between particular sets of variables and performance. The
study seeks to address some of the specific concerns relating to previous research by: (1)
adopting a sampling procedure that controls for age of the venture while giving broad
representation to diverse industry sectors; (2) examining explicitly whether the performance
measure chosen makes a difference, in this case detennining whether variables contributing
to marginal survival are the same as those contributing to substantial growth; (3) using
appropriate multivariate
analytical methods; and (4) focusing upon variables that are
discernible only at the time of start-up.

INITIAL

HUMAN

AND FINANCIAL

CAPITAL

PREDICTORS

Four categories of initial human and financial capital are considered. Access to general human
capital, either in the form of the entrepreneur’s own education or as life experiences providing
access to general networks, may increase the problem-solving
ability of the firm. Examination
of general human capital also provides for more controlled evaluation of the effects of specific
types of know-how, management-specific
and industry-specific.
Availability of management
know-how (embodied in the entrepreneur or available through advisors or partners) may
affect the performance of the firm through more promising strategies or better management
methods. However, the value of management know-how depends on the suitability of this
generic management know-how to a specific industry. Availability of industry-specific
know-how can affect the performance of the venture by providing a tacit understanding of the
key success factors in an industry, specialized knowledge of the product or technologies, or

<-----Page 4----->CAPITAL

AS PERFORMANCE

PREDICTOR

375

accumulated goodwill with customers and/or suppliers. Finally, the availabitity of financial
capital can affect the performance of the venture by creating a buffer against random shocks
and by allowing the pursuit of more capital-intensive
strategies, which are better protected
from imitation.
In examining the attributes of the entrepreneur, the assumption is that for new, small
businesses, the firm is built around the entrepreneur. To the extent that venturing involves
extensive experimentation
and learning, it could be viewed as a process of interpretation
reflecting the idiosyncratic responses of the entrepreneur. Perrow (1970) cautioned against
psychological reductionism whereby organization outcomes are attributed to the actions of
single individuals. In the venturing context, however, outcomes cannot be understood without
explicit attention to the role of the founder. Without the benefit of operating history,
repositories of “hard” data, well-developed
scanning capabilities, or a large management
staff, the task of interpretation falls on the entrepreneur. He or she is most often solely
responsible for the process that gives meaning to data, identifies the range of alternatives,
determines actions, and carries these out.
Reflecting the central role of entrepreneurs, an extensive body of research has focused on
their strengths and weaknesses. In this regard, variables such as education, prior work
experience, and family background have often been used as proxies of capability. Similar
factors are also incorporated in our model. In the following review, we will provide an
overarching statement on each of the selected variables and comment on the consistency and
strength of support for each as a predictor of venture performance. We note that empirical
findings on the impact of these measures have been mixed and as such, we had to select
between competing explanations
when stating the directions of influence. For a more
extensive review of each study cited in the discussion, we refer the reader to treatises by
Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon
(1992), Vesper (1980), and Low and MacMillan (1988). In all
cases, we are hypothesizing that certain variables will contribute in a similar manner to both
the probabilities of marginal survival and of growth. This is because the existing theory is not
developed fully enough to predict a priori how particular initial resources might differentially
impact these separate performance outcomes.
Prior to the discussion of specific variables and corresponding hypotheses, we need to
turn our attention momentarily to the definition of performance. In this study, performance of
a venture is represented by one of three outcomes: failure, marginal survival, and growth.
The explicit and separate consideration of high growth firms parallels the research of
Birch (1987) and Reynolds (1987) who found that a relatively small percentage of new firms,
the “gazelles” in Birch’s terminology, account for much of the economic impact of new
ventures. Entrepreneurship
studies have typically used survival or some measure of growth as
the performance measure, without explicit examination of whether or not the measure used
makes a difference. Much of the new venture literature implicitly assumes that survival and
success both reflect the same underlying processes. Although that justification
may be
appealing, there is some evidence that different factors may play a role in survival than those
influencing other measures of success (Kalleberg and Leicht 1991; Carroll and Huo 1986).
The current choice of three performance categories is undertaken so that we may model
marginal survival and growth as separate processes.

General Background
The first class of initial resource is the availability of general human capital to the venture.
The performance of the venture may reflect the higher productivity, problem-solving
skills,

<-----Page 5----->376

A.C. COOPER ET AL.

and favorable access to networks associated with the general background of the entrepreneur.
Three factors are selected to reflect general background: level of education, minority status,
and gender. All of these attributes are, of course, quite general and do not represent specific
preparation for management responsibilities or for particular lines of business. Education may
be somewhat controllable by the individual, but minority status and gender are not. However,
all of these may serve as proxies for life experiences and access to networks and other
resources that bear upon the prospects for success of individual entrepreneurs.
Education
Education is one of the most widely studied entrepreneurial variables. Presumably education
is related to knowledge, skills, problem-solving ability, discipline, motivation, and
self-confidence. These may enable the entrepreneur to cope with problems and thereby be
more successful. However, it may be that more educated entrepreneurs perceive a higher
opportunity cost in staying with a marginal business. This could lead to a higher threshold
level of performance in order to stay with a venture and thus a negative or insignificant
relationship between education and survival (Cooper et al. 1992). Prior research has found
limited, although not uniform, support for the relationship between education and
performance. One literature review reported that 10 of 17 earlier studies had found positive
relationships between prior level of education and performance (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon
1992). No studies have reported negative relationships. In this study we hypothesize that level
of education is related positively to both probabilities of marginal survival and of growth.
Gender and Race
In regard to the demographic characteristics of gender and race, we might expect women and
minority entrepreneurs to have had fewer opportunities to develop relevant experience, to
have fewer contacts who can provide assistance, and to have greater difficulty in assembling
resources (Sexton and Robinson 1989). Prior findings pertaining to these two variables are
again mixed although they were more likely than not to corroborate the previous expectations.
For instance, it has been reported that ventures started by minorities were more likely than
others to generate lower earnings (Sexton and Robinson 1989). Findings on ventures headed
by female entrepreneurs have been mixed, with Sexton and Robinson (1989) reporting poorer
performance and Kalleberg and Ieicht (1991) finding that businesses headed by women were
not more likely to fail or perform poorly. We hypothesize that firms started by women and by
minorities will do less well.
The previous discussion pertaining to indicators of general background is summarized in
the following hypotheses:
HI: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth increase with levels of education.
H2: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are lower for female entrepreneurs.
H3: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are lower for minority entrepreneurs.

Management Know-How
Management know-how, embodied in the entrepreneur or available to the venture from other
sources, can be one of the central resources of a new venture. Knowledge of how to manage
a business enterprise is mostly tacit and is commonly acquired by substantial investment of

<-----Page 6----->CAPITAL AS PERFORMANCE PREDICTOR

377

time in observing, studying, and making business decisions. A new venture can increase its
chances of success by having this management know-how available through the involvement
of people that embody this tacit knowledge. Management know-how embodied in the
entrepreneur may result from having had parents who owned a business, from work
experience in a business organization (rather than a non-profit organization or not having been
in the labor force), and from previous management experience. In addition, management
know-how may be obtained through use of professional advisors or from involvement of
partners.
Parents Who Owned Businesses
A number of studies have noted that entrepreneurs are more likely to be from families in
which the parents owned a business. It has been reasoned that individuals growing up in such
families see parents as role models and that entrepreneurship is perceived as a viable career.
Furthermore, growing up in such families, a young person develops knowledge of what is
involved in running a business, a valuable background for future entrepreneurs (Duchesneau
and Gartner 1988). They may thus be more aware of the challenges they will face and be better
prepared and less disheartened when those problems arise. In this study, we hypothesize that
entrepreneurs coming from families where the parents owned a business should do better.
Non-Pro$t Organization
The organization where the entrepreneur was located just prior to starting a firm might be
viewed as an “incubator” where a number of valuable experiences take place (Cooper 1985).
In this setting the entrepreneur can develop contacts and learn relevant managerial and
technical skills. In terms of prior organization, entrepreneurs who have not been in the labor
force or who have left non-profit organizations may have had little opportunity to observe or
develop experiences directly relevant to managing a business. They would have had less
exposure to what is involved in running a business, thereby making it more difficult for them
to anticipate the nature and magnitude of potential challenges. Although the literature has not
yielded any empirical observations on this dimension, we hypothesize that entrepreneurs with
this background are less likely to do well.
Level of Management Experience
We would expect that level of prior management experience would be relevant, so that those
who had supervised managers or managed a business prior to launching the current venture
should do better. Their breadth of experience would better prepare them for the wide range of
problems confronting new ventures. Management experience may also provide the
opportunity to cultivate skills for monitoring diverse functions and interacting with different
constituents and to develop contacts with potential customers and suppliers. Similar to
education, management level may also serve as a proxy for greater motivation and aptitude for
solving problems. On the other hand, greater management experience may lead entrepreneurs
to perceive greater opportunity costs associated with marginal businesses. This could lead to
negative or insignificant relationships with survival. Prior studies are difficult to compare
because of differences in how management experience was operationalized. Empirical
findings have generally been mixed. Some have shown positive relationships (Teach et al.
1986) and others, no significant relationships to performance (Sandberg and Hofer 1987).

<-----Page 7----->378

AC. COOPERET AL.

Despite the inconsistency of prior findings, we hypothesize that level of management
experience would be positively related to performance.
Use of Professional

Advisors

Expertise can also become available through professional advisors such as lawyers, bankers,
and accountants. In general, access to information networks provides specific data and
encouragement, and also helps to identify blind spots. The act of seeking information may
also reflect more comprehensive planning, a higher degree of managerial sophistication, and
the start-up of larger, more promising ventures (Aldrich et al. 1987). Those who utilize
professional advisors may also have access to more financial resources. Reliance upon
different sources of professional assistance has been investigated in several studies. Use of
accountants has been associated with better performance (O’Neill and Duker 1986), and use
of outside advisors with greater success (Hay and Ross 1989). Time devoted to developing
networks and to non-customer external contacts has also been found to be related to
performance (Aldrich et al. 1987; Dollinger 1985). We hypothesize a positive relationship
between use of professional advisors and performance.
Partners
The presence of partners leads to a greater breadth and depth of expertise. Resource-

dependence theory suggests that partners can be viewed as means to add to the resource and
skill bases of the venture. Partners may also enhance the credibility of the venture to potential
lenders and other constituents (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven 1990; Teach et al. 1986). Both
the presence or absence of a team and the number of team members have been examined. Four
out of five previous studies (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon 1992) reported that firms started by
teams did better than those started by single founders. A number of studies examined the
number of principals and found evidence that larger teams did better.
Pertaining to management know-how, the following hypotheses are stated:
H4: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are higher for entrepreneurs whose
parents have owned a small business.
H5: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are lower for entrepreneurs who were
not in the workforce or who left non-profit institutions prior to starting the venture.
H6: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth increase with higher levels of
management experience.
H7: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are higher for ventures making greater
use of professional advisors.
H8: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are higher for ventures with partners.

Specific Industry Know-How
The third class of human capital considered here refers to the availability of know-how
specific to the industry or line of business of the venture. This know-how grows out of
previous experiences in the same or similar business, and ranges from tacit knowledge of the
products, processes, and technology to specific human capital investment in relationships and
goodwill with specific customers, suppliers, or stakeholders. This specific investment is
costly to build from scratch and cannot be transferred independently of the people in whom

<-----Page 8----->CAPITAL AS PERFORMANCE

PREDICTOR

379

it is embodied. The lack of this industry-specific
know-how is a major determinant of the
“liability of newness,” which presumably arises because of a lack of stable supplier and
customer relationships, inadequately developed internal processes, and problems in acquiring
resources (Stinchcombe 1965). Thus, entrepreneurs who come from similar businesses may
bring with them directly relevant knowledge bases, experiences, and relationships
that
significantly reduce the liability of newness.

Business Similarity
Entrepreneurs starting businesses closely related to what they did in the past would have
acquired repertoires of pertinent skills or the appropriate “prior mental programming” (Vesper
1980). Furthermore, such entrepreneurs are more likely to have developed networks of
relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. These would give them credibility and
enhance their ability to obtain credit, develop sales, and achieve other forms of cooperation. In
previous research, higher performance was found when the new venture was related in products
offered (in five of seven studies) and in markets served (in two of four studies) (Cooper and
Gimeno-Gascon
1992). Note that “business similarity” implies knowledge and capabilities
more specific to a particular market and task environment than that gained from having come
from a business organization, the previous variable considered. We hypothesize a positive
relationship between similarity to prior organization and performance.
H9: Probabilities

of marginal survival and growth are higher for ventures similar to the
previous organizations of the entrepreneur.

Financial Capital
The amount of capital raised should be positively associated with venture survival. There is
a long tradition of studying the financing of new firms, a part of the entrepreneurial
process
that is clearly central to the assembly of resources. The amount of initial capital is related to
the initial strategy that might be pursued. For instance, more initial capital permits a retail
store to carry a broader mix of merchandise or a high technology firm to undertake more
ambitious projects. More initial capital also buys time, while the entrepreneur learns or
overcomes problems. Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon
(1992) reported that, of eight prior studies
that examined relationships between initial capital and performance, six found that more
capital was associated with better performance. The hypothesis thus states:
HIO: Probabilities

of marginal survival and growth increase with the level of initial capital.

Control Variable: Industry Sector
In addition to the initial human and financial capital variables discussed previously, we also
consider industry sector to be a control variable. Previous studies of new firm performance
have found substantial
differences
by industry, with retail firms having the highest
discontinuance
rates (Reynolds 1987). Humphreys and McClung (1981) also suggested that
retail and service sectors may have lower success because of greater competition and higher
labor intensity characterizing such businesses. As such, we would expect new ventures in
retail and personal services to do less well. The final hypothesis states:
HI 1: Probabilities of marginal survival and growth are lower for ventures in the retail and
personal services sectors.

METHOD

Sample
The sample is a study of 2994 entrepreneurs and their firms tracked over a 3-year period. In
May 1985, approximately 13,000 questionnaires were distributed to members of the National
Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) who reported that they had recently become
business owners? Responses were obtained from 4814 entrepreneurs, of whom 2994 were
found to have become owners during the preceding 17 months. The study focuses upon these
the average
2994 entrepreneurs and their firms. 3 At the time of the first questionnaire,
entrepreneur had been in business for 11 months. The sample represented all industries and
all geographic areas of the United States. Although retail businesses and businesses in the
western United States seem slightly overrepresented, it appears to be broadly representative
of full-time new businesses in the United States.4
The reporting firms were sent follow-up questionnaires
in May 1986 and May 1987.
Multiple
venues were used to track the status of non-respondents.5
The surveys,
short-response
postcards, checks of NFIB membership lists, and post-office return mail
enabled us to determine for all but one of the 2994 ventures whether they had failed, been
sold, or survived during the study period.

i In cases when levels of the independent variables were compressed for analyses, sensitivity tests were
conducted to evaluate the impact of different operationalizations
on the results. All tests pertaining to the following
variables-education,
management level, and prior organization-yielded
no significant effects.
21he survey was initially field-tested with members of NFIB. Based upon 154 responses (from members who
completed questionnaires and made suggestions), several questions were reworded to provide greater clarity. The data
from the field-test were not pooled with those from this study.
3The decision was made to focus upon businesses which, on the average, were nearing completion of their first
yearof business. Such businesses were sufficiently well-established
to be well-represented in NFIB membership lists,
but were young enough so that founding characteristics would be fresh in the minds of the founders. With a cut-off
start-up date of January 1984 (I 7 months prior to the first questionnaire), there were 2994 firms in the sample (mean
age of 1 I months, with a range from I to I7 months). Sample characteristics
were examined to determine their
sensitivity to alternative cut-off points of 12 months, 17 months, and 22 months. Of the 11variables considered in this
analysis, only one (industry sector) showed sensitivity to the cut-off point using a confidence level of 0.01. The
proportion of new ventures in the services and retailing sectors did drop significantly as we included older ventures
in the sample.
4The sample was compared with a special tabulation run by the Bureau of the Census using data from the I982
Characteristics ofBusiness Owners. The tabulation included only those firms formed in 1980 through 1982 and
eliminated those with owners who worked in the business 20 hours per week or less and grossed less than $25,000
annually. (The 1982 CBO excluded corporations except for S corporations.) The sample was also compared with data
from the Sraristics of Income, 1985, published annually by the Internal Revenue Service and based upon income tax
filings. As many of these tax-paying entities are part-time activities, the sample data were compared with all
corporations, partnerships, and proprietorships annually grossing more than $25,000. The sample was also compared
with data from Dun’s Business Starts, 1984, which measures establishment openings, regardless of whether or not
they are independent businesses.
The detailed results of these comparisons are reported in Cooper, Dunkelberg, Woo, and Dennis (199ti64-67).
Based upon these comparisons, this sample appears to have a slight western geographic bias and a higher percentage
of retail firms. Overall, it seems broadly representative of new businesses in the United States.
5 Non-response firms were tracked in three ways. Those who failed to return the second-year survey were sent
a letter with an enclosed postcard to be returned, indicating whether they were still in business, were out of business,
or had sold their firms. Secondly, those for whom the post office was unable to deliver the letter with enclosed
postcard were classified as discontinued (failed). Finally, the NFIB membership records were used to classify the
remaining firms. A similar approach was used to determine the status of these firms as of May 1987.

For the firms that survived and also returned survey responses in the third year, growth
in the number of employees could be determined. After elimination of ventures for which
there were missing values pertaining to resource variables, the working sample was reduced
to 1053 for this study (385 failed firms and 668 surviving and reporting firms). Firms were
excluded when there were incomplete data on the independent variables or the growth rates
of surviving firms could not be determined because the third questionnaire was not retumed.6

two groups were compared in regard to the I I independent variables that are the focus of this research. Them were

Variables
In this study, performance is operationalized as a qualitative dependent variable with three
mutually exclusive categories: failure, marginal survival (survived with low growth), and
growth. Firms that were sold (4.5% of the original sample) were excluded from this study,
Some of the businesses may have been sold as they approached failure, whereas others may
have been flourishing. Because we were unable to draw these distinctions with the data
available, sold businesses were excluded from the analysis. Growth in employment was the
performance measure used. It has the advantage of being a measure of economic contribution,
and is usually not regarded as confidential information. It is not sensitive to decisions about
owner’s salary (as would be the case for profits), nor does it depend upon the owner’s ability
to estimate full-year performance in the middle of the year (as would be the case for annual
sales). A venture was placed in the growth category if it achieved at least 50% growth in
employment
as well as added at least two employees. Many combinations
of the two
dimensions (percentage and absolute growth in employment) were evaluated to test the effect
of alternative cut-off values. The chosen combination met two a priori requirements: (1) it was
not sensitive to initial size of the venture so that growth was not a function of size,7 and (2)
the combination demonstrated nominal validity so that the growth category incorporated only
those new ventures that had achieved substantial expansion. A firm was placed in the
marginal survival category if it did not discontinue and did not meet the criteria of the growth
category.

METHODOLOGY

AND FINDINGS

Given the qualitative nature of the dependent variable, two generic statistical approaches are
available: discriminant analysis and logistic regression. The latter was selected because it is
more robust to the violation of the normality assumption relating to categorical explanatory
variables (Maddala 1983). Specifically, we employed the multinomial logit model (MNL), an
extension of the common binary logit model when the dependent variable is represented by
more than two categories.
For each venture (n), performance (Y,) was represented by a set of three dummy
variables that captured the observed outcome of the venture. For each venture, only one of the
three dummy variables can be equal to 1. Y,is defined as follows:
Y,, = 1 if venture failed,

=

0 otherwise;

Y,, = 1 if venture survived but did not grow,
Y,, = 1 if venture grew,

for each respective outcome can be represented

as:

P”, = P [Y”, = 11,
P,, = P [Y,, = 11, and
P,

= P [Y”s = 11.

7 If the growth measure had been “percent growth in number of employees,” the model would have been
biased toward the smaller firms in the sample, with firms which initially had only one or two employees being much
more likely to show large percentage increases. If the growth measure had been “growth in absolute number of
employees,” the measure would have been biased toward firms that were initially larger. Hence. a combination of
both was used to minimize this bias.

<-----Page 12----->CAPITAL AS PERFORMANCE PREDICTOR

383

The summation of P,, P,,, and P,, equals 1. The MNL model determines these
probabilities
as a function of the observed independent
variables and their estimated
coefficients, according to the following equation:
P”i =

exp (‘,i)

i-f,

s, g

exp (V,r) + cxp (V,,) + exp (V,,)
where
V,, = a, + b,x,
V

= as + bsx,,
“s
V,, = 0 (Parameters of V,, (af and b,) are normalized

to zero so that a unique solution exists.)

The x’s represent the vector of explanatory variables denoting the initial conditions of
the venture. The vector coefficients of the MNL model represent the marginal effect of an
explanatory variable on the logarithm of the odds-ratio of that outcome to the normalized
outcome-failure.
As such, the coefficients in the MNL should be interpreted as describing
the effect of the explanatory variables on the probability of a particular outcome (marginal
survival or growth) relative to the probability of failure. The coefficients do not represent any
absolute effect on the probability of that outcome.8
Table 2 provides means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients for the
variables used in the models. Correlations between explanatory variables do not exceed an
absolute level of 0.26. Hence, multicollinearity
is not a problem in this study. The MNL
model was estimated by maximum likelihood using LIMDEP; results are given in Table 3.
Two vectors of coefficients (standard errors and corresponding significance) are reported
in Table 3. The vector b, represents incremental effects of the explanatory variables in the
prediction of marginal survival over the normalized outcome, failure. The second vector is
associated with the growth equation. Thus, we examine how each of the initial condition
variables contributes to predicting whether a venture will be in the marginal survival or
growth categories. Hypothesis testing was conducted by (1) examining
significance
of
individual parameters, and (2) evaluating goodness-of-fit of the full modeL9
A critical assumption of the MNL model is the property of independence of irrelevant
alternatives (IIA). Stated succinctly, the IIA property holds that the disturbances (representing
the unobserved factors that affect each of the three alternatives) are mutually independent
(Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985). Therefore, it is critical to test for significant violations of the
IIA property. For this purpose, the McFadden, lye, and Train (1976) test and the Small and
Hsiao (1985) test were used. Both tests showed that the property was not violated in this
study.

sThe absolute effect of a resource variable on a given outcome probability can be measured by the disaggregate
elasticity, which represents the responsiveness of a particular individual’s outcome probability to a change in the
value of the same resource variable. Disaggregate elasticities can then be averaged across individuals into aggregate
elasticities. Aggregate elasticities of the probabilities of failure, marginal survival, and growth with respect to all
resource variables are available from the authors.
9Because the sample included not only start-ups (63%). but also firms that had been purchased or inherited, it
was necessary to determine whether pooling these. firms together was appropriate. Separate models for “started”
versus “non-started”
firms were developed and compared; a likelihood ratio test showed that the samples could be
pooled at or below the a - 0.1 level of confidence.

of Individual Parameters

To assess the significance of the two vectors of coefficients (b, andb,), we used f-tests based
on asymptotic standard deviations generated through maximum likelihood estimation.‘o
Resources that were statistically significant for marginal survival (vector b,) included
education, minority status, parents who had started ventures, experience in similar business,
capital, and use of professional advisors (.I0 level). Contributing to growth were education
(.lO level), gender and minority status, experience in similar business, partners, capital, and
loThe use of asymptotic standard deviations can be problematic when the sample size is small. In order to
assess the validity of these asymptotic standard deviations and r-tests, a bootstrapping technique was used that draws
several subsamples from the original sample and uses them to approximate the real distribution of the coefficients
(Efkon 1979). Sixty bootstrap samples, each with 1053 observations, were generated. Bootstrap estimates of the
coefficients and their standard deviations were compared to their MLE counterparts. Although the bootstrap standard
deviations were in general larger than the MLE standard
deviations, differences were not large.

industry sector. Coefficient directions in both functions were consistent with predictions in
Table 1. The last column of Table 3 examines the differences between b, and b,. Except for
gender, number of partners and industry sector, no significant differences between the two
vectors were observed for all other variables. Hence, most resource variables appeared not to
demonstrate differential impacts on whether a venture marginally survived or grew.

Goodness-of-Fit

Tests

Significance of the model is usually measured with likelihood ratio tests calculated from
comparisons of the proposed model with “naive” models. With MNL, there are two naive
models (Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985): one assigns to each venture equal probabilities of
failure, survival, and growth, whereas the other assigns to each of the three outcomes,
probabilities equal to the actual observed proportions (in our sample, .3656, SOO5, and .I 339,
respectively). Based on the likelihood ratio tests, the x2 values from the comparisons of the
proposed model with the two naive models were 389.1 and 146.8 0, = .OOO). Hence the
current model was significantly more powerful than both naive models.
Having established the statistical significance of the model, the next step is to assess the
model’s predictive power. The evaluation of that predictive power is hindered by two
characteristics of the model. First, the initial probabilities of the outcomes are quite dissimilar,
with low probabilities for some outcomes and higher probabilities for others. Despite the high
rates of failure, sample outcomes are still dominated by businesses that marginally survived.
In this study, the proportions of firms that failed, marginally survived, and grew substantially
were 0.3656, 0.5005, and 0.1339 respectively. The challenge for modeling is that a simple
rule of assigning all ventures to the dominant category (marginally survived) would lead to
correct classification of 50.05% of the cases and exceed the performance of most empirical
models on entrepreneurial outcomes.
The second concern pertains specifically to the stochastic or highly random nature of the
entrepreneurial process. The twists and turns taken by organizations are to some degree shaped
by the occurrence of unexpected, nonrecurring or, otherwise termed, random events. The success
and survival of new ventures, relative to established firms, are even more significantly
dominated by these events. The thin resource base of the new venture makes it constrained in its
ability to respond to surprises. This lack of flexibility magnifies its vulnerability to events that
diminish market opportunities or increase competitive pressures. In addition, a venture pivots
around the founder as its key provider of skills, capital, interpretation, and direction. As such,
random events that enter into the life of the entrepreneur (such as health and family problems)
are also likely to affect the venture. Finally, considering that the new venture will operate in
uncharted waters, most of the events, even those indigenous to the structural environment, are
probably new, surprising, and unanticipated for that firm. The impact of these random events
renders it difficult to pinpoint the exact outcome for each individual venture.
These characteristics make our research similar to those studies in epidemiology that
attempt to find characteristics which predict the occurrence of a disease. In such cases, the
dominant proportion of the population does not contract the disease and hence naive
classification
rules based on assignment
of individuals
to the healthy category will
outperform most models. Secondly, even individuals who demonstrate all the characteristics
as specified by the model may or may not have the disease during the period of the study. In
such cases, the practice is not to specify the actual occurrence of an outcome but the
probability associated with the outcome. For example, predictions are made regarding the
probability of survival for such a patient within a certain period of time.

<-----Page 16----->CAPITAL AS PERFORMANCE PREDICTOR

387

We find the study of entrepreneurial ventures to be analogous to the modeling of these
problems in the field of epidemiology. Thus, we turn to the latter for the tests of predictive
power that accommodate the special characteristics of our model. One approach, known as
“deciles of risk” (Truett, Cornfield, and Kannell 1967), groups observations that have similar
estimated probabilities of occurrence of a disease. The procedure compares the estimated
probability with the actual proportion of occurrences within each subgroup. This approach
has several advantages: (1) it measures the fit of the model to the data much like in regression
analysis, rather than comparing predictions from two models, as in likelihood ratios; (2) it is
easy to assess the goodness-of-fit with the x2 test (Hosmer and Iemeshow 1989); and (3) it
can be put in graphic form, making its interpretation much easier.
For example, to calculate the test measures for the failure outcome, observations were
ranked by their estimated probabilities
of failure and placed in 30 groups with equal
membership. Thus, the first group was made up of those ventures that were least likely to fail,
based upon the model, and the 30th group was made up of those ventures with the highest
predicted probability of failure. For each group, we computed the estimated and actual
number of failures. A x2 test was then used to evaluate the tit between both series (Hosmer
and Lemeshow 1980). A similar procedure was used to evaluate the predictive power
associated with the other’two outcomes: marginal survival and growth. Table 4 illustrates,
through graphs, the actual and predicted probabilities for each outcome. The x2 tests between
the series indicate that equality between predicted probabilities and actual proportions cannot
be rejected at any common level of significance.
The probabilities
that the observed
differences between predicted and actual proportions were caused by random error, rather
than by real underlying differences, were 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99 for failure, survived, and
growth outcomes, respectively. This analysis shows that the model is able to predict, with a
high degree of accuracy, the probabilities of the three outcomes.
A further assessment of predictive power can be provided with the use of a holdout
sample. A subsample of 300 randomly selected observations was extracted from the sample,
and the model was estimated with the remaining 753 observations. From the results of this
reduced model we calculated probabilities of failure, survival, and growth for each holdout
observation. Predictive power of the model as applied to the holdout sample was assessed by
comparing the estimated number of outcomes in each category with the actual outcomes
(Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985). The estimated number of cases for each outcome was very
close to the actual number of cases (failure : 101.48 versus 111; survived : 156.13 versus 150;
and growth : 42.39 versus 39). Hence, we failed to find any significant differences between
the expected and observed numbers of cases of failure, marginal survival, and growth
(two-sided p-values of .2542, .4778, and .5620, respectively).

DISCUSSION

OF RESULTS

Using a model based upon the initial human and financial capital of the venture, it appears
possible to predict the performance of new businesses with some degree of confidence.
Moreover, we found survival and growth to be governed by similar stochastic processes, with
only a few variables demonstrating a strong differential impact. We believe this is one of the
first studies to examine explicitly whether or not there are such differences.
In terms of factors that contributed to the prediction of venture performance, all variables
that were statistically significant supported the directions of influence as specified in the
hypotheses.

General Background
Overall, performance appeared to be enhanced by level of education. A higher level of
education
may lead to problem-solving
skills and also reflect certain qualities of
“stick-to-it-ness”
through a combination
of commitment,
motivation,
and discipline.
Whereas such characteristics may merely lead the entrepreneur to hang on (despite poor
results), this study showed that beyond tenacity, there was a suggestion that education might
contribute. to both marginal survival and achieving high growth performance (significant only
at the .lO level).
Racial minority was linked to lower probabilities of both marginal survival and growth.
In addition to the factors considered in this study, it has been suggested that poor location and
limited access to the general market contribute to poorer performance for minority-owned
businesses (America 1980). We might also note that minorities may have fewer business
contacts and more difficulty in obtaining insurance, credit from suppliers, and access to
prosperous customers.
Gender was significant only in the growth equation. High growth is clearly a more
demanding process than marginal survival. The latter is as likely to reflect idiosyncratic
choices (e.g., personal attachment to the venture) as superior economic potential. This may be
particularly true when focusing upon the initial 3 years of the venture and not the later years,
when economic realities may play a stronger role. In contrast, high growth indicates a certain
ability to withstand the test of the market through effective choices and execution and also
requires the ability to finance that growth. There is some evidence that banks may impose
more stringent requirements on women business owners in regard to collateral for loans
(Riding and Swift 1990). Such requirements could be one factor limiting the growth of these
firms. It has also been reported that women owners are more likely to pursue other goals
beside the economic goals emphasized by many male-owned firms (Brush 1992). Male
entrepreneurs may be better positioned within networks and thus may benefit from improved
access to suppliers and customers. They may also be more likely to start growth-oriented
ventures.
Overall, the variables representing general human capital and background appear to be
significantly related, although in different degrees, to both marginal survival and growth. This
significance reinforces the general character of these variables. It appears that general human
capital is as well rewarded in self-employment
in new ventures (through higher rates of
survival and growth) as it is rewarded in other alternative uses (such as employment in
established firms). Similar significant findings of the effects of general human capital on new
venture success were reported by Bruderl et al. (1992) in their study of German new firms.

Management

Know-How

Having parents who had owned a business contributed to marginal survival, but not to growth.
The dynamics behind this finding are not clear. It could be that such a background prepares
the entrepreneurs to expect difficulties. As such, they may be less disheartened in the face of
unfavorable shocks. They may be more committed to venturing as a career path and may hang
on longer before seeking out other options. They may be satisfied with lifestyle businesses
that do not experience much growth. Although such role-modeling
may instill a certain
perspective and tenacity, it may not provide the industry-specific
skills and contacts
contributing to growth. It should be noted that this finding contrasts with the Bruderl et al.
(1990) study, which found that having a self-employed
father did not increase survival
prospects.

<-----Page 19----->390

A.C. COOPER ET AL.

The number of partners emerged as a significant contributor to achieving high growth.
Reiterating the reason cited earlier, high growth would be more difficult to attain and more
dependent on the availability of resources and know-how. Benefits associated with the
presence of partners include capital, functional expertise, and a broader range of management
experience. There may also be benefits from the psychological support they can provide each
other and from the lessened reliance upon a single entrepreneur’s drive and judgment. These
ventures are probably more sophisticated and larger in nature (Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg
1989). The formation of such a team may also subject the start-up process to more extensive
planning, evaluation, and refinement. Interestingly, the probability of marginal survival was
not increased, possibly reflecting the break-up of some partnerships because of disagreements. It has been noted that partnership team often do break up and that, when this happens,
the survival of the business may be threatened (Thurston 1986).
Three variables, all under the category of management know-how, did not contribute
significantly to either marginal survival or growth. They were: management level, prior
employment in non-profit organization/not
having been in the labor force, and use of
professional advisors (significant at the .10 level for marginal survival). The findings relating to
previous management level and use of professional advisors were surprising, although the latter
approached significance for firms achieving marginal survival. It may be that these variables
have their greatest impact on larger scale ventures than those studied here. The non-profit or
not-in-the-labor-force
background variable had not been investigated previously. It may be that
there are few advantages to be gained from simply having been in a business context, without
regard to the position held or the degree of relatedness to the new venture.
Overall, these results point toward the possibility that management know-how per se has
a weak direct effect on the performance of a new venture. Again, this agrees with the Bruderl
et al. (1992) findings that neither self-employment,
nor leadership experience, nor a
self-employed
father had a significant effect on the odds of survival. Two possible
explanations can be proposed. First, it may be that the only effect of management know-how
on venture performance comes from the enhanced ability of firms rich in management
know-how to raise initial financial capital for the business. Table 2 shows that higher initial
capital is associated with higher management know-how available to the firm (in the form of
management experience, use of professional advisors, and involvement of partners). Second,
management know-how acquired in an industry may not be generally transferable to other
industries or lines of businesses. In any case, the recurrent finding of the insignificant effect
of management know-how on venture performance raises important theoretical questions to
be explored by future research.

Specific Industry Know-How
Business similarity turned out to be a significant determinant of both marginal survival and
growth. The experience and contacts developed in a similar business may lessen the liability
of newness of the new venture, leading to less “trial and error” as the venture gets started. It
also represents a key resource for enhancing high growth.
These results substantiate the finding by Bruderl et al. (1992) of a strongly significant
effect of industry-specific
experience on venture survival. When considering these results
with the previous findings about management know-how, both Bruderl et al. (1992) and this
study find that industry-specific human capital is a strong predictor of future success, whereas
general management experience (defined as know-how in the role of managing a business,
independent of the industry of application) is weakly or not related to success.

<-----Page 20----->CAPITAL AS PERFORMANCE PREDICTOR

391

Financial Capital
The level of capitalization also contributed to marginal survival and growth. Capital may
influence performance through both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects include the
ability to buy time, undertake more ambitious strategies, change courses of actions, and meet
the financing demands imposed by growth. In terms of indirect effects, capital accumulation
may reflect better training and more extensive planning. Such ventures may also be more
promising propositions that passed the screening of lenders and investors.

Control Variable: Industry Sector
Industry sector was only significant in the growth equation. This variable is uniquely
important for attaining high growth. In this study, probability of growth tended to be higher
in businesses that were not in the retail and personal services sectors. This finding is
consistent both with our hypothesis and findings from earlier studies. Start-up barriers may be
lower in retail and personal services and these sectors may be characterized by more intense
competitive pressures. Along the same line, such businesses are less likely to possess unique
capabilities or contacts that render imitation difficult. In contrast, participation in industrial
businesses or professional
services may be highly dependent on very specific sets of
capabilities or requirements developed through prior experience or education.
In sum, of the set of hypotheses on venture performance, support is established for
education (H l), gender (H2), not being a racial minority (H3), parents who owned a business
(H4), number of partners (H8), experience in a similar field (H9), capital (HlO), and industry
sector (Hll).
It appears that groups such as minority entrepreneurs and female entrepreneurs do less
well. However, the use of multivariate methodology allows us to gain insight into the reasons
for these results. First, the weaker performance of these businesses is explained by other
variables incorporated in this study. Note in the correlation matrix (Table 2) that women are
more likely to come from non-profit organizations, less likely to start similar ventures, likely
to start with less capital, and more likely to be in retail or personal services. Note also that
minority founders in this sample were less likely to be male and to have had parents who
owned a business. Second, even after controlling for differences in know-how, capital, and
industry, the multivariate analysis shows that businesses headed by minorities and females
were still performing poorly. Although the results would suggest that there exists a direct
effect between gender, race, and performance, there is no established theory or consistent
prior empirical evidence to suggest that minorities and female entrepreneurs are inherently
less promising. It is possible that other factors not captured in our multivariate model, such as
access to networks or economic activity in the geographic markets served may he behind the
Iower performance outcomes. Much more research is needed in this area to identify the
unobserved factors that contribute to the less successful performance of minority and female
entrepreneurs.
Using the model to group ventures according to their predicted probabilities of failure,
survival, or growth, we found that within each group the actual proportions pertaining to these
outcomes corresponded
well to predictions.
In general, the model indicated higher
probabilities for failure and marginal survival than for substantial growth. Note that in Table
4C, even the most favored category of firms had only a predicted probability of growth of
36.5%.

CONTRIBUTIONS

AND LIMITATIONS

There are major practical implications
from this study. Accurate identification
of the
resources that contribute to survival and growth benefits entrepreneurs, those who assist,
train, and advise them and those who provide capital for their ventures. In no way do we imply
that the variables considered here are the only ones contributing to performance. However,
these resource variables are relatively easy to assess, and all can be considered at the time of
start-up. It is striking that this limited set of variables contributed substantially
to the
prediction of new venture outcome.
Some of the entrepreneurial capability variables cannot easily be changed. However, the
benefits or risks associated with them can be assessed, with implications both for individual
entrepreneurs and for public policy. Entrepreneurs whose resource base renders it less likely
for them to succeed should proceed with caution or strengthen their position. Venture size,
financial capital base, or lack of prior experience in business organizations
work to the
disadvantage
of female and minority entrepreneurs;
however, these problems can be
identified and actions to acquire specific know-how or capital can be taken to increase the
chances of success.
This study seeks to make a number of contributions
to the growing literature on
predictors of new venture performance. First, the model used in this study achieved a high
level of predictive power based solely on conditions observable at the start-up stage. Without
downplaying the significance of subsequent actions and developments, we believe that the
ability to evaluate the prospects of a new venture at an early stage presents a number of
advantages to both entrepreneurs and their supporters.
Second, many studies in the population ecology tradition have related survival to age and
size of the venture. This study, in contrast, examined a sample of new ventures that were all
relatively young and small. As such, the analysis focused on the identification
of other
determinants of performance. Hence, it shed light on factors that had not received much
attention in the population ecology studies-factors
which help to determine differences in
performance among firms that are all young and small.
Third, this study explicitly models the effect of considering multiple measures of
performance. It defined three categories of performance and used an estimation approach that
allowed potential differences in predictors among failure, marginal survival, and growth to
emerge. This approach enabled us to explicitly test rather than assume homogeneity and
identified the predictors that were particularly important for achieving growth.
Fourth, noting problems in the extant literature with data accuracy on performance
status, we took extreme care to obtain reliable data on this variable. Multiple venues were
used. These venues included the survey, postcards for easy responses, post-office return
information, and cross-checks with the NFIB membership database. As a result, we were able
to determine the performance status of each of the 1053 ventures. These efforts also allow us
to include all those ventures in the sample that failed within the period of study. Studies in the
past have been limited by a bias toward successful ventures due to the difficulty of tracking
businesses that have ceased operations. Performance was also monitored longitudinally
over
the first three years after launch, a period which is often characterized by turbulence as
reflected in rather high failure rates.
Fifth, this study also attempted to respond to the methodological shortcomings of prior
studies. Beyond the separate estimation of growth and marginal survival, this study utilized
the multinomial logit model, a more robust methodology for the estimation of qualitative
binary dependent variables. The fit of the model was assessed through multiple tests. These
included comparison with two naive models and use of a holdout sample for testing correct

classifications.
In addition, we also undertook a comparison of the actual proportions of
ventures in the categories of failure, marginal survival, and growth against the predicted
proportions through the “deciles of risk” approach.
Finally, the sample itself incorporated a broad array of all types of ventures. These
ventures were drawn from all industry sectors and geographical regions. Except for a larger
percentage of retail ventures, checks of this current sample against other large databases
suggest a high degree of representativeness
of the general population of small businesses. It
is possible that other cross-sectional
databases comprised largely of established ventures
reflect the lower survival rates among retail businesses. The breadth of businesses represented
in this study enable the findings to be generalized to the larger population of new ventures.
The rather narrow boundaries pertaining to geographic and industry settings of prior studies
were often cited as an impediment to integration among studies and systematic advancement
of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurship.
On the other hand, we need to note a number of limitations associated with this study.
Although the variables considered are similar to those utilized in much of the research to date,
it should be recognized that these do not measure the specific skills and behaviors that directly
influence performance.
For example, the entrepreneur’s
previous level of management
experience is considered, but the specific skills and behavior that may result from that
experience are not. The variables considered here do have the advantage of being visible and
relatively easy to assess by entrepreneurs and their advisors. However, future research can
move beyond these easily accessible variables to examine specific skills, behaviors, and
cognitive processes that theory suggests may be related to entrepreneurial
performance. In
addition, it should be recognized that directions of causality may be difficult to untangle. For
instance, greater initial capital may reflect more promising ventures, and professional advisor
utilization may be associated with more sophisticated entrepreneurs.
We should also note that this study focuses upon performance during the first three
years. It may be that some kinds of businesses (such as high technology firms) require a
longer period to demonstrate their possibilities.
It is also possible that other kinds of
businesses fail very quickly and are not even picked up in a study such as this.
Although the impact of initial resources on subsequent performance was extremely
strong, we did not observe the process by which initial conditions shaped the opportunity set
of the venture and its capacity to respond to various challenges. It seems likely that initial
resources serve to imprint initial strategies and also influence the paths by which capabilities
evolve. The process through which such strategies and capabilities developed was not
examined in this study.
In conclusion,
we believe that efforts to understand
predictors of new venture
performance constitute one of the most important streams of entrepreneurship
research. We
hope the success of the models described here, even with their obvious limitations, will
provide encouragement for the work yet to be done.
