Confirmatory Factor Analysis: For Applied Research is a well-written, timely, and
accessible description of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the many uses of this
statistical method. The intended audiences of this book are applied researchers and graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences. Several aspects of this book deserve
comment. First, most books in this area focus on either structural equation modeling
(SEM) or exploratory factor analysis (EFA), with little attention paid to CFA. Such
emphasis often results in inadequate coverage of CFA in most statistics textbooks. This
has been an unfortunate circumstance because researchers have had to rely on multiple
sources (books, book chapters, journal articles, technical reports) for a complete understanding of CFA. Second, it is my opinion that CFA is underutilized, particularly among
applied researchers who may not have access to all of the aforementioned resources.
Third, there is often some confusion about how and under which circumstances CFA
should be used, and this book does an excellent job comparing CFA and EFA and explaining how CFA fits into various research strategies such as scale development, construct
validity, SEM, and measurement equivalence. Brown’s book fills a very important gap
in this regard by integrating all technical literature and recent advances surrounding the
purpose, use, and interpretation of CFA into one source. As such, I was pleased to see a
book devoted to CFA, and it was with great enthusiasm that I accepted the invitation to
review it.
One of the primary strengths of this book is that Brown strikes a good balance between
providing the technical specifics of conducting CFA with theoretical and practical explanations making it more than just a ‘‘how-to’’ guide. By way of example, tracing rules are
presented through an inclusion of exactly how output values are generated in model-fitting
programs and what they mean, which serves as the delicate balance that I think applied
researchers will find attractive. In fact, there is ample guidance on developing, testing, and
interpreting CFA models (and computer-generated output) for all potential consumers of
CFA. In addition, Brown does a good job of pointing out the many ‘‘pitfalls’’ that one
could encounter in CFA and, where relevant, provides alternative suggestions. This is one
of the few statistical books that provide good integration of research methods and statistics. Indeed, Brown does an admirable job describing how CFA is used within several different research contexts such as scale development, assessing measurement equivalence,
testing group differences, and analyzing multitrait–multimethod matrices to establish
convergent and discriminant validity.
Another strength of the present book is the careful integration and comprehensive coverage of syntax programming and output interpretation of common model-fitting programs
including LISREL, PROC CALIS, Mplus, EQS, and Amos. Brown provides simple, wellorganized, and understandable syntax for each of the programs (provided in tables) and
carefully explains the purpose of each syntax command in the text and what output was
generated by the syntax. Another helpful feature of the text is related to explaining and
translating the different labels used by model-fitting programs (e.g., the squared factor

loadings are labeled ‘‘R-squared’’ in Mplus and EQS and labeled ‘‘squared multiple correlations’’ in LISREL). This level of integration of CFA model specifications with modelfitting programs should enable novice programmers to easily write programs to analyze
their own data. There is also a companion Web site that provides the data and computer
files used in the examples, complete with an up-to-date errata.
The book consists of 10 chapters. Chapters 1 through 5 cover the fundamentals, basic
procedures, and popular nomenclature of CFA. Chapters 6 through 10 describe more specialized or advanced uses of CFA. In chapters 1 and 2, Brown makes a strong case for the
importance of CFA in many applied situations by explaining the advantages of CFA and
distinguishing CFA from EFA. Chapter 3 provides a detailed explanation of the estimated
parameters, equations, identification, and estimation of CFA models. Chapter 4 provides a
brief summary of data-screening procedures, testing assumptions of maximum likelihood
(ML), and what to do about violations. The majority of chapter 3 is devoted to the different methods of model evaluation that are covered in nearly every textbook on SEM, but
they are nicely explained within the context of evaluating CFA models. Brown also provides advice on what information should be reported in a CFA study, but alas, the reality
is that editors and reviewers too often target this detailed presentation for the cutting room
floor! Together, chapters 3 and 4 serve as the ‘‘how-to’’ guide for conducting CFA and
this material lays the foundation for the remainder of the book.
Chapter 5 focuses on model misspecification and modification. This chapter (or any
source on model modification) has the potential to mislead readers into making post hoc
modifications that capitalize on chance. Brown offers some obligatory warnings about
post hoc modifications but proceeds to devote many more pages to conducting specification searches. This imbalance may encourage some researchers to engage in post hoc
model revision without consideration for potential downsides to such procedures. For
example, readers may infer that correlated errors may be allowed in a respecification
(based on modification indices) for reverse-worded items and other reasons that many
researchers would argue are not substantive reasons for a confirmatory analysis. A very
useful section in this chapter is how to deal with improper solutions and nonpositive definite matrices, as these can be quite vexing for students learning to use CFA.
Chapter 6 covers various applications of CFA for examining convergent and discriminant validity within the multitrait–multimethod (MTMM) framework. Chapter 7 walks the
reader through the different tests of measurement equivalence/invariance, equality constraints, multiple-groups analysis, and the analysis of mean structures. Although most of
the information in chapter 7 can be found in corresponding chapters from standard SEM
books, Brown’s chapter is far more detailed than treatments I have seen in other texts
(indeed, it is the longest chapter in the book). There seems to be some debate in the literature as to which tests of invariance (e.g., metric, scalar, uniqueness) are necessary to
establish measurement equivalence of scale scores between groups. Perhaps there is no
true answer or perhaps ‘‘it depends on what questions you ask,’’ but I would have liked to
see Brown give some attention to this issue (perhaps even recommendations?) given that
the establishment of measurement equivalence is a near-universal prerequisite for testing
group mean differences with latent variables.
In chapter 8, Brown covers a few other CFA models that will be quite useful to applied
researchers, such as conducting higher-order factor analysis, the correct estimation of

scale reliability, and issues in modeling formative indicators. Particularly helpful in this
chapter is the text on using CFA for estimating scale reliabilities that overcomes many of
the shortcomings of coefficient alpha, the more widely used estimate of (or proxy for)
reliability. Specifically, Brown provided a good summary of the recent work of Raykov
(2001, 2004) in estimating reliability and confidence intervals around this estimate.
Chapters 9 and 10 focus on data management and statistical power, respectively.
In chapter 9, Brown gives a brief summary of the various techniques for modeling with
missing data, with more detail on the generally recommended methods of direct ML and
multiple imputation (MI). Brown does not get bogged down in the detail of the ML and
MI estimators and frequently refers the reader to Allison (2002, 2003) and other citations
for technical details. Instead, his focus is on showing how to compute direct ML using
popular modeling programs. Particularly helpful in this chapter is a discussion of alternative estimators for nonnormal and categorical data, especially the use of the robust
ML procedure that is now available in many modeling programs. Chapter 10 provides
information that is almost nonexistent in most latent variable modeling books—how to
estimate sample size necessary to achieve adequate statistical power and parameter
precision.
Many students prefer a hands-on approach to learning and clearly written explanations
for complex statistical analyses as opposed to the algebra and formula proofs underlying
these analyses. As such, my impression is that this book fits this preference and could
easily be the centerpiece for a graduate-level course on factor analysis and/or psychometrics. It would also be a nice addition for a graduate course in research methods and
SEM. However, those instructors that prefer to teach statistics courses using matrix algebra would not likely use this book as a primary text. For the sake of comparison to other
texts, I found that Brown’s treatment of CFA was similar in prose, structure, and format to
Rex Kline’s (2005) SEM textbook, although Brown provided more example data sets and
computer program syntax than did Kline. Students will find the book very easy to read
and understand, and I anticipate that this text will serve as an excellent reference for more
advanced users of latent variable modeling. Indeed, his writing style is clear and engaging.
Brown provides more detailed information on procedures specific to CFA that cannot be
found in other texts. In addition, Brown introduces many concepts, such as scale reliability
estimation, modeling formative indicators, syntax programming and output interpretation
for specific model-fitting programs, modeling MTMM matrices, and analysis of mean
structures, which are either given only cursory treatment in SEM texts or can only be
found in journal articles. In my mind, it is these sections that will be most attractive to seasoned researchers and one of the reasons why I intend to use this text as a reference book
for my own research.
