Abstract
Home-based entrepreneurship, or operation of an independent income-generating business venture
based in or from a business owner’s place of principal residence (Roberts & Chrisman, 1997), is the
small business ownership choice of over 27 million full-time and part-time workers in the US (US Dept.
of Census, 2010), and Canada (Statistics Canada, 2006). This study compares entrepreneurial attitudes
toward perceived personal control of business outcomes, self-esteem and business growth in a random
sample of 544 home-based entrepreneurs, non-home-based (commercial) entrepreneurs and whitecollar employees in Alberta, Canada. One new attitudinal subscale was developed, tested and
validated. Significant findings were found for personal control, self esteem and preference for business
growth in revenue. Four significant predictors of non-home-based operation were identified, and the
mediating effects of organizational level variables over individual level variables on the relationship
between entrepreneurial attitude and behavior were noted. Data analysis included Anova, LOGIT
regression, and Lisrel Structural Equation Modeling.

<-----Page 1----->Introduction

For many entrepreneurs, a home business is a skill and experience building exercise and
potential incubator (Wehrell, 1995; Jurik, 1998) of a much higher potential, higher growth (Timmons,
1990) small business in terms of job creation, income generation, and perhaps eventual relocation of
the business beyond the confines of home. For others, a home business is simply an alternative to unor under-employment, a result of organizational and economic restructuring, and corporate downsizing
initiatives. Antecedent factors to home-based venture creation aside, the rise of home-based
entrepreneurship is representative of one of the most significant shifts in the economy since the
industrial revolution (Ireland & Webb, 2007).

Home-based entrepreneurship, or operation of an independent income-generating venture based
in or from a business owner’s place of principal residence (Roberts et al., 1995), is the small business
ownership choice of over 12% of the US workforce, or over 27 million entrepreneurs, an increase of 7%
in the number of home-based entrepreneurs in the US between 1999 and 2005 (US Dept. of Census,
2010). In Canada, the number of home-based businesses increased by 16.7% between 2000 and
2006, where a home business is operating in nearly 1.7 million homes or 14% of all Canadian
households. The growth of home-based entrepreneurship is supported by the number of self-employed
Canadians which has risen, on average, 5.9% per year since 1991 (Statistics Canada, 2006) and is
precipitated by macro-environmental factors such as changing societal values which place increased
emphasis on personal freedom, job flexibility and autonomy (Ali & Zeidan, 2007; Christensen, 1988;
Allen, 1983; Brabec, 1989; Plummer, 1989; Heck, Owen & Rowe, 1995; Walker & Webster, 2007),
advances in telecommunication and computing technology (Pratt, 1993; Bowman-Upton, 1993; Halal,
1996) and economic restructuring and corporate downsizing initiatives (Ali & Zeidan, 2007). Studies
also suggest that home-based work being performed is more likely full-time, and that income being
generated by home-based entrepreneurs is most likely the primary source of household income (Foster
& Orser, 1993; Walker & Webster, 2007).

Research suggests a host of antecedent factors which influence the decision to become an
entrepreneur and include individual, organizational, and environmental level determinants. Dobbs &
Hamilton’s (2007) and van Praag & Versloot’s (2007) reviews of small enterprise research citations
confirm individual-level characteristics as the main line of inquiry, although firm-level characteristics and
analysis could be considered a recent trend in entrepreneurship research. Investigation of individuallevel variables on new venture creation rates is appropriate for exploration of new populations of
interest, where three individual-level factors have consistently been associated as critical factors relating
to the decision to become an entrepreneur: 1) demographic (biodata), 2) human capital (education and

2

<-----Page 2----->experience) (Bates, 1995; Walker & Webster, 2007), and 3) psychological characteristics (personality
traits) (Bates, 1990a, 1990b; Begley, 1995; Herron & Robinson, Jr., 1993b; Miner, 1996) and are
recognized as significant elements of an overall model of entrepreneurship (Herron & Robinson, Jr.,
1993a; Gatewood, Shaver & Gartner, 1995; Walsh, Kirchoff & Boylan, 1996). This study is a response
to challenges for additional rigorous, empirical examination of the entrepreneur in general, and the
home-based entrepreneur in particular, in which psychological, demographic and human capital
variables form the basis of investigation.

The purpose of this study was to compare measures of attitudes of home-based entrepreneurs,
non-home-based (commercial) entrepreneurs and white collar, non-management workers toward three
psychological characteristics: personal control in business, perceived self-esteem in business, and
preference for business growth in revenue. The study combined use of a new psychological subscale
developed and tested for the present study to measure attitudes toward business growth in revenue,
with use of an existing entrepreneurial attitude instrument, the Entrepreneurial Attitude Orientation
(EAO) scale (Robinson, et al., 1991), a 75-item instrument based on a tripartite (multi-dimensional)
model of attitude and developed to discriminate between entrepreneurs and managers. Thus, the
fundamental research question this study addressed was:

Do attitudes distinguish home-based entrepreneurs from non-home-based entrepreneurs and from
white-collar, non-management workers?

Subordinate research questions included:

1.

Do attitudes distinguish full-time and part-time home-based entrepreneurs from non-homebased entrepreneurs and from white-collar, non-management workers?

2.

Do individual-level demographic and human capital characteristics of gender, age, life-cycle

stage, number of years of education, presence of technical, managerial or entrepreneurial experience in
similar and dissimilar industries, or presence of family business experience influence the association
between attitude measures and ownership of a home-based business or a non-home-based
(commercial) business?

3.

Do organizational-level characteristics of type of business, previous annual revenue, number of

employees, or number of years in business influence the association between attitude measures and
ownership of a home-based business or a non-home-based business?

<-----Page 3----->4.

Do significant differences in attitude measures exist within the home-based entrepreneur

subsample?
Although the extent of home business activity has been quantified at national and municipal
levels in North America, little is known about the individuals who operate these businesses or about
their goals and intentions for the future of their businesses (Ali & Zeidan, 2007; Walker & Webster,
2007; Jurik, 1998, Foster & Orser, 1993). Is the home enterprise likely to become a higher growth,
higher potential business, contributing to job creation mechanisms of the broader economy, or is the
home business simply income replacement for most people? This study contributes to the area of
inquiry in three ways: 1) theoretically, by providing a theory-testing approach to the study of homebased entrepreneurship, thus moving inquiry from the exploratory to the experimental; 2) conceptually,
by applying current attitude theory, the tripartite model of attitude involving a multi-dimensional concept
of attitude, to business owners and non-management workers; and 3) methodologically, by testing an
existing attitude instrument and by developing, validating and testing a new attitude subscale within the
same study. An understanding of the similarities or differences between home-based entrepreneurs
and non-home-based entrepreneurs will contribute to an understanding of micro-entrepreneurship and
growth intentions of home-based entrepreneurs; will provide valuable input into current public policy
decision-making processes regarding home business taxation, licensing, and permitting; as well as into
programs, services and education deliverables designed to foster and support home-based
entrepreneurship.

Theoretical Framework

Personal, situational and environmental factors are critical elements of the entrepreneurial
process (Greenberger & Sexton, 1988; Herron & Robinson, 1993b; Bygrave, 1993), but not all
individuals will choose to become entrepreneurs under similar demographic, situational or
environmental conditions. The creation of a new organization is 1) a process involving numerous
antecedent variables, 2) is initiated by an act of human volition and 3) is extremely sensitive to initial
conditions (Bygrave & Hofer, 1991). A more complete understanding of the entrepreneur and of the
entrepreneurial process will be gained by investigating psychological characteristics, primary forces of
human volition.

Within the domain of entrepreneurial behavior research, trait-based personality approaches
have formed the major line of inquiry, led early on by David McClelland (1961) (Robinson, 1987). This
approach suggests entrepreneurs possess a common personality type, where empirical focus has been
to enumerate a set of characteristics describing the entrepreneurial personality for the purpose of
distinguishing entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs (Gartner, 1988). Ireland & Webb (2007) present a

4

<-----Page 4----->cross-disciplinary review of entrepreneurship research where personality traits studied in
entrepreneurship research include: risk-taking, need for achievement (nAch) (McClelland, 1961);
ambition, strive for independence, responsibility, self-confidence (Davids, 1963); internal locus of control
(self-efficacy) (Borland, 1974); personal value orientation (Gassé, 1977); goal-orientation, creativity,
innovativeness (Timmons, 1978); energy, ambition, positive reaction to setbacks (Sexton, 1980); need
to control, responsibility seeking, risk taking (Welsh & White, 1983); and idea generation and empathy
(Miner, 2000).

While personality-trait based modes of inquiry have been fruitful, several studies suggest that
differentiating entrepreneurs from managers or entrepreneurs from the general population based on the
entrepreneur’s supposed possession of entrepreneurial traits is not possible (Brockhaus, 1980; Kent,
Sexton & Vesper, 1982). In a review of trait-based approaches to studying entrepreneurship, Robinson
et al. (1991) levy criticism at poor instrumentation, at use of broad-spectrum personality theories in a
specific domain such as entrepreneurship, and at the static, fixed and deterministic nature of personality
theories which do not account for the dynamic nature of entrepreneurship which calls instead for
interactive theories: models which are influenced by and influence the environment. Similarly, and
consistent with the criticism levied at personality trait models, demographic approaches explain very
little variance of human action, and therefore possess little predictive power, an established criteria for
the evaluation of social science research and theory. However, a fully-specified model of the
entrepreneurial process must include the entrepreneur (Mitchell and James, 1989).

The appropriate theoretical model for studying determinants of individual behavior has been a
point of controversy in psychology for over thirty years (Brockhaus, 1987; Gartner, 1988).
Investigations of entrepreneurial behavior have employed personality trait, psychoanalytic, socialcognitive (behavioristic or situational) and humanistic approaches. This study proposed a departure
from the two traditional approaches most commonly employed in the study of the entrepreneur,
personality and demographic models of entrepreneurial behaviour, to a model based on attitudes. It is
believed that an attitude approach overcomes deficiencies of static, deterministic models of
entrepreneurial behaviour with a dynamic, interactive and open-system approach (Mitchell & James,
1989).

Psychological Constructs
This study employed two constructs: self-esteem and personal control and investigated one additional
construct, intention toward business growth in revenue, believed to be a distinguishing characteristic of nonhome-based (commercial) entrepreneurship. Although these constructs are not meant to represent an
exhaustive set of characteristics associated with entrepreneurship, the first two characteristics are habitually

5

<-----Page 5----->cited in descriptions of the entrepreneur. Research has stressed need for a more comprehensive
understanding of an entrepreneur’s growth intentions related to revenue as a means of distinguishing types
of entrepreneurs (Wiklund et al., 1997; Lewis et al., 1997; Gartner et al., 1997; Hornaday & Bunker, 1970).
Thus, an investigation of these characteristics is not intended to override significance of other characteristics
and roles played in determining entrepreneurial behaviour, but it provides a starting point using an attitudebased approach to understanding the phenomenon. Three attitude subscales utilized in this study were:

1.

Perceived personal control of business outcomes, concerning an individual’s perception of control
and influence over his or her business.

2.

Perceived self-esteem in business, pertaining to self-confidence and perceived competency of an
individual in conjunction with his or her business affairs.

3.

Preference for business growth in revenue, referring to an individual’s perception of the
importance of revenue growth in their business.

Attitude Theory
Spurred largely by interest in the relationship between attitudes and behavior, the attitude
concept moved back into the focus of research in social psychology, and began to appear in the
entrepreneurship literature in the 1990’s (Robinson, et al., 1991; Christensen, 1994; Gassé, 1982;
Greenberger & Sexton, 1987; Carsrud & Johnson, 1989). It has been suggested that attitude theory,
specifically the tripartite model of attitude, be used as an alternative approach to personality trait and
characteristic approaches in investigations of entrepreneurial behavior (Robinson, 1987; Robinson, et
al., 1991; Gassé, 1982). An attitude approach to studying entrepreneurs holds several advantages:
Attitude theory rests on a substantial base of research in the broader social science literatures as well
as in certain streams of management literature, namely consumer behavior. Attitudes are seen as
being less stable than personality traits, changing across time and situation through interactive
processes with the environment (Triandis, 1971; Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960), thus attitudes are
dynamic. Attitude-based instruments account for more variance in behavior than do trait or
characteristic instruments (Ajzen, 1982; Ajzen & Madden, 1986). Potential benefits of an attitude
approach to understanding entrepreneurial behavior are twofold: first, that attitudes are dynamic; and
second, that standardized scale development techniques should increase the validity and reliability of
findings in the area. Thus, attitude theory offers both theoretical and practical benefits to the study of
entrepreneurship.

Tripartite Model of Attitude
Most definitions of attitude imply a relationship between attitude and behavior, and most often
present a uni-dimensional attitude construct. For example, Petty and Cacioppo (1981) suggest that an

6

<-----Page 6----->attitude is “a general and enduring positive and negative feeling about some person, object, or issue” (p.
31). This is an example of a uni-dimensional attitude construct comprised of an affective component
only, referring to a person’s evaluation of, or feelings toward, an attitude object (Thurstone, 1931).
Affective response measures would be comprised of statements relating to one’s feeling toward an
attitude object. A more complex view of attitude suggests that an attitude is comprised of three distinct
components: affective, cognitive and conative components which manifest as thoughts, feelings and
actions directed toward an attitude object. This multi-dimensional view of attitude is represented by the
tri-partite model of attitude, the model which formed the theoretical foundation for this study.

Early proponents of the tri-partite model argued that traditional physiological measures of
attitude (changes in pulse or breathing rates, eye movement, pupil dilation) are informative of only the
affective component of attitude (Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960: 3). The multi-dimensional view of the
attitude concept is superior to a uni-dimensional view due to its ability to measure not only feelings
toward an attitude object, but also beliefs and intended actions or behaviors toward the attitude object
(Triandis, 1971; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977). Until fairly recently, instruments used to measure
entrepreneurial tendencies have been based on personality models which lack application to
entrepreneurship and which lack sufficient attitude-object specificity, referring to the lack of restriction of
interpretation of an attitude to the level or domain from which the attitude is chosen, thereby lessening
precision of the instrument. The concept of attitude-object specificity is an important distinguishing
characteristic of instruments based on models of attitude over those of personality. The concept of
attitude-object specificity performs two important functions: 1) it limits generalization of attitudes to
behaviors related to the object of the attitude, and 2) it increases predictability because of the limited
scope of the instrument (Christensen, 1994; McGuire, 1985; Robinson, 1987).

Inconsistencies in the attitude-behavior relationship result from a failure to define the context in
which attitude objects are to be evaluated, or the attitude-object specificity (Greenwald, 1989). For
example, if the attitude object is a rose, a respondent might evaluate the rose in terms of its
appearance, fragrance or colour, its membership in the larger categories of flowers, or its purpose as a
symbol of love between two people, all of which will be quantitatively different. The issue of ambiguity in
interpretation of an attitude object is best dealt with by the principle of compatibility which posits that
consistency between two indicators of a given disposition is a function of the degree to which indicators
assess the disposition at the same level of generality or specificity. Thus, the more similar the action,
target, context, and time elements of a verbal response to an object (the attitude) to the elements of a
nonverbal response (the behavior), the stronger should be the statistical relation between the two
(Greenwald, 1989; Ajzen, 1989).

7

<-----Page 7----->The Entrepreneurial Attitude Orientation (EAO) Scale
Robinson, Stimpson, Huefner and Hunt (1991) developed the Entrepreneurial Attitude Orientation
(EAO) scale to test the hypothesis that attitude measures have higher discriminant validity than
personality trait-based measures or demographic measures in distinguishing entrepreneurs from nonentrepreneurs. The EAO is based on the tri-partite model of attitude and therefore captures affective,
cognitive and conative measures of attitudes toward entrepreneurship which were selected as the basis
of the EAO: 1) achievement in business, 2) innovation in business, 3) perceived personal control of
business outcomes, and 4) perceived self-esteem in business. The EAO scale was selected for use in
the present study because of rigorous subscale development and testing procedures and its predictive
power in distinguishing entrepreneurs from members of the general public (Robinson, 1987).

The stability of the EAO over time was assessed with test-retest correlations where each of the
four subscales achieved an acceptable level of reliability (n= 63 students, Achievement subscale r = .74;
Personal Control subscale r = .71; Self-esteem subscale r = .76; and Innovation subscale r = .85),
although the subscales varied in performance (Robinson et al., 1991). Internal consistency of the EAO
was assessed with item-total correlation of each attitude component and of each subscale to ensure unidimensionality. Cronbach’s alphas for each of the subscales were acceptable, where Achievement
subscale r = .84; Personal Control subscale r = .70; Self-esteem subscale r = .73; and Innovation
subscale r = .90. According to Hair et al. (1995), levels of .70 α are acceptable in early research, while
levels of .80 alpha indicate that the measure is attenuated by very little error.

Specification of the Model
Figure 1 illustrates affective (aff), cognitive (cog) and conative (con) measures of the three
psychological constructs investigated in this study. These three constructs converge to form an
entrepreneurial attitude orientation, represented as a constellation of attitudes toward personal control,
self-esteem and business growth in revenue. Of interest is the extent to which individual and
organizational level variables moderate the relationship between entrepreneurial attitude and
entrepreneurial behavior, expressed in the model as either home-based business ownership, nonhome-based business ownership or non-entrepreneurial behavior (white-collar, non-management
worker). Attitude objects are labeled to reflect appropriate levels of attitude-object specificity, i.e.
achievement motive is referred to as “achievement in business,” personal control is referred to as
“perceived personal control of business outcomes,” and so on.

Personal Control in Business
Although different approaches to instrumentation and measurement and to conceptualization of
personal control have been applied in studies of locus of control and entrepreneurs and comparative
studies of entrepreneurs and workers, the preponderance of literature suggests a relationship between a
desire for personal control, or belief that personal control exists, and entrepreneurship. Chay (1993)
cites significant differences in perceived locus of control among employees, self-employeds and
entrepreneurs, where entrepreneurs produce high scores (internal locus) and employees produce low
scores (external locus). Robinson, et al., 1991 reports significant differences in attitude toward personal
control between founders and non-founders.

To the extent that home-based business owners are entrepreneurial in behavior, this literature
would suggest that home-based business owners are more likely to produce higher preference for
personal control scores than white-collar employees. There is evidence, albeit anecdotal, which
suggests this may not be the case. Many home-based entrepreneurs “end up” running businesses out
of their homes, a result of corporate downsizing initiatives, job loss, retirement or personal choice.
Although no published empirical estimates of the proportion of home-based entrepreneurs who are
“pushed or pulled” into entrepreneurship were found, it is possible that a significant number of these
business owners have become entrepreneurs as a result of major organizational restructuring programs,
programs most likely beyond the control of these individuals. Thus, these individuals may perceive less

9

<-----Page 9----->control over business outcomes, having been subject to the emotional, psychological, and often financial
turmoil of employment layoff, than that perceived by non-home-based entrepreneurs, or currently
employed, white-collar workers. It is also posited that full-time business owners will perceive more
personal control of business outcomes than will part-time home-based entrepreneurs, due to nature of
and commitment to the operation of a full-time business. Based on the findings presented above, and
the reasoning behind differences among home-based business owners on perceived control over
business outcomes, the following hypotheses were proposed:

H1a.

Non-home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived control of

business outcomes than will home-based entrepreneurs, as measured by the EAO Personal Control
subscale.

H1b.

Non-home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived control of

business outcomes than will white-collar, non-management employees, as measured by the EAO
Personal Control subscale.

H1c.

White-collar, non-management employees will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived

control of business outcomes than will full-time home-based entrepreneurs, as measured by the EAO
Personal Control subscale.

H1d.

Full-time home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived

control of business outcomes than will part-time home-based entrepreneurs, as measured by the EAO
Personal Control subscale

Self-Esteem
Although the findings related to self-esteem of entrepreneurs are mixed, evidence in the
literature suggests that entrepreneurs possess high regard for their skills, talents and abilities, resulting
in strong measures of self-worth and self-esteem. Studies of “intending” or nascent entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurship students indicate higher self-esteem scores for intending entrepreneurs and for
entrepreneurship majors than for non-business majors (Sexton & Bowman, 1984; 1983). In addition,
significant differences in self-esteem were reported between founders and non-founders using the EAO
self-esteem subscale (Robinson et al., 1991). Case studies, however, suggest entrepreneurial behavior
is a manifestation of low self-esteem where, although individuals studied demonstrated achievement
motive and need to control, this behavior was seen as a result of poor senses of self (Kets de Vries,
1996). The hypotheses presented here reflect the generally held position that entrepreneurship is
related to higher levels of self-esteem in business:

10

<-----Page 10----->H2a.

Non-home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived self-

esteem in business than will home-based entrepreneurs, as measured by the EAO Self-esteem in
Business subscale.

H2b.

Non-home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived self-

esteem in business than will white-collar, non-management employees, as measured by the EAO Selfesteem in Business subscale.

H2c.

Full-time home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward perceived self-

esteem in business than will white-collar, non-management employees, as measured by the EAO Selfesteem in Business subscale.

Preference for Business Growth in Revenue
Multi-dimensional conceptualizations of the entrepreneur exist in the literature, which suggest
distinct types of entrepreneurial intention based on business growth motivations of founders of small
businesses (Timmons, 1990; Carland et al., 1984; Perry et al., 1985). Additionally, business growth is
emerging as a multi-dimensional construct, where growth can be viewed as occurring along financial
and managerial lines, or operationalized as small firm growth in revenue and in employment Birley &
Westhead, 1994; Westhead & Birley, 1995). One of the more common conceptualizations of
entrepreneurs is that proposed by Carland, et al. (1989), suggesting a distinction between entrepreneurs
and small business owners, where small business owners are unlikely to engage in any new marketing
or innovative practices. Alternatively, Carland, et al., suggest that entrepreneurs, by virtue of their focus
on increased growth and profits, would be more likely to pursue new avenues for the business than
would small business owners. Based on the literature, the following hypotheses related to preference for
business growth in revenue and type of entrepreneur were proposed:

H3a.

Non-home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward preference for

business growth in revenue than will home-based entrepreneurs, as measured by the Preference for
Business Growth in Revenue subscale.

H3b.

Full-time home-based entrepreneurs will demonstrate stronger attitudes toward preference for

business growth in revenue than will part-time home-based entrepreneurs, as measured by the
Preference for Business Growth in Revenue subscale.

Research Methods and Measures

11

<-----Page 11----->The instrument developed for this study was composed of the Entrepreneurial Attitude
Orientation (EAO) scale (Robinson, et al., 1991) and one subscale developed by the researcher for this
study: 1) Preference for business growth in revenue (RG) subscale. Development and testing of the
revenue attitudinal subscale is discussed in the following section. Careful attention was paid to
instrumentation and to potential sources of bias in this study.

Scale Item Development
In order to establish content validity, to assist the development of revenue scale item, and to
identify potential systemic differences between home-based and non-home-based entrepreneur’s
perceptions of business growth, a focus group was conducted with entrepreneurs. Six home-based and
five non-home-based entrepreneurs (four females and seven males), operating full-time businesses and
who were known to the researcher were asked to describe what the construct meant to them in the
context of business ownership. The two hour discussion was audio-taped, transcribed, and contentanalyzed for major themes relating to perceptions of revenue in business in general, and in their own
businesses. There were no apparent differences in meaning among home-based and non-home-based
entrepreneurs. In other words, growth in revenue, dimensions of growth, and effects of business growth
on the lives of owners were described similarly by both groups.

Thematic content which emerged from the focus group provided the foundation for development
of subscale items. Ten to fifteen items (statements) per attitude component (affective, cognitive and
conative) for each subscale were generated for a total of 40 test revenue subscale items. The 40 items
were edited and the revised scale items were administered to a panel of judges consisting of 51
volunteer undergraduate students enrolled in a small business management course at the University of
Calgary, Canada who, after a brief presentation on the tripartite model of attitude, were asked to identify
the attitude component each scale item represented (either affective, cognitive or conative). As unidimensionality of each attitude component is important in tripartite theory (Triandis, 1971), a standard of
.75 inter-rater reliability was used to evaluate the 40 items tested. Four items failed to pass the 75%
inter-rater agreement mark.

The remaining 36 items were constructed into a questionnaire using a 10-point Likert-type
response format and administered on two separate occasions, one week apart, to 53 undergraduate
students from another section of the same small business management course. Forty-seven students
completed both test and retest administrations of the questionnaire. Nineteen scale items did not
achieve r = .70 standardized Cronbach’s alpha and were rejected. Test-retest correlations of r =.78, p <
.001 for the revenue growth subscale were achieved with the remaining 17 items. Inter-item, scale and

12

<-----Page 12----->scale-if-item-deleted analyses were conducted on the remaining 17 revenue growth items, where
Cronbach’s alpha of .7711 was achieved for the revenue growth subscale. A questionnaire comprised
of the 17-item Revenue Growth subscale; Entrepreneurial Attitude Orientation (EAO) Scale which
includes two subscales: 12-item Personal Control subscale and 14-item Self-esteem subscale;
individual and organizational level questions was assembled. A face-to-face pretest of the survey
package was conducted with 17 non-home-based and home-based entrepreneurs to ensure ease of
understanding of all instructions, scale items, and classification questions, to determine the length of
time for survey completion, and to assess the boredom factor.

Individual and Organizational Measures
Data concerning entrepreneurs, firms and control group members were collected. The
individual-level variables included gender; birth year; family life-cycle stage; education level
operationalized as total number of years of education, type of educational program completed, and the
area of study; experience level incorporating a multidimensional view of experience including
management, entrepreneurial and technical experience in similar and dissimilar industries; level of
family business experience; and presence of family member’s advice in the operation of the business.

Organizational-level variables included type of business being operated (either full-time homebased, part-time home-based, non-home-based or non-entrepreneur); nature of business; previous and
current year revenue and next year forecasted revenue; previous, current and next year forecasted
number of full-time employees; and number of years of business operation since first sale.

Populations and Sampling
A cross-sectional, systematic random sample of 2400 home-based and non-home-based
entrepreneurs was selected from a large local commercial business directory. The control group
consisted of professional, white-collar, non-management employees of a large, information technology
consulting organization. At the time of the study, the organization employed 475 individuals, and 400 of
these were deemed to be non-management, white-collar workers by the Human Resources Director.
Thus, the control group population consisted of 400 subjects (sample units). The intent in selecting a
control group population was to select non-entrepreneur subjects as demographically similar to
entrepreneurs as possible, particularly level of education, which has fairly consistently been shown to be
higher for entrepreneurs than for members of the general population (Robinson & Sexton, 1994; Cooper
& Dunkelberg, 1987). The control group population exhibited comparable age and educational levels to
that of the home-based entrepreneur population, where mean age of 38.5 years, and mean level of
education of college or university completion was reported (Roberts et al., 1995). In addition, control

13

<-----Page 13----->group subjects exhibited similar job characteristics to those types of occupations performed by homebased entrepreneurs, typically white-collar, professional consulting occupations (Roberts, et al., 1995).

Each survey was examined upon return for missing data and inconsistent responses. A total of
544 completed and useable surveys were returned for a response rate of 20.1%. Assumptions of
normality, homoscedasticity and linearity were assessed by visually scanning univariate histograms, a
scatterplot matrix and normal Q-Q probability plots. Histograms indicated approximate normal
distributions for all variables with the exception of EMP1996, EMP1997, AEMP1998, (number of
employees in 1996, 1997 and 1998) and YEARSOP (number of years since business’ first sale) where
positively skewed distributions were identified. A modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, used in this study
to assess the normality of distributions of all metric variables, indicated normality statistics of .343, .314,
.322, and .207 respectively. YEARSOP was transformed to achieve normality by taking the logarithm
(base e) of YEARSOP (TRANSYOP), however normality was not achieved for EMP1996, EMP1997, or
AEMP1998. A scatterplot matrix identified no violations of homoscedasticity where scatters of data
points were roughly equal and random. Normal Q-Q probability plots indicate the assumption of linearity
has been met for all continuous independent variables except EMP1996, EMP1997, and AEMP1998
and for the dependent variable ORGTYPE (type of entrepreneurial behavior).

Data Analysis
Following data diagnostics, response rates, frequencies and percentages, means, selected
cross-tabulations and correlation matrices were produced for all variables in order to obtain an
understanding of the characteristics of responding groups. Tests were conducted to determine
estimates of non-response bias and early versus late response bias. Hypotheses and affects of
organizational and individual variables on entrepreneurial behavior were tested with one-way ANOVA,
statistical techniques for analyzing differences within and between groups, the principal concern of this
study. Forward, stepwise LOGIT regression analysis was used to determine variance explained in the
choice of home-based or non-home based operation by individual and organizational variables. Lastly,
estimation of a structural equation model using LISREL specifying 8 endogenous (Y) and 32 exogenous
(X) variables was completed.

Results

Predictably, the sample contained more males than females, and distribution of gender across
the dependent variable was comparable at all levels. Although the level of male full-time and part-time
home-based business ownership reported here (.76, n=229) exceeded that reported by Roberts et al.
(1995) (.59, n=76) and Orser & Foster (1992) (.58, n=253), it was comparable to levels of male business

ownership reported in other large sample studies (Bates, 1990b; Robinson & Sexton, 1994), where χ =
4.26 (df=1, α =.05). Age of the individuals ( ̅ = 46.5 years, n=536) was also comparable to that
reported in other studies of small business owners (Robinson & Sexton, 1994; Bates, 1995); and of
white-collar workers (Robinson & Sexton, 1994; Cromie, 1987), where the majority of small business
owners were between 25 and 55 years of age. The mean age of individuals in this study was also
2

comparable to that of the general Calgary, Alberta population, where χ =.19 (df=535, α =.001).

Hypothesis tests are summarized in Table 1. Hypotheses 1a, 2b, 2c, and 2d postulated that
non-home-based entrepreneurs would produce stronger perceived personal control of business
outcome scores than would white-collar workers and home-based entrepreneurs, and that full-time
home-based entrepreneurs will exhibit higher scores than part-time home-based entrepreneurs. Nonhome-based entrepreneurs exhibited significantly higher personal control scores than did white-collar
workers (α = .0001), full-time home-based entrepreneurs exhibited significantly higher scores than did
part-time home-based entrepreneurs (α = .022) and full-time home-based entrepreneurs reported higher
scores than white-collar workers (α = .0001). No significant difference was found between non-home-

15

<-----Page 15----->based and home-based entrepreneurs for perceived personal control. Thus, results support hypothesis
1b and 1d.

Homogenous subset analysis using the S-N-K procedure generated three homogenous

subsets: 1) white-collar workers (personal control mean = 6.55, α = .05), 2) part-time home-based
(personal control mean = 6.82, α = .05), and 3) non-home-based and full-time home-based
entrepreneurs (personal control means = 7.08, 7.26 respectively, α= .05).

Hypotheses 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d postulated non-home-based entrepreneurs would produce
higher scores than full-time home-based entrepreneurs and white-collar workers, and that full-time and
part-time home-based entrepreneurs would exhibit higher scores than white-collar workers on perceived
self-esteem in business. Post hoc tests provide support for hypotheses 2b, where non-home-based
entrepreneurs report a significantly higher mean score for self-esteem than did workers (α = .0001). No
significant differences were found between non-home-based and full-time or part-time home-based
entrepreneurs on self-esteem in business. The homogenous subset analysis confirms post hoc results,
where two subsets were derived: 1) white-collar workers (self-esteem mean = 7.25, α = .05) and 2)
entrepreneurs (self-esteem means = 7.51, 7.60, 7.61 for part-time, full-time and non-home-based
respectively, α = .05).

Hypotheses 3a and 3b posited non-home-based business owners would produce higher
preference for business growth in revenue scores than will full-time home-based business owners, and
that a significant difference between full-time and part-time home-based business owners would be
found. No significant difference between non-home-based and full-time home-based entrepreneurs was
found, although a significant difference between full-time and part-time home-based business owners
exists for preference of business growth in revenue. The results provided support for hypothesis 5b,
but not for hypothesis 5a. Two homogenous subsets were produced: 1) white-collar workers and parttime home-based entrepreneurs (revenue means = 6.53, 6.69, α = .05) and 2) full-time home-based and
non-home-based entrepreneurs (revenue means = 7.044, 7.10 respectively, α = .05).

Probability of Non-home-based (Commercial) Business Start-up
Probability of commercial business start-up, p (commercial), was assessed with a stepwise
logistic regression to determine which of the individual and organization variables predicted operation of
a non-home-based business. Results of the stepwise LOGIT regression are presented in Table 2 and
indicate all significant predictors were entered in four steps. The most significant predictors of
commercial operation, in order of entry, were: type of business being operated, previous year’s business
revenue, number of employees, and number of years of education of the entrepreneur. Gender, age,
household stage, all types of experience in similar and dissimilar industries and number of years of

16

<-----Page 16----->business operation were not found to be significant predictors. Management experience in a similar
industry was the only type of experience related to the probability of becoming a commercial
entrepreneur, although not significantly (p. = .6999). Not surprisingly, operation of a retail business was
the most significant predictor of non-home-based business operation (p. = .000). Several variables were
correlated with each other, however correlation coefficients were low or insignificant, suggesting
multicollinearity was not a problem.

Mediating effect of individual and organizational variables
Structural equation modeling is particularly useful in exploratory stages of research, where
relevant theoretical models are at early stages of development (Hair et al., 1995). For this analysis,
number of employees (a continuous variable), not type of entrepreneurial behavior (a categorical
variable) was used as the dependent variable y so as not to violate the requirement of a metric
dependent variable of structural equation modeling techniques. The path diagram, Figure 2, specifies
five dependent (endogenous) variables including attitude subscale scores on personal control, selfesteem and revenue grown (y1 – y3), entrepreneurial attitude constellation (y4), and number of
employees (y5). Predictor variables, or exogenous variables, included individual and organizational level

17

<-----Page 17----->variables of age, gender, life-cycle stage, education, experience type, business type, revenue and years
of business operation. Due to the large number of variables in the model, observable means of
independent and organizational dimensions were used in the analyses of the model. The Chi-square
goodness of fit equaled 124.54 (301 d.f.; p = 1.0) indicating the model is a good fit (Hair, et al., 1995).
The resulting model weighting coefficients, or the level of influence that each construct has on the
number of employees, appear above the arrows. The structural equation model illustrates quite clearly
that individual level variables have much less of an influence on firm size, as measured by number of
employees, than do organizational level variables.

Discussion of Findings

Significant differences in entrepreneurial attitudes were found in three areas: 1) between all
groups on measures of perceived personal control of business outcomes; 2) between full-time homebased entrepreneurs and while-collar workers on measures of self-esteem in business; and 3) between
full-time and part-time entrepreneurs on measures of preference for business growth in revenue. The
population of full-time home-based and non-home based entrepreneurs was surprisingly homogenous in
terms of individual, organizational and attitudinal measurements, which suggests that similarities, not
differences, will be discovered. Additionally, three results were of particular interest: 1) demographic

18

<-----Page 18----->uniqueness of part-time home-based entrepreneurs, 2) homogenous subsets, and 3) absence of
experience as a predictor variable.

First, individual and organizational demographic variables were included in the study to control for
extraneous sources of variances and to determine the extent of differences between groups. These
variables provided interesting insights into the individuals who operate home-based and microenterprises, particularly part-time, home-based entrepreneurs. Part-time home-based entrepreneurs
were significantly older (mean age = 51.12, years) and workers were significantly younger (mean age =
40.03 years) than were full-time and non-home-based entrepreneurs. In addition, part-time homebased entrepreneurs reported the highest mean number of years of education (mean edyears - 16.58
years), a modal educational program of study of graduate university education, and the lowest level of
revenue (mode = <$24,999). This finding suggests that part-time, home-based entrepreneurs are
retired, or early-retired professionals with a high level of education, who have started a home-based
business to generate a supplemental income, or to keep active. These individuals are likely “pushed”
into entrepreneurship, indicated by lower perceived personal control of business outcomes scores for
part-time than full-time home-based and non-home-based entrepreneurs (mean = 6.8).

Second, homogenous subset analysis using Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) procedure indentified
two consistent subsets: 1) full-time home-based entrepreneurs and commercial entrepreneurs; and 2)
part-time home-based entrepreneurs and while-collar workers, provided by post hoc multiple
comparison tests of significance of differences on the three attitude subscales for each group, and
generated the most interesting outcomes of this research in the authors opinions. First, that full-time
home-based entrepreneurs are more like non-home-based entrepreneurs, than like part-time homebased and white-collar workers. No significant differences were found between mean scores for fulltime home-based entrepreneurs and non-home-based entrepreneurs for the three subscales. This
finding contradicts what is suggested about home-based entrepreneurs in the literature, namely that
actions of home-based entrepreneurs are more attuned to the operation of life-style, supplemental
income businesses. Yet, full-time home-based and non-home-based business owners in this study did
not differ significantly in their attitudes toward business growth in revenue.

Homogenous subsets analysis also suggested that part-time, home-based entrepreneurs and
white-collar workers are similar in attitudes, as no significant differences were found between mean
scores for part-time home-based entrepreneurs and white-collar workers for the three subscales. It is
interesting to speculate on the reasons behind the similarities in attitude exhibited by these groups.
Perhaps stability and age account for similarities, where younger, white-collar workers, married with
children present, and older, part-time home-based entrepreneurs, adult-only families, may be in stages

19

<-----Page 19----->in their lives which engender a focus on stable income or income security. The lower scores on
achievement in business for part-time, home-based and white-collar workers than for full-time, homebased and non-home-based entrepreneurs, suggest that these scores may be a determinant of a focus
on a more conservative goal of family income stability than on revenue and employment business
growth. The part-time home-based entrepreneur appears to be a conceptual link between non-homebased and full-time home-based entrepreneurs and white-collar workers, exhibiting characteristics and
attitudes more like white-collar employed workers than entrepreneurs.

Third, much attention in the literature has been given to the backgrounds of entrepreneurs, where
level of education and experience are two factors previously associated with entrepreneurial success.
Not surprisingly, number of years of education was positively associated with the operation of a homebased or non-home-based business, however, experience was not. This may be the result of the
conceptualization of experience as a multi-dimensional construct and operationalization of experience
as the presence or absence of managerial, technical, and entrepreneurial experience in similar or
dissimilar industries, as opposed to a continuous variable, i.e., the number of years of experience.
Nonetheless, contradictory to literature, experience was not a significant predictor of the operation of a
commercial small business or home-based business in this study.

Theoretical contributions and implications of the research
From a theoretical perspective, this research contributes to a more thorough understanding of
the home-based entrepreneur, a necessary antecedent to the development of a more complete
understanding of the process of entrepreneurship. Results suggest that entrepreneurs and workers can
be differentiated on the basis of attitudes toward entrepreneurship, and that studying attitudes and
behaviors may not be mutually exclusive. While the focus of this study was on identifying the
significance of differences among groups of entrepreneurs and between entrepreneurs and workers, the
collection of revenue and employment data links attitudes with individual behavior. These results
provide insight into the nature of different types of home-based and non-home-based entrepreneurs
relative to workers.

This research also contributes to the literature regarding taxonomies of entrepreneurial types,
where part-time entrepreneurs would logically form a separate subgroup for analysis. This study also
suggests that distinctions among home-based entrepreneurs are more than semantic, and that attitudes
toward self-esteem in business, perceived personal control of business outcomes and preference for
business growth in revenue do differentiate full-time from part-time home-based business owners. As
well, the value of studying the individual entrepreneur, in order to gain greater understanding of the
entrepreneurial process, was evidenced in this study. Although this study focused on the micro-

20

<-----Page 20----->business end of the entrepreneurial spectrum, it suggests, perhaps even more significantly due to its
focus on the very small business, that attitudes and characteristics can differentiate types of
entrepreneurs, and that attitudes and characteristics will affect entrepreneurial behavior and
presumably, business outcomes.

Theoretical Limitations
This study included entrepreneurs who had successfully started a small business, and not
nascent, or prospective entrepreneurs. The fact that entrepreneurs in this study had completed the new
venture start-up process has three implications: 1) aspiring entrepreneurs may differ from entrepreneurs
who are already established in business, 2) the entrepreneurial process may affect attitudes of business
founders, 3) attitudes toward entrepreneurship may change over time, and 4) individuals who exhibit
similar characteristics and attitudes will not all become entrepreneurs. In addition, the act of venture
creation, or the time elapsed since start-up may change an individual’s attitude toward entrepreneurship.
For example, McClelland (1961) suggested that an individual’s need for achievement may lessen with
success, or over time. The significance of this potential limitation could be addressed with a pre-test,
post-test experimental design which would estimate the affect of time and experience on behavior.

Methodological Limitations
Methodological issues are addressed according to major categories of research validity not
addressed previously in this paper: 1) construct validity, 2) internal validity and 3) external validity of the
findings. First, response sets, common method variance, and hypothesis guessing represent the most
significant threats to construct validity in this study, although scales used in the research were
constructed according to standard scale development procedures designed to maximize content
saturation and to avoid problems associated with response sets. Thus, it is not believed that
instrumentation poses a significant threat to validity in this study. Independent and dependent variable
data was, however, collected from the same respondents, suggesting potential for single source bias. In
addition, social desirability, questionnaire items similar in content, respondent mood and length of
questionnaire may contribute to common method variance. However, because of differences in
measurement of independent and dependent variables, and the focus on development of the scales and
instrument, common method variance is not believed to be problematic; however, its existence cannot
be ruled out entirely.

Second, as with any cross-sectional, correlational design, the possibility exists that spurious
relationships have been identified and that the direction of associations was misinterpreted. In order to
minimize threats to internal validity, a large random sample was selected; however, it is still conceivable
that those respondents who participated in the study are different from those individuals who did not. A

21

<-----Page 21----->large number of uncontrolled variables are inherent in the entrepreneurship phenomenon itself, as well
as in the research setting, where potential interaction of variables is unpredictable. The size of the
sample is likely to have positively influenced the internal validity of the study; however lack of control
over variables remains a potential threat to internal validity.

Finally, there is concern over the external validity of the study, mainly associated with the
sample. The sample appears to be representative of the home-based and micro-business population,
and to be large and relatively disperse with normal distributions, suggesting that results can be
generalized beyond the study. However, little is known about the home-based business owner
population and few studies exist for validation purposes. In addition, the limit of the scope of the study
to a narrow geographic area may preclude generalizability of findings.

Directions for Research Methodology in Entrepreneurship
This study proposed use of attitude theory as a more dynamic model of the entrepreneur and
the association with entrepreneurial behavior, than traditional trait-based or characteristic approaches.
This paper provided a cursory review of assumptions underlying psychological research and highlighted
the importance of understanding historical roots of theories and methods borrowed from broader social
science contexts. This leads to a global research program recommendation that researchers assume
more responsibility for understanding the nature of theories and methods proposed for use in
entrepreneurship research. Literature reviewed highlighted the fact that most entrepreneurship
researchers refer to McClelland’s (1961) early work as the origin of the study of the psychology of the
entrepreneur. In fact, in the decade which preceded McClelland, psychology literature is rife with
discussion relating to the inability of trait-based research, particularly single traits, to predict single acts
of behavior, a category in which the act of venture creation is most likely to fit. Any research program in
entrepreneurship which hopes to significantly advance knowledge of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial
processes must have at its core the recognition that the entrepreneurial event is dynamic, holistic,
discontinuous and unique; that it is initiated by an act of human volition; and that the individual interacts
with the environment in a dynamic and reciprocally causal way.

Although demographic research has been criticized for not adding substance to the theoretical
base in entrepreneurship research (Gartner, 1988), support is given in this study for continued use of
demographic research to capture changes in dimensions of the phenomenon. More than any other
personal level variables that enter the new venture creation process, demographic and human capital
variables are likely to change over time, rendering older studies obsolete for current business start-ups.
For example, age of the entrepreneur, or life-cycle stage will reflect different social situations and
contexts of key business decisions. Longitudinal and panel studies will capture these changes over time

22

<-----Page 22----->whereas cross-sectional studies will not. More than any other approach to the study of entrepreneurial
behavior, psychological studies can be criticized for lacking an understanding of theories and methods
being borrowed and applied in the entrepreneurship literature, such as Begley’s (1995) use of the
Farmingham Type-A behavior scale developed in the 1970’s to predict coronary disease, as a scale to
distinguish founders from non-founding managers. Interactional psychology’s more recent
conceptualizations of person-environment interaction provide an opportunity for entrepreneurship
researchers to eschew trait-based approaches and to develop more complete causal models of
entrepreneurship.

Areas of Additional Research in Home-based Entrepreneurship
The results of this study suggest several topic areas for additional research. First, is more
rigorous investigation of the association between attitudes and performance. Do high scores on attitude
subscales correspond to high performance in terms of revenue or intentions toward business growth?
Second, is a study of the organizational life-cycle of home-based and micro-enterprises. How do
organizational life-cycles of home-based and micro-businesses relate to those of larger businesses?
Third, is further investigation of part-time home-based businesses in other regions to determine the
extent to which the findings here are idiosyncratic. Fourth, is further investigation regarding the
psychological nature of small business owners. This study found significant differences among
entrepreneurs on three attitudes suggesting there may be other distinguishing attitudes. Further
investigation may identify other, more successful discriminating factors, such as attitude toward risktaking in business. Investigations of this type could produce fruitful research which could be utilized for
micro-economic development initiatives as well as furthering understanding of the entrepreneur.
