CALL FOR PAPERS

Special Section in the International Journal of Psychology

The Development of Entrepreneurship: Person x Context
Interactions
Entrepreneurship is widely considered a central 21st
century skill. Hence, policy makers emphasize the
importance of entrepreneurship education to effectively
promote entrepreneurial thinking and acting. However, research evaluating the effectiveness of existing
entrepreneurship promotion, advice, and education programs targeting the adult population (e.g., university
students) indicates that these programs are often not
very effective. In this Special Section we therefore seek
to tackle the fundamental questions of how does an
entrepreneurial mindset actually develop and what is
the role of psychological factors in this development.
While many entrepreneurship researchers agree that psychological factors (e.g., personality, identity, cognitions,
emotion and passion, control beliefs, risk-taking) play
a key role for entrepreneurial activity over the lifespan,
the questions of how these factors develop and affect,
and get affected by, entrepreneurial outcomes (e.g.,
entrepreneurial intentions, activities, and success and
failure) are still on table.
Existing research on the vocational development of
entrepreneurs mainly studied different developmental
levels (ranging from biological, psychosocial, human
agency, to various context–levels) separately (e.g., by
focusing on genes; personality factors, or context factors
alone). However, modern meta-theoretical frameworks
like the biopsychosocial systems view of human development stress that it is particularly the interplay of,
and transactions between, these different levels that
produce developmental outcomes. The aim of this Special Section is therefore to connect otherwise loose
ends in the entrepreneurship literature by integrating
research on biological, psychosocial, contextual, and
developmental aspects. We seek to publish papers that
advance our knowledge on the biopsychosocial interplay through which psychological factors relevant for
entrepreneurship evolve, develop, affect, and are affected
by entrepreneurial outcomes. We want to learn more
about the processes taking place between the different
levels of entrepreneurial development. Examples are
studies on GeneXEnvironment interactions, TraitsXContext interactions, PersonXCulture interactions in
the career development of entrepreneurs. We particularly invite empirical research papers that address the
following issues:
© 2015 International Union of Psychological Science

• A focus on two or more developmental levels (biological, psychosocial and agency, and contexts levels) in
the prediction of entrepreneurial outcomes (e.g., intentions, behavior, and success), preferably by using longitudinal designs and/or multi-level designs
• A focus on interactions of predictors of entrepreneurial
outcomes either within a developmental stage (e.g.,
adolescence, early adulthood, middle, or late adulthood) or across developmental stages.
• A focus on an reciprocal interplay of the different
developmental levels over time (e.g., How do the different levels affect each other over time? How does this
leads to an entrepreneurial mindset?)
• An international focus considering cross-cultural
issues/perspectives from the Non-Western world
Researchers interested in submitting an article should
send a letter of intent no later than 15 February 2016 to
martin.obschonka@uni-saarland.de and per.davidsson@
qut.edu.au. The letter should include the tentative title and
an abstract of 750 words maximum (incl. theoretical statement, sample description, preliminary results, and potential implications). Potential contributors will be selected
based on originality of research, overall diversity of topics, and fit with the theme of the Special Section. Successful authors will be invited to submit first drafts of
manuscripts by 15 September 2016. All manuscripts will
be subject to an external review process.
