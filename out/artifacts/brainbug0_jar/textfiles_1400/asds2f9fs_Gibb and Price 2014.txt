<-----Page 3----->1. Introduction
Developing an ‘entrepreneurial mindset’ within the class room environment is a challenge for any
educator. It demands the formulation of integrated learning and teaching strategy which align
intended learning outcomes with the effective selection of pedagogy. To assist the educator
seeking to create entrepreneurial outcomes in learners, this compendium brings together a range of
pedagogic guides. Each guide stems from the educational tradition of ‘learning by doing’ to support
the development of entrepreneurial mindsets of learners. The aim of each of these guides is to
support the development of entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviours, as well as building the skills
and knowledge of an enterprising person. Each pedagogical guide is constructed in a standardised
format, which outlines core components, how to use it and explore its relevance within
entrepreneurial learning and how it builds entrepreneurial outcomes. To support these 44
pedagogies, this compendium first explores the educational traditions that underpin this approach
and details a key focus upon the entrepreneurial facilitation within small group working.
This compendium provides a practical foundation for addressing the key question of ‘how to teach’
enterprise and entrepreneurship, rather than ‘what to teach’. This distinct focus is critical in building
an entrepreneurial mindset through Affective, Conative as well as the Cognitive aspects of learning.
To achieve this depth of learning, this compendium reaches beyond the teaching traditions of the UK
& Northern American University Business Schools entrepreneurship programmes (such as the ‘case
study’ method) to draw from the teaching traditions and pedagogy of a wide range of disciplines.
This breadth of approach is built upon an educational tradition of higher level skill development that
seeks to build learning which can be transferred and applied outside the class room.
This compendium outlines over 44 examples for use within entrepreneurial education and, by
focusing upon delivery/transmission methods as well the entrepreneurial outcomes framework as
classifications or ‘route-maps’, this text also provides guidance as to how to incorporate these into
your teaching. Rapid accessibility is built into this compendium to support all educators to engage
with this approach in their next class; providing immediate opportunities to test out and explore
these methods within their own teaching. Due to the clarity provided by this ‘route-map’
approach, this compendium will be invaluable to the ‘new-to-enterprise’ academic, as well as those
who are already working to support entrepreneurial outcomes in others, as it serves as both
guidance and inspiration to those developing new approaches to entrepreneurial teaching.
Objectives

2. Enterprise and Entrepreneurship
In developing any entrepreneurial learning strategy, there is a need to resolve a conceptual
confusion concerning the relationship between Enterprise, Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This
confusion impacts adversely upon efforts to develop Entrepreneurship Education as an academic
field, but also in the minds of learners. This section will explore the key terms within
Entrepreneurship Education, providing a critical underpinning for the educator and the pedagogies
contained with this compendium.

2.1 Towards a Definition
There are numerous definitions put forward in both the academic and practitioner literature relating
to the Entrepreneurial concept and the notion of the enterprising person. Most definitions of an
‘entrepreneur’ are influenced by the work of economists and, in particular, the Austrian economist
Schumpeter (1883 –1950). Following this tradition, the focus of such definitions is upon the role of
the entrepreneur in creating and grasping opportunities, and combining resources in an innovative
way within an economic model of growth. The UK Government defines ‘an entrepreneur as ‘anyone
who attempts a new business or new venture creation, such as self employment, a new business
organisation, social enterprise’ (DTi 2004). However Drucker (1985) recognised an entrepreneur as
more than a business owner/manager, by defining them as achieving an ‘upgrade in yield from
resources’ (p 25) whilst others, such as Timmons have made a critical distinction in stating that it is
the ‘pursuit of opportunity without regard to the resources currently under one’s control or
influence’ (1989: 16–17). Both of these definitions recognise the need for access to resources to
create the ‘new’ from the pre-existing; placing the emphasis upon the talent and vision of the
entrepreneur to add significant value to resources.
It is clear that the entrepreneur is seen as the agent for economic renewal, the instrument for
creative destruction in pursuit of opportunity, facilitating innovation via a process of new
combinations of factors of production (Gibb 200x).
Such views have supported the
governmental/policy view that entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education are the panacea
for stagnating or declining economic activity internationally (Matlay, 2001).
However
internationally, there is still no single definition of a small–medium sized enterprise (SME), mainly
because of the wide diversity of businesses, although the key determining characteristics are
common – relating to turnover and the number of employees (under 50).
These overlaps and distinctions of meaning can cause confusion if not clearly appreciated, especially
as entrepreneurship and innovation are closely linked in the policy rhetoric and governmental
business strategy in many countries. The problem with this definition, for educators, is that it places
5

<-----Page 5----->the entrepreneur narrowly into an economic and business context. The main focus of
entrepreneurship education in business schools, for example, is still on new venture management
and the business planning process that purportedly goes with it.
This strong business stance can lead to neglect of concern for the pursuit of entrepreneurial
behaviour in wider personal and social contexts. It also fits less well with the current, almost
universal, international, policy emphasis upon the relationship of entrepreneurial behaviour to
employability and the notion of an entrepreneurial culture – often described as developing an
‘Entrepreneurial Mindset’ in the population as a whole. The European Union describes this as a ‘key
competence for all, helping young people to be creative and confident in whatever they undertake’
(EU 2006).
The entrepreneurial mind is seen as being central to wider graduate employability in general as well
as a wide range of personal and organisational contexts. This demands that the concept, while still
incorporating the establishment of new ventures in business, also embraces opportunity-seeking
and realisation, and the pursuit of entrepreneurial behaviour, in any context along with capacity to
design and grow entrepreneurial organisations of all kinds. It is also seen to have relevance to the
individual as consumer, family member and member of the community as well as worker, living in an
increasingly globalised life-world of greater uncertainty and complexity.
The focus within the higher educational context is therefore upon the ‘Enterprising
Person/Entrepreneurial Mindset’ (displaying a number of behavioural and attitudinal attributes
commonly associated with the entrepreneurial individual) in a wide range of contexts. This
approach has greater acceptance within the education system and has led to international
exploration of how to support the development of the individual as an entrepreneur (be that within
a business, social or personal context).
To assist in the clarification of these terms, the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship (UK)
has, from its experience, provided the following key definitions:

Exhibit 1: Definitions
“Having an idea and making it happen”
The Enterprise Concept focuses upon the development of the enterprising person and the
enterprising mindset through a demonstration of enterprising skills, behaviours and attitudes across
a diversity of contexts. These include intuitive decision making, the capacity to make things happen
autonomously, networking, initiative taking, opportunity identification, creative problem solving,
strategic thinking, and self efficacy. The focus is on creating entrepreneurial ways of doing, thinking,
feeling, communicating, organising and learning.
The Entrepreneurial Concept focuses upon the application of these enterprising skills and the
entrepreneurial mindset in setting up a new venture, developing/growing an existing venture or
designing an entrepreneurial organisation. The context might be business, social enterprise,
charitable purpose, non-governmental organisations or public sector bodies.
Entrepreneurship ‘makes it happen’.
The Innovation Concept is the product of the Entrepreneurial Concept.
Innovation is defined as creating and exploiting opportunities for new ways of doing things resulting
in better products and services, systems and ways of managing people and organisations. The
successful pursuit of innovation is a function of individual enterprising endeavour and
entrepreneurial organisation capacity.
Entrepreneurship is a necessary pre-condition for Innovation

<-----Page 6----->3. Educational Traditions
The basic understanding how learning occurs is critical to the development of effective
entrepreneurial learning and teaching strategy. This section explores five key frameworks which
underpin the development of the entrepreneurial teaching ethos outlined in within this
compendium (section 5). These frameworks stem from a tradition of experiential learning (Bloom
1959; Hilgard 1980; Kolb 1984) and a pragmatic appreciation of the delivery options (Elton 1977) for
educators working with large groups. Most critically this section explores the range of pedagogies
that can be used in a programme to deal with the Affective and Conative as well as the Cognitive
aspects of learning (Kyro 2006).
To appreciate these in more detail, explore five frameworks (A-E) which help illuminate the learning
process. These provide a brief overview of how students learn and how an educator can support
learning through the choice of an appropriate instruction method.

Classification of teaching / learning methods (Elton 1977)

Each of these will be briefly presented in turn, starting with Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning Domains.

A. Domains: Bloom’s taxonomy (1956)
Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy divides educational objectives into three overlapping ‘domains’ – cognitive
(knowledge) affective (attitude) and psychomotor (skills).

<-----Page 7----->By recognising that there is more than one type of learning, Bloom defined 3 categories or ‘domains’
in which learning takes place; defining them, as Cognitive, Affective and Psychomotor. Each is
detailed below:
Cognitive: The cognitive domain involves the development of intellectual skills from
knowledge (knowing), recall and recognition, through to critical argument (synethising and
evaluating).
Affective: The affective domain includes the way emotions are handled, which involves
values, enthusiasms, motivation and attitudes. Recognised as probably the most difficult to
achieve, attitude is shaped most powerfully by ‘real life’ experiences and group learning.
Psychomotor (Simpson 1972): The psychomotor domain includes physical skill development
such as movement, co-ordination and motor skills. The development of these objectives is
most effective through performing and practising the activity.
Within Exhibit 2, each domain is explored as a hierarchy, which builds in complexity (working from
the simplest to the most complex, at the lower end of the table). To build mastery of any of these
domains, the lower level skills are learnt first; as mastery is created from working from lower
through to higher levels.
A full appreciation of this model clearly impacts upon learning strategy that needs to be employed to
support effective student learning. For example, to achieve lower cognitive objectives, such as the
transmission of facts or knowledge, mass instruction techniques (such as lectures – see Framework E
in this series) are most effective. Higher cognitive objectives require student involvement in the
learning process, which is most effectively achieved in small group working (see section 5).

B. Psychological traditions
As Bloom outlined (exhibit 2) cognitive development is concerned with reception, recognition,
judgment and remembering and affective development relates to the response to the subject, the
likes and dislikes and the feelings, emotions and moods. However, these are usefully explored with
the concept of conation which, as a relatively recent term (1980), embraces the active drive to make
sense of something; as any inclination, drive, or desire to do something (within such notions of
motivation, commitment, impulse and striving). Ernest Hilgard (1980) outlined conation as one of
the three processes underlying three central human functions - cognition (perception, memory, and
the processing of information), affection, and conation as the aspect of mental processes or
behaviour directed toward action or change and including impulse, desire, volition, and striving.
Conation relates to ‘how’ tasks are processed as well providing insight as to how individuals are
motivated to undertake tasks.
Engaging further with this psychological tradition has developed further notions within
entrepreneurial learning such as the notion of self efficacy as ‘the belief in one’s capabilities to
organise and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations’ (Bandura
1995, p. 2). Effectively, it can be defined as one's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific
situations, and this belief subsequently influences the specific situation being tackled as self belief
creates positive/negative thought patterns, which impact upon




Behavioural choices (decision making; risk taking; engagement in new opportunities)
Motivation (ability to start and complete tasks)
Response to failure

8

<-----Page 8----->C. Kolbs’ experiential cycle (1984)
With the belief that students learn most effectively at deeper levels if they are actively engaged in
the process (rather than being passive receivers of information) Kolb (1984) created a cyclical model
which identifies four key stages through which the student passes. Termed ‘experiential learning’,
these stages are:
1. Active experimentation: comes from planning learning (which can be involvement in
learning objectives; engagement with approaches/options; or creation of a learning
contract)
2. Actual experience: this is the ‘doing’ which provides the rich experience
3. Reflecting: this is generally accepted to be the most difficult for most learners, who are
asked to articulate how they ‘feel’ and reflect upon
a. What they learnt
b. How they learnt it
c. Why they learnt it
d. Whether the learning experience could be more effective
4. Theorising: this is a critical stage of learning, which builds knowledge and supports further
reflection.
To gain maximum benefit learners may repeat, and deepen, their learning as they revolve around
this cyclical model of learning.

Exhibit 3: Kolb’s Learning Cycle (1984)

D. Experiential Learning: Ripples of Learning (Race 2008)
Race (2005; 2008) advocates 7 factors that underpin successful learning, which he suggests all
continuously affect each other (as ripples on a pond) rather than following Kolb’s view of a
sequential cycle. Race’s approach is also based upon experiential learning, but places motivation
(‘wanting to learn’) at the heart of learning and as the driver for all the other 6 ‘ripples’ (Exhibit 4).

9

<-----Page 9----->Exhibit 4: 7 Ripples (Race 2007)
Together, these ripples create the factors for successful learning (see Exhibit 5) which can be viewed
as mutually supporting the learning experience,

Wanting to learn

This basic underpinning of educational and psychological theory surrounding experiential learning
has outlined the domains in which learning can take place (Bloom 1956) and explored the most
effective approaches to learning (Kolb 1985; Race 2007).
However, any understanding of learning theory needs to be anchored within the practicalities of
teaching (class room sizes; facilities; resource available etc). It is therefore useful for any educator
to reflect upon the intended learning outcomes, with an awareness of the benefits and constraints

broadly using the basic mode of instruction (Exhibit 6 below).

Based on the classifications of Evolution Educational Technology: Elton (1977)
It is clear from exhibit 6 that each of these three techniques has benefits which can be matched
against Bloom’s learning taxonomy.

By recognising that mass instruction techniques, such as lecturing, are most effective at the
transmission of information for recall as knowledge, whereas group learning and small group work
supports the development of higher level skills, the foundations of an effective teaching and learning
strategy can be created.
The next step is to determine exactly what is being taught through the development of appropriate
learning outcomes, as selection of the most appropriate delivery method (Exhibit 6) is driven by the
learning outcome sought (section 4) and the domain level (Exhibit 7) at which it needs to be
employed by the learner.

11

<-----Page 11----->Having established these traditions, together with three core concepts (enterprise; entrepreneurship
and innovation) it is to the wider concept of entrepreneurial teaching that this compendium now
turns, to determine the appropriate learning outcomes and explore the use of group learning within
enterprise.
4. Learning Outcomes

This section explores entrepreneurial teaching – that is, the learning outcomes that are sought
within entrepreneurial learning and how is it delivered through use of the pedagogical notes. The
By building upon the basic underpinning of the educational traditions, the entrepreneurial outcomes
framework can be used to structure entrepreneurial pedagogy.

Learning Outcomes Framework
The classic learning outcome describes what a student should be able to do in order successfully to
complete a course of study (Baume 2009); however much of the focus of traditional
Entrepreneurship Programme is upon delivering ‘inputs’ into the entrepreneurial process. For
example in business oriented education there will be conventional subject inputs of marketing,
finance, operations, control, leadership, etc. There is also often much emphasis upon the business
plan, as a vehicle of assessment at all levels, on the assumption that it will reach all the learning
outcomes within entrepreneurial education.
There seems, however, to be a major absence of a concept frame relating to the Entrepreneurial
Person which in turn lends itself to production of a template of outcomes designed to support the
concept. Such a frame has been constructed as the basis for the development of an approach which
to some substantial degree challenges the conventional business focused concept of the
entrepreneur. This construct focuses upon:


Entrepreneurial behaviours, skills and attributes including emotional intelligence



Preparation for the ‘way of life’ of the entrepreneur



Entrepreneurial values and ways of doing things, feeling things, organising things,
communicating things and learning things experientially



Entrepreneurial behaviour and management in different contexts – not just business



Ideas harvesting, grasping and realisation of opportunity



Managing entrepreneurially, holistically and strategically (know how)



Managing and learning from relationships (know who)

The above constitute key proposed target outcomes from entrepreneurial learning and are
embedded in the Outcomes Framework (adopted by UK’s National Council for Graduate
Entrepreneurship) and set out below, as eight key headlines.

12

<-----Page 12----->Exhibit 7: Framework for Entrepreneurial Outcomes
A. Key entrepreneurial behaviours, skills and
attitudes have been developed.

B. Student’s clearly empathises with,
understand and ‘feel’ the life-world of the
entrepreneur
C. Key entrepreneurial values have been
inculcated

D. Motivation towards a career in
entrepreneurship has been built and students
clearly understand the comparative benefits
E. The students understand the process (stages)
of going into business, the associated tasks and
learning needs

F. Students have the key generic competencies
associated with entrepreneurship

G. Students have a grasp of key business how
to’s associated with the start up process

H. Students understand the nature of the
relationships they need to develop with key
stakeholders and are familiarised with them

13

<-----Page 13----->These outcomes have been designed to operate at the general level – that is, to be applicable to any
learner, at any level. This means that they can be tailored to support a range of levels (Bloom 1965)
by altering the level of skill development sought in each area. In order to develop effective learning
outcomes, it is generally agreed that they need to meet the criteria below:








Active – it describes what students can do at the end of the programme of study
Attractive – students want to achieve it (meaningful to them)
Comprehensible – students know what it means (clear)
Appropriate – to the student’s current goals and career plans (again, meaningful)
Attainable – most students will mostly meet it, with due effort (reasonable)
Assessable – we can see if it has been achieved (demonstrable)
Visible – in the course booklet and on any virtual learning environment (accessible).

Adapted from Baume (2008)
This approach helps shape effective learning outcomes for learners within a range of programmes.
By matching this approach to selected entrepreneurial outcomes, a cohesive learning strategy which
builds the entrepreneurial mindset at all levels can be achieved.
In order to develop these further, it is useful to understand the entrepreneurial learning outcomes in
detail, as shown below:

The above Exhibit clearly shows that the range of outcomes that can support the development of an
entrepreneurial mindset; and whilst this is not an exclusive list, it does provide support to those
working to create entrepreneurial outcomes in others.
Having outlined generic entrepreneurial outcomes that can be adapted for learners working at
different levels, through the application of Baume’s (2009) checklist, the choice of pedagogy is now
critical to support the development of these intended outcomes in learners. The following section
explores entrepreneurial learning and introduces the pedagogical guide format.

5. Entrepreneurial Teaching
The preceding sections have helped identify the key constructs that help underpin the ethos of
entrepreneurial teaching, namely:




Key defining terms for entrepreneurship, enterprise and innovation (section 2)
Foundational frameworks from education and psychology (experiential learning) (3)
Learning Outcomes (section 4)

From this, we are now able to explore ‘what is entrepreneurial teaching?’ before exploring the full
range of pedagogic guides.
Entrepreneurial teaching is designed to maximise the potential for stimulating entrepreneurial
attributes and insight and equipping participants for action. In particular, it is focused upon
practicing behaviours, developing skills and reinforcing attributes associated with being an
enterprising person. It is based upon the assumption that all persons have some capacity for
behaving entrepreneurially and enhancing that capacity. It is worth noting that, although some will
be naturally more enterprising than others, every person will demonstrate a different range and mix
of potential; in that, some will be more creative; some will be more capable of taking initiatives
independently; others will be better at networking and so on.
There will need to be a strong emphasis upon teaching ‘for’ as opposed to ‘about’ (Levie 1999).



‘For’ courses are focused upon creating enterprising mindsets and exploring what it feels like
to be an entrepreneur. They involve presentation skills (pitching; groups) and follow the
ethos within this compendium.
‘About’ entrepreneurship tend to draw upon a traditional pedagogy of lectures and text
book to explore trends with small businesses and sectors and are therefore assessed
through more traditional methods of written exams.

17

<-----Page 17----->Within this classification, these courses are taught using distinctly different pedagogies, as well as
being assessed differently; with teaching ‘for’ referring to the constant targeting of the practice of
learning upon the ‘know how’, the ‘know who’ and the ‘need to know’; as related to achieving a
personal and/or organisational objectives. This involves combining skills and knowledge and,
contrary to what often seems to be a popular belief, does not eschew taking a conceptual approach.
The construction of entrepreneurial teaching can be divided into the categories of:




The ‘focus’ of learning (Exhibit 9)
The ‘process’ of learning (Exhibit 10) and
The process of teaching (Exhibit 11).

Exploring the issues through these frameworks throws up challenges for educators as shown below:

From Gibb (2007) IEEP course notes
Exhibit 9 indicates how the focus of learning has moved from the past - the models of mass
instruction (Elton 1977) in which the educator take the place of the ‘sage on the stage’ transmitting
knowledge through mass instruction - to the ‘future’ – where there is a need for students to resolve
problems and respond with creativity and insight.
These changes within the focus of learning (Exhibit 9) impact upon the level of learning that is
required, as learning processes need to move from recall and knowledge (lower level objectives) to
complex affective skills as problem solving (see Exhibit 10 below).

Exhibit 9 and 10 indicate critical shifts that demand an approach to teaching, which reviews the role
of the student; the approach and focus of the learning and, ultimately the role of the educator, to
‘guide on the side’ – a supportive facilitator of learning, rather than the knowledge ‘expert’ (see
Exhibit 11).

Adapted from Gibb (2007) IEEP course notes
This approach can primarily be valued/assessed in terms of the degree to which it enables
participants to do things that they could not do before; and is designed to change attitudes towards
the ways of doing, thinking, organising, communicating and learning things, rather than teach the
‘right approach’.
This teaching approach is arguably the core of entrepreneurial learning and can forms the basis for
assessment of the value of the numerous pedagogical methods within this guide (see section 7).

Towards small group teaching?
It is now clear that entrepreneurial learning focuses upon the development of the entrepreneurial
mindset, and draws upon the development of higher level skills affective, cognitive and cognitive to
achieve this. Elton’s classifications (1977) indicate that the extent to which skill level is developed is
dependent upon the selection of the most appropriate delivery method. This suggests that even
with large class sizes, interactive engagement, which follows a model of experiential learning (Kolb
1984; Race 2007) through small discussions, voting, polls and questions to speakers can support
higher levels of student engagement. Such high levels of student engagement within the learning
process be achieved within large lecture theatre style class rooms, as the classification of pedagogic
notes (13-15) will show.
The traditions of education across the world have been rooted in mass instruction techniques;
however entrepreneurial learning draws extensively from the use of small groups as entrepreneurial
outcomes are best secured in this delivery method. It is therefore important to explore this in more

19

<-----Page 19----->detail; and to build familiarity with the format of the pedagogical guides, this will be presented in the
format of a note (4 sections - see section 1)

1. Use of Small Group Teaching
1. What is the use of Small Group Teaching?
Working with small groups is as a classic interactive device with a participant class where the
participant numbers, space, seating arrangements in the room and physical facilities for break out
are such as to make it possible. Group work can be undertaken as a short interactive discussion of a
point or question set by the facilitator. It can be used to consider an issue, critical incident or short
case as part of a session (see pedagogical guides) or it can be the formation of a group for
preparation of work for a further session, for example a case or a demonstration. Groups can be as
small as 2; though with a maximum of 5/6 if opportunity is to be given for adequate participation by
all parties.
Where group work is to be part of the dynamics of the learning process ‘in class’ then it usually
demands that the class size is restricted to a ‘capacity’ for maximum of six groups. Larger numbers
can be covered where there is team teaching and therefore greater scope for individual group
mentoring and the exercise does not demand whole class feedback.

2. How is the group exercise constructed?
Group membership needs to be carefully selected. Criteria for selection will depend on the task and
the composition of participants. Composition criteria might include: level and nature of experience;
seniority mix; personality; age; gender; level of expertise in relation to the task. Group exercises are
also a means of building ‘know-who’ (network) relationships as well as bonding and therefore mixing
groups up at different times is often desirable to allow students to learn from each other, as well as
how others work and think.
For constant and highly interactive enterprise teaching then round table groupings are ideal. Groups
can then be asked, for example, to quickly discuss an issue or debate a question, for example


‘Are entrepreneurs born not made?’



‘Are all small business owners entrepreneurs?’



‘How would you evaluate whether you could trust someone in a business deal?’

They are also ideal for encouraging a period of reflection on an issue, exchanging experience or
counselling each other. As an example in running a programme for new entrepreneurs and after
class discussion of ‘what makes a good idea’, groups sitting together can be asked to evaluate each
other’s idea against the criteria agreed.
Break out groupings are designed to tackle more substantive issues – either a mini case or asked to
arrive at a set of conclusions concerning a major issue.
Key issues, often neglected in group work are: ensuring that the group is clear about the task and
desired outcomes; facilitation and guiding a group without controlling it or just leaving it to ‘get on
with things’; and ensuring that there is adequate time for the task.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Group work is a major component of ensuring ownership of learning; ‘learning by doing’; by
inventing things, making things up, communicating orally, building teams, building confidence in a
20

<-----Page 20----->situation of low exposure and solving problems creatively. It also often simulates getting things
done under pressure and making decisions without too much information.

4. Outcomes
It is important that outcomes are carefully considered and that space is given for evaluation and
reflection of the work of the group. A common mistake – easily done under time pressure – is to fail
to allow time for reflection and building on the group outcome. ‘Report Backs’ do not always
achieve this and may bore the rest of the group who can become restless listening to others. Asking
the group to write up properly, in good presentation format, its findings is often a more rewarding
outcome as the process forces coherence. Also the role of the facilitator is critical here in
highlighting key learning points; making reference to theories and frameworks and deepening the
learner’s knowledge from ‘observation’ and ‘reflection’ into structured thought and deeper
cognition.
Having stated the importance of the role of the tutor as a facilitator, and tutor within small group
teaching, it is now important to focus upon entrepreneurial facilitation. This again will be presented
within the format of the pedagogical guides, to support familiarisation.

2 Use of Entrepreneurial Facilitation
1. What is the use of Entrepreneurial Facilitation of Small Group Work?
It has been argued above that small group work has a valuable part to play in the experiential
learning required to support the development of new mindsets. This is because of the scope it
provides for personal contact, engagement and expression. It also, however, can be the means for
support of the development of a range of entrepreneurial behaviours and skills, for example,
persuasion, empathy, rhetoric, creative problem solving, development and exploration of ideas,
building of self confidence and self belief and feelings of autonomy and ownership. Such
developments, however, are dependent on the manner in which the group is facilitated.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
In general in small group work the cognitive aims are to provide the means for deeper embedding of
knowledge via an informal process of discussion exchange and peer questioning in a ‘safe’
environment. In this respect there is an obligation on the facilitator to:
 set broad learning objectives
 bring forward the key questions to be addressed
 keep the discussion focused around these (limiting any ‘drift’ that might be dysfunctional)
 ensure that there is process of engagement of all participants, and
 summarise the final outcome in relation to objectives
Key facilitator behaviours in these respects include
 summarising
 proposing
 building
 reflecting
 clarifying and
 open ended questioning

21

<-----Page 21----->All of which are to be pursued in a supportive atmosphere of the ‘ground rules’ established in the
class room.

Over and above these objectives and behaviours the process allows for focus upon development of
entrepreneurial behaviours, skills and attributes. To assess success in his respect facilitators can
evaluate their ‘process’ performance in terms of:










to what degree did they create ‘ownership’ of the learning process by participants?
to what extent were new ideas generated?
what risks were taken in the discussion and how were these useful?
how much ‘challenging’ took place?
to what degree have we built an atmosphere of greater empathy between participants and
greater trust?
how much have participants learnt about each other?
how much have participants learnt from each other (effective exchange)?
to what degree has he group developed as a team?
have we learned anything about effective team work?

To create positive outcomes in respect of the above may require entrepreneurial innovation, for
example:










placing the leadership facilitator role with participants and using group feedback to
comment on their role
using brainstorming techniques during the discussion
breaking the group in smaller (one to one) groups to come up with views on different issues
for debate
by the wider group or seeking dispute resolution between two or more of participants
without dislodging the whole group
inviting role playing of different sides of the arguments as seen through the eyes of selected
externals (for example how would an owner manager see this?) bringing up for discussion
aspects of the process (for example why has Miss X dominated the discussion? Why has Mr Y
seemingly opted out?) While these are risky strategies they ultimately will encourage
openness and can be approached in a supportive climate.
allowing time for reflection on what the group has learnt about group management
processes
exploring innovative ways of presenting the findings from the group, this encouraging
creativity but also recognition that emotions play an important role in learning
allowing time for reflection on what the participants have learned about each other (quick
exchange feedback)

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The group process is designed to simulate process of team problem solving and ideas generation as
in the ‘real entrepreneurial’ world. It builds recognition of how to deal with common issues in this
process, for example individual dominance, ‘free-loading’ by those who minimally participate,
process of informal power and control, conflict resolution and hostility.

4. Outcomes

22

<-----Page 22----->Participants will have enhanced their capacity to motivate and work with teams in an
entrepreneurial manner. As a facilitator, the key role is to ensure the learning outcomes have been
achieved/enhanced and knowledge more deeply embedded.
With group work established as a key approach for the entrepreneurial educator, it is to the
pedagogic notes that this compendium now turns. This next section will provide an overview as to
how the guides can be accessed and shows how these techniques can be used for individualised and
mass instruction learning, as needed (exhibit 13-15).
Having established the central underpinnings of entrepreneurial teaching, the pedagogic guides can
now be introduced. Structured around 4 key categories, they are designed to be highly accessible
and to that end, 3 route-maps are provided to assist educators to adopt these approaches into their
teaching quickly and easily.

5. Accessing the Pedagogical Guides
Building upon the educational underpinning and exploration of entrepreneurial learning, it is to the
pedagogical guides that this compendium now turns, as these now form the core of this book. This
compendium is designed to support the educator as they develop entrepreneurial outcomes in
others. To that end, they are structured to be as accessible as possible. This is achieved by using a
standardised format (detailed below) and providing several ‘route-maps’ to support the selection of
pedagogies within teaching practice.
These ‘route-maps’ include mapping against the outcomes framework and also Elton’s classification
of delivery methods.

Using the guides
The overall aim is to encourage educators to think about the range of pedagogies that might be used
in an entrepreneurship/enterprise programme to deal with the Affective and Conative as well as the
Cognitive aspects of learning (see section 3). Each of the pedagogical notes is presented within a
standardised format to assist the educator in their selection. There are four key headings, which
help define the approach, indicate its use, purpose and the learning outcome it supports (Exhibit 12).

<-----Page 28----->Classification Mapping
Although earlier discussion (section 4) indicates that small group learning is often most appropriate
in developing the higher cognitive skills and deeper understanding that is required to support the
development of an entrepreneurial mindset. However there can be constraints for any educator
(class sizes; class environment & facilities; time limitations) which mean that working in small groups
is not always possible, or as rich an experience as the educator may intend. Therefore, whilst all the
pedagogical guides could be classified as most appropriate (and therefore best used) within small
group working, it is has been possible to identify areas where the approaches outlined in the
pedagogical notes can enhance or support higher cognitive development, whilst in a traditional
lecture theatre (mass instruction facility). This compendium will draw upon Elton’s (1977)
classification of delivery methods to help structure the 44 pedagogies as a ‘route-map’.
Note: that where the columns are linked this indicates that approaches can be deepened by working
across these classifications. For example, whilst it is possible to undertake the development of an
elevator pitch; sales pitch or audit as an individualised task, learning can be deepened through
entrepreneurial facilitation (see section 5), following a presentation to the group.

1. What is Use of Ice breakers?
It is an informal exercise designed to create interaction between participants, “warm them up”
(as the name implies) to the activities of the day and learn about each other. It can also enable
participants to harvest from each other the experience that already exists in a group of the issues
to be addressed in a learning programme. It is most often used at the beginning of a programme
to replace the process of participants introducing each other more formally (which can be a long
and repetitive exercise, which doesn’t allow people to interact).

How is the exercise constructed?
Any game or exercise involving mobility and informal interaction could be classified as an icebreaker. Examples include Speed Networking (see separate pedagogic guide – speed
networking), participants interviewing each other and then interviewing, then introducing their
counterpart, preferably in an innovative and amusing manner. There can be ‘rules’ applied; in
that you can structure the areas they need to focus upon, or as facilitator, you can set
parameters, such as how many things they need to find out or number of things that each person
may report on (as an introduction about another).
The exercise can be constructed to fit any programme. The exercise can involve each participant
being given a set of papers with boxes to fill in on the basis of exchanges with other participants.
The boxes are designed to cover key areas of experience relevant to the learning programme - for
an academic development programme (staff development) this could include the experience of
participants in teaching to certain key outcomes in the NCGE Template.
in a student entrepreneurship programme it can be used to harvest evidence of participant
entrepreneurial behaviour (identified and taken an opportunity; been committed to see
something through (project); failed in something but tried again; solved a problem creatively;
planned and carried out an event under pressure; sold an idea to someone, etc). Most people
have some experience of these things which they can share easily within new colleagues.
The exercise is commonly undertaken under time pressure. The exchange of experience allowed
between any two participants is deliberately limited to force participants to move around.

3.

Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is designed to: facilitate networking, the harvesting of information and its
codification under pressure. It can also create confidence by a process of realisation of existing
experience and informal benchmarking against other participants in a programme. It also creates
a competitive but non-threatening atmosphere.

4.

Outcomes
Participants informally endorsed via practice of some of the key components of a programme.
They also realise that it is relevant to them personally, and that they and others have relevant
experience to input into the programme.

<-----Page 31----->4. Use of External Speakers/Presenters or Evaluators
1. What is Use of External Speakers/Presenters/Evaluators?
External speakers/presenters are used in enterprise/entrepreneurship programmes for a number
of purposes:

to provide role models of entrepreneurs –‘what’s it really like’

to provide a ‘real life case’ of how to confront/deal with a particular problem or
issue

to more formally teach a ‘how to’ part of entrepreneurial management

to act as a sounding board/evaluator for a piece of work or proposal

to present what their institution/organisation does (or a certain aspect of its work)

to give a view on a general issue of relevance to a programme

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Often the answer to this question is ‘very badly’. The common reasons for this are:








lack of clarity of the role to be played (as set out above, aligned with learning
outcomes)
inadequate briefing of the ‘external’ (learning outcomes)
inadequate briefing of the students/audience
inadequate management of the learning experience
a resultant deterioration of the session into ‘personality/ego’ stories
an inability to relate the session to concepts or generalisation about good or bad
practice
inappropriate frames of reference agreed/used for evaluation/mentoring

The construction of the external interface is therefore extremely important.
Careful
establishment of the goals of the external/internal interface is key – in particular of learning
goals. If, for example, a ‘new young entrepreneur’ is invited as a ‘speaker’ there is a range of
possible objectives, all of which it is desirable to spell out upfront. These include: demonstrating
clearly the motivations and drivers to self-employment; establishing how one finds and evaluates
an idea; demonstrating how one copes with changes in the life-world associated with being an
entrepreneur, among many others. One enterprising way of structuring outcomes in this way is
not to overly brief the invitee but to set up an interview panel or panels of programme
participants (each one dealing with a different issue). Their task is to draw out the relevant
experiences of the participants.
Another method of improving the management of external contributions is to precede the
presentation/interview with an analysis of an issue leading to the development of a frame of
reference against which the programme participants can evaluate the external contribution.
For example, where an external is being invited to demonstrate how they approach a particular
problem/issue (evaluating a business plan) the class are thoroughly briefed as to the process
which presents them with a frame for evaluating/questioning the contribution of the external).
Where externals are being used as evaluators – for example of a project or proposal – initial
briefing and agreement of frames of reference and process is important. Where externals are
used as teachers, then initial training is important or should be supported by staff in a joint
approach.

32

<-----Page 32----->3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The aim is to engage with the ‘real world’ in order to provide feelings of ‘what it is like’ to do
things and experience things in practice. It is therefore a simulation of tacit learning but to be
successful, it must leave the participants with an ‘emotional’ understanding of the learning input
and a heuristic framework against which they can judge future events.

4. Outcomes
Participants have a real ‘feel’ for the practice of the real world. They have a bridge between
concept and practice and they understand the drift between concept and practice. They
understand better the way in which entrepreneurial decisions are made.

33

<-----Page 33----->5. Use of Drama
1. What is Use of Drama?
It is the creation and performance by an individual or group of an incident, scenario or sequence
of events designed to portray the emotional and relationship as well as cognitive aspects of the
scene. Its use can serve a number of purposes:











It is a reminder that no information received from interviews and research approaches (no
matter how good the checklist) is truly objective. The results always reflect the values and
beliefs of the person interviewed and often their recent experiences and emotions. For
example, a person who has recently been convicted by police of a speeding traffic offence
will have a different response to questions about the role and value of the police force in
general than someone who has just been saved by the police from an assault. A dramatic
presentation of interviews will demand interpretation of the emotions behind the
message.
It demands of the creators of the drama that they must put themselves ‘in the shoes’ of
the provider of information and see the results from their point of view. The conventional
academic process of data collection often makes little or no demand upon understanding
the data from the providers’ point of view.
Drama demands that individual characters in the drama are understood through the eyes
of the other characters. The dramatist makes the character believable by portraying
him/her through the eyes of other characters in the drama.
Messages and information delivered in innovative ways will make a bigger impact and can
create wider understanding. Entrepreneurs often need to use creative ways of delivering
messages. TV advertising is, for example, drama. A presentation can be dramatic to make
an impact.
Drama provides training in acting skills, which build confidence and ability to personally
project.
Developing a drama demands the use of creative ability – often the need is to develop a
metaphor to enhance the impact of a message or indeed generalise it.
Developing drama in groups also creates a powerful bonding process.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Use of drama can take a number of forms including Role Play and Hot Seating, which are the
subject of separate Pedagogical Notes (18 & 8). Participants can be asked, in small groups, to
create a scene portraying a single message, often through metaphor. For example, in the
entrepreneurship context they can be asked to prepare a short scene portraying one of a number
of entrepreneurial behaviours or attributes e.g. entrepreneurial risk taking; opportunity
identification; initiative taking; strong sense of autonomy; networking; learning by doing, and so
on. The ‘audience’ of other participants is then invited to guess the message, to score the
creativity of the metaphor and the degree of entertainment delivered.

The drama can also be constructed around a piece of research – for example, in the context of
dramatising a series of interviews as a method of enhancing insight into the results of formal data
collection. In this case the key issues arising from the research are discussed in a group and the
messages to be delivered are set out. A metaphor is then created and dramatised under
guidance and later performed. The audience is then asked to record the key messages of the
drama and to score the presentation for creativity and entertainment.
34

<-----Page 34----->3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Entrepreneurs need to be able to act out different roles in different situations. A good
entrepreneur is a good actor. In building relationships with different stakeholders the
entrepreneur will need to act out different roles – with a banker, venture capitalist, government
official, employee, regulator, customer and so on. It is a key essence of entrepreneurship to see
oneself through the eyes of major stakeholders. As well as building personal confidence there is
a strong emphasis upon being creative under pressure, making collective decisions rapidly and
working together as a team.

4. Outcomes
Participants gain understanding of the emotional aspects of knowledge and how difficult it is to
be truly objective. They understand the importance of gaining empathy and insight into the
passions, emotions and contexts of situations. They learn about the process of consolidation of
ideas and of the importance of presenting these creatively but in a form that that will be easily
understood.

35

<-----Page 35----->6. Use of Debate
1. What is Use of Debate?
Debate is used to provide a forum for delivery of argument for and against an issue. It provides a
platform for exploring all relevant issues. It also is a vehicle for practicing delivery skills and
‘thinking on one’s feet’. It also has to have audience appeal as the aim is to win their vote but
also involve them.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
A debate can be formal or informal. It is relatively easy to construct an issue for argument with a
class, get them to consider arguments for or against and then speak to it from the ‘floor’.
A more formal version is described below (however it is possible just to work at an informal level,
having established 2 sides for the debate and defined roles 1-3 below).
Traditionally, a debate will have a ‘Motion’ (statement) which the ‘House’ (those attending) must
address. For example, ‘This House believes that entrepreneurs are ‘born not made’ or ‘This
House believes that entrepreneurial management can only be fully pursued in the independent
business organisation’.
The debate will need: (indicative timings included for an hour session)
1. A Chairperson: who will introduce the Motion and the Proposers, Opposers and ‘Summers
up’? The Chair also sets out the rules of the game, the time limits and how he/she will
enforce these and how the audience should contribute. A chair will explain the vote and
how this will be for the best arguments best delivered not the audience’s personal
preference (as more reflective of the learning gained, rather than opinion at the time).
2. A Proposer: to put up all the major positive arguments for the Motion {7 minutes}
3. An Oppose: -to put all the main arguments against the Motion {7 minutes}
4. A Seconded for the Motion: to counter the arguments of the Oppose as they have been
anticipated and as they occur in reality. Also to back up and add arguments to those of the
Proposer {5 minutes}
5. A Seconded against the Motion: to counter all the arguments of the Proposer and Seconded
for the Motion as they have been anticipated and as they occur in practice and to back up
the opposition arguments {5 minutes}
6. Speakers from the floor (the audience) to think of their own views and articulate them.
Speakers do not ask questions but make points and arguments. They may of course take up
what has been said by the speakers. In a small audience it should be emphasised that every
member has to contribute
7. A Summariser for the Motion: to summarise up the debate after the audience has
contributed, using the key audience contributions, and emphatically inviting the audience to
support the Motion {5 minutes}
8. A Summariser against the Motion: to summarise up the debate after the audience has
contributed, using the audience contributions that support their argument, and emphatically
inviting the audience to oppose the Motion {5 minutes}

All speakers should not read from notes but should address the audience warmly and
convincingly and should use humour sufficiently to entertain.
The sequence is as follows:
36

To engage all the participants in the debate it can be organised as follows:





Divide the class into 6 groups
Group 1 has to agree the main points for the Motion, make suggestions as to
innovative/entertaining arguments and choose a speaker
Group 2 has to agree the major points against the Motion, make suggestions for
innovative/entertaining arguments and choose a speaker
Group 3 has to brainstorm on the arguments that might be put by the opposition, think
of counterpoints and ways of refuting them entertainingly and subsidiary points to
reinforce the Motion. They then choose a speaker to second the Motion.
Group 4 has to brainstorm on the arguments that might be presented by the proposers
of the Motion and also how the points against might be attacked and choose a speaker
to second the opposition to the Motion.
Group 5 has to brainstorm on what they think will be the main points for and against
(including any possible points from the floor). They then prepare an outline summary of
the argument for supporting the motion and refuting the opposition. They then choose a
speaker who has however to be prepared to build flexibly upon what goes on in the
debate
Group 6 goes through the same procedure as Group 5 except that they prepare an
outline summary of the arguments for opposing the Motion and refuting proposition
arguments. They then choose a speaker who has however to be prepared to build
flexibly upon what goes on in the debate.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The ability to think and speak on one’s feet is tested and in particular the ability to have empathy
with the alternative point of view. This also tests the capacity to argue and present a case in a
flexible and innovative manner. Critically, it is a vehicle for exploring key issues in
entrepreneurship development which creates group cohesion, bonding and fun.

4. Outcomes
Major outcomes to be targeted are the airing of key issues in entrepreneurship development via
an innovative format. Participants can also apply their more formal learning in a flexible and
demanding context and building a team spirit is also a key component, within a cohort.

37

<-----Page 37----->7. Use of Drawing
1. What is Use of Drawing?
This is essentially the transmission of ideas into pictures. It is used to stimulate participants in a
programme to express themselves and their ideas in a pictorial form, often with the use of
metaphor. It then stands as a basis for discussion of participant ideas and concepts.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Programme participants are asked, usually in groups, to discuss the meaning of a concept or an
event. They are asked to portray this in pictorial form as a basis for presentation and discussion
with other participants.
An example:
 The object of the session is to explore the concept of enterprise culture. The aim is to
begin with an exploration of what this means to the participants and to explore
whether there is a shared concept
 The class is divided into small groups and each group is given pens and a flip chart sheet.
The group are asked to ‘discover’ their own meaning for enterprise culture and to write
down what they see as the key components
 The group is then asked to draw a picture which they believe encapsulates the meaning
of enterprise culture
 The picture is then shown to the rest of the class and the class are asked to describe
what it means to them
 This is then compared with the meaning that the group was trying to portray and the
group are asked to explain this to other participants
 The facilitator notes all the meanings given and attempts to pull these together for
discussion of the concept and why it was given different meanings. Academic concepts
and research work can be introduced to build wider understanding (and credit can be
awarded for its inclusion).
The approach can be used in a number of ways but most importantly to test understanding after
readings and discussion and, to harvest pre-conceived views and attitudes relating to a subject as
a basis for discussion.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise aims to stimulate creative expression. It also is designed to give ownership of
learning to participants by creating discussion on the basis of their existing knowledge and ideas.

4. Outcomes
A strong basis for mutual understanding is created. A sense of ownership is given and
participation in learning is maximised. The power of visual presentation is demonstrated.

38

<-----Page 38----->8. Use of Hot Seats
1. What is Use of Hot Seats?
This is a group exercise. Members of the group in turn are put in the ‘Hot Seat’ to respond to
intensive questioning from other group members. Traditionally, this ‘Hot Seating’ technique is
used by actors to help them identify with the character they are playing. It is used in
entrepreneurship education to enable participants to get inside the culture and values of
stakeholders with whom they might have to deal. But it can also be used for intensive
questioning of an individual’s own personal aims, objectives and plans including business plans.
Other participant’s (the group) act as interrogators in this exercise; note: it can be useful to agree
ground rules as what is appropriate in terms of questioning and approach within this task.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The hot seat itself is in the middle of a semi-circle of chairs. The person in the ‘Hot Seat’ can be
himself/herself or represent a client or stakeholder. Dependent upon the role, questions fired
rapidly may relate to personal issues; business/organisational problems or community activities
(part of ground rules).
Example Hot Seat: Business/plan/idea
The individual is surrounded by those role playing different stakeholders which the plan might
need to convince. The aim is to create recognition that the plan will be seen very differently by
very different stakeholders. Interrogators may, for example, play the roles of bankers, venture
capitalists, family, local government officials offering grants; a potential large customer who will
be judging whether to include the client on a buying list or a major potential supplier who may be
asked for credit.
Other participants can then be similarly hot seated. At the end of the hot seating there can be a
review of what has been learned about the business plan as a relationship management
instrument and how it might be best developed to meet different needs.
Example Hot Seat: different stakeholders
Using the same focus of the business plan; hot seater’s, in turn, can be asked to play the roles of
different stakeholders, as above, and are quizzed about what they are looking for and why?
Example Hot Seating on a problem
The technique can be used to role-play individuals from a case study with the aim of creating
lively personalised discussion of major points for learning from the case. It can also be used to
focus discussion on how to deal with a particular problem set out in a simple brief.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
This is an exercise in thinking and responding under pressure. It also is designed to stimulate
understanding of relationship management and the value of thinking empathetically. It can be
used to throw light on the ‘organisational cultures’ of different stakeholders that make them see
the same things in different ways.

4. Outcomes
39

<-----Page 39----->Participants gain confidence in responding to questioning under pressure. They may importantly
also learn that they need to ‘act’ differently with different stakeholders. They learn quickly to
adapt to others’ point of view.

40

<-----Page 40----->9. Use of Speed-Networking
1. What is Use of Speed-Networking?
It is an informal exercise designed to create interaction between participants, warm them up (as
the name implies) and learn about each other. Speed-Networking can be used to encourage
networking at an event or it can be used in teaching and learning as an ice-breaker (see earlier
note 3). It is most often used during the early stages of a programme to replace the process of
participants introducing each other more formally.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
In speed networking, participants are lined up in two lines facing each other; they are invited to
spend 30 seconds to 1 minute each introducing themselves to each other. Usually a whistle or
some other loud device is used to indicate that the time is up (as this exercise is quite noisy!).
When the time is complete one line moves along so that they are facing a new person and the
introductions start again. Typically the speed-networking exercise may be conducted for 20-30
minutes. A longer period of time is not recommended as it can be tiring for participants.
The exercise can be constructed to fit any programme or event. For example in student
entrepreneurship programmes it can be used to get students to introduce each other before
group work or before choosing groups for an experiential exercise (e.g. business planning). The
exercise is commonly undertaken under time pressure. The exchange of experience allowed
between any two participants is deliberately limited to encourage a focused summary of the
person introducing themselves.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is designed to facilitate networking and enable people to get a basic knowledge of
each other in a short period of time. It is usually a fun exercise so it works well in ice-breaking
and it ensures that participants talk to a large number of other people.

4. Outcomes
Participants get to know each other more, they break down barriers and it enables the beginning
of trust to emerge between participants. Usually they meet somebody who they may not have
otherwise met and sometimes these individuals assist their learning on the programme more as a
consequence of social barriers being removed.

41

<-----Page 41----->10. Use of an Elevator Pitch
1. What is Use of an Elevator Pitch?
An Elevator Pitch (or Elevator Speech) is a brief overview of an idea for a product, service, or
project. The pitch is so called because it can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride
(say, thirty seconds or 100-150 words). The term is typically used in the context of an
entrepreneur pitching an idea to a venture capitalist to receive funding. Venture capitalists often
judge the quality of an idea and team on the basis of the quality of its elevator pitch, and will ask
entrepreneurs for the elevator pitch to quickly weed out bad ideas.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
In the entrepreneurship educators programme the elevator pitch is used to force participants to
think carefully about their personal strengths and to be confident about these by making an
explicit pitch. Within the entrepreneurship educators programme it is used to give participants
experience of an elevator pitch. The basic approach is to invite individuals to develop their pitch
beforehand with a strict time limit (usually 1 to 3 minutes). Participants are asked to compete in
front of a panel of judges equipped with agreed judging criteria. Participants are lined up to
encourage swift movement from one participant to another and they are timed – a whistle is
blown at the end of the time and they must then depart.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Elevator Pitches are commonly used in US Enterprise Education and are often used in business
plan competitions. The purpose is to force students to prepare a short and focused explanation
of their business should they have the opportunity to pitch it to somebody in an informal
situation. It is an encouragement to think out the core of the business and find attractive ways of
putting it over.

4. Outcomes
The main benefits of the approach are to enable students to pick up the skills to summarise
something in a focused and precise way. The outcome is often that they are aware how
important lucky opportunities can be in entrepreneurship and to prepare for such opportunities
should they occur.

<-----Page 42----->11. Use of Revolving Tables
1. What is Use of Networking Techniques – Revolving Tables?
The networking technique of Revolving Tables involves asking people during a dinner (or indeed
any teaching course where the tables are in cabaret style) to change tables between courses or
between sessions in a teaching and learning programme. It is designed to maximise the number
of people that a person may meet at a networking or learning event.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
A formal networking technique of revolving tables can be used between courses to enable
participants to meet other participants and to enable them to informally talk and interview the
invited guests and contributors. Participants were given a focused question or challenge – such
as, to find out how start up is supported and promoted by the invited guests’ institutions and
organisations and to explore any challenges that they encounter. The technique is principally an
informal one that is designed to develop informal discourse between participants.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Revolving Tables might be used in a range of contexts – it is very effective in situations where
networking needs to be facilitated, such as breakfast clubs or other events. It can be used in
entrepreneurial learning within the University as an ice-breaker or as a method to encourage
inter-group engagement in an experiential project where groups need to work together.

4. Outcomes
The outcomes achieved will somewhat depend on the use of the technique – it can be used to
help students develop their informal conversation skills and help them learn how to network. In
such networking situations, it can help people mix more than they would normally and is
effective at encouraging informal conversations, which can lead to business opportunities.

43

<-----Page 43----->12. Use of Brainstorming Using Post-its
1. What is Use of Brainstorming Using Post-its?
The basis of brainstorming is generating ideas in a group situation based on the principle of
suspending judgment to release ideas - a principle which can be highly productive in individual
effort as well as group effort. The key to effective brainstorming is that the generation phase is
separate from the judgment phase of thinking. Brainstorming has many forms but is usually
conducted in groups with specific rules being applied: no-judging ideas; aim for a large quantity
of ideas; permission to use piggy-backing of others ideas and freewheeling (be as abstract as
possible).

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Within an entrepreneurship educators programme a loose form of brainstorming was used using
post-it notes.
Agree the guidelines for effective group brain storming, as below:






There is no right and wrong
Do not judge ideas
Be outrageous or ambitious
Do not rule out ideas because of practicalities at this stage
Two heads are better than one!

Participants were asked to think about as many ‘learning needs’ and ‘learning offers’ as they
could and attach these to appropriate NCGE learning outcomes. This was the brainstorming part
of the exercise. These ideas were collected into themes by the use of the outcomes framework.
In the second stage of the exercise participants were asked to take one learning outcome and
sort the ideas into categories. In this stage they were organising the ideas. In the final stage
they were asked to link categories together. This stage was a form of conceptualisation – seeing
how the different categories link to each other.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise can be constructed in many brainstorming situations. It is particularly valuable
when you want to get thoughts from participants and to organise them in a sophisticated way. In
a student situation it could be used to explore attitudes and expectations about
entrepreneurship. It can also be used to conduct analysis of business ideas.
4. Outcomes
The main benefit of the approach is for a combined perspective from participants in relation to a
particular theme. This holistic view enables participants to be more aware of the wider picture.
It is also very effective at demonstrating expectations and views across a group. The
categorisation also makes explicit participants’ frames of reference.

<-----Page 44----->13. Use of Panels
1. What is Use of Panels?
A Panel is a means of fronting a debate or forming the basis for a process of questioning or
collecting opinion/experience on certain issues, problems or opportunities. The Panel may be
composed of ‘externals’ or may be used as an internal ‘review’ group for a particular issue. It is
often also used as an alternative to inviting presentations from external speakers.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Panels are often misused in that they become a vehicle for a series of speeches by panel
members in response to a number of questions asked by the chair or harvested from the
audience; however panels can be used in different ways.
The ‘Expert Panel’ is used to provide comment on a particular issue about which the panel have
relevant experience. Here, the optimum format is where the panel very briefly addresses
questions from the audience collected either beforehand or spontaneously. Engagement of the
audience in the debate is important. The chairperson’s role in stimulating audience participation,
provoking cross-panel debate, keeping comments short, summarising and ensuring that the
debate is to the point is critical. The panel should be carefully chosen to bring different
perspectives to the theme. For example in debating issues concerning the ‘entrepreneurial
university’, a panel might have a Vice Chancellor, an articulate student perhaps representing a
student body, an entrepreneur with some experience of interacting with a university, a
representative of a regional development authority or local government and someone from the
Department of Education.
An Expert Panel can also be used with small groups to evaluate or comment upon the ideas,
proposals and plans of participants.
Participant Panels can be formed to role-play stakeholders or simply to comment upon the work
of other participants, individual or groups; for example, to advice on marketing plans.
A Representative Panel, for example, a small group of entrepreneurs from a particular sector, or a
group sharing a common environment or experience (for example all having taken up external
equity) can be used to explore the experience via a process of questioning by participants (often
after briefing from programme input).

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The emphasis is upon exposure to tacit learning, enabling assessment of ‘how things are seen and
done’ in the world of practice. If chaired properly it can also provide a strong measure of learning
by interaction. It can also provide a vehicle for testing out concepts in practice.

4. Outcomes
Ideas are stimulated by exposure to experience. The animation arising from this approach
creates stimulation to the affective and co native aspects of learning. Contacts are made and
barriers to external relationship development are broken down.

45

<-----Page 45----->14. Use of Critical Incidents
1. What is Use of Critical Incidents?
The Critical Incident is a short description of a situation that will be used as a basis for focused
group discussion. The description will be in the form of a single PowerPoint slide or one page (or
less) handout capable of being instantly read and digested. It will end with a question to the
group as the basis for discussion. The discussion may be full class or small group. A critical
incident is often preferred to a longer case as it provides immediate stimulus. A longer case can,
however, be taught as a series of incidents.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The incident is prepared before the session by the facilitator. Examples might be as follows.
Example 1:
Aim: to stimulate group discussion of the life world of the entrepreneur.
Key Question for Focus: What changes in one’s ‘way of life’ when one moves from employment
to self employment?
Kate is a young single woman of 25 years of age. She graduated from University two years ago
with good degree in design – focused upon ceramics. She had always had a considerable talent
for art and design demonstrated from an early age. She had worked herself up the educational
ladder in creative design by successful progress through further education, then to a University.
Upon graduating she took a post at a school teaching ceramics but soon decided that this life was
not for her. She wanted more independence. With the help of a small legacy from her
grandmother she set up her own studio, complete with kiln and embarked on a career in self
employment.
What changed in her life-world as a result of this move?
The facilitator can draw from the group a list of changes which can be used for discussion of the
nature of uncertainties and complexities facing the entrepreneur and the skills and attributes
that might be needed to deal with them.
Example 2:
Aim: to stimulate discussion of how to cope with change in a business development context
Key Question for focus: How well is the business geared up to cope with an acquisition?
Company Z is a family business with 80 employees operating in the steel stockholding business.
It is highly successful. In an industry dominated by large companies, with an extensive stock
ranges, it has managed to carve out a niche for itself. It focuses upon a few large customers, for
whom it offers a special service, and a range of small firms located within a 150 km radius. The
CEO and owner is an accountant and the company is carefully managed. It is among the top
performing firms in the industry and is well recognised. The owner is President of the National
Stockholders Association. The company is cash rich and looking for expansion. One of its
customers is a small manufacturing company located within 1 km distance. This company makes
hatch doors for cargo vessels and for bulk rail transport carriers. The company is in difficulty and
its owners want to quit. The management team at Company Z think this a great opportunity to
diversify and sets out to acquire the manufacturer at a bargain price

46

<-----Page 46----->How well does the experience of the company equip it for success in taking on this new
acquisition?
The facilitator uses the Incident to create a framework for reviewing the quality and nature of the
intangible assets of this well run company and to demonstrate that many of these do not prepare
it for a proposed substantial shift in the task environment. The incident can therefore lead into
discussion of contingent theories of entrepreneurial organisation design.
It should be clear from the above that an educator can without great difficulty create a focus for
discussion with very little effort in preparation.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The technique stimulates creative thinking in the group. It places the pressure for knowledge
creation upon the participants and brings out and encourages sharing of previously tacit
knowledge internalised. Essentially the critical incident technique is a vehicle for drawing out
what participants already know.

4. Outcomes
Participants own the learning and the frameworks created by this process and therefore are
more likely to internalise the knowledge gained.

47

<-----Page 47----->15. Use of Organisations as Networks
1. What is Use of Organisations as Networks?
All organisations can be described in terms of networks of relationships. Independent business
management, for example, can be characterised as a process of managing interdependency with
a range of stakeholders (customers, suppliers, financiers, professional services, staff, family,
competitors and so on). The same concept can be applied to all organisations. The aim of this
pedagogical exercise is to get participants to see new ventures as a process of negotiation with all
key stakeholders.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants are given an event to organise, preferably one that involves some risk and
uncertainty. This can be a business, social enterprise and other (public) activity. They are first
asked to identify all the stakeholders, internal and external, who will impact on the success or
otherwise of the venture. They are then, using empathy, asked to personalise the key players as
far as possible and identify attitudes towards the venture. In particular they are asked to
identify:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

the nature of the interest of the stakeholder in the venture;
the benefits to the stakeholder that will be recognised and unrecognised;
what exactly they want from the stakeholder;
the reasons why the stakeholder might buy into the venture;
why they might oppose it; and the importance of the support or otherwise of the
stakeholder to the success of the venture.

Having done this for key stakeholders participants are then asked to:
1. assess who might be most supportive of the project and who will be most negative;
2. consider the relationships between the stakeholders if any;
3. identify who among the probable supporters might be used to influence those who have
reservations or are likely to oppose.
Finally the exercise can be carried forward in reality – if it is a real venture – or by a process of
simulation and role play. Strategies for negotiation are developed and played out, providing
consideration of use of different forms of communication.
Among examples that can be used are: the organisation of a local pop concert for charity; the
development of a social enterprise focused upon providing disadvantaged women with families
with a greater capacity to find employment or a conventional business start up.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The emphasis is upon relationship learning and education of stakeholders and the development
of trust-based relationships. The focus is upon doing things through people.

48

<-----Page 48----->4. Outcomes
There will be enhanced capacities to: see all ventures as sets of relationships to be developed;
build trust based relationships; develop strategies to build effective networks: and use
negotiation skills.

49

<-----Page 49----->16. Use of Empathy in Communication Exercises (with Entrepreneurs)
1. What is Use of Empathy in Communication Exercises?
The objective is to sensitise participants to the need for different forms of communication with
different audiences or interest groups, and to develop capacity to use this skill. In particular,
emphasis is placed upon the ‘ways of communicating’ of entrepreneurs, informally, within
constraints (word limit) and on a need-to-know and know-how basis.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
This can be approached in a number of ways, including by an exercise in writing for different
kinds of audiences.
To commence this exercise, participants, organised in small groups, can be given a copy of an
article from a ‘broadsheet’ newspaper (in the UK, this would be the Times or Guardian) and then
an article on the same subject from a ‘tabloid’ (in the UK these would be The Sun or The Mirror).
They are asked to analyse the differences. They can then be asked to write a short piece
reporting an incident or covering an issue of relevance to the group in the language of the
broadsheet (the Times) and then the tabloid (the Sun newspaper). The end discussion might
focus upon the importance of considering the different ‘word counts’ and processes of
communication for different audiences and discussion of the relevance of this for the
participants.
An example focused upon reaching independent business owners might be that of designing a
brochure to promote a programme on financial management for small firms. Participants might
be asked to speculate on the different needs of different groups of firms at different stages and
invited to consider ways of segmentation of the ‘market. Particular attention will be paid to the
educational/qualification background and the kinds of newspapers they might read. They might
then brainstorm on the particular ‘needs to know’ (key knowledge and facts) and ‘know how’
needs of this group. What problems are they likely to have in the field of financial management
and what opportunities for development might they face where financial skills might be needed?
What barriers might there be to owners of the ‘type’ identified have to attending the programme
and how does that affect the communication? Bearing the above in mind the brochure will be
written and may be appraised by different groups.
Another example is organising and selling a briefing workshop to local entrepreneurs for the
above programme, in particular, covering forms of verbal and written communication relating to
processes of; attracting entrepreneurs to the workshop; creating the right environment for
communication when they arrive; forms and content of presentations/discussions designed to
excite and create interest; and methods of ‘sealing the deal’.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus is upon the art of communication and engagement with different audiences, a key
component in the process of creating affectivity and co nativity in entrepreneurial learning
processes.

4. Outcomes

50

<-----Page 50----->This will result in an enhanced capacity to build promotional and learning relationships with
different groups of participants and also an associated ability to communicate on a Know-How
and Need-to-Know basis with small firms.

51

<-----Page 51----->17. Use of Shadowing
1. What is Use of Shadowing?
Shadowing, as the term implies, is following and tracing the activity and footsteps of a person
over a period of time, from days to weeks. In the entrepreneurial context it means undertaking
this in a certain way with a certain set of objectives rather than just ‘learning the job’ – a context
within which it is commonly used. The major objective, in the context of entrepreneurial
learning, is to gain insight into entrepreneurial ways of doing things.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
To be most effective it is best constructed around the shadowed being given a discrete set of
tasks focusing upon a carefully chosen aspect of ‘ways of doing things’. If the ‘shadowing’ is with
the entrepreneur, then it should be developed in such a way to be directly of value to the person
shadowed in terms of feedback. This will also help with the process of gaining access and
permission from the entrepreneur.
Example: Shadowing of the entrepreneur for one week by a student.
An arrangement is made for the student to be with the entrepreneur all the time he/she is at
work. The student may also ask to have a morning debrief with the entrepreneur as to any
business-related activity carried out ‘after hours’. The focus of the exercise of value to the
entrepreneur is two-fold:



- to analyse the use of time over the period
- to analyse the forms of communication used

The results will be fed back to the entrepreneur
To meet the objectives the student measures the time of the entrepreneur in different locations,
both internal and external to the workplace. The time may also be measured in terms of time
allocated to different activities/problems/issues. Example time spent in briefing staff, time spent
with clients, time on administration, time with suppliers etc.
Communication analysis exercises can be extremely useful. In this case the student begins with a
categorisation list in terms of a series of headings in an exercise book. Categories will include:




Form of communication (oral direct, telephone, internet, written)
Location of communication (office, workplace elsewhere, external)
Area of business – main focus of communication – marketing, supply, finance, operations,
human resource/personnel etc
 Proactive – reactive/planned-unplanned
Analysis can be fed back to the entrepreneur enabling him/her to address an issue that is almost
always of importance, namely time pressure and management.
The above example underlines the importance of focus in shadowing and of ensuring utility to
the entrepreneur.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning

52

<-----Page 52----->The focus is upon the real community of practice and the creation of empathy. There is also a
strong emphasis upon the use of knowledge to the entrepreneur.

4. Outcomes
Participants will gain substantial understanding of entrepreneurial ways of communicating and
doing things. They will also gain insight into what will interest entrepreneurs and what they will
‘buy into’, a key issue in designing services to entrepreneurs.

53

<-----Page 53----->18. Use of Role Play
1. What is Use of Role Play?
The central aim is to put participants in the role of predetermined persons with whom they seek
to gain empathy. The role player is challenged to match all the known characteristics and
knowledge base of the chosen person. The player is confronted by one or more persons either
playing other roles or by other participants questioning the chosen role-played character.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
It can be constructed in a wide variety of ways. Within a business context, for example
 exploring the way in which different organisations view a business proposal, individuals
can role play venture capital personnel, angels, bankers, public authority grant givers or
large firms offering financial support to small?
 playing the role of a large company buyer interviewing a small business seeking to get
onto the company’s central procurement list
 conducting a selling exercise with a potential buyer of a product or service
 conducting an interview for a job (see below)

Example of Role Play – Job Interview
During this exercise participants are given the opportunity to put into practice what they have up
learned about the behaviour of an entrepreneurial person. The aim is to enhance the capacity of
participants to internalise and apply concepts of the entrepreneurial person.
For the purpose of this exercise participants are organised in groups of three. One member of
the group acts as the interviewer, one as the interviewee and one as an observer. Separate
instructions are given to each person.
Two rounds are played – with separate instructions for each. Different individuals play different
roles during the two rounds.

Round 1
Instruction for Observer
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee.
After the interview you will report back on the entrepreneurial potential observed.
Use the checklist of entrepreneurial behaviour and attitudes as the guideline for observation and
reporting.

Instruction for Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for a position as Marketing Manager in your organisation which
is a franchise organisation for “quick print”. You are the original entrepreneur behind the
franchise concept with, at least in your view, a great deal of success behind you. In your own
perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long term. You compete with your
own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.
The person you are looking for should be somebody with a great deal of entrepreneurial ability
harnessed into a striving also to get co-operation from franchisees and other staff.

54

<-----Page 54----->Instructions for Interviewee
You are to be interviewed for a position as Marketing Manager in a ‘quick print’ franchise. You
are not particularly interested in the position. Your previous experience has been in the financial
function. In applying for this position you are really taking a chance as the salary is a great deal
higher than your present income. You are also interested in the perks and the possibility to travel
extensively and use an expense account, something you have never had before.
Your
qualifications are good but all on the accounting and finance field. You are basically looking for a
position where you can quickly make a great deal of money.

Round 2
The group exchange roles with slightly different instructions

Instructions for Observer
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee. After the
interview you will report back on the behaviour observed in term of entrepreneurial
characteristics.
Use the checklist of entrepreneurial behaviour and attitudes as the guideline for observation and
reporting.

Instruction for Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for a position as Marketing Manager in your organisation which
is a franchise organisation for ‘quick print’. You are the original entrepreneur behind the
franchise concept with, at least in your view, a great deal of success behind you. In your own
perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long term. You compete with your
own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.
The person you are looking for should be somebody with a great deal of entrepreneurial ability
harnessed into a striving also to get co-operation from franchisees and other staff.

Instructions for Interviewee
You are to display as much entrepreneurial orientation and behaviour as possible during the
interview. You are anxious to get the job because it is a logical step in your career and presents a
great personal challenge.
You are a marketing specialist. The job you are applying for is with a franchise organisation in the
field of printing. The job is described as that of a ‘marketing manager’. You are not sure what
the job entails although it is clear that, as far as salary is concerned, the job means a step forward
in your career.
In this exercise the role play allows practice at using a framework for assessment of
entrepreneurial potential in a conventional job context. The juxtaposition of two different types
of interviewee provides the basis for strengthening the analysis post-exercise.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
This is learning by doing involving the practice in use of concepts learned. Creativity and flair in
acting out roles is encouraged. The whole exercise is dependent upon the use of empathy. The
role played demands imagination as to the characters portrayed.

55

<-----Page 55----->4. Outcomes
Participants will have a strong frame of reference for use in analysis of entrepreneurial
behaviour. They will also have greater confidence and ability in articulating the views of others.

56

<-----Page 56----->19. Use of Frames of Reference for Intuitive Decision making
1. What is Use of frames of reference for Intuitive Decision Making?
A frame of reference in the context of entrepreneurial learning is a ‘mind map’ used for
exploration of a particular phenomenon. In the context of entrepreneurial learning such maps,
are the products of experience, enabling the entrepreneur to make rapid, seemingly intuitive,
judgements.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The exercise is dependent upon the construction of a frame of reference by participants through
which a particular event might be analysed and decisions made. Such a frame may be
constructed by a process of brainstorming facilitated by the educator without any prior
knowledge input – to test how participants see things and to encourage them to combine existing
knowledge. Alternatively, following a knowledge input, for example, on assessing customer
potential, participants are asked to construct a frame for analysis.
1. Example 1: Creating a frame for assessing a business proposition.
Participants are asked – without any input – ‘If I (the facilitator) came to you for advice about
starting a business, what kinds of questions would you ask me?’
Participants can be divided into groups for this exercise.
After 20 minutes the various views are fed back and the facilitator groups and creates out of the
replies the reference of:
IDEA

ABILITY

RESOURCE

MOTIVATION

ADMINISTRATION

PLAN

Within this frame the various feedbacks is accumulated so that the headings in the frame are
filled out. The frame can then be reinforced in use by application to the participants if they are a
start up group, applied to a case or used as a basis for interviewing a simulated or real start up.
2. Example 2: Creating a frame for business analysis on the basis of knowledge input.
Participants are asked to imagine that they are going to visit a small/medium sized firm for half a
day. They are asked the question: What would you look for during the visit in order to determine
whether the firm had a strong strategic orientation?
The question is asked in the knowledge that the participants have earlier undertaken a
programme focused upon strategy.
Participants can be divided into groups for this question or the issue can be openly brainstormed
in class.

57

<-----Page 57----->As in the above example the answers can be collated into a frame – or the participants can be
asked to suggest a frame within which they might logically place observations. The end result
might be a frame, as below.
VISION AND DEGREE SHARED
PLANNED CAPACITY
TO IMPLEMENT VISION

STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL
SCANNING

ABILITY TO SEE BUSINESS
THROUGH STAKEHOLDER
EYES

CAPACITY TO BRING FORWARD
THE FUTURE ON A ‘WHAT IF’
BASIS

CUSTOMER FOCUS

COMPETITOR KNOWLEDGE
DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE OF OWN BUSINESS

The purpose of such an exercise is to strengthen capacity to quickly apply knowledge. It can
often be the case that students have accumulated knowledge but not in a form that lends itself to
prompt application.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus is upon stimulating capacity for intuitive decision making and the capacity to
accumulate and internalise knowledge in a way that can be transferred into long term memory.

4. Outcomes
Participants will have enhanced capacity to organise knowledge in a manner that enables it to be
applied to different contexts. They will have built confidence in their capacity in this respect.
They will also have greater respect for experiential knowledge.

58

<-----Page 58----->20. Use of Psychometric Tests
1. What is Use of Psychometric Tests?
A psychometric test is a way of assessing a person’s ability or personality in a measured and
structured way. There are 3 main types of tests: ability, personality and interest (although both
personality and interest tests are more like psychometric questionnaires). Tests are frequently
used by employers to help them in their recruitment process and are often used by careers
advisors.
It is also common for graduate employers to use psychometric tests as part of their selection
process. They are used to sift out large number of applicants at an early stage and so save
employers both time and money. A psychometric test can be used in teaching as a basis for
encouraging reflection and learning about the relevance of personal attributes to enterprise
development.
Personality questionnaires are used to determine how people are likely to behave under various
conditions. There are no right or wrong answers, and the questionnaires are usually completed
in your own time. The best way to approach these questionnaires is to answer them as honestly
and straightforwardly as you can. Personality questionnaires can also be used as self-assessment
tools to help you understand your preferences and how these relate to your strengths and
possible areas for development.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The test can be administered online or with paper and pencil. The test can be handed out prior
to a session and scoring can be self administered. The facilitator can use the results in a number
of ways:
 to personalise learning
 to explore the underlying concepts and their validity and relationship to
entrepreneurship development.
 to encourage participants to explore their personal reaction to results with peers and
critique the test and concepts accordingly
 to explore the relevance of the concepts to wider issues of developing an enterprise
culture in society. For example, how do bankers, local government officials, among other
stakeholders, score on entrepreneurship psychometric tests and what are the
implications for the development of the enterprise culture in society
The key concepts can be put before participants and debate encouraged.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Psychometric tests are particularly valuable for use with large groups where it is difficult to
encourage small group discussion. Participants, for example, can discuss the results with the
person sitting next to them. The reflections facilitated by the use of such tests lie at the heart of
personalisation of learning.

59

<-----Page 59----->4. Outcomes
Key outcomes include:




understanding of the limitations of psychometric tests
the personalization of, and reflection upon, key aspects of entrepreneurial attributes
personal reappraisal of the desirability of pursuing an entrepreneurial career

60

<-----Page 60----->Example:
Use of the Durham University, UK - General Enterprising Tendency
(GET) Test
Introduction
The test has been designed to bring together and measure a number of personal ‘tendencies’
commonly associated with the enterprising person. These include: need for achievement; need
for autonomy; creative tendency; risk taking; and drive and determination. The test was
designed as part of the work of the Enterprise in Education and Learning Team within the
Foundation for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. This work has been concerned with
the development of Enterprise in schools, further and higher education institutions. There is
obviously a need to develop measures of enterprise for purposes of assessment and perhaps also
to identify training needs. The General Enterprising Tendency Test embodies the enterprise
tendencies described above, expresses them in statement form and measures enterprise
aptitudes against norms.
The test has been developed following research into a variety of measures used to determine
entrepreneurship and enterprise. It has been validated with a number of different groups of
personnel and amended accordingly. The aim during this research and development process has
been to develop a measure of enterprising tendency rather than of entrepreneurial traits.
The GET Test may be of use in a variety of situations. It might for example be used to measure
the enterprise of personnel involved in providing support to business, social and community
enterprise. It might be used to measure the enterprise of those wishing to set up in business. It
might be used, just as importantly, by employers concerned to foster enterprising individuals
within their own organisations. It may be used in the recruitment and selection of personnel. It
may be used to identify changes that have taken place as a result of training or exposure to
certain structured situations designed to encourage enterprise.
A great deal of research has been undertaken into the process of enterprise development. Much
of this in the past has concentrated on the personality of the entrepreneur in attempting to
identify entrepreneurial traits. It has been argued that these desires, drives and attitudes ensure
that an individual has the willingness to take responsibility, the determination to complete
projects, the creativity which will lead to innovation and a healthy appreciation of risk. This
research, much of which stems from the work of Atkinson and McClelland in the 1960s is
controversial, particularly in respect of whether measures taken are of ‘inherent’ as opposed to
‘learned’ traits. The Durham research, funded by the University Grants Committee, extensively
reviewed the literature and a variety of related tests. Out of this review and out of subsequent
experiment came the GET test.
This explains how the test can be administered and the results usefully collated.

61

<-----Page 61----->Instructions
This exercise:
 It will only take about ten minutes
 There are no right or wrong answers
 It will help you to gain a better understanding of yourself
In the following pages of this booklet, you will find a list of 54 different statements. You are
merely required to agree or disagree with the statements that have been made. For
example, one statement might say:
I prefer swimming to running
or
I often take on too many tasks
On the answer sheet provided, you should:
 circle the A in the box which corresponds to the statement if you agree with the statement,
OR
 circle the D if you disagree with the statement.
If, for any reason, you neither fully agree nor fully disagree with a particular statement, please try
to decide whether you agree with it more or disagree with it more and circle the appropriate
answer.
Please be honest when completing the answer sheet. The more accurate your answers are
increases the precision of the test.
Now turn over the page to begin the test.

<-----Page 71----->21 Use of Locus of Control Tests
1. What is Use of Locus of Control Tests?
The purpose of the test in the context of entrepreneurship education is to help participants to
understand how they see the world and in particular how entrepreneurs see the world. The test
described below is based upon the work of the psychologist Rotter (1966) and his measure of
Locus of Control. This test is designed to measure the degree of autonomy that individuals feel
they have in terms of making things happen. Those with high scores are those said to believe
strongly that they can shape the world the way they wish. Those with low scores can be
characterised as those more likely to believe that the world shapes them. The research strongly
supports the view that entrepreneurs score more highly than the population at large. But
whether this reflects personality or the results of exposure to a particular environmentally
dictated ‘way of life’ is open to debate.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Like most tests of a psychometric nature it can be used as the basis for a class discussion, in this
case about the world of the entrepreneur with the test being handed out and completed before
the group meets. The results can be collated anonymously and used for group discussion.
Individuals can be asked to discuss their result with another participant or merely reflect on their
own result in the light of class discussion. The main focus of any facilitated discussion is upon
why entrepreneurs might see the world in this way and what influences them, Research readings
can be discussed. The main advantage of the use of the test in entrepreneurial learning is that it
is suitable for use with large groups of participants (see the example below).

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Completion of the test itself is not a particularly entrepreneurial process. Its value lies not in the
results or debate on the construct validity of the test but in: the process of engagement of
participants; the degree of personal involvement induced by completion of the test; the almost
certain emotional impact it will have on the individual; and then the capacity it creates for lively
engagement about concept, relevance and implication.

4. Outcomes
Participants will have insight into the way entrepreneurs see the world and will understand why
they see it as so. They will also have understanding of the implications for society in terms of one
aspect of creating Entrepreneurial Mindsets

72

<-----Page 72----->Example
Participants are given the following instruction;
This scale is designed to tell you a little bit more about how certain important occurrences in
society affect different individuals.
The activity will be carried out in three steps:

Step 1
Complete the attached scale according to the instructions preceding it

Step 2
Score your own responses according to the scoring system handed out

Step 3
We will then discuss the results in terms of:
a. Which individual differences are revealed by the results?
b. What do the individual scores tell us about our individual and group’s approach to life?
c. In what way might we wish to change approaches to life?

The Test
Guidance
This is a questionnaire to find out how certain important occurrences in society influence
different people.
Each item in the attached questionnaire consists of two alternatives marked ‘a’ and ‘b’. Please
choose one statement from each pair (and only one); you must be convinced that it is so, as far as
you are concerned. Ensure that you choose the one of which you believe that it is more true,
rather than the one which you think you should choose, or the one which you would rather like
to be true. This is a measure of personal conviction; there are obviously no right or wrong
answers.
Your answers must be filled in on the separate answer sheet.
Please answer the items carefully, but do not spend too much time of any of them. Ensure that
you give an answer to each choice. Write ‘a’ or ‘b’ next to the number of the item on the answer
sheet, depending on the statement which you believe to be most true.
In some cases you may find that you believe both statements, or none of them. In such a case
ensure that you choose the one which you are more convinced about.
React to each item separately when you make a choice; don’t be influenced by your previous
choices.
Please proceed.

<-----Page 77----->22. Use of Relationship Learning
1. What is Use of Relationship Learning?
Relationship Learning is arguably at the crux of the capacity of the entrepreneurial venture to
survive and grow. It is undoubtedly the case that most of the learning of the individual
entrepreneur takes place in the management of relationships with all stakeholders necessary for
the survival of the business. The essence of managing the independent business (and indeed
many other types of business or organisations) can be described as the capacity to manage
interdependency with stakeholders on a day to day basis under conditions of more or less
uncertainty. The reputation and the Intangible Assets of the business are built up largely on this
basis. The process of how this takes place was described in the Pedagogical Note xxxxx).
Relationship Learning is the process by which stakeholders (customers, suppliers, channel
representatives, financial agencies, professional services, family, partners, workforce, local and
national government, regulatory and other agencies, including the media and education bodies),
are engaged in a two way learning process to mutual benefit.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants are divided into groups of four to six. They are asked to divide in turn, into one subgroup representing an entrepreneurial stakeholder as noted above and the other the
entrepreneur facing the development of a relationship – existing or new. For example, it could
be a banker faced with a new entrepreneurial proposition or funding for a new development
from an existing client. It could be a large company buyer facing an entrepreneur seeking to get
on to a buying list. Or it could be just an existing regular customer for a small firm supplying it
with subcontracting services on a regular basis.

Example - Building learning and education relationship
Company X is a small electrical subcontracting firm supplying services to a large locally owned
builder Y on a regular basis

GROUP 1. The Subcontractor owner - manager of X – Educating the Customer
- What does my customer need to know about me - in general and in terms of the specific
transactions we undertake?
- Where might be the gaps and how might I fill them?
- How is s/he currently likely to learn about me and my business?
- How might I improve the process?
- How might I bring forward the future for the customer?

GROUP 2. The Subcontractor owner manager of X – Learning from the Customer
-

What do we need to know about the customer in general and to improve transactions?
Where are likely to be the gaps and how might we fill them?
What are the processes by which we currently learn?
How can we improve them?
How can we learn more about their future?
78

<-----Page 78----->GROUPS 3 AND 4 Can explore the same questions playing the role of the builder Y
All four groups can then get together and explore how they might collectively develop the
learning relationship and what results this might have.
As part of the above process participants may be asked to explore how they might use third
parties in the education and learning processes. For example ‘can I use my banker to educate my
customers as to the solidity and reliability of my business – how?’
Another useful addition would be to ask the groups to explore how the use of IT might enhance
the learning and educating process, for example in:
 building up a profile of an individual customer
 online interaction with the customer
 improving speed of response
 joint problem solving
 sharing market/customer analysis
 sharing new market development using in-house data
 environment scanning - common threats and opportunities

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The aim is to simulate the way in which entrepreneurs learn from relationships – a process
central to the development of entrepreneurial behaviours. It is not necessary for the participants
to have experience of the businesses or of the relationships in the industry. The exercise is to
help them gain insight into the processes likely to be involved, create empathy with
entrepreneurial ways of doing things and understand how trust based relationships might be
built up and transactions costs reduced.

4. Outcomes
Participants will know how to engage with stakeholders. They will also understand that they
need to assess their own knowledge around the degree to which it fosters sound relationship
education and learning.

79

<-----Page 79----->23. Use of Immersion
1. What is Use of Immersion?
It is clearly evident to those who work closely with owner managers of Small Businesses,
particularly at the start up stage that they ‘learn by doing’ rather than by study and analysis of
large amounts of formal information and periods of reflection. In practice this does not mean
that they jump wildly into a business but that they gradually immerse themselves in the
‘community of practice’. It has lately been discovered that this process – one labelled
‘effectuation’ has also been the hallmark of the start up of many large US businesses in the top
Fortune 500 at their start up point. Somewhat controversially the business plan is not a
metaphor for this process although it remains a central focus of much teaching for
entrepreneurship.
How to simulate the ‘immersion’ process in Entrepreneurship programmes remains challenging.
For purposes of this note it is assumed that this immersion process involves elements of risk
reduction, strategic thinking and learning under pressure. This can be simulated in a number of
ways.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The immersion process can be simulated at a number of levels.
Incremental practice of learning
The hallmark of an immersions entrepreneurial programme is the complete commitment to the
practice of every
item of formal learning, reflection and ‘doing it again and again’ until it is right and acceptable in
the ‘real world’ (adding tacit value to explicit knowledge). This has major implications for
programme design and resource. Standard in-house forms of assessment of progress in learning
and then moving on are inadequate. Presentations of business plans are no substitute for
engaging the key stakeholders in practice. A key example would be to eschew formal market
research for a product/service idea in favour of getting into contact directly with as many
customers as possible, presenting and learning and modifying until the idea has been shaped by
the real world response and the presentation honed by repeat practice.
Constant exploration of alternatives to minimise risk
At a start-up stage to massage the proposal constantly to limit exposure to risk by repeated use
of the question – Can this be done in another way?, using less resource and involving less
exposure. An example might be in a proposed manufacturing context to maximise the
subcontracting of the product focusing resource and commitment on the customer and the
market.
Strategic ‘What if’ scenario exercises
The use of strategic ‘what if’ scenario groups. This involves dividing a group of participants with a
business idea into small groups and brainstorming in turn on ‘what if’ scenarios. What if a sales
target is not met? What if a customer asks for something different? What if the major customer
does not pay? What if your bank refuses to maintain its overdraft? What if your supplier goes out
of business? What if you find someone already is doing what you are doing? What if you are ill?
What if your lover leaves you or gets a job somewhere else? How do I know when to get out of a
business? How do I do it? All of these become key strategic questions and core components of
this approach.
80

<-----Page 80----->Anticipating problem exercises
The above approach, in turn, can be built into a process of anticipating problems and working on
how to deal with them and prevent them. Thus knowledge delivered takes a problem solving
format, bringing forward items that may occur in an early immersion experience. Thus ‘risks’ are
anticipated. A dozen or so ‘reasons why firms are driven out of business can be explored and
strategies for anticipation and problem prevention discussed (see Annex)
Entrepreneur mentors
The use of entrepreneur mentors on an ongoing basis is an important way of simulating an
immersion process. They, rather than professionals are likely to ask the ‘street-wise’ questions.
The use of entrepreneurs in this way is best undertaken on a one to one basis if honest and open
appraisal is to be sought. It is arguably also important that they are not ‘trained’ for this process.
Brainstorming Strategic Know-Who
An important component in simulating the immersion process is engagement in strategic knowwho relationship development exercises focused upon the issue of building trust. This can be
prefaced by brainstorming exercises in order to profile ‘what makes a good’ customer, supplier,
accountant, lawyer, banker, consultant etc. This process will result in a series of checklists that
can then be used for ‘real life’ profiling. Such profiling exercises are not just organisational but
also ‘people oriented’. People choices are a core component of immersion strategies and indeed
of problem anticipation. The personal profile criteria that emerges that can then be used for
appraisal of real world stakeholders.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
All of the above exercises are focused upon developing capacity to learn by doing, by problem
solving and by strategic thinking within a simulation of, or real exposure to, the community of
practice.

4. Outcomes
Participants will be better prepared to learn from immersions experienced in the future. When
combined with the outcomes of other guides, for example, those on relationship learning,
networking and intuitive decision making, they will be better equipped to cope with making
sense of exposure to learning under pressure.

81

<-----Page 81----->ANNEX
Brainstorming on anticipating Early Immersion Problems in start-up
Participants are taken through the process of exploring how each of these might arise, how they
can be ‘early warning’ detected and how they might be dealt with. Examples and anecdotes will
need to be prepared.

Recent start ups may get into difficulty because they:
Invest too much in assets
Attempt too much too soon
Have an inadequate equity base
Neglect basic systems
Over-trade
Stick too rigidly to plans
Have the wrong mix of finance
Forget about tax
Make inadequate contractual agreements
Make inadequate bank arrangements
Don’t talk regularly to their banker to explain unforeseen events
Under-price
Confuse profit with cash
Forget about overheads
Don’t listen to customers
Become over-dependent on too few customers
Pick poor customers
Don’t get paid
Have poor receivables management
Neglect family
Overlook working capital need
Forget about salary
Neglect supply quality and supplier base
Organise time badly
Neglect Know -Who
Take too much out of the business
Fall out with partners
Neglect business viability criteria - profit/cash/salary

82

<-----Page 82----->24. Use of Achievement Motivation
(Following the work of McClelland and Winter et al.)

1. What is Use of Achievement Orientation?
The theory of Achievement Motivation attracted much academic debate in the 1970s and ‘80s,
however much of the work, with its focus upon Entrepreneurial Traits, has been dismissed in
more recent times, but the education and training approaches based upon this concept are still
used widely throughout Asia in Entrepreneurship Development Programmes (EDPs) as are many
of the psychological constructs. The concept has also been developed by the McBer Corporation
in the USA as the basis for a range of senior executive development programmes. Key
components of the model are described below in a normative fashion.
The Achievement Motivation Learning concept embraces a wide range of entrepreneurial
behaviours and attitudes of persons. These include:
i. A high orientation towards success and excellence
ii. A desire to improve on earlier achievements. There is constantly a lookout for doing things
better, quicker, more effectively. Fantasies centre around increasing effectiveness and
improving achievements
iii. An interest in finding new ways in which to excel and have success. Without this being really
necessary, there is a constant search for opportunities for achievement
iv. The pursuit of standards of excellence in order to determine personal effectiveness via:
- Benchmark re competition with others
- Use of external norms of performance, e.g. examination grades, profit percentages,
etc
- Development of internal, self-determined, personal norms of excellence and
success
Programmes based upon this concept therefore seek to develop attitudinal characteristics of
people with a high need for achievement including:
 Risk taking
 Personal responsibility
 Feedback
 Initiative in researching the environment.

Risk Taking
The individual with an achievement orientation is fundamentally orientated towards average
risks. Low risk situations are avoided. In these situations it is easy to achieve success but very
little satisfaction is gained from such success. Extremely high risk situations are also avoided. It
may be possible to obtain high satisfaction from these situations the probability of success is too
small to be attractive and it may even be possible to dismiss success as being due to pure luck. A
situation with a medium risk represents sound entrepreneurial behaviour with a high enough
probability of success and enough challenge to let individuals feel that they will have to exert
themselves against the possibility of failure.

83

<-----Page 83----->Personal Responsibility (to see things through)
As per the entrepreneurial Locus of Control construct (see Guide 21), an individual with an
achievement orientation feels that events can be controlled rather than that merely being
shaped by external influences. There is an orientation to start things, cause things to happen and
create change in the environment. There is a search for new, original innovative activities. Hard
work stimulates a desire for feedback. Once a problem is solved there is a loss of interest. There
is a constant search for new successes and new solutions to old problems. There is a capacity for
strategically assessing and planning for events rather than leaving them to chance.
The individual with an achievement orientation wants to carry personal responsibility. He wants
to be able to initiate activities and take decisions in situation where he, in the end, can claim the
results for himself and enjoy the satisfaction of the achievements. He/she has enough selfconfidence to take credit for success as well as blame for failure of activities. He/she does not
necessarily like suggestions from other people as to what to think or what to do and is not a
conformist under social pressure.
These characteristics do not imply that the achievement orientated individuals can only act alone.
It does imply that they are happier in jobs where there is individual freedom and responsibility.
They can work effectively in co-operative situations, as long as they can play a determining role in
at least some of the decision making.

Feedback
Individuals with an achievement orientation want concrete, immediate and direct feedback
about their performance. They want both positive and negative feedback i.e. indications that
their efforts are leading towards success, as well as information about what is leading to failure.
Such feedback is performance related. Money can be seen as a concrete symbol of success
rather than as a motivating factor. It is an indication how well he person is doing and does not
necessarily motivate the individual to work harder.

Researching the Environment
Individuals with achievement orientation show a great deal of initiative in exploring and
researching the environment. This ties in with efforts to find new opportunities for high levels of
achievement. While new situations for achievement are sought they are also utilised. Energetic
activity is a characteristic. The achiever does not work hard in all situations but is selective in
working hard in situations which are challenging and where the possibilities of success and failure
are present. Routine tasks are not sought or enjoyed.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The Concept of Achievement Orientation/Motivation is very broad and embraces a range of
entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes. Equally it involves a wide range of pedagogical
techniques, some of which are described below. The pedagogical activities associated with the
construct, in addition to the above include role play, interview techniques and games. There are
three examples provided in the Annex.

84

<-----Page 84----->3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
All of the components of the Achievement Motivation model can be seen as highly relevant to
pedagogical processes of entrepreneurial learning. Most of the associated exercises serve to
create insight into the key characteristics of the entrepreneur, stimulate imaginative behaviour
and enhance capacity to see the world through entrepreneurial eyes.

4. Outcomes
Participants will have a very clear view of the dominant characteristics associated with
Achievement Orientation and will have internalised key aspects of the related behaviours. They
will also have insight into ways of stimulating them.

85

Example 1
Achievement Motivation Assessment Role Play: Job Interview

Instructions
This exercise aims to follow up on an introduction to Achievement Motivation. Its aim is to
enable the participants to put into practice the learning about the behaviour of an achievement
orientated person. Participants form groups of three. One member of the group will play the
role of an interviewer, another, the interviewee and the other as observer. Separate instructions
are given to each person.
Two rounds may be played – with separate instructions for each. Different individuals will play
different roles during the two rounds.

ROUND ONE
Instructions for the Observer
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee. After the
interview you will report back on the behaviour observed in achievement orientation terms.
Use the four attitudes of the achievement orientated behaviour. You may wish to introduce a
simple scoring system.

Instructions for the Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for a position as Stakeholder Relations Development and
Marketing Manager in your organisation which is a Centre for Enterprise in a university/college.
You are the Centre Director with, at least in your view, a great deal of success behind you. In
your own perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long term. You compete
with your own standards of excellence and not so much with other people. The person you are
looking for should be somebody with a great deal of achievement motivation, harnessed into a
striving to also get the co-operation of subordinates.

Instructions to Interviewees
You are to be interviewed for a position as Stakeholder Relations Development and Marketing
Manager in the Nirvana College Centre for Enterprise.
You are not madly keen on the position and your previous experience has been in finance. In
applying for this position you are really taking a chance as the salary is a great deal higher than
your present income. You are also interested in the perks of academic life and the possibility to
travel extensively around the region and indeed beyond.
Your qualifications are good but all on the accounting and finance field. You are basically looking
for a position where you can make more money and launch yourself off into a more lucrative
career in marketing.

86

<-----Page 86----->ROUND TWO

Instructions for Observers
You have to observe and read the behaviour of the interviewer and interviewee. After the
interview you will report back on the behaviour observed in achievement orientation terms.
Use the four attitudes of the achievement orientated behaviour. You may wish to introduce a
simple scoring system.

Instructions to Interviewer
You are to interview a candidate for a position as Stakeholder Relations Development and
Marketing Manager in your organisation which is a Centre for Enterprise in a university/college.
You are the Centre Director with, at least in your view, a great deal of success behind you. In
your own perception you are highly motivated towards success in the long term. You compete
with your own standards of excellence and not so much with other people.
The person you are looking for should be somebody with a great deal of achievement motivation,
harnessed into a striving to also get the co-operation of subordinates.

Instructions for Interviewees
You are to display as much achievement orientated behaviour as possible during the interview.
You are anxious to get the job because it is a logical step in your career and presents a great
personal challenge.
You are a marketing specialist. The job you are applying for is with an organisation that is
perceived as a regional centre for excellence. The job is described as that of a ‘Stakeholder
Relations and Development Marketing manager’. You are not sure what the job entails although
it is clear that, as far as salary is concerned, the job means a step forward in your career.
Following the role plays the group are asked by the facilitator to reflect on the contextual
relevance of the Achievement characteristics monitored in the interviews observed, how easy it
was to monitor these and whether they can spot these in future situations or indeed act them out.

The end result of this activity will be a fully developed programme for the proposed activities of
the members of a currently rather weak Student Enterprise Association. The aim of the
programme is to maximise the achievement motivation of the future members of this
organisation through the various planned activities in the programme.
You can assume that a medium or average degree of achievement orientation is already present
in the members.

Step One
The participants are divided into groups of 4. Each group develops a programme of activities
stretching over 12 months, 3 evenings per week plus two weekends per month designed to
achieve the aim as set out above. Every activity must be aimed at the development of some
aspect of achievement orientation. Ensure that every aspect of the programme is designed to
appeal to the total group.

Step Two
Participants now meet in groups of 12 (joining up 3 former groups). During these meetings
consensus must be reached on the contents of a year programme for the maximisation of
achievement orientation of the members of the Association.
Each group must be able to motivate the contents of their proposed programme. Optimal use
must obviously be made of the contents of the programme developed by earlier group members.
Each group must appoint a spokesman to present as effectively as possible to proposed
programme to the full class of participants and other teams.
The Facilitator will then use the session to appraise the degree to which it has been possible to
embody the Achievement Motivation characteristics in the Plans and may seek to expand and
brainstorm on further ideas.

Making imaginative use of Achievement Motivation Constructs
Instructions
Part 1
This exercise can be carried out in small groups or on an individual basis. It is a test of
comprehension of the reasons why people act in a certain way. For each of 4 individuals noted
below a characteristic behaviour pattern is mentioned. The aim is to harvest explanations as to
why they behave in that way. For each description the participants are asked to consider:
1. What kind of individual is this
2. What he/she wants to do
3. What the results of his/her behaviour will be
If they can think of more than one reason, give only the one which they regard as the most
probable. Write your answers in the vacant spaces. Use about 3 minutes for each description.
1.

2.

John always tries something new.

Peter’s friends can always rely on him for a loan.

89

<-----Page 89----->3.

4.

Jonathan said: ‘I am almost sure I can do it’.

Margaret always worries about how she did in examinations.

90

<-----Page 90----->Instructions
Part 2
The general instructions are the same as above. The difference is that participants have to write
as much achievement orientation into the stories as possible. The description of the individual
must be saturated with achievement orientation. The story nevertheless has to be integrated
and not nonsensical. About 10 minutes can be spent on each item.
1.

Henry works much harder that most other people.

2.

Louis will usually undertake a difficult task voluntarily.

91

<-----Page 91----->3.

William will not let obstacles stand in his way.

4.

Margaret always worries about how she did in examinations.

At the end of the exercise the facilitator can discuss with the group the influences upon how we
see and interpret events and how an entrepreneurial person might see them.

92

<-----Page 92----->25. Use of Personality Selling Exercises – The Balloon Debate
1. What is Use of Balloon Debate?
The Balloon Debate is a personal selling exercise. Each participant assumes a character. This may
be an entrepreneur, and historical figure, a priest or indeed a person of any kind, famous or
merely generic type (for example a housewife). The person assumed is to have the qualities to
establish a new world embodying new values and ways of doing things. The person can be dead
or alive, fictional or non - fictional and from any walk of life. It is an exercise in imaginative
thinking. All the characters are going up in a hot air balloon to escape from a world falling apart
below. A planet up there is waiting for a new leader. The purpose of the exercise is to enable
each character assumed to argue/sell themselves as the best person to lead this new world.
Progressively the participants are eliminated by a voting process until only one person is left in
the balloon – the future world leader. One example might set the objective as being the leader
of a future entrepreneurial society.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
After a brief introduction, each participant is asked to assume a character.
Round 1.
Each is then given 5 minutes to prepare a one minute speech. The speech aims to sell themselves
as the person with the vision, the leadership qualities and character to build a new world. After
the speeches a vote is taken to select the top 5 (say out of a group of 20). One cannot obviously
vote for oneself.
Round 2.
Each of the remaining participants make a 30 second speech aimed at destroying any arguments
put forward by the others – they are not at this stage promoting themselves.
Round 3.
Each character then makes a 30 second speech defending themselves and making a final
statement as to why they are the future leader of the world and better than the others The last
sentence must be a real rallying cry.
Round 4.
This can be a 1 minute rapid fire hot seat of each candidate by the remaining participants,
There is then a final vote to select the new world leader.
Round 5.
This is a post mortem discussion led by the facilitator as to why the final leader was chosen –
bringing out aspects of personality, persuasive argument and presentation.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is essentially a personal selling exercise. It brings out the importance of the
entrepreneurial personality. The emphasis is upon personal projection and the ability to
articulate convincing argument under pressure. In an entrepreneurial real world situation
customers and stakeholders are ‘buying’ the personality and estimated capacity of the ‘seller’.
Projection of self belief, engagement of the ‘audience’, and personal charisma are dominant. The
argument is often of less importance.

93

<-----Page 93----->4. Outcomes
The key outcome is the realisation that stakeholders in an entrepreneurial world ‘buy’ the person
as much as the product. The two are inseparable.

94

<-----Page 94----->26. Use of Finding Opportunities (Ideas for Business)
1. What is Use of Finding Opportunities (Ideas for business)?
This is a process of focusing participant attention on how ideas emerge in the market place to
solve problems or grasp opportunities. It can be argued that a key aspect of entrepreneurial
behaviour is to see problems as opportunities. The exercise also aims to focus the group on how
all products and services can be seen as combinations of meeting needs and that thinking
through this process can be a key component of the opportunity identification process.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The exercise can be divided into three parts.
The first part aims to demonstrate how all products and services meet combinations of needs and
that exploration of this process can provide a means for finding new opportunities.
The second part explores the process of identifying opportunities from problems
The third part provides participants with a list of simple ways into business and asks them to
explore these.

All Products and Services as combinations of needs.
To demonstrate the point that all products/services are combinations of needs, the participants
are asked to brainstorm on the needs met by different products/services. For example they are
asked to write down as many needs that they perceive a sofa could meet that might be in the
minds of a potential customer (this latter condition rules out the fantasy answers including new
kinds of comfort rockets to the moon etc). A prize can be given for the first person to write down
12 needs.
The facilitator then takes up all the answers on a flip chart and will end up with a list as below:

Needs a sofa can meet
Filling space
Saving space
Storage
Non-inflammable
Durable
Aesthetic
Status
Seating capacity
Convert to bed
Orthopaedic
Easily moved

Feels warm/soft
Easy to match
Can work on it
Can eat on it
Can drink on it
Resists animal fur
Can put feet up
Room divider
Firm or soft
Versatile seating
Bespoke seating

Period
Innovative
Cheap/expensive
Sturdy for kids
Change fabric
Gets through door
Colour coding
Easily cleanable
Washable fabric
Non-fading

Participants are then asked to describe the significance of this. What will emerge with good
facilitation is that different sofas meet different combinations of needs and are therefore aimed
at different sets of customers. Rich newly married/partnered will seek different combinations
from relatively poorer people with young families living in confined spaces etc. Retired older
persons will also have different sets of needs. Participants can be asked as to where they may
see new combinations for new sets of customers.

95

<-----Page 95----->The same exercise can be undertaken with a whole range of other products and services. The
facilitator needs to think about this in advance and prepare for possible responses.
Participants can then be given examples of how new products and services enter the market by
processes of
Meeting Previously Unmet needs?
Needs being better met?
More needs being met?
Different combinations of needs?
All of the above can be brainstormed.

Seeing Problems as Opportunities
To explore this, participants can be grouped and asked to brainstorm/identify recent personal or
other observed experiences where there have been problems or opportunities. For example, on
holidays, at work, at clubs, in the home, in the community, in leisure pursuits etc and identify
opportunities for enterprises that might be set up to solve problems or grasp opportunities.
These can then be presented in a ‘sales pitch’ style.

96

<-----Page 96----->27. Use of Ways into Business
1. What is Use of Ways into Business?
Participants are given lists of ways of getting into business as shown below and given examples to
stimulate brainstorming.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants may then be divided into small groups and given (or select) one or more of the list
below. They may brainstorm on their selection or, as a longer project exercise they can be asked
to go out and investigate the potential and return with ideas. These are then presented in a
persuasive manner to the rest of the group. The best – most convincing - presentation can then
be rewarded.
1. Licensing - visit trade shows-advertise-read trade journals-approach foreign companiescontact agents- approach embassies
2. Franchise - view international franchise magazines-approach foreign banks-find franchise
consultants-read business journals
3. Rebuilding and re manufacturing products - find products that you can rob for others, for
example, bicycle frames to make trailers or making go carts out of lawn mowers
4. Purchasing or assembling for others - find products where assembly is expensive-put out
parts and assemble/look for items that are bulky to transport and can be transported in a
collapsed form and assembled
5. Taking a little bit of a large market - find a growing market such as jeans, stationary and air
conditioning or computer parts
6. Catering for left behind markets - look for good companies changing products rapidly and see
what are leaving behind and look for industries that are going for up-to-date-ness
7. Adding value to existing products - brainstorm on products, for example holidays, tennis
balls, tennis racquets, bespoke clothing
8. Substituting material in existing products - find materials that much change because of
environment protection, for example; flame proof fabrics and furnishing materials, plastic
pipes.
9. Becoming a supplier to a producer - approach existing producers to identify supply problems,
look at tender lists, approach purchasing agent
10. Import replacement - examine import catalogues, go shopping for foreign goods, contact
purchasing agents for stores, look at import stats, and identify expensive imported goods.
11. Inventing a product to meet a need in the market place - examine closely products that you
know, brainstorm on problems and needs
12. Second try situations - find failures and look for reasons. Look for magazines, run adverts and
watch press for failures
13. Imitating successful products - look at what is selling well, look abroad[ Hong Kong] for
successful products and services
14. Transferring concepts from one industry to another - find a problem that has been solved
elsewhere, for example customised credit cards.
15. Marketing someone else's product - look for poorly marketed products, contact embassies
and trade associations, look at venture magazines
16. Taking a patent opportunity - go to a patent office, look for a patent consultant, advertise
17. Import distribution and agent - read trade journals, contact foreign embassies, join
associations
18. Export distribution - contact associations and producers, contact -external chambers and
consulates

97

<-----Page 97----->19. Becoming a distributor or agent for someone else's product - look for companies keen to
expand but without a sales force; look for products that are distributed to a wide variety of
small outlets, join associations. Look at trade journals and newspaper ads
20. Discount selling - look for bankrupt companies, companies with excess stock, manufactures
with 'seconds'. Contact sales agents, liquidators, stockists and distributors
21. Find a unique or niche group and tailor a product to them - identify special groups within a
large batch of purchasers of a product or service and segment[ vacation groups ], upper class
new tastes
22. Taking existing products to a new market - look abroad for things that people buy and might
buy in your own country and not yet available, identify locally made products that have
potential in wider markets
23. Taking advantage of market switches - look for problems with new products and services,
analyse changes in consumer spending and tastes
24. Packaging - look for unpackaged products. Look for poorly packaged products, look for
packaging that is unfriendly to the environment

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is focused substantially on discovery and exploratory learning processes involving
idea generation and evaluation as well as presentation. It builds upon the personal experience of
participants and it also can induce high levels of humour.

4. Outcomes
The central desired outcome – which can be tested – is that participants have an enhanced
capacity to see problems as opportunities and have frames of reference available for appraising
them.

98

<-----Page 98----->28. Use of Leveraging the Student Interest
1. What is Use of Leveraging the Student Interest?
In the University/College context a key challenge is to create wide awareness across all disciplinary
areas of the relevance of entrepreneurial learning and programmes. Leveraging the student
interest to create staff interest is a major component of a ‘whole university’ strategy. Not all
students will have an interest in starting a business or indeed a capacity so to do. All, however,
will have some interest in their personal development and in their capacity to make an impact in
the job market. The exercise below aims to focus participant attention on the relevance of
‘established’ entrepreneurial attributes and behaviours to their future ‘life-world’. It also can be
used to encourage them to reflect on the university/college contribution to this future

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The exercise consists of the use of two Likert scale questionnaires (see Annex). They can be used
as an ‘in-class’ instrument or sent out electronically to a wider student body. Both questionnaires
are easily completed in a class. Each will take only a few minutes. Questionnaire 1 asks the
students to score the perceived relevance of a number of entrepreneurial attributes and
behaviours to their future work, social and family experience. Questionnaire 2 asks them to use
the same scale to indicate how the university/college experience has served to enhance these
attributes and behaviours. An important distinction, to be explained carefully, is the difference
between what has been enhanced by the formal university disciplinary learning process as
opposed to the wider experience of university life.
The questionnaires are administered in sequence and the second one is introduced after some
discussion of meanings from the first answers.
If the instruments are used as a ‘class’ exercise then they should be prefaced by a class
discussion/brainstorming on the attributes and behaviours associated with being
‘entrepreneurial’. The major headings in the questionnaire can be drawn out by this process.
There can also be some discussion as to who they are relevant to – in what career contexts although this is best left until after the completion of the first questionnaire. After the
questionnaire is completed the participants are asked to draw a connecting line linking up their
‘scores’ so that here is a visible profile. The facilitator can then go through the questions asking
for scores and facilitating discussion of why they were scored in this way. It is obviously
impossible to collate scores in a live situation. But it is possible for the facilitator to ask who
scored a six or seven and then pick up on reasons why, similarly with scores below the median
level.
Discussion on each attribute and its contexts can then be facilitated.
After adequate discussion the second questionnaire can be handed out and a similar discussion
facilitated as to the reasons why the university experience scores high or low. Comparisons can
be made with the impression of their personal scores. This is perhaps best done through small
group discussion. Small group discussion can also be used to bring out explanations for
variances. Full group debate can be focused upon different contexts for entrepreneurial
behaviour – Who needs to be entrepreneurial? (Doctors, police, religious leaders, local
government, bankers etc). If desired this can lead further discussion of the changing
environment and complexity and uncertainty and how everyone is being affected in some way.
This might be the focus for further sessions.
99

<-----Page 99----->The questionnaires are completed anonymously and can be collected in, analysed and used
carefully for discussion with university/college staff.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is designed to bring out the relevance of entrepreneurial behaviours and attributes
to wider contexts. It also deliberately builds from the perspective of the participants, giving them
ownership of the discussion and allowing them to benchmark their own views and experiences
with others in a non- threatening environment.

4. Outcomes
The major participant outcome is that they will gain a perspective on the wider relevance of the
entrepreneurial paradigm and will be better able to take a personal perspective on this. The data
can also be used by the facilitator to leverage interest in the university/college in the broader
cross university relevance of entrepreneurial learning.

<-----Page 102----->29. Use of Start up Frames, Stages of Start-up. Tasks and Learning Needs
1. What is Use of Start up Frames and Stages of Start-up?
A new venture proposition can be appraised under 6 key headings:
THE
IDEA

THE
ABILITY
SUCCESS?

MOTIVATION
COMMITMENT

RESOURCE

PLAN

ORGANISATION
ADMINISTRATION

The Framework is shown in detail below in Exhibit 1. It has been used extensively in the
counselling of start-ups by the UK Small Firms Service. The process of setting up a new venture
can also be described in terms of a number of stages below.
Acquiring Motivation

Finding an Idea
Validating the Idea

Finding the stimulus and commitment to pursue the objective of
setting up a business or new organisation (for the individual, related
group, community and family)
Finding an idea upon which it seems reasonable to spend time
evaluating further. Or an alternative means of getting into business
(franchise license, buying a business, etc.)
Making it or doing it. Testing the product/service (technically and
with the customer). Protecting it. Testing the market.

Identifying the Resources

Negotiating to get into Business
Birth and Survival

Planning the necessary or desirable scale of business entry.
Identifying: the detailed resources required; the timing; the quality
of suppliers, materials; identifying sources of assistance
Applying the plan. Negotiating for finance, premises, contracts, subcontractors, etc. Selecting the type of company and registering it.
Developing the necessary ongoing systems to keep a business in
operation. Coping with all the statutory requirements. Building
relationships with professionals who can help. Establishing clear ties
with customers and suppliers (and the workforce).

103

<-----Page 103----->While it is clear that many people set up new ventures without formally going through these
stages, if this is not done then it can create many difficulties that often lead to failure. Examples
include those who formally set up the new venture but have not:








Really clarified the idea (they set up a sandwich bar without clear consideration of the
full range of food to be offered: they start a pottery without clear focus on the range of
ceramics to be produced)
Really validated the idea (in terms of close discussion with potential customers,
examination of the full range of competition, ability to consistently make to standard
etc.)
Really explored the implications of the scale of business needed to make a good living or
produce a reasonable profit or return on the investment (for example, a person going
into the commemorative glass engraving business fails to estimate adequately the total
amount of time to be taken and the associated costing and pricing needed to make a
living)
Negotiated adequate resources, for example, borrowing too little from the bank in the
first instance so that recourse has to be made for further funds after only a few months
of trading
Set up adequate systems and contract arrangements (leading to inadequate control of
cash or problems with contractual suppliers or customers)
Anticipated problems that might occur in early trading (for example failure of customers
to pay on time, delays in supplies, bottlenecks in operations, management of personal
time)

2. How is the exercise constructed?
There are a number of ways of using the stages approach in the design and delivery of new
venture programmes.
1. Course participants are asked first to brainstorm for 10 minutes on the question; ‘If you were
asked to interview the session leader on his/her business idea what questions would you ask
to determine if they were likely to be successful in their new venture. The facilitator then
takes the answers for each group in turn and places them into the boxes as in Exhibit 1 below
– filling it out via a process of discussion with the participants.
2. Participants can then use the framework which is handed out to appraise each other’s
business concept – identifying strengths and weaknesses and needs for action.
3. Participants are then introduced to the stages concept as per the above. They are given a full
list of the tasks as set below (Exhibit 2).
4. Participants can then be divided into small groups or conduct one to one interviews to
determine at which stage their respective ideas have reached and what they need to do next.
5. The checklists can be used to determine learning needs with a group (see the Exhibit 3 below)
and therefore used to determine inputs to the programme.
6. The material can be used in conjunction with a case (see Pedagogical Note 34) where
participants are given the task of appraising a business plan for Strengths and Weaknesses and
also to indicate at what stage the proposer has actually reached
7. The New Venture Programme can be run as a series of modules – following each module
participants can be asked to undertake a number of tasks as set out for that stage.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach follows the heuristics of start up appraisal, implanting initially, via the framework, a
checklist in the new venture’s mind against which he/she can appraise their own start up
proposition – as a guide to action. The Stages approach allows the starter to consider what needs
to be done and what needs to be learned in relation to where they are now. It thus follows the
entrepreneurial learning principle of linking learning closely to doing.

4. Outcome
The intended outcome is that the starter anticipates as many problems and opportunities as
possible during the process of creating the venture thus limiting considerably the risks and stress
involved.

<-----Page 108----->30. Use of the Business Plan as a Relationship Management Instrument
1. What is Use of the Business Plan as a Relationship Management Instrument?
The business plan is often placed as the core of a new venture programme. Yet the research
evidence demonstrates that it has not been central to the initiation of many businesses, even
those that are now global. It is also unlikely that it was ever invented by an entrepreneur. It is
more likely to be the product of those who offer resources to the entrepreneur and need formal
documents and plans to justify their decisions (bankers, venture capitalists, public grant and loan
giving bodies and large company customers and suppliers). This does not mean that the plan can
be a useful means for the entrepreneur to think out his venture. The work of Saraswathy and
others indicates, nevertheless, that the plan rarely turns out is the reality and it is the capacity of
the entrepreneur to learn on his/her feet that is the mark of success in the early and probably
later years.
These thoughts have major implications for the teaching of start-up business planning. Arguably
it is best taught as a relationship management instrument. Although they will all have some
things in common the banker will look for somewhat different things from the formal venture
capitalist, from the angel, from the public agent from the would – be partner and from the
corporate business. The plan, in this case, can be compared with a CV which while containing a
common thread is ‘dressed’ to suit the specific job application. This scenario provides numerous
opportunities for the educator.

Main components of the Business Plan
Different organisations have their own formats but common points are as follows:

The Plan format

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

summary
overall objective – vision
background to development
the needs to be met and customers
the market and potential – reaching it
the people - ability, motivation and commitment
the scale and resource requirement (equipment, staff, materials, location, technology) –
standards – costs
management, organisation and systems
financial plan – available, needs, gap – what if?

The Summary

•
•
•

the name
objectives of new company or development
idea/product, customers, market, competition, USP

available from the various stakeholders where they are available.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
There are a number of different possible approaches.

Role play
The students are given a start–up case (see Pedagogical Note 33). They are then divided into
small groups as follows:
- a bank presentation group
- a venture capital group
- a public grant giving group
- an active partner investor group
- a family group
Each of the groups is divided into two – one subgroup which will present the case to the
stakeholder acting the role of the entrepreneur and the other group representing the
stakeholder. Each subgroup is asked first to brainstorm on what the stakeholder will be most
looking for in the proposal – the entrepreneur group in order to direct the presentation and the
stakeholder group in order to question it. On the basis of their thoughts which are guided by the
facilitator they enter into a negotiating role play for the rest of the class.

111

<-----Page 111----->Class Brainstorming on Case
If time does not permit, the class can brainstorm as a whole on the different stakeholder
perspectives. They can then be given the case and asked to comment upon it from different
perspectives, as a written exercise or full class discussion.

Class Brainstorming on a short mini case statement as below:
2 women who run the successful kiosk chain of ‘underwear fashion’ shops in London. They want
expand their business into jewellery and cosmetics. They need to raise £50,000 for this exercise.
They think that they can get it either from: a bank; their parents; potential partners; Korean
suppliers; venture capitalists; or from government grants.
What would these different stakeholders look for in a Business Plan? What should they
themselves be particularly thinking about to convince themselves?’

Using Stakeholder representatives
As preparation for the exercise the whole group can interview invited stakeholders with the
purpose of identifying what particularly they are looking for in a business plan. The results can
then be compared.
A Guide to the different perspectives that might be found is as follows:

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach is one of learning by and through relationship management. As indicated in earlier
Notes, it is through relationships with stakeholders that entrepreneurs do most of their learning.
The relationship approach to business planning moves participants into this frame of mind.

4. Outcomes
Participants will know how to develop and appraise a business plan from different stakeholder
perspectives and will have practiced negotiation on the basis of the plan.

114

<-----Page 114----->31. Use of Surviving in the Early Years of the Venture
1. What is Use of Surviving in the Early Years?
It has been commented upon extensively in earlier notes that much of entrepreneurial learning
takes place during the first few years of the venture. This is often via a process of solving
problems and responding to the unanticipated demands placed on the venture by the task
environment. It can be argued that the capacity of the venture to survive and even develop will
be the function of the capacity to learn from the experience but also to anticipate problems. The
Annex to the Pedagogical Note 23 on Immersion listed a range of such problems that are known
to occur in the early years of the venture. The challenge to the educator is to organise
knowledge around these issues so that they can be either ‘solved’ before they occur or
adequately prepared for. This demands a problem solving action learning approach where the
knowledge is organised around the problem solution.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Participants are asked to brainstorm on the kinds of problems that might occur in early years of
the venture. The facilitator takes the feedback and can organise it under various headings as in
Exhibit 1 below.

Exhibit 1

FROM INADEQUATE PRE-BUSINESS
PREPARATION
UNFORSEEABLE

SYSTEMS PROBLEMS

PROBLEMS

ARISING FROM THE

STRATEGIC ISSUES
THINKING FOR SURVIVAL RESULTING FROM
BASIC INADEQUACY OF
STRESS AND TIME PRESSURE

BUSINESS SYSTEMS
‘Foreseeable’ Problems
These largely reflect the failure of the start-up business to think through sufficiently each of the
stages of the start-up process. Common problems that will emerge are shown below.

Idea
-

the idea (product or service) does not meet customers’ needs
customer feedback shows a different set of needs or different combination of needs
there are insufficient customers to make a living
the product is indistinguishable from that of established competitors
inconsistency in quality and service (delivery)
the product cuts across existing patents, designs or copyrights
reaching the market proves difficult

115

<-----Page 115----->Resources
Resources have been under-estimated in particular:
- adequate stocking levels have not been catered for
- supplier reliability has not been sounded out carefully enough
- working capital requirements and terms of payment have not been calculated carefully
enough
- work in progress is excessive
- there is excessive wastage
- quality production and distribution has not been maintained at an even level
- outputs have been over estimated because of failure to plan for realistic levels of utilisation

Finance
Financial resources are inadequate as a result of:
- inadequate projection of cash flow particularly negative cash flows
- resultant failure to negotiate sufficient overdraft facility
- taking too much out of the business too early
- failure to control debtor/creditor relationships
- under pricing from the beginning
- insufficient equity
- failure to understand how quickly things happen once a business is started

Management
Professional/management problems including:
- problems with partners covering a wide range of issues such as: disparity of effort; different
attitudes to growth; job demarcation; decision making; rewards from the business; personal
guarantees; management style
- family problems relating to support of the spouse and adequate devotion of time to domestic
life
- weaknesses in personal or technical managerial skills critical to success (for example personal
presentation, negotiation skills)
- basic inadequacy of systems or appropriate management control

Unforeseen Problems
These problems will involve the development of survival strategies and could involve major
unforeseen problems as below:
-

downturns in the economy
changes in key personnel in the external environment (bank managers, buyers, suppliers)
failure of key customers or suppliers
changes in the regulatory environment
fundamental shifts in customer needs
illness, ill health or changes in family circumstances

116

<-----Page 116----->Systems Consolidation problems
These broadly relate to the development of basic systems for survival. The role of the counsellor
will therefore be in analysing basic systems/problems, creating awareness of appropriate systems
and, importantly, demonstrating how these will work. Key problem areas to look for are shown
below.
 cash flow management
 planning cash flows
 basic production/service management systems allowing adequate control of utilisation,
efficiency,
 wastage and quality standards
 development of appropriate trading, profit and loss forecasts and budget systems
 making adequate provision for tax
 ensuring basic office systems
 basic sales analysis and customer feedback systems
 selecting (and using adequately) professional advisers

Strategic Thinking for Survival
Formal business planning is not within the capability of many small businesses. Educators who
place too great an emphasis upon this may be in danger of overloading a management that has
little time to spare. Planning ahead does not, however, have to be highly formalised. It is, above
all, an attitude of mind. The educator can make a major contribution to the small firm in this
respect by focusing participant attention on the longer-term impact of the problems or
opportunities that are being discussed. Strategic issues that are likely to be important to the
survival of the business are listed below:











over dependence on single customers and suppliers
strategic gearing of the business and ability to service external debt
thinking about new ideas and new personnel
ways of coping with inexperience
finding new resources
methods of monitoring the environment ‘appropriate’ to limited resources for example:
reading the
right journals; visiting exhibitions; harvesting information from suppliers and customers;
personal
networking at local, regional and national levels
being unafraid to talk the business through with advisers, the bank manager and other key
persons (even customers) upon whom the business depends for survival
overall, developing recognition that it is not what the owner feels about the business that is
important to survival but what customers, suppliers, advisers and workers feel

The above issues form the basis for programme development. It will be important for the
educator, in addressing any of the four problem areas in Exhibit 1 to focus programme content
not only on solving the immediate problems but also exploring the nature of the other issues
identified above and the management’s strategic thinking about the business. A sound
programme will help to: shape strategic thinking, consolidate the basic systems upon which the
organisation depends (in an appropriate fashion); and facilitate the re-casting of the business
plan to cope with problems that might have been foreseen or indeed are random and largely
unforeseeable.

117

<-----Page 117----->The importance of this approach to the educator is that it provides the focus for the organisation
of knowledge. For example, cash flow management can be approached by analysis of the
reasons what it presents problems resulting from:
 excess working capital accumulation
 inadequate debtor creditor management
 overtrading
 negligence in invoicing
 inadequate bank arrangements
 poor margins
 excessive personal withdrawals
 inadequate volumes
 undercapitalization
 over-gearing

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The approach is essentially focused upon entrepreneurial problem solving.

4. Outcomes
Participants are equipped to anticipate problems that might occur in the early years of the
venture.

<-----Page 118----->32. Use of Segmenting the New Venture Programme Market
1.

What is Use of Segmenting the New Venture Programme Market
As in all education and training programmes there may be different groups of people with very
different learning needs. This is also the case with new Venture Programmes. There may be
distinctive benefits from segmentation as below. Each offer different opportunities in different
localities and often with different sources of programme sponsorship and partnership.

2.

How is the exercise constructed?
In groups, the following list provides stimuli for discussion. Groups can be asked to brainstorm
business ideas to reach each market, or can explore 1 idea, against these potential markets,
looking for market development and new product extensions.

<-----Page 120----->33. Use of Developing Operations Standards as a basis for Estimating Costs and
Controlling Operations
1. What is Use of Operations Standards?
These are standards that might be set formally, or informally estimated, as a basis for controlling
operations in all kinds of service or manufacturing operations. There are four key areas that are
relevant to all kinds of activity.
Utilisation of space, machinery, other assets and labour
Efficiency with which these physical or human assets are used
Wastage of materials consumed in any process or service, and
Quality control of the service or product
The importance of these four areas to setting of costs in a new venture is best demonstrated by a
simple example.
In a motor vehicle repair garage the price of the service to the customer will be a function of:
- the cost of labour in the service
- the cost of the parts/materials used in the service
- recovery of appropriate portion of overheads
Labour charges will need to be based upon estimates of:
Utilisation – the total hours that will be available to be charged out to customers. This is unlikely
to be all the hours that will be paid for by the firm. For example if there are 4 mechanics each
working 40 hours then there are a total of 160 hours ostensibly available. But there will be range
of foreseeable and unforeseen circumstances that will prevent this. Foreseen circumstances will
include toilet breaks refreshment breaks, time spent in cleaning up, time in collecting materials,
time in discussion of problems and in briefing for different jobs etc. There will also be
unforeseeable time lost, waiting for the use of a hoist, discussions with a customer on the
telephone if problems are found during the service, waiting for a particular part etc. In general
therefore the garage can only probably expect to sell out 80 per cent of total time paid for. The
utilisation standard hourly cost will therefore be:
Total wage bill of the 4 mechanics
80% of 160 hours = 128 chargeable hours
Efficiency – the degree to which jobs are undertaken in the time allocated as a standard. Most
major garages will have standards for all the kinds of jobs likely to be undertaken in terms of
labour hours to be spent (for
example standard hours for certain make of car/mileage service, replacing a clutch etc). These
form the basis for estimating costs to the customer. In the major dealerships there will be
manuals that indicate the estimated times for all types of jobs. When a mechanic is allocated a
job he will also be allocated a standard time. When he completes the job he will put the actual
time taken with explanations for any variances. Labour efficiency can therefore be measured at
the end of a week by calculating:
Total time allocated to jobs
Total time actually taken

121

<-----Page 121----->It is unlikely that efficiency will be 100% - many unforeseen problems might occur – so on the
basis of experience a standard may be say 95%. Yet the customer may not always be charged for
the extra hours so there will need to be some allowance made for cost recovery relating to
efficiency standard outcomes. If 5% of hours are lost then a further 8 hours (5% of 160) will need
to taken away from the chargeable hours base above.
Wastage – there will always be wastage of materials and components. Some components may
be damaged in use and therefore written off, some may disappear as mechanics use them for
their own private purposes, some will be faulty etc. Therefore, in reality, it is unlikely that a
garage will ‘sell out’ 100% of all components booked out from the parts department. On the
basis of experience therefore, a standard might be set based upon a calculation of:
Cost of materials booked out to customers
Cost of materials booked out from the parts department
The ‘profits’ made by the parts department will be affected by this and pricing of parts will need
to take into account the ‘wastage' standard.
Quality – quality can be measured in a number of ways – see below. In the context of the garage
it will probably be measured by customer feedback and more importantly by the amount of
‘rework’ the garage has to do in response to customer dissatisfaction.
From a costing
perspective, therefore, a certain standard may need to be set for hours spent on rework
(including extra hours not charged to good customers as gestures of goodwill – for example
replacing or changing around tyres). The number of ‘rework’ hours (let us say estimated a 3 per
week) will therefore need to be deducted from the sold out hours calculation as above.
So in the light of standards set for utilisation, efficiency and quality the hourly cost rater may be
calculated as:
Total labour costs of mechanics
160 – (32 + 8 + 3) =117 sellable hours
In many small businesses, using absorption costing, the total labour hourly charge actually
booked to the customer would be the result of the above plus an addition for overhead and
profit absorptions calculated as follows:
Total overhead costs plus profit estimate
117 hours
This simple example can be expanded as a framework for all kinds of service and manufacturing
activities, no matter what the scale. Its purpose is, however, to critically demonstrate the
importance in any start up situation of properly working out costs and estimating standards as a
basis for this. Also there will be need to develop appropriate, often simple, systems, to measure
performance against standards. In the case of the garage all of this can be designed into a simple
job card.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
1. The importance of the concept can be demonstrated by request to different groups of
participants to work out how utilisation, efficiency, wastage and quality might be measured in
different operating contexts building from the basic framework in Exhibit 1 below.

122

<-----Page 122----->Participants might explore how they would measure and use Utilisation etc in:
Utilisation
Hotels
Restaurants
Computer services
Supermarkets
Furniture manufacture
A pottery
Consulting firm
Cleaning Services
Plastics Extrusion

Efficiency

Wastage

Quality

and how they might use it for costing and produce systems for collecting data for management
control purposes. A major challenge in this is to discuss the relative importance in different
situations of whether to measure physical asset use and efficiency etc or human resource use.
For example, in a hotel, utilisation would be measured by bed nights sold over bed nights
available. Efficiency measures might be different as per different parts of the business (for
example, rooms cleaned per staff hour over a standard). Wastage might be measured in terms of
room materials consumed over room materials available (with an estimate for theft built in).
Quality might be measured by customer complaints or compliments.

<-----Page 124----->1. Entrepreneurs from different types of ventures can be brought in and questioned as to how they
build up costs and develop standards.
2. Participants can be asked to brainstorm and/or investigate what might be the sources of
problems of deviation from standards of utilisation, efficiency, wastage and quality in different
contexts and how these might be measured/controlled by management

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning

The approach boils costing and standards setting down to its simplest form to allow participants
and would-be entrepreneurs to see the ‘wood from the trees’ of operations management, It
focuses upon the core elements of operations management and not sophisticated techniques.

4. Outcomes
Participants will be equipped with the basic capacity to cost and develop and maintain standards
in operations.

125

<-----Page 125----->34. Use of Case Studies
1. What is Use of Case Studies?
The case is a simulation of a ‘real world’ situation more often than not based on research and
usually disguised in name to protect confidentiality. As indicated in Pedagogical Note 14 on
Critical Incidents, there are various levels of case intensity from the short ‘incident’ presented as
a basis of class discussion to the long complex problem solving exercise of many pages.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The case method can be used as a major focus for participative learning often involving pre-class
reading and a list of questions to be considered which will be focused upon in class. Case analysis
may be used for examination and assignment purposes. Case writing may also be part of a
learning programme and can be used, for example, as a final project assignment. The focus of
most case studies is upon problem solving but they can be used as demonstrators as to how
things can be done, as a basis for discussion as to how things should be done, for the
development of frames of reference for analysis and as a basis for demonstrating the value of
certain concepts in practice.
A case study for entrepreneurial learning would have the following components:
1. A case – description of a particular real life situation presenting the basis as noted above for
class based discussion and potentially role play and other pedagogical methods
2. A series of questions/issues for the class to consider
Some issues may be directly related to the case
e.g. ‘Did the managing director ignore key aspects of the environment in making his/her
decision?’ Others may be of a broader conceptual nature
e.g. ‘What are the key components of Strategic Awareness that might be used to explore the
managing Directors approach to the problem?’
Others may be of an action nature
e.g. ‘What should the Managing Director do now and why?’
Others may explore the students’ frame of reference for analysis
e.g. ‘What factors would you take into consideration if you were invited in to the company as a
consultant to assist?’
3. Handouts and articles – which provide a basis for conceptual thinking and sometimes
providing further background information
4. Teacher/facilitator notes – which may or may not be ultimately used as a class handout
The facilitator will need ample whiteboard and flip chart space. He/she will need to be prepared
to organise knowledge emanating from the class in a planned way but will need to be flexible as
the way in which knowledge will emerge cannot always be predicted. Control of the class is
exercised by a mixture of closed and open questions and by use of building and summarising
behaviour.
There will be opportunities for use of a number of pedagogical tools including role play, drama,
presentation skills development, and debate.

126

<-----Page 126----->3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Case teaching can be the antithesis of entrepreneurial learning unless it is used not as an
analytical paper based and essentially reductionist problem solving exercise but as a means for
stimulating wider thinking and conceptualisation of issues. Cases are no real substitute for active
external engagement with real ambiguous situations.

4. Outcomes
Taught entrepreneurially, cases can provide a strong means for the development of frames of
reference and for the practice of certain entrepreneurial skills.

127

<-----Page 127----->35. Use of Exercises in Finding Ideas for Business
1. What is Use of Exercises in Finding Business Ideas?
The aim is to present participants with exercises focused upon identifying ways into business.
They are presented with a select range of opportunities for finding ideas. Some of these were
discussed in Pedagogical Note 28 on Opportunity Identification.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
A range of up to 32 ‘Ways into Business’ can be introduced (see Annex below). Each of these can
be discussed with participants. They can be asked to add to the list of examples and then to
discuss ways of approaching the opportunity based upon the general content outlined in the
Annex and their own experience.
Students may then be broken into groups and given a selection of ‘ideas’, asked to select one or
more and then given a project to identify, evaluate and present the findings to the class as below.
Group 1

a) import replacement possibilities!
b) substitute materials components in an existing product or service where are
problems

Group 2

a) add value to an existing product/service
b) use under-utilised people

Group 3

a) meeting an unmet need
b) meeting a market shortage

Other groups can be given further assignments from the list in the Annex.
Students report back and present the results of their assignment to the whole class. There may
then a vote on the most convincing presentation of an opportunity and how they researched it.
There can also be an accompanying discussion of how the particular opportunity was chosen.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The exercise is essentially one of brainstorming on the basis of existing knowledge, action
learning with the use of frameworks and analysis and presentation.

4. Outcomes
That participants know clearly a large numbers of entry points into business and have explored
many of these. That they are also motivated to follow up on this.

128

<-----Page 128----->ANNEX
GATEWAYS INTO BUSINESS

138

<-----Page 138----->10. ADDING VALUE TO EXISTING PRODUCTS
Defined as?
Taking an existing product or service and adding materials or services to create a more valuable
end product. To add value, you purchase the product or service and use it as a base for
additional operations you want to do before reselling it in a changed form.
The value can be added in several ways:
(a) Putting the product through an additional process
(b) Combining the product with other products
(c) Offering the product as part of a larger package of services
(d) Removing something to change the original use of the product

Where could we find under-used people with skills that we can work with to develop a business
opportunity? What kinds of business opportunities could we explore with people whose talents
are currently not being used?

142

<-----Page 142----->12. COMBINING TWO OR MORE ASSETS INTO A NEW ONE
Defined as?
Combining two different products or services to create a new offering. Ideally, the interaction of
the original items creates something which is unique and more marketable than the separate
items. These items can be products, services, people, businesses or assets.

2. Find the product which is associated with
a market switch by:
(a) Analysing the advantages of new
products to find those which are
greatly superior and will likely replace
more traditional items.
(b) Looking for new technologies or new
products based on concepts which
are revolutionary for an industry.
3. If a major product or service has not yet
been provided for changing consumer
needs, fill the demand.
4. If the major product exists in the switch,
decide on a related service or product
that can be used in association with the
major product.

Key Question for Brainstorming:
Where are there market switches happening in the consumer market and how can we take
advantage of them?

144

<-----Page 144----->14. PACKAGING
Defined as?
Taking an existing product and developing a better way of packaging it for sale. The improved
package might be more attractive, more convenient to use, preserve the product better, be
reusable, and be degradable or other factors. Opportunities may also exist in taking free
materials and packaging them as novelty items. Another aspect is breaking bulk, where supplies
are bought in large quantities, sorted into smaller amounts and re-packaged for sale.

What Are Some Examples?

Key Question for Brainstorming:
How could we package or re-package a product so that it would sell better?

145

<-----Page 145----->15. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A FASHION OPPORTUNITY
Defined as?
Providing a product or service that caters to an up-to-date or prevailing style in dress or
behaviour. The fashion may be something which already exists, is ready to be recycled from
previous times, or does not exist as yet.
A related opportunity concerns fads, which are similar to fashions, but are more intense and of
shorter duration. Because of their rapid rise and fall in popularity, fads require much quicker
response in providing goods and reducing inventories.

<-----Page 163----->36. Use of Exploring the Enterprise Culture in a Globalisation Context
1. What is Use of ‘Exploring the Enterprise Culture in a Global context’?
The aim in this exercise is to explore the relevance of the entrepreneurial concept to society in
general. It has been argued elsewhere1 that entrepreneurial behaviour/competency is required
to cope with, enjoy and indeed create uncertainty and complexity. Such situations occur in
widely different contexts – work, leisure, and family and community life. They are not therefore
solely related to setting up and growing a new venture. The purpose of the exercise is therefore
to focus students upon the nature of uncertainties and complexities that have occurred, are
currently occurring or are anticipated to occur in future in the lives of a range of people in the
community and linked with this, the kinds of entrepreneurial behaviours they are stimulated to
use in response. Background readings on the impact of globalisation can accompany this.2 The
exercise is most suitable as part of the introduction to any entrepreneurship programme as it is
concerned with enabling participants to understand why the entrepreneurial concept is currently
highly visible around the world, how it links with globalisation, why it is so prominent in policy
debates and why the concept itself is being broadened away from entrepreneurship being
focused upon business start up towards the development of the ‘Entrepreneurial Mindset’ in the
population in general.
The exercise also needs to be prefaced by some discussion of Entrepreneurial behaviours, skills
and attributes and how they are stimulated or suppressed by different environments

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The exercise is in a number of parts as follows:
An Introduction which sets out the aims of the whole exercise; the importance of linking
entrepreneurship to the ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity, the fact that such
uncertainties and complexities occur in widely different contexts, the interview process and the
relevance and purpose of use of drama (Annex 1).
Then:
Part 1 Is a participative lecture and discussion on the links of the entrepreneurship concept to
globalisation – see Annex 2 PowerPoint.
Part 2 Is an exploration in class of how this is likely to affect a range of citizens. This can be done
via a brainstorming process using the experiences of friends and relations of class members.
Participants are also given an example of a teacher. Other examples can be brainstormed,
handed out and discussed (Annex 3).
Part 3 The class are briefed to conduct a short 1 – 1.5 hour interview with an individual – not a
business entrepreneur although it could be a manager in a company. They are shown a list for
examples (Annex 3). They are asked to write up the interview in two/three sides as follows:
- short background note on the interview – personal details and occupation
- identification of uncertainties and complexities in their domestic, community, and work life –
past, present and anticipated (as per the examples in Annex 3)
- identification of any associated entrepreneurial behaviours used or attitudes developed

<-----Page 164----->- they are asked to carefully observe the body language and mannerisms of the interviewee to
assist in examination of the degree of emotions behind some of the answers
Part 4 The write-ups of the interviews are assessed and when the group meets again they are
divided into small groups of up to 5 persons. In turn they are asked to role play their interviewee
briefly in response to questions from the others in the group. After this they are invited to agree
on a number of key uncertainties and complexities that seem to be either shared or most
important. They may have up to 5 items. They then write these on a flip chart. Their briefing
note is in Annex 4.
Part 5 They are then introduced to a number of dramatic techniques (Annex 5) and also, if time
permits, subjected to some ‘warm-up’ exercises.
Part 6. They are then asked to construct a drama, using a metaphor if possible to demonstrate
the message. They are assisted in this process by a drama facilitator – writing a story board,
creating a metaphor, developing script, allocating parts and rehearsing. The drama should last
ten minutes. It will have minimum props and costumes but can use imaginatively anything that is
available in the room. Music is permitted. The main purpose of the drama is to project the
messages on the flip chart. But it must also be entertaining and creative (see Annex 6 – Briefing
to Students).
Part 7. They then perform the drama to the rest of the class. After each performance the
facilitator asks the class what were the main messages to come across. These are then compared
with those written on the flip chart by the performing group. The class are asked then asked to
‘score’ the drama awarding marks for the degree to which the message was got across, the
degree of entertainment, and the degree of creativity (see Annex 7).
Part 8. At the end of the drama session there is a review of what the participants have learned
about the various contexts of entrepreneurship in their society and also of what they feel they
have gained from the drama exercise (Annex 8).
Part 9. This is their score and written feedback from the drama facilitator (see Annex 9 for
example).

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
There are two major contributions. The first is to place the entrepreneurial learning process in a
wider context and underpin this in student approaches so that they see the wider relevance of
entrepreneurship to their own future life-world. The second relates to the use of drama.
The conventional academic approach to the stakeholder interview exercises would be to mark
the written report and that would be that. Asking members of the class to pool results write and
perform in this way serves a number of purposes:
 It is a reminder that no information received from interviews and research approaches (no
matter how good the checklist) is truly objective. The results always reflect the values and beliefs
of the person interviewed and often their recent experiences and emotions. For example, a
person who has recently been convicted by police of a speeding traffic offence will have a
different response to questions about the role and value of the police force in general than
someone who has just been saved by the police from an assault. A dramatic presentation of
interviews will demand interpretation of the emotions behind the message.
 It demands of the creators of the drama that they must put themselves in the shoes of the
provider of information and see the results from their point of view. The conventional academic
process of data collection often makes little or no demand upon understanding the data from the
providers’ point of view.
 Drama demands that individual characters in the drama are understood through the eyes of the
other characters. The dramatist makes the character believable by portraying him/her through
the eyes of other characters in the drama. It is a key essence of entrepreneurship to see oneself
through the eyes of key stakeholders.

165

<-----Page 165-----> Messages and information delivered in innovative ways will make a bigger impact and can create
wider understanding. Entrepreneurs often need to use creative ways of delivering messages. TV
advertising is for example drama. A presentation can be dramatic to make an impact.
 Drama provides training in acting skills. Entrepreneurs need to be able to act different roles in
different situations. A good entrepreneur is a good actor. In building relationships with different
stakeholders the entrepreneur will need to act different roles – with a banker, venture capitalist,
government official, employee, regulator, and customer and so on.

4. Outcomes
Participants will have an understanding of the relevance of entrepreneurial mindsets to a
globalised society. They will also have their creative and communicative skills developed by the
drama exercise. They will also understand the importance of emotional intelligence in examining
data.

Example – part summary of English School teacher
Kate is a middle aged married teacher of English in a Secondary school in the UK and is head of
department. She has grown up children and a husband who is an academic in the local
university.

Global
The key global pressures on her work life are reflected in the following:
- The school now has partnership links now with schools in Japan and Russia and is also
engaged in European Community funded programme linking language teachers in several
European countries. Kate has had to arrange exchange trips to several countries and had
the opportunity and responsibility to travel and set these up and accompany groups. She
has had to engage parents, find accommodation and entertain delegations from different
countries. She has also had to arrange special English classes for foreign visiting students
and organise community links and social visits. None of this she gets paid for and it has
eaten considerably into her leisure time.
- The English curriculum has broadened to include a larger number of American authors and
translations of other famous authors. As a result she has had to…….

172

<-----Page 172----->- There is much greater use of IT and most essays now are word processed. There is more
evidence of students ‘borrowing’ texts from the internet and this leads to disputes and
complications in marking……. Kate has had to develop her own IT skills in order to keep
and she really dislikes this……
- There are a wider range of ethnic groups entering the school some of whom do not have
English as a first language. This has meant the development of remedial classes…..

Organisation
- Greater pressure on the school to meet performance targets often driven by international
comparisons. Therefore more testing of students and more paperwork…..
- Schools are on tighter budgets and are expected to behave more like businesses. Kate has
to operate a departmental budget and fight for internal resources. She has now to make
decisions as whether she can afford a new part time teacher to relieve `pressure or buy
more books….
- Schools are becoming more competitive and are competing more also with private sector
education. More care has therefore to be given to marketing the department with parents
so that the best students are not taken elsewhere…… This involves for Kate….
- Performance measures for individual teachers have been introduced following practice in
business. Better teachers, according to these measures, get increased pay. This means
more paperwork and more potential areas of dispute with teachers who do not perform.
Kate has therefore to spend more time……
- There is an increasing problem with children and the use of text messaging in the
classroom. It is difficult to confiscate mobile phones…Kate is trying to set rules that will be
enforceable….
- There are also increasing problems as in most schools with drug taking. This involves more
substantial interaction with parents and at times the police but drug dealers have networks
of young children selling small quantities and will enforce their system with violence at
times….. This involves Kate in…..

Personal
- Kate’s children now work abroad and she has to plan to see her son and daughter and
grandchildren….
- Her husband also increasingly travels overseas and she has to manage the household more
on her own….
- She and her husband do however take more holidays abroad and are seriously thinking of
buying property in Cyprus – but there are still uncertainties about the political future of
that country
- Several of her former close friends have moved away, some overseas, and she is under
pressure to use the internet more to keep in touch – but she hates it!

What kind of Entrepreneurial behaviours will Kate have to pursue?
Why?

BRIEFING FOR INTERVIEW EXERCISE
Exercise with possible Stakeholder Interviewees
The effect of Globalisation has been to create more uncertainty and complexity for many
individuals in many societies. A framework was developed (Annex 1) to demonstrate this, linking
global pressures with changes at the State/Society, Organisational and Individual (worker,
consumer and family) level). It was shown how changes have affected all kinds of individuals in
all kinds of different positions in society (the unemployed, doctors, police, social workers,
teachers etc). Many examples were given (Annex 2). Course participants are asked to explore
this issue by interviewing a stakeholder from the local community for up to two hours on the way
in which they had been affected by the pressures identified in the module. See the list below:

Interviewers must first prepare a relevant framework working with counterparts in the group and
use this as the basis for the interview (see examples below for the kind of areas that might be
used as a basis for interview of different stakeholders. The interview is to be written up in less
than three pages and end with a summary of the key factors creating more uncertainty and
complexity in the interviewee’s environment and a judgement as to the particular
entrepreneurial behaviours that have been stimulated/needed.

GROUP DRAMA PRODUCTION
BRIEFING TO STUDENTS
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
The Message
The production must aim above all to project a message and a number of related points to the
audience.
The message and points can be derived in the following way.
 each individual to take a ‘hot seat’ in the group to describe briefly the stakeholder they
interviewed and to summarise the main uncertainties/complexities now confronting them and
any entrepreneurial behaviours exhibited.
 after this the group should agree what are the key common uncertainties and complexities
and associated behaviours they want to demonstrate in the drama.
 they should also agree an overall message they want to project and associated points. These
must clearly relate to sources of uncertainty and complexity and entrepreneurial
behaviours.
 the story board and drama should be constructed to deliver this message and points.
 when finally agreed they should be written on a flip chart and kept secret. The drama will be
assessed by the audience against these messages/points.
 the storyboard and drama will then be created with the drama facilitator’s help

DRAMA PERFORMANCE - AUDIENCE BRIEFING AND SCORING SYSTEM
KEY THINGS TO LOOK FOR
1. Delivering the Message – did they really deliver it – compare points that came from the class
observations and the ‘intended message’ flip chart points
2. Entertainment – excitement – ‘made me think’ – emotional underpinning of main points –
real empathy/believability with characters –pace – continuity – overall enjoyment?
3. Creativity – imagination in projection of message – use of metaphor – how well combined the
experiences of different people – imaginative use of drama techniques?

<-----Page 178----->37. Use of Programme Evaluation
1. What is Use of Programme Evaluation?
Evaluation has three major conventional aims. Firstly, to feed forward to the future design of
programmes. Secondly, to feed back on the outcomes from programmes to deliver,
beneficiaries, sponsors and participants. Thirdly, to feed back and forward on the management
of programmes. The conventional use of evaluation is therefore as a post-hoc instrument to
measure outcomes and process against planned objectives and ways of achieving them. A fourth,
and perhaps most important component of an evaluation frame, is as a basic instrument for:
establishing programme concept, objectives and planned outcomes; creating a dynamic
evolutionary learning framework; managing and monitoring the whole process; and
communicating with all key stakeholders. This is demonstrated below:
Evaluation schema are conventionally divided into two distinctive parts, Formative evaluation
and Summative evaluation.
Formative (Process) evaluation examines the processes by which the organisation(s) involved in
the activity to be evaluated pursue it and manage.
Summative (Outcome) evaluation seeks to measure the various outcomes at different stages and
facilitates judgement as to the degree to which they were the result of inputs.
The two are interdependent. The issues explored in Formative evaluation are those that impact
directly on the outcomes shown in the Summative exercise. It is the Formative issues that will
determine the capacity of the organisation to continue with the activity when the intervention is
terminated. They focus equally upon issues of effectiveness as well as efficiency.
Formative evaluations focus upon the following key questions:
1. Is there a clear concept behind the intervention -where is the targeted added value from the
intervention and why is it needed? Has it been clearly set out?
2. Has there been a sound process of identification and selection of beneficiaries under the
programme?
3. Have the needs of ultimate and immediate customers/clients (organisations and individuals)
been analysed and grouped meaningfully?
4. How well have the products/services/programmes been designed to meet needs, covering:
- the setting of programme objectives
- the determination of detailed content
- the design of any materials
- the recruitment, selection and development of trainers/service providers
- the proposed style of delivery
5. How sound has been the delivery process it? Covering:
- the competency of those delivering the programme/service
- the process of any counselling, consultancy and follow up
- the choice and use of networks and outside personnel
- location and timing of programme activity
- processes of assessment and accreditation

179

<-----Page 179----->6.

8.
-

Is it clear how the deliverer will reach the market, identified in particular by the process of:
price setting
marketing mix chosen
channels used
PR
selling of the programme
Is there a clear process set out for evaluating success?
How well has the project been organised and managed, in particular the strength of:
budgeting and financing
control systems and measures established
leadership and motivation
organisation design – is it entrepreneurial?
the scope established for innovation and new ideas
the experience base behind the programme and its utilisation
resource acquisition processes
relevant stakeholder engagement
strategic orientation
planning processes
communication to all relevant parties

Summative evaluation measures can be taken at various levels:
1. Reaction of immediate customers to the input, be it training, counselling or a more direct service.
This usually covers issues such as:
- whether customers like the service
- whether they think it is relevant to their jobs/institutions
- whether they think they have learned something
- whether they thought materials were sound
- whether they like the tutors/ service providers
- whether they like the location and amenities
- whether there is lot or little they can use
- whether they thought the workload was just right, too heavy or too light
- whether they would like more and what
- the highs and the lows overall
All the above except the last can be measured on a Likert scale 1 to 5 or 7.
2. Learning Measures. What has been learned by who from the programme inputs in more detail?
This can be measured by asking different groups of participants in a programme, at different
levels, what they think they have learned or what they and their organisation feel they are now
competent to do. This can be done by interview, tests of learning as in an examination or
demonstrated through observation of competency. The key issue here, often neglected, is
whether the learning has been transferred into 'how to' in the recipient’s own life and work
situation as opposed to being regurgitated as per the input.
3. Behaviour Measures, measuring how and why people do things differently. This can be assessed
by questions as to how individuals go about key parts of their work and what has changed as a
result of the input. It can be checked by observation or processes of 360 degree review. In the
case of emphasis upon personal behaviours in common situations (for example counselling) this
may be tested by observation of events or video.

180

<-----Page 180----->4. Intermediate organisation change measures. These seek to measure what has been changed in
terms of organisation practices. For example in the context of micro finance, have there been
new credit rating systems, new forms of marketing, new ways of dealing with customers in
arrears etc. In Business Development Service start up training there would be questions as to
whether there has been start -up and how far down the track the business had proceeded since
the programme.
5. Ultimate level change. This seeks to measure what impact the input activity has had on the
ultimate performance of the organisation (in business context in terms of sales, profits, liquidity,
employment etc).
It is clear that the further that one moves up the hierarchy of Summative evaluation the more
difficult it is to attribute results to any specific programme input, for two major reasons. Firstly,
because of the passage of time needed for the results to permeate. Secondly, because of the
difficulty of attribution resulting from the influence of numerous other factors. It is, for example,
difficult in practice to truly attribute the impact of a start up training course upon the growth and
profitability of a business. Even to attribute the subsequent start of a business to a course may
be difficult unless a perfect match experimental model is used, a situation which is almost
impossible to achieve. Attempts to overcome such problems in order to take cost benefit
measures of inputs are usually so contrived or alternatively so simplistic as to be less than useful.
They are nevertheless extensively used because of the need to justify the funding of
programmes. High ‘scores’ in terms of start up results can of course be achieved by careful
selection.
A major value of summative work therefore lies in using the 'hierarchy' in the process of setting
up a programme of activity designed to help an organisation. For example, by enquiring what
performance targets need to be achieved, what changes may be needed in the organisation to do
this, whose and what behaviours need to change and what therefore needs to be learned, there
will be better design of programmes.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
This is best demonstrated via a Summative example, of evaluation of a broad based
Entrepreneurship University Development Programme.

Ultimate Level Outcomes
For the University to contribute substantially to the long run competitiveness of the economy and
social cohesion in UK society via a process designed to enhance its contribution to the Enterprise
Culture.

181

<-----Page 181----->The measurable outcomes must be based upon the notion that UK competitiveness in the long
run will be enhanced by the capacities of the graduate population to contribute more
substantially to the development of the independent business sector and to the entrepreneurial

The above exercise provides the basic targets for the programme design
4 as well as a focus for
evaluation at various summative levels. A Formative evaluation of the4 same programme would
follow the format as noted earlier.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Entrepreneurial learning is essentially focused upon ‘doing things’. The evaluation framework
described above is outcomes focused as well as entrepreneurial process focused. It has been
noted above that the main value of the framework is in its use in the initial design of the
programme not just a means of post–hoc measurement. By this means, even though it may not
be possible to convincingly demonstrate the impact of a programme on outcomes at higher levels
of the summative hierarchy, it will be possible to demonstrate that the programme was clearly
focused in its design upon these.

4. Outcomes
The main outcome is a tool that can be used to clearly focus a programme right from the
beginning and to demonstrate to sponsors what can and what cannot be usefully measured.

184

<-----Page 184----->38. Use of the Quiz
1. What is Use of the Quiz?
A quiz is usually a set of knowledge questions covering a particular body of knowledge. A quiz
may also be used to test attitudes to a number of issues or areas of concern (for example a quiz
about beliefs) or about how other people see things: In general the quiz serves a number of
useful purposes. It can be used at the beginning of a programme to test the existing knowledge
base of the students. It is therefore a vehicle for discussing the proposed learning objectives in a
module. It can be used at the end of a module to test learning. It can be used as a vehicle for the
facilitator to bring out areas of contested ‘fact’ – for example what is the meaning of failure and
what are the problems in measuring it? It can be an instrument for motivating the students to
learn. It constitutes a more interesting means for students to acquire otherwise ‘boring’ facts.
The quiz can also be used as a means of students setting up their own testing of learning or
indeed testing the knowledge of the facilitator! It can be used as a means of ‘teaching’ how to
develop appropriate questionnaires and to explore some of the pitfalls in this process.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The quiz shown in the Annex below was used as part of an introduction to an Entrepreneurship
Module on an MBA programme at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai,
China. The aim was not only to test the existing knowledge of the students but also to surprise
them about the role that small businesses had played in Chinese economic development in the
previous 20 years. The results of the quiz were therefore a starting point for discussion as to why
this was so and how it had happened. In the UK context it is relatively easy to develop a similar
small business quiz as part of an introduction to a programme.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The quiz enables the existing knowledge base to be tested. It therefore provides the facilitator
with knowledge as to the thresholds of learning of the students. It is obviously a means for
engagement of students in the learning process and for sharing with them the learning
objectives.

4. Outcomes
That students are given a clear framework for the learning that is to take place and have the
opportunity to question it.

<-----Page 187----->39. Use of Undertaking an Institutional Audit
1. What is Use of Undertaking an Institutional Audit?
There is wide agreement that the impact of any entrepreneurial education initiative is dependent
upon the culture and structure of the organisation within which it is implemented. It is also clear
that, in the Further and Higher Education context there are numerous initiatives that are being
pursued in the organisation of an entrepreneurial nature upon which educational initiatives can
build. Examples include: careers service programmes; knowledge transfer activities; science and
technology park developments; business and industry information services; research; students
projects; alumni engagement; visiting fellowships; publications; individual consultancies; and
secondments. Finding entrepreneurial activities already being undertaken in the organisation
and the people pursuing them is a key strategic step for the entrepreneurial educator, providing
the opportunity for their engagement in partnerships, adding value to their existing activity. In
addition it will be important to explore the formal strategic commitment of the organisation to
entrepreneurial activities, for example active contribution to regional development and
substantial concern for the use of knowledge generated in the organisation and reward systems
designed to underpin this.
The institutional audit is therefore a means for identification of key opportunities for the
educator.

2. How is the exercise conducted?
An Audit can be conducted by questionnaire, and/or by personal interview or merely, to be begin
with, by casual enquiry and estimation. An example of an Audit Framework is shown below,
focused upon the last mentioned approach. It is designed to test the awareness of the educator,
of the culture and structure of the institution in supporting entrepreneurial activity and, as such,
provides the basis for building a strategy. Reflecting the strategic orientation, the final column
provides the analyst with the opportunity to assign priorities for influence in relation to their own
capacity and resource.

<-----Page 191----->40. Use of Sales Pitch
1. What is Use of Sales Pitch?
The sales pitch is an exercise in selling a proposition to a potential buyer. This might be a
customer for a product or service or a stakeholder who may invest in, or support in kind, a

venture.
2. How is the exercise constructed?
The aim of the exercise is to underline the importance of, and develop the capacity for, selling a
proposition in a short snappy and attractive way. A group can be charged with preparing a sales
pitch with one or two of their members to deliver. The customer can be a representative of
another group playing a role or an external representing a ‘real’ client.
In the context of developing entrepreneurship education programmes it is important to recognise
that there are a wide range of stakeholders who can support a programme in cash or in kind.
These include Regional Development Agencies, Local Government, independent and corporate
businesses, bankers, accountants, the legal professions and local None Government
Organisations (NGOs) such as Local Enterprise Agencies. All of these have an interest in
developing graduate entrepreneurship. Their needs, and therefore their reasons for offering any
support, may vary. Sales pitch needs to consider carefully the differential nature of stakeholder
needs. The group working on the sales pitch will be given a short time to brainstorm on the
client needs, how the ‘offer’ should be designed to meet these, and also why the client might not
‘buy’ The sales pitch has to present a Unique Selling Proposition (USP) offer to the client in an
attractive manner.
An equal consideration is to recognise in preparing the pitch that the reaction will not only be to
the argument but will also be conditioned by reaction to the person presenting and also will be a
function of the clients’ views and prejudices as to the capacity of the organisation which the
‘pitcher’ represents. In the above example there may be a prejudice against educational
institutions having enough practical experience to teach entrepreneurship. Such prejudices will
have to be anticipated and taken into account in designing the pitch.
The pitch is then appraised by the client group or individual.
The exercise can be used in similar fashion in a wide variety of different contexts, for example
selling a business idea.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus is upon empathy with a client’s needs. It is also about putting together a persuasive
argument in a short time under pressure. It is also developing team-work to reach agreement on
an issue very quickly.

192

<-----Page 192----->4. Outcomes
A key Outcome is recognition of the need to identify different needs of different stakeholders
and therefore to package an argument in different ways. The sales pitch is seen as a relationship
development instrument and as a means not only of selling something but as a vehicle for
building trust.

193

<-----Page 193----->41. Use of Polls
1. What is ‘Use of polls’?
A poll is a means of engaging the audience in an issue which is being discussed/presented. It is
particularly useful when there are large numbers of participants. It can be used in a number of
ways:
a.
to obtain a view of how much the audience already knows about an issue
b.
to learn what the audience already thinks about an issue
c.
to identify the needs of the audience relating to personal or organisational
development

2. How is the exercise constructed?
This is usually by a simple questionnaire which can be quickly and easily answered – usually of a
simple scoring nature (agree or disagree or via a Likert scale). It can be delivered in class or
circulated beforehand and the results collated to provide a basis for framing discussion. If the
technology is available it can be used as an interactive device to get audience/class participation
by the pressing of a button.
An example, used on the programme, is to question participants as to how they see progress in
entrepreneurship education in key areas in their institutions. The results form a basis for
discussion as what needs to be done, which are the major areas for action and what actions can
be taken.
A poll can also be used as a means of focusing a particular session on needs as identified by the
audience, For example an audience of entrepreneurs can be polled prior to or during a
programme about key problems or opportunities facing them, It can also be used as a straw poll
feedback evaluation – what do you think?

3.

Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The poll provokes engagement of the participants/audience; It is a vehicle for developing creative
problem solving based upon what the participants think. It is also a vehicle for stimulating peer
learning as it becomes evident to the individual whether or not they are mainstream on an issue
and therefore will provoke thinking and interaction. It also gives ownership of the learning
agenda to the participants and demonstrates that the session is relevant to the needs/views of
the group.

4. Outcomes
There is a stimulus to action resulting from peer pressure. There is also a stimulus to learning
from the others in the group who may have a more advanced or different perspective on an
issue.

194

<-----Page 194----->42. Use of Simulating Entrepreneurial ‘Ways of’
1. What is Use of Simulating Entrepreneurial ‘Ways of’
It can be argued that a key component missing from much entrepreneurship education is the
creation of a ‘feel’ for the way that entrepreneurs do, learn, feel, see, think, organise and
communicate things. Drawing from a varied literature it can be argued that, as a result of the
close identity of the owner-managed a firm with the business, certain values are built interacting
with, and developed from, a range of experience. ‘Ways of’ can be characterised as3:

Possible ways of achieving measurable outcomes related to ‘Ways of’ include:
Ways of doing






Mini cases/critical incidents calling upon students to take decisions with limited data
Following the development of frames of reference in class (the start up process – of any
kind of organisation being one) judgements made as to possibility of success and
reasons given (no business plans!)
Creating a convincing argument for something with limited information – off the top of
the head in a limited time space
Giving students a particular problem and asking them to identify as many opportunities
for solving it as possible – for example drugs in night clubs, nothing for young people to
do in the evening in their local community
Seeing all activities/opportunities as know who – being about identifying relevant
stakeholders, empathising with their needs and points of view and developing
strategies for carrying the opportunity forward. For example, setting the students the
objective of setting up a college disco – identifying who they need to persuade, what
the pros and cons seen from each of these individuals point of view might be, deciding
who best to use to persuade others etc (possible key stakeholders being teachers,
principals, parents, caretakers, canteen staff, local police, local householders, possible
stewards, local authorities re noise etc)

Ways of communicating




asking students to make a persuasive verbal case for something, thinking on their feet, at

whether a person on a video is trustworthy
feedback on role play of a person in very different situations (for example re the disco
exercise above how should one ‘appear’ before a head teacher, police inspector, chairman
of governors, school caretaker). The enterprising person/entrepreneur is a good actor

simple exercise to test understanding of the life world of a person (what changes in the
life of a teacher who decides to become self employed?)
exercise in understanding how strong ownership of an idea or ideology might influence
the way people present and defend their actions. Using, for example, a craftsperson
whose work is criticised in a newspaper to get the student to understand how it might
feel when someone really owns’ something yet has it threatened. Use of video or mini
incident and check responses
write a short story around a picture of two people at a table where one is trying to
persuade the other to do something that he/she thinks is unethical
selecting two of your friends/acquaintances (using fictitious names) explain why you
might trust one more than the other
given a list of entrepreneurial values explain why these should be so
given a particular job description and two candidates, one with a great deal of formal
qualification and the other with a great deal of experience, how would you go about
assessing the two?

take a family incident and get the student to explore the impact of different feelings
upon the way different members of the family see the incident (I want to set up my own
business says the young daughter).
explain why entrepreneurs do not like bureaucrats

Ways of thinking






use some of de Bono’s lateral thinking exercises
ask students to construct heuristic frames of reference for making intuitive judgements
of different kinds of events – for example how to you assess how to trust someone?)
ask students to provide examples of different kinds of entrepreneurial experiences they
have had selecting from a list and ask them to evaluate results (for example, have they
ever tried to sell something, persuade someone to do something against their will,
defend something that you really believed was right but others felt was wrong)
explain what the use of some particular piece of knowledge might be to whom and why?

Ways of organising






explain how to design an organisation so that people can be very enterprising
explain how to design an organisation to suppress enterprise
explain whether you think the university/college is enterprising and why or why not
make a drawing showing what you believe to be the culture of the university/college
and explain it
plan a project to determine the needs of older people in the community and how they
can be met

Ways of seeing






students assume that they have to have to create their own living and wealth by hard
work and independent effort with little support. Asked to indicate how, this might
influence attitudes to increased taxation, a tax on inheritance, public expenditure on
subsidies to the unemployed.
students are asked to assume that they are the boss of a small firm employing 14
people, many of whom have been with it for 20 years. A government scheme is
introduced to encourage every employer to formally train every member of staff, keep
records of all training events and undertake formal training needs analysis. You, as an
employer, are asked to contribute a percentage of your labour costs in the form of a
payroll tax to pay for this. If you complete all the paper work, keep records and send
your workers on formal training courses you will recoup most, if not all, of the tax. Why
should you object to this?
students assume they have many years of experience in doing something and have been
reasonably successful. An expert comes along and sets out new ways of doing things
based upon objective analysis and theory. What will be your attitude to this and why?

students are given a two-page summary of an idea for a business which is full of errors
and are asked, without adding to the word count, to amend it so that it is more
plausible.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The focus of all of the exercises is that of creating/simulating aspects of the considered ways that
entrepreneurs might approach different problems and opportunities. The aim is to create
empathy with this world by ‘doing’.

4. Outcomes
Programme participants will gain a true ‘feel’ as to the way that SME owner/managers might see
and do things and the rationale for their ‘ways of behaving’.

<-----Page 199----->43. Use of Simulating the Entrepreneurial ‘Life world’
1. What is Use of Simulating the Entrepreneurial Life World?
Most of the emphasis in New Venture Programmes is upon the business aspects of the start up
process. There is, usually, a strong focus upon preparing the business plan. Traditionally, there
has been little concern with preparing individuals for their transition into a ‘life-world’ of
becoming an independent entrepreneur. Many aspects of their world will change – a situation
for which they are often ill prepared. If, for example, one moves from employment to selfemployment then key changes may include:


Greater freedom/independence to choose ways of doing things
Greater individual responsibility for shaping one’s own world
Greater personal ownership of events
Personal financial assets at risk and risk in disbursement
Other personal assets may be at risk (e.g. house)
Ego being more at risk as business idea exposed
Personal responsibility for all outcomes
Having to cope with more uncertainty on a day to day basis
Greater personal vulnerability to changes in the environment and how to cope
Greater pressure to take initiative/make things happen in work and home life
Need to flexibly undertake a wide range of tasks
Rewards directly linked to effort
Need to manage a interdependency with a range of people with ‘know who’ and trust
the key
A situation where work, social and family life are more integrated
Changes in friendship patterns
Greater links between personal effort and social status
More learning by doing and responsibility for learning
Need to cope with loneliness
Need to work flexible and (often) long hours

It is a challenge to the educator to prepare programme participants for this.

2. How is the exercise constructed?
Several methods might be used initially to create awareness as follows:
i. By asking participants to interview a recent new entrepreneur about ‘what has changed’ and
how they have coped. Then to discuss the different issues that have arisen from the
interviews in groups with the focus upon identifying what seem to be the most important
aspects of being able to cope and ‘how do we get that experience’. This can be followed by
asking participants, if they are themselves in the process of moving into a new venture, what
they expect will change and how they think they will cope with it – perhaps writing a ‘self
reflection’ note. Alternatively participants can be asked to interview each other in this
context.
ii. By asking new entrepreneurs into the class for ‘interview’ about their world’ changes and
how they have coped. This is perhaps best done in small groups to create a more intimate
personal atmosphere.
iii. By use of an initial ‘critical incident’ approach as below:
200

Aim: to stimulate group discussion of the life world of the entrepreneur.

Key Question for Focus
What changes in one’s ‘way of life’ when one moves from employment to self employment?
Kate is a young single woman of 25 years of age. She graduated from University two years
ago with a 2.1 degree in design – focused upon ceramics. She had always had a considerable
talent for art and design demonstrated from an early age. She had worked herself up the
educational ladder in creative design by successful progress through further education, to a
Polytechnic and then to University.
Upon graduating she took a post at a school teaching ceramics but soon decided that this life
was not for her. She wanted more independence. With the help of a small legacy from her
grandmother she set up her own studio, complete with kiln and embarked on a career in self
employment.

What changed in her life-world as a result of this move?
The facilitator can draw from the group a list of changes which can be used for discussion of the
nature of uncertainties and complexities facing the entrepreneur and the skills and attributes
that might be needed to deal with them. The group can be asked to speculate to what degree
her previous work and life experience might have helped her to cope. For example, if she comes
from a background of family business she may well be familiar with many of the aspects of the
life world noted above. This can lead on to a discussion of why it is that one is more disposed to
set up a business if one comes from an SME family. It might also be useful to explore what
aspects of the life world of being a teacher, prepares one for entrepreneurship and which do not.

3. Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
Understanding of the entrepreneurial life world is a much neglected area of entrepreneurial
teaching. It is critical that learners appreciate the context in which entrepreneurial decisions are
made.

4. Outcomes
Entrepreneurial outcomes are all served by an appreciation of the entrepreneurial ‘life world’.
The situation in which an entrepreneur operates is a specific one for which there is little
preparation which traditional courses, even those focusing upon teaching ‘for’ entrepreneurship.

202

<-----Page 202----->8. Next Steps
Determining the pedagogy is a key part of any learning and teaching strategy however this only
forms part of the considerations within an effective learning strategy. Whilst this compendium
contains 44 pedagogical notes which form the basis for curriculum development, evidence suggests
that students need to value their learning and within the educational system, assessment feedback
and marks are the ‘currency’ that will motivate learners. Therefore the experience of NCGE in the
UK indicates that entrepreneurial learning needs to be clearly demonstrated as part of the learning
experience in the entrepreneurial learning outcomes, and assessed to recognise and reward effort
and results.
To build an entrepreneurial mindset, the educational approach of ‘constructive alignment’ (Biggs
1996; 2003) will support the development of an effective learning strategy. Biggs advocates an
alignment which sees the learning outcome, once crafted, aligned the assessment strategy. Strong
and demonstrable alignment between intended learning outcomes and assessment processes and
criteria will support the development of ‘fit-for-purpose’ assessment (Race 2007). With the inclusion
of appropriate pedagogy, the following linkages are apparent:

(Adapted from Baume, 2009)
To support the development of appropriate assessment, the final guide will be now exploring these
issues within entrepreneurial education.

44.Use of Assessment of Entrepreneurial Learning
1. What is Use of Assessment of Learning?
In general, conventional approaches to assessment of learning serve three major purposes:
1. To indicate to the facilitator of learning whether goals have been achieved: if so why so, and
if not why not?
2. As a means for students to assess their own progress in learning.
3. As a means for grading of pupils for purposes of accreditation (meeting standards).

203

<-----Page 203----->Assessments are usually undertaken by the teacher or facilitator. An estimated 80% of assessments
in Higher Education are undertaken by examination, essay or report writing methods. They
represent a process of benchmarking students against each other with the ultimate goal of
facilitating grading of students into degree categories. Research also indicates that very often the
students are not absolutely clear on the standards and criteria being used for this benchmarking
process.
There is much criticism of these forms of assessment within the education literature particularly in
terms of experiential learning (Race 2007). In an entrepreneurship education context it can be
argued that the assessment process should be one that helps to develop entrepreneurial capacities
and understanding of the life world of the entrepreneur. This involves therefore designing methods
of assessment that:
 provide greater ownership and control to the learner
 allow learning from mistakes
 involve opportunity for repeat practice by ‘doing’
 involve exposure to a wider range of stakeholder assessors
 build commitment to see things through and improve
 build confidence and motivation
 encourage assessment by problem solving
 set clear targets and opportunity for improvement
 formulate assessments in terms of student knowledge of ‘how-to’ do things
 encourage students to understand the meaning of what they learn in different contexts and
to different people/stakeholders
There is much educational research to support the view that true understanding only comes about
through application of knowledge to practice and argument. Knowledge is internalised via a process
of the brain constructing ‘mind maps’ in the long term memory which form the basis for application
of knowledge to different contexts

2. How is the exercise constructed?
The major focus will need to be upon enhancing capacity for self assessment and peer assessment.
This is not always easy within the academic convention but there are a number of ways of moving
closer to this:

taking time out at the beginning of a programme to allow students to familiarise themselves
with ‘how to’ deconstruct pieces of work undertaken by former students and develop their own
frameworks for assessment and setting of standards

similarly, rehearsing students in critiquing academic articles and setting standards for
appraisal and exploring how to best use academic work

getting students to develop frameworks for assessing the written work of the facilitator and
discussing this

getting students, by use of questionnaires and assessment forms, to critique the work of
others. This is best done anonymously, or within clear parameters.
 provide facilities for students to truly expose their work to stakeholders and undertake prior
preparation for such exercises by group brainstorming exercises on how and why stakeholders
might see the work and assess it
 getting students to rehearse delivery of the results of a project via presentations and role play of
different potential user groups
 instead of just marking a project and then moving on, provide feedback and discussion and then
get the students to do it again – and again?
204

<-----Page 204----->





before asking students to write a piece of work or project show them examples of best practice
and have discussions of these and practice marking them
provide a set of agreed criteria in relation to a standard and allow the students to mark their
own work against this, indicating what they feel they have yet to learn
engage stakeholders in a none-threatening manner to take part in open discursive assessments.
For this they will need training and guidance to facilitate appropriately.
set standards relating to the application of knowledge from the beginning of a programme
making clear that the end results will be measured in terms of knowledge of ‘how –to’.
set out standards and discuss for different types of work. For example ‘what makes a sound
consultant report’

3 Relevance to Entrepreneurial Learning
The aim of the above is to provide the means for moving the learning process nearer to an
entrepreneurial mode. In particular to seek to simulate more closely the way that entrepreneurs
themselves acquire and assess their learning, by doing, benchmarking personally against peers and
competitors, by trial and error, by bouncing their ideas and offers off stakeholders in different
contexts and by testing their mind maps of ways of seeing and doing things by a process of constant
practice and reiteration.

4 Outcomes
Students will be better able to take charge of their own learning and therefore be better equipped
for a process of Life-Long Learning. They will also be more strongly motivated to learn not just for
the sake of passing exams. Facilitators of learning will also be in a better learning position
themselves.
Three approaches which illustrate this approach are contained within the appendix 2.

205

<-----Page 205----->Summary
This compendium provides an overview of the psychological and educational foundations for
teaching to support the development of the entrepreneurial mindset. By first defining enterprise,
entrepreneurship and innovation, the concept of entrepreneurial teaching is developed to support
the delivery of entrepreneurial learning outcomes. These are designed to develop an
entrepreneurial mindset which can be employed within a range of contexts, which include, but are
not exclusive to, small business start-up. This seeks to create an ability to apply learning – the
enhanced capability to take action and behave – rather than purely upon the conventional delivery,
testing and critical assessment of knowledge inputs. This creates entrepreneurial learning that
offers an ‘integrated, embedded enterprise experience’ (Price 2005) that builds knowledge, attitude
and skills, whilst exposing the student to the entrepreneurial life world (how it ‘feels’ to be an
entrepreneur) – an otherwise neglected issue (Gibb, 2002, Cope, 2006, Cope and Pittaway, 2007).
To support the educator with their choice of pedagogies, 3 route maps are provided to help
educators reach that ‘near entrepreneurial experience’ (Ohe 1996) within the safe environment of
the classroom. These route maps are provided to a high level of accessibility for the educator, which
together with their standardised format, allow for changes to be made in the classroom, with
learners, immediately.
Although the focus of entrepreneurial teaching is on ‘small group learning’, as the optimum method
for supporting the development of higher level skills within learners (Kolb 1984), route map 3 is also
designed to provide inspiration to those constrained by working in large lecture theatres, or seeking
to create blended learning within their learning strategy. However it is critical that the educator
seeks to achieve higher level skill development, within their students, through experiential learning
which is recognised to be the most effective when the learner is actively engaged with the learning
process. Seeking this level high of engagement should then be the driver to selecting the most
appropriate pedagogy for each outcome, and become the foundation of an entrepreneurial learning
strategy (assessment; activity; outcome, Baume 2008).
Adaptation and experimentation is then the key, embedding these pedagogies within your teaching
and working through the constraints that class sizes and timetabling made provide. However, by
using the entrepreneurial learning outcomes and aligning your choice of pedagogy to reach these,
you can support the development of a life-long entrepreneurial mindset in your students.

<-----Page 207----->Appendix 2: 3 examples of entrepreneurial assessment
Example 1: Entrepreneurial Assessment for Pedagogical Note: ‘Exploring the Enterprise Culture in a
Globalisation Context’: The use of Drama
Stage 1 Aim: to give the students ownership of standards and marking criteria.
Students are asked to read a paper as background to a Masters Module on the Entrepreneurial
Society.
Attached is a background paper to the module.
Please read carefully
As Group Work in the next session you will be asked to critique this paper.
The key tasks for the groups will be:
1. To establish a set of criteria for assessing an academic paper such as this.
2. To determine, in the light of these criteria, how you would allocate marks to different
components out of a total of 100.
3. To mark the paper accordingly.
4. To present your view of what makes a good academic paper, how you set criteria to
establish this, and how you allocated different weights in a marking system and what mark
you gave to it and why?
This exercise is ultimately conducted in class and at the end there is a full discussion and attempt to
obtain agreement (under tutor guidance) as to what constitutes a sound paper and a good marking
schedule. This is then written up by the tutor and handed out.
Stage 2 Aim: to assist students to personally internalise and see the relevance of learning.
Using the paper as a guide students are the asked to write a short essay, using the framework in the
paper, as to the impact of the issues mentioned in the paper on their own life world to date and
their work and social/community futures. The issues raised are then discussed in class.
Stage 3 Aim: to help students explore and understand the wider context of entrepreneurship and
use empathy in creating frameworks for interview.
Students are asked to go out and individually interview a random set of persons in society about the
impact of globalisation on their work, personal and social lives. They are given examples as
standards for discussion in class and then work in small groups to help each other to create frames
for interviews of different types of people.
Stage 4 Aim: to help students understand the standard and how they will be assessed and marked.
Students are handed out an example of a very good write up of an interview and asked to discuss
why this is deemed good. The tutor then goes through the example with the aim, via discussion, of
producing a marking frame and bring to the attention of students why they lose marks. In particular,
to underpin the notion that the focus of the interview and write up is not on what the interviewee
thinks about the issues of globalisation but what is happening to them as a result.

208

<-----Page 208----->Stage 5 Aim: to indicate how the knowledge gained in the interview will be used via a drama process
and why this is important.
Students are led into a twofold brainstorming discussion. First, on the use of drama and what they
see as the use of this in an entrepreneurship context; then second, why a drama exercise is
important to academic work. The discussion will focus here upon the emotional and subjective
nature of all responses to questionnaires and interviews. Also that academics rarely go back to their
interviewee and ask, ‘Is that what you really meant?’ Therefore they are to be asked to put
themselves inside the shoes of the interviewee and also watch for the body language during the
interview.
Stage 6 Aim: to get students to take ownership of their learning from the interview, get them to
synthesise and discuss with others and create meaning out of it.
Students are asked. in facilitated groups, to role play in a ‘hot seat’ their interviewee, then
determine key common messages for their interviews, develop a message and a metaphor and build
and perform a drama.
Stage 7 Aim: to create a framework for a peer assessment process.
Also discussed at this stage is that the drama will be peer assessed. The marking, methods and
criteria for assessment are discussed. Students are given examples of previously assessed dramas
and these are discussed. This enables the tutor to warn as to problems that might occur (for
example, that in the excitement of creativity and entertainment, the message is lost).
Stage 8 Aim: to review relevance of learning and the use of drama.
After performance the class is debriefed on:

what they feel that they have learned in respect of the relevance of entrepreneurial
behaviours and culture to society;

what they ‘feel’ about the drama process and their own personal reactions as to what they
have got out of it (if anything);

what they think about the use of drama in the promotion of business and other
organisations
