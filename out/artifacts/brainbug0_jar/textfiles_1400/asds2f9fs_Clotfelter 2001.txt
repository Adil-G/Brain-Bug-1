Abstract
This paper examines patterns of alumni giving, using data on two cohorts of former students from a sample of
private colleges and universities. Higher levels of contributions are associated with higher income, whether or not the
person graduated from the institution where he or she first attended college, and the degree of satisfaction with his or
her undergraduate experience. Their satisfaction in turn was a function of particular aspects of that experience, including
whether there was someone who took a special interest when he or she was enrolled there. Among the more recent
cohort of graduates, those who had received need-based aid tended to give less and those who were related to former
alumni tended to give more.

1. Introduction
In the sizable empirical literature on the economics of
charitable giving, most studies have examined the importance of income and tax deductibility on total contributions. Owing to the widespread use of tax return data,
few studies have examined particular kinds of giving.1
Nor is it common for these studies to examine any
aspects of the connection of the donor to the donee institution. Yet the sociological literature on giving behavior
suggests that such personal connections are quite
important in determining the pattern and amount of indi-

vidual giving, particularly for the affluent.2 The current
paper utilizes a new data set that makes it possible to
examine in more detail one category of charitable giving:
the donations of alumni to highly selective private colleges and universities. Although the data do not offer
the income and tax detail found in most studies of total
contributions, they do provide an unusually rich description of personal connections between donor and donee
organization and thus offer new insights on the economics of charitable giving. And, in light of the growing
importance of private donations to colleges and universities, the findings are of special importance for higher
education in general.
The data are based on the College and Beyond survey,
which collected information for three cohorts of individuals who enrolled in a sample of 34 colleges and univer-

sities in 1951, 1976, and 1989.3 These individuals were
surveyed in 1995 and 1996 and were asked questions
covering both their college experience and aspects of
their current situation. For a subset of 14 of these institutions (all of them private and most of them quite
selective), data were collected from the institution’s own
administrative files on each person’s contributions for a
number of years. Although not all of the individuals in
this resulting sample graduated from these colleges and
universities, the vast majority did, and so they are
referred to throughout the paper as alumni.
The resulting data set provides an excellent opportunity not only to supplement our knowledge about the
factors that affect charitable giving but also to provide
insight into what has become a significant source of revenue for private colleges and universities. In the
1999/2000 academic year, alumni contributed $4.0
billion to 566 private institutions, representing 8.6% of
those institutions’ educational and general expenditures
(Morgan & Kaplan, 2001, pp. 38–39). And, in light of
the decade-long increases in stock prices and the success
of university capital campaigns, despite recent reversals,
the portion of total income from donations seems likely
to grow. Indeed, donations assume a prominent role in
Winston’s (1999) analysis of finance and market competition in higher education, providing a crucial source of
funding for the substantial subsidies to students, particularly at elite institutions. Writes Winston, “The bottom
line for any school is its access to the donative wealth
that buys quality and position” (p. 30).
The College and Beyond data make it possible to
explore the connection between an individual’s experience with the institution—in this case, largely the experience of having been a student—and subsequent giving
behavior. Analyzed in cross-section equations, the data
set offers several possible measures of student experience to use in answering this question. It also affords an
opportunity to examine two very pragmatic questions.
One issue that has elicited increasing hand-wringing at
private institutions is whether those who accumulate debt
from student loans will be less likely to make contributions once they graduate, or whether those who receive
financial aid will be more generous in the future, in recognition of the financial assistance they received as students. A related issue applies to the preference in admissions commonly accorded to the sons and daughters of
alumni. Private institutions may be interested in knowing
how these so-called legacies will behave once they
become alumni. Although private institutions have, and
continue to show, a preference for children of alumni,
there is evidence that this and other non-meritocratic cri-

of the survey.

teria may have become less important over time.4 If this
is so, and if it implies a shift in the affluence of students
attending private institutions, such changes in admissions
policies could have long-term implications for alumni
giving.
Because it tracks donations over a number of years,
the present data set also makes it possible to examine
the effect of factors that may influence changes over time
in giving, such as variation in the average tax price of
giving caused by changes in the tax law and the performance of the stock market. A third possible temporal effect
arises from the common practice among many institutions to place special emphasis on reunion years—
those divisible by five.
To provide a background for the present analysis, Section 2 of the paper reviews some of the existing literature
regarding alumni giving. Section 3 describes the data set
and the definitions of some of the variables used. Section
4 describes regression analysis of alumni satisfaction
with their undergraduate college experiences and giving
over a five-year period. Section 5 takes advantage of the
annual data on gifts by individual alumni to explore the
implications for timing of gifts and the effect of changes
in stock prices. The concluding section summarizes the
findings and notes questions that are not addressed in
the paper.

2. Research on alumni giving
Studies of giving by alumni constitute a proper subset
of a much larger economic literature on charitable giving. Prominent among the general explanations offered
for the apparently anomalous act of giving money away
include these: donors give because they care about the
well-being of recipients (e.g., Becker, 1974); contributions are merely a payment for recognition and
organized flattery (e.g., Yoo & Harrison, 1989); donors
derive utility from the act of giving itself (e.g., Andreoni,
1990); donors give in response to social pressure (e.g.,
Keating, Pitts, & Appel, 1981); and giving is motivated
by commitment, not utility maximization (Sen, 1978).
For the most part, theoretical perspectives such as these
are fully consistent with neoclassical models of consumer behavior. Just as empirical demand studies
uncover conventional income and price effects for products that may be valued for complex and deeply
psychological reasons, empirical work has demonstrated
that charitable giving is also sensitive to variations in
price and income, in addition to other, more particular
factors.
More than a few of the empirical studies of charitable
giving have focused on alumni contributions to colleges

and universities. This research shows that, not only does
the amount contributed tend to rise with an individual’s
income, so does the probability of making any gift at
all.5 As in the more general studies of charitable giving,
the level of contributions also tends to rise with age, or
years since graduation.6 Studies of alumni giving also
reflect the tradition of making (and asking for) major
gifts in “reunion years,” the years since graduation that
are multiples of five. All of the studies that present giving by class clearly reveal this regularity.7 Other studies
have shown the importance of fraternities (Harrison, Mitchell, & Peterson, 1995) and family ties to the institution
(Okunade & Berl, 1997). More generally, some studies
have recognized that giving depends in large part on subjective feelings about the institution, that is, the degree
to which an alumnus identifies with it. However, as Mael
and Ashforth (1992, p.106) state, “surprisingly little is
known about the factors which affect alumni attachment
and involvement.”

3. Data
As noted above, the College and Beyond study
covered three entering cohorts of college students at a
total of 34 colleges and universities.8 Each of these institutions agreed to participate in the study, having been
guaranteed by the sponsor, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, that the anonymity of the individuals would be
respected and that calculations comparing institutions
would not be published. For all but the largest of these
institutions, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.
attempted to survey by mail every person who enrolled
in the falls of 1951, 1976, and 1989. For each former
student the information collected in the survey question5
See, for example, Okunade and Berl (1997). Indeed, the
assumption that alumni income strongly influences alumni giving lies behind Willemain, Goyal, Van Deven and Thukral’s
(1994) speculation about what they view as the democratization
of admissions at Princeton during the 920s. They argue that
changes in admissions practices reduced the prevalence of students from wealthy families at Princeton, resulting in a decline
in the average size of gifts.
6
Grant and Lindauer (1986), Bristol (1990 and 1991–92),
and Okunade and Berl (1997) offer examples of measurable
age effects.

naire was joined with the student records maintained by
the institutions, including such items as courses taken,
extra-curricular activities, and honors received.9
For a subset of 20 of the private institutions in the
sample, additional information was requested on alumni
donations contained in the institutions’ own administrative records. Information was received from 14 of these
institutions, and it is records from these institutions that
constitute the data set used in the current study. Of those
14 colleges and universities, three contain data only on
the 1976 cohort. All together, the data set covers a total
sample of 2910 individuals for the 1951 cohort and 9304
for the 1976 cohort. Because most of the 1989 cohort
had only just graduated when the survey was conducted,
and therefore would have had little opportunity to establish giving patterns, that cohort is omitted from most of
the analysis. The number of years of giving data covered
differs from institution to institution,10 but most of the
institutions provided giving data, at a minimum, for all
of the years from 1991 to 1995.11
Variables were defined using both the survey and
institutional information. Information was available for
most individuals on household income, marital status,
number of children, occupation of parents, sector of
employment, type of high school attended, high school
rank, SAT score (for the 1976 cohort only), college
major, honors received, graduation status, post-graduate
degrees, aspects of the undergraduate experience, and
several attitudinal questions. Also defined, and used in
estimating equations, are institution-specific dummy
variables, but statistics corresponding to them are not
shown in the paper.
An interesting feature of these data is the opportunity
they offer to compare the behavior of individuals in two
different generations—one that experienced World War
II as teenagers, the other, the end of the Vietnam War.

See Bowen and Bok (1998, Appendix A) for a description
of the survey and methodology employed.
10
An important practical question that arose in using the data
on alumni giving provided by institutions was how to determine
whether the absence of recorded giving by an individual
reflected no contributions by the individual or merely the lack
of giving data. Institutions were asked to indicate for each individual whether giving data were available; conversations with
those who provided and collected the data suggested that this
indicator was not reliable. Instead, the assumption was made
that missing data would be assumed to indicate true zero giving,
except in cases in which the institution provided no giving data
for any donors, such as was the case for three institutions for
all of the 1951 cohort, and several other institutions for some
years and cohorts.
11
One institution with information only on its 1976 cohort
had no data for 1995, necessitating its exclusion from Table 1,
but in regressions explaining average giving over the period
1991–1995, this institution was included, using the average giving over the four years available.

They differ as well, obviously, in their ages during the
period of study. When they were surveyed, the members
of these two cohorts were, on average, 62 and 37 years
old, respectively, in 1995. It is possible that members of
the two cohorts differed in other ways as well, particularly if elite private institutions changed their admissions criteria between 1951 and 1976. In fact, some
changes did occur, with institutions accepting increasing
proportions of women and racial minorities and drawing
students from wider geographic areas. In 1995, 49.9%
of those in the 1951 cohort made gifts to their alma maters; those who made gifts averaged $1506 in contributions. For the 1976 cohort, only 31.7% made gifts in
1995, with an average of $681 for those who gave anything. Despite these large differences, it is impossible to
conclude from these data alone that one cohort was more
“generous” than the other, since they were observed at
different ages. In their study of alumni giving to Princeton, however, Willemain et al. (1994, p. 627) argue that
younger classes were indeed less generous.

4. Explaining satisfaction and giving
As noted above, the sociological literature on charitable giving suggests that people give to causes and
organizations that have meaning for them personally.12
It appears to be common for donors to have had at least
some direct experience with the donee organization, an
observation consistent with surveys: volunteers are more
likely to make contributions than non-volunteers, and
members of organizations are more likely to give than
non-members.13 In the case of alumni giving, the potential donors have unusually long and intensive experiences with the organizations, but these experiences are
often distant in time and place. A great advantage of the
College and Beyond survey is the information it contains
on both objective aspects of the college experience and
current subjective assessments of that experience. Satisfaction with one’s undergraduate experience is a mark
of approval that would be expected to induce feelings of
gratitude or a desire to enhance the institution’s chances
of future good influences. Because of this association,

12
Schervish and Havens (1997), for example, refer to the
“social networks of invitation and obligation.” They argue that
donors’ identification with organizations is more important than
generosity per se.
13
For the relationship between giving and volunteering, see,
for example, Hodgkinson and Weitzman (1996, p. 37). In 1996,
76% of those who were members of organizations made gifts
in 1995, compared to 37% among those who were not (p. 94).
Similarly, those who were active in religious organizations were
more likely to give (79 vs. 57% p. 88), and those who were
more active gave more on average (p. 93).

it seems especially appropriate to consider the factors
associated with that satisfaction.
Exactly how that expressed satisfaction might relate
to donative giving is a more complicated matter. While
it would be reasonable to believe that satisfaction influences the level of giving, it is not at all clear that satisfaction is exogenous to the donations decision. One possibility is that donations and satisfaction are jointly
determined; another is that expressed satisfaction itself
is a function of the level of donations. For this reason
equations explaining giving are estimated both with and
without measures of expressed satisfaction as explanatory variables. Since the equations explaining satisfaction
and giving share virtually the same list of regressors, the
model for giving without satisfaction can be viewed basically as a reduced-form equation.
Table 1 presents equations explaining the dichotomous
variable SATIS, indicating whether an individual is
“very satisfied” with his or her undergraduate experience. One set of equations includes a set of dummy variables to reflect institutional differences in satisfaction;
another replaces these with dummy variables to indicate
liberal arts colleges (COLLEGE) and selectivity (SEL-1
and SEL-2), the last two signifying the highest and next
highest levels of selectivity.14 Because of the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, logit is used for
estimation. For each of the four models, the table
presents estimated coefficients, standard errors, marginal
probabilities, and implied odds ratios for each explanatory variable.15 Coefficients in bold are significantly different from zero at the 99% level.16
Three factors have consistently significant and positive
coefficients: attending a college that was the person’s
first choice, having had someone who took an interest in
him or her during college (MENTOR), and being very
satisfied with life in general. Of these, MENTOR has the
strongest association: those who had such a person had
twice the odds of reporting they were very satisfied with
their college experience. Another factor that had one
highly significant coefficient in both cohorts was coming

14
See, for comparison, similar regressions explaining satisfaction for the 1976 cohort presented by Bowen and Bok (1998,
Table D.7.2).
15
The odds ratio, equal to eb, where b is the estimated coefficient, summarizes the effect of dichotomous explanatory variables by giving the ratio of the odds with as opposed to without
the condition underlying the dummy variable. The coefficient
0.56 for FIRST implies, for example, that the odds of being
satisfied are 75% higher for those for whom the institution was
their first choice than for whom it was not. The odds are p/(1p) where p is the probability of being very satisfied (SATIS=1).
16
The samples used in Tables 2 and 3 exclude all observations with missing data for NONWHITE, FEMALE, MARRIED, NUMKIDS, and GRAD. The samples in Table 1 also
exclude observations where SATIS is missing.

from a public high school. Like the similar equations
estimated by Bowen and Bok (1998) for the 1976 cohort,
eqs. (3) and (4) in Table 1 suggest that satisfaction was
strongly associated with high income, institutional selectivity, liberal arts colleges, and having earned professional degrees after college. Quite apart from any consideration of alumni giving, these results regarding
expressed satisfaction are interesting on their own and
certainly pertinent to undergraduate institutions.
Especially noteworthy is the significance of the MENTOR variable, which speaks to the importance that
alumni attach to personal contacts with faculty and other
college staff. Likewise, the greater satisfaction expressed
by alumni of liberal arts colleges may also indicate
appreciation of the richer opportunities for personal contact presumably available in the more intimate college
setting. However, the positive associations with income
and professional degrees are rather unexpected. One
possible explanation for the latter result may be that
nothing is better than rigorous professional training for
engendering an appreciation for the relative freedom of
the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. Satisfaction for
the 1976 cohort was also associated with having graduated from the institution in question and having received
some academic honor, but for neither cohort was participation in athletics or other extracurricular affairs statistically significant. Nor does state of residence or academic
major figure prominently in satisfaction.
Turning next to the question of alumni giving, one
observes behavior like that seen in other contexts: while
in any year many individuals make contributions, many
others contribute nothing. Econometrically, such
behavior is often represented by postulating a latent variable G∗ that is related to a set of regressors X in a linear
fashion such as G∗=Xb+e. For individuals for whom

117

G∗ⱕ0, observed contributions are zero. Where G∗⬎0,
the logarithm of giving is G∗. Although the use of ordinary least squares is inappropriate in such a case,
unbiased estimates can be obtained by applying a Tobit
maximum likelihood technique (Tobin, 1958). Table 2
presents selected coefficients from Tobit regressions
using as the dependent variable the logarithm of average
giving, over the period 1991–1995. The effect of each
regressor on the expected value of the logarithm of giving is calculated by multiplying the estimated coefficient
by the probability of making any donation (McDonald &
Moffitt, 1980). The set of explanatory variables is quite
similar to that used in the equations explaining satisfaction. It excludes aspects of the person’s college application (SAT score, high school class rank) judged to be
of no relevance to current donations and includes current
employment status and dummy variables signifying dissatisfaction with faculty research or undergraduate teaching (DISSATA) or with other contemporary features of
the institution (DISSATB). As in the case of the
regressions for overall satisfaction, equations were estimated with and without a full set of institutional dichotomous variables. They were also estimated with and
without explanatory variables for satisfaction. The coefficient for GRAD in eq. (1) of 1.74 implies that, holding
other things constant, those in the 1951 cohort who
graduated from the institution gave about three times as
much as those who did not. The corresponding coefficient in eq. (4) implies that the differential was even
greater for the 1976 cohort, almost four times as much.17
Eqs. (1) and (4) also imply strong income effects.
Between income classes 6 and 9, for example, the
amount contributed rises proportionally more than
income for the 1951 cohort, while for the 1976 cohort,
the implied income elasticity is closer to 0.8.18
The other important explanatory variables for the 1951
cohort implied by eq. (1) are overall satisfaction, participation in extracurricular activities and athletics, and having an M.B.A. For the 1976 cohort the other important
effects are having received a graduate degree from the
same institution, being nonwhite (negative), overall satisfaction, being married (negative), expressing dissatisfaction with aspects of the institution other than teaching
or research (negative), having been an athlete, having an
M.Ba., having received academic honors, and expressing
dissatisfaction with the institution’s emphasis on teach17
The derivative of the expected value of the log of giving
with respect to this dummy variable in eq. (1) is
(1.74(0.64)=1.11. Exp(1.11)=3.03. In eq. (4) it is
(2.74)(0.50)=1.37. Exp(1.37)=3.94.
18
Between the two classes, the ratio of midpoint incomes is
2.59. For the 1951 cohort the ratio of estimated giving in eq.
(1) is exp(0.64(3.91-2.21))=2.97. In eq. (4) it is
exp(0.50(3.28⫺1.60))=2.32. The latter implies an elasticity of
roughly 1.32/1.59=0.83.

<-----Page 9----->118

ing and research (negative). An alternative estimation
approach, in which the Tobit estimation was replaced
with a two-part model (the second part being an OLS
regression only on those who made donations), yielded
much the same qualitative results, suggesting that the
factors associated with being a donor are also those that
predict how much donors will give. This alternative
approach also makes clear that alumni with higher
incomes not only give more when they donate but are
also more likely to be donors in the first place.19
Eqs. (2) and (5) drop the institutional dummy variables. In their place is a dummy variable for liberal arts
colleges and, for 1976, two qualitative variables indicating different levels of selectivity as indicated by the average SAT scores of matriculants. For both cohorts, the
indicator for liberal arts colleges enters strongly and significantly. Other things equal, alumni in this sample who
attended liberal arts colleges gave about twice as much
as those who had been at private universities.20 The patterns of other estimated effects change little for the 1976
cohort, in eq. (5), but the patterns do change for the 1951
cohort, with participation in extracurricular activities and
athletics and M.Ba. losing significance at the 1% level.
In their place, three variables that become significant are
getting a graduate degree at the same institution, DISSATB, and having attended a public high school.
Eqs. (3) and (6) present the “reduced form” model, in
which all the satisfaction variables are dropped. A common effect between the two equations is that MENTOR,
whose effect had evidently been mediated through the
satisfaction variables, becomes more important in its
own right in explaining the level of giving, being significant at the 1% level for the 1951 cohort. For those
in that older cohort, having had such a person in college
is associated with increased giving on the order of 40%.
For the 1951 cohort, participation in extracurriculars and
athletics once again become significant, as does athletics
in the1976 cohort.
Because the necessary data were available for only
some of the institutions, variables for legacy status and
financial aid are not included in these regressions. But
other regressions were estimated for the smaller sample
of institutions that provided data on financial aid, most

19
The first part of this approach consisted of logit equations
on giving anything. Of the 13 variables with statistically significant Tobit coefficients in Table 2, eq. (1), 9 had statistically
significant coefficients of the same sign in both the logit and
OLS regressions. of the 18 variables with significant coefficients in eq. (3), 13 were also significant in both equations of
the two-part estimation. For a general comparison of Tobit with
two-part models, see Manning, Duan and Rogers (1987).
20
Derivatives of the expected value of the log of mean giving
with respect to the college dummy were (1.22)(0.64)=0.78 and
(1.46)(0.50)=0.73, implying multiplicative effects of 2.2 and
2.1, respectively.

of which also provided data on legacy status. These
regressions included dummy variables to indicate legacies and recipients of need-based financial aid. Both
coefficients are statistically insignificant for the 1951
cohort, but they are significant (at the 1% level) for the
1976 cohort.21 The equation for 1976 implies that those
who had once received need-based financial aid contributed about 23% less than other alumni. Whether this
coefficient reflects the lower wealth of previous aid
recipients is unclear, but it is consistent with fears
occasionally expressed about the depressing effects of
college loans, a form of finance commonly included in
the aid packages of financial aid recipients in the late
1970s.22 In contrast, legacies in the 1976 cohort gave
more than non-legacies, again an effect that might proxy
wealth differences.
In sum, the regression equations explaining alumni
giving clearly show the importance of two factors:
income and an overall good opinion of one’s alma mater.
As discussed in the previous section, this overall satisfaction was associated with a number of aspects of the
undergraduate experience, most notably the memory of
at least one person associated with the institution who
took an interest in the respondent. Other indicators of
strong association with the institution and satisfaction
with life in general were correlated with satisfaction as
well.

5. Giving over time
Because it contains information on donations over
time, the present data set offers the opportunity to investigate the time pattern of donations. One aspect of this
time pattern that has received attention in several recent
studies of charitable giving is the possibility that taxpayers time their gifts so as to increase the share of
deductions taken in years when their marginal tax rates
are the highest. Another temporal aspect of giving, which
has received little attention from tax analysts, is the
effect of movements in prices on the stock market.23

21
The coefficients and standard errors for the dummy variables indicating receipt of financial aid, legacy status, and missing information on legacy status were, respectively: 0.32(0.24),
0.24(0.27), and 0.49(1.53) for the 1951 cohort. They were
⫺0.38(0.15), 0.62(0.21), and ⫺0.14(0.40) for the 1976 cohort.
Given that 68.8% of the 1962 observations had positive average
giving, the implied derivatives are exp((⫺0.382)(0.688)) and
exp((0.622)(0.688)), respectively.
22
For a discussion of the rising importance of loan finance
in the 1970s, see Clotfelter, Ehrenberg, Getz and Siegfried
(1991, pp. 98–105).
23
However, one study of alumni giving (Bristol, 1991–92)
does examine the association between stock market performance and donations.

<-----Page 10----->C.T. Clotfelter / Economics of Education Review 22 (2003) 109–120

Increasing share values may not only have a generalized
wealth effect on giving, they also have a direct effect to
the extent that donors make contributions in the form of
appreciated stock. A third feature of the time pattern of
giving in the case of alumni donations is the effect of
organized class reunions. Previous studies have indicated
that alumni giving tends to increase during reunion years.
Although the College and Beyond data set includes
annual donations, it contains no information on other
personal information that may vary over time, thus making it impossible to use panel data techniques to estimate
the complete model of donations. In particular, information on income is available for only one year, meaning that a fixed-effects model, using the current data,
would thus necessarily leave out income altogether.
Despite the obvious disadvantage of omitting income
effects, such a limitation ironically has the advantage that
variation over time in the price of giving can thus arise
only from changes in the tax law, which mitigates the
identification problem as it relates to the price effect, a
problem that plagues the empirical charitable giving
literature.
Although the data limitations prevent the use of a fullfledged fixed effects model, there are other advantages in
estimating a limited model in first differences, the most
important being the “differencing out” of unobserved
personal characteristics that influence the level of giving.
The price of giving was calculated by applying an estimate of taxable income for each income class in each
year to the federal income tax rate schedules.24 Both giving and price are measured as logarithms. Stock prices
are reflected by the log of the S&P 500 average,
expressed in constant dollars. Finally, reunion years are
indicated by a dummy variable indicating every fifth year
following the person’s actual college graduation. In first
differences this dummy variable yields, for a person who
graduated in 1955, for example, a value of 1 for 1994–
95 and a value of ⫺1 for 1995–96. Because the

24
Taxable income corresponding to each income category in
each year was approximated by multiplying the midpoint for
the income class corresponding to 1995 income (or the average
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for the top class obtained from
tax return data) by the ratio of taxable income to AGI corresponding to that income level in 1995. These taxable income
figures were multiplied by the ratio of nominal per capita disposable income for each year before and after 1995 to obtain
estimates of taxable income by income class for all other years.
See Cruciano (1997, pp. 22, 30) and US Bureau of the Census
(1998, p. 317). These estimates were applied to tax rate schedules for single and joint returns. The resulting marginal tax rates
were used to calculate the price of giving, as one minus the
marginal tax rate, applying to each person’s 1995 income category and marital status. Since there was no information on
changes over time in either income or marital status, the trend in
price is largely a function of changes in the tax rate schedules.

donations data apply to fiscal years, the stock and price
variables, which correspond to calendar years, are effectively lagged six months.25
Table 3 presents the estimated equations. Their very
low R2’s indicate how little of the variation in giving
over time is explained by this simple model. Nevertheless, changes in stock prices are shown to be statistically
significant in explaining changes in giving, with implied
elasticities larger than 0.35. Changes in price are not significant, however. While this result may suggest that
alumni giving is not responsive to the tax-defined price
of giving, it seems more likely that the imprecision
implicit in calculating the marginal tax rate has biased
the coefficient toward zero. Finally, the reunion variable
is significant only for the older cohort, a finding that is
consistent with previous studies showing larger spikes
for later reunions than for earlier ones.26

6. Conclusion
Owing to the nature of the data it employs, this paper
illuminates a critical element in charitable giving that is
typically obscured in econometric studies of the subject:
the personal experiences that often link donors to the
organizations to which they donate. Although the data
contain less income detail than most economic analyses
of charitable giving, they offer unusually rich information describing each former student’s past association
with his or her undergraduate college. It also provides a
look at patterns of donations over time to a single organization, an aspect of giving behavior that has not previously been examined.
Strikingly, though perhaps not surprisingly, the
donations that alumni made to their alma maters were
highly correlated to their expressed satisfaction with
their own college experiences and other measures of satisfaction with the institution. Their satisfaction, in turn,
was systematically and consistently related to several
aspects of that experience, including whether the person
had attended a public high school, whether the college
had been the person’s first choice, and whether there was
someone who took a special interest when he or she was
enrolled there.
The level of alumni donations was strongly associated
with income and with whether or not the person graduated from the institution where he or she first attended

25
As noted in the text, data were available for varying numbers of years for 11 institutions for the 1951 cohort and all 14
institutions for the 1976 cohort. The resulting sample sizes for
the pooled regressions thus depend on the number of alumni
and the number of years of data for each included institution.

college. Those who graduated from liberal arts colleges
tended to give more than those who attended universities.
Among the more recent cohort of graduates, those who
had received need-based aid tended to give less and those
who were related to former alumni tended to give more.
Some of these findings may reflect the effect of otherwise unmeasured wealth. While it is surely not the most
important reason for institutions to examine their admissions policies, these findings do highlight the connection
between admissions and future donations and the possible long-term consequences of the increasingly meritocratic character of admissions at elite institutions.27 To
the extent that affluent students are replaced with highachieving ones, future prospects for alumni giving naturally will depend on the earning success of the latter vs
the lost advantages of inherited wealth. If it turns out
that such meritocratic tendencies do come at the expense
of future contributions, this unintended consequence will
be merely one more example of the maxim of the free
lunch.
