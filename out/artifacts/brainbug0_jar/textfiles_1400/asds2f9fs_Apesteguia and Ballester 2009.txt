Abstract. In the model of choice by sequential procedures, the successive application of
criteria gradually reduces the set of alternatives to a unique element, which is the one actually chosen. We offer a simple property, Independence of One Irrelevant Alternative, and
show it is equivalent to choice by sequential procedures. Our property is instrumental for
the understanding of choice by sequential procedures, and provides a novel tool with which
to study how other behavioral concepts relate to it. We show that the notions of rationalizability by game trees, agenda rationalizability, and choice functions exhibiting a status-quo
bias are special cases of choice by sequential procedures.

1. Introduction
In the model of choice by sequential procedures, a decision-maker (DM) faced with a choice
problem, applies a number of criteria in a fixed order of priority, gradually narrowing down
the set of alternatives until one is identified as the choice (see Manzini and Mariotti 2007;
see also Tversky 1972). The model of choice by sequential procedures is very appealing from
a behavioral perspective. It consists of a method that guides the DM through the complex
problem of choice. As such, it has attracted a great deal of attention from the psychology,
marketing, and management literatures.1
For the sake of illustration, imagine that our DM is about to buy a house. She may
handle the complexity of the choice problem by first screening out some houses on the basis
of location. Although the DM may not have formed a complete ranking over all possible
locations, she may prefer some locations over others, and use this criterion to eliminate some
houses. Next, the DM may care about the layout of the house, and have some idea of what
kinds of layout she dislikes. Hence, from the surviving set of houses, the DM eliminates a

further number of houses based on their layout. The DM proceeds in this way, applying
additional relevant criteria and gradually shrinking the menu of alternatives, before finally
making her choice from the surviving set of alternatives on the basis of price, for example.
This sequential process does not necessarily satisfy the standard axioms of choice, and
hence is able to accommodate decisions that are incompatible with the classical model of
rational choice. For example, let the set of houses be {x, y, z}. Suppose that, in terms of
location, the only clear comparison for our DM is that z is superior to y; that, in terms
of layout, she clearly prefers x to z; and finally that the cheapest house is y. If our DM
first applies the location criterion, and follows it with the layout criterion and finally the
price criterion, the choices we would observe are y from {x, y}, z from {y, z}, and x from
{x, z} and from {x, y, z}. The choices of our house buyer are cyclic, and hence cannot be the
outcome of the maximization of any preference relation.2 Therefore, although the choices are
perfectly compatible with choice by sequential procedures, they cannot be accommodated
within the model of rational choice.
An immediate question is whether all sorts of choice patterns can be accommodated by
the sequential application of criteria. A simple example shows that this is in fact not the
case. Suppose that we observe that our DM chooses house x from {x, y} and from {x, z},
but chooses house y from {x, y, z}. It is impossible to reconcile this behavior with choice
by sequential procedures. Whatever criterion the DM entertains first, it will lead to a
contradiction. That is, the first criterion cannot eliminate house x from {x, y, z}, because
this would imply eliminating x from {x, y} or {x, z}, which is the actual choice from these
menus. It obviously cannot eliminate house y from {x, y, z}. Therefore, the first criterion
must eliminate only house z from {x, y, z}. But then, the choices of house x from {x, y} and
of house y from {x, y, z}, which has been reduced to {x, y}, are incompatible.3
It is therefore the case that choice by sequential procedures is able to explain some deviations from the rational model, but not all. For choice by sequential procedures to be
a meaningful model of choice, it is necessary to understand what sorts of choice patterns
can be rationalized by the sequential application of criteria. Manzini and Mariotti (2007)
took some very important first steps in this direction by precisely delimiting the types of

2Classic

papers documenting systematic cyclic choice behavior include May (1954), Grether and Plott

(1979), and Loomes, Starmer and Sugden (1991).
3Kalai, Rubinstein, and Spiegler (2002) propose a model where the DM partitions the set of choice
problems into different categories and applies one criterion to each category. Clearly, every possible choice
pattern can be explained by their model.

<-----Page 2----->3

revealed choices that are consistent with the application of two or three criteria.4 However,
the general question was left unanswered.
The former wonders about what deviations from the rational model can be explained by
choice by sequential procedures. Another crucial question is how choice by sequential procedures relates to other prominent choice models. Given the growing number of alternative
choice models that are flourishing in the literature, it is of great importance to impose some
structure on the relevant models.
In this paper we offer a property, Independence of One Irrelevant Alternative (IOIA), that
addresses the two questions posed above. IOIA can be described as follows. First, from the
menu of alternatives A, the DM pinpoints a single pair, which she identifies by following
a rule that is totally consistent across menus of alternatives. There are several behavioral
interpretations of this rule. For example, the DM may be more used to comparing some
pairs of alternatives than others, and may therefore decide to focus on the most familiar
pair in every choice problem with which she is faced. Relatedly, pairs of alternatives may
differ in terms of the similarity of the alternatives. So, for any choice problem A, the DM
may focus on the pair with the most (or the least) similar alternatives. The DM may
also perceive the alternatives in a particular physical order and observe that order when
identifying the first two alternatives in a choice problem A. Then, having identified a single
pair of alternatives from the menu, IOIA requires that the choice from A should not depend
on the dominated member of that pair. Thus, IOIA has two parts. It is the result of the
interplay of a fully consistent component, the rule identifying the binary problems, and a
potentially inconsistent component, the choices in the binary problems.
IOIA delimits what kinds of deviation from the rational model can be explained by the
model of choice by sequential procedures. In our first result we show that IOIA is equivalent
to the notion of choice by sequential procedures, regardless of the number of rationales
required. IOIA provides a tool that is easy to use in applications to determine whether
observed behavior is or is not consistent with choice by sequential procedures. Moreover,
IOIA helps to explain which kinds of deviation from the rational model are compatible with
choice by sequential procedures. Interestingly, the fully consistent part of IOIA, that is,
the rule identifying the binary problems, is the mechanism through which irrational binary
choices spread over choice problems.
Furthermore, IOIA serves as an instrument to link choice by sequential procedures with
other prominent choice models in the literature. In particular, we show that the notion of
rationalizability by game trees, due to Xu and Zhou (2007), which, in principle, had little to
4Salant

and Rubinstein (2008) also delimit the case of two rationales, within the framework of a ‘limited

attention’ model.

<-----Page 3----->4

do with choice by sequential procedures, is a special case of the latter. We also show that
agenda rationalizability, a rationalizability notion that is introduced here and is rooted in
certain models of choice by ordered elimination, as well as in voting mechanisms based on
successive elimination, is also a strict refinement of choice by sequential procedures. Finally,
we show that choice functions exhibiting the well-known status-quo bias also are contained
in the model of choice by sequential procedures.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notation and the main definitions to be used thereafter. Section 3 presents our property IOIA and shows that it is
equivalent to choice by sequential procedures. Section 4 contains three applications of our
property IOIA. Section 5 concludes. The proofs are collected in Appendix A. Appendix B
establishes the formal relation between our model of choice by sequential procedures, and
other prominent models.

2. Basic Notation and Definitions
Let X be a finite set of n ≥ 2 objects. A choice function c assigns to every non-empty
A ⊆ X a unique element c(A) ∈ A.
Denote by B(X) the collection of 2-alternative sets (binary problems). A binary selector
f is a function that for every choice problem A with at least two alternatives, gives a binary
problem in A, i.e. f (A) ∈ B(X) with f (A) ⊆ A. Given a binary selector f , the direct
revealed relation S on B(X) is defined by (B1 , B2 ) ∈ S if and only if there is a choice
problem A such that B1 = f (A) and B2 ⊆ A. Denote the transitive closure of S by S. We
say that the binary selector f is consistent if and only if, for all A, and for all B1 , B2 ⊆ A,
B1 6= B2 , B1 SB2 implies that B2 6= f (A). The latter is simply the Strong Axiom over the
space of binary problems, where a choice problem A is understood as the collection of binary
problems from which it is composed.
Denote by P an acyclic binary relation on X. That is, for any collection x1 , . . . , xr ∈ X,
with r > 1, whenever (xi , xi+1 ) ∈ P for all i = 1, . . . , r − 1, it is not true that (xr , x1 ) ∈ P .
We will often refer to P as a rationale. For any A, M (A, P ) refers to the set of maximal
elements in A with respect to P , that is, M (A, P ) = {x ∈ A : (y, x) ∈ P for no y ∈ A}. Let
M (∅, P ) be equal to ∅.
In the classical approach a choice function c is said to be rationalizable if there is a rationale P such that, for any choice problem A, c(A) = M (A, P ). Let Mij (A) with i ≤ j denote
the set Mij (A) = M (M (. . . M (M (A, Pi ), Pi+1 ), . . . , Pj−1 ), Pj ). That is Mij (A) is the set of
alternatives surviving from A the sequential application of rationales Pi , Pi+1 , . . . , Pj−1 , Pj .

<-----Page 4----->5

Choice by Sequential Procedures: A choice function c is a choice by sequential procedures whenever there exists a non-empty ordered list {P1 , . . . , PK } of rationales on X such
that c(A) = M1K (A) for all A ⊆ X. In that case we say that {P1 , . . . , PK } sequentially
rationalizes c.
This notion of choice by sequential procedures largely follows Manzini and Mariotti (2007).
In their original formulation, the only structure that is imposed on the rationales applied by
the DM is asymmetry, hence allowing for cycles in the rationales. We believe that the essence
of choice by sequential procedures lies in the incompleteness of the criteria, which reflects the
crudeness of the binary relations sequentially applied by the DM in order to reach a choice.
The use of cyclic criteria may be controversial from a behavioral perspective, since they
may appear unrealistic. It seems natural, therefore, to study possibly cyclic choice behavior
arising from the sequential application of acyclic binary relations. This is the position we
adopt here. In Appendix B we clarify the relation between these two models of sequential
choice.5
3. Choice by Sequential Procedures and Independence of One Irrelevant
Alternative
The classic notion of rationalizability of a choice function c deals with whether or not
there exists a rationale that explains choice behavior as the result of maximization. A wellknown result establishes that a choice function c is rationalizable if and only if c satisfies
Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). IIA is a consistency property that forbids any
menu-dependency. It states that if an element x is chosen from a set A, it should also be
chosen from any subset of A in which x is present.
IIA can be equivalently described as follows. Suppose that, given a menu of alternatives
A, the DM pinpoints any binary problem in A, and discards the dominated alternative in
the binary problem. It is immediate that if the choices of the DM satisfy IIA, the choice
from A will be the same as the choice from A minus the dominated alternative. Moreover,
the reverse also applies. Hence, we can write IIA as follows:6
Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA): For any consistent binary selector f
and any A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }), with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)).
5See

Bossert, Sprumont and Suzumura (2005) and Ehlers and Sprumont (2008) for a thorough discussion

of models of rationalization by a single asymmetric or a single acyclic rationale.
6The

equivalence between the two statements of IIA is proved in the Appendix, in Lemma A.1.

<-----Page 5----->6

IIA imposes a great deal of structure on choice by forbidding menu dependencies for every
possible consistent way of identifying the binary problems. We offer a property, Independence of One Irrelevant Alternative (IOIA), which constitutes a strict weakening of IIA.
Independence of One Irrelevant Alternative (IOIA): There is a consistent binary selector f such that, for any A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }), with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)).
It is immediate that IOIA imposes less structure than IIA. IOIA only requires the DM
to be consistent when identifying binary problems in certain ways. For example, the DM
must be consistent when focusing on, say, the most salient binary problem for her. Saliency
may be determined by the DM’s familiarity with the alternatives, or in terms of a particular
physical order of presentation of the alternatives, etc. Therefore, contrary to IIA, IOIA
allows for menu dependencies when identifying binary problems in other ways.
We show next that IOIA is equivalent to the notion of choice by sequential procedures,
regardless of the number of rationales required.
Theorem 3.1. c is a choice by sequential procedures if and only if c satisfies IOIA.
The proof of Theorem 3.1 shows that, to assess whether c is a choice by sequential procedures, one simply has to check whether there is a linear order over the binary sets such that,
for every choice problem A and for the first binary problem B ⊆ A, the choice from A does
not depend on the dominated alternative in B. This makes the IOIA property particularly
manageable in applications, and easy to use in practice.
IOIA also helps us to understand how deviations from rationality emerge in the model of
choice by sequential procedures. The sequential procedure has two dimensions. The first is
that it addresses the complexity of the choice problem by gradually shrinking the menu of
alternatives in sequential steps. The second has to do with the nature of the alternatives that
are eliminated in each step. Therefore, deviations from the rational model may emerge from
the first dimension, from the second, or from a combination of both. Manzini and Mariotti
(2007) show that if behavior in the binary problems is fully consistent so is behavior in larger
menus, and vice-versa. The property of No Binary Cycles captures the notion of consistent
behavior in the binary problems:
No Binary Cycles: For all x1 , . . . , xr+1 ∈ X, c(xj , xj+1 ) = xj , j = 1, . . . , r, implies that
c(x1 , xr+1 ) = x1 .
Now, it is easy to reproduce their result by way of our property IOIA.

<-----Page 6----->7

Lemma 3.2. c satisfies IOIA and No Binary Cycles if and only if c satisfies IIA.
IOIA can be understood as the interplay of a fully consistent component, the binary
selector f , and a potentially irrational component, choices from binary problems. Now,
IOIA together with Lemma 3.2, shows not only that the type of irrational behavior that
can be accommodated by choice by sequential procedures starts from cycles in the binary
problems, but also that the totally consistent binary selector f is the mechanism through
which the irrationality over the binary problems spreads over larger menus of alternatives.
Interestingly, if the starting point is that a DM behaves according to choice by sequential
procedures, the above lemma shows that to asses whether the DM is rational one only needs
to evaluate whether his binary choices are consistent.

4. Applications
4.1. Rationalizability by Game Trees. We begin this section by establishing the relation between choice by sequential procedures and a rationalizability notion due to Xu and
Zhou (2007): rationalizability by game trees. Xu and Zhou study those choice functions that
can be rationalized by extensive games with perfect information. More specifically, we say
that (G; R = (R1 , . . . , RK )) denotes a game tree whenever: (i) G is an extensive game with
perfect information that has alternatives X as terminal nodes, such that each alternative in
X appears once and only once as a terminal node of G (hence, X and G can be identified),
and (ii) every node i in the tree G represents the possible choices of an agent i endowed with
a linear order Ri over X. Denote by G|A the reduced tree of G that retains all the branches
of G leading to terminal nodes in A, and SP N E(Γ) stands for the subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium outcome of Γ.
Rationalizability by Game Trees: A choice function c is rationalizable by game trees
whenever there exists a game tree (G; R) such that c(A) = SP N E(G|A; R) for all A ⊆ X.
The relationship between rationalizability by game trees and choice by sequential procedures is not clear-cut a priori. On the one hand, the game tree structure of the preferences
in the former is much richer than the linear structure of the rationales in the latter. On the
other hand, the preferences of the players in rationalizability by game trees are imposed to
be linear orders, whereas in choice by sequential procedures the rationales are only imposed
to be acyclic. The following result establishes a perhaps unexpected relationship between
the two notions.

<-----Page 7----->8

Theorem 4.1. If c is rationalizable by game trees, c is a choice by sequential procedures.
The converse is not necessarily true.
4.2. Agenda Rationalizability. Let us assume that the n elements in X are linearly ordered by <. This order may be interpreted as, say, a particular physical presentation of
the objects. For any choice problem A in X, write the l elements in A ordered by < as
a(1) < a(2) < · · · < a(l). Consider a tournament T .7 The DM chooses from A according
to the following elimination process. First she chooses between a(1) and a(2) using T , then
compares the chosen element from a(1), a(2) with a(3) and makes a new choice according to
T . The DM continues in this ordered manner until the surviving element is compared with
the last element a(l); this last choice determines the final choice in A. Denote by e(<, T, A)
the alternative chosen from A by this process, given the agenda <, and the tournament T .
Similar choice-by-ordered-elimination procedures are studied in the choice-theory literature. The models studied in Rubinstein and Salant (2006) and Salant and Rubinstein (2008),
for example, include this one as a special case. See also Masatlioglu and Nakajima (2008).
But binary choices between alternatives may also be the outcome of majority voting, for
example. Therefore voting mechanisms such as those based on successive elimination are
also connected to the above (see Dutta, Jackson, and Le Breton, 2002). Consider now the
following notion of rationalizability.
Agenda Rationalizability: A choice function c is agenda rationalizable whenever there
exists a linear order < over the set of alternatives (an agenda) and a tournament T such
that, for every A ⊆ X, c(A) = e(<, T, A).
Theorem 4.2 establishes the relation between agenda rationalizability and choice by sequential procedures.
Theorem 4.2. If c is agenda rationalizable, c is a choice by sequential procedures. The
converse is not necessarily true.
4.3. Status-Quo Bias. There is a large literature supporting the view that DMs typically
value an alternative more highly when it is regarded as the status quo, than they would
otherwise. This is the so-called status-quo bias. Masatlioglu and Ok (2005) provide a
theoretical treatment of choice behavior that allows for the presence of a status-quo bias.8

points in general, and for references to the empirical and theoretical literature on the status-quo bias in
particular.

<-----Page 8----->9

In Masatlioglu and Ok’s setting, a choice problem is a pair (A, x) where A is the set of
alternatives, and x ∈ A or x = . When x ∈ A, the pair (A, x) represents a choice problem
with a status quo, while if x = , the choice problem is standard in the sense that it is
without a status quo. Thus, choice is defined over the collection of all choice problems (A, x).
Masatlioglu and Ok introduce a set of properties for choice behavior that are equivalent to
the following status-quo biased choice model. The DM evaluates the alternatives by means
of a vector-valued utility function u, in a multi-criteria style. If the DM confronts a choice
problem without a status quo, then she simply maximizes an aggregation h of these criteria.
If there is a status quo, then the DM compares the status quo with all the alternatives in
the set using all the criteria. She will stay with the status quo unless there is an alternative
that dominates it in terms of all the decision criteria. This represents a marked status-quo
bias. If there are alternatives that dominate the status quo by all the criteria, then the DM
chooses from them using the same aggregator h as above.
The following definition is a reformulation of Masatlioglu and Ok’s Theorem 1 to our setting.
Status-Quo Biased Choice Function: A choice function c is status-quo biased if there
exists an element x ∈ X, a positive integer q, an injective function u : X → Rq and a strictly
increasing map h : u(X) → R such that:
(1) For all A ⊆ X with x 6∈ A, c(A) = arg max h(u(x)).
x∈A

(2) For all A ⊆ X with x ∈ A:

c(A) =


 x


if A ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} = ∅,
arg max

h(u(y))

if A ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} =
6 ∅.

y∈A∩{x∈X:u(x)>u(x)}

Theorem 4.3 shows that status-quo biased choice functions are choice by sequential procedures.9
Theorem 4.3. If c is a status-quo biased choice function, c is a choice by sequential procedures. The converse is not necessarily true.
9It

can be proved that the set of status quo biased choice functions is contained in the set of agenda

rationalizable choice function, and that the latter is at the same time contained in the set of choice functions
that are rationalizable by game trees. In order to illustrate the applicability of our property, IOIA, we have
chosen to offer direct links between choice by sequential procedures and these notions of choice.

5. Final Remarks
In this paper we have studied the behavioral structure of choice by sequential procedures
and its relationship with other choice models. We have proposed a simple relaxation of
the classical IIA property, IOIA, and shown that it is equivalent to the notion of choice
by sequential procedures, regardless of the number of rationales required. Further, we have
shown that our property does not only allow a better understanding of choice by sequential
procedures, but it is useful in the sense that it facilitates investigation of the relationships
between different models of choice. We have shown that the notions of rationalizability by
game trees, agenda rationalizability, and choice functions exhibiting a status-quo bias are
special cases of the model of choice by sequential procedures.
We believe it is crucial to the future development of the field to investigate the links
between the relevant models of choice. Manzini and Mariotti (2009) take a further step in
this direction. In line with our property IOIA and our Theorem B.1, they show that choice
by sequential procedures is equivalent to the model of choice by lexicographic semiorders
(see Tversky, 1969). Interestingly, Manzini and Mariotti (2009) build on our paper to offer
an alternative property that is also equivalent to choice by sequential procedures.
Our property IOIA suggests promising new lines for future research. Specifically, it would
be natural to investigate the nature of the process by which binary problems are identified in
certain environments, that is, to determine the essence of the rule f that makes one binary
problem stand out from any others. Relatedly, it might be particularly interesting to study
the role of marketing strategies or that of a principal in shaping the f of a consumer in a
market interaction environment.
Appendix A. Proofs
Lemma A.1. The following two statements are equivalent:
(1) For any A, B ⊆ X, if c(B) ∈ A ⊆ B then c(A) = c(B).
(2) For any consistent binary selector f and any A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }), with
x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)).
Proof of Lemma A.1: (1) ⇒ (2). Consider a consistent binary selector f and a set A ⊆ X.
We first claim that c(A) 6= x∗ , with x∗ = f (A)\c(f (A)). If c(A) 6∈ f (A), it is straightforward
that c(A) 6= x∗ . If c(A) ∈ f (A) ⊆ A then, by (1), it must be c(A) = c(f (A)) and thus,
c(A) 6= x∗ as desired. Now, since c(A) ∈ A\{x∗ } ⊆ A, (1) guarantees that c(A) = c(A\{x∗ }).
(2) ⇒ (1). Let A, B ⊆ X, such that c(B) ∈ A ⊆ B. If B = A the result is obvious.
Denote c(B) = x1 , the elements in B \ A as x2 , x3 , . . . , xk , with k > 1, and finally the rest
of elements in X as xk+1 , . . . , xn . Let the binary selector f select, for any D ⊆ X with

<-----Page 10----->11

|D| ≥ 2, the first two elements in D according to the previous ordering. It is immediate
that f is consistent. Then, by (2) we know that x1 = c(B) = c(B \ {x∗ }), and hence
it can only be x∗ = x2 and c(B) = c(B \ {x2 }). Iterating this argument it follows that
c(B) = c(B \ {x2 , x3 , . . . , xk }) = c(A), as desired. 
Proof of Theorem 3.1: We start by proving that IOIA is a sufficient condition for choice
by sequential procedures. IOIA implies that there is a consistent binary selector f such that,
for every A ⊆ X, c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }), with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)). Since f satisfies the Strong
Axiom, the transitive revealed relation S over B(X) is also antisymmetric. Suppose not.
That is, there are binary sets B1 , B2 , W1 , . . . , Wr such that B1 SB2 and B2 SW1 S · · · SWr SB1 .
By definition B1 SWr , and by the Strong Axiom it cannot be that Wr SB1 , a contradiction.
Now, it is well-known that the asymmetric part of a transitive and antisymmetric binary
relation can be extended to a linear order. Denote by C the linear order over B(X) extended
from S. Consequently, for every A with |A| ≥ 2, f (A) is the first binary problem contained
in A according to C. Denote, then, the ordered collection of binary problems with two
n(n−1)/2

alternatives according to C by {ai , bi }i=1

. Without loss of generality, let it be assumed
n(n−1)/2

that ai = c(ai , bi ), i = 1, . . . , n(n − 1)/2. Define Pi = {(ai , bi )}. Clearly, {Pi }i=1

is a

collection of rationales.
n(n−1)/2

We prove, by induction over the cardinality of choice problems A ⊆ X, that {Pi }i=1

sequentially rationalizes c. It is obvious for the case of |A| ≤ 2. Supposing that the claim
is true for |A| = t, we show it to be true for |A| = t + 1. By IOIA, c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }),
n(n−1)/2

with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)). By the inductive hypothesis c(A \ {x∗ }) = M1

n(n−1)/2

and by the definition of x∗ and the construction of the rationales, M1
n(n−1)/2

M1

n(n−1)/2

(A). Therefore, c(A) = M1

(A \ {x∗ }),

(A \ {x∗ }) =

(A), as desired.

In the other direction, we now show that if c is a choice by sequential procedures, then
IOIA holds. Let {P1 , . . . , PK } sequentially rationalize c. First, construct the collection of
rationales {P10 , . . . , PK0 } from {P1 , . . . , PK }, as follows: for all j = 1, . . . , K, (x, y) ∈ Pj0 if
and only if (x, y) ∈ Pj and there is no i < j such that (x, y) ∈ Pi or (y, x) ∈ Pi . Clearly,
{P10 , . . . , PK0 } is an ordered collection of rationales that sequentially rationalizes c. Assume,
without loss of generality, that the constructed collection {P10 , . . . , PK0 } is composed of nonempty rationales (otherwise, simply remove the empty rationales and re-number them).
Now, consider a rationale Pj0 in the constructed collection of rationales {P10 , . . . , PK0 },
that contains more than one pair of alternatives. Since Pj0 is acyclic, there is a pair of
alternatives (a, b) in Pj0 , such that (b, c) 6∈ Pj0 for every c ∈ X. We can split the rationale Pj0 into two rationales, {(a, b)} and Pj0 \ {(a, b)}. We show that for every A ⊆ X,
M (A, Pj0 ) = M (M (A, {(a, b)}), Pj0 \ {(a, b)}). If either a or b is not in A, then clearly

<-----Page 11----->12

M (A, Pj0 ) = M (A, Pj0 \ {(a, b)}), and since M (A, {(a, b)}) = A, it follows that M (A, Pj0 \
{(a, b)}) = M (M (A, {(a, b)}), Pj0 \ {(a, b)}). Thus, M (A, Pj0 ) = M (M (A, {(a, b)}), Pj0 \
{(a, b)}).

If, on the contrary, a, b ∈ A, then M (A, {(a, b)}) = A \ {b}.

Given that

(a, b) in Pj0 and that (b, c) 6∈ Pj0 for every c ∈ X, M (A, Pj0 ) = M (A \ {b}, Pj0 ). Hence,
M (A, Pj0 ) = M (M (A, {(a, b)}), Pj0 \ {(a, b)}), as desired. It then follows that the ordered
0
0
collection of rationales {P10 , . . . , Pj−1
, {(a, b)}, Pj0 \ {(a, b)}, Pj+1
, . . . , PK0 } also sequentially

rationalizes c. By iterating this rationale-splitting process, we end up with a collection of ra∗
tionales {P1∗ , . . . , Pn(n−1)/2
}, each of which contains one pair of alternatives and sequentially

rationalizes c.
Construct the binary selector f as follows. For every A with |A| ≥ 2, f (A) = {a, b} if
and only if {(a, b)} = Pl∗ and there is no {d, e} ⊆ A with {(d, e)} = Pm∗ and 1 ≤ m < l ≤
∗
}
n(n−1)/2. It is immediate that f satisfies the Strong Axiom. Given that {P1∗ , . . . , Pn(n−1)/2

sequentially rationalize c and given the construction of f , it follows that c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }),
with x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)), and hence IOIA holds.
Proof of Lemma 3.2: The if part is immediate, so let us show the only if part. It is obvious
for the case of |A| ≤ 2. Supposing that the claim is true for |A| = t, we show it to be true for
|A| = t+1. By IOIA there is a consistent binary selector f such that c(A) = c(A\{x∗ }), with
x∗ = f (A) \ c(f (A)). By the inductive hypothesis c(A \ {x∗ }) = M (A \ {x∗ }, P ), where P is
a linear order. By definition x∗ 6= c(f (A)), by the inductive hypothesis c(f (A)) = M (f (A)),
and given that P is a linear order, it must then be that M (A \ {x∗ }, P ) = M (A, P ), and we
are done.
Proof of Theorem 4.1: Let c be a choice function rationalizable by game trees. We will
prove that c satisfies IOIA and is therefore a choice by sequential procedures. Consider a
game tree (G; R = (R1 , . . . , RK )) that rationalizes c. Suppose, without loss of generality,
that players are indexed by a linear order < such that i < j if i is a successor of j in
the game tree G. We say that i is resolute on {x, y}, if Ri determines the outcome over
0
{x, y}. That is, whenever SP N E(G|{x, y}; R) = SP N E(G|{x, y}; (R−i
, Ri )) for any vector
0
of linear orders of players other than i, R−i
. Define the minimal resolute player in A ∈ P(X)

by m(A) = min{i ∈ {1, . . . , K} : i is resolute over a pair {x, y} contained in A}.
Consider the following linear order C on B(X). Let {a, b}, {d, e} ∈ B(X), with a = c(a, b)
and d = c(d, e),
(
{a, b} C {d, e} ⇔

m({a, b}) < m({d, e}), or
m({a, b}) = m({d, e}), (b, e) ∈ Rm({a,b}) .

<-----Page 12----->13

We now show that IOIA holds with respect to the constructed linear order C. By rationalizability of game trees, c(A) = SP N E(G|A; R), and also c(A \ {x∗ }) = SP N E(G|(A \
{x∗ }); R), where x∗ is the dominated alternative in the first binary problem in A according to C. We show that SP N E(G|A; R) = SP N E(G|(A \ {x∗ }); R). By definition of
subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, SP N E(G|A; R) = SP N E(G|(A \ {z}); R), where z is
every dominated alternative in A according to the minimal resolute player in A. Clearly, by
construction, x∗ satisfies these conditions, and hence the claim follows.
We now show by way of an example that the inclusion is strict. Let X = {1, . . . , 4}
and c be such that: Ac [1] = {(1, 3, 4), (1, 3)}, Ac [2] = {(1, 2, 4), (1, 2), (2, 4)}, Ac [3] =
{(1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)} and Ac [4] = {(1, 4)}, where A ∈ Ac [x] ⇒ c(A) = x.
It can be easily checked that IOIA follows with respect to the following linear order C over
B(X): (2, 4) C (2, 1) C (3, 4) C (3, 2) C (1, 3) C (4, 1), and then by Theorem 3.1 c is a choice by
sequential procedures. To see that c is not rationalizable by game trees, we show that c does
not satisfy the divergence consistency property, which Xu and Zhou prove to be a necessary
condition for rationalizability by game trees.10 Note that in c, 1 diverges before 3 and 4, and
3 diverges before 1 and 2. At the same time, we have that c(1, 3) = 1 but c(2, 4) = 2, which
contradicts divergence consistency. Therefore, c is not rationalizable by game trees and the
theorem follows.
Proof of Theorem 4.2: Suppose that c is agenda rationalizable by the agenda < and the
tournament T . Define the binary selector f by f (A) = {a(1), a(2)} for every A with |A| ≥ 2.
Clearly, f satisfies the Strong Axiom. By construction, and by agenda rationalizability
x∗ = a(1) if (a(2), a(1)) ∈ T and x∗ = a(2) if (a(1), a(2)) ∈ T . Hence, it follows that
c(A) = e(<, T, A) = e(<, T, A \ {x∗ }) = c(A \ {x∗ }). Then, IOIA holds, and by Theorem 3.1
c is a choice by sequential procedures.
Consider now the choice function c defined in the proof of Theorem 4.1. We showed that c
is a choice by sequential procedures. To show that c is not agenda rationalizable, note that,
since 1 diverges before 3 and 4, any agenda < that rationalizes c should be of the form 3 < 1
and 4 < 1. Furthermore, since 3 diverges before 1 and 2, the agenda should also be of the
form 1 < 3 and 2 < 3. But this is obviously absurd, and therefore, there is no agenda that
rationalizes c.

10For

any triple x, y, z, x diverges before y and z, if c(x, y) = x, c(y, z) = y, and c(z, x) = z, and

c(x, y, z) = x. Divergence consistency: for any four alternatives x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , if x1 diverges before y1 and
y2 , and y1 diverges before x1 and x2 , then c(x1 , y1 ) = x1 if and only if c(x2 , y2 ) = y2 .

Proof of Theorem 4.3: Take a status-quo biased choice function c. Define the following two
classes of binary problems: B1 (X) = {{x, y} ∈ B(X) : it is not true that u(y) > u(x)} and
B2 (X) = B(X) \ B1 (X). Take any linear order C on B(X) such that for every {a, b} ∈ B1 (X)
and {c, d} ∈ B2 (X), {a, b} C {c, d}.
Take any A with |A| ≥ 2 and let x∗ denote the dominated alternative in the first binary
problem in A according to C. In showing that c satisfies IOIA, we distinguish between four
cases.
Case 1: x ∈ A and {x, y} ∈ B1 (X) for every y ∈ A. Given that A ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) >
u(x)} = (A \ {x∗ }) ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} = ∅, then c(A) = c(A \ {x∗ }) = x.
Case 2: x ∈ A and {x, y} ∈ B2 (X) for every y ∈ A. Since A ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} =
A \ {x} =
6 ∅, then c(A) = arg max h(u(y)). The latter being c(A \ {x}).
y∈A\{x}

Case 3: x ∈ A and there are two alternatives y, z ∈ A such that {x, y} ∈ B1 (X)
and {x, z} ∈ B2 (X). By construction, x∗ 6= x, and f (A) = {x, x∗ } ∈ B1 (X). Then
A ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} = (A \ {x∗ }) ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} =
6 ∅, then c(A) =
arg max
y∈A∩{x∈X:u(x)>u(x)}

h(u(y)) =

arg max

h(u(y)) = c(A \ {x∗ }).

y∈(A\{x∗ })∩{x∈X:u(x)>u(x)}

Case 4: x 6∈ A then, obviously c(A) = c(A \ {y}) for every y 6= c(A).
To show that the inclusion is strict, consider the example in Theorem 4.1. If x ∈ {2, 4},
there is a pairwise cycle in X \{x} which contradicts (1) in the definition of status quo biased
choice functions. If x ∈ {1, 3}, then 3 = c(1, 2, 3) 6∈ {1, 2, 3} ∩ {x ∈ X : u(x) > u(x)} 6= ∅,
thus contradicting (2) in the mentioned definition.

Appendix B. Different Models of Choice by Sequential Procedures
While in this paper we take the rationales to be acyclic, Manzini and Mariotti (2007)
impose only asymmetry, and hence allow for cycles in the rationales. The models share the
same intuition in that they consider a DM who gradually narrows down the set of alternatives
by applying a set of crude criteria in a fixed order. They nevertheless differ in terms of the
structure imposed on the rationales. In this section we clarify the relation between these
and other models of sequential choice. We first need some definitions.
We say that a binary relation P is asymmetric if, for any x, y ∈ X, whenever (x, y) ∈ P ,
it is not true that (y, x) ∈ P . We say that P is transitive if, for any x, y, z ∈ X, whenever
(x, y), (y, z) ∈ P , then (x, z) ∈ P . We say that P is simple whenever P is a singleton set
containing a pair of different elements of X, i.e., P = {(x, y)} with x, y ∈ X, x 6= y. We say
that P is α whenever the structure of α lies between the structure of a simple rationale and an
acyclic one. Examples of α rationales are (strict) partial orders (transitive and asymmetric)

<-----Page 14----->15

or semiorders (a special case of a transitive and asymmetric binary relation; see Manzini and
Mariotti, 2009).
We can now define the notion of choice by sequential procedures on the basis of the
structure imposed on the criteria sequentially applied. To this end, take the definition of
choice by sequential procedures of section 2 and say that c is a choice by sequential procedures
by asymmetric rationales CSP(As), or by acyclic rationales CSP(Ac), or by simple rationales
CSP(S), or by α rationales CSP(α) when the ordered collection of rationales is made up of
asymmetric rationales, acyclic rationales, simple rationales, and α rationales respectively.
Denote by C ω , with ω ∈ {CSP(As),CSP(Ac),CSP(S),CSP(α)}, the class of choice functions
that are CSP(As), CSP(Ac), CSP(S), and CSP(α). Finally, denote by C RSM the set of
choice functions that are Rational Shortlist Methods, that is, that are choice by sequential
procedures by two asymmetric rationales (Manzini and Mariotti, 2007).
Theorem B.1 shows that it is in fact the case that SR(Ac) and SR(As) are two different
notions of sequential choice, and that any model of choice that imposes structure that lies
between SR(S) and SR(Ac) is equivalent to SR(S) and SR(Ac).
Theorem B.1. C RSM ⊂ C CSP (S) = C CSP (α) = C CSP (Ac) ⊂ C CSP (As) .
Proof of Theorem B.1: We start by proving that C RSM ⊆ C CSP (Ac) . Suppose c is an RSM.
Then, there exists a pair of asymmetric rationales {P1 , P2 } that sequentially rationalizes
c. We now construct a collection of acyclic rationales {P10 , . . . , PK0 } that also sequentially
rationalizes c. Let P10 = P1 and given P2 = {(a12 , b12 ), . . . , (ar2 , br2 )}, define the following simple
0
= {(aj2 , bj2 )}, 1 ≤ j ≤ r. First, we prove that all rationales are acyclic.
rationales Pj+1

. Suppose, by way of contradiction,
This is immediate for the simple rationales P20 , . . . , Pr+1

that P10 = P1 is cyclic. Then, there exists a collection x1 , . . . , xr ∈ X, with r > 1, such
that (xi , xi+1 ) ∈ P1 , i = 1, . . . , r − 1, and (xr , x1 ) ∈ P1 . Then M ({x1 , . . . , xr }, P1 ) = ∅,
contradicting the fact that {P1 , P2 } sequentially rationalizes c. Therefore, all rationales are
acyclic.
0
Second, we show that the collection {P10 , . . . , Pr+1
} sequentially rationalizes c. Take any A.

Suppose that M1r+1 (A) contains two or more distinct elements. Take any two such elements
x, y ∈ M1r+1 (A), x 6= y. Then, for j = 1, . . . , r + 1, it is neither the case that (x, y) ∈ Pj0 nor
that (y, x) ∈ Pj0 . But then, for i = 1, 2 it is neither true that (x, y) ∈ Pi nor that (y, x) ∈ Pi .
This contradicts the fact that {P1 , P2 } rationalizes the choice in {x, y} and therefore M1r+1 (A)
contains at most one element. We now prove that c(A) belongs to M1r+1 (A). Given that c
is sequentially rationalized by {P1 , P2 }, it follows that c(A) ∈ M (A, P1 ) = M (A, P10 ) and,
for any y ∈ M (A, P10 ), it cannot be the case that (y, c(A)) ∈ P2 . Therefore, there is no Pj0 ,
j = 2, . . . , r+1, such that (y, c(A)) ∈ Pj0 , and then c(A) ∈ M1r+1 (A). Hence, c(A) = M1r+1 (A)

<-----Page 15----->16

} is a collection of acyclic binary relations that rationalizes c. Therefore,
and {P10 , . . . , Pr+1

it follows that C RSM ⊆ C CSP (Ac) .
We now show that the inclusion is strict, i.e., C CSP (Ac) 6⊆ C RSM . To do so, we define a
choice function c1 that is in C CSP (Ac) , but is not an RSM.
Let X = {1, . . . , 4} and c1 be such that: Ac1 [1] = {(1, 3)}, Ac1 [2] = {(1, 2)}, Ac1 [3] =
{(1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)}, and Ac1 [4] = {(1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4)}. Consider the ordered collection of simple rationales {P1 , . . . , P6 } = {{(2, 1)}, {(1, 3)}, {(4, 1)},
{(3, 2)}, {(4, 2)}, {(3, 4)}}. It is easy to check that this collection sequentially rationalizes
c. Note, however, that 4 = c1 (1, 2, 4) = c1 (1, 3, 4) but c1 (1, 2, 3, 4) = 3. This means that
c1 violates the classic Expansion property, and then by Theorem 1 in Manzini and Mariotti
(2007), c is not an RSM.11 Therefore, C RSM ⊂ C CSP (Ac) .
We now show that C CSP (S) = C CSP (Ac) . That C CSP (Ac) ⊇ C CSP (S) is immediate, and
C CSP (Ac) ⊆ C CSP (S) follows from the rationale-splitting argument used in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Now, given that C CSP (S) = C CSP (Ac) , since an α rationale lies, in terms of structure,
between a simple and an acyclic rationale, it follows immediately that C CSP (S) = C CSP (α) =
C CSP (Ac) .
Lastly, we show that C CSP (Ac) ⊂ C CSP (As) . The fact that C CSP (Ac) ⊆ C CSP (As) is obvious,
so we now prove that the inclusion is strict. Consider the following example.
Let X = {1, . . . , 6} and c2 be such that: Ac2 [1] = {(1, 3, 4, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (1, 3),
(1, 5)}, Ac2 [2] = {(2, 3, 6), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6)}, Ac2 [3] = {(2, 3, 4, 5, 6), (2, 3, 4, 5), (2, 3, 5, 6),
(3, 4, 5, 6), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 6), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}, Ac2 [4] = {(2, 4, 5, 6), (1, 4, 6),
(2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (1, 4), (2, 4), (4, 6)}, Ac2 [5] = {(1, 3, 4, 5, 6), (1, 3, 5, 6), (1, 4, 5, 6), (1, 5, 6),
(4, 5, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)}, Ac2 [6] = {(1, 3, 4, 6), (2, 3, 4, 6), (1, 3, 6), (3, 4, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6)}, and c2 (A) =
c2 (A \ {2}) whenever {1, 2} ⊆ A.
We first show that c ∈ C CSP (As) . Consider for instance P1 = {(1, 2)}, P2 = {(1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2),
(2, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1)}, P3 = {(5, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (6, 3), (3, 5), (4, 6)} and P4 = {(4, 1), (3, 2)}.
One can verify that all choices are sequentially rationalized by this ordered collection of
asymmetric rationales.
Suppose that c2 is sequentially rationalized by the ordered collection of simple rationales
{P1 , . . . , PK } with Pi = {(ai , bi )}, i = 1, . . . , K. Let T be the smallest positive integer
such that PT 6= {(1, 2)} and PT 6= {(2, 1)}. T is well-defined since the collection of simple
rationales must rationalize the choice in set {1, 3}, for instance.
We now show that for every A with {aT , bT } ⊆ A and {1, 2} 6⊆ A, it must be that c2 (A) =
c2 (A \ {bT }). If T = 1, it is immediate that c2 (A) = M1K (A) = M1K (A \ {b1 }) = c2 (A \ {b1 }).
11Expansion:

For all A, B ⊆ X, x = c(A) = c(B) ⇒ x = c(A ∪ B).

<-----Page 16----->17

If T > 1, ∪i<T {ai , bi } = {1, 2}, and then it follows that c2 (A) = M1K (A) = MTK (A) =
MTK (A \ {bT }) = M1K (A \ {bT }) = c2 (A \ {bT }). Consider now the following cases:
• c2 ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 5 6= 6 = c2 ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6} \ {5}) implies (aT , bT ) 6∈ {(1, 5), (3, 5)}.
• c2 ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 5 6= 3 = c2 ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6} \ {1}) implies (aT , bT ) 6∈ {(4, 1), (6, 1)}.
• c2 ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 5 6= 1 = c2 ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6} \ {6}) implies (aT , bT ) 6∈ {(4, 6), (5, 6)}.
• c2 ({1, 3, 4, 6}) = 6 6= 4 = c2 ({1, 3, 4, 6} \ {3}) implies (aT , bT ) 6∈ {(1, 3), (6, 3)}.
• c2 ({2, 3, 4, 6}) = 6 6= 3 = c2 ({2, 3, 4, 6} \ {6}) implies (aT , bT ) 6= {(2, 6)}.
• c2 ({2, 3, 4, 6}) = 6 6= 2 = c2 ({2, 3, 4, 6} \ {4}) implies (aT , bT ) 6= (3, 4).
• c2 ({2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) = 3 6= 6 = c2 ({2, 3, 4, 5, 6} \ {5}) implies (aT , bT ) 6= (2, 5).
• c2 ({2, 3, 6}) = 2 6= 6 = c2 ({2, 3, 6} \ {2}) implies (aT , bT ) 6= (3, 2).
• c2 ({2, 4, 5}) = 4 6= 5 = c2 ({2, 4, 5} \ {2}) implies (aT , bT ) 6= (4, 2).
• c2 ({2, 4, 5}) = 4 6= 2 = c2 ({2, 4, 5} \ {4} implies (aT , bT ) 6= (5, 4).
Thus, (aT , bT ) 6∈ {(1, 2), (1, 5), (3, 5), (4, 1), (6, 1), (4, 6), (5, 6), (1, 3), (6, 3), (2, 6), (3, 4),
(2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 4)}. Given the binary choices in c2 , (aT , bT ) is then a pair such that
bT = c({aT , bT }). However, M1K ({aT , bT }) = MTK ({aT , bT }) = aT leading to a contradiction
with the fact that the simple rationales sequentially rationalize c2 . Therefore, no collection
of simple rationales can sequentially rationalize c2 . Since c2 6∈ C CSP (S) implies c2 6∈ C CSP (Ac) ,
it follows that c2 ∈ C CSP (As) \ C CSP (Ac) , which concludes the proof of the theorem.
Having shown that CSP(As) differs from CSP(Ac), it is not difficult to prove that a
property along the lines of IOIA is equivalent to CSP(As). The only modification one needs
to make is to allow f to pinpoint from any choice problem A more than one binary problem.
That is, to define f as a correspondence.
