Abstract
With increasing globalization and the proliferation of communication technologies, more
people are working in cross-functional, geographically distributed teams. Although trust is
clearly an important ingredient in these collaborations, little is known about the challenges
this new work and social environment creates for the development of trust. Diﬀerent disciplinary perspectives, diﬀerent regional or national cultures, and the lack of face-to-face interaction when working at a distance raise signiﬁcant barriers to developing trust between
distant co-workers. We, therefore, posit that traditional models of trust need to be adapted
to describe the development of trust between cross-functional, geographically distributed
partners. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a longitudinal study of architecture, engineering and construction management students engaged in designing and planning a $5 million construction project in distributed teams. Our results suggest that cross-functional,
geographically distributed workers may rely on early impressions of perceived trustworthiness when evaluating how their distant partners are delivering on commitments, because
reliable information about actual follow-through is lacking or diﬃcult to interpret. Consistent with this, we found that perceived trustworthiness, perceived follow-through and trust
were relatively stable over time. We conclude that initial perceptions of trustworthiness are
particularly important in cross-functional, geographically distributed work, although
research is needed to draw comparisons with traditional work environments.

1. Introduction
Imagine a construction ﬁrm with oﬃces worldwide that has won a competition to
build a prestigious hotel facility in Singapore worth over $100 million. They assign
a world famous architect based in their London oﬃce to team up with a senior
structural engineer from their design group in the San Francisco oﬃce, and they
engage a general contractor based in Singapore to construct the hotel.
Such scenarios are commonplace today in the construction industry and are
becoming increasingly common in other industries. Cross-functional, geographically distributed workers provide great advantages by bringing to bear the diverse
skills of scarce specialists on problems or projects that span traditional organizational boundaries, in such diverse areas as software development (Carmel, 1999),
engineering (Hauptman & Hirji, 1999; Levinthal & Warglien, 1999), nursing (Ireson & McGillis, 1998), purchasing, and new product development (Brunelli, 1999).
Although companies are rapidly adopting cross-functional, geographically distributed work (Jasswalla & Sashittal, 1999), little is known about the challenging
new social and work environments that these organizational forms create for team
members (Maznevski & Chudoba, 2000).
One of the major challenges for workers in cross-functional, geographically distributed work is the development of trust (e.g., Bishop, 1999). Trust is central to
teamwork, leadership, and organizational culture (Fairholm, 1994; Nicholas, 1993;
Ryan, 1999). Trust may be particularly important in cross-functional projects
because many sub-tasks are interdependent, with team members relying on the
functional expertise of their team members. The process of developing trust in
cross-functional, geographically distributed work environments, however, may be
hindered by the characteristics that deﬁne this context (e.g., O’Hara-Devereaux &
Johansen, 1994). By deﬁnition, cross-functional workers belong to diﬀerent disciplines and therefore have diﬀerent educational backgrounds, diﬀerent professional loyalties and often conﬂicting goals. Trust may be more diﬃcult to
establish in cross-functional work because workers are less familiar with the goals,
world-views, problem solving approaches, and methods of members from other
disciplines (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). When geographically distributed, workers
often ﬁnd it more diﬃcult to share information, to observe others’ work, and to
develop rapport. Geographic distance brings with it diﬀerences in regional and
national cultures, time zones, and work contexts, all of which may challenge the
development of shared interpretations. These characteristics of cross-functional,
geographically distributed work may render inadequate traditional models of trust
for predicting the development of trust on these teams.
In this paper, we establish analytically that the antecedents of trust may be different in cross-functional, geographically distributed work than in more traditional
uni-functional, collocated settings. We then empirically investigate a longitudinal

model of interpersonal trust that reﬂects the unique context of cross-functional,
geographically distributed work. Our research setting is a project-based environment in which teams of architecture, structural engineering and construction management students design, analyze, and plan a $5 million university building over a
period of four months.
1.1. Trust
Consistent with Rousseau and colleagues (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998: p. 395; see also Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), we deﬁne trust as ‘‘a
psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another, irrespective of the ability
to monitor or control that other party.’’ Along with others, we also assume that
trust can only exist within a particular situation or action (see Gambetta, 1988;
Bhattacharya, Divenney, & Pittultia, 1998). As Bigley and Pearce (1998) have
argued, it is not a question of ‘‘What is trust?’’ but rather ‘‘What trust and when?’’
Thus, we assume that the expectations of the intentions or behavior of another
must be embedded in a particular context.
1.2. Cross-functional work
A cross-functional team is a group of people with complementary skills who are
chosen to achieve a common goal and are mutually accountable for the team’s success (Katzenback & Smith, 1993). Cross-functional teams are popular for changeorientated projects such as introducing ‘‘total quality’’ practices, business process
re-engineering and improvements to a product or to service quality (Bishop, 1999).
For example, each line of Harley-Davidson motorcycle is created by a team consisting of a program manager from the design community, a manufacturing lead, a
purchasing lead, and a marketing lead who work together to bring the product to
market (Brunelli, 1999). Such mutual accountability coupled with specialization
suggests high levels of interdependence. For example, in design/build projects, the
architect, engineer and construction manager are reciprocally interdependent—the
design and planning activities are performed more-or-less concurrently (Thompson,
1967). This structure potentially shortens the length of time spent in planning and
creates opportunities for joint problem solving, presumably resulting in buildings
that are more attractive, safer, cheaper and completed sooner. Such strong interdependence requires trust (Sheppard & Sherman, 1998; Shapiro, 1987), particularly in
cross-functional work, because other workers do not have the necessary skills to
perform in the breach created by non-performing workers. Sometimes, as is the
case with structural engineering, cross-functional workers cannot legally substitute
for one another.
Developing trust may be particularly diﬃcult in cross-functional work environments due to unshared and sometimes conﬂicting goals and perceived diﬀerences in
professional allegiance. Even though cross-functional workers collaborate to
achieve shared project goals, people from diﬀerent disciplines often have diﬀerent
functional objectives, priorities, and agendas (Jasswalla & Sashittal, 1999). For

<-----Page 3----->4

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

example, in a large construction project, the architect is responsible for the aesthetics of the building, the structural engineer for its structural soundness, and the construction manager for ensuring that it can be built on time and within budget.
These functional goals often are in conﬂict and require a ‘‘give and take’’ type of
problem solving to arrive at a solution that will satisfy the project goals as well as
the goals of each discipline.
Cross-disciplinary composition of the work environment also means that workers are less likely to perceive themselves as belonging to the same group or category, which is one of the factors that promotes trust (Brewer, 1996). Kramer,
Brewer and Hanna (1996) propose that the strength and salience of identiﬁcation
with a group inﬂuences trust of other members. Social categorization (Tajfel, 1969)
can lead to in-group bias resulting in higher perceived trustworthiness and enhance
perceived similarity that may reduce perceived risk. In cross-functional work, disciplinary diﬀerences may be particularly salient because of the importance people
place on their own specialization (e.g. Schunn, Cowley, & Okada, 1998). Each
discipline is in eﬀect a diﬀerent culture, created by the values and mores of the profession and reinforced by its education and practice. Thus, although task interdependence requires more trust between workers, the multi-disciplinary nature of this
work may make the development of trust more diﬃcult.
1.3. Geographically distributed work
The challenges confronting cross-functional workers are compounded when
workers are distributed around the globe. Trust can become increasingly diﬃcult to
develop when workers have few opportunities to interact face-to-face, rely heavily
on technology to mediate their interactions, and face cultural and language barriers. Geographic distribution reduces the amount of time that workers spend in
the presence of one another and therefore is likely to hinder the development of
rapport and trust (see Kiesler & Cummings, 2002). Physical proximity and faceto-face interaction may be crucial for developing and maintaining trust (see Nohria &
Eccles, 1992). Collocation also can reinforce social similarity and highlight obligations that individuals have to one another (Latane, Liu, Nowak, & Bonevento,
1995). When team members are geographically distant and rely on mediating
technologies to interact, information may ﬂow less easily between workers (see
Hollingshead, 1996), distributed workers may not develop the same understanding
of the information that is shared (e.g., Cramton, 2001), and workers may assume
the worst of distant team members (Cramton, 2002). For these reasons, when
observing geographically distributed teams, Armstrong and Cole (2002) noted that
distant team members had a more diﬃcult time reconciling issues.
In addition to spanning geographic distances, distributed teams are likely to be
composed of people from diﬀerent cultures with diﬀerent basic assumptions
(Schein, 1991). The diversity of distributed workers could make the development of
trust diﬃcult (Williams and O’Reilly, 1998) because others’ perspectives and behaviors are more easily misinterpreted (see Olson & Olson, 2000). Thus, we expect

<-----Page 4----->R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

5

that geographically distributed workers will have diﬃculty reconciling issues that
arise and developing and maintaining trust.
In an examination of trust development in distributed teams, Jarvenpaa and
Leidner (1999) concluded that distributed workers developed ‘‘swift trust’’—trust
based on the role occupied by the person, even when the person is initally
unknown (Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996)—but that it may have been fragile
and temporary. In their temporary (6-week duration) teams, few teams were able
to develop trust if trust was not established from the beginning. In summary, Jarvenpaa and Leidner argue that trust can be established in distributed teams, but it
may be fragile and early interactions between team members are crucial.
1.4. Trust development in cross-functional, geographically distributed work
We modiﬁed the Mayer, Davis and Schoorman (1995) model of organizational
trust to reﬂect the context of cross-functional, geographically distributed work. In
their integrative model of organizational trust, Mayer and his colleagues argue that
trust is a function of the trustor’s propensity to trust and the trustor’s perception
of the trustworthiness of the trustee. They further argue that the trustor’s perception of risk will aﬀect the extent to which the trustor is willing to be vulnerable to
the behaviors of the trustee. Finally, they propose that the outcomes of risk-taking
will aﬀect the trustor’s perception of the trustworthiness of the trustee in the
future.
Our model of interpersonal trust also relies on the trustor’s propensity to trust
and the trustor’s perception of risk (see Fig. 1). We, however, have added several
components to the model to represent the antecedents to trust in cross-functional,
geographically distributed work. First, in addition to considering their own risk,
we argue that trustors take into account the potential rewards of trusting the trustee. These rewards can be greater when diﬀerent disciplines are working together
because the project goals cannot be achieved without the participation of all necessary disciplines. Second, we propose that cultural diversity, which is common in
geographically distributed work, will reduce perceived trustworthiness. Third, we
propose that, because perceived follow-through is diﬃcult to assess in crossfunctional, geographically distributed work, initial perceptions of trustworthiness

Fig. 1. The proposed model of interpersonal trust in cross-functional global work.

<-----Page 5----->6

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

are used to evaluate work follow-through. The Mayer et al.model (1995) proposes
that outcomes inﬂuence perceived trustworthiness. We argue, however, that assessing performance or follow-through is diﬃcult when people do not share the same
disciplinary expertise and when, due to distance, they are unable to observe the
work being conducted. We therefore modify the Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
model to reﬂect the limitations of cross-functional, geographically distributed
work. Our model of interpersonal trust in cross-functional, geographically distributed work is pictured in Fig. 1 and described in detail below.
Disposition-based trust theories propose that trust develops based on a person’s
nature as a trusting or non-trusting person (Rotter, 1971). The trustor’s propensity
to trust (also referred to as general trust and dispositional trust) is a characteristic
of the trustor, independent of the situation or characteristics of the trustee.
Consistent with others, we also posit that the situation faced by the trustor
contributes to his or her willingness to trust. We extend the Mayer, Davis and
Schoorman model (1995), which includes risk but does not explicitly include
reward. Many scholars have argued that risk is a necessary pre-condition for trust
(Coleman, 1990; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt & Camerer, 1998). Several have considered
risk so central to the trust decision that they have incorporated the concept of risk
into their deﬁnition of trust (e.g., Shapiro, 1987; Sheppard & Sherman, 1998). For
example, Coleman (1990: 91) deﬁned trust as ‘‘an incorporation of risk into the
decision of whether or not to engage in the action.’’ The value at risk for the trustor equates to the value of what will be lost if the trusted person does not followthrough, which could include loss of overall project quality, time, cost of resources
invested, or reputation of the trustor if the failure interferes with the trustor’s
ability to meet obligations. Perceived risk may be mitigated by social controls, such
as binding contracts, procedural norms, and so forth (Shapiro, 1987) or exacerbated by uncertainty and lack of information. Risk may be perceived as particularly high in cross-functional, geographically distributed work because of high
task interdependence, the inability of workers to perform the job of others, and the
diﬃculty of getting information about team members’ follow-through. As proposed
in the Mayer et al.model (1995), we expect that the relationship between perceived
trustworthiness and trust will be moderated by risk in cross-functional, distributed
work. The trustor may think the trustee trustworthy, but if the risks are too high,
higher perceived trustworthiness may be required for trust (see below).
H1. The relationship between perceived trustworthiness and trust will be moderated
by the trustor’s perceived risk.
1.5. Reward
In addition to risk, we propose that the potential for reward is an important
situational consideration for the trustor in cross-functional work. There must be
some expected beneﬁt to be gained to justify accepting the risk of relying on the
other party (Hosmer, 1995). Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994: p. 129) discuss ‘‘a
perception of the incentive that leads the interaction partner to act cooperatively.’’

<-----Page 6----->R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

7

If the task is highly valued and no one else can perform it, as often happens in
cross-functional work, the trustor’s reward from trusting is likely to be large and
the trustor will be more likely to trust. We therefore believe that the relationship
between perceived trustworthiness and trust is moderated by reward. The trustor
may perceive the trustee as untrustworthy, but if the potential reward is high
enough, then the trustor will trust anyway (see below).
H2. The relationship between perceived trustworthiness and trust will be moderated
by the trustor’s perceived reward.
1.6. Perceived trustworthiness
Although the word trust is sometimes used when describing perceived trustworthiness (Hardin, 2000), it is important to distinguish between perceptions of
trustworthiness and trust because trust may be inﬂuenced by factors other than the
perceived trustworthiness of the trustee, such as risk and reward. Perceived trustworthiness is a multifaceted construct (Barber, 1983; Mishra, 1996; Rempel,
Holmes, & Zanna, 1985). Consistent with the Mayer et al. (1995) model, we use
three dimensions of perceived trustworthiness: benevolence, ability, and integrity.
Benevolence, as described by Mayer and colleagues (Mayer et al. 1995: 719), is
‘‘the perception of a positive orientation of the trustee toward the trustor.’’ Benevolence can be the outcome of goal alignment or ‘‘encapsulated interest’’ (Hardin,
2000) or the conﬁdence derived from mutually compatible interests (Das & Teng,
1998). Benevolence is similar to McAllister’s (1995) conception of aﬀect-based
trust—trust grounded in reciprocated concern for the other party. Ability is the
perception that the trustee has the skills and resources needed to perform the task
(e.g. Butler, 1991; Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). No matter how
diligent a worker, if he or she does not have the ability to accomplish the goal, the
likelihood of success is small and trust is not warranted. Ability is similar to
McAllister’s (1995) conceptualization of peer reliability and dependability, which
depend on the trustee’s ability to deliver as promised (or expected). Consistent with
Mayer and colleagues (Mayer et al., 1995), we have conceptualized ability as speciﬁc to the task and situation rather than as generalized expertise. The third dimension, integrity, refers to the honesty and moral character of the trustee as perceived
by the trustor. This is consistent with Mayer et al., (1995: 719) deﬁnition of
integrity as ‘‘the trustor’s perception that the trustee adheres to a set of principles
that the trustor ﬁnds acceptable’’ and with Butler’s (1991) dimension by the same
name. Trustees perceived as having integrity are seen as more likely to behave in
honorable ways and not deceive co-workers about their intention to followthrough on commitments and expectations. Thus, when trustors see co-workers as
high in integrity, they are more likely to perceive them as trustworthy. We posit
that these three factors are integral dimensions of perceived trustworthiness (Mayer
et al., 1995).

<-----Page 7----->8

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

1.7. Cultural diversity
Geographic distribution increases the likelihood that the members of working
dyads will be culturally diverse. Just as similarities are proposed to increase trust
(Brewer, 1996), cultural diversity is likely to reduce it. As evidence, Luo (2002)
found a negative correlation between interpersonal trust and cultural distance in
his study of international strategic alliances. He reported that cultural diﬀerences
impeded the development of trust, although once trust was built, it was equally
predictive of performance in culturally diverse and culturally homogeneous alliances. We propose that cultural diﬀerences create varying expectations and reduce
predictability, resulting in lower perceived trustworthiness, which will then lead to
lower trust (see below).
H3. When there is cultural diversity between the trustor and the trustee, the trustor
will perceive the trustee as less trustworthy than when the trustee belongs to the same
culture.
1.8. Perceived follow-through
Our dimension of perceived follow-through is similar to the dimension Mayer
et al. (1995) refer to as ‘‘outcomes.’’ It is also similar to the ‘‘outcomes’’ variable in
Bhattacharya, Devinney, and Pittultia’s (1998) dynamic model that describes trust
in terms of actions, outcomes and consequences. In both of these models, the variable ‘‘outcomes’’ refers to the positive or negative results of trusting. In our model,
perceived follow-through is more speciﬁc than outcomes. Perceived follow-through
is the extent to which the trustor perceives that the trustee has met expectations.
We argue that in cross-functional work, assessment of follow-through will be difﬁcult due to the lack of information and lack of expertise required to evaluate the
performance of a person from another discipline. Further, we anticipate that geographic distance will exacerbate the diﬃculty in assessing follow-through because
information transfer is more challenging and shared understanding is more diﬃcult
to develop among geographically distributed workers (Cramton, 2001; Hinds &
Weisband, 2003). More biased information exchange and diﬃculties in transmitting
information (Hollingshead, 1996; also Hinds & Bailey, in press) can reduce the performance information available and lead to inconsistent and erroneous interpretations (Cramton, 2001). In the absence of reliable performance information, trusters
may evaluate responsiveness rather than performance (Maister, 1993). Even the
evaluation of responsiveness, however, is subject to confusing circumstances in geographically distributed work, such as unintentional delays as a result of time zone
diﬀerences and technology failures (see Cramton, 2001). Therefore, we propose
that the trustor will use the limited information they have about the trustee—that
formed through initial impressions—to evaluate the trustee’s follow-through,
rather than assessing follow-through based on the actual work performed (see
below).

<-----Page 8----->R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

H4. In cross-functional, geographically distributed work, perceived follow-through
will mediate the relationship between perceived trustworthiness and trust of a trustee.
1.9. Forces for stability
Although there is evidence that trust changes over time, individuals rarely seek
disconﬁrming information and may actually try to avoid it (Good, 2000) suggesting that trust, like ﬁrst impressions (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989), may be
resistant to change over time (see Ring and van de Ven, 1994). In cross-functional,
geographically distributed work, disconﬁrming information may be even less available and less visible (see Cramton, 2002). Thus, workers in geographically distributed work environments may be more resistant to changing their opinions of
co-workers (see below).
H5. Trustor’s initial perceptions of trustworthiness, follow-through, and trust of their
co-workers will predict later perceived trustworthiness, follow-through, and trust in
cross-functional, distributed dyads.

2. Method
To evaluate the development of interpersonal trust among cross-functional, global workers, we studied geographically distributed student building design teams
composed of an architect, a structural engineer, and a construction manager. The
study we report here is the culmination of a three year project. In the ﬁrst and
second years, we conducted pilot studies to better understand the context and to
develop and reﬁne our quantitative measures.
2.1. The architecture/engineering/construction project
The participants for this study were students in a Computer Integrated Architecture-Engineering-Construction (A/E/C) class organized by the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Stanford University (Fruchter, 1999). Masters
students drawn from United States, European, and Asian universities and from
three diﬀerent disciplines—architecture (A), engineering (E), and construction management (C)—worked in geographically distributed teams for four months to
design a ﬁve-million-dollar building according to a client’s speciﬁcations. On average, students had taken 12 courses in architecture, structural engineering, or construction and had 8 months of full-time work experience in the domain. These
graduate students were assisted by undergraduate ‘‘apprentices’’ and mentored by
globally distributed professionals working in each discipline.
During an initial face-to-face meeting attended by all participants, students were
randomly assigned to teams. To facilitate assignment to groups, students were randomly given an experience proﬁle (e.g., experience working in an earthquake zone).
Each project had a speciﬁc characteristic, such as being located in an earthquake
zone. In an icebreaking exercise, students identiﬁed and joined the project that best

<-----Page 9----->10

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

suited their randomly assigned experience proﬁle (e.g., those with experience working in earthquake zones were likely to join projects with a building to be located in
an earthquake zone). By design, each team required at least one team member
from each discipline—architecture, engineering, and construction management.
Each team included at least one member who was not collocated. After the twoday project launch, the geographically distributed team members did not meet
again in a collocated face-to-face setting until the ﬁnal presentation four months
later. Distributed team members communicated mainly through computer-based
Internet applications. Internet meeting applications allowed audio and video communication and desktop ﬁle sharing. Internet message applications allowed
synchronous message transfer between two or more parties. An Internet computermediated collaboration tool developed for the course facilitated the posting and
retrieval of messages and ﬁles. Collocated team members used face-to-face meetings as needed.
2.2. Data collection
We conducted online surveys of 108 dyads formed into 12 teams composed of
three to four team members, distributed among 10 locations in six countries—the
United States, Switzerland, Holland, Germany, Slovenia, and Japan. All team
members participated in the research. A survey during the ﬁrst week of the project
asked questions about the number of courses taken in each discipline, work experience in each discipline and students’ perceptions of their own risks and rewards
associated with the project. Approximately one month later and three months
later, we distributed surveys, which yielded 108 dyadic responses (person A’s perceptions of person B) at each time. All students also were interviewed using a
structured protocol designed to cover the same topics as the survey.

3. Measures
3.1. Dependent Variable
Our primary dependent variable of interest is trust. We conceptualize trust as a
property of the relationship between two actors that has a directional quality and
an object of trust, as in A trusts B about X (Hardin, 2000). The need for questions
that identiﬁed a speciﬁc person and the performance of a speciﬁc task made most
existing trust scales unsuitable. In addition, it was necessary to diﬀerentiate our
measure of trust from perceived trustworthiness and its dimensions of benevolence,
ability, or integrity. For example, the question: ‘‘To what extent do you think that
Person B is competent?’’ is a better measure of perceived trustworthiness than of
trust. Our deﬁnition of trust is the willingness to accept vulnerability based upon
the expectation that another will perform, irrespective of the ability to monitor or
control that other party. Since one of the indicators of low trust is a higher level of
checking or monitoring of work progress (e.g., Strickland, 1958), we used checking
as a behavioral measure of trust. We measured the extent to which the trustor

<-----Page 10----->R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

11

reported checking on or verifying the work of the trustee, or feeling the need or
desire to do so. To create a measure of trust, we averaged across four items in the
dyadic survey (see Fig. 2), which were rated on a 5-point scale with high amounts
of checking rated more highly. We then reversed the scale, resulting in a variable
ranging from 1 to 5 with high scores indicating higher levels of trust. The scale
loads on one factor and reliability for the four items were acceptable (alpha = 0.77
for month 1 and 0.67 for month 3). These data were taken from the dyadic surveys
administered at months one and three in the project.
3.2. Independent variables
The primary independent variables of interest in this study are the trustor’s
propensity to trust, perceived risk and reward, cultural diversity, perceived trustworthiness, and perceived follow-through.
Propensity to trust was measured using the Rotter scale for general trust (Rotter,
1971) modiﬁed by Yamagishi, Cook and Watabe (1998). In the year prior to the
study reported here, we conducted a pilot study of 68 dyads formed into seven

Fig. 2. Scale items.

<-----Page 11----->12

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

teams to test the scales. Propensity resulted in low scale reliability (alpha = 0.47)
and the 12 items loaded on three factors. In the absence of a reliable measure, we
dropped propensity from the study.
Risk was measured on the survey by asking respondents ‘‘how much is at stake
for you (what do you have to lose) if one team member does not do their job?’’
Answers were reported on a 5-point Likert scale (see Fig. 2).
Reward was elicited using two questions (see Fig. 2). The ﬁrst question brought
forth the respondent’s perceived goals for the project; the second question asked
how important those goals were. The answers from the second question were
reported on a 5-point Likert scale and used as our measure of reward.
Cultural diversity. We used the participant’s country of origin to calculate
whether the team members of each dyad were of the same or diﬀerent culture.
We created a dummy variable for cultural diversity, coding 1 where the dyad
partners belonged to diﬀerent cultures and 0 where they were from the same
culture.
Perceived trustworthiness was measured based on the dimensions of perceived
benevolence, ability, and integrity reported by the trustor about the trustee in the
dyadic surveys. All items are listed in Fig. 2 and were measured using a 5-point
scale with 5 equal to higher levels of benevolence, ability, or integrity. Benevolence
was the extent to which the trustee demonstrated sensitive and helpful behaviors
that showed concern for the trustee. Ability was the extent to which the trustee
exhibited technical, professional, and project level competence. Consistent with
Mayer et al. (1995), we operationalized integrity as virtuosity and honesty as perceived by the trustor. This conceptualization was consistent with two questions
from McCroskey’s (1966) scales about source credibility, which we therefore adopted. Unfortunately, our measure for integrity was excluded from the survey for
month 1, so we only have this measure at month 3. To test the inﬂuence of integrity as a dimension of perceived trustworthiness, we created a measure for perceived trustworthiness at month 3, not including integrity, and ran all statistical
analyses. The pattern of results was the same. For month 3, we also conducted a
factor analysis and conﬁrmed that the items loaded on three factors as expected.
For month 1 and month 3, we conﬁrmed that the scale for perceived trustworthiness was reliable as a single scale (alpha = 0.84 and 0.84, respectively). Consistent
with our theory, we then averaged across all items to create scales for perceived
trustworthiness.
Perceived follow-through was measured based on the trustor’s evaluation of the
extent to which a co-worker followed through on commitments and completed
work on schedule (see Fig. 2). Perceived follow-through was measured at one and
three months into the project. The four items were measured on a 5-point scale,
where 5 equated to high levels of perceived follow-through. The scale had a
reliability of 0.89 (month 1) and 0.88 (month 3), so the four items were averaged to
create our measures of perceived follow-through.

4. Results
4.1. Analysis
We tested our hypotheses using linear regression models with ordinary least
squares estimation (OLS). We anticipated a problem with autocorrelation—the
correlation between values of the same variable across diﬀerent cases. Autocorrelation would occur if the trust of person A was related to the trust of person B. Theories of trust based upon reciprocity (Creed and Miles, 1996: 19) suggest that the
level of trust between two people is positively related (e.g. the more A trusts B, the
higher is B’s trust of A), which could cause a problem with ﬁrst order autocorrelation of the data between dyads. The Durbin-Watson (Hamilton, 1992) test statistic
(d) for correlation between the value of checking of the trustor and the trustee
were higher than the upper limit (d = 2.14) suggesting no positive ﬁrst-order autocorrelation among the errors. Thus, the reciprocal nature of trust does not appear
to be signiﬁcant in our data.
We also used the estimation procedure of AMOS (Hoyle, 1995; Byrne, 2001) to
construct a structural equation model (SEM). Doing so allowed us to observe
more complex relationships between variables and changes over time. The AMOS
SEM is a test of goodness of ﬁt between the data and the proposed model. Therefore, a low p-value indicates that the null hypotheses, that the model does not ﬁt,
can be accepted. A high p-value indicates that the null hypotheses can be rejected
and that the model does ﬁt. We adopted a conﬁrmatory analysis approach
(Joreskog, 1993). To maintain the same variables as used in our multivariate
regression models, we choose not to construct latent variables because isolating the
measurement error in the indicator variables (Hoyle, 1995) was not our goal and
could alter the values of the latent variables at the two points in time. Two potential problems with our data, a small sample size and non-normal distributions of
variables, tended to overestimate the v2 statistic and hence could lead to the rejection of suitable models (Byrne, 2001). We therefore used bootstrapping to provide
a greater degree of accuracy in assessment of model ﬁt statistics (Byrne, 2001).
4.2. Hypotheses tests
The descriptive statistics and correlations of the variables are shown in Table 1.
The majority of the dyads were culturally diverse (84%, see Table 1). Variables
measured at two points in time, such as trust, perceived trustworthiness and
perceived follow-through, had a higher standard deviation at month 1 than at
month 3. For example, the standard deviation of Trust (1) is .87, while the
standard deviation of Trust (3) was only 0.70. We noticed a positive relationship
between the trustor’s perceived rewards in the project and the perceived followthrough of the trustee at month 1 (r = 0.23, p < 0.05). We also noticed a negative
relationship between the trustor’s perceived risk and the perceived follow-through
of the trustee at month 3 (r = 0.29, p < 0.01). This could indicate that the
higher the rewards for the trustor, the more likely the trustor will be to interpret

the trustee’s follow-through in a positive light early in the project, but that risk
becomes more salient later in the project.
We hypothesized that the relationship between perceived trustworthiness and
trust will be moderated by the trustor’s perceived risk (H1). To test hypotheses 1
we conducted multivariate regression models predicting trust (see Table 2) with
terms representing the interaction between risk and perceived trustworthiness. To
create the interaction we hypothesized (low risk and perceived trustworthiness), we
reversed risk to create low risk and multiplied by perceived trustworthiness.
Although the interaction was not signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst models, when perceived follow-through was added to the model, it achieved signiﬁcance at month 1 (b = 1.12,
p < 0.05, see Table 2, model E1), providing partial support for hypothesis 1.
We also hypothesized that the relationship between perceived trustworthiness
and trust will be moderated by the trustor’s perceived reward (H2). We created a
variable to represent the interaction between reward and perceived trustworthiness.
The interaction variable was signiﬁcant in model C at month 1 (b = 1.23, p < 0.05),
but not at month 3 (b = 0.69, n.s.). When perceived follow-through was added
to the model, the eﬀect was no longer signiﬁcant, providing mixed support for
hypotheses 2 (see Table 2).
Hypothesis 3 states that trustors in culturally diverse dyads will have lower perceived trustworthiness for the trustee. As expected, cultural diversity was signiﬁcant
in predicting perceived trustworthiness at month 1 (T = .029, r < 0.01) and month
3 (r = 0.32, p < 0.001) (see Table 1). We also observed that cultural diversity was
signiﬁcant in predicting trust in month 3 (b = 1.23, p < 0.05, see model A3) until
perceived trustworthiness was added to the models (see Table 2, model B3). This
suggests that perceived trustworthiness may mediate the relationship between cultural diversity and trust.
Hypothesis 4 proposes that perceived follow-through will mediate the relationship between perceived trustworthiness and trust in cross-functional, geographically distributed work. We found strong correlations between perceived followthrough and trust and also between perceived trustworthiness and trust at both
month 1 and month 3. Because both perceived trustworthiness and perceived follow-through predict trust, the variable that maintains signiﬁcance when both are
added to a model predicting trust is the variable that directly inﬂuences trust
(Baron & Kenney, 1986). In regression models B1 and B2 (see Table 2), perceived
trustworthiness predicts trust at month 1 (b = 0.28, p < 0.01) and month 3 (b =
0.61, p < 0.001). When perceived follow-through is added in models D1 and D3,
perceived trustworthiness is not signiﬁcant at month 1 (b = 0.02, n.s.) and less
signiﬁcant at month 3 (b = 0.24, p < 0.05), suggesting full mediation early in the
project and partial mediation later. In contrast, perceived follow-through maintained signiﬁcance at both month 1 (b = 0.52, p < 0.001) and month 3 (b = 0.48,
p < 0.001). Overall, these analyses provide strong support for hypothesis 4.

4.3. Longitudinal model
In our last hypothesis (H5), we predicted that trustor’s initial perceptions of coworkers’ trustworthiness, follow-through, and trust would predict later perceived
trustworthiness, follow-through and trust in cross-functional, geographically distributed dyads. To test this hypothesis, we used our theoretical model to evaluate
the ﬁt of the data using structural equation modeling. Our ﬁrst structural equation
model (Fig. 3, SEM A) indicates that, as expected, perceived trustworthiness at
month 1 predicts perceived trustworthiness at month 3. Similarly, perceived followthrough at month 1 predicts perceived follow-through at month 3 and trust at
month 1 predicts trust at month 3. This analysis provides strong support for
hypothesis 5, suggesting stability of perceived trustworthiness, perceived followthrough, and trust over the three months that this data were collected. Although

<-----Page 17----->18

model ﬁt statistics indicate a reasonable ﬁt with the data, v2 (12, N = 108) = 19.48,
p = 0.078, modiﬁcation indices suggest that improvements are possible. In particular, a direct relationship between trust at month 1 and perceived follow-through
at month 3 and a link between perceived follow-through at month 1 and perceived
trustworthiness at month 3 would improve the ﬁt (see Fig. 3, SEM B). The revised
model ﬁt our data better, v2 (10, N = 108) = 5.236, p = 0.875, and goodness of ﬁt
indices also indicated a higher level of ﬁt (NFI = 0.998, RFI = 0.994, CFI = 1.0,
RMSEA = 0.000). The negative relationship between trust at month 1 and perceived follow-through at month 3 is signiﬁcant (b = 0.20, p < 0.01). This suggests
that lack of trust at month 1 may increase monitoring of one’s co-workers, which
could then increase perceived follow-through at month 3 by providing conﬁrming
evidence that the co-workers are performing as hoped. By the same token, high
trust at month 1 could mean less checking which leads to lower perceptions of follow-through at month 3.
In both structural equation models, we also conﬁrmed that perceived followthrough mediates the relationship between perceived trustworthiness and trust at
months 1 and 3 and that cultural diversity impedes perceptions of trustworthiness
in these dyads. In Table 3, we provide a list of our hypotheses, how they were tested, and a summary of the results.

5. Discussion
Traditional models of trust suggest that if a co-worker performs well, he or she
will be perceived as more trustworthy (see Mayer et al., 1995). We found something quite diﬀerent in the study we report here. Our ﬁndings indicate that, among
cross-functional, geographically distributed partners, if a worker is perceived as
trustworthy, he or she will be perceived as delivering on work commitments. We
reason that it may be diﬃcult for co-workers to evaluate the deliverables of colleagues from other disciplines, particularly when they are not physically collocated
and their work process is not visible. Thus, the initial perceptions of one’s coworkers may determine the extent to which one believes these co-workers have
followed through on work expectations. This points to the importance of ﬁrst
impressions in cross-functional, geographically distributed work.
An alternative explanation is that those who are perceived as more trustworthy
also are more likely to follow-through, either because the original assessment of
their trustworthiness was accurate or because the trust that was placed in them
caused them to be more diligent. Such explanations call into question existing
models of interpersonal trust, which consistently include a link between performance outcomes and perceived trustworthiness, but rarely the reverse.
The results of our longitudinal analysis further support the stability of trust in
these dyads. Perceived trustworthiness, perceived follow-through, and trust at
month 1 predicted those same variables at month 3, indicating that ﬁrst impressions played a signiﬁcant role in determining later perceptions. We do not have the
data on actual behavior required to assess the extent to which the stability we
observed is the result of ﬁrst impressions that were not updated with behavioral
data, ﬁrst impressions that were accurate to begin with and did not require updating, or initial impressions that set into motion behaviors that reinforced the status
quo. Teasing apart these alternative explanations is an important next step in
understanding the role of trust and the generalizeability of these results beyond
cross-functional, geographically distributed work.
Although our results generally suggest the stability of trust in cross-functional,
geographically distributed dyads, our longitudinal analysis also indicates that some
participants updated their perceptions of follow-through and trustworthiness. Perceived follow-through at month 1, for example, predicted perceived trustworthiness
at month 3, suggesting that co-workers’ behavior sometimes contributed to perceived trustworthiness. Although weaker than the eﬀect of perceived trustworthiness on perceived follow-though, this ﬁnding is consistent with existing models of
trust (e.g. Mayer et al., 1995) and with theories of history-based trust, which argue
that trust is an outcome of cumulative interactions between individuals and is
updated based on the trustor’s experience of the trustee’s behavior. These results
also point to the important role of perceived (not necessarily actual) followthrough in cross-functional, global work and may indicate that sharing information about work progress could help to build trust between these co-workers.
This notion is consistent with O’Leary, Orlikowski, and Yates’ (2002) study of
trust and control in the Hudson Bay Company in which they found that providing

<-----Page 19----->20

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

regular reports to headquarters went hand-in-hand with establishing trust between
distant locations.
We also found that cultural diversity was associated with lower perceived trustworthiness. This eﬀect was stronger later in the project, suggesting that it may be
the result of cultural misunderstandings rather than prejudices. Thus, the greater
the cultural diversity in cross-functional, distributed work, the more fragile the
trust as people struggle to ﬁnd common ground and search for signs of benevolence, ability, and integrity—all characteristics whose manifestations and interpretations may be heavily inﬂuenced by culture. In the study we report here, we can
merely state that cultural diversity was associated with less perceived trustworthiness. Further studies are needed to understand how culturally diverse, cross-functional, distributed co-workers negotiate their diﬀerences over space and time.
Each discipline also has its own culture created by shared professional paradigms and reinforced by education. All of the dyads in our study were cross-functional, not allowing us to compare with uni-functional dyads, but we found
evidence of discipline-based cultural diﬀerences during our qualitative work in our
pilot study. During discipline-based group discussions, members of each profession
said that they would trust a member of their own profession more than one of the
other professions, supporting our assertion that developing trust may be more
challenging in cross-functional work. The architects felt that architects were ‘‘inherently more trustworthy’’ since the architect has to coordinate the design team. The
structural engineers said that the structural engineer must be trustworthy or the
building would fall down. One construction manager jokingly said, ‘‘Architects are
useless,’’ but the construction managers all laughed at the joke. Our respondents
reported that making ‘‘personal sacriﬁces for the good of the team’’ built trust.
‘‘Seeing someone do something to save himself,’’ was described as severely damaging trust. International diﬀerences in holidays that were not discussed also caused
problems because several teams did not coordinate their spring break and left their
team members wondering where they were for two weeks. Interacting with diﬀerent
disciplines, being geographically and temporally distributed (e.g., being in diﬀerent
time zones), and relying on technology all reportedly made trust more diﬃcult.
There are several limitations to the study we report. First, the studies were conducted with student teams. Although these student teams operated in ways that are
similar to teams in the construction industry, the teams were artiﬁcial in the sense
that students were taking a class for which they would receive a grade. Because the
students were not employees of a ﬁrm, there were no immediate ﬁnancial stakes,
and they had little expectation of working with these team members on future projects, although there was some awareness of the opportunity to be recruited by the
industry mentors to work in their companies. Researchers have identiﬁed relationships between trust and work group performance that are not simple and may be
mediated by factors such as coordination and motivation (e.g. Dirks, 1999) and
may be complicated by organizational level (Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998).
Such factors are diﬃcult to replicate in student teams. In an ethnography of the
Hudson Bay Company, O’Leary and his colleagues (O’Leary et al., 2002) describe
the relationship between trust and control in a distributed work setting. In our

<-----Page 20----->R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

21

student teams, no binding contracts were signed, and students had few ways of
controlling their peers. Although this may also often be the case in non-student
work groups, the relationship between control and trust is an important one and
emphasizes the importance of conducting further research in organizational settings to understand the complexity of trust between team members and determine
the generalizeability of the results reported here.
Another important characteristic of our study setting was that team members
met face-to-face for two days at the start of the project. Others have argued for the
importance of geographically distributed teams meeting early in the life of a project
as a way of developing rapport and establishing a shared vision (Armstrong &
Cole, 2002; Kraut, Galegher, Fish, & Chalfonte, 1992). However, many distributed
teams never meet face-to-face. In those cases, we suspect that trust may be slower
to develop and swift trust based on expectations about roles will be more crucial
(see Jarvenpaa & Leidner, 1999). More research is needed to better understand the
impact of face-to-face meetings on the development and maintenance of trust in
cross-functional, geographically distributed work.
For this study, we created a measure of trust based on participants’ desire to
check and the extent to which they actually checked on their co-workers. Because
monitoring can reduce uncertainty, authors have noted that the desire to monitor
another’s behavior is directly associated with trust (Nooteboom, 2002; Wicks,
Berman, & Jones, 1999). Buskens, for example, uses the number of legal and ﬁnancial safeguards in a contract as an inverse measure of trust (Buskens, 2002). Monitoring can therefore be considered a type of safeguard in cross-functional,
distributed work where contracts are not used. Using monitoring, rather than trust
attitude, as a measure helped us to overcome the problem of many attitudinal measures that make it diﬃcult to separate trust from perceived trustworthiness. Our
measure, however, also has some limitations. First, although we were attempting to
generate an indicator of behavior, ours is not a behavioral measure. It is possible
that self-reported checking and desire to check are biased by one’s recall of the
checking event. In our study context, this could have resulted in a bias toward
more checking because of the salience of the checking events. Second, checking on
one’s co-workers is undoubtedly challenging in cross-functional, distributed work.
It requires eﬀort, is likely to be diﬃcult to do unobtrusively, and may be diﬃcult to
coordinate. Cross-functional, distributed workers may therefore monitor their coworkers infrequently, not because they trust them, but because it is too challenging
to check on them. Both of these factors suggest a possible bias in our data toward
less checking, which could indicate that less trust exists between these co-workers
than is captured by our data. Although we believe the items that measured desire
to check help to alleviate these biases, some bias may remain. Because these biases
do not aﬀect the measurement of our independent variables or the relationship
between our independent variables and trust, we anticipate that eliminating any
residual bias would strengthen our ﬁndings, but additional research is needed to
better understand the relationship between monitoring and trust between crossfunctional, distributed co-workers. Future work that observes more closely the

<-----Page 21----->22

R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

interactions between co-workers over time will help to shed light on these relationships.
Due to poor scale reliability, we were unable to assess the role of trust propensity in cross-functional, geographically distributed dyads. The scale developed by
Rotter (1971) has been used to predict trust in a number of studies (Yamagishi &
Yamagishi, 1994; Yamagishi, Cook, & Watabe, 1998). However, our measure of
trust propensity proved to have low reliability (alpha = 0.47), which contributed to
problems with prediction. We speculate that trust propensity may be more easily
observed in laboratory experiments than in working relationships, where the
strength of the context may overwhelm individual diﬀerences. We further speculate
that the international cross-cultural nature of the dyads in our study may contribute to low reliability of the scale. We believe it is necessary to conduct further
research to determine the importance of trust propensity in predicting trust within
cross-functional, global work.
Finally, the model that we developed and the conclusions that we draw are for
dyads conducting cross-functional, geographically distributed work. Because we
did not compare cross-functional with uni-functional dyads or distributed dyads
with collocated dyads, we are not able to draw conclusions about the diﬀerences
that exist or about trust in traditional dyads. We anticipate that uni-functional
dyads rely more heavily on behavioral indicators of follow-through than on perceptions about the trustworthiness of co-workers to assess follow-through. We also
suspect that cross-functional, geographically distributed workers may be less able
to gather information about their co-workers and objectively assess co-workers’
follow-through. Thus, we believe that assessments of follow-through may be particularly subjective in cross-functional, distributed work. These comparisons are left
for future research.

6. Conclusion
In this study, we tested a model of trust modiﬁed to reﬂect the context of crossfunctional, geographically distributed work. In contrast to traditional models of
trust, we found that perceived trustworthiness may determine perceived followthrough rather than the reverse. Based on our ﬁndings, we oﬀer several recommendations for those who manage or are engaged in cross-functional, geographically
distributed work. First, our results reinforce the importance of building rapport
and trust early in a project. In particular, creating an environment in which coworkers can evaluate one another’s perceived trustworthiness (benevolence, ability,
and integrity) may help to set the tone for the partnership well into the future. Creating opportunities to assess trustworthiness is especially important in cross-functional and cross-cultural relationships where trustworthiness may be more diﬃcult
and time-consuming to evaluate accurately. Second, our ﬁndings suggest that trust,
once established, may be fairly stable in cross-functional, global work. If high
levels of trust are established early in the development of the partnership, this may
be beneﬁcial. It may also, however, increase project risk if trusted partners fail to

<-----Page 22----->R. Zolin et al. / Information and Organization 14 (2004) 1–26

23

deliver, but continue to be perceived as following through. It is therefore important
that information is shared and reviews be instituted so that risk can be averted.
