Behavioral strategy merges cognitive and social psychology with strategic management theory
and practice. Despite much progress, the aims and boundaries of behavioral strategy remain
unclear. In this paper we define behavioral strategy and identify the main unsolved problems. We
propose a unifying conceptual framework for behavioral strategy and conclude by introducing
the papers of the Special Issue on the Psychological Foundations of Strategic Management.

INTRODUCTION
Behavioral strategy applies cognitive and social
psychology to strategic management theory and
practice. It aims to strengthen the empirical integrity and practical usefulness of strategy theory
by grounding strategic management in realistic
assumptions about human cognition, emotion, and
social interaction.
Of course, this is not a new idea. Psychology influenced the early development of business
policy and strategy and continues to influence
strategic management through many streams of
research: behavioral decision research (Kahneman

and Zietsma, 2007); the behavioral theory of the
firm (Cyert and March, 1963; Bromiley, 2005;
Gavetti, Levinthal, and Ocasio, 2007); cognitive
schema, maps, sensemaking, and cognitive rivalry
(Porac and Thomas, 1990; Reger and Huff, 1993;
Lant and Baum, 1995; Weick, 1995); and topics such as escalation (Staw, 1981), aspirations
(Greve, 1998), attribution (Salancik and Meindl,
1984), attention (Ocasio, 1997), emotions (Nickerson and Zenger, 2008), CEO pathology (Kets de
Vries and Miller, 1984), hubris (Bollaert and Petit,
2010), and top management teams (Hambrick and
Mason, 1984). Papers on dominant logic (Prahalad and Bettis, 1986) and the myopia of learning
(Levinthal and March, 1993) received the SMJ
Best Paper Prize.
We believe the time has come for new beginnings in behavioral strategy, for three reasons.
First, strategic management has not kept pace with

<-----Page 1----->1370

behavioral movements in economics and finance.
This is surprising, since strategy research has fewer
inhibiting assumptions about decision rationality.
Nonetheless, behavioral economics and behavioral
finance have led the way in generating new ideas
and research methods and in building intellectual bridges with psychology and neuroscience.
We believe behavioral strategy can do the same
in strategic management.
Second, strategic management theory lacks adequate psychological grounding. Strategy theory has
converged on a view that the crucial problem in
strategic management is firm heterogeneity—why
firms adopt different strategies and structures,
why heterogeneity persists, and why competitors
perform differently. Given these aims, existing
theories are surprisingly parochial, explaining heterogeneity as Bainian market power protected by
monopoly barriers, Penrosian resource advantages
protected by factor scarcity, and Schumpeterian
innovation driven by entrepreneurship and technology. These are the three pillars of strategic
management theory.1
Do these theories really explain firm heterogeneity? Recent performance shocks of companies like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and BP,
and failed mergers such as AOL/Time-Warner and
HP/Compaq, evidently do not stem from monopoly
rents, factor scarcity, or entrepreneurship. The
facts overwhelmingly implicate poor executive
judgment, or larger macro-cultures of poor judgment. Conversely, sound executive judgment, and
contextual architectures that promote sound judgment, can enhance firm performance. Until strategy
theory builds stronger foundations in psychology,
it will struggle to explain the facts of firm performance. To achieve empirical fidelity, we believe
the field needs a robust subfield of behavioral
strategy to serve as the fourth pillar of strategic
management theory.
Third, recent developments provide new opportunities for merging psychology and strategy.
Advances in cognitive neuroscience make it possible to examine brain activity in strategic decisions, and these technologies have spread quickly
in economics, politics, marketing, and other social
sciences. In experimental psychology, researchers
are increasingly turning to multimethod research
1

This is not to minimize other key influences, such as institutional theories (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Oliver, 1997) and the
bargaining view (Lippman and Rumelt, 2003).

designs, for example combining mathematical
modelling, simulation, behavioral experiments,
field interviews, and brain scans to gain multiple perspectives on the same phenomenon. These
developments are nascent, but as strategic management matures as a field, psychology offers a rich
source of insights in theory and method.
Behavioral strategy has the luxury of building
on past research in cognition, behavioral decision theory, organizational behavior, and strategy.
But much work remains to be done. Behavioral
strategy is a patchwork of theories and findings,
and cognitive psychology has not captured the
hearts and minds of strategy researchers. In business schools, strategy departments routinely hire
economists and sociologists, but seldom psychologists. Indeed, despite a large volume of output,
experimental psychology has done little to address
the problems of strategy theory and practice. Many
strategy researchers regard the core unit of analysis in strategy as the firm or business unit rather
than the individual, and there is skepticism about
the scaling of psychological concepts to firms and
industries. Strategy practitioners are, if anything,
more skeptical than researchers, doubting whether
the field can go beyond cognitive biases to produce useful frameworks that integrate psychology
and strategy practice.
To some degree, the problem comes down to
inadequate paradigm development in behavioral
strategy. The term ‘behavioral strategy’ is not
widely used and means different things to different people. Behavioral strategy does not have an
agreed statement of purpose, definition of boundaries, conceptual framework, core research problems, methodological standards, communities of
scholarship, or supporting institutions (such as an
interest group in the Strategic Management Society). Despite more than 30 years of research, the
output as a whole lacks integration and is too
detached from central concerns in the field. A
recent review of interdisciplinary influences on
strategic management included economics, sociology, and marketing, but not psychology (Nag,
Hambrick, and Chen, 2007). Quoting Mintzberg,
Ahlstrand, and Lampel’s (1998: 172) review of
the ‘cognitive school’ of strategy: ‘this school is
characterized more by its potential than by its contributions. The central idea is valid. . .but strategic management has yet to gain sufficiently from
cognitive psychology. Or, perhaps more accurately, cognitive psychology has yet to address
Strat. Mgmt. J., 32: 1369–1386 (2011)

<-----Page 2----->Special Issue Introduction
adequately the questions of prime interest to strategic management.’
On the positive side, there are signs that strategy scholars recognize these problems. Symposia
in behavioral strategy have become a mainstay in
recent Academy of Management meetings, supported by the Academy’s Management and
Organizational Cognition Division and with increasing submissions and attendance. Journal editors report an increasing number of submissions
linking strategy and psychology, and more are
being published. The SMJ Special Issue on the
Psychological Foundations of Strategic Management received an unprecedented number of submissions, and the range and quality of the papers
were impressive. On the whole, there are reasons
for optimism in behavioral strategy.
The remainder of this paper sketches, in broad
outline, a vision for the future of behavioral strategy. The next section defines the field, gives a
typology of existing research, and proposes four
core research problems in behavioral strategy. The
subsequent section presents an integrated conceptual view of the field, and the concluding section
introduces the papers in the Special Issue. We do
not presume to have all the answers, but we are
convinced that behavioral strategy has much to
contribute to strategic management and that scholars can take positive steps to make it happen.

DEFINING BEHAVIORAL STRATEGY
We define behavioral strategy as follows:
Behavioral strategy merges cognitive and
social psychology with strategic management
theory and practice. Behavioral strategy aims
to bring realistic assumptions about human
cognition, emotions, and social behavior to
the strategic management of organizations
and, thereby, to enrich strategy theory, empirical research, and real-world practice.
This definition is based on two assumptions.
First, we assume that behavioral strategy needs
theoretical grounding in cognitive and social psychology. The definition allows many research topics and methods, but we intend it to exclude
work that lacks rigorous theoretical grounding
in psychology. At the same time, we intend it
Copyright  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

to encourage a wide range of psychology perspectives, and our definition of ‘cognitive and
social psychology’ is probably broader than most;
for example, we do not exclude nonexperimental
methods, and we believe that behavioral strategy is
best supported by multiple methods and measures.
Second, we assume that the crucial problem
in behavioral strategy is not a shortage of good
research, but a lack of conceptual unity. The
field does not need more psychology research per
se, but more integration of appropriate psychology into strategic management theory. We do not
promote psychology for its own sake, but for
achieving two specific aims—bringing strategy
theory closer to the empirical facts and integrating
strategy research with strategy practice.
With these caveats in mind, our definition embraces topics in the existing core of behavioral
strategy (such as decision biases and cognitive
schema), while encouraging innovations that go
beyond the status quo (which we will discuss).
Research methodologies may include experiments,
mathematical modelling, simulations, brain imaging, field studies, ethnography, and textual analysis, always with a preference for multimethod
studies. We believe methodological diversity will
prove essential for improving our understanding of
individual and social behavior in organizations.
Behavioral strategy encompasses a mindboggling diversity of topics and methods. As
shown in previous reviews, conceptual unity has
been hard to achieve and the domain of possible research is, to say the least, varied (see, for
example, Hodgkinson and Healey, 2008; Hodgkinson, 2008; Walsh, 1995; Eisenhardt and Zbaracki,
1992).
On the other hand, the diversity of behavioral
strategy research mirrors, to a large degree, actual
diversity in the empirical domain. This is shown
more clearly in Table 1, which categorizes existing
research into three schools of thought, which we
call the Reductionist, Pluralist, and Contextualist
schools (see Tetlock, 1990, 2000).
Reductionist research relies on positivist, realist, and objectivist philosophies of science and
favors quantitative hypothesis testing using methods such as mathematical modelling, simulation,
and laboratory decision experiments. The Reductionist school is influenced by theoretical work
in behavioral decision research (Edwards, 1954,
1961; Tversky and Kahneman, 1974; Kahneman
and Tversky, 1979; Nisbett and Ross, 1980) and

has made important contributions in strategic decision making, cognitive biases, risk perception,
and intertemporal choice. Examples of the Reductionist influence in strategy include Duhaime and
Schwenk (1985) on cognitive errors in acquisition and divestment, Camerer and Lovallo (1999)
on overconfidence and market entry, March and
Shapira (1987) on managerial risk preferences, and
Bromiley (2009) on prospect theory and resource
allocation. Much of the recent progress in behavioral game theory and neuroeconomics derives
from Reductionist assumptions (Camerer, 2003;
Camerer, Loewenstein, and Prelec, 2005).
Pluralist research is so named because it draws
on multiple theoretical traditions and uses methods ranging from case studies and simulations to
large sample field research. The Pluralist school
is grounded in positivist, nominalist, pragmatist,
or evolutionary philosophies of science. Pluralist
research is less concerned with individual decision
making than with the overall decision environment of the firm. Combining behavioral decision
theory with political theory (March, 1962; Wildavsky, 1972), organization theory (March and
Simon, 1958), and social cognition psychology
(Fiske and Taylor, 2008; Bandura, 1977; Festinger, 1954), Pluralist research studies the consequences of bounded rationality, group conflict,
learning, and executive decision making in organizations. Examples of Pluralist influence in strategy
include Cohen and Levinthal (1990) on absorptive

capacity, Fiol (1991) on organization culture and
identity, Terry and Callan (1998) on ingroup bias
and merger, and Fiegenbaum, Hart, and Schendel
(1996) on strategic reference groups.
The Contextualist school is grounded in phenomenological, constructivist, and critical philosophies of science. Contextualist research is
concerned with management perception, sensemaking, cognitive schema, language, meaning, and
enacted environments. The school is ‘contextual’
in emphasizing the primacy of context—claiming,
for example, that the difference between a seasoned executive in the boardroom and a subject
playing an ultimatum game in a lab experiment is
ontologically large. As such, Contextualists conduct empirical work ‘in context,’ favoring qualitative and interpretive methods such as ethnography
and textual analysis and rejecting positivism and
quantitative hypothesis testing. In the Contextualist view, subjective beliefs, shared ideologies,
and cognitive frames matter more than explicit
ex ante decisions, which seldom correspond with
what people or firms actually do. Examples of the
Contextualist influence in strategy include Bougon,
Weick, and Binkhorst (1977) on cognition in a jazz
orchestra, Brunsson (1982) on ideology and action
rationality, Starbuck and Milliken (1988a) on the
Challenger disaster, and Hodgkinson, Maule, and
Bown (2004) on cognitive mapping.
The three schools give only a rough picture
of research in behavioral strategy. The schools

are not as clearly bounded as the table suggests,
and hybrid approaches shade into one another by
degrees. Some researchers operate in more than
one school, which is not surprising—the typology
categorizes outputs rather than people, and many
researchers work from multiple points of view.
Table 1 brings the extreme heterogeneity of
behavioral strategy into sharp relief. There is little agreement, even on issues as fundamental as
the unit of analysis, with Reductionists focusing on individual judgments and decision making,
Pluralists on organizationally situated managers
or groups, and Contextualists on cognitive maps,
schema, and management perceptions. All too
often, researchers in different schools study similar problems with minimal concern for crossfertilization or knowledge accumulation. In the
end, researchers have produced an impressive volume of output, much of it very insightful, but
with little or no collective synergy. As a whole,
the enterprise resembles a growth-driven conglomerate more than a focused, competence-driven
corporation.
Many scholars believe that behavioral strategy could achieve greater synergies by redefining its boundaries—for example, by focusing on
one of the three schools of behavioral strategy.
The preferred candidate is often the Reductionist
school, following the examples of economics and
finance. According to this view, a tightly defined
field of behavioral strategy, focused on measurement, experiment, and hypothesis testing, with new
extensions into cognitive neuroscience, offers the
best chance of paradigmatic unity and cumulative
progress.
The Reductionist school will play a major role in
the future of behavioral strategy. However, we do
not advocate restricting behavioral strategy to one
school of thought. The diversity in Table 1 is not
an aberration but an inherent feature of psychology
and the empirical domain of strategic management.
The Reductionist school cannot cover the problem
space of behavioral strategy, and none of the three
schools has a monopoly on truth. Strategic outcomes stem from individuals, groups, and organizations interacting in uncertain environments. We
believe diversity is the only reasonable option and
that leveraging and integrating the three schools of
thought should become the first priority of behavioral strategy.
So how can behavioral strategy move toward
intellectual unity? Instead of restricting its toolkit
Copyright  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

of theories and methods, we believe that behavioral
strategy should apply all of its tools to a smaller
number of core research problems. The unsystematic approach of the past has left many opportunities neglected and gaps to be filled. Collectively,
the field has been ineffective in using psychology to build strategy theory or link theory with
practice.
The remainder of this section identifies four
core research problems in behavioral strategy. The
problems span all three schools of behavioral strategy and need contributions from each. By applying
their respective strengths to the core problems and
by finding imaginative ways to interact and collaborate, we believe the Reductionist, Pluralist, and
Contextualist schools can work synergistically to
accumulate theoretical and applied knowledge.

HOW DOES INDIVIDUAL COGNITION
SCALE TO COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR?
Cognitive psychology focuses on mental processes
within an individual, whereas strategic management has traditionally focused on the firm, business
unit, or corporation. We believe the perceived gap
between individual cognition and collective strategy has done more to impede behavioral strategy
than any other problem.
Decision researchers often assume the strategic
actions of firms reflect choices by a CEO or top
management team. This assumption may indeed
hold if the firm is small, entrepreneurial, autocratic,
or family owned or if the decision falls outside
annual planning processes (Lovallo and Sibony,
2010). But research in behavioral strategy must
avoid the trap of making simplistic assumptions
about mental scaling—for example, assuming that
a firm or corporation has the psychology of an individual, that one person chooses for the collective,
that the firm’s actions correspond to a person’s
decisions, or that many individual choices sum to
a collective choice.
Behavioral strategy has a long way to go in
linking individual psychology with organizational
strategies. One of the distinctive features of strategic management is its emphasis on collective
behavior, and behavioral strategy must explain
the psychological or social mechanisms by which
mental processes affect organizations. Researchers’
scaling assumptions can and should be made
explicit (Elster, 1982; Ostrom, 1997) and in
Strat. Mgmt. J., 32: 1369–1386 (2011)
DOI: 10.1002/smj

<-----Page 6----->Special Issue Introduction
behavioral strategy, the whole question is how
particular forms of behavior arise in and among
organizations. If we do not show the mechanism,
we do not explain the phenomenon.
The problem of aggregation is not unique to
behavioral strategy. Behavioral economists since
at least Schelling (1978) have studied relationships between individual choices and collective
outcomes. Fehr and Tyran (2005) argued that the
mode of aggregation depends on market conditions—in particular, whether ‘strategic substitutability’ or ‘strategic complementarity’ determine
aggregate outcomes. Substitutability obtains when
the presence of a few rational decision makers
is enough to produce collective rationality; complementarity obtains when a small number of
irrational decision makers can skew collective outcomes. For example, Firm A’s decision to increase
output may influence Firm B not to build a new
plant (substitutability), whereas Firm A’s decision
to cut price may cause Firm B to cut price even
more (complementarity). As Fehr and Tyran (2005:
43) note, ‘there is no general reason to believe that
markets automatically render individual decisions
more rational over time.’
In behavioral finance, researchers have studied
how noise traders affect market outcomes. In the
model proposed by DeLong et al. (1991), it is possible for irrational traders to earn higher returns
than rational investors and dominate the market
in the long run. Barber, Heath, and Odean (2003)
compared the investment strategies of individuals
and groups (stock clubs). They found that groups,
to a greater extent than individuals, try to justify
their stock choices with defensible reasons. Groups
do this even when their choices contradict sound
investment policy—for example, justifying popular growth stocks over lesser-known value stocks.
In this context, cognitive scaling stems less from
‘complementarity’ (increasing returns to individual irrationality) than from the social psychology
of group membership: ‘in situations where people
must exchange reasons to convince others. . .the
process we document may yield alternatives that
have notable disadvantages but that happen to
come attached to a good reason.’ (DeLong et al.,
1991: 1651).
In social psychology and behavioral decision
theory, researchers have dealt in various ways
with the aggregation of mental processes, some
of which offer insights to behavioral strategy.
This includes research on groupthink (Janis, 1972),
Copyright  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1375

group polarization (Isenberg, 1986), common
information sampling bias (Stasser and Titus,
1985), social facilitation (Zajonc, 1965), social
loafing (Latane, Williams, and Harkins, 1979),
and transactive memory systems, through which
groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve
knowledge (Wegner, 1987).
The problem of scaling has also been addressed
in management science and organization theory.
From Reductionist assumptions, Marschak (1955)
proposed a mathematical model of team production. From Contextualist assumptions, Harris
(1994) examined how organizations, groups, and
cultures are represented in the cognitive schema of
individuals. From a Pluralist perspective, Freeman
(1999) surveyed aggregation issues arising from
transaction cost and agency theories. Freeman’s
(1999: 175) conclusions about organizational psychology also apply to behavioral strategy: ‘if
organizational psychology is simply psychology
applied to people who happen to be located in
organizations, then it is hard to see why a separate field is needed. . .(A) way out of the box is to
posit a true social psychology of organizations: a
theory of aggregation that explains how individuals combine their behaviors to produce collective
outcomes.’
Freeman (1999) did not propose a ‘way out
of the box,’ but he recommended as a starting
point the organization theories of Cyert, March,
Simon, and colleagues at Carnegie. The behavioral theory of the firm views organizations as
comprised of differentiated subunits with conflicting goals, resources, and time horizons (Cyert
and March, 1963). In the Carnegie view, organizational strategy is largely a political process,
involving coalition building, bargaining, and conflict resolution among representatives of differentiated subunits (see also Lawrence and Lorsch,
1967; Bower, 1970; Miles and Snow, 1978). The
CEO must orchestrate an organization-wide political process, and subunit managers face what
Blake (1959) called the ‘crisis of statesmanship,’
in which they try to reconcile firm-level priorities
with personal goals and political status with peers
and constituents.
We agree with Freeman that the Carnegie model
offers a solid foundation for linking individual
psychology with organizational strategy (see also
Bromiley, 2005; Argote and Greve, 2007). The
model’s emphasis on bargaining and political processes allows researchers to deploy a range of

ideas in social cognition and group identification,
including self-categorization, conformity, obedience, status, reputation, accountability, trust, social
learning, and reference groups (Fiske and Taylor, 2008; Bandura, 1977; Tajfel, 1978; Turner,
1975; Festinger, 1954). The psychology of identification, and research on social identity in particular, offers many avenues for bridging the gap
between individual cognition and organizational
strategy (Haslam, 2004; Ashforth and Mael, 1989;
Hogg and Terry, 2000; Dutton, Dukerich, and Harquail, 1994; Huber and Lewis, 2010). For example, Terry and Callan (1998) used social identity
theory to examine out-group bias in a hospital
merger; Rumelt (1995) proposed a model linking
psychology and organizational inertia through subunit conflict resolution; and Livengood and Reger
(2010) combined identity theory with awarenessmotivation-capability (AMC) theory to explore
competitive interactions (see also Huy, 2011).
The scaling problem is far from solved, and it is
often improperly framed. As Freeman (1999) suggested, the question is not about scaling or aggregation per se, which assume a kind of adding up
of individual cognition. Rather the question is how
we integrate individual and collective psychology
in organizations to produce a social psychology
of behavioral strategy. The behavioral theory of
the firm is a good starting point, and Reductionist and Contextualist approaches (including social
neuroscience) can add texture and insight to the
Carnegie view. To deal effectively with the problem, the field needs contributions from all three
schools of behavioral strategy.

WHAT ARE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
UNDERPINNINGS OF STRATEGIC
MANAGEMENT THEORY?
In 2008, a proposal for an Academy of Management symposium on behavioral strategy began:
‘Strategy is concerned with finding profit
opportunities. In teaching as well as practice,
the implicit assumption is that not all opportunities have been exploited. Rather, there is
money left on the table. We argue that an
appropriate theoretical foundation for strategy should start with the assumption that
there are arbitrage opportunities. . .The purpose of this symposium is to bring together
Copyright  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

researchers from strategy, behavioral finance,
and behavioral decision theory/economics to
examine the issue of market efficiency and
strategy. The idea is not to review research
on biases and irrationality. Rather, the ambition is to flesh out a research agenda for
‘behavioral strategy.” (Winter et al., 2008)
The proposal then identified five research questions in behavioral strategy:
• When and why are resources and input factors
undervalued?
• When and why can arbitrage opportunities exist
in factor and product markets?
• What are the limits to arbitrage in factor and
product markets?
• What are the implications for strategy?
• Is a normative theory of strategy possible?
These questions do not, in our opinion, constitute the whole of behavioral strategy. However,
they raise important issues in strategic management research, some of which can be addressed
through a closer alignment of psychology and
strategy.
Denrell, Fang, and Winter (2003) argue that
strategy theories rely too much on theories of
market efficiency and equilibrium. If market participants acted optimally on information about
resources and market positions, firms could not
improve performance by following systematic
rules. In strategy theory, there are ‘no rules for
riches;’ if such a rule existed, other firms would
follow it and compete away its value (Barney,
1986). However, managers do take actions that
improve firm performance, and not all of these
actions can be ascribed to luck. According to Denrell et al. (2003: 978), ‘the discovery of a valuable
strategic opportunity is often a matter of ‘serendipity’ in the strict sense—not just luck, but effort and
luck joined by alertness and flexibility. To appreciate these points it is necessary to break out of
the equilibrium mindset that dominates so much
of economic theory.’
It is possible that firms differ from each other
for precisely the reasons emphasized in strategy
theory, such as resource scarcity, mobility barriers, causal ambiguity, and uncertain imitability. However, this assumes market participants
are paying attention to markets and acting on
what they know. An alternative hypothesis is that
Strat. Mgmt. J., 32: 1369–1386 (2011)
DOI: 10.1002/smj

<-----Page 8----->Special Issue Introduction
firms generally fail to capture their opportunities,
solve their problems, or imitate imitable resources
(Powell, 2004). This could happen, for example,
if decision makers are subject to self-confirming
beliefs (Ryall, 2003), overoptimism in strategic
forecasting (Lovallo and Kahneman, 2003), competitive blind spots (Zajac and Bazerman, 1991),
self-interested causal attributions (Powell, Lovallo,
and Caringal, 2006), disordered learning processes
(Denrell, 2008), institutional conformity (Abrahamson, 1991), unwillingness to imitate (Jonsson
and Regner, 2009), or perceptual filtering (Starbuck and Milliken, 1988b). Suboptimal behavior
could also emerge from emotions such as envy,
prejudice, anger, hubris, and impulsivity (Elfenbein, 2007; Rafaeli and Sutton 1989; Postrel and
Rumelt, 1992), which can jeopardize or improve
performance (Staw and Barsade, 1993; Huy, 1999;
Pfeffer and Sutton, 1999; Howard, 1993). Even
large firms might behave erratically due to poor
executive judgment, as we observe. Under any
such conditions, some market participants would
find opportunities to adopt strategies that improve
firm performance. As Bromiley and Papenhausen
(2003: 432) point out, ‘the entire ‘no rules for
riches’ story. . .collapses if we have rules that could
improve performance. This would arise when some
firms either do not know the rules exist or do not
act on them.’
Studies show that actual distributions of firm
profitability are consistent with generating processes that contain a great deal of randomness
(Levinthal, 1991; Powell, 2003; Denrell, 2004),
and some forms of competitive behavior derive
from the inherent uncertainty or randomness of
markets (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001; Lippman and Rumelt, 1982). For example, corporate
success induces self-serving attributions, and executives are likely to attribute success to their own
abilities, even when success is due to excessive
risk taking or luck (Salancik and Meindl, 1984). If
executive decisions are informed by false or overconfident attributions, some market participants
may find it possible to exploit market opportunities
(Denrell and Fang, 2010).
We agree with those who argue that strategic management theory needs deep reformulation
along behavioral lines. The assumption that firm
heterogeneity stems from economic barriers does
not align with what we know about human cognition, emotions, learning, social interactions, and
institutions. Until theories of firm heterogeneity

fully incorporate psychology, the empirical facts
will continue to frustrate our attempts to explain
them, and researchers will find it impossible to
integrate theory with strategy practice.

CAN BEHAVIORAL STRATEGY
EXPLAIN COMPLEX EXECUTIVE
JUDGMENTS?
Research in behavioral decision theory (BDT)
shows that individuals lack the cognitive capacity to make fully informed and unbiased decisions
in complex environments (Kahneman, Slovic, and
Tversky, 1982; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson,
1988). To cope with complex judgments and decisions, people use simplifying heuristics that are
prone to systematic biases. Decision makers do not
maximize the subjective expected utility of total
wealth, but focus on deviations from cognitive reference points. BDT has found many applications
in the social sciences, including strategic management (Bazerman and Moore, 2008).
BDT has not yet realized its full potential in
strategic management (Hodgkinson and Sparrow,
2002). It does not link seamlessly with strategy
theory and it has not made large impacts on
strategy practice. The decision context of strategic management involves organizationally situated managers, widespread uncertainty, and poorly
defined problems with unknowable social and economic consequences. In the circumstances, we
believe strategy research should increase its
emphasis on executive judgment in the actual conditions of high-stakes, complex problem solving in
organizations.
Management scholars have always recognized
the complexity of strategic problem solving in
organizations. Peter Drucker (1974) viewed executive work as a practice, not unlike problem solving
in medicine, architecture, military affairs, and foreign policy. He wrote that ‘decision making is not
a mechanical job. It is risk-taking and a challenge
to judgment. The ‘right answer’ (which usually
cannot be found anyway) is not central. Central
is understanding of the problem. Decision making,
further, is not an intellectual exercise. It mobilizes
the vision, energies and resources of the organization for effective action’ (Drucker, 1974: 480).
Herbert Simon (1987) distinguished two kinds
of organizational decisions: logical and judgmental. Simon cited Chester Barnard, who defined
Strat. Mgmt. J., 32: 1369–1386 (2011)
DOI: 10.1002/smj

<-----Page 9----->1378

T. C. Powell, D. Lovallo, and C. R. Fox

‘logical’ decisions as those involving ‘conscious
thinking which could be expressed in words or
by other symbols,’ whereas judgmental decisions,
which Barnard called ‘non-logical,’ were those
‘not capable of being expressed in words or as
reasoning, which are only made known by judgment, decision or action’ (Simon, 1987: 57). Going
further, Barnard (1938: 302) wrote: ‘the sources
of these non-logical processes lie in physiological conditions or factors, or in the physical and
social environment, mostly impressed upon us
unconsciously. . .They also consist of the mass of
facts, patterns, concepts, techniques, abstractions,
and generally what we call formal knowledge or
beliefs, which are impressed upon our minds more
or less by conscious effort and study.’
Simon (1987) linked judgment to expert intuition, drawing analogies to expert computer systems and pattern recognition in chess and medicine.
But Simon (1987) recognized that executive judgment in organizations involves more than programmable or expert intuition. Exactly what it
does involve was unclear then and remains unclear
today. After reviewing two studies on executive
judgment, Simon (1987: 61) concluded that ‘these
two pieces of research are just drops of water in
a large bucket that needs filling. The description,
in detail, of the use of judgmental and analytical
processes in expert problem solving and decision
making deserves a high priority in the agenda of
management research.’
Complex judgments have indeed received attention in decision research—for example, Janis and
Mann (1977) developed a descriptive theory of
conflict in complex policy decisions, and Klein
(1998) has described intuition and judgment in a
variety of applied contexts (see also Kahneman and
Klein, 2009). Judgment has also been addressed in
strategic management (Priem and Cycyota, 2001;
Hodgkinson, Langan-Fox, and Sadler-Smith, 2008;
Schoemaker, 1990). However, Simon’s statement
generally holds true today. Strategy research has
not produced enough empirical research on complex judgments and does not have a unified view
of complex problem solving in organizations. Perhaps the ‘decision’ is not the right unit of analysis
in behavioral strategy, or not always the right unit.
One of the key challenges in behavioral strategy
research is to show how decisions fit within the
larger and more complex domain of strategic problem solving in organizations.

CAN WE IMPROVE THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE
OF THE FIRM?
Researchers have proposed a variety of methods
for overcoming decision biases (Kahneman et al.,
1982, chapters 28–32; Russo and Schoemaker,
2002). Schwenk and Thomas (1983) proposed a
framework for matching strategy problems with
decision aids such as dialectical inquiry, devil’s
advocacy, scenario analysis, and the Delphi procedure; Soll and Larrick (2009) found that people
generally do better when they average between two
proposed solutions than when they choose one or
the other; Gawande (2009) claimed that introducing checklists reduced errors in health care management and construction; and Donaldson (2010)
proposed ways for managers to minimize sampling
biases and other errors in statistical reasoning.
Despite these methods, individual biases persist
in organizations. As Tetlock (2000: 324) points
out, decision biases are not ‘merely atavistic vestiges of a more primitive social order, soon to
be swept away by the intensification of competitive market forces.’ In organizations, people
operate in a world of subgroup norms, political ideologies, consensus building, and self-presentation.
Cognitive biases are deeply embedded in routines,
automatic behavior, psycho-physical distortions,
and executives’ knowledge structures. In practice, emotional, social, and political realities nearly
always trump decision aids in their influence on
organizational judgments.
This raises two questions:
• What are the intended and unintended
consequences of individual de-biasing in
organizations?
• Is it possible to design the psychological architecture of the firm, including both choice architecture and decision processes, to yield better
executive judgments?
Thaler and Sunstein (2008) argued that researchers should accept that decision makers are ordinary human beings with faulty cognition and poor
self control. Instead of trying to fix the hardwired
errors of individual cognition, organizations should
focus on managing the psychological architecture
of the choice environment—for example, by conspicuously displaying the running costs of manufacturing equipment or designing work spaces that
Strat. Mgmt. J., 32: 1369–1386 (2011)
DOI: 10.1002/smj

<-----Page 10----->Special Issue Introduction
encourage people to seek alternative points of view
(see also Johnson et al., 2011). The authors argue
that ecological ‘nudges,’ supplemented by rewards
and incentives, offer a workable and humanfriendly alternative to explicit decision aids.
Arkes (1991) distinguished three types of
errors—strategy-based, association-based, and
psycho-physically-based—and Larrick (2004)
argued that remediation methods should fit the
type of error. Heath, Larrick, and Klayman (1998)
divided organizational repairs into two categories:
motivational repairs, which increase the energy
and enthusiasm with which people work; and
cognitive repairs, which prevent mental errors
or improve decision processes. For example, as
motivational repairs, managers could increase the
decision autonomy of project teams or redesign
common areas to enhance ‘psychological capital’
(Luthans, Youssef, and Avolio, 2007); as cognitive
repairs, managers could address overoptimism in
forecasting by investing in training and databases
for case-based decision making.
Denrell and March (2001) argued that many
errors in learning and inference derive from dysfunctional learning environments and would exist
even if all decision makers were rational. For
example, consider an executive team choosing how
to enter a foreign market. Suppose the firm has
previous experience in market entry by joint venture once (a failure) and by acquisition four times
(two successes and two failures). By the structure
of the selection process, the team has asymmetric
information—i.e., more information about acquisitions than joint ventures. Hence, it has learned
the conditions under which acquisitions succeed
and fail and is likely to choose a form of acquisition that succeeded in the past. Since the team
has minimal information about joint ventures, and
all of it is bad, it eliminates this option (the ‘hot
stove effect’). This is true even if joint venture is
the optimal choice but requires competence building by repeat experience. This is not cognitive bias
but an anomaly in the adaptive learning process.
Rational selection demands the search for successful options and avoidance of failed options. As
a side consequence, it produces undersampling of
failure (see also Markle, 2011).
Lovallo and Sibony (2010) distinguished between recurrent strategic decisions, such as resource allocations in R&D projects, and large oneoff decisions for which the firm lacks established
choice processes, such as responding to a new

market entrant. To minimize decision biases, the
authors recommend that firms link their strategic
decisions with known decision biases and create
choice architectures for dealing with the biases
they actually face. For example, all large pharmaceutical firms engage in basic research and
are repeatedly susceptible to escalation bias and
the politics of internal resource allocation. Most
firms link R&D investments to the annual planning cycle, in which each business line makes
a case for resources. However, one leading firm
addressed escalation bias proactively by forming
a detached ‘divestment team’ that scans internal
projects year-round for possible retirement. Can
such mechanisms lead to better resource allocations and, ultimately, to higher returns? Given
the difficulties of repairing individual biases, firmlevel solutions may offer the best way forward.
The psychological design of organizations is
a promising area for strategy research. Experience suggests that judgmental errors stem from
a combination of cognitive errors and the context of choice. On the whole, individual cognitive
errors have received more attention than the psychological architecture of the firm, even though
the latter now appears more conducive to positive intervention (see Kahneman and Klein, 2009).
We believe that future research should give equal
time to the psychological architectures of collective choice.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
As a nascent field of study, behavioral strategy
faces two opposing threats: the threat of irrelevance by focusing too narrowly on one model
(such as BDT or cognitive schema); and the threat
of fragmentation by trying to appease every point
of view in strategy and psychology. In our opinion, behavioral strategy needs to follow a middle
path, recognizing the diversity of the tasks it faces,
while focusing on a small number of core problems. Behavioral strategy may converge to one
paradigm in a future generation (though we think
this is unlikely); in the meantime, behavioral strategy needs to find unity within diversity.
The good news is that the scope of behavioral
strategy is not infinite. The field may have multiple
paradigms, but it does not have 40 or 50 of them.
Figure 1 depicts the conceptual model we have in
mind.

CONTEXTUALISM

Behavioral strategy: an integrative view

In Figure 1, the domain of behavioral strategy
is bounded by its three main schools of thought:
Reductionism, Pluralism, and Contextualism. Each
school tells part of the truth about behavioral strategy; each can reasonably be called a paradigm. The
Reductionist paradigm deals with the psychological character of economic decision making, which
is best studied quantitatively and experimentally;
its core model is behavioral decision theory. The
Pluralist paradigm deals with the psychological
character of complex political judgments in large
organizations and is best studied by observations
in the field; its core model is the internally differentiated organization. The Contextualist paradigm
deals with the character of management perceptions and mental frames and is best studied by
interpretive, symbolic, ethnographic, or hermeneutic methods; its core model is schema theory.
In past research, the three paradigms operated
in relative independence. Economically inclined
researchers conducted experiments on biases,
heuristics, and experiments; organizationally inclined researchers studied CEOs, top management
teams, and organization structures; sociologically
inclined researchers studied cognitive frames, perceptions, and schema.
At the same time, some researchers operated
in more than one paradigm—people like Herbert
Simon, James March, Karl Weick, Barry Staw,
Sidney Winter, and Bill Starbuck—and many
researchers still do. We take this as evidence that
the three paradigms are not incompatible and that
research in behavioral strategy can combine a wide
field of vision with a capacity for disciplinary
integration.
These are the traits that behavioral strategy
needs to cultivate as a field of study. On one
side, we recognize that researchers need to work
Copyright  2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

on well-defined problems within their domains of
specialization. On the other, we do not see a contradiction in seeking within-paradigm and acrossparadigm contributions, along with a greater degree
of openness (Bendersky and McGinn, 2010). We
believe disciplinary unity will flow from three
practices: attending to a small number of core
problems; adopting a policy of methodological
pluralism and multimethod research; and strengthening the institutional and social fabric of the
community of scholars and practitioners in behavioral strategy.
Our vision for behavioral strategy can be summarized in the following seven points:
1. Definition: Behavioral strategy merges cognitive and social psychology with strategic
management theory and practice. Behavioral
strategy aims to bring realistic assumptions
about human cognition, emotions, and social
behavior to the strategic management of organizations and, thereby, to enrich strategy theory,
empirical research, and real-world practice.
2. We construe cognitive and social psychology
broadly. The domain of behavioral strategy
comprises three paradigms: Reductionist, Pluralist, and Contextualist. The field should embrace insights from all three paradigms.
3. Behavioral strategy should strive for greater
disciplinary unity. The field should welcome the
diversity of a three-paradigm world rather than
excluding any of them. There are three ways
to build a more unified discipline of behavioral strategy: problem integration, methodology integration, and community integration.
4. Problem integration: Behavioral strategy should
bring all three paradigms to bear on a small
number of core research problems. We propose
four core problems: (1) scaling individual cognition to collective behavior; (2) defining the
psychological underpinnings of strategy theory;
(3) understanding complex judgment in organizations; and (4) improving the psychological
architecture of the firm.
5. Methodology integration: Behavioral strategy
should adopt a principle of methodological
pluralism and intellectual sharing. Researchers
should design multimethod studies, and journal
editors and reviewers should set expectations
accordingly. Researchers should prioritize
knowledge accumulation for the field as a
whole.
Strat. Mgmt. J., 32: 1369–1386 (2011)
DOI: 10.1002/smj

<-----Page 12----->Special Issue Introduction
6. Community integration: Researchers, practitioners and others should focus on strengthening the social and institutional fabric of
behavioral strategy. Researchers should organize an interest group in the Strategic Management Society and specialized workshops and
conferences. Efforts have been made in this
direction, but much more can be done to build
name recognition, reputation, and intellectual
unity in the field. We believe the Strategic Management Society is the right venue for taking
the lead in this effort.
7. Though its three base paradigms are historically grounded and relatively stable, behavioral
strategy should strive for growth, dynamism,
and creative leadership in defining new research
problems and methods. Many changes are happening even now—the shift from decisions
to complex judgments; from individual biases
to choice architecture; from introspection to
cognitive neuroscience. We believe behavioral
strategy should stay abreast of these trends
and take leadership in exploring new research
frontiers at the intersection of strategy and
psychology.
As behavioral strategy expands and develops,
we believe the benefits of methodological pluralism will become increasingly apparent. As coeditors of the Special Issue, we reviewed papers
covering a wide range of methods: mathematical
models, simulations, brain scans, lab experiments,
field surveys, case studies, LISREL analyses, event
studies, comparative studies, discourse analyses,
cognitive mapping, and others. However, we were
surprised by how few papers tried to put these
methods together—for example, combining
experiments with event studies, simulations with
discourse analysis, or cognitive maps with brain
scanning. We see mixed-methods research as the
future of behavioral strategy. Indeed, the opportunities are so great—intellectually, socially, institutionally—that it seems inevitable that the field will
move in this direction. Opportunities for mixedmethods research have been cited earlier, and models can be found in other disciplines—for example,
the Henrich et al. (2004) program of combining
anthropology and game theory to study ultimatum
games, dictator games, and public goods games in
international cultures. We believe methodological
pluralism should become the standard for research
in behavioral strategy.

SPECIAL ISSUE: PSYCHOLOGICAL
FOUNDATIONS OF STRATEGIC
MANAGEMENT
The Call for Papers for the Special Issue was
issued in April 2008, with a submission deadline of January 20, 2009. As part of the SMS
Annual Meeting, a preconference meeting was
held in Washington, D.C., in October 2009, in
which papers still under consideration were presented and discussed.
The Call for Papers invited submissions
on a broad range of topics and using varied
methodologies:
‘We invite conceptual or empirical papers
dealing with the psychological origins of
strategy, with particular emphasis on how
psychology can inform theory and empirical research on strategy formation, resource
formation and deployment, strategy implementation, market efficiency, and sustained
competitive advantage. For empirical studies,
we welcome both conventional methods and
new or emerging methodologies, including
natural or controlled experiments, numerical or agent-based simulation, mathematical
modelling, or neuro-physiological research
such as brain scans.’
We received a very large number of submissions, more than any previous SMJ Special Issue.
The response demonstrated the scope and relevance of behavioral strategy, as well as the field’s
immense heterogeneity. There were some exceptional papers among the submissions—more than
could be published in the Special Issue. In reviewing submissions, in addition to the usual standards
of contribution, method, and style, we gave priority to papers with strong links to psychology
and papers that presented novel ideas, rather than
extensions or restatements of ideas published elsewhere. In some cases, we referred papers to the
normal SMJ review process.
We would like to express our sincere gratitude
to all those who submitted papers to the Special
Issue. We were delighted and overwhelmed by
the response, and we appreciate the patience of
authors, especially those whose papers we could
not publish. We also want to thank the many
scholars who gave generously of their time and
energies to review papers for the Special Issue.

We aimed to use three reviewers on each paper,
and we recognize that the volume of papers placed
unusual demands on our colleagues in behavioral
strategy. Finally, we are grateful for the sage
advice and support of Rich Bettis, who served as
our SMJ advising editor. Rich’s availability and
encouragement were much appreciated.
In the end, we accepted the nine papers that
appear in this volume. We believe each of them
makes a distinctive contribution to behavioral strategy. The papers cover diverse topics and methods, but also demonstrate the potential for a more
unified field of behavioral strategy. Some of the
papers use multiple methods, others point the way
to new topics and methods, and each of them
addresses one or more of the core problems in
behavioral strategy.
The paper by Huy (2011) uses social identity
theory to show how individual emotions scale to
groups and organizations and shows the consequences of collective emotions for strategy
implementation. The author’s field study in a large
Canadian service firm illustrates how a psychological mechanism such as identification can bridge
the gap between individual psychology and organizational strategy.
Dysfunctional learning regimes can lead to firm
inefficiency even when the firm and its employees do not commit cognitive errors. Markle (2011)
uses a simulation method to study this problem in the context of employees’ responses to
wage changes. The paper shows that the existence of employees who do not respond to wage
hikes causes firms to underestimate the output of
high-effort employees and, hence, to set inefficient wages. This model has many applications in
strategic management and represents a new wave
of research linking individual and organizational
learning.
Hu, Blettner, and Bettis (2011) combine reference point theory with the behavioral theory
of the firm to produce a two reference point
model of adaptive aspirations. Using simulations,
the authors examine three strategies for adjusting
aspirations—conservative, ambitious, and satisficing—and find that the latter yields better outcomes. This paper shows the benefits of combining
Reductionist and Pluralist approaches to improve
our understanding of long-standing problems in
strategic management.
Bingham and Eisenhardt (2011) conducted a
field study of organizational learning in six

entrepreneurial firms. The question concerned what
organizations learn and how they do it. The authors
argue from the data that what organizations learn
are portfolios of heuristics, and that these heuristics follow a specific developmental sequence of
events. The authors identify the heuristics and
sequences, and link them to collective learning,
memory and capability development.
Bardolet, Fox, and Lovallo (2011) combine field
evidence with experimental methods to examine
the cognitive biases of corporate resource allocation. The authors find that diversified firms show
a persistent bias toward allocating capital equally
across business units, no matter how the units
are partitioned—in effect, cross-subsidizing lowperforming units with the profits of high performers. By eliminating noncognitive explanations, the
authors reveal the psychological foundations of a
critical source of corporate inefficiency.
Two papers are linked to recent developments
in cognitive neuroscience. Powell (2011) evaluates
the prospects of behavioral neuroscience for contributing to behavioral strategy. Powell identifies
the potential contributions and limitations of neuroscience and shows how research in neurostrategy
may lead to useful interdisciplinary collaborations
and innovations in theory development, construct
validation, measurement, and strategy practice.
Hodgkinson and Healey (2011) employ a model
in social cognitive neuroscience—controlled vs.
automatic processing—to challenge the assumptions and conclusions of dynamic capability theory. The authors argue that emotion and intuition
play essential roles in building individual and collective capabilities and suggest ways of aligning
strategy theory with models of capability development in cognitive neuroscience.
We conclude the Special Issue with a commentary by Daniel Levinthal (2011) entitled ‘A
behavioral approach to strategy—what’s the alternative?’ He argues that sharp distinctions between
rational and nonrational strategy are unhelpful. The
world is neither one nor the other, and what really
matters in strategy is whether models help people solve the problems they face as scholars and
strategy practitioners. In Levinthal’s (2011) words,
‘the choice is not between whether we should act
in a God-like manner or like mortals. We are mortals.’ Ultimately, Levinthal argues, we need models
that solve the problems faced by thinking and feeling human beings, and this requires a robust and
dynamic field of behavioral strategy.
