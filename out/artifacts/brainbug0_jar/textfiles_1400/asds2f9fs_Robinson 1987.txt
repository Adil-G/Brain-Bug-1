those of thefirm’s that comprised this study. Second, they may seek to use these four strategic dimensions
as a basis on ~~~li~hthey might examine, clar&, andlor redefine the marketing strategy pursued by
their firm.
A second set of results identified three goals and priorities of venture capital$rms that have
neither changed over time nor across increasingly dtrerent strategic groups. Annualized, after-tax
return on investments of between 25% and 40% remain the most common objective across all firms.
A j-to-6 year investment time horizon and a major emphasis on the quality of the management team
in evaluating new deals were universal priorities across diverse vmnve ca&tul $rms.
A third finding in this study was that venture ca@&l jims pro&s greater “certainty” tit
the future direction of the venture capital indust~ than the d~re~t~on of their firm. The most notable
example of this is a strong sense that ~~du.~t~-wide rates of return are headed do~vnward yet few
senior partners expect theirJirm to experience this decline.
Practicing venture capitalists may be interested to peruse these results to see what trends are
predicted within the venture capital indust? by this subsample of that industry. Second, they shouid
consider the ending that ~nd~~~t~-wide rates of return are headed downward in light of the first two
sets poundings to develop their own opinion about the future performance of dtzerent strategic groups
within the industry.
It is important to note that the sample of venture capital firms on which this study was based
did not include most of the larger, olderfunds. Some of thesefunds would be characterized as “industr):
leaders, pace-setters, and innovators.” The sample provides a solid representation of the “broad
middle” of the venture capital industry and newer entrants into the industry. While larger, older funds
are under represented, their impact on future trends and strategies in the industry is captured to some
extent in the set of questions about ‘~f~ture direction of the venture capital ~ndust~l.‘~
Finally, the emerging strategic groups in the venture capitaf industry that were identified by
this study may be useful information for investors as well as users of venture capital. For investors,
the opportunity to participate in venttire capital activity should become more clear/y understood and
varied. Basica&, this study should help investors dt~erentiate the strategic posture of dl~erent venture
capital ~rrn~s and funds on four factors rather than simply i~ldu.~t~Ilgeographic ~~on.~~derution.s.
For users of venture capital, the results of this study suggest a possibility for multiple options
that are both more accessible and more cutered to speci$c needs. Users of venture capital should find
a clearer basis on which to differentiate venture capitalJrm.s in terms of venture stage priorities, staff
utilization orientations, sources and uSes of jinancial resources. This should make for more informed
“shopping” among &Jferent venture capital sources and provide a basis on which to “shop” for the
most compatible firm.

Venture capital has rapidly emerged as a definitive “industry” within the ~nancial services
sector of the U.S. economy. Prior to World War II, most venture investments came from
wealthy individuals,
families, syndicates organized by investment bankers, and a select
group of family organizations
employing professional investment managers. The 1960s
witnessed a rapid emergence of institutionalized
venture capital activity via the proliferation
of Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) brought about by the Small Business
Investment Act of 1958. Largely because of early difficulties encountered by SBICs as well
as their failure to take advantage of attractive, growing segments of the venture investment
market, the number of new private venture capital firms proliferated in the late 1960s and
early 1970s (Pratt and Morris 1984). What had been an informal, ill-defined arena of
economic activity had become a young, emerging industry.
The recession of the early 1970s presented an im~diate
test of the young pa~icipant
firms in this newly emergent industry. Success anticipated in hastily expanded investment
portfolios was frequently not forthcoming which shook the confidence of many institutional
investors. The venture capital industry regained its momentum with 1978 capital gains tax
reduction and has continued a dramatic, steady expansion. Averaging $2.5 billion in capital

commitments in 1976, the industry had reached in excess of $12 billion by 1984. What was
formerly the arena of private, informal investment activity has become a recognizable industry
with a proliferation of distinct competitors, suppliers, and users of the industry’s services.
This rapidly emerging industry has attracted the attention of numerous constituencies
acutely interested in the future “evolution” of the industry. Existing and prospective entrepreneurs, reportedly more numerous than ever before (Drucker 1984), seek to more clearly
understand the industry’s evolution in order to more easily establish effective linkages with
it. Current and prospective venture capitalists seek to gauge its evolution in order to profitably
participate. A myriad of investors seek a similar understanding to evaluate potential returns.
The federal government has taken an increased interest in understanding and facilitating its
evolution in part reflected by a recent GAO study which concluded that “the venture capital
process can greatly contribute to the nation’s economy and can significantly improve productivity in the 1980s” (U.S. GAO, 1982, p. 15). And finally, state and regional economic
development activity is looking with heightened interest on facilitating the role of the venture
capital process in new business development with the latter replacing or at least supplementing
“smoke stack chasing” as an economic development strategy.
A primary concern of venture capital research to date has been to understand the
venture capital process. The major focus in this regard has been to understand the investor,
and to a lesser extent, investee perspective in the investment decision. The other major
research focus has come at the economic impact level. This research, most recently represented by the 1982 GAO study, has sought to assess the aggregate economic impact (particularly in employment terms) of venture capital activity.
While useful in facilitating our understanding
of the venture capital process, these
research streams do not directly examine the evolution and nature of what is now the venture
capital industry. Yet with the industry becoming increasingly “institutionalized,”
an understanding of the industry’s nature and direction is essential to an effective linkage with venture
capital activity. One perspective needed in this body of research is an understanding
of
venture capital activity as an “industry.” And this understanding needs to take a futuristic
perspective, what will the industry be, rather than a strictly historical view. This article
reports on such a study.
The strategy of venture capital firms provides the central methodological focal point
in our attempt to understand the evolution of the venture capital industry. The strategy focus
requires that we consider several perspectives in order to develop a broader understanding
of the venture capital industry. First, key strategic issues/forces shaping the industry must
be identified and briefly analyzed to clarify the basic context shaping industry strategies.
Second, strategic assumptions held by industry participants regarding key trends in the
industry and key forces shaping the industry must be examined to develop a “strategic
profile” that is shaping industry participant behavior. Finally, dimension of individual firm
strategies must be identified to provide a specific picture of the strategic orientation(s) that
ultimately influence strategic behavior.
Michael Porter (1980) characterized all industries as having five basic analytical components: customers, suppliers, substitutes, threat of entrants, and competitors. The venture
capital industry is experiencing simultaneous fundamental change in each of these facets of
its industry according to the industry overview provided earlier in this book. Such a high
level of change in the growth stage of most service industries is often accompanied by
redefinition of successful strategies, the emergence of distinct “strategic groups,” and a
“shake out” of less proactive (usually smaller) firms. Will the venture capital industry be
an exception to this scenario? Probably not. So critical to understanding the evolving venture

capita1 industry is an examination of the strategies and basic strategic assumptions of current
participants in this industry. Posturing their firms to react to or take advantage of these
changes, venture capitalists must implement basic strategies for their firms that seek to
maximize their distinct competence.
Based on the fundamental changes taking place in this industry, this research sought
to assess differences among venture capital firms in five key areas which provide the foundation for venture capital strategies: 1) funding and investment, 2) emphasis on managerial
assistance, 3) factors essential to selecting new investment, 4) the influence of a portfolio
firm’s stage of development
on managerial and investment policies, and 5) differences
regarding company versus “perceived” industry assumptions about future trends in the venture
capital industry. Rather than being guided by an examination of differences between firms,
we sought to get a collective, survey-based sense of the fundamental trends in the strategic
behavior of the formal participants in the venture capital industry and, concomittantly,
an
indication of strategic priorities within individual venture capital firms.

LITERATURE REVIEW: VENTURE CAPITAL STRATEGIES
Strategic assumptions made by top management and key functional-area priorities offer two
important areas from which to gleam the strategic orientation of an enterprise (Pearce and
Robinson 1985). Research to date in the venture capital area has not focused on these issues.
Rather, three broad themes have dominated empirical research in the venture capital literature:
I) identification and analysis of the venture capital process (Bygrave and Timmons 1985;
Tyebjee and Bnmo 1984a; Timmons, Fast, and Bygrave 1983; Timmons and Gumpert 1982;
Tyebjee and Bruno 1981; Dorsey 1977; Poindexter 1976); 2) key concerns from either the
investor or investee perspective in the venture capital setting (MacMillan, Siegel, and Subba
Narasimha 1985; Bruno and Tyebjee 1984; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984a, 1984b; Tyebjee and
Bruno 1982; Charles River Associates 1976; Poindexter 1976; Hoban 1976; Wells 1974;
Diebold 1974; Hoffman 1972); and 3) macrolevel economic impact assessments or examinations of the role of venture capital in the national/international
economy (e.g., Kozmetsky,
Gill. and Smilor 1985; Sandberg 1985; Olofsson and Wahlbin 1985; Sahlman and Stevenson
1985; Fast 1982; Timmons 1981; Brophy 1981).
While most of this literature does not focus specifically on strategies, it provides some
input into our efforts to identify strategic assumptions and parameters that operate within
the venture capital industry. Five topics deserve brief reviews: 1) strategic assumptions; 2)
goals/priorities;
3) selection parameters; 4) financial strategy; and 5) technical assistance
strategy.

Strategic Assumptions
An important basis for assessing the future direction of an industry is to examine basic
assumptions participants make about key issues or trends shaping that industry (Porter 1980).
Each firm’s strategy will ultimately reflect basic assumptions about these very issues or
trends facing the industry. The literature suggest several basic issues. First, what is happening
in terms of the competitive structure of the venture capital industry (Sahlman and Stevenson
1985; Kozmetsky et al. 1985). Are the number and nature of venture capital participants
(cf. Bygrave et al. 1984; Wetzel 1984) changing significantly? Second, is the nature of the
“product~s)” provided by venture capitalists changing signi~cantly (cf. Bygraves and Timmons 1985; Bruno and Tyebjee 1983)‘~ Third, is the technology-the
process and procedure

by which venture capital firms render the product--changing
significantly (MacMillan,
Siegel, and Subba Narasimha 1985; Tyejbee and Bruno 1984a)? For example, are deal
origination, selection, and structuring activities changing (cf. MacMillan et al. 1985; Wetzel
and Wilson 1985; Tyejbee and Bruno 1984b; Bruno and Tyejbee 1983)? Finally, are any
changes taking place in the nature of the venture capital “customer?’

Goals/Priorities
The goals and priorities venture capital firms pursue offer another useful window through
which to view the intent of their strategies. Key goals and priorities suggested as important
in previous literature include capital gains, downstream public offerings, windows on technology, diversity, and new market opportunities (cf. MacMillan et al. 1985; Tyejbee and
Bruno 1984a; Timmons and Gumpert 1982; Timmons 198 1; Poindexter 1976; Hoban 1976).

Selection Parameters
Once goals and priorities are established, another key dimension of the strategy of a venture
capital firm is the criteria it employs for selecting investment (Tyejbee and Bruno 1984b).
Kozmetsky et al. (1985) suggest four areas that can be considered virtually standard for the
industry: technical, market, talent, and business planning. Tyzoon and Bruno (1984a) found
five dimensions after factor analyzing 23 evaluation criteria: market attractiveness, product
differentiation,
managerial capabilities, environmental threat resistance and cash-out potential. Earlier studies by Wells (1974) and Poindexter (1976) offer similar criteria, with “venture
stage” also emerging as important in the latter study. Venture stage has taken on added
prominence as a selection parameter in light of recent research findings which suggest an
inadequate flow of venture capital to seed and pre-start-up investments (Neiswander 1985;
Hills and Star 1985; Wetzel and Wilson 1985). Overall, it appears that skills in the management team, company/product
capability, industry considerations and stage of the venture
are key areas that reflect the strategic intent inherent in venture capital firm investment
selection priorities.

Resource Deployments
Resource deployments are key components of the strategy of any organization (Schendel
and Hofer 1978). Two key areas reflecting strategic resource commitments of increasing
importance in the venture capital industry are financial structure and management assistance
commitment (Kozmetsky et al. 1985).
The financial structure of venture capital firms is changing (Kozmetsky et al. 1985;
Bygrave and Timmons 1985). Sources of investment (equity) capital to participate in partnerships has expanded significantly since 1978. The SBIC program has expanded the role
of debt in their capital structure. The life of the typical investment may be changing with
greater variety in investment priorities (Timmons and Gumpert 1982).
The management/technical
assistance role of venture capital firms is reportedly changing (Thackray 1978). Just how venture capital firms allocate their limited yet critically skilled
staff across the venture process has become a strategic resource deployment issue (Greenthal
and Larson 1982; Inc. 1984).
In summary, the literature suggests that evolving strategies among firms in the venture
capital industry can best be studied by examining both the strategic assumptions of senior

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

Instrument
A comprehensive,
four-page survey was designed as the preferred method to obtain information about the strategic orientation of a broad sampling of venture capita1 firms. The
survey asked about the firm’s strategic assumptions,
goals/priorities,
investment selection
strategies, financial and management assistance strategies. Numerous questions were used
to examine each of these topics. These questions will be presented with the results to avoid
unnecessary duplication.
The survey was developed in three phases. First, the literature search reviewed earlier
was used to identify key dimensions which shape the strategies venture capita1 firms design
and implement.
Second, a basic structured analysis of the venture capital industry was
undertaken using Porter’s (1980) industry forces mode1 to generate a list of potential issues
shaping the industry’s future. A third survey development
activity was to discuss (via
telephone interviews) the tentative survey topics with eight venture capitalists across the
country. This step helped refine the content of the survey and enhance its “practical significant.”
The final survey included 12 “descriptive” questions and four multi-item tables within
which venture capitalists would differentiate various aspects of their strategy, tactics, and
strategic assumptions from both their firm’s perspective and their “perception” of the “industry-wide” perspective.
Reliability of the instrument was tested by correlating responses to five pairs of redundant items randomly inserted into the survey instrument. The five correlations exceeded
0.91, all significant at the 0.0001 level or greater.

Sample
The survey was sent to 140 randomly selected members of the National Venture Capital
Association and the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies. FiftyTable 1

three firms responded, representing a 37.9% response rate. Appendix 1 provides a list of
the study participants. Table 1 provides selected characteristics of the venture capital firms
in our sample. The sample had a slightly larger representation among independent venture
capital firms and northeastern firms than the nationwide venture capital population. However,
these differences were not statistically significant.
The sample did not include most of the larger, older venture capital funds in the
industry. While offered the opportunity to participate, most of these firms chose not to
respond. While their direct responses are not available, the impact of these firms on future trends and strategies in the industry was captured to some extent in the elaborate set
of questions responding firms answered about the “future direction of the venture capital
industry.”

RESULTS
Basic Assumptions About Changes in Strategic Factors or Indicators
Within the Venture Capital Industry
Tables 2 and 3 present the results from the section of the survey that examined basic
assumptions current venture capitalists have made about selected “strategic” trends in the
venture capital industry. Venture capitalists were asked to respond from both their firm’s
orientation and from what they “perceived” the overall industry perspective to be.
Table 2 reveals an overall sentiment that rates of return on investments in the venture
capital industry will decline over the next several years. It is interesting to note that most
senior partners “predict” this decline for the venture capital industry but not for their individual firms.
There was a strong consensus that the venture capital industry will see a steady increase
in:
0 competition from firms in the financial services industry,
l

size of venture capital firms,

. degree and variety of promotional

activity by VCJirms,

0 foreign capital into the U.S. venture capital market,
l

breadth and depth of managerialltechnical

l

inflation-adjusted

investment per venture.

Interestingly, the strength of agreement with these predictions was again greater from
“the industry perspective” than the individual firm’s orientation. Apparently senior partners
are either more certain about the industry’s direction than they are about their firm’s priorities
or they are unwilling to reveal the latter.
While the number of small VC firms is expected to decline, responding senior partners
expect an increase in the number of private, independent firms, and the overall number of
VC firms. A recent study by Kozmetsky, Gill, and Smilar (1985, pp. 36-38) supports this
trend with the following information on the venture capital industry between 1977 and 1983.

CAPITAL

A sentiment emerges from responding senior partners that they expect an increasing average
life for venture capital investments and greater emphasis on start-up investments. Overall,
and perhaps most interesting, Tables 2 and 3 reveal stronger opinions from venture capitalists
about trends in their industry than about the position/assumption
of their own firm on the
same factor. This preliminary finding may reflect considerable uncertainty in the strategic
decision making of current venture capital firms.

Venture Stages*
A second stage of our survey examined venture capitalists’ priorities regarding the stage of
deveIopment of the businesses in which they choose to invest.
Ninety percent of the responding senior partners indicated that part of their present
portfolio consisted of companies in the Start-Up stage (Stage I). The average portion of
their portfolios in this stage was 35.1 percent. The same number (90%) of senior partners
indicated he presence of Stage 2 (Early Growth) companies in their portfolios. The average
portion of Stage 2 companies in a venture capital firm’s portfolio was 32 percent.
Eighty percent of the responding senior partners reported that their present investment
portfolio includes one or more companies in the “Expansion” (Stage 3) stage of development.
The “average” venture capital firm had just over 30% of its investments in companies in
stage 3. Every third venture capital firm stated that one-third or more or their present portfolios
consisted of companies in this stage.

Only one in 12 senior partners reported investments in companies in a “Decline” stage.
Two (out of 53) portfolios had 10% of their investments in such companies and one had
5% in such companies.
The second portion of this “Venture Stage” section sought to differentiate the importance of specific objectives across investments at different stages. The tabulation of the
responses to this portion are presented in Table 4. Clearly, a return on investment between
25% and 40% was the overriding objective regardless of the stage of development of the
business in which the investment was made.
The next stage-related question concerned the priority of obtaining ventures in each
stage. This was examined by asking senior partners to both state general priorities for stagerelated investments and to provide specific info~ation
on the number of proposals considered
and accepted by stage of development.
Responses to the “general priorities” question are
tabulated in Table 5. Apparently venture capitalists are strongly attracted to companies in
stages one or stage two with stage three investments showing surprising strong attraction as
well.
Table 6 presents the number of proposals considered and accepted in each stage of
development by the responding venture capital firms. The average number of proposals
considered is highest for stage 1 firms (85 proposals annually), followed by an almost identical
number of stage 2 and stage 3 proposals (60 and 52, respectively). The average number of
proposals accepted (4, 2, 2, 0, 0, respectively) again reflects a slight preference for stage
1 investments followed by a solid preference for stage 2 and stage 3 investments and very
little interest in stage 4 and stage 5 investments.
The average investment in a firm by stage,
also shown in Table 6. hovers around $5~,~~
in al1 but stage 5 investments.

Three distinct, stage-related findings emerge from this section of the survey. First,
stage 1 and stage 2 businesses are the most popular investments for venture capitalists,
followed closely by stage 3 investments, particularly if the investment is around $500,000.
Second, stage 4 and stage 5 investments are not popular; and third, annualized long term
capital gains between 25% and 40% after taxes are key venture capitalist objectives regardless
of the stage of development of the investment.
Recent research reported in the Venture Capital Journal” that is provided below corroborates the findings of our study:

Financial Strategies
The study focused on three key dimensions of the financial strategy of a venture capital
firm: I) source of funds under management; 2) use of debt; and 3) nature of investments
typically made by the venture capital firm.
Perhaps the clearest way to present the results of the financial strategy question is to
start with the role of debt in the capital structure of responding venture capital firms. Twentytwo percent of the total capital structure of the average venture capital firm in our sample
consisted of debt. Since 1978, this represented an increase for only 5 firms (9% of the
sample), mainly SBICs. The figure represented a decrease use of debt by almost 60% (31
firms) of the firms we surveyed. In fact, 24 firms (45% of our sample) reported this figure
represented a drop of 10 percentage points or more in the use of debt in their capital structure.
Recent research publish~
in the Venture Capital Journal reports a rapid influx of
capital into the venture capital industry in the early 1980s (see Table 7). Independent and
corporate (industrial) venture capital firms have experienced a rapid growth of capital (304%
and 326%, respectively) since 1977. Primarily equity capital, this growth apparently outpaced
any real need for debt capital even as the number of firms grew in excess of 100% during
the same period.
How is this growth capital reflected in the nature of the venture capital firm’s equity
base? Table 8 summarizes the answers senior partners provided when asked “what percentage
of their firm’s equity base would be associated with 1 I different equity sources?’ Private
families and individuals continue to play a major role in providing venture capital. Fiftyfive percent of ail venture capital firms we surveyed derived at least part of their equity base

from private families and individuals. Thirty percent derived their equity base solely from
these sources.
Domestic financial institutions and public industrial colorations
emerged as the second
most prominent sources of equity for venture capital firms. Nine firms (17%) in our sample
were clearly venture capital subsidiaries of financial institutions while 5 firms (9% of our
sample) were similarly affiliated with large industrial corporations. This source of capital
corresponds to the areas of capital growth reported in the Venture Capital Journal’s 1984
study (see Table 7).
Pension funds and insurance companies emerged as the only other broadbase sources
of equity capital across our sample. A major difference can be seen, however, in the role
played by these two equity sources when compared with that played by private individuals,
financial institutions, and public industrial corporations. Venture capital firms using the latter
equity sources are often 100% funded by that source. Pension and insurance funded venture
capital firms virtualty never follow this pattern. Rather, the pension or insurance derived
funds are usually less than 50% of the venture capital firm’s equity bases. This fundamental

difference suggests that pension and insurance fund managers lack venture capital experience;
choosing instead, to participate in potentially attractive returns by becoming “silent money
partners” with selected, experienced venture capitalists.
The final questions relative to financial strategies sought information on the way these
funds were invested. Three characteristics were examined: 1) number of businesses invested
in; 2) amount invested; and 3) the life of the investment. Table 9 provides a summa~ of
their answers. The “average” venture capital firm typically invests $486,510 in approximately
20 ventures with an investment life of 6.3 years. But perhaps more meaningful and relevant
in Table 9 is the diversity in the investment characteristics. With the possible exception of
the life of an investment, the range in number and amount of investments is extensive. This
suggests much more diversity in investment practices, particularly with regard to amount,
among regular venture capital firms than is popularly portrayed in the business literature

Management-Assistance

Strategy

The number of venture capital “professionals”
increased by 150% between 1977 and 1983
according to the Venture Capital Journal.4 While potentially improving a “problem” associated with a scarcity of venture capital professionals,
the industry also saw the average
capital per independent firm professional increase 150% ($3.8 MM to $9.5 MM) during this
same time period. This supports our concern that staff time and client assistance are strategic
resource questions in venture capital firms.
Three dimensions of the management assistance issue were addressed in the survey
sent to senior partners in this study: 1) man-days invested per client, 2) allocation of the
firm’s total professional staff time, and 3) the industrywide trend in the breadth and depth
of management assistance.
The number of man-days invested by venture capitalists in direct managerial and/or
technical assistance per portfolio company on an annual basis ranged from zero to 4.50 mandays. Ninety percent of the senior partners responded to this question, and the average
response was 31 man-days. Over one-out-of-three
(35%) senior partners said that this represented an increase in their firm’s level of management assistance compared to 1980. Only
two senior partners said that their level of management
assistance had decreased. Fifty
percent of all senior partners said that the amount of time invested in direct managerial and/
or technical assistance by their staff has “remained unchanged” since 1980.
All but one senior partner responded that their hrms spend professional staff time
devoted to on-going managerial/technical
needs of existing portfolio companies. The percentage of total staff time allocated to managerial/technical
assistance ranged from 5 to 80%.

The average annual amount of staff time allocated to managerial assistance was 35% of the
total staff time available during a given year. Table 10 provides an overall breakdown of
time allocation responses.
There was a strong sentiment among responding senior partners that the “breadth and
depth” of managerial/technical
assistance provided by venture capital firms to their portfolio
companies would steadily increase across the industry as a whole. Once again, the sentiment
was stronger that the “industry” would increasingly move in this direction than was the
indication regarding their specific firms.
A recent study’ provided by the Venture Cupiraf Journal sheds additional light on this
management assistance trend. First, the number of “professionals”
in venture capital has
increased by 150% (from 597 to 1494 professionals) between 1977 and 1983. While on the
surface this represents greater ability to render assistance, part of this increase is associated
with new firms joining the industry (an 89% rise between 1977 and 1983). Furthermore,
the average capital per firm and average capital per professional have increased 15.5% (to
$27 MM) and 93% (to $8.1 MM), respectively. This indicates that the increased staff-time
available was hardly more than sufficient to cover basic oversight responsibilities associated
with a substantial increase in financial commitments across a growing number of venture
capital firms.

Factors Of Importance In Evaluating New Investments
This final section of the survey asked senior partners to rank factors in relation to their
importance to the venture capitalists’ decision to invest in a company or person. The question
divided the potential factors into those which relate directly to the investee company, its
product, and environment; and those which relate directly to the entrepreneur or management
of the company. Senior partners were asked to rank these factors on a five point scale that
ranged from “very unimportant” to “very important.”
Two procedures were employed to examine the responses of the 53 senior partners:
1) ranking of mean importance scores and 2) varimax rotated factor analysis. Comparison
of mean importance scores yielded four groups based on responses from the 53 venture
capitalists (see Table 11). The groups could best be characterized as critical, important,
somewhat important and unimportant. There were three “critical” factors all associated with
the key individual(s): personal motivation, organization skills, and executive experience.
The next group, characterized as “important,”
incfuded three factors associated with the
prospective company and its technical “fit”: su~sta~tjal growth objectives, in a growth
indust~, by a complete management team with sufficient technical skills. The next grouping,
best characterized as “somewhat important,” contained three factors associated with the
individual entrepreneur(s):
interpersonal
skills, technical job experience, and to a lesser
extent, references supplied by the entrepreneur(s).
A final group of five factors, often cited
in the literature as important in the venture capital decision, proved unimportant to the senior
partners in our study: profitable track record, managerial assistance needs, minimum future
funding requirements,
five year investment liquidity and competitor’s evaluation of the
entrepreneur.
The factor analysis procedure provided tindings that expand and in some ways contradict the mean rankings. The results of the factor analysis are provided in Table i 1. The
factor analysis suggests that venture capitalists have five different concerns when evaluating

new deals. Most important is the composition of the venture team. Venture capitalists are
looking for a complete management team that possesses managerial skills which are experience based. The second major concern for venture capitalists appears to be the match
between technical skills/experience
of the key players and requirements of the particular
industry. The third concern (Factor No. 3) suggests venture capitalists seek to balance
resource needs of the venture with the motivation and interpersonal skill of the entrepreneur(s). This factor’s loadings appear to be saying “once I can substantiate growth objectives
and management assistance/funding
needs, does this person or team have the personal
motivation to make it work and the interpersonal skills to make it worthwhile.” The company’s profitability to date and references supplied by the entrepreneur(s) are considerably
less important in deal evaluations according to the factor analysis.

DISCUSSION
The venture capital industry has entered a phase of substantial growth. Far from a temporary
spurt, this new developmental phase of the venture capital industry is associated with fundamental changes in several economic and societal factors having major implications for
the provision of and need for venture capital.
Probable life experience scenarios for “baby boomers” suggest an unprecedented,
broad-based demand for venture capita1 services. At the same time, that demand will come
from potential entrepreneurs with higher levels of education and expectation, a predominant
service industry orientation, lower investment requirements, and greater demands for control
of their enterprise while simultaneously
demanding greater levels of managerial assistance
than venture capitalists have been accustomed to with previous “customers.”
The financial services industry, in the midst of a virtual revolution brought on by
deregulation and the baby boom’s maturation, is rapidly moving from the role of a supplier
of funds to venture capitalists into the role of active participant in the venture capital industry.
This forward integration, given the volume of funds controlled by or available to the financial
service businesses, may alter the nature of venture capitalism. Concurrent with these developments, the fundamental revolution in the technological foundations of our economy
suggests that the focus of investment for growth will change radically over the next decade.
The government/regulatory
influence on the interaction of these emerging forces is a
big question mark. Recent tax changes have temporarily improved the capita1 gains picture,
but this could change. Twenty states have adopted “entrepreneurial
development” strategies
as the focal point of their economic development policies. Depending upon eventual initiatives created to implement this policy, venture capitalists may (or may not) find a more
favorable govemmentaliregulatory
environment.
Unfortunately,
an initial predominance of
debt-oriented programs rather than equity-oriented
policies is not really in the best interest
of venture capitalists.
Michael Porter (1980) characterized all industries as having five basic analytical components: customers, suppliers, substitutes, threat of entrants, and competitors. The venture
capital industry is experiencing simultaneous fundamental change in each of these facets of
its industry according to our macroeconomic
analysis. Such a high level of change in the
growth stage of most service industries has been accompanied by redefinition of successful
strategies, the emergence of distinct “strategic groups,” and a “shake out” of less proactive
(usually smaller) firms. Our analysis suggests the venture capital industry will not be an
exception to this scenario.
A limited set of findings argue that the venture capital industry, rather than separating

<-----Page 19----->72

into distinct groups, will remain rather homogenous. For example, the universal consistency
in the nature of basic goals and priorities across a diverse set of venture capital firms indicates
that they’re all after the same thing: 25%-40% annualized returns or five times their investment in five years. Second, the fact that two of the Iargest sources of new investment
capital-pension
funds and financial service corporations-are
initially entering the industry
via minority positions in existing venture capital firms reinforces the present priorities and
indeed the present composition of the primary venture capital network. In other words,
instead of entering as direct competitors, these sizable funds are choosing to participate in
a much more passive, limited partnership role. These interpretations
are consistent across
both this survey and recent research by Kozmetsky et al. ( 1985).
While unifo~ investment ob.jectives and passive investment behavior by pension funds
and financial service companies may suggest maintenance of the venture capital industry’s
status quo, there is considerable evidence in the survey results to suggest otherwise. First,
there was wide variability in the strategies firms used to deploy a key resource-professional
staff. Some firms emphasized extensive management/technical
assistance, providing almost
two staff professionals,
the equivalent of one year to their “average” business while others
invested only one person for two-to-five days per year in an “average” business. This variation
in “staff utilization strategies” is further reinforced by the range of answers to the percentage
of allocation of staff time question. Kozmetsky et al. (1985) reported a sizeable industrywide increase in profession staff although it varied by type of firm and, perhaps more telling,
did not rise as fast as the amount of money being invested. Both studies suggest that industry
is segmenting on the staff utilization dimension-ranging
from firms offering intensive
management assistance to firms offering minimal management assistance.
A second survey area that supports the emergence of several distinct groupings across
venture capital firms were the results concerning financial strategies. Again, there was wide
variability, this time in terms of how venture capital firms obtained and deployed financial
resources. Both this survey and the Kozmetsky et al. (1985) study found equity capital into
the venture capital industry growing at an unprecedented rate. The flexibility this allows,
seen initially by the overall dramatic drop in the use of debt, could have a far-reaching
impact in facilitating the “freedom” for participating firms to focus on distinct niches in the
demand for venture capital. Traditionally
seen in industry and geographic terms, this survey suggests that specialization
in terms of size of investments,
stage of investments,
clients served (e.g., entrepreneur versus investment intermediary),
and amount of capital
under management are some of the more prominent ways firms are seeking to differentiate
themselves.
Recent innovations in ways to provide “capital” for new ventures that were not measured in our survey reinforce this differentiation
trend. Specifically, there appears to be an
increase in corporate venture capital tied to contracts and/or technology transfer. These
approaches tend to set higher prices on equity than pure venture capital deals because of
both the difficulty in establishing their true value and the low relative “cost” to the corporate
provider. They also expand the “equity” options available to the investee, again raising the
competition for pure venture capital. The net effect on traditional venture capital firms may
be to increase the need to increase the flexibility in their capital structure, which is consistent
with the financial structure trends our study uncovered.
The venture stage rest&s of our analysis generally reinforce the anticipated emergence
of widespread differentiation
within venture capital indust~. The “average” venture capital
firm has fairly equal commitments across stage 1, 2, and 3 investments. Its future plans call

for similar diversity. But the balance in the range of commitments
across stages varies
considerably across firms, an indication of emerging specialization across stage of development. One trend emerging in our survey and suggested in earlier studies (Kozmetsky et
al. 1985, p. 42) is an overall increase in second stage and latter stage financings accompanied
by a slight decline in start-up financing. This trend is most strongly found among larger
firms and financial institution funded firms.
Somewhat contrary to these findings, popular business magazines (e.g., INC.; VENTURE) have noted an increase in the number of new funds in “seed’‘-very
early stagefinancing. Just a few firms in our study indicated a predominant stage 1 (some “seed”
investments) orientation. Kozmetsky et al. (198.5, p. 42) reported a slight increase in seed
financing from 4% to 6% of industry activity from 1981 to 1983. While not a major arena
of industry activity, this nonetheless is of sufficient size to constitute an emerging “niche”
or way some funds are choosing to specialize.
The priorities senior partners in our study apply to deal evaluation differ very little
from those reported in recent studies by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984a, 1984b). The management
team’s skill and experience was the strongest priority among the partners we surveyed,
followed closely by the need to document a sound match between industry/market
growth
opportunities and the technical skills unique to the venture. Tyebjee and Bruno (1984a,
198413) found very similar priorities but a reverse ordering. Overall these results suggest
that an increasingly differentiated venture capital industry will remain virtually uniform in
their fundamental deal evaluation criteria.
Perhaps one of the most interesting findings in this survey emerges out of the answers
to the questions regarding basic “strategic assumptions” about the direction of the industry.
These questions were asked twice: I) where is the industry heading on about 20 strategic
issues, and 2) where is your firm headed on the same issues. Throughout these answers
there was greater certainty about where the industry was headed than where their individual
firm was headed. Several interpretations apply. The senior partners might gladly offer an
opinion about the industry but withhold commitment about their intentions. This seems
unlikely, however, given their open answers to all the other strategy questions. Much more
likely is that they share a general sense of key trends in the industry, but are undecided
about their firm’s relationship with or commitment to that trend.
Their incremental efforts at differentiating their firms are taking them gradually away
from what they perceive to be an overall, unified industry direction. This may well reflect
underlying unce~ainty, given that “the industry” is inhabited by firms that are rapidly and
pervasively differentiating
the nature of their venture capital services. The overall survey
results reinforce this apparent uncertainty. While several changes are taking place in components of the strategies of venture capital firms, the overall characterization of these ftrms
strategies is one of uncertainty and reaction. Fundamental change in strategy is suggested
by expanding funding sources, broader participation at different stages of development of
portfolio companies, and disagreement on the part of responding firms with the series of
statements believed to “characterize” the industry based on various business and economic
literature. At the same time, an uncertain and reactive posture is seen through several of
our findings. While there was a strong sentiment that managerial assistance would become
an increasingly important strategy component in the 198Os, there was a significantly lower
conviction within each firm that it either did or did not share this orientation. Likewise, two
pages of statements (in our survey) reflecting strategic assumptions and competitive methods
found pervasively stronger commitment on their “increasing” or “decreasing” role from an

<-----Page 21----->74

industry perspective than from the individual firm’s perspective. Again raising a contradiction, a macroeconomic
analysis suggests a broad, baby-boom supported customer base
offering somewhat riskier, smaller investments in “stage 1” ventures. Responding firms,
except those with predominantly
institutional funding, appear headed for increasing stage 3
and stage 2 concentration at higher levels of investment per venture. This may clearly provide
the broad, underserved customer base large financial service firms will look for to build
dominant positions in the emerging venture capital industry. Perhaps reflecting the uncertainty
or inconsistency in current venture capital strategies, the growing emphasis on stage 3 and
stage 2 firms was accompanied
by a significantly
higher emphasis on personal factors
associated with the entrepreneur in evaluating potential investments than factors associated
with the company and its industry. This suggests that many current venture capital firms
feel most comfortable using factors critical to the success of stage 1 firms in their evaluation
of stage 2 and stage 3 applicants-another
contradiction.
Perhaps the most telling contradiction was that most firms saw industry returns as declining, but virtually no firm expected
that to happen in their case.
The importance of the apparent contradictions and uncertainties is less in their specifics
and more in their overall meaning. The overall “certainty;” about the industry is really
anchored in long-standing fundamentals: return rates, investment life, and evaluation priorities. Individual firm uncertainty (about fit with the industry) may well reflect their growing
departure from a uniform model of the industry’s typical participant. Since their other
responses suggest a “uniform” model is most likely out-of-date, these contradictions
and
uncertainties become yet another source of evidence that multiple strategic groups (or industry
segments) are emerging in a maturing, restructuring venture capital industry.
What form will those strategic groups take? Our study suggests several dimensions
on which groups will differentiate: I) High-to-low levels of staff assistance; 2) size of financial
investment; 3) stage of venture; 4) the sources of equity capital; and 5) level of vertical
integration in the generation-to-management
of investments chain. Further research is needed
to more clearly identify the emerging characteristics of these strategic groups and the specific
strategies they will follow.
The absence of certain types of venture capital firms in our sample suggests that certain
strategic groups may not be fully characterized by our study. The lack of a thorough
representation of the larger, older venture capital funds within our sample suggests that a
key strategic group has not been fully identified in the results of our study except in the
context of general opinions about overall industry direction offered by the firms that responded. The strategic behavior of this important industry group deserves similar attention
in future research.
The emerging strategic groups that were identified in this study represent opportunities
for investors, venture capital firms, and users of venture capital. For investors, the opportunity
to participate in venture capital activity should become more clearly understood and varied.
For users of venture capital, the conditions suggest a possibility for multiple options that
are both more accessible and acutely catered to specific needs. For venture capital firms,
the scenario presents formidable challenges and opportunities. The opportunities are centered
around specialization, building and creating a unique presence, and possible synergy between
increasingly specialized industry participants. The challenges are associated with a requirement to implement strategies specifically targeted to unique industry segments. The expectation that overall rates of return will decline, while no firm individually expects it will
experience such a decline, speaks to the challenge associated with designing strategic groupcompetitive strategies.
