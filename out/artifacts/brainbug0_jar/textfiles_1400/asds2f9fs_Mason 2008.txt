<-----Page 1----->THE REAL VENTURE CAPITALISTS: A REVIEW
OF RESEARCH ON BUSINESS ANGELS
Colin M Mason

ABSTRACT
Business angels are high net worth individuals who invest their own money, along
with their time and expertise, in unquoted companies in which they have no family
connection in the hope of financial gain. They are a distinctive source of finance for
entrepreneurial businesses, making significantly more seed, start-up and early stage
investments than venture capital funds. Governments are now increasingly targeting
business angels as a means of increasing the supply of early stage venture capital. It is
therefore puzzling why angel investing has attracted less attention from scholars than
its significance deserves. This paper starts by making the case why entrepreneurship
scholars should devote more attention to angel investing. It then reviews the research
that has been undertaken on business angels and their investment activity since the
seminal work of William Wetzel jr. published in 1981. The review covers definitional
and measurement issues, angel profiles, the investment process (deal flow, screening
and evaluation, negotiating and contracting, and post-investment relationships) and
the evolution of the market. The paper concludes by suggesting priority areas for
future research on the topic.

<-----Page 2----->1. INTRODUCTION
Despite the scholarly attention that is given to the venture capital industry, the reality
is that business angels are the most significant source of risk capital for new and
young entrepreneurial businesses. Indeed, financing trends in Silicon Valley (and
elsewhere) indicate that the significance of business angels is increasing. For example,
Foremski (2008) notes that “venture capitalists … have outsourced much of the seed
investing to angels. The angel investors are now a more important generator of the
next wave of start-ups than ever before” Mitra (2008), in a Forbes article, describes
angels as being “the real venture capitalists of Silicon Valley”.

Business angels can be defined as high net worth individuals who invest their own
money, along with their time and expertise, directly in unquoted companies in which
they have no family connection, in the hope of financial gain1 (Mason, 2006a). They
are a distinctive source of finance, distinguishable from both ‘love money’ (family
and friends) and venture capital funds and from other forms of personal investing.
First, in contrast to venture capital funds, angels are investing their own money.
Second, unlike other forms of personal investing, business angels are investing in
unquoted companies. Third, unlike pooled investment vehicles, angels are making
their own decisions about which businesses to invest in. Fourth, in contrast to
investments by family and friends, angel investing involves seeking commercial
returns. US research has established that ‘typical’ business angels may be motivated
in part by non-financial considerations (‘hot buttons’) and may even be willing to
trade-off such considerations against a lower financial return (Wetzel, 1981; Sullivan,

2

<-----Page 3----->1994). Nevertheless, such investors still regard these investments as being
commercially-oriented. Finally, angel investing is ‘smart money’. Business angels are
hands-on investors, contributing their skills, experience, knowledge and contacts in
the businesses in which they invest. Here again, this contrasts with investments by
family and friends which is ‘dumb money’.

There are several reasons why angel investing is critical to the maintenance of an
entrepreneurial economy. First, is its scale. Gaston (1989a; 229) estimated that the
investment activity of business angels in the USA “is more than double the next
largest external equity source and eight times larger than professional venture capital
commitments.” A more recent estimate by Sohl (2003: 37) “suggests that between
300,000 and 350,000 angels are investing approximately $30 billion every year in
close to 50,000 ventures. “ By way of contrast, “venture capital funds invest between
$30 and $35 billion annually in entrepreneurial ventures and bankroll less than 3000
companies.” In the case of the UK, where angel activity is only half that of the USA,
Mason and Harrison (2000a: 144) have estimated that business angels “make nearly
eight times as many investments as venture capital funds in early stage businesses.”
Moreover, business angels are often critical in enabling companies to access venture
capital in the future, making an initial investment and helping a young company to
develop to the stage where it can attract venture capital funds. For example, 57% of
technology firms in Ottawa which had received funding from angels went on to raise
institutional venture capital, compared with only 10% of firms which did not raise any
angel investment (Madill et al, 2005).

3

<-----Page 4----->The significance of business angels in the entrepreneurial process is reinforced by
their hands-on investment style. They typically invest in industries and markets in
which they are familiar. Indeed, they derive considerable satisfaction (psychic
income) from this involvement and for many it is a significant reason for investing in
unquoted companies. As a consequence, the entrepreneurs who are funded by
business angels derive considerable value from the expertise, knowledge and
experience that their investors pass on through their hands-on involvement. Indeed,
entrepreneurs often report that the hands-on involvement of business angels is more
valuable than the capital that they have received. Demand-side studies indicate that
many entrepreneurs are seeking ‘smart money’ and for this reason business angels are
valued ahead of other funding sources (Cressy and Olofsson, 1997; Lindström and
Olofsson, 2001; Sætre, 2003).

Finally, in many regions business angels are the only source of risk capital (Gaston,
1989b). Investments by venture capital funds are geographically concentrated (Mason,
2007), whereas “angels live everywhere” (Gaston, 1990: 273). Gaston’s research
suggests that the proportion of business angels in the US adult population is fairly
constant at around four angels in every 1000 adults. Certainly, research has
documented the presence of business angels in various economically lagging regions
such as Atlantic Canada (Feeney et al, 1998; Farrell, 1998; Johnstone, 2001) where
institutional sources of venture capital are largely absent.2 Moreover, angels make the
majority of investments locally (and as a consequence is an important mechanism for
retaining and recycling wealth within the region that it was created). This reflects both
the localised nature of their business and personal networks through which they

4

<-----Page 5----->identify most of their investments and their hands-on investment style and consequent
need for frequent contact with their investee businesses.

Given all of this, it is puzzling that venture capital has attracted so much attention
from scholars and features so prominently in entrepreneurship text books and course
syllabuses when it is only available to a small minority of elite businesses. The paper
reviews the literature on angel investing. Its origins go back to the seminal work of
Wetzel (1981; 1983) in the early 1980s, although Wetzel (1986) acknowledges some
even earlier work. Wetzel’s work attracted replication both in the USA and
internationally – what Mason and Harrison (2000b) termed ‘first generation studies’.
More recent work – second generation studies – has extended research in new
directions, primarily by drilling down into specific aspects of the investment process.
The aim is to establish what we know about angel investing and identify where further
research could usefully be directed. Some of the seminal studies have prompted
national and regional/state governments to target business angels as a means of
increasing the supply of early stage risk capital. This has generated an applied
literature on public policy efforts to promote angel investing. However, this literature
is excluded from this review for length considerations.3 The review starts by
considering issues of definition, identification and measurement. It then covers
business angel profiles (section 3), the investment process (section 4) and the
evolution of the angel market (section 5). The concluding section suggests priority
areas for future research on the topic.

5

<-----Page 6----->2. DEFINITIONAL AND MEASUREMENT ISSUES
One of the biggest obstacles to research on business angels is their invisibility and
desire for privacy and the private and undocumented nature of their investing. Unlike
the institutional venture capital market, there are no lists or directories of business
angels. As a result, as Wetzel (1983: 26) observed, the total population of business
angels “is unknown and probably unknowable.” Two consequences follow. First, at
the macro scale it has not been possible to accurately measure the number of business
angels or their investment activity on either a cross-sectional (static) or time-series
basis. Second, micro scale research on business angels has had to identify business
angels through a variety of imperfect sources with no way in which to test for the
‘representativeness’ of the samples that have been generated. Indeed, many studies
have been based on ‘samples of convenience’, such as angels who are members of
business angel networks4, or snowball sampling methods, both of which are likely to
generate biased samples. The difficulty of finding business angels has also meant that
most samples are small, which adds to the representativeness problem. However,
progress is now being made with data sources that offer the promise of enabling much
more accurate estimates of the population to be made (e.g. Avdeitchikova et al (2008),
Farrell et al (2008), Riding, 2008).

The skewed nature of the business angel population further compounds the problems
of generating representative samples of business angels. This skewness has two
dimensions. First, the size distribution of investments (whether by angel or per
transaction) is positively skewed: there are lots of small investments and small
investors but relatively few large investments and angels who have invested large
amounts. However, the relatively small number of large investments and major angels

6

<-----Page 7----->make a disproportionate contribution to total investment activity. Second, the
frequency of investing is also positively skewed. Most angels have made relatively
few investments (less than five) but there is a minority of much more active investors
(‘super angels’) who have a disproportionate effect on overall market activity.
Particular data sources may be biased to particular ends of the distribution. For
example, business angels who are members of business angel networks may be biased
towards the left-hand of the distribution – small and infrequent investors.5

The problem of identifying business angels and measuring their investment activity is
compounded by definitional imprecision. In the past the terms ‘angel investing’,
‘informal venture capital’ and ‘informal investing’ were regarded as being
synonymous. However, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) has complicated
matters by defining ‘informal investment’ as comprising all forms non-institutional
risk capital investments in unquoted businesses – in other words including
investments made by family, friends and business angels in the same category
(Bygrave et al, 2003; Maula et al, 2005). However, as emphasised at the outset,
business angel investment is conceptually distinct from ‘love money’ invested by
family members because of its commercial orientation. Moreover, it is axiomatic that
access to finance from family members is constrained by ties of blood and marriage,
and so it is only available to other family members. Accordingly, it does not constitute
a market.

A second definitional issue is that the population of business angels is not fixed or
static. Several studies have identified a significant minority of ‘virgin’ angels who are
actively looking to make their first investment. Another problematic category are

7

<-----Page 8----->‘non-active investors’: individuals who have made one or more investments but are
not currently looking to make new investments, either because they have no further
liquidity (but may become active investors again once they realise proceedings from a
successful exit event) or because they have now withdrawn from the market. Angel
investing involves a lot of opportunism, as Atkin and Eseri (1993) suggest, thus, there
is a further category of latent investors – individuals who would not describe
themselves as active investors but who will investment opportunistically if suitable
deals ‘pop up’. Including any of these categories risks exaggerating the population of
business angels.

Recent research has added further confusion by suggesting that angel investors are not
a homogeneous group. For example, Gaston (1989b) identifies ten distinct types of
business angel. Coveney and Moore (1998) identify three types of business angel
based on their level of entrepreneurial activity and intensity of investment activity:
‘entrepreneur’ angels, ‘wealth maximizing’ angels and ‘income seeking’ angels.
Sørheim and Landström (2001) propose a four-fold categorisation based on the level
of investment activity and investment competence (measured by entrepreneurial
experience). Infometrics Ltd (2004) have suggested that angels are differentiated on
two dimensions – motivation (guardian, professional, operational expertise, financial
return) and activity (dabblers vs. active). Avdeitchikova (2008) has proposed a fourfold classification of angels according to their the post-investment roles. This is based
around two dimensions – their contribution of financial resources and their
contribution of non-financial resources.

8

<-----Page 9----->Finally, the evolution of the angel market, notably with the creation of angel
syndicates and other angel groups (Sohl, 2007), has created further definitional
confusion. These groups operate in two ways. First, they may act as formal or
informal syndicates in which each member of the syndicate takes an active role in the
investment opportunity identification, screening and investment processes. Typically
such syndicates will by relatively small. Second, they may operate on the basis of a
small group of active investors offering passive members of group the opportunity to
invest in deals that they are offered but had no role in identifying, evaluating or
negotiating and will not play any hands on role in the investee businesses. This second
group might be considered to have broken some aspects in the conventional definition
of a business angel. Nevertheless, as they are investing their own money on a deal-bydeal basis and making a basic investment decision (yes or no). Rather more
problematic are those angels groups which operate on the basis of pooling their
investment funds and devolving the investment decisions to the syndicate leaders.

The reality of angel investing is therefore that it operates on a spectrum, occupied at
one end by the solo investor who makes his or her own investment decision to invest
directly, and at the other end investors who are part of angel syndicates who simply
say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the investment opportunities that they are offered and play no
hands-on role in the investee company. The hands-off investor who invests in a
pooled fund and delegates the decision on which investments to make would not be
considered to be a business angel on the basis on the definition adopted here.

9

<-----Page 10----->3. BUSINESS ANGEL PROFILES
Research on angel investing has largely focused on Western developed economies
(USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand). However, it is important to
emphasise that it is a global phenomenon, with business angels also identified and
profiled in Japan (Tashiro, 1999), Singapore (Hindle and Lee, 2000), China (Tuingehi
and Chang, 2007) and South America (Pereiro, 2002; Amorós et al, 2009). One of the
striking features in the literature is the remarkable consistency in the characteristics of
business angels across countries. Only in Asia does it appear that angels have a
distinctively different profile (Tashiro, 1999). For example, Wong and Po (2007)
suggest that angel investing in Singapore is driven to a greater extent than in Europe
by friendship ties.

The profile of the typical business angel is characterised as follows.

Male. Studies in various countries are consistent in finding that upwards of 95% of
business angels are male. This can be attributed to the relatively small numbers of
women who have built successful entrepreneurial companies or hold senior positions
in large companies. However, the small minority of women who are business angels
have similar characteristics to those of their male counterparts (Harrison and Mason,
2007).

In the 45-65 year age group. This reflects the length of time required to build
significant personal net worth, the greater amount of discretionary wealth of this age
group as their children cease to become financially dependent on them, and the age at
which people with a successful business career might chose, or be forced to,

10

<-----Page 11----->disengage. Becoming a business angel is often a way in which such individuals to
remain economically active. For example, cashed out entrepreneurs in their 40s or 50s
often report that they became business angels because they quickly became bored by a
life of leisure. As one angel noted, “the attractions of playing golf seven days a week
quickly palls.” There are some international differences. Angels are slightly younger
in the USA and slightly older in Nordic countries (Landström, 1993). Recent studies
hint that business angels may be becoming slightly younger (e.g. Infometrics, 2004).
This may be linked, at least in part, to the acquisition frenzy of the closing years of the
technology boom of the late 1990s which enabled a lot of younger entrepreneurs to
cash-out.

Successful cashed-out entrepreneurs. Most business angels have had experience of
business start-up and growth. As Freear et al (1992: 379) note, this implies that many
angels “have acquired the kind of experience … that it takes to start, manage and
harvest a successful entrepreneurial venture. In a sense their entire professional
careers have prepared them to conduct the due diligence necessary to evaluate the
merits and risks of prospective investments and to add value of their know how to the
ventures they bankroll.” The remainder are typically either people who have held
senior positions in large companies or have specialist commercial skills and are
involved in working with entrepreneurial companies (e.g. accountants, consultants,
lawyers) and whose wealth is derived from high income. However, the composition of
business angels does vary between places. For example, Paul et al (2003) note that the
proportion of angels in Scotland with entrepreneurial backgrounds is lower than
reported for other counties, which is consistent with its lower level of entrepreneurial
activity. It is also important to emphasise that non-business professionals (e.g.

11

<-----Page 12----->doctors, dentists) and public sector employees are conspicuous by their absence from
the ranks of business angels (Gaston, 1989b).

However, as noted earlier, this profile masks considerable heterogeneity in the
business angel population, not so much in terms of their demographics but rather in
their motivation and investment focus. This has prompted some scholars to focus on
specific types of business angel. Kelly and Hay (1996; 2000) have focused on the
most active investors who account for a disproportionate amount of investment
activity. They note that such angels are more financially driven and formalised in
their approach, which they suggest reflects their experience of living through
unforeseen problems and obstacles. Visser and Williams (2001) examine “takeover
and turnaround artists” – business angels who specialise in investing in distressed
companies with the aim of turning them around to start on a growth path again.6 As
they note, these investors are “performing the same function as … other types of
business angels … – breathing new life into a business – but at the other end of the
business spectrum – when the business is about to die” (Visser and Williams, 2001:
2). Finally, there are signs of growing interest in women business angels and why they
are under-represented in the business angel population (Harrison and Mason, 2007;
Sohl and Hill, 2007; Kauffman Foundation, 2006).

There have been surprisingly few attempts to compare business angels with noninvestors. Lindsay (2004) finds that angels score more highly on measures of
entrepreneurial orientation – pro-activeness, innovativeness, risk-taking strategies –
which, in turn, suggests that they act in an entrepreneurial manner in undertaking their
investment activities. However, this might simply reflect the entrepreneurial

12

<-----Page 13----->background of most business angels. Duxbury et al (1996) suggest that angels are
distinctive from non-investors in terms of their psychological traits, with an internal
locus of control, very high need for achievement (nAch), a moderately high need for
affiliation and autonomy and are intrinsically motivated. But here again, these are also
entrepreneurial traits.

4. THE INVESTMENT PROCESS
The aim of the early studies of the informal venture capital market was, in the words
of William Wetzel jr, the pioneer of the field, “to put boundaries on our ignorance”
(Wetzel, 1986: 132) by generating insights into the characteristics of business angels
and their investment activity. By contrast, what Mason and Harrison (2000b) have
termed ‘second generation studies’ have focused on how the investment process
works. Following Riding et al (1993) and Haines et al (2003) a number of discrete
stages can be identified:
•

Deal origination

•

Deal evaluation: this can, in turn, be sub-divided at least two sub-stages:
o initial screening
o detailed investigation

•

Negotiation and contracting

•

Post-investment involvement

•

Harvesting

This sequence is similar, at least in outline, to the investment decision-making model
of institutional venture capital funds (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Fried and Hisrich,
1994). However, the approach of business angels is typically less sophisticated and
they perform less due diligence than venture capital fund managers (Van Osnabrugge

13

<-----Page 14----->and Robinson, 2000). Moreover, although the approach is depicted as proceeding in a
linear, step-wise manner, in practice there may be feedback and looping and the
skipping or merging of stages (Van Osnabrugge, 2000).

Agency theory provides a framework to study the investment process. An agency
relationship is said to exist when one individual (the principal) engages the services of
another individual (the agent) to perform a service on their behalf (Jensen and
Meckling, 1976). This involves the delegation of a measure of decision-making
authority from the principal to the agent. Both are assumed to be economicmaximising individuals. The central concern of agency theory is opportunism. The
separation of ownership and control creates the risk that the agent will make decisions
that are not in the best interests of the principal. This creates two types of risk for the
principal (i.e. the investor). The first is adverse selection which arises as a result of
informational asymmetries: the agent is better informed than the principal about their
true level of ability. However, agents may deliberately misrepresent their abilities to
the principal. The second risk is moral hazard. In situations where it is not possible for
the principal to observe the behaviour of agents the agent may shirk, engage in
opportunistic behaviour that is not in the interests of the principal or pursue divergent
interests that maximise their economic interests rather than those of the principal. Fiet
(1995) argues that every investment decision also includes market risk - the risk that
the business will perform less well than anticipated on account of competitive
conditions (e.g. competition, demand, technological change). This section considers
how business angels manage these sources of risk.

14

<-----Page 15----->4.1 Deal Origination
The evidence is consistent in suggesting that business angels adopt a relatively ad hoc
and unscientific approach to identifying investment opportunities. Atkin and Esiri
(1993) emphasise that most investments arise from chance encounters. Informal
personal contacts – business associates and friends – are the most significant sources
of deal flow. Professional contacts are much less significant: of these, accountants are
the most frequent sources whereas few business angels receive deal flow from
lawyers, bankers and stockbrokers. Those angels who are known in their communities
also receive approaches from entrepreneurs. Information in the media is another
source of deal flow for a significant minority of business angels. Some business
angels also undertake their own searches for investment opportunities. In some cases
– especially in the case of ad hoc investors - the entrepreneur is not a stranger but a
business associate who is known to the angel (e.g. client, supplier) (Atkin and Esiri,
1993). Kelly and Hay (2000) observe that the most active investors have less reliance
than occasional investors on ‘public’ sources (e.g. business angel networks,
accountants, lawyers, etc) for their deal flow and place more emphasis on ‘private’
sources. Thus, angels receive most of their deals through referrals from individual and
institutional sources in their extensive and longstanding networks of relationships.

However, these various sources of information differ in their effectiveness. Freear et
al (1994) have calculated yield rates for various sources of deal flow (i.e. comparing
investments made against deals referred for each information source). This points to
the informal personal sources of information - business associates, friends and
approaches from entrepreneurs – as the ones that have the highest probability of
leading to investments whereas non-personal sources such as accountants, lawyers

15

<-----Page 16----->and banks have a low likelihood of generating investments. Riding et al (1995) find
that the rejection rate at the initial screening stage for deals referred by business
associates is lower than that for other referral sources. These findings are largely
corroborated by Mason and Harrison (1994) for the UK. This and other studies have
also noted the low yield ratio for business angel networks (Mason and Harrison,
1996a; 1999, 2002a).

Investing in businesses that are referred by trusted business associates and friends is
an obvious way in which business angels can minimise adverse selection problems.
As Riding et al (1995) comment, “even if the principals of the firm are unknown to
the investors, if the investor knows and trusts the referral source risk is reduced.” Deal
referrers are passing judgement on the merits of the opportunity and so are putting
their own credibility and reputation on the line.

4.2 Deal evaluation
The process of evaluating investment opportunities involves at least two distinct
stages – initial screening and detailed investigation (or due diligence) (Riding et al,
1993) – although most studies do not make this important distinction. The initial step
of business angels is to assess investment opportunities for their ‘fit’ with their own
personal investment criteria. The investment opportunity will also be considered in
terms of its location (how close to home?), the nature of the business and the amount
needed and any other personal investment criteria (Mason and Rogers, 1997). The
business angel will also typically ask themselves two further critical questions: first,
‘do I know anything about this industry, market or technology?’ and, second, ‘can I
add any value to this business?’ Clearly, the ability to add value is very often a

16

<-----Page 17----->function of whether the angel is familiar with the industry. If the answer to either
question is negative then the opportunity will be rejected at this point.

Angels then undertake a quick review of those opportunities that fall within their
investment criteria to derive some initial impressions. Although most business angels
expect a business plan, they are unlikely to read it in detail at this stage. Their aim at
this point in the decision-making process is simply to assess whether the proposal has
sufficient merit to justify the investment of time to undertake a detailed assessment.
This stage has been the subject of a detailed analysis by Mason and Rogers (1996;
1997) using verbal protocol analysis, an experimental-type technique which asks
subjects (in this case business angels) to think out loud as they perform a task (in this
case evaluating a real investment opportunity). They observe that angels approach this
stage with a negative mindset, expecting that the opportunity will be poor (because of
the opportunities that they have previously seen) and looking for reasons to reject it.
The market and the entrepreneur are the key considerations at this stage. Less
significant are the product/service and financial factors. Indeed, angels exhibit
considerable scepticism about the value of financial information in the business plan
of start-ups. Nevertheless, investors want to see that there is the potential for
significant financial return, that the principals are financially committed and what the
money that is invested will be used for. Prasad et al (2000) argue that the proportion
of their wealth which entrepreneurs have invested in the business will also be an
important criterion for angels as it is a signal of the entrepreneur’s commitment. Some
angels will be flexible, willing to treat these various criteria as compensatory (e.g. a
strong management team would compensate for a distant location), whereas others
will regard them as non-compensatory (Feeney et al, 1999).

17

<-----Page 18----->In some cases the screening process takes the form of an entrepreneur making an oral
‘pitch’ to an audience of business angels at an investment forum. Studies by Mason
and Harrison (2003) and Clark (2008) both note that the quality of the presentation
does impact on the angel’s screening decision by influencing their judgement about
whether or not to follow-up on an opportunity. Poor presentation is interpreted by
angels as a sign of the entrepreneur’s wider deficiencies.

The purpose of the initial screen is to filter out ‘no hopers’ in so that investors can
focus their time on those opportunities that appear to have potential. These are subject
to more detailed appraisal. This stage has received little attention from researchers. It
would appear that most angels emphasise their intuition and gut feeling rather than
performing formal analysis (Haines et al, 2003) – although more experienced angels,
and angel groups adopt more sophisticated approaches (e.g. see Blair, 1996).7
According to May and Simmons (2001: 101) “it might consist of a few phone calls
and a visit or two, or weeks of meetings, documents flying back and forth and
questions, questions, questions.” However, getting to know the principals personally
(by a series of formal and informal meetings) is the most vital part of the process
(May and Simmons, 2001). Harrison et al (1997) have argued that the building of trust
between the angel and the entrepreneur is critical for an investment to occur.

Once the opportunity has passed from the initial screen the importance of ‘people’
factors becomes critical (Riding et al, 1995), with investors emphasising management
abilities, an understanding of what is required to be successful, a strong work ethic,
integrity, honesty, openness and personal chemistry (Haines et al, 2003; Mason and

18

<-----Page 19----->Stark, 2004). This reflects the long and personal nature of the angel-entrepreneur
relationship. Rewards, realism of the projections and potential also assume greater
importance while ‘investor fit’ becomes less of a consideration (Riding et al, 1995).
Reasons for rejecting an opportunity also change as the process unfolds. Deals that are
rejected at the initial review stage are because of the accumulation of multiple
deficiencies, whereas those rejected after more detailed investigation are more likely
to be due to a single deal killer (Mason and Harrison, 1996a).

The key role of the entrepreneur/management team in the decision whether or not to
invest is confirmed in various studies. Using conjoint analysis – a method to measure
quantitatively the relative importance of one decision-making criteria in relation to
another (see Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999) – Landström (1998) found that business
angels attach the greatest importance to the leadership capabilities of the principals,
followed by the potential of the firm’s market and products. Feeney et al’s (1999)
approach was to ask business angels “what are the most common shortcomings of
business opportunities that you have reviewed recently?” This highlighted
shortcomings in both the management (lack of management knowledge, lack of
realistic expectations, personal qualities) and the business (poor management team,
poor profit potential for the level of risk, poor fit, undercapitalised/lack of liquidity,
insufficient information provided). Asking investors “what are the essential factors
that prompted you to invest in the firms that you have chosen?” (Feeney et al, 1999)
highlighted three management attributes – track record, realism and integrity and
openness – and four attributes of the business – potential for high profit, an exit plan,
security on their investment and involvement of the investor. However, while the
primarily deal killer is the perception of poor management, the decision to invest in an

19

<-----Page 20----->opportunity involves a consideration of management ability, growth and profit
potential. In other words, angels are looking for businesses that show growth potential
and have an entrepreneurial team with the capability to realise that potential (Feeney
et al, 1999). Both these studies also emphasise that investment criteria are personal,
with angels using different criteria in their assessment of investment proposals. For
example, Feeney et al (1999) suggest that the decision processes of more experienced
investors differs from that of less experienced investors.

This emphasis on the entrepreneur reflects the view of angels that agency risk is more
of a threat than market risk. Fiet (1995) argues that business angels lack information
or the tools and resources to evaluate market risks effectively. As a consequence, they
specialise in evaluating agency risk – assessing whether or not the entrepreneur can be
relied upon as a venture manager – while relying upon competent and trustworthy
entrepreneurs to manage market risk. This contrasts with venture capital funds which
attach more importance to market risk than agency risk. They are less concerned with
agency risk because they have learnt how to protect themselves using stringent
boilerplate contractual provisions which allows them to replace an entrepreneur who
is not performing or is found to be incompetent. Thus, “compared with venture capital
investors, business angels place much more importance upon screening entrepreneurs
than deals for market risk” (Fiet, 1995: 567).

The evaluation stage ends when the angel has decided whether or not to negotiate a
deal with the entrepreneur. In their Canadian study Riding et al (1993) found that
72.6% of opportunities were rejected at the initial impressions stage, a further 15.9%
were rejected following more detailed evaluation, and as this stage proceeds another

20

<-----Page 21----->6.3% were eliminated, a cumulative rejection rate of 94.8%. Thus, business angels
proceed to the negotiation stage with only 5% of the investment opportunities that
they receive.

4.3 Negotiation and contracting
Having decided, in principle, to invest the business angel must negotiate terms and
conditions of the investment that are acceptable both to themselves and also to the
entrepreneur. There are three main issues – valuation, structuring of the deal (share
price, type of shares, size of shareholding, timing) and the terms and conditions of the
investment, including the investor’s role. In agency theory terms deal structuring –
mechanisms for allocating the rewards to the investor and entrepreneur – are an
attempt to align the behaviour of the entrepreneur with that of the investor, while the
terms and conditions attempt to control the behaviour of the entrepreneur. These are
major lacunae in informal venture capital market research.

In the study by Riding et al (1993) half of the investment opportunities that reached
this stage were not consummated. The most frequent reason for not making an
investment was associated with valuation, notably “inappropriate views by
entrepreneurs (in the opinion of the investors) regarding the value of the firm as a
whole and, within the firm, the value of an idea compared to the overall value of a
business. Most investors note that potential entrepreneurs overvalue the idea and
undervalue the potential contributions (both financial and non-financial) that are
required to grow and develop a business” (Haines et al, 2003: 24).

21

<-----Page 22----->There is no universally agreed method of valuing a small company. Market-based
valuations are inappropriate because small businesses are not continually valued by
the market and appropriate comparator stocks are unlikely to be available. Assetbased valuations are more commonly used although finance theory prefers earnings or
cash-flow based valuations because they value the business in terms of the future
stream of earnings that shareholders might expect from the business. However, these
approaches are complex. Valuation of new and early stage businesses adds further
complications because they may only have intangible assets (e.g. intellectual
property). It is therefore not surprising, especially since most angel investments are
concentrated at start-up and early stage, that methods of pricing and calculating the
size of shareholdings are remarkably imprecise and subjective (Mason and Harrison,
1996b), based on rough rules of thumb or gut feeling. As investors, May and
Simmons (2001: 129) note that “the truth about valuing a start-up is that it’s often a
guess.” Where an attempt is made to price the investment on a more rigorous basis
then the earnings based approach is the most common method (Lengyel and Gulliford,
1997).

Angels draw up contracts as a matter of course to safeguard their investment, although
their degree of sophistication varies. Contracts specify the rights and obligations of
both parties and what will by done, by whom and over what time frame. Their
objective is to align the incentives of the entrepreneur and the investor by means of
performance incentives and direct control measures. Kelly and Hay (2003) note that
certain issues are non-negotiable: veto rights over acquisitions/divestments, prior
approval for strategic plans and budgets, restrictions on the ability of management to
issue share options, non-compete contracts required by entrepreneurs on the

22

<-----Page 23----->termination of their employment in the business, and restrictions on the ability to raise
additional debt or equity finance. These issues give investors a say in material
decisions that could impact the nature of the business or the level of equity holding.
However, there are also a number of contractual provisions to which angels attach low
importance, and which might be considered to be negotiable. Less experienced
investors place relatively greater emphasis on the need to include a broad array of
contractual safeguards to protect their interests. However, experienced investors are
more likely to include specific provisions that can impact the level of their equity
stake (share options, ratchets) and the timing of exit (forced exit provisions). In other
words, with experience business angels become more focused on those elements that
can impact their financial return.

Investors recognise that the investment agreement must be fair to both sides (May and
Simmons, 2001): contracts that favour the investor will be detrimental to the
entrepreneur’s motivation. In Mason and Harrison’s (1996b) study, two-thirds of
investors and entrepreneurs considered that the investment agreement was equally
favourable to both sides, and half of the investors reported that this was their
intention. Indeed, a significant minority of investors believed that the agreement
actually favoured the entrepreneur. Thus, the available evidence suggests that in most
cases entrepreneurs are not exploited by business angels when raising finance.

The inclusion of contractual safeguards does not indicate whether investors will be
willing to invoke them to protect their interests. Moreover, contracts are, of necessity,
incomplete by their very nature. There are three reasons for this: it is costly to write
complete contracts; it is impossible to foresee all contingencies; and on account of

23

<-----Page 24----->asymmetric information (van Osnabrugge, 2000). Thus, in practice investors place a
heavy reliance on their relationship with the entrepreneur to deal with any problems
that arise (van Osnabrugge, 2000; Kelly and Hay, 2003). Indeed, Landström et al
(1998) argue that one of the purposes of establishing a contractual framework at the
outset is to provide a basis for the development of a relationship between the parties to
develop. In other words, the contract is less a protection mechanism per se; rather, it
is a means by which mutual behaviour expectations of all parties in the transaction
can be clarified.

Most angel investments involve limited input from professional advisers. For
example, lawyers would normally review, and might draw up, the investment
agreement, but would not be involved in the negotiations. Similarly, accountants may
be consulted for advice but would rarely play a more prominent role. Thus,
transactions costs are low (Mason and Harrison, 1996b). In Lengyel and Gulliford’s
(1997) study the entrepreneur’s costs amounted to an average of 5.1% of the funds
raised (and 29% reported no costs) while for the investor the average costs were 2.8%
of the amount invested (and 57% reported no costs).

Because angels are only answerable to themselves and are investing their own money
they are able to make quicker investment decisions than those of venture capital funds
(Freear et al, 1995). Mason and Harrison (1996b) report that in their study the entire
investment process rarely extended over more than three months, and often took less
than a month. Most negotiations took less than a week to complete. Thus, in nearly
half of the investments less than a month elapsed between the entrepreneur’s first

24

<-----Page 25----->meeting with the investor and the decision to invest; in 85% of cases the elapsed time
was under three months.

4.4 Post investment involvement
From an agency perspective, monitoring is the main way in which principals attempt
to mitigate the risk of opportunistic behaviour on the part of the agent going
undetected. In line with this expectation, most business angels play an active role in
their investee businesses. There is a spectrum of involvement: at one extreme are
passive investors who are content to receive occasional information to monitor the
performance of their investment while at the other extreme are investors who use their
investment to buy themselves a job. However, most angels do not want day-to-day
involvement hence the typical involvement ranges from a day a week (or its
equivalent) to less than a day a month (Mason and Harrison, 1996b). Nevertheless,
Sætre (2003) emphasises that some angels are so involved, and involved so early, that
they are indistinguishable from the entrepreneurs, and are seen by the entrepreneurs as
being part of the entrepreneurial team. In similar vein, Politis and Landström (2002)
see angel investing as simply a continuation of an entrepreneurial career.

Madill et al (2005) identify a number of roles that business angels play in their
investee businesses: advice about the management of the business, contacts, hands-on
assistance (e.g. legal advice, accountancy advice, provision of resources), providing
business and marketing intelligence, serving on the Board of Directors or Advisory
Board, preparing firms to raise venture capital and providing credibility and
validation. Sætre (2003) makes a distinction between two types of value-added
contributions of angel investors: ‘competent capital’ (general management skills and

25

<-----Page 26----->business experience) and ‘relevant capital’ (industry know how and contacts). Angels
often also play an important role in helping their investee businesses to raise
additional finance (Madill et al, 2005; Sørheim, 2005). Landström (1992) notes that
frequency of contact between angels and their investee companies is inversely related
to the geographical distance that separates them. It will also be influenced by the
performance of the business, with angels more involved at particular stages of
business development and in crisis situations.

However, in contrast to agency theory the involvement of angels in their investee
businesses is not motivated by monitoring considerations. As noted earlier, angels
derive psychic income from their involvement in their investee businesses in the form
of fun and satisfaction from being involved with new and growing businesses and
their belief that their experience, know how and insights can ‘make a difference’.8
Kelly and Hay (2003: 309) comment that “from the outset, the relationship between
the business angel and the entrepreneur appears to be more positive and trusting in
character than the inherently adversarial one implied by agency theorists.” This
suggests that angels see themselves as ‘offering help’ rather than ‘checking up’ on
their investee businesses by acting as mentors, providing contacts, guidance and
hands-on assistance (Haines et al, 2003).

A majority of entrepreneurs and angels regard their relationship as productive and
consensual – although entrepreneurs have a more favourable view of its
productiveness than angels (Freear et al, 1995; Mason and Harrison, 1996b). One
study reported that half of the entrepreneurs who had raised finance from business
angels regarded their contributions as being helpful or very helpful (Mason and

26

<-----Page 27----->Harrison, 1996b). Another study reported that entrepreneurs considered that the most
valuable contribution of their business angel has been as a sounding board (Harrison
and Mason, 1992a). There is a suggestion that entrepreneurs want their investors to be
more involved in certain areas, especially financial management (Ehrlich et al, 1994).
Criticisms by entrepreneurs who have raised finance from angels are mainly
concerned with those who lack knowledge of the product or market (Lengyel and
Gulliford, 1997). Finally, most business angels report that they have derived fun and
enjoyment from their investments, often more than expected. However, this is not the
case when their investee business has failed. Psychic income returns are therefore
related to business performance rather than compensating for financial loss (Mason
and Harrison, 1996b). However, there has been no rigorous attempt to assess whether
this involvement of business angels has a favourable impact on the performance of
their investee businesses.

4.5 Harvesting
Investing in unquoted companies is regarded as being high risk. Certainly, the
performance of European venture capital funds specialising in early stage investments
(in practice this means technology-focussed investments) have much lower rates of
return than those which focus on later stage investments (EVCA, 2005). There are
only three studies of the investment returns of business angels: a small scale Finnish
study (Lumme et al, 1998) and larger UK (Mason and Harrison, 2002b) and US
(Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007) studies. It is important to note that these studies only
measure multiples achieved on the amounts originally invested. However, many
angels also attempt to draw back at least part of their investment in the form of a
director’s fee or interest on loans provided, either immediately or at some stage in the

27

<-----Page 28----->future when the business is financially stronger. This could be quite a significant
proportion of the investment in smaller deals (Mason and Harrison, 1996b; Lengyel
and Gulliford, 1997). The findings clearly indicate the highly skewed distribution of
returns:
•

In the UK study 40% of investments made a loss (34% a total loss), and
another 13% only achieved break-even or generated bank account-level
returns. However, there was a significant subset of investments, some 23% in
total, which generated internal rates of return (IRRs) in excess of 50%.9

•

In the US study 48% of investments returned more cash than the angel had
invested, but only 7% returned more than 10 times the initial investment. The
average return was 2.6 times.

Both the UK and US studies went on to explore the types of investments that were
likely to be successful. The UK study identified large investments, large deal sizes
and deals involving multiple investors as being more likely to be high performing
investments (Mason and Harrison, 2002b). A separate analysis comparing the returns
distribution of technology and non-technology investments found no significant
differences (Mason and Harrison, 2004a). This may suggest that the risk of investing
in technology sectors has been over-stated. Another possibility is that business angels
are better able to mitigate the risks involved in investing in technology businesses on
account of their specialist expertise and entrepreneurial background.

The US study also sought to identify what investment practices were associated with
the rate of return. High returns were associated with the length of due diligence by the
investor, the investor’s expertise in the industry and their post-investment

28

<-----Page 29----->participation. Low returns were associated with follow-on investments (Wiltbank and
Boeker, 2007).

The Finnish study sought to identify differences between the most, and least,
successful investors. The most successful investors were more likely to be motivated
by the fun and interest of making such investments, have a large deal flow and have a
lower estimation of the value of their hands-on involvement. The least successful
investors were more likely to be motivated by altruism, have a low deal flow and
make few investments and rely to a greater extent on friends for deal flow. They were
also more likely to make investments in friends’ businesses and have a different
pattern of hands-on involvement, over-emphasising contributions that other research
has suggested are least important in adding value (Lumme et al, 1998).

Business angels are thought to be relatively patient investors, willing to hold their
investments for up to seven years or more (Wetzel, 1981; Mason and Harrison, 1994).
In reality, angels hold their investments for a much shorter time. The average holding
period amongst US investors is 3.5 years (Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007). For UK
investors the median time to exit is four years for high performing investments and six
years for moderately performing investments, while failures appear, on average, after
two years (Mason and Harrison, 2002b). In Finland investments that had a positive
outcome were five years old at harvest whereas those which failed had an average
holding time of 2.8 years. In both studies a trade sale (i.e. sale of the company to
another company) was the most common exit route for successful investments, with
an IPO only accounting for a small minority of cases. Trade sales, along with sale to

29

<-----Page 30----->existing shareholders were the most common exit routes for investments with little or
no value.

5. THE EVOLUTION OF THE ANGEL MARKET
The angel market place is evolving from a largely invisible, atomistic market
dominated by individual and small ad hoc groups of investors who strive to keep a
low profile and rely on word-of-mouth for their investment opportunities, to a more
organised and professional market place in which angel syndicates (sometimes termed
‘structured angel groups’) are becoming increasingly significant (May and Simmons;
2001; May, 2002; May and O’Halloran, 2003). There are currently estimated to be
around 250 angel syndicates located throughout the USA and growing evidence of
specialisation by industry sector (e.g. health care angel syndicates) and type of
investor (e.g. women-only angel syndicates: Sohl and Hill, 2007). A national body to
bring angel groups together for the purposes of transferring best practice, lobbying
and data collection was created in 2003 (Angel Capital Association). The same trend
is also evident in other countries, such as the UK, Canada and Australia, but is at an
earlier stage, and it has not attracted the same degree of attention from researchers or
commentators. Nevertheless, solo investors still dominate the market (Lengyel and
Gulliford, 1997; Investor Pulse, 2003; Infometrics, 2004)

Angel syndicates have emerged because individual angels found advantages of
working together, notably in terms of better deal flow, superior evaluation and due
diligence of investment opportunities, and the ability to make more and bigger
investments, as well as social attractions. They operate by aggregating the investment
capacity of individual high net worth individuals (HNWIs). Groups typically range

30

<-----Page 31----->from 25 to 75 members. Syndicates take various forms but in the most common model
a manager or a core group of members will screen the deal flow and select the
companies which are invited to pitch to members. Members then vote whether to
pursue their interest in the business. If the vote is in favour a sub-group will be
appointed to undertake the due diligence and report back to the full membership, and
if the recommendation is positive, individual members make their own decisions
whether or not to invest (there is likely to be a minimum investment threshold for
each deal) and the syndicate will combine all of the member dollars into a single
investment. Some of the larger and longer established US syndicates have also
established sidecar funds – that is, pooled sources of capital that invest alongside the
angel group. The investors in such funds are normally the syndicate members but may
also include other HNWIs or institutions. These funds give the syndicate additional
capital to invest in deals to avoid dilution and enables syndicate members to achieve
greater diversification by exposing them to more investments than they can make
directly through the syndicate.10

The emergence of angel syndicates is of enormous significance for the development
and maintenance of an entrepreneurial economy. First, they reduce sources of
inefficiency in the angel market. The angel market has traditionally been characterised
by inefficiency on account of the fragmented and invisible nature of angels, whereas
angel syndicates are generally visible and are therefore easier for entrepreneurs to
approach. Second, they have stimulated the supply-side of the market. Syndicates
offer considerable attractions for HNWIs who want to invest in emerging companies.
Other attractions of syndicates are that they enable individual angels to invest in
particular opportunities that they could never have invested in as individuals, achieve

31

<-----Page 32----->diversification, and offer the opportunity to learn from more experienced investors.
Third, they are helping to fill the ‘new’ equity gap that has arisen as venture capital
funds have consistently raised their minimum size of investment and are increasingly
abandoning the early stage market. This gap is in the ₤0.5m to ₤2m range (Almeida
Capital, 2005) is too large for typical ‘3F’ money (founder, family, friends) and
exceeds the maximum permitted investment size for most public sector funds. Angel
syndicates are now increasingly the only source for venture capital in this range.
Fourth, and linked to the previous point, unlike individual angels and ad hoc angel
groups, angel syndicates have the ability to provide follow-on funding which is
increasingly required as a result of the withdrawal of many venture capital funds from
making small, early stage investments. Finally, the range of business expertise that is
found amongst angel syndicate members means that in most circumstances they are
able to contribute much greater value-added to investee businesses than an individual
business angel, or even most early stage venture capital funds.

6. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
This paper has sought to highlight the significance of business angel investing as a
source of funding for entrepreneurial businesses and to argue that it has not attracted
the attention of researchers that its significance deserves. Kelly (2007: 328) correctly
notes that “considerable progress has been made mapping the business angel terrain.”
The initial studies in the 1980s and early 1990s were descriptive, aimed at profiling
angel characteristics, motivations and investment activity. Recent research has
become more analytical, focusing on actual behaviour rather than preferences, on
aspects of the investment process rather than on the actors, and has become more
anchored in theory, with several studies using agency theory as a framework for

32

<-----Page 33----->analysis. However, as Kelly (2007: 328) continues, “much remains to be done.” He
identifies the need for better samples and research design, clarification of terminology
and definitions, and more theoretical studies.

The angel market is invisible and fragmented. There are no directories of angel
investors and their investments are not recorded in any systematic way. It is therefore
extremely difficult to measure either the size of the market, the number of business
angel investors or the level of investment activity or to track trends over time. Thus, a
first priority must be to develop time-series data on angel investment activity that
parallels what already exists for the venture capital market in order to provide an
accurate measure of market size, investment activity and the types of investments
being made. This is an essential requirement for policy-makers, both to identify the
need for intervention and the impact of such intervention (Mason and Harrison, 2008).
Collecting investment statistics from angel groups is an obvious starting point.11
However, although this is a significant part of the market, especially in terms of the
amount invested, it is still partial coverage. A more promising approach is Industry
Canada’s Survey of Financing of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, a periodic
large scale survey of the financing experiences of SME owners. Given that many
angels are entrepreneurs, the 2002 and 2005 surveys asked business owners if they
had made investments in non-public unrelated businesses. Grossing up the responses
to allow for sampling and non-responses and adding a scaling factor to account for the
fact that business owners are only a subset of the angel population provides an
estimate of both the population of business angels in Canada and their investment
activity in specific years (Riding, 2008).

33

<-----Page 34----->A further consequence of the difficulties in identifying business angels is that research
has typically been based on small-scale snapshot samples of convenience which are
unsuited to statistical analysis. A second priority is therefore to develop longitudinal
research on the angel market. Much of the research on venture capital is ‘timeless’ in
the sense that it does not reflect the economic conditions of the time (Mason and
Harrison, 2004b). Thus, an important dimension of such longitudinal studies involves
relating investment trends to the wider economic conditions of the time. For example,
how angels responded to the post-2000 investment downturn remains largely
unexplored and unanswered (but see Mason, 2006b, for a brief discussion).
Longitudinal studies can take several dimensions, each with a different unit of
analysis.
•

investments: collecting time-series data on angel investment activity which
will provide information on investor and investment trends.

•

deals: deals are tracked from the point of referral to the angel through to
rejection or investment and on to subsequent funding round and exit.

•

investors: Politis and Landström (2002) have proposed the concept of an
‘angel career’ which demands further scrutiny. Specifically, there is a need to
explore angel learning, drawing upon the growing interest in entrepreneurial
learning (Harrison and Leitch, 2008).

Third, the notion that the angel market and the institutional venture capital market
play complementary roles in the financing of entrepreneurial businesses is deeply
ingrained. For example, Campbell (2003) comments that “angels and venture
capitalists inhabit the same ecosystem” and are “two vital constituents of the same
food chain.” Studies by Freear and Wetzel (1989) and Madill et al (2005) have both

34

<-----Page 35----->found that raising finance from business angels is often a pre-requisite for
subsequently raising one or more rounds from venture capitalists. This has prompted
some commentators to use the metaphor of a relay race to describe the relationship
between angels and VCFs. For example, Benjamin and Margulis (2000) offer the
following description: “It boils down to this. Angel investment runs the critical first
leg of the relay race, passing the baton to venture capital only after a company has
begun to find its stride. Venture capitalists focus … on expansion and later stages of
development, when their contribution is most effective. In this way venture capital
investment complements rather than conflicts with private investment.” Timmons and
Sapienza (1992) draw upon American sport for an alternative metaphor, describing
this sequential relationship between angels and venture capital funds as “a kind of
‘farm system of venture portfolios’”. However, recent commentators (Mason, 2006b;
Kelly, 2007) have raised the possibility that the angel and venture capital markets
may, in fact, be diverging from one another as venture capital funds continue to shift
their investment focus to larger and later stage deals and angel syndicates, because of
their financial resources, are able to undertake multiple funding rounds.

The emergence of angel syndicates raises a series of questions. Are they attracting
investors who are new to the market, and thus new money that would otherwise have
been invested elsewhere, or are they attracting solo angels? If they are attracting solo
angels, will this deplete the population of small-scale investors and thereby re-open
the sub £250,000/$500,000 equity gap? As angel syndicates become more organised
and develop fixed costs will this lead to an upward drift in their investment activity,
thereby re-opening the equity gap? As angel activity becomes increasingly organised
and professionalised is there a risk that the essence of angel investing gets lost?

35

<-----Page 36----->Many governments now recognise the economic significance of business angels and
have introduced various measures to support the informal venture capital market
(Murray, 2007; Mason, 2009). However, there is very little substantive evidence on
the impact of such schemes. Aernoudt (1999) therefore argues that the case for
government intervention is not proven. Thus, there is scope for further applied
research which explores whether the case for intervention is justified, and if the case
is supported what is the most appropriate form(s) of intervention.

Finally, there are also a host of issues where information is either lacking or requires
corroboration. Examples of the former include identifying the characteristics of
altruistic investors (Sullivan, 1994), women business angels (Brush et al, 2002;
Harrison and Mason, 2007) and successful investors (Kelly and Hay, 1996; 2000).
The demand side, and specifically the process of raising finance, has been largely
ignored. One business angel observed that “the first business plan is not the one that
gets funded.”12 What do angels learn from feedback from business angels who they
meet but do not invest and how do they use this learning to re-shape their business
proposal? The negotiation, valuation and contracting stages remain poorly understood.
For example, exploring the entrepreneur’s perspective would be a useful way in which
to extend Kelly and Hay’s (2003) pioneering study of business angel contracts. Many
aspects of the post-investment relationship also require to be examined.
Understanding the relational component is one issue. How do the parties cope with
adversity? When do business angels find it necessary to assert their rights and how do
they do so? (Kelly and Hay, 2003). How do entrepreneurs, angels and later stage
investors interact? Specifically, how does the angel’s role change when venture

36

<-----Page 37----->capitalists come on board? Quantifying the impact of the value-added contribution of
angels on business performance, and the contributions of different types of business
angels, is another issue that requires attention. More studies of investment returns are
required to corroborate existing studies by Mason and Harrison (2002b) and Wiltbank
and Boeker (2007). Meanwhile, adopting new methodological approaches to explore
topics that are better understood (e.g. investment decision-making) might provide new
insights or challenge existing understanding. Finally, future research needs to have
stronger theoretical foundations. Agency theory – the most commonly used theoretical
framework - has been shown to have its limitations in a business angel context
(Landström, 1992; Kelly and Hay 2003), thus, there is a need for alternative
theoretical perspectives.
NOTES
1

The term angel was coined by Broadway insiders in the early 1900s to describe wealthy theatre-goers
who made high risk investments in theatrical productions. Angels invested in these shows primarily for
the privilege of rubbing shoulders with the theatre personalities that they admired. The term business
angel was given to those individuals who perform essentially the same function in a business context
(Benjamin and Margulis, 2000: 5). There is a long tradition of angel investing in businesses (Sohl,
2003). However, this type of business financing has only become significant since the 1950s and 1960s
when a lot of the pioneering garage start-ups in Silicon Valley obtained their initial funding from this
source.
2
However, there is a greater chance of a mismatch between the needs of the entrepreneurs and the
preferences and value-added skills of potential investors in such regions. Johnstone (2001) notes that in
the case of Cape Breton demand for angel finance is concentrated amongst IT businesses and they want
investors to provide marketing and management inputs whereas the investors typically have no
knowledge of the sector and so have limited ability to add value.
3
See Mason (2009) for a review of European public policy initiatives.
4
These are organisations established by public sector economic development agencies to facilitate
more angel investment activity by enabling entrepreneurs seeking finance to come to the attention of
business angels seeking investment opportunities. They can be thought of as being similar to ‘dating
agencies’ (see Harrison and Mason, 1996).
5
Indeed, the debate between Mason and Harrison and Stevenson and Coveney over their starkly
contrasting findings probably arose because their approaches to identifying business angels involved
over-sampling from the extremes of the distribution, with Mason and Harrison (1994; 1997) oversampling from the left hand of the distribution while Stevenson and Coveney (1994; 1996) oversampled from the right hand tail because they surveyed subscribers to a high cost investment
opportunities magazine which it was not cost effective for small, infrequent investors to purchase.
6
Visser and Williams (2001) emphasise that T&T artists are distinguished from ‘company doctors’
who may be called in to turn a business round, but do not necessarily invest their own money, and from
‘corporate raiders’ who may, or may not, invest their own money but whose aim is to sell off valuable
components of the business as soon as possible.

May and Simmons (2001: 156) quote one investor as follows: “I’ve never had as much fun in my life.
It’s a joy to see someone listen, take action and win.”

Comparison with the returns achieved by institutional venture capital investors is problematic because
the reporting unit is the fund, whereas angels invest on a deal-by-deal basis. However, Murray (1999)
has reported deal specific returns for one UK venture capital fund. Comparing the returns achieved by
business angels with this information reveals a much higher loss rate by the venture capital fund (64%)
and a lower proportion of investments that generated a moderate return, but very similar proportion of
high return investments (IRR in excess of 50%).
10
Sidecar funds have not emerged in the UK because such investments do not qualify for tax relief
under the Enterprise Investment Scheme.
