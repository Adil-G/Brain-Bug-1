Executive Summary

Indian venture capital industry is one of the predominant players among South Asian
countries. New funds have opened their shop here and are continuing to bring in more
funds. The industry has undergone a major shift in focus. India is not a country which
offers lower-cost production alternatives but is a high-tech and global outsourcing
centre.
The present study reports four factors which are used by the venture capitalists to
screen new venture proposals. Using Kendalls tau-c analysis, the study brings out strong
association between several variable pairs. Broadly, the analysis finds that:
Ø Successful venture teams put in sustained efforts on identified target markets.
Ø They are highly meticulous while attending to the details.
Ø These teams are adept at dealing with risk because of their impeccable past
experience.
Ø Indian venture capitalists do not seem to be much enamoured of technology
venturing; at least some of the successful ventures funded by them do not seem to
show signs of being hi-tech.
The study brings out four important variables which are highly unique to successful
venture in India. They are:
Ø ability to evaluate and react to risk
Ø attention to details
Ø market share
Ø profits.
Evaluating risk seems to be an area where unsuccessful ventures fail. Since
successful teams focus on established markets and meticulously pursue these markets
to gain market share, they achieve desired profits.

enture capital has evolved as a concept that not
only deals with providing investment capital to
relatively untried ideas but also participates in
the management decision-making process, thus helping
entrepreneurial teams with strategic inputs. Since
providing finance to untried ideas is fraught with danger
of significant erosion of capital, and in some cases may
cause a total loss, the expectation of the venture capitalist
is very high. Typically, venture capitalists would expect
a return of 40 per cent from their investments and they
are considered as experts in identifying business ideas
with high returns.
Many studies (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; Macmillan,
Siegel and Narsimha, 1985; Macmillan, Zemann and
Narsimha, 1987) have investigated venture, capitalists
and the means by which they assess new ventures, and
they have brought out the importance of certain specific
criteria attributable to potential business plans. These
studies found that venture screening process is a simple
but highly skillful activity in which venture capitalists
quickly gauge the potential of a business plan based on
certain criteria. Some recent studies (Sandberg, 1988; Hall
and Hofer, 1993; Zacharakis and Meyer; 1998; Shepherd,
1999) have emphasized the need to study the process by
employing real time tools like verbal protocol and conjoint
analysis.

In this study, we have employed a questionnairebased analysis to investigate the venture evaluation
process in India. We provide a summary of the venture
capital experience in India in Box 1. The paucity of research
based on Indian venture capitalists motivated the present
study to follow the method used by Macmillan, Zemann
and Narsimha (1987) because the variables identified in
the study were developed over a period of time by several
studies and are robust when it comes to reliability.1 A
previous study in India (Pandey, 1996) which studied
evaluation criteria was based on Macmillan, Siegel and
Narsimha (1985). It reported as many as 11 criteria which
are rated high by many venture capitalists and most of
these criteria are considered in the due diligence activity
and not so much in the screening process.

REVIEW OF LITERA
TURE
LITERATURE
A number of studies on the venture capitalists’ screening
criteria was first conducted in the US. In Table 1, we
provide a summary of some major studies abroad. Tyebjee
and Bruno (1984) found that venture capitalists look for
the market attractiveness of the potential venture and the
product differentiation as critical factors for funding. The

Reliability is the extent to which a variable or set of variables is consistent
in what it or they intended to measure.

Box 1 : The Venture Capital Experience in India
The government’s decision to encourage knowledge-entrepreneurship through the promotion of venture capital industry was in the
right spirit. But, the policy guidelines framed to establish the industry in November 1988 proved to be highly restrictive. It only
pictured the government’s caution in allowing private enterprises to flourish. The venture capital guidelines actually proved to be
counter-productive. For instance, there were no tax incentives for either the venture capitalists or investors in the venture capital
guidelines.
In 1996, the Finance Minister in his budget speech repealed the November 1988 guidelines and announced tax concession
to the industry. Fresh guidelines were issued by the SEBI in 1996 and, for the first time, the guidelines recognized the importance
of hands-off regulation. Some of the recent amendments to the guidelines include the lifting of 40 per cent ceiling on equity
contribution to a single venture. Now, a venture capital fund can have 100 per cent of company equity to finance the project (The
Economic Times, 1999). In order to give a fillip to venture activity in India, several committees were set up to identify lacunae
in the policy guidelines. The recent Chandershaker’s committee which presented its report in the year 2000 came up with several
changes to facilitate flow of foreign capital into India which the government has agreed to in principle.
The formation of Indian Venture Capital Association (IVCA) is yet another development which coordinates the activities of all
the players. Over the last few years, it has become a strong pressure group and has called for several changes in the policy
of the government.
Venture Capital Commitments
Indian venture capital industry is now considered as one of the predominant players among South Asian countries. The industry
underwent a major shift in focus. It is not one of those countries which offers lower-cost production alternatives, but is a hi-tech
and global outsourcing centre. New funds have opened their shop here in India and are continuing to bring in more and more
funds.
The size of total funds committed to this industry was Rs 4918.9 million in 1993. This figure rose up by 27 times to Rs 1,35,053
million in 2000. The industry committed a large pool of resources but only about 50 per cent of it was invested in various ventures
leaving a significant portion uninvested. The reason is venture capitalists are unable to find good quality deal flow (Kumar Vinay,
Shah and Nadkarni, 2002). In 1993, venture capital industry invested Rs 3,174 million in 428 companies while in 2000 it invested
Rs 43,563 million in 1,314 companies. Indian venture capital industry provided seed finance of Rs 1,200 million, start-up finance
of Rs 1,843 million, and early-stage finance of Rs 14,126 million in 2000.
Venture capital grew more cautious in investing in new opportunities in 2001(IVCA Year Book, 2001). This trend is not unusual
because a similar pattern can be observed in the international venture capital markets. The year 2001 witnessed a fall of 21.8
per cent in disbursements when compared to the previous year.

study also investigated the importance of business plan
and reported that the business plan contents should also
depict the quality of entrepreneur who is seeking venture
funds. The study identified six risk categories:

•
risk of being unable to bail out, if necessary
•
risk of failure to implement the idea
•
competitive risk
•
risk of management failure
•

Summary of Findings
Venture capitalist’s decision criteria
include market attractiveness,
product differentiation, managerial
capabilities, environmental threat,
and cash-out potential
Venture capitalist’s evaluation criteria
were grouped into six categories.
Major factors were found that are
used to avert risk such as management risk, product risk, viability risk,
and liquidity risk.
Management staying power and
familiarity with market were judged
as the most important characteristics
of a successful venture
There is a contingent relationship
among the criteria used by venture
capital firms. Venture capitalists
study industry characteristics, track
record, and the proposed strategy.
The key criteria identified in the
study are long-term growth and
profitability of the industry

importantly, the study pointed out how successful ventures
are distinguished from unsuccessful ventures. This study
requested a posteriori ratings and not a priori. It identified
five major classes of risk management. They are:
•
ventures where there is risk of failure due to
unqualified management team
•
management with lack of experience
•
ventures where basic viability is in doubt
•
ventures where there is high exposure to competitive
threats and profits get marginalized before investment is recouped
•
ventures which lock up the investment, so that it
cannot be cashed out for long periods of time.
All the above studies have employed either structured interviews or structured questionnaire as their data
collection plan. The argument that venture capitalists are
not good at exactly recalling the decision-making criteria
while filling up the questionnaire or while being
interviewed is picking up. The argument seems to hold

<-----Page 3----->water both from the angle of qualitative research and
social judgment theory (a technique from cognitive
psychology). Sandberg and Hofer (1987) used a
qualitative technique called verbal protocol in which
decision-makers think aloud to access the criteria being
used by the venture capitalists. The technique actually
records the important factors while the decision is being
taken. The study reported the same criteria with a different
approach. It revealed that the industry characteristics and
management track record are the essential criteria. Hall
and Hofer (1993) also used a similar technique. The
findings suggest that venture capitalists typically screen
out ventures in about six minutes and take about 21
minutes to carry out the total assessment to decide
whether to go for a venture or reject. Key criteria reported
by the study are venture’s fit with venture capitalists’
long-term growth and profitability. The study of
Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) used social judgment theory
from cognitive psychology and applied a tool called policy
capturing to the problem of venture screening. The study
confirmed that there can be systematic biases which
impede venture capitalists’ decision and a better tool to
capture the real decision when venture capitalists are
surrounded by large information would be policy
capturing, provided more cues are placed in the
experiment. Shepherd (1999) enquired into venture capital
decision-making process using conjoint analysis to
compare the “In Use” decision policies with “Espoused
or Self Reported” policies. This is yet another technique
which analyses data that are collected on the decision at
the time of decision-making. The study provides evidence
that venture capitalists have a tendency to overstate the
least important criterion and understate the very
important criterion.
The problem with these studies is that they point out
the need for collecting real time data of venture capitalist’s
decisions, but they do not seem to report any new real
time criteria. The studies which used verbal protocol
analysis came with criteria which were already reported
by previous studies. However, the studies are significant
as they pave the way for further inquiry which may enable
future research to come up with newer findings.
Venture capital research in Asia is nascent. The
present literature available in venture capital begs for
additional studies because most of the works are
exploratory in nature. Ray and Turpin (1993) attempted
to examine the criteria and methods by which Japanese
venture capitalists evaluate prospective portfolio clients.

The study is based on historical aggregates, interviews,
and survey data collected over a number of years in Japan
and reports on a survey completed by 18 Japanese venture
capitalists, representing more than two-thirds of all
venture capital funds in Japan. Comparisons were drawn
between the US and the Japanese venture capital,
highlighting certain differences. Prominent among them
is the stringent methodology of evaluation in the US while
the Japanese venture capitalists are flexible. Other
differences are: Japanese venture capitalists use a wide
range of information resources and are specialists in
evaluating prospective deals and they look for relatively
focused criteria such as the development of new markets
in evaluating prospective investments. They also rely
more on market criteria.
Pandey and Angela (1996) discuss the status of
venture capital for financing technology in Taiwan. The
study highlighted the role of venture capitalists and their
contribution to investee companies. Comparison between
the perceptions of venture capitalists and the investee
companies was drawn on a set of variables that define the
relationship between venture capitalists and investee
companies. The study reports that the contribution of
venture capitalists is useful. Chotigeat, Pandey and David
(1997) describe the development of venture capital in
Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand and also analyse the
criteria used by venture capital firms (VCFs) in each of
these countries to invest in a venture. The most important
set of criteria for venture capital companies in Sri Lanka
and Taiwan was financial and management team
considerations whereas, in Thailand, venture capitalists
seem to identify management team and characteristics of
entrepreneur as important criteria.
Table 2 presents the summary of major studies on
venture capital in India. Pandey’s (1996) study was the
first to ascertain the evaluation criteria seen by Indian
venture capitalists while screening new venture
proposals. The study was based on Macmillan, Siegel and
Narsimha’s (1985) work and was adapted by adding 21
new variables to it. Some of the new variables are indeed
well thought-out additions like ‘characteristics of
management team.’ Many other variables are good
contributors to the existing fund of knowledge on venture
capital in general. The study found 11 criteria which are
rated high by the Indian venture capitalists. Among them,
integrity, managerial skill, and urge to grow were
prominently rated by the venture capitalists. Since the
nature of analysis was descriptive and prominent means

of the various variables were reported, the study could

Other studies (Kumar, Asim, 1996; Verma, 1997;
Mitra, 2000) covered various facets of Indian venture capital industry and came up with pertinent issues which
were supposed to be addressed by the future government
policy on venture capital. Much of the analysis was based
on annual reports of venture capital industry. While all
these studies emphasized the need for an active support
system by way of a congenial government policy, the
studies have not thrown light on the aspect of actual
practice. Pandey’s (1998) study recounted the emergence
of TDICI as a venture capital firm and pictured practical
problems it faced in order to develop this concept even
before venture capital as an industry gained currency in

vis-à-vis different venture stages. The locational and

across different venture stages. It reports that later stage
funding is based on preference for the percentage
ownership a venture capitalist would buy while
considering ventures. Likewise, the early stage ventures
are governed by locational preferences.

METHODOLOGY
We have used the survey research methodology. A
structured questionnaire similar to that of Macmillan,
Zemann and Narsimha (1987) was mailed to seek the
responses of 22 venture capitalists. These venture
capitalists have been operating in India for more than
five years and are considered to have a fair understanding
of the uniqueness of Indian venture capital practice. By
following a three-phase follow-up method, a high degree
of response was obtained. In all, 13 venture capitalists
responded to the survey but only 11 responses were
useable. The sample represents major classes of venture

<-----Page 5----->capitalists such as venture capital funds of development
financial institutions like IDBI and ICICI, state venture
capital funds like APIDC-VC, funds floated by banks,
private Indian venture funds, and funds floated by foreign
venture funds. The response rate for the survey was high
at 50 per cent. For a mail survey, this kind of response is
considered to be high (Czaja and Blair, 1996). The data
thus received were found to be valid and reliable for
proper statistical analysis.
Since the number of venture capitalists operating in
India for more than five years were less and the responses
were even lesser, the use of parametric statistical models
is not desirable because these models essentially require
large samples and their underlying assumption is
normality in data distribution. The more appropriate
methodology to approach a small sample situation is to
employ distribution free non-parametric statistical
models. The present study thus used non-parametric
analysis for inferring patterns in the data. Each venture
capitalist was sent a set of two identical questionnaires
consisting of 34 variables. One questionnaire sought
responses pertaining to their experience with successful
ventures while the other sought their responses related to
unsuccessful ventures that they have funded. This is called
a dependent sample in statistical terms.
We used Kendall’s tau-c to assess the association between the variables, i.e., monotonicity among respondents.
Kendall’s tau-c is a measure of agreement among many raters
on certain variables. It measure, in percentage terms, the
monotonicity among the variables against other variables
which indicate positive or negative association (Garson, 2003).
To assess the major difference in successful ventures funded
and unsuccessful ventures funded companies, the study
employed Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.
The analysis is performed on two broad areas, viz.,
evaluation criteria and performance criteria. The evaluation criteria included characteristics of entrepreneur
leader, characteristics of product or service, characteristics
of the market, and financial considerations. The performance criteria included items like sales, return on
investment, etc.

FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
The results bring out the significant associations among
each set of variables categorized as characteristics of
entrepreneurial team, characteristics of product or service,
characteristics of market, financial considerations, and
performance criteria. We present Kendell’s tau-c results

which examine the significant associations among each
set of variables mentioned above and significant association between a variable pertaining to a category with a
variable in the other category.

From Table 3, Panel A, it can be noticed that the variable
“capable of sustained efforts” has highly significant and
strong association with the following variables: “ability
to evaluate and react to risk,” “attention to details,”
“familiarity with market targeted by the venture,”
“degree of leadership demonstrated in the past,” “track
record relevant to venture,” and “familiarity with venture
team.” Thus, there exists highly significant and strong
agreement among the venture capitalists that successful
venture teams are capable of putting in sustained efforts.
They focus their efforts on identified target market. They
have demonstrated their abilities in the past and have
high credentials of their past achievements. They seem to
be highly meticulous in attending to the details before
putting in requisite efforts.
Table 3, Panel B, gives the highly significant and
strong association of the variable “ability to evaluate and
react to risk” with variables such as “familiarity with
market targeted by the venture,” and “degree of leadership demonstrated in the past.” Successful teams are
capable of dealing with risk because of their familiarity
with the target market. Since they have delivered results
in the past dealing with such markets, they are in a better
position to evaluate risk and deal with it appropriately.
Panel C in Table 3 presents the significantly strong
association of the variable “ability to articulate when
discussing the venture” with “ the venture was referred
to us by a trustworthy source,” and moderate association
with variables such as ability to evaluate and react to
risk,” “degree of leadership demonstrated in the past,”
and “track record relevant to venture.” Successful venture
teams seem to convince the people who can refer them to
venture capitalists. They also may have used the skill of
articulation in leading teams in the past.
Some other significantly strong association between
the variables, as shown in Panel D, Table 3 are: association
between “attention to details” and “familiarity with
market targeted by the venture,” and association between
“familiarity with market targeted by the venture” and
“degree of leadership demonstrated in the past.” A
moderate negative association is found between

“familiarity with market targeted by the venture” and
“familiarity with venture team,” and a moderate positive
association between “track record relevant to venture”
and “degree of leadership demonstrated in the past.” The
negative relationship between the market familiarity and
familiarity with venture team indicates that in order to
be a successful venture team, it is not necessary to know
the target market. Even if venture teams deal with newer
opportunities, they may still be successful.

Dif

Association of Variables among Table 4 presents the
association between variables pertaining to entrepreneurial team and variables that measure the criteria
of product. We also present the association between
entrepreneurial team variables and performance criteria
variables.
The venture capitalists seem to be in agreement on
the association between “capable of sustained efforts,”
on the one hand and “sales,” “profits,” and “ROI,” on the
other hand (Panel A, Table 4). Venture capitalists in India
agree that successful ventures deliver results by meeting
their expectations about sales and ROI because they put
in sustained efforts.
We may notice in panel B of Table 4 that there is
significantly strong negative relation between “ability to
evaluate and react to risk” and “the product had been
developed to the point of functioning prototype,” “the
product was hi-tech” and “ROI.” This variable is moderately related with “profits.” The negative relationships

between “ability to evaluate and react to risk” and
“functioning prototype” and “hi-tech product” implies
that successful ventures need not be hi-tech enterprises
or they may involve the use of tested technology. It may
be inferred that Indian venture capitalists do not get
enamoured of the technology. They do invest in
technology intensive projects but totally untried
technologies may receive more stringent evaluation and
investment would flow with great amount of caution.
Since they invest in tested technology, they are relatively
less risky; therefore, these projects meet the requisite
performance criteria such as ROI and profits.
Panel C presents highly significant and strong
association between “ability to articulate when discussing
the venture” with the performance variables of “general
administration cost,” “profits,” and “ROI.” Successful
teams deliver results because they are convinced about
the venture’s prospects and they convince others also
about its prospects especially their own management team
that takes care of the general administration.
Significantly strong negative relationship can be
seen in Panel D between “familiarity with market targeted
by the venture” with “the product had been developed to
the point of functioning prototype” and “the product was
hi-tech.” Also, a moderate negative relationship can be
seen with “protection of product.” This relationship
further confirms the earlier conclusions that successful
ventures need not involve hi-tech ideas, they may not
have protected products also, and they may rather cater
to established markets. The variable “degree of leadership

ability demonstrated in the past” has a strong negative
relationship with the variable “the product was hi-tech.”
This again suggests that the entrepreneurial teams’
achievements in the past need not be purely related to hitech industries.
The variable “track record relevant to venture” shows
a moderate negative relation with the variable “the
product enjoyed demonstrated market acceptance” in
Panel E. Its relation with certain other performance
variables seems to be highly significant such as “sales,”
“general administration,” “profits,” and “ROI.” The
moderate negative relationship between track record and
demonstrated market acceptance may be explained as
the track record of entrepreneurial team seems to be a
very important criterion especially when the product does
not enjoy market acceptance. With the impeccable past
record, successful venture teams have created markets
for their ventures and achieved desired results in terms
of performance. Their experience did make a lot of
difference to the general administration.
In Panel F, the results indicate that the variable “we
were already familiar with venture team’s reputation”
has highly significantly strong negative association with
“protection of product,” and strong positive association

with “sales,” “profits,” and “ROI.” This again suggests
that successful venture teams need not have a protected
product to give the desired results. Venture capitalists in
India seem to have a good experience of funding familiar
venture teams.
Table 5 presents the results of Kendall’s tau-c depicting the association between the variables of entrepreneurial team and variables that define the market.
Also, it presents the association of variables of entrepreneurial team and variables of financial considerations.
In Panel A of the table, the variable “capable of sustained
efforts” has a highly significant and strong negative
association with the variable “the venture would create
a new market” and moderate negative relationship with
the variable “the venture would easily be made liquid.”
It may be inferred from the above results that successful
venture teams have put in their effort in established
markets rather than new markets. Also, these venture
teams’ ventures were illiquid. Similarly, the variables such
as “ability to evaluate and react well to risk,” “familiarity
with the target market,” and “degree of leadership
demonstrated in the past” also show significant negative
relationship with the variable “the venture would create
a new market” in Panel B. This confirms that successful

ventures were less risky and were catering to known target
markets because they were not dealing with new markets.
Since they were not new markets, entrepreneurial teams
delivered good results because of their past experience.
Panel C shows that the variable “attention to details”
has a positive relationship with variables such as
“competition was present or was anticipated” and
“expected return equals at least ten times our investment.”
The inference may be that successful ventures never
ignore details related to competition and factor in the
element of competition in their action plans. Hence, they
meet the expectation of high returns. The variable also
reports moderate negative relationship with “the venture
can be easily made liquid” and “would not be expected
to make subsequent investments” which supports the
earlier conclusion that venture capital investments are
illiquid and are mostly single investments with no
subsequent rounds of investments.
From Panel D we notice that the variable “track record
relevant to venture” has highly significant association
with variables such as “there was a well established
distribution channel,” and “the venture had access to the
distribution channel.” The variable shows moderate
positive relationship with “the market would be
stimulated” and “competition was present or was anticipated.” It reports a moderate negative relationship with
“the venture can be easily made liquid.” Successful venture team target market had an established distribution
channel and the venture had access to it. These markets
were stimulated by successfully warding off the com-

petition. Panel D also presents the association between
the variable “familiarity with venture team” and “the
market would be stimulated” supports this discussion
that successful venture teams were capable of stimulating
the existing market to make a place for themselves.

We used Wilcoxon Signed Rank test to test the difference
in variable pairs of both successful and unsuccessful
ventures as rated by venture capitalists.. The decision
criterion would be to reject the null hypothesis that the
treatments received by successfully and unsuccessfully
managed ventures are same, when the critical probability
values of Wilcoxon table calculated for the sums of
positive ranks at a particular sample size are less than or
equal to the a level at which the test is performed, i.e., 99
per cent (Siegel and Castellan, 1988). The analysis from
Table 6 reports the findings where the null hypothesis is
rejected, where the table value is less than the test value.
The four variables that are highly unique to successful
venture teams are: (1) ability to evaluate and react to risk,
(2) attention to details, (3) market share, and (4) profits.
These findings confirm the earlier analysis that successful
venture teams take calculated risks. They are in a better
position to assess the risk involved in a project than
unsuccessful teams. Successful teams achieve the expected market share by focusing their efforts on established
markets and penetrate these markets to achieve profits,
while unsuccessful teams often fail on these counts.

CONCLUSIONS
The study attempted to analyse the screening factors used
by venture capitalists that help them in identifying successful venture teams and evaluating the attributes that
distinguish the successful ventures from the unsuccessful
ones. Using Kendall’s tau-c analysis, a strong association
between several variable pairs was brought out. Broadly,
the analysis found that successful venture teams put in
sustained efforts on identified target markets and are
highly meticulous while attending to the details. These
teams are adept at dealing with risk because of their
impeccable past experience.
Indian venture capitalists do not seem to be biased in
favour of the technology ventures. A number of the successful
ventures funded by them are not hi-tech. Successful venture
funded companies are sound business plans with or without
technology. Most of these companies cater to established
markets and they have not created new markets. Their target
markets have well established distribution channel to which
they have access. Hence, successful venture funded
companies basically are less risky.
The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test confirms the findings
by distinguishing the successful ventures from unsuccessful ones. The test brought out four important variables
which are highly unique to successful ventures in India
which are: (a) ability to evaluate and react to risk, (b)
attention to details, (c) market share, and (d) profits. The
unsuccessful ventures, it seems, had problems in

evaluating risk. Since successful teams focus on
established markets and meticulously pursue these
markets to gain market share, they achieve desired profits.
Future research may explore the process of screening
and evaluation by investigating the same through other
means such as qualitative technique and techniques from
cognitive psychology. The aspect of accuracy of venture
capitalists’ introspection would be an interesting area to
study. Unless more research is conducted in the cognitive
process of venture capitalist’s decision-making, our
understanding would be insufficient.
Research on venture capital and the emerging growth
companies has fallen short of comprehensive understanding of the processes involved. Understanding the
process of interaction between venture capitalists and
investee companies will enable researchers to evolve the
criteria of success and failure. Research in this area never
attracted researchers’ attention partly because of the lack
of data in India regarding investee companies and partly
due to the fact that researchers have been slow to employ,
test, and modify modern financial economic theory into
venture capital-investee firm research. In the study of
venture capital finance and investment, several areas of
finance theory provide attractive research opportunities.
Certainly, modern portfolio theory should be applied to
venture capital activity in analysing the issues involved
in selecting and appraising the performance of competing
venture funds with different investment philosophies.
