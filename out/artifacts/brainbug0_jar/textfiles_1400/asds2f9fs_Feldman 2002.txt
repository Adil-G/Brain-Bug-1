merican universities are experimenting with new mechanisms for promoting the commercialization of academic research and generating revenue from university intellectual
property. This paper discusses mechanisms available to universities in managing the commercialization of intellectual property, considering equity as a technology transfer mechanism
that offers advantages for both generating revenue and aligning the interests of universities,
industry and faculty. Employing data from a national survey of Carnegie I and Carnegie
II institutions, we document the recent rise in university equity holdings. We present and
estimate a model that considers the university’s use of equity to be a function of behavioral
factors related to the university’s prior experiences with licensing, success relative to other
institutions, and the organization of the technology transfer ofﬁce, as well as structural characteristics related to university type.

Introduction

American universities are experimenting with new
mechanisms for promoting the commercialization of
academic research and generating revenues from university intellectual property. The 20 years since the
passage of the Bayh–Dole Act have witnessed a search
to optimize, or, more pragmatically, to balance the
objectives of managing intellectual property rights,
developing new revenue sources, and accommodating faculty interests while simultaneously maintaining norms related to the conduct of academic research
and the dissemination of research ﬁndings. Based on
their own experiences with patent and licensing activities as well as from lessons learned from the experiences of other institutions, universities have experi0025-1909/02/4801/0105$5.00

mented with, and embraced, alternative mechanisms
of intellectual property transfer.
Equity positions in companies, as a payment for the
use of university intellectual property, are one emerging mechanism. Agreements in which a university
takes an equity interest in a company in exchange
for providing the company the right to use university
intellectual property is becoming common.1 The Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM)
ﬁrst reported on this trend in 1995. In 1999, 79 of
190 institutions responding to the AUTM survey had

taken equity positions in 243 ﬁrms (AUTM 1999). Our
survey of research universities, conducted in Spring
2000 shows that 1978 was the earliest date reported
for an equity deal. By 1992, 40% of our respondents
were taking equity in companies licensing their technology, and, in 2000, 70% had participated in at least
one equity deal (see Figure 1). While equity was initially conceived as a last resort means of accepted
payment reserved for cash-starved start-up ﬁrms, the
use of equity now extends to more established companies as part of a diversiﬁed compensation scheme.
The number of universities using equity licensing
transactions, coupled with the emergence of equity in
a more diversiﬁed set of bargaining situations, suggests some strategic net advantages. By net advantages, we mean comparisons of the costs and beneﬁts of equity positions relative to the costs and
beneﬁts of alternative technology transfer revenuegenerating options. University technology transfer
operations have multiple objectives as determinants
of intellectual property strategy. Faculty retention,
closer university–industry linkages, enhanced university prestige, and, more generally, enhanced and
accelerated technology transfer for the social and economic beneﬁt of the national or regional economy
are core objectives named by university respondents
(Thursby et al. 2001). As no single technology transfer mechanism may ideally suit these multiple objectives, universities are experimenting with different
mechanisms.

In this paper, we describe three advantages to taking equity positions in lieu of licensing fees that interviewees cited as important from the perspective of
the university. First, equity provides a university with
options or ﬁnancial claims on a company’s future
income streams. The attractiveness of the option is
consistent with the uncertainty associated with the
technical and economic characteristics of academic
patents and with the experience-based assessment
that the opportunity cost of foregone license and royalty revenue is generally low. Second, equity deals,
in which the university becomes part owner of the
company, are reported by our interviewees to align
the interests of the university and the ﬁrm towards
the common goal of commercializing the technology.
Equity also may mitigate the potential for disputes
and litigation about intellectual property between the
university and the industry and the potential for conﬂicts of interest that can arise if a faculty member
shifts loyalty away from the university and towards
the company developing their intellectual property
(Jensen and Thursby 2001). Third, according to our
interviewees, equity may serve a certiﬁcation function that provides a signal to relevant third parties.
From the perspective of the university, taking equity
may signal to the outside world that the university
is entrepreneurial. For the ﬁrm, an equity deal may
signal to other investors that the ﬁrm has received a
valuable technology from the university and that the
university is conﬁdent in the value of technology that

the ﬁrm holds. This may enhance the ﬁrm’s ability to
receive additional funding.
Interviewees also noted the risks and negative
aspects of taking equity besides those associated with
low or zero economic payoff. On many campuses,
the decision to take equity occurred only after considerable debate about the propriety of extending the
university involvement in the commercialization of
academic knowledge into holding direct ownership
stakes in ﬁrms. Some critics saw equity holdings as
increasing the risk that the university might be held
liable or suffer from adverse publicity for product
defects. The claimed beneﬁt of improved alignment
with the interests of a ﬁrm was also seen as lending credence to charges that the university was losing
sight of its traditional role as a generator of knowledge as a public good and as an independent societal
source of expertise on complex scientiﬁc and technical issues. The following discussion of the relative
attractiveness of equity and licensing as compensation
mechanisms abstracts from these considerations.
Cataloguing the pros and cons of alternative mechanisms, however, is essentially a static task. Technology transfer ofﬁcials expressed many of these same
assessments about the relative attractiveness of equity
and licensing in the mid-1980s (Feller 1990). Few,
however, entered into equity arrangements at that
time. Drawing on data from a survey of Carnegie I
and II research universities, we offer a set of ﬁndings about the spread of equity holdings among
universities and the patterns that exist among universities in their willingness to use the equity mechanism. The conceptual model we develop treats the
move to equity as an adaptation to the problems
and inadequacies of traditional licensing agreements.
Our inquiry is cast in terms of a model of institutional change and adaptation conditioned by learning
and the diffusion of best practices, and organizational
incentives and behavior.

Why Equity Has Emerged As a
Technology Transfer Mechanism

The provisions of the Bayh–Dole Act established universities’ property rights over federally funded inventions and encouraged universities to actively promote
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

the transfer of those inventions to commercial use.
The initial university response was to create technology transfer ofﬁces to secure intellectual property
rights through patents, and endeavor to sell rights
to use those patents to ﬁrms. Three patterns have
emerged. First, the number of patents received by universities increased to the point where 3,151 patents—
5%, of the U.S. total patents in 1998—were granted
to universities. Second, the number of universities
receiving patents has increased (Henderson et al.
1998, Mowery and Ziedonis 1999). This corresponds
to an increase in the number and size of university
technology transfer ofﬁces (Association of American
Universities 1986, Seigel et al. 1999, Rogers et al. 2000,
Thursby et al. 2001). Third, and most important to this
inquiry, the mechanisms used to transfer technology
and to attain revenue from intellectual property rights
have changed and evolved. These changes reﬂect the
greater sophistication and learning that have come
with the experience derived from each university’s
own involvement in patent and licensing as well as
lessons learned from the experience of other institutions. The purpose of the next section is to consider
university experience with traditional licensing agreements and then evaluate the reasons for the growing
adoption of equity deals.
Licensing Reconsidered
Licensing agreements typically involve selling a company the rights to use a university’s inventions in
return for revenue in the form of upfront fees at the
time of closing the deal, and annual, ongoing royalty
payments that are contingent upon the commercial
success of the technology in a downstream market.
The terms of the licensing agreement depend upon
the assessment of the value of the technology in a
product market that is often uncertain and thus difﬁcult to evaluate. While there are some standards,
many provisions of the royalty agreement are negotiated. Bray and Lee (2000) report that license issue
fees typically range from $10,000 to $50,000 but may
be as high as $250,000, while royalty rates are typically 2% to 5% but may be as high as 15%.2 The
bargaining power of the two parties may be very
2

This is the same range reported by Feller (1990).

107

<-----Page 3----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON
Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

uneven depending upon such factors as their relative
sophistication, experience and resources, established
industry-speciﬁc yardsticks, and the perceptions of
the attributes of the technology, such as its commercial promise and distance to market. As a result, the
deals negotiated between one ﬁrm and several universities or between one university and its licensees
may be very different.
There are many positives to university technology
licensing. First, an active license program has both
substantive and symbolic importance: It attests to the
capabilities of universities to advance technology and
to serve as an engine of growth for both national and
local economies. Second, an active technology transfer organization (TTO) with a large number of active
licenses has become an instrument that the university
can use in recruiting and retaining faculty.3 Interviews
with TTO ofﬁcials at several universities indicate that
some prospective faculty seek meetings with these
ofﬁcials to determine if the university is a congenial
home to their prospective entrepreneurial activities.
Current trends in patents and licensing suggest
mixed patterns, however. The continuing upward
annual trend in patents, licenses, and license revenues
reported in the AUTM 1999 survey suggests that academic licensing still is growing, with most institutions reporting more licensing revenue than they did
the previous year.4 Still, there is evidence that despite
these rising totals, traditional licensing as a technology transfer mechanism has not yielded major ﬁnancial returns for most institutions.
Efforts by universities to secure revenues from
licensing have been hindered by the fact that the standards for securing patents for intellectual property
3
The right of faculty to share in the licensing revenue was a provision of the Bayh–Dole Act. Although substantial royalty windfalls have been reported for a small number of faculty, the after-tax
return to faculty from royalties in general has been reported as relatively disappointing, comparing unfavorably with the revenue that
faculty earn from consulting (Blake 1993).
4

For the 82 recurrent respondents that reported data for the period
FY 1991–FY 1999, the total increased from $149 million to $655 million. These revenues, while small in comparison with other university revenue sources, are not insigniﬁcant.

108

are not equivalent to the requirements for commercial success.5 In a recent survey of technology transfer ofﬁcers, Jensen and Thursby (2001) found that
only about 12% of the licensed technology is ready
for commercialization. The majority of licensed technology requires signiﬁcant developmental work and
ongoing cooperation by faculty to realize commercial
success.
Only a small subset of invention disclosures generate any licensing interest; of those that do, very
few generate sizeable net returns. The rule of thumb
in university technology transfer is that for every
100 invention disclosures, 10 patents and 1 commercially successful product result (Blake 1993). The
distribution of licensing revenues is highly skewed
with a few big commercial successes generating large
returns for a small number of universities. Wellknown licenses. such as the Cohen Boyer gene splicing technique (University of California and Stanford),
Gatorade (University of Florida), Cisplatin (Michigan
State), Fax technology (Iowa State), or Taxol (Florida
State University) are the exceptions rather than the
rule.6
Finally, biomedical invention accounts for a substantial share of academic licenses (Mowery et al.
1999, Feller et al. 2000), and commercialization of
these products requires navigating the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval process, which takes
an average of 10 years. Considering that additional
development is needed to convert the licensed technology into a viable product before a ﬁrm even can
begin the long approval process, long lag times exist
before the receipt of any royalties by the university.7
Equity, in contrast, may provide a ﬁnancial return in
5
The basic principle is well known. For example, as articulated
by Niels Reimers, formerly of the Ofﬁce of Technology Licensing, Stanford University: “The bad news is that the technology
is underdeveloped and unproven, and a signiﬁcant investment is
required by the company for development and ultimately may be
unsuccessful for market or technological reasons. The good news is
that often a basic patent position will be available” (Reimers 1989).
6
Taxol, for example, the patent owned by the Florida State University, has worldwide annual sales worth $1.2 billion and is expected
to yield $60 million in licensing revenue this year (Zacks 2000).
7

Indeed, several of our survey respondents expressed frustration
with licensing as a transfer mechanism due to this time lag.

<-----Page 4----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON

the case of an Initial Public Offering or an acquisition
by another ﬁrm.
Further, there is evidence that licensing has not
been an entirely satisfactory mechanism from the
industry perspective, either. In a survey of industry licensing executives, Thursby and Thursby (2000a)
found that 66% (199 business units out of a total of
300) had not licensed intellectual property from universities. The reasons given included the feeling that
university research is generally at too early a stage of
development (49%); that universities rarely engage in
research in a related line of business (37.4%); university refusal to transfer ownership to company (31%);
university policies regarding delay of publication are
too strict (20%); and concerns about obtaining faculty cooperation for further development of the technology (16%).8 In sum, there is evidence of industry
reluctance to licensing.
Equity Considered
In the immediate post-Bayh–Dole period, university technology transfer ofﬁces generally considered
equity-based licenses to be a compensation mechanism of last resort reserved for cash-starved, startup ﬁrms. “Start-ups rarely have a positive cash ﬂow
during their ﬁrst years of operation; therefore, taking
equity in such start-ups partially in lieu of cash fees
is an important technique to conserve the company’s
cash for investment in product development” (AUTM
1999, p. 17.) Although relative to the ﬁxed upfront
fees and standard royalty rates of traditional licenses,
equity held the promise of enabling the university to
share in potentially larger revenues if a licensee ﬂourished as a result of use of the university’s patents,
these revenues were perceived to be highly uncertain.
The high failure rate of new ﬁrms was well known.
Acting as would be predicted by the well-established
certainty effect (Kahneman and Tversky 1979, Tversky and Kahneman 1992), technology transfer ofﬁcers
valued the relatively certain expected revenues accruing from traditional licenses more than the uncertain,
8
Twenty-eight percent of the respondents indicated some other
difﬁculty such as “general attitude is poor,” “complexity of deal
and   weird expectations,” “too cumbersome” and “high licensing
fees” Thursby and Thursby (2000a).

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

though potentially higher, expected revenues associated with equity deals.
With the exception of a few universities such as
MIT that made equity a core part of its technology
transfer and licensing portfolio, most universities at
ﬁrst accepted equity deals in those cases where the
university believed that a patent had economic value
but no established ﬁrm was able to pay the required
fees and royalties of a traditional license.9 Even if the
expected returns did not materialize, the university
might still realize value by advancing its objectives of
disseminating knowledge, getting the technology out
for commercialization, and, in some cases, accommodating the interests of the faculty inventors.10
Our interviews with technology transfer ofﬁcers
suggest that this perception of equity as the mechanism of last resort has changed. Three main factors appear to underlie this evolution. The ﬁrst is the
increased experience of TTOs with traditional licensing. This has resulted in a greater understanding of
the limitations of this transfer mechanism in terms of
a downward revision in expectation about licensing’s
revenue-generating potential.11 In contrast, equity is
perceived to offer an advantage as the potential return
9

JHU took its ﬁrst equity deal in 1993 for the use of intellectual
property that was licensed to a ﬁrm called CardioLogic. Larger
ﬁrms had been approached but were not interested in the technology, which faculty and TTO staff believed was an important
invention. The only mechanism that would allow the technology
to be licensed was an equity deal with a start-up ﬁrm.
10

Duke University’s involvement in one of early equity deals in
1987 follows such a scenario. Though the faculty inventor expressed
strong interest in taking the technology to a start-up of his own,
the university insisted on ﬁrst trying to license it to an established
ﬁrm. They were successful in this. However, the license was subsequently reacquired from the initial licensee—a large, established
pharmaceutical company—due to the company’s failure to move
the technology forward. At that point, the university still chose
to spend an additional year seeking to make a deal with another
established ﬁrm before accepting a license-for-equity deal with the
ﬁrm established by the inventor.

11

The earliest university licenses were granted on an exclusive basis
that provided no limits on the company’s use of the intellectual
property. Exclusive licenses gave the company total control over the
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY in all potential applications, markets
and adaptations. However, our interviews revealed that increasingly licenses are nonexclusive with stipulated limits on technology
application, geographic scope or terms of use.

109

<-----Page 5----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON

is based on the total assets of the ﬁrm, which is
expected to be greater than the return to any individual product. Second, TTOs, as well as ﬁrms, have
begun to appreciate the mutual beneﬁts of equity in
aligning university-ﬁrm interests. Third, interviewees
believe that equity more so than licensing provides
prestige and legitimacy for both the university and
the ﬁrm. We discuss these arguments within the context of pertinent theoretical frameworks in the sections below.
The Upside Revenue Potential of Equity
In discussing the advantages of equity-based licenses,
many of our respondents cited the upside potential
of this transfer mechanism. Through equity, the university has the opportunity to beneﬁt from future
products or processes that increase the technical and
economic value of the ﬁrm. This view of equity is
not new; however, for several reasons the perceived
value of equity has increased over the past 10 years
compared to the value ascribed to traditional licensing. First, as discussed, many universities have been
disappointed by the revenue-generating performance
of their traditional licenses. Not only have relatively
fewer inventions resulted in licenses than had been
hoped, but also the majority of these licenses have
provided only moderate, if any, returns. The opportunity cost of taking an equity option is the forgone revenues that the university could receive had it negotiated a traditional license with upfront fees, milestone
payments, and running royalties. Given that universities have learned from their own experiences and the
experiences of other universities that this opportunity
cost is, on average, relatively low, the decision to trade
traditional licensing revenues for equity holdings has
become more attractive.
Second, many respondents noted that equity has
the advantage in providing the university with an
opportunity to share in the fortunes of a ﬁrm rather
than just in the fortunes of a technology that may
have contributed to the development of the ﬁrm but
did not directly result in a commercial product. While
traditional licensing agreements are speciﬁc to the use
of a particular patent, equity deals provide a means
for the university to share in the company’s success
even in the event that no licensing royalties accrue
110

to the original technology. The technology covered
by university patents and licenses are typically far
away from the commercial market and may not result
in a viable commercial product. However, a ﬁrm’s
experience with the licensed technology may provide knowledge that is incorporated into subsequent
products and materially contribute to the company’s
ultimate commercial success. Equity deals permit the
university to capture at least some of the returns associated with such knowledge transfer. In the worst-case
scenario—where the original technology proves to be
completely worthless—the university still can beneﬁt from an equity deal if the selected partner proves
viable. Equity holdings yield a portfolio that captures
a broad range of potential futures. In this respect,
equity has come to be perceived as being less risky
than traditional licenses.
Third, there is a broader recognition that holding
an equity position permits the university to buy time,
waiting to exercise its option (i.e., sell its equity) until
uncertainty about the economic value of its patent
holdings is reduced (Vonortas and Hertzfeld, 1998).
Again, academic patents typically are early-stage
technological developments characterized by high
degrees of technical and market uncertainty. To bring
the technology under an academic patent to market often requires considerable follow-on research,
as well as additional costs for approval (in the case
of drugs), production, and distribution. With a traditional license, the university has little option but
to negotiate the upfront fees, milestone payments,
and ﬁxed royalty rates in the shadow of this uncertainty. To deal with such uncertainty, the universities tend to adopt standard industry-speciﬁc running
royalty rates, or to rely on technology licensing ofﬁcials with expertise in selected technological ﬁelds.
The ﬁrst technique drives the institution’s negotiating
position to the average rate of return for licenses in a
ﬁeld, while the latter entails additional administrative
costs. In fact, the latter is feasible only for those institutions with sizeable numbers of patents, clustered
into discernible utility or industry classes. Employment of either of these techniques effectively reduces
overall licensing returns. In comparison, equity deals
look relatively more attractive. If the company has an
Initial Public Offering or is acquired before achieving
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 6----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON
Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

a marketable product equity may provide a shorter
time horizon to revenue realization.
Finally, it must be noted that for most of the
1990s—the period when university equity holding
increased—the performance of the stock market, and
of technology stocks in particular, had been quite positive.12 University personnel, evaluating the potential
of equity against this backdrop, were likely to perceive the returns of equity to be quite promising.
The Incentive Alignment Value of Equity
Another recurring theme that emerged from our discussions with technology-transfer ofﬁcers was the
view that equity more so than licensing was a means
to align the interests of the university and the licensing ﬁrm. Three aspects of alignment were stressed: (1)
common goals related to the appreciation of the value
of the ﬁrm and the commercialization of the technology; (2) relative ease of initial contractual negotiations; and (3) provision for ongoing, within agreement, decision-making and adjustment. Each of these
is discussed in turn.
Several technology transfer ofﬁcers emphasized the
beneﬁts provided by equity-based licenses by aligning the long-term interests of the ﬁrm and the university. With equity, both parties gain as the total
value of the licensed technology, as well as the ﬁrm
as a whole, increases. As such, it is in the best interests of both parties to take actions that enhance the
probability of the ﬁrm’s commercial success. TTO ofﬁcials view this goal alignment as smoothing existing
and future university-ﬁrm technology transfer transactions. As noted by one respondent, a ﬁrm that has
executed an equity-based license can expect to ﬁnd
the going much easier in subsequent negotiations to
sponsor research with, or acquire additional technology rights from, the university. Rather than play hardball in hopes of structuring the best possible one-time,
stand-alone deal, the university—evaluating the new
deal in light of its existing ties—is more likely to strive
to expedite the transaction in a manner that enhances
ﬁrm viability.
12

Interviews were conducted in Summer 2000 before the sharp
decline in the stock market in the second half of the year market.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

A number of respondents also highlighted the comparative ease of constructing an equity-based licensing agreement as compared to the challenge of negotiating a traditional license. Traditional licenses are,
in essence, contracts that specify price, detailed by
level of royalty rates and upfront fees, performance
requirements as reﬂected in milestone payment terms,
and enforcement rights executed through the courts.
An equity-based license changes the focus from contracting on price and performance to agreeing on
ownership shares (i.e., how much stock does the university receive for the right to use the technology?).
Our interviewees suggest that it is easier to agree
on the latter than the former.13 Speciﬁcally, equity
agreements are easier to write as they center on the
delineation of property rights and do not involve
the speciﬁcation of the large number of contingency
terms that a traditional license does. Equity also is
reported to have an advantage over traditional licensing in that it reduces the potential for litigation relating to the ﬁrm’s use of the licensed technology. Consider a case in which a ﬁrm draws upon a university
license in its evolving efforts to develop a commercially viable product, all the while modifying, scrapping, and extending elements of the technology. Each
modiﬁcation opens up new potential for legal conﬂicts about the extent to which the ﬁnal product
makes use of the licensed technology. As the original contract rarely completely (or even signiﬁcantly)
anticipates these developments, there are seldom payment and/or performance terms on point. To resolve
disputes, the university and ﬁrm may attempt to renegotiate in good faith. However, such renegotiations,
given the zero-sum nature of royalty payments, may
be contentious, break down, and lead to litigation. In
an equity deal, contribution disputes are less likely
to produce this outcome as both players share in all
value created.
13

Though prior to taking a ﬁrst equity deal, there is often contentious debates at the university about the proper role of the university and the general framework for all future equity deals, these
deliberations generally come before the university sits down to
negotiate with an individual ﬁrm. Interviewees tell us those subsequent ﬁrm–university negotiations, given the focused nature of the
negotiation on a particular deal, is generally straightforward.

111

Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

The example of The Pennsylvania State University
and AbioMed illustrates this point. Penn State took
equity in AbioMed, a 19-year-old biomedical ﬁrm in
Boston, in exchange for giving the company the rights
to use artiﬁcial heart technology developed at the
Hershey Medical School. AbioMed was working on a
product that would have inevitably been a competitor to the Hershey Heart. Equity became the preferred
compensation mechanism for both parties because it
facilitated the integration of the company’s on-going
research and development work with Penn State intellectual property while avoiding potential future legal
complications.
The Legitimacy Value of Equity
A ﬁnal beneﬁt of equity-based licenses cited by
respondents is the belief that it provides legitimacy
and or prestige for both the ﬁrms and the university. In discussing why ﬁrms seek equity deals, several of the technology transfer ofﬁcers interviewed
noted that beyond the obvious beneﬁt of conserving cash, ﬁrms believe university equity holding
enhanced their credibility.14 Lerner (1999) concludes
that ﬁrms participating in the government Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program grew significantly faster than comparable ﬁrms and were more
likely to attract venture capital ﬁnancing indicating
the government funding conferred a halo effect. A
similar halo may be generated by a university ownership position. Speciﬁcally, our interviews reveal that
a university’s willingness to accept equity in lieu of
up-front fees and/or royalties is believed to provide a
14

Evidence about the existence and direction of legitimacy effects
of equity holdings is indirect and mixed. Shane (2000) in a study of
MIT patents however points to a negative relationship between university equity holdings and the successful commercialization of the
technology covered by the relevant license. The reasoning behind
this ﬁnding involves a restatement of the mainstream motivation
for why universities take equity: No existing ﬁrm believes that the
patented technology is commercially proﬁtable. Start-up ﬁrms that
seek to commercialize such technologies are inherently highly risky
enterprises. Our focus in this paper does not displace these dynamics. The belief, on the part of the ﬁrm, that having a university as
an equity partner adds legitimacy to the ﬁrm’s ventures is not a
guarantee that the ﬁrms will succeed. Exuberant spirits may exist
on both sides of the bargaining table.

112

signal to capital markets and potential strategic partners that the university has made a positive evaluation of the worthiness of the technology and the ﬁrm’s
development competencies. If this signal is perceived
as valuable, it may give the university some advantage in the equity share negotiations and thus enhance
its returns.
Perhaps more salient for our goal of understanding
universities’ use of the equity mechanism is the prestige value that technology transfer personnel believe
that having active licenses conveys to the university.
The university’s willingness to take equity lowers the
cost of licensing the technology and this may generate
more licensing activity. We therefore might expect that
universities with low levels of licensing activity, both
in absolute and relative terms, to adopt taking equity
as a means to increase their measured level of technology transfer activity. Further, there is also a perceived
halo effect of university equity positions. Universities
with a high number of equity deals generally gain
an afﬁrmative reputation for being progressive and
entrepreneurial.
In conclusion, equity appears to provide an improved mechanism for university technology transfer.
Although equity options are not without problems,
our interviews reveal that university ofﬁcials ﬁnd that
equity offers some advantages over traditional licensing agreements based on up-front fees and royalty
payments. The next section develops a set of hypotheses that relate university characteristics to the adoption of equity and presents data that we will use to
test these hypotheses.

Hypotheses and Data

Writing just after Johns Hopkins University took its
ﬁrst equity interest, David Blake, Senior Associate
Dean of the School of Medicine, wrote “Most universities and their trustees are quite comfortable with
accepting royalty payments and sharing them with
faculty inventors under approved formulas. They are
much less comfortable with holding stock in a company that is commercializing a university discovery
(Blake 1993, p. A52).” As noted previously. we have
seen a recent increase in the use of equity in technology transfer. Logically, one can attribute this increase
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 8----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON
Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

in the number of equity transactions to the perceived
attractiveness of this mechanism, as described above.
However, substantial variation exists in both the timing of ﬁrst equity deals and the intensity of equity
involvement across the universities in our sample.
The remaining question, and the one we tackle in this
section, is what factors explain these differing adoption strategies?
We propose a model in which the intensity of a
university’s equity involvement is related to a set of
behavioral and structural variables. The behavioral
variables relate to intra- and interinstitutional learning and adaptation that come with time and experience. The control variables include the Carnegie
Classiﬁcation of the university, the status as a public or private entity, and the afﬁliation with a medical
school.
Direct Technology Transfer Ofﬁce Attributes:
Experience and Structure
One strong association that emerged from our
interviews was that of the relationship between
technology-transfer experience and the perceived
attractiveness of equity as a technology transfer
mechanism. In general, we observed that experience
with traditional licensing give rise to dissatisfaction
with this technique and subsequent experimentation
with new mechanisms. Hands-on experience seemed
to expose previously unconsidered limits of traditional licensing. As TTOs gained experience with traditional licensing mechanisms, they appear to also
become more skeptical about the expected returns
accruing to this transfer mechanism. This greater
understanding of potential limits led to a downward
revision of the transfer mechanism’s relative attractiveness, which, in turn, appears to create a willingness to experiment with alternative transfer mechanisms, such as equity-based licenses.
In addition, universities that have more experience with industry-sponsored research are expected
to have a greater commitment to technology transfer and to be more willing to experiment with new
mechanisms that appear to offer perceived beneﬁts.
As TTOs gain experience with industry through sponsored research they appear to be more willing to
attempt to facilitate increased interaction in technology transfer. Thus, the following hypothesis.
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

Hypothesis 1. The greater a university’s experience
with technology transfer, the more likely the university will
be to adopt equity-based transfer mechanisms.
Along with licensing experience, we argue that the
budgetary policy of the technology transfer ofﬁce may
also inﬂuence equity involvement. While we hypothesize that greater experience leads to greater dissatisfaction with traditional licensing, and thus greater
interest in equity-based transfer deals, willingness to
make this trade-off may be constrained, or secondary,
to immediate budgetary needs. Traditional licenses
generate both certain and uncertain revenue streams.
Up-front fees, the required payments at the origin of a
licensing deal, are immediate and certain. Upon completion of negotiations, the university can expect to
receive these fees. Speciﬁcally, transfer ofﬁces that are
required to be self-supporting may rely on the immediate and certain revenues coming form the up-front
fees of traditional licenses. As noted by March and
Shapira (1987), managers are much less likely to take
risks when organizational survival is at stake. Thus,
the following hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2. The expectation that the technologytransfer ofﬁce should be self-supporting reduces the propensity for the university to adopt equity-based transfer
mechanisms.
Technology Transfer Experience Relative to
Other Institutions
While direct experience is expected to be an important
inﬂuence in the decision to adopt alternative transfer mechanisms, we also argue that the experience of
others also comes in to play. Many of the technologytransfer ofﬁcers we spoke with volunteered that they
commonly benchmark their university’s performance
against the performance of other similar institutions.
The average performance of a cohort comes to represent the minimal acceptable performance level—to
either the TTO or those that are evaluating the TTO.
March and Shapira (1987) and March (1988) argue
that aspirations or performance targets affect risktaking behavior. This may be extended to reﬂect the
expected inﬂuence of traditional license-related performance benchmarks on a university’s propensity to
enter equity-based licenses. Though expected value
113

<-----Page 9----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON
Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

may be high, equity deals are generally perceived
to be more risky than traditional licenses. Equity is
riskier because of its relative novelty—few institutions have had any signiﬁcant experience with this
mechanism. In addition, there is greater potential
return variance associated with equity. While traditional license returns are somewhat narrowly bound
between up-front fees and a percentage of product
sales, equity returns vary more broadly from zero, if
the ﬁrm fails, to some percentage of the ﬁrm’s total
worth.
March and Shapira (1987, p. 1413) argue that managers that are near a performance target will be relatively risk averse. These individuals are expected
to avoid a risky action that may cause performance
to fall below target. However, when performance
exceeds the target by a substantial amount, managers
are more likely to engage in risky behavior in hopes
of capturing the potential up-side beneﬁt. Thus, the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. Leading performers, those performing
substantially above the benchmarked target, will be more
likely than average pwformers to adopt equity-based transfer mechanisms.
For decision-makers who have not been successful
to date—those performing substantially below target
levels—the desire to reach the target will cause them
to focus on opportunities associated with the risky
action (March and Shapira 1987). Any action that may
get them closer to the target is attractive. Because,
these managers are currently doing poorly, they do
not have much to lose if the gamble fails to play out to
their advantage. Thus, these individuals are expected
to have a predilection for risk-prone behavior:
Hypothesis 4. Lagging universities, performing substantially below their cohorts, will be more likely than average performers to adopt equity-based technology transfer
mechanisms.
Description of Survey Data
The most cited source on university technology transfer, the AUTM annual survey, ﬁrst reported data on
university equity agreements in 1995. Over the course
of the survey’s history, however, AUTM has changed
data collection items, adding and dropping variables
114

in response to changes in university practices. The
changes limit the usefulness of these surveys to discern trends. As a result, researchers interested in more
focused questions have used mail and telephone surveys to collect original data on the equity aspects of
university technology transfer activities. Bray and Lee
(2000), for example, have compared the amount of
revenue received from equity positions versus licensing fees, while Di Gregorio and Shane (2000) have
looked at equity as one dimension in considering why
some universities generate more start-up ﬁrms than
others. Our interest is in understanding equity as part
of a general examination of the evolving character of
university–industry relationships. Thus, as with these
other recent studies, our research involved a series
of telephone interviews with university technology
licensing and transfer ofﬁcials.
In Summer 2000, we conducted a survey of the 124
Carnegie I and II research universities that have active
technology transfer operations.15 The letter that introduced the survey was addressed to the head of the
TTO as identiﬁed by AUTM or the university’s web
page. We contacted each university ofﬁcial at least
three times to attempt to set up the survey interview.
The interview protocol asked about university practices related to equity, among other questions related
to the organization and function of the TTO. The
majority of the 124 institutions (76%) participated in
the AUTM survey on a regular basis.
We received 67 responses, for a response rate of
54%. Comparison of the respondents with the total
universe of universities indicates no biases in terms of
structural characteristics (e.g., Carnegie Classiﬁcation,
public/private, land grant/non–land grant, medical
school/no medical school). Our model estimation is
based on 62 observations. Lack of data on some of
15

Under the Carnegie classiﬁcation, Research Universities I award
50 or more doctorates each year and annually receive $40 million
or more in federal research support. Research Universities II are the
same as Research I universities except that they receive between
$15.5 million and $40 million annually in federal research support.
This classiﬁcation system will be undergoing major changes in the
near future. Only one institution, Howard University, did not have
an ofﬁce of technology transfer or some individual whom we were
able to identify as being assigned technology transfer as their primary responsibility.

the independent variables from sources other than
our survey necessitated omitting ﬁve institutions from
our econometric estimation. Again, we do not ﬁnd
evidence that the estimation sample is biased with
respect to any measurable characteristics.
In describing the characteristics of our respondents,
we draw upon the full sample of 67. Of the TTO
respondents, 76% indicated that their university had
taken equity in a company. Our ﬁndings are similar to
those from Thursby et al. (2001), who found that 82%
of their 62 responding universities had taken equity as
part of a licensing deal. The similar number of respondents is a coincidence, as the sampling frame of our
respondents differ. The lower rate of universities taking of equity in our sample may be a result of the
greater institutional diversity in our sample frame.
Thirteen universities (19% of our respondents),
each a public university, were prohibited from taking equity in companies because of state statutes that
limit their range of activity. These legislative restrictions do not limit the universities’ initiatives to be in
a legal position to accept equity, however. Of these
universities, 10 formed independent 501(c)3 entities to
manage their intellectual property and to take equity
Figure 2

holdings.16 To date, seven of these entities have taken
equity in lieu of licensing fees for a university invention. Three of the independent entities had not taken
equity at the time of our interview.
University ofﬁcials were asked the total number
of equity deals in which they had participated. Our
respondent set of 67 universities participated in 679
equity deals. The distribution of the number of deals
is highly skewed as shown in Figure 2. The mean
number of equity transactions was 10.3, the median
was 5 and the mode was 0. The maximum number of
equity deals was 90.
Dependent Variable. The dependent variable for
our study is the intensity of equity involvement. We
measure this variable as the total number of a university’s equity interests divided by the number of the
university’s active licenses for 1998. Active licenses
are the cumulative number of licenses that had not
terminated by the end of the 1998.
The total number of equity deals is from our survey, veriﬁed against the AUTM survey. The number of active licenses is from the 1998 AUTM survey.
For universities that did not routinely participate in

An example is the Ohio State University Research Foundation.
Other institutions that have not been subject to statutory limitations have formed this type of entity to serve as a bridging
mechanism. For example, the University of Illinois system formed
Illinois Ventures as an intermediary institution to focus on commercializing university intellectual property.

Figure 3

Distribution of the Intensity of the Use of Equity: Equity Deals As a Percentage of All Active Licensing Agreements

AUTM, we gathered data on the number of active
licenses from web pages or from our interviews.
There is variation in the use of equity deals as a
percentage of all intellectual property licenses (see
Figure 3). For our respondents, the percentage of
equity deals accounted for a mean value of 14.4%, and
a median of 8.5%. The maximum use of equity was
88.1% indicating that this respondent used equity for
the vast majority of their intellectual property agreements. This last statistic is an artifact of the relatively
small number of licensing agreements at this university, as well as to other universities in the upper tail
of the distribution. To adjust for this skewnesss, we
weight our regression model to mitigate the effect of
outliers who appear to have made high use of equity
simply because they did not have many licensing
opportunities.
Independent Variables. The technology transfer
experience of the university provides the independent variable for Hypothesis 1. We use three measures of experience: (1) age of the technology transfer ofﬁce; (2) cumulative number of executed licenses
(1991–1998); and (3) the log of the cumulative amount
of industrial research support received (1991–1998).
These data are from the annual AUTM surveys, veriﬁed and augmented by our survey and institutional
data from the National Science Foundation’s Com116

puter Aided Science Policy Analysis and Research
(CASPAR) database.
For Hypothesis 2, the budgetary structure of the
technology transfer ofﬁce is the independent variable
of interest. Using our survey data, we construct a
dummy variable equal to 1 if the expectation is that
the technology-transfer ofﬁce will be self-supporting,
0 otherwise. Roughly, half (47%) of the respondent
ofﬁces in our survey had expectations of being selfsupporting.
The university’s technology transfer experience relative to others is the independent variable for the ﬁnal
two hypotheses. Our interviews revealed that TTOs
are sensitive to the amount of intellectual property
activity they have relative to a cohort of similar institutions. Our interviews revealed that status, as either
a public or private institution, the presence of a medical school, and some measure of the level of intellectual property income relative to an institution’s
total R&D expenditures were considerations in deﬁning one’s cohort. Accordingly, we grouped institutions
into four cohorts based on status as either a public
or private institution and the presence or absence of
a medical school: public/with medical school; public/no medical school; private/with medical school;
private/no medical school. To construct the cohort
variable of licensing income relative to R&D expenditures we calculated the total annual licensing revManagement Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

enues from 1991–1998 relative to the university’s total

interests divided by the number of active university
licenses in 1998. The equity share of active university licenses is thus a fraction that is truncated at zero
and bounded by one at the upper level. There are ten
cases for which the number of equity deals was zero,
which is the lower bound for our data. We therefore
use the lower-bound TOBIT model and the number of
1998 licensing agreement is used as an analytic weight
in the model to pt-wide robust estimation (Maddala
1983, Greene 2000).
Models 1 and 2 estimates the use of equity as a
function of the university’s own technology-transfer
experience. The results indicate that the university’s
prior experience in technology-transfer matters in the
118

use of equity. The age of the technology-transfer
ofﬁce is positively related to the university’s use of
equity as expected. The older the university’s ofﬁce
of technology-transfer ofﬁce the greater the use of
equity as a percentage of intellectual property transactions. This result is consistent with Bray and Lee
(2000) conclusion, based on interviews at 10 university technology-transfer ofﬁces. that ofﬁces that have
been in existence longer are much more likely to
consider taking equity than is a ﬂedgling technology
transfer program.
The effect of the cumulative number of licensing agreements on the intensity of equity use is
more complex. In Model 1, the cumulative number
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 14----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON
Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

of licensing agreements is negatively related to the
intensity of use of equity—the greater the experience
with licensing the less likely the university is to make
use of equity. In Model 2, we add a quadratic licensing term that is positive and statistically signiﬁcant.
This indicates that the cumulative licensing experience has a nonlinear relationship on the use of equity.
Speciﬁcally, universities appear more likely to use
equity as they gain experience with licensing but the
relationship resembles an inverted U as the use of
equity decreases when the university has executed a
large number of licenses.
Our ﬁnal measure of the university’s own technology-transfer experience is industrial research support.
We ﬁnd that the log of the amount of average annual
industrial research support is positively related to the
use of equity in Model 2. In sum, we ﬁnd support for
Hypothesis 1.
The effect of the TTO self-sufﬁciency is of the
expected direction for both Models 1 and 2. University technology-transfer ofﬁces that are expected to be
self-sufﬁcient make less use of equity, ceteris paribus,
providing support for Hypothesis 2.
Model 3 estimates the university’s intensity of use
of equity relative to the technology-transfer performance of peer institutions. The experience of the
technology-transfer ofﬁce relative to other institutions
is measured as a dummy variable that is equal to
one if the university respectively lags or leads other
universities in its cohort in terms of average annual
licensing. We ﬁnd that those universities that lag their
cohort make greater use of equity after accounting for
structural characteristics. The coefﬁcient for universities that lead their cohorts is of the expected sign
but is not statistically signiﬁcant. This ﬁnding suggests that universities that are average relative to their
cohort make less use of equity, conﬁrming Hypothesis 3. The coefﬁcient for institutions that lead their
cohort. Hypothesis 4, was of the expected sign but not
statistically signiﬁcant.
Our speciﬁcations also include structural characteristics and the results suggest universities make greater
use of equity deals in technology transfer if they have
a medical school. In addition, Carnegie II research
universities appear to make greater use of equity.
Model 3 reveals that public universities appear to
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

make greater use of equity when they compare themselves to their cohorts.
In sum, the results support the expectation that universities both learn from their own experience and
from the experiences of others. We also ﬁnd that structural characteristics of the university affect the degree
to which the university is able and willing to experiment with equity. Notably, universities with medical
schools made greater use of equity in licensing agreements. Carnegie II research universities also seemed
to be more aggressive in adopting the new mechanism. This fact seems to bear on the relative standing
of these institutions and their desire to advance their
position.

Conclusions

Recent trends towards increased university acceptance of equity as compensation for intellectual property rights represents a new strategic perspective
on intellectual property management and technology
transfer. The older, established view for universities
accepting equity in lieu of licensing fees was that
equity was the only compensation being offered by
cash-starved start-up ﬁrms who were the only party
that would be interested in the university’s patents.
We ﬁnd that equity is increasingly seen by university technology licensing ofﬁces as an attractive mechanism that offers advantages in both increasing the
upside revenue potential of university technology and
improving the alignment between the institution’s
interests and those of the ﬁrm. The adoption of equity
may be seem as part of a trend in which universities
are becoming more entrepreneurial in light of new
opportunities and changing expectations.
These theoretical considerations point to the importance of institutional learning—the product of a university’s own experiences and that of other similar institutions, the characteristics of the technology
transfer ofﬁce, and a set of structural variables—
which all affect the degree to which an institution
accepts equity as a mechanism in its intellectual property licensing transactions. In this paper, we have
developed and tested four hypotheses about the effect
of direct experience, organizational incentives, and
experience relative to a related cohort on the adoption
119

<-----Page 15----->FELDMAN, FELLER, BERCOVITZ, AND BURTON
Equity and Technology Transfer Strategies of American Research Universities

of a new technology transfer mechanism. Our initial
results at testing these relationships, using data from
a national survey of Carnegie I and II research universities and other measures of academic licensing,
support this interpretation.
Our results, though, are limited by both sample size
and the absence of attention to changes over time and
in university policy. In particular, the recent sharp
decline in high-tech stock prices and in IPO share
prices may reduce the allure of the equity option.
In effect, our view of future trends in university holdings of equity is agnostic. Experience cuts both ways.
In many respects, given the recent attention (and
hyperbole) associated with university equity initiatives, we would expect the trend to continue, indeed
to accelerate. All of our respondents indicated that
they expected their university’s use of equity would
increase or stay the same in the next year. Universities are constantly adapting and learning and our
results, and those of other researchers, may relate
primarily to the pre-inﬂexion stage of adoption and
diffusion. On the other hand, any prolonged decline
in stock prices may quickly lead many technologytransfer ofﬁces back into the safe harbor of traditional
licensing arrangements. Asking which route may be
followed is akin to asking whether it is more profitable in today’s market to buy long or sell short. Only
time will tell.
